I do.  I don't think Bitcoin is the perfect solution for every financial transaction any more than I think fiat sucks at everything.
For example, I would **never** tip a service worker in bitcoin any more than I would consider adding a tip to my credit card payment of the bill.  How rude to do either of those to your server/driver/etc.
Cash fiat has valid use-cases.
And yeah, I think a 'real' ATM goes in both directions.  Just like a teller (**A**utomatic **T**eller **M**achine) at a bank...

It would be nice if folks would make an effort - no matter how small - to retain some kind of rational perspective on this.


They're talking about selling roughly $27 million USD worth of bitcoin - when the federal budget for 2014 is estimated to be about 3.8 trillion USD.
So... this massive "Bonanza" represents something like 0.0000071% of the federal budget.
That analogous to somebody earning $50k/yr (after taxes) finding 35 cents on the street.

@_date: 2014-01-04 20:14:40
Yes.  There's always an exception - but I note that firstly, we were discussing ASIC units with positive ROI in a reasonable period of time.
Your Twinfury units don't break even (5GH/sec, .85 W/GH, 250 Euro + **60** Euro S&amp;H) for a bit over a year.  That is not a dependable statistic - I can't accept any estimated numbers past three months or so.  And the pricing there doesn't include the necessary extras to expand:  power supplies, USB backbones, etc.  All of which push ROI past 18 months.
And secondly, we were really kind of talking about TH/sec units.

Biometrics in general are a terrible idea.

If your fingerprints are forged, or compromised in some way - which is *quite* possible and demonstrable - **you can't change them**.  You're fucked forever.

How do you know how many you've got?  Whatever you opened to find out is your wallet.  Unless you went to a mining pool to check your balance?  But in that case, you'll *need* a wallet.
You'll want to go to bitcointalk.org I think - start an account and go through two or three postings and a few hours in the Newbies forum.  Then go to the thread in *Development &amp; Technical &gt; Alternative Clients* that's about your wallet.  They'll be happy to help.
I'd recommend not doing anything until you've done that.  There've been some hiccups, glitches and even a soft fork since the date you mention (2011); **especially** the reference client (bitcoin-qt or bitcoind).  If you were using the reference client, the required upgrades can be tricky:  don't try it unless you're certain of what you're doing.

AKA:  Bullshit.
I've been selling online since *before* there were actual web pages.  And more recently on eBay, since it started.  Here's what I know:
All buyers have is money.
Sellers have **reputation**.  Seller scams don't work because of that - not for long, anyway.
Which isn't to say that all sellers are straight-arrows.  But the potential for fraud with sellers - compared to that of buyers - is about the same as the ratio of sellers to buyers.  Less than 1 in 10, or thereabouts.
@_date: 2014-01-20 07:32:14
The utility value of Bitcoin is quite high, actually - at least according to the VCs and business types who have invested their millions in that particular aspect of Bitcoin's value.  And that's just the *back end* utility value:  business transfer, competition with Western Union/bank transfer, and the like.
*Front end* utility value is even bigger though, I expect:  i.e., the personal *Skype*-type value.  After you allow for all the taxes and government fees, getting value into or out of Argentina - to just about anywhere - saves you almost exactly 50%.  That's how Skype succeeded - by making an essential service (in Skype's case, telephony...) available to immigrants and expatriots for almost nothing, compared to the available, conventional options.
None of which speaks to all the *other* value propositions that Bitcoin offers:  financial hope for the unbanked billions of the world (M-pesa, Kipochi, etc.), shelter from such polite fictions as rehypothecation, effectively what amounts to the elimination of buyer fraud on the internet (which is over 90% of all internet fraud), and so on - the list is long...

Because there is zero incentive for ASIC manufacturers to build or sell them.
You've fallen into the trap of believing what other people - specifically those manufacturers - *want* you to believe.  They are **not** hardware manufacturers; they are miners who have figured out how to subsidize their equipment.
If you take a good hard look at the history of ASIC mining hardware release schedules, you'll discover that these miners don't get released to their purchasers until the possibility of ROI has been pushed so far into the future that it's almost a myth.
Find *one* decent sized ASIC miner you can buy that has an ROI of less than 6-12 (mostly 12) months.  Assuming every possible variable goes perfectly as anticipated - which ain't gonna happen.  And yet, oddly, these ASIC 'manufacturers' *do* appear to get their components in a timely fashion - they just always seem to have difficulties that result in delivery dates getting pushed back.
tl;dr:  The only people who mine successfully at the moment are ASIC manufacturers and people with six-figures in USD to drop on equipment that they go and pick up for cash on the barrelhead.

Almost all credit card fraud is committed by buyers, against sellers.
Most of that fraud is conducted over the internet - because it's easy to use stolen cards that way.
With Bitcoin, fraud against sellers on the internet is impossible.  You get the coin or you don't.  If you get it, you ship.  If you don't, you don't ship.
Bitcoin will eliminate virtually all buyer fraud on the internet.  Billions and billions of dollars saved.

It's only been since July of last year that the lawsuit involving cash discounts in merchants' ToS with credit card companies was resolved.
I've thought for awhile now that a big step on the path to major Bitcoin adoption will be the inevitable lawsuit about whether the CC companies can try the same tactic with Bitcoin.  And whether merchants have the same right (now) to offer *either* discounts for cash/Bitcoin, or surcharges on credit card use.  The distinction comes with a definite difference.
There's a lot to consider.  And oddly enough, internet-only retailers are at a disadvantage - or they were, until Bitcoin came along.  It's only been possible to offer cash discounts at a brick&amp;mortar location.  So now the CC companies are looking at a huge chunk of lost revenue that they never even considered during the last lawsuit.
It's gonna be a helluva court case, I think...

I've been on the 'net since it was text only, long before the web or http.  I started my life's addiction at college, in the 70's, on a mainframe.  It began so slowly that there really wasn't anything political going on - it was just geeks talking to each other and trading files (and we've come full circle there, with a brief and happily forgotten stopover at mousetrails and the *blink* command...).
I don't recall there being any major impacts in meatspace until some bright person figured out how to reliably encode pictures; which gave us porn, and the first viable business models requiring visual presentation - mostly bookselling at first.
It was very underground.  There wasn't any instantaneous method of global communication at the time - *like... oh... the internet... ;-)* - that let folks see what was happening in real time.  It just kind of grew out of the educational backbones, and as people graduated and left *academia*, they realized that the 'net was what they wanted in their homes.  And back in those days you could get a decent job out of college so the expense for a private connection wasn't awful, as a percentage of income.
I honestly don't remember anything political about the internet until places like North Korea and China started banning and controlling it.  And that was well into the days of the web.  Of course, I wasn't anywhere near as politically motivated back then - I'm sure I missed a lot.
I think that yes - there are media comparisons to be made.  The media was a massively trailing indicator for the internet, and I get the same kind of feeling in how they're approaching Bitcoin.  Somehow in the past 50 years or so the MSM have become the gatekeepers of entrenched power - they weren't always like that, y'know - and the *status quo* is where they live.
Personally, I think the internet is the most important revolution in history thusfar - and Bitcoin is its killer app.

Yes - you now have two wallets, separate and distinct from one another.  Think of it as an every day wallet, and a special wallet that you only use when wearing a tuxedo.
So yes - you have to send money to yourself, if you want to use just one wallet.
The best way to deal with it is to have a wallet for your major stash - something very secure like Armory - and a small wallet for day-to-day stuff.  Like on your phone, with QR codes.
Look into security procedures.
Forget about all the uBTC BS.  Just use dollars and BTC, and learn how it works.  Get comfortable with that before you go off into the weeds.

Well no, you don't.  To be included in the price, bitcoins have to be traded on the exchange.  Which means - in addition to fees per trade - you probably wouldn't be able to guarantee that you'd get 100% of your coins back.  Ooops.

You can't get both from the same vendor, I don't think.
But your main question already exists - storing Bitcoin denominated in fiat, so no loss if the rate goes down, and no gain if it goes up.
Euros only at the moment - not that it matters - but they've been bought out by Hive, and USD is coming soon.  It's good - and stable.  I've been using it since it first came out for my day-to-day wallet.  No problems.
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:09:48

The standard reasons (speaking as someone who has sold on eBay almost since the beginning) are: opened package with nothing inside (which works even if signed for), and package never received (which also works even if the Seller got a signed return receipt).
The thing about eBay is that they don't give a fuck about their customers - i.e., the people from whom they get their money.  They care about the Buyers, and will *always* take their side.  So you learn how to be the right kind of careful.
I don't sell anything on eBay for over a hundred bucks or so - and I insure everything, pretty much.  The expensive stuff (I've dealt antiquities for 50 years) I sell on my own website, by invitation only - and now almost exclusively for Bitcoin.

Kind of a bad omen.
We saw the same kind of offers in 2011, when Dwolla screwed Tradehill, and when a couple other exchanges whose names I forget bit the dust.
This also happened with BFL first-gen delivery slots - as ROI plummeted, so did the offered prices.
I note that **rpietila**'s offer was reduced quite quickly.
It's a *very* risky buy...

@_date: 2014-02-10 12:20:45
I absolutely agree that something needs to be done about Gox.  The harm they've brought to Bitcoin over the years has come to - easily - outweigh the benefits.  But I'm not so sure that opening yet another exchange would accomplish much.
I'd be willing to participate in an effort to shut them down for good and all - I'd even donate if I felt there was a decent chance of success.

There are different kinds of convenience.
For example - you can conveniently and easily send a million dollars from a ship off the coast of Antarctica to a monk in Tibet in under a minute, with fees of less than a quarter.  And only have to wait an hour to get six confirmations.

These cards have popped up many times before over the past two or three years.
Basically, it's a bet.
You're betting that you can get enough cash out of a card to justify the high purchase cost and fees - before the company gets shut down by their bank or some government agency.
And honestly, from what I've seen they tend to last for a little while.  Long enough if you stay on top of it.  $200/day for a week means it costs you about $305.50 - $225 for the card + 5% of $1400 (= $70) + $10.50 ($1.50 x 7).  That's 20%, roughly.
$386 for two weeks to get $2800.  13.7%.

If you started mining in 2010, you remember when they were under 50 cents.


If you started mining in 2010, you were almost certainly solo mining:  Slush's pool wasn't released until December 16th, and there were no others.  And forgive me, but on December 16th of 2010 it would not have been possible to get such a small amount as 2.7 BTC, even mining for only 24 hours.  A solo mined block was 50 BTC.  How did you only have a total of 2.7?


When was there a *spike* to $80ish?  I remember a spike to $32ish, and another to $266ish...
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:36:34

Forgive me please.  I may have your answer, but what you've written is not factually clear so I'm not quite sure what's going on here.
After reading the OP and this post which I'm responding to, my sense is that you may possibly be pointing your mining pool output to your Coinbase deposit address.  Is that the case?
If so, that would explain what's happening.  Coinbase has addressed this issue very clearly, several times in the past - they do not accept deposits from Bitcoin addresses that are verifiably not controlled by the depositor.  In this case, if I'm correct in what I'm seeing, the address that is trying to deposit to your Coinbase account is the address of your mining pool - and obviously not under your control.  The reason for this is KYC/AML bullshit - but that's outside of Coinbase's control.
Hope that helps...

Send a formal request *via* email to the netadmin - cc'd to your department chair and the President of your school - requesting input into the roaming profiles (or whatever they're called, depending on your network OS) for all the machines under your control.
Assuming that the President isn't in on it, set up profiles so that nobody can get on the network or get their MAC address allowed, without booting to a secure profile stored on the network that deletes the bad stuff on every boot.  Etc., etc.
On a school network that kind of stuff should already be implemented (I used to be the netadmin at a large University...).  Why isn't it?  If your lab computers boot outside the protections of your school network, they should be on their own, private internal network - a ten-dot for example - and not allowed out except through controls on the main network.

There's your flaw, right there.  From *any* ASIC vendor.
You set it up so you go there when the miner is available and pick it up - cash on the barrelhead - or you'll get screwed.  They all use pre-ordered miners to pre-mine - and they won't ship them until the ROI is used up.
You need to understand that ASIC vendors are not really that - what they are is miners who have figured out a way to get their mining equipment subsidized.  The only people who get their equipment orders as promised are those with six-figure - and higher - orders who pick them up and pay on delivery.

Y'know, this really isn't true.  Yeah, there's some retail operations in the US that are taking Bitcoin.
But the US banking environment isn't exactly ideal.
And when it comes to the *important* stuff - like taxes, and how the government recognizes Bitcoin - well... I'd rather live in Germany, or Slovakia.
Or, given a decent-sized stash, Argentina.

Exactly the same process as any fiat real estate transaction.  Closing table, agent for each party, lawyer for each party... except the attendees would have knowledge about Bitcoin (not that tough these days), and there would be a couple of computers with internet connections.
Security is the burden of he who would like to be secure - so this question:  " Suppose I transfer 500k in bitcoin to the seller and instantly he is hacked and the money is gone?"  is *strictly* the seller's problem.  A verifiable transfer is a verifiable transfer.  Escrow might help.

What are the chances of exchanging an Argentinian Peso for a US Dollar?  And yet it happens all the time, doesn't it?  *And* at a black-market exchange rate of 9.x or 10.x to one, rather than the official rate of 6.x to one.
Of course, there's a 35% tax rate on officially obtained US Dollars - collected *after* they are paid for.  So the official rate is actually quite close to the black market rate.
It's the currency controls that Bitcoin is good for - for your *ordinary Argentinian*.  With Bitcoin, you can go on a vacation.  Or emigrate.  Or send money to a relative in another country.
I expect your response to be:  "yes, but..."

Ripple has a 'huge' market cap because the people of Ripple have essentially declared the value to be what it is - without any input from a free market.
Look at Ripple's volume.  **$78,000** for a commodity with a "huge" market cap of over two billion dollars.  Really?
And while you're at it, look at the trading volume of the *other* two 100% pre-mined alt-coins:  MasterCoin and Nxt.

Two people have bitcoin in a 40-person office.  So your adoption number is currently 5%.  Your information number is 100%, so everyone is thinking about it.


It doesn't seem like it.  There's too much coming that will make sense for people to use Bitcoin:  serious investment vehicles, gambling, low conversion fees for tourism, porn that your SO won't know about, sending money on the cheap, secure online purchasing... on and on.

It does.  And that's interesting.  The wallet looks quite convenient as well.
However, I'd never touch it.
Firstly, It requires Google Chrome - and I stay as far away from Google as possible.
And secondly, while the encryption of the messaging part has reached new heights of simplicity and convenience (especially for GPG), the metadata of each message is out in the open.  Nope.
I'm not a major security nut:  but Google + metadata is just more than I care to give away of the bulk of the important (to me) stuff I do on the internet.

That was put there by Satoshi.  It is the below-the-fold headline of The Times for that date.
One thing it does is prove that there was no pre-mining, as foreknowledge of that headline is obviously impossible - and since all mined blocks were verifiably mined after the Genesis block, pre-mining didn't happen.  It also means that everyone on earth had an equal, fair shot at mining from the very beginning:  check the release time of the original client *vs.* the first mined block.

An overdraft is just an overdraft - it doesn't matter how much it's for.  Your bank just bounces the charge and dings you for whatever the fee is - and Coinbase notifies you that you've been a bad boy (I don't know if they charge you also, or not).  Or your bank *pays* the charge, but still dings your account for their fee.  As far as how much your bank will pay beyond what you have in your account, that's up to them - and you probably got information about that when you opened your account.

You are so totally full of shit.  You lie about what's in front of your face, just for the pain you can cause to the world.


52.8% of the survey respondents have been into Bitcoin for a year or more.


47.2% believe Bitcoin will be worth $2,500 or less in the next year.  That is *quite* conservative when compared to the year-on-year performance of Btcoin since its beginning.


Exactly 50% of the respondents own Bitcoin valued at $2.800 or more.  Given the age distribution of the respondents, and comparing the normalized investment portfolio of that cohort in all other, more typical investments; Bitcoin investors are doing *much* better than average.  Much.


44.4% have read the paper **in its entirety**.  Of the remainder, it isn't noted how many have read *some* of it, or none.  *Bothering* to read that paper will not be successful in all cases, due to understanding the thing - but understanding Bitcoin is not dependent on understanding the white paper.


Exactly 50% state that they've "purchased goods or services" with Bitcoin.  By your use of the word "most", *most* **have** spent coins.
In short, while I have no problem at all with skeptics who are honest human beings, and present what doubts about Bitcoin they may have in a forthright, non-manipulative fashion...

I've been pro-legalization for half a *century*, and my first thought on this new policy by DOJ is that it certainly does get all available banking (and therefore general) information on weed dealers, users, and ancillary businesses into one, easy to keep track of database.
Doesn't it?  And, courtesy of the banks, for free.
Understand that it isn't about who uses or deals in weed.  If it's legal, that's not really an issue.  But transition periods are... interesting.  And really, what all that information is, is a database of people who are willing to flaunt the law for political and/or financial reasons.  Because they didn't just crawl out of the woodwork once these new laws were implemented:  that's how they were *before*, right?

The major schism that's happening right now - between anonymizers like DarkWallet, and people like the Ripple and/or CoinValidation crowd - are what will drive the core of Bitcoin for the next year or so.  And if there isn't some kind of accommodation made for privacy and anonymity - at the same level as that provided by fiat cash - there will be monumental fork of a size and importance that could very easily destroy Bitcoin.

IANAL... but I am in my seventh decade and have some experience with the IRS.
 - you file as you are advised by a tax professional who you pay, and who signs your forms as the preparer: until such time as Bitcoin is mainstream, and a simple part of every tax form and tax software package.
 - The most important thing is just to file.  The IRS will almost always forgive even bad mistakes; but they will seldom forgive bad intent.

Actually, given a twenty year sub-career in tech, I've tested the use cases for just about damn near everything.
You missed the key to my post - I'm in my 60s.  And the screen, as I said, is too damn small.  You'll find out - trust me.  ;-)
But even without that, I still can't find a good reason to use a smartwatch.  If I could, I wouldn't mind using my glasses.  Bluetooth is a huge security hole, and phones are bad enough in that regard.  The only way to watch stored video is to re-encode for the screen size - which is still a project in itself - and you can't even come close to counting on streamed video to be encoded correctly for that screen format.
You can't use a smartwatch as a phone extension, except in speakerphone mode.  In public that's kind of rude and not terribly private - and in private it's pointless.
You can't type on a smartwatch.  So no texting or email or blogging without taking out your phone anyway.
You're not protecting the $400-800 investment in your phone by keeping it in your pocket and using the smartwatch - because the smartwatch is *much* more exposed to damage; hanging out on the single most mobile part of your body, that takes hits every day all day long.  And while it *is* cheaper than your phone, it's not *that* much cheaper.
So tell me - what can you do with a smartwatch that's better or easier?  I honestly can't think of a thing.

You can, actually - it depends on how you implement Bitcoin on your donation page.  It isn't impossible, "...due to the nature of bitcoin..."  For some types of donations (like those to US political candidates under some circumstances) it is a legal requirement to have information similar to AML/KYC for every donator.  That's pretty easy to do, with name/address information attached to individually generated Bitcoin addresses:  no different than a standard over-the-internet donation via credit card.

Some employers do pay in Bitcoin, by request.  BitPay, Coinbase, &amp; etc. - employers in the Bitcoin space in general.  And dealing with withholding stuff is standard - and simple, at this point.
But it's not that tough to set up for any employer, actually.  Coinbase will set up an automatic weekly/biweekly/etc. Bitcoin buy for you, taken directly from your bank *via* ACH.  It just takes a couple of minutes to set up if you already have a verified account with them.  So just use the bank account you use for Coinbase with your employer (with direct payroll deposit, of course), and do your fiat banking with a different account.

Payment processors expose companies to the value of Bitcoin.  They know what percentage of their sales are generated from Bitcoin, even though what they're receiving is fiat.
That's usually good for Bitcoin, long-term.  But - oddly enough - *not* good for the business of payment processing.  It's almost as though the processors are tasked with putting themselves out of business:  the more clients they get that are successful, the more consider accepting Bitcoin by themselves.  Tough business...

Nice rebuttal.  Quite politic.  I could never have gotten through something like this without remarking on Krugman's wild and hilariously wrong predictions about the internet, way back when.
Alas, Krugman has unfortunately become a somewhat ossified dinosaur - and that at a couple of years younger than I am.  He will never change his mind, and will no doubt go to his grave explaining why Bitcoin couldn't possibly work.  He reminds me of the paleontologists who died denying the possibility of humans existing in North America further back than 10k years...
It's a shame.  As a classical economist Krugman is quite amazing - agree with him or not.  But that's frequently what happens when a pulpit like the New York Times is handed to you.  Hubris.

No.  Bitcoin is useful for any number of things - lots of which we haven't even figured out yet.  But mortgages aren't one of them.
Somebody gets screwed.  Always.
If I lend 100 BTC at 4% and take a monthly payment over 15 years, what happens?  Either:
a.) the loan is denominated in fiat:  so I loan out $70k (at today's exchange rate) and receive the BTC-equivalent of about $525/month.  I lose the total potential upside exchange rate of my original Bitcoin - for 15 years.  Or:
b.) the loan is denominated purely in Bitcoin.  In that case, if Bitcoin goes up the borrower is screwed - if it goes down, I'm screwed.
And really, since the only thing that's absolutely certain about Bitcoin is that the price will fluctuate, *somebody* is going to get screwed.

On the other hand, *reputation based* selling is pretty much fraud free, and has been for as long as there've been dealers on the internet, and mail-order dealers as well.  So... a long time.

There aren't too many minable alt-coins that are useful in themselves.  Namecoin has a distinct purpose, for example.  Whichever alt-coin implements a real anonymity structure will have distinct value as well:  trading in and out of Bitcoin to launder coins effectively.

Well, you aren't going to have anything but problems with banks - everything I've read about legal cannabis and banks indicates that.  The banks won't touch pot, basically.

Never mind all the political stuff - just sell the security side of it.

Reverse payment processing is an idea that goes back to at least early 2011.
The problem is the supply chain.  Until a merchant doesn't need fiat to pay off his suppliers, it won't happen broadly.  But even now - almost exclusively in tech - there are complete Bitcoin supply chains.  Roger Ver's was the first, I believe.

In fairness, this could happen to any Point-of-Sale Bitcoin system as well.  As near as I can make out, this is a network issue involving the inability of merchants to connect and verify account balances.  It is not a back-end, database (which would correspond to Bitcoin's blockchain) issue.
I'm not going to fault the credit card system here.  In point of fact, when the network is down it works better than Bitcoin:  as far as I know, there isn't any Bitcoin analog to a manual credit card swiper (the 'crash kit' that retailers keep handy, just in case...).

I'm sorry - this seems so... artificial.  You had a timer ticking.  There's little room for doubt that Coinbase's wallet isn't the most timely or efficient:  we hear that frequently.  You had BTC in your own wallet ("so I send some bitcoins from my personal wallet. This transaction goes through immediately.") but you still screwed around with all this other stuff.
All you had to do was send Gyft the BTC out of your wallet and make the pot right later.  At your convenience.  In a leisurely fashion.
I'm sorry.  Really.  But this looks to be pretty much a series of bad decisions on your part, and problems of your own devising.  It was a simple transaction - why bring all the different players into it that you did?
Again - I'm sorry.  I don't mean to sound like a scold or something - but honestly, a little forethought?

Excuse me - there is rather a large difference between *security* - and getting endless do-overs, paid for by everyone else (which is how you get stolen money back, if you didn't know...) to compensate for your own carelessness.

OK... step away from the computer.  Go over to your refrigerator and get a beer.  Sit on the couch for awhile.  Let the complexity drain from you...
You're making this *way* too difficult.


Just give each of your friends a receiving address from your Bitcoin wallet - not your Coinbase account.  That's all it takes.  Then when you get the bitcoin you send it where you like - to buy stuff or sell it for fiat money.
If you use one receiving address for each friend, you will always know who has sent what to you.  Don't give them your exchange addresses - that will just make everything more complicated, and it wouldn't really be any faster.

It's roughly 2140 that all coins will be mined, actually.
But the point where Bitcoin becomes deflationary is considerably before that - and it is unlikely we will know exactly when that will be.
The deflationary point is reached when the number of coins remaining to be mined is precisely equal to the number of coins that have been irretrievably lost (to intentional black-holing, lost private keys and passwords, or mistaken sends to valid but un-owned addresses).

In case 1, the bitcoins show up when the receiver comes online.
In case 2, there are two possibilities:  either you try to send to a wallet address that *looks* properly formed, but isn't - in which case the client you're sending from will notify you that it didn't work.
**Or** you have the misfortune to send to a wallet address that is properly formed, but not the one you wanted to send to.  In that case you're pretty much screwed - your bitcoins are gone.
So basically, when sending bitcoin **NEVER** hand-type the receiving address.  **Always** cut-and-paste, or use a QR code.
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:51:55


You give a little thought to the position that leaves you in.  Spending that quantity will incur a transaction fee that is disproportionately large:  in fact, many wallets and/or websites won't even allow it.
...and then you give a little thought to the position you're putting the people you're dealing with in.
Coinbase, for example, pays the fee for its customers.  In their case, you're asking them to pay more - probably *much* more - than the miniscule profit they will make on a $5.00 purchase.
Bitcoin is **not** for the wealthy - in fact it's more for the 'regular' folks.  But still, everything has its limits:  at *both* ends.

*There is absolutely nothing wrong with numbers.*  It's really all that makes sense.  0.01, 0.001, etc.  There won't ever be any difficulty - no problems in translating into different languages, no rembering silly made-up symbols and getting custom keyboard templates for them, no possibility - **ever** - of making a one or two or three decimal point error.
Just numbers.  We've been given an amazingly simple thing by Satoshi - simple in concept and in understanding - after one gets past the complexity of the software design, which really isn't important to the majority of users.  Let's not screw it up.

Nothing.  But it has a purpose, as most of these kinds of articles do:  *Normalization*.
1.  	to bring or make into the normal state
2.  	*to bring into conformity with a standard*
The more people hear about regulation of any kind, the more acceptable the idea becomes.  It looks like it's just background buzz, but it works its way into the subconscious, and slowly changes perception.

Wood.  Exotic woods, to be precise.  The highest-end cabinet grade.
As climate change destroys the habitat of the exotic woods, and deforestation (especially in South America and the far east) destroys the old growth without replacement, it's become a pretty good investment:  20-30%/year for the past three or four decades.  [EDIT:  Well, not *every* year.  But better steady appreciation than anything else I can think of.]
The main drawback is proper storage.  You need to be somewhere that's naturally good for storage - artificial environmental controls are too expensive to make a long term profit.  And it is definitely a long term play.  Tough to sell, too:  you have to spend some time and effort getting into the community.

How could you have learned enough about mining to set it up correctly; but totally missed that Nvidia cards aren't any good at it at all, and that GPU and CPU mining (CPU?  Really?) are as dead as it gets?
No offense - but a ASIC Block Erupter can be purchased for $10 on a good day, costs about 2.5W to run, and hashes at 330Mh/sec.  Your Nvidia card gets 6-7 Mh/sec, burns 40-50W to run, and cost you $3-400 USD.
And over a period of one year, running 24/7, you won't mine enough coin to pay for one day's worth of electricity.

But there's quite a big difference - when considering bitcoin adoption - between 'functionally spending' bitcoin, and spending them directly.
I'm **much** more concerned with overall adoption than I am with just turning bitcoin into purchased goods however I can.  We've had various translation services available to us since 2011 - but they don't help with adoption, they don't show how inexpensive bitcoin can be for a retailer, and they don't show up on the news or on the financial blogs as *bitcoin sales*.  They're just some translation company taking your bitcoin and passing it on to a retailer as fiat, for a fee.  It's somewhat helpful, I suppose - but not tremendously.  And **certainly** not as helpful as getting an endpoint retailer to accept bitcoin directly.

The .com site has a pretty impossible business model though.  You might have to wait until they go out of business and sell the .com to somebody with a bit more common sense.  Selling bitcoin for a reversible payment like credit cards is just not ever likely to work, no matter how careful you are.

Not as well distributed as you believe, I don't think.  Satoshi, ArtForz, Vlad - that's pushing three million right there, I think.
I'd suggest going back and reading the first year of the bitcointalk forum.  There's people who haven't been heard from in two or three years (at least under their original UIDs), who 'fessed up to some pretty big numbers back then, when a coin was worth a nickel - and then disappeared once they decided to get down into the weeds.
And there's some later, second-wave (post June '11) adopters who were players before they got into bitcoin - and bought massive amounts at $2-5: cypherdoc, miscreanity, Goat, and a few others.
I suspect that the *other* half of the 11.7 million coin out there is probably as well-distributed as you think.  But there's some seriously big fish in the water.

Tracking numbers typically take 24 hours to get into the system.  So, while a sender can give you the number because they get it as soon as they print a shipping label, it won't show up in UPS's logs (or on their tracking web page) until it has replicated through all of their databases.
BFL may be using 'mark as shipped' to take orders out of their system.  It's the lazy way to do things - so that fits...

This is true.  But if you have customers using Android devices anyway, have them install Bridgewalker.  It only takes 60 seconds.  Just post a sign:  "Please use Bridgewalker for bitcoin transactions."  ...with a QR link.
It's pretty easy to explain to folks that - unlike with a blockchain-based wallet - they can't lose USD value if bitcoin goes down, since storage on Bridgewalker is denominated in USD.  People get that right away.

No.  It might be raised above 1MB.
What you're missing is the assumption that adoption will continue to increase.  Which doesn't appear to be unwarranted.  If this is the case, then people will be jostling for their transactions to be placed quickly, and the only way to get that is with fees.

That one quote clearly demonstrates that you haven't done the most elementary research.  That may be why "...it got buried."
Try this (stickied on the front page of the subreddit):
Then try the FAQ, Common Myths and Getting Started stuff on the right sidebar.
...and come back when you understand that bitcoin has no debt to equity ratio, no expenses, no gross revenue, no profit and loss statements and no revenue projections.
Then try the search function on the right:  for "bitcoin ATM", and whatever else interests you.  That's what it's for.
Sorry - but really, that was an insulting post.

SSD because downloading the blockchain in the client is pretty slow with a 'spinner'.  And it helps the rest of OS and installed software, if that's important to you - that is, if you're using the computer for anything else.
And I wouldn't install Ubuntu anything - they're just too cavalier about user privacy.  The Mint Debian spin is what I've used in the past.
As for Electrum, it's a good wallet - solid and well done.  I've used it for small amounts of coin.  But the truth is, I'm just more comfortable with the Qt reference client.  YMMV.

But it isn't.  Right now, everyone contributes a little bit of their taxes for the USDA to serve us all.  And even those who don't pay income or asset taxes still pay something in sales taxes.
It certainly isn't a perfect system - but everyone has access to clean, edible food.  And that's important.  It's called civilization.
As far as the system is concerned, bitcoin may have some input there.  If cryptocurrencies are successful, those governments that don't already do so may find themselves in a position where they have no choice but to switch over to a VAT of some sort.  That would be a better structure than we have in the US, for all of me.

The process really involves hiring a tax guy.  A tax lawyer, if the money involved is biggish.
I paid a long-term capital gains hit last year.  This year I have no income (just more-or-less retired), so theoretically I won't owe capital gains on what I cashed out, as 0 income = bottom tax bracket.
That's Fed.  State is different for every state.
But don't listen to me.  Don't listen to anybody else either - unless you're paying them and they're on the hook as your preparer.

I sell high-dollar antiquities for bitcoin *only*, on my own, invitation-only website.  I'm an established dealer, with over forty years of reputation behind me.
I price my items in USD, because I'm generally competing with dealers who sell in USD - and then I knock off a straight percentage for my savings on credit card charges, fraud, &amp; etc.  And my site automagically adjusts every ten minutes for the exchange rate fluctuation.  I don't use a payment processor to instantly convert to fiat - so in times of very high rate fluctuation I just shut down the shopping cart with an explanation - no complaints on that.

One thing I've noticed with Fox - both nationally *and* locally - is that the longer an individual newscaster is with the network, the sloppier they get.
~~Mike~~ Chris Wallace (may his dad rest in ignorance) is an almost perfect example.
I suspect they just give up.  They make pretty good comparative money.  They get used to that.  But pretty soon they come to understand that they're toxic, for any other news organization.  There's a fair amount of news people who move *into* the Fox organization - but very few who manage to get *out*.
That's also been historically true of reporters who have spent time working for any of the supermarket tabloids.
You'd think they'd learn.

The polling numbers on this issue at bitcointalk disagree with that assessment.
On the matter of CoinValidation, 90% are opposed to putting it into bitcoin.
And on the question of taint the numbers are similar - with 75% calling for Mike Hearn's resignation from the Foundation.

Also, you'll go broke paying the fees for every transaction.

I think you've got a moderate case of confirmation bias going on.  There have *always* been investments like bitcoin, and the things people have said about them have always been pretty much the same.
I'm in my 60s... I remember my father telling me about his greatest investment mistake:  his mother (my grandmother) had told him to put everything he could scrape together into Tampax stock.  He didn't.  And I've missed a few good ones in my life, too - like the deals that were offered on CDs, back when interest rates were *paying* well over 17%.  A guaranteed million for a couple thousand over whatever time period the future value worked out to:  25 years?  And Microsoft... I missed that too.
We've **all** made these mistakes.  We've all passed on stuff we shouldn't have passed on.  But eventually - some of us sooner than others - we put it together and catch just one good one.  We figure out the inherent sameness of the really good ones that come out of left field (Tampax?  Really?) and something speaks to us the next time one comes along - like bitcoin spoke to me.
So seriously - skip the exceptionalism.  Stand back a little more and look at the world with a bit wider gaze.  Plenty of folks will miss this boat; but plenty will catch it.
Same ol' same ol'.

Mining guilds don't have minds, and have no incentives.  *People* have incentives.
People who mine in pools (is that what you meant by 'mining guilds'?)  have many incentives and many motives.
Mining at a loss can be easily justified by looking at the exchange rate increase:  if you're losing money mining at $200/BTC, you'll show a good profit if you hold your mined coin until the rate is $300/BTC.  It's a gamble, of course - but so far it works out.

I'm arguing no such thing, and I defy you to construct a rational argument showing that I have, from anything I've posted - here or elsewhere.  Spare me your wish fulfillment.
What I argue is essentially what you do - except maybe, in my advanced decrepitude at the age of 62 - I see it more clearly and with the simplicity of a real, historical truth.
You say that Walmart, *et alia*, are efficient - and I agree, up to the point where they leave the poorest of us behind.  But that's almost irrelevant compared to **why** they are efficient.  Have you ever given that much thought?  And you will say that they are efficient because of economies of scale...
And I will agree with you and defend you to the end.
But you're not thinking it through.  Those same economies of scale are **exactly** why the taxation that is applied to the USDA is more efficient than anything which humans have yet devised to live together in a nation not at war with itself (although there are those who obviously would prefer that war - are you one of them?).  We are all made safe by so little, compared to what we might spend otherwise... and it is *all* of us, not those wealthy few that you probably don't belong to anyway.

Agreed.  And really - to see how it is likely to go, you have only to look at the adoption statistics for Skype, from long ago.
On a practical level, bitcoin is just Skype for money... cheaper, without time constraints, more secure, etc.  And it is always displaced/expat populations that adopt these things first (*user* adoption - not investor/early adoption).
I *would* like to see the browsing numbers for Portuguese-speakers as well.  Brazil's inflation rate is only about 6-7% - but their currency controls, while not as draconian as in Argentina, make for the potential of bitcoin adoption.  Well over half the population of South America is Brazilian - it wouldn't do to ignore them...

So basically, what we need - in addition to an anonymizer like Zerocoin - is a **concatenator**.
That is, an overlay to bitcoin that will take a thousand tiny inputs of dust, and turn them into a single, homogenous, and no-longer-particulate sum of bitcoin.
Because really - where does the intrusion of blacklisters (and, by extension, governments) end?  If you get 30 BTC from somebody and there's a 0.0004 input in the transaction that's on somebody's blacklist, is the whole transaction bad?  Or does some higher power just take the 0.0004 BTC away from you?
And who decides?
Yeah - a concatenator.  Is that possible?

All good advice (always assuming that what the OP means by "a large sum" is what you or I mean by that...).
But this:


...is really one of the great lacks in the bitcoin protocol.  We need some kind of 'dead man's switch' built in.  A completely unattended, un-trusting way to pass our bitcoins on, in the event of our unanticipated demise.  No *m of n*, no group of trusted people - just another kind of specialized transaction:  *if I don't input a key every month, sent this many ( x ) of my bitcoins to this address, and the rest to that address*.
We seriously need that.  DPR would've loved it... ;-)

To get on a show like Stossel's, Brito would have to agree to certain areas of restriction, and also agree to stick with the things Stossel wanted to discuss, in the order he wanted to discuss them, and with the weight of importance given to those things according to how Stossel wanted to apply that weight.
And those same restrictions apply to Stossel - more generally - in his relationship with Fox.
So let's be realistic.  Brito did fine.

Sorry - that's ridiculous.
The odds of a lottery paying off a decent amount are tens of millions to one - **against**.
The odds of bitcoin succeeding are maybe somewhat less than a toss-up, but probably a bit better.
And while the odds of the parent's prediction ("If Bitcoin realises its full potential you'll have the purchasing power of today's 150k USD.") are admittedly low - they're nowhere near as bad as a lottery ticket.  10k to one, maybe?
And of course, while a lottery ticket is a strictly win-or-lose proposition, with bitcoin - even if you don't win big - you will likely still win.

eBay has PayPal.  Why would they kill that golden egg-laying goose?
eBay hates sellers.  For some odd reason, they go out of their way to screw the people they get their money from - and they don't get a dime from buyers.  Why would they change that, and offer a non-reversible payment system?
Nah.  I ain't buying it.  If eBay is looking at it, they will only look for as long as it takes to determine that they won't be able to turn it into the same kind of reversible bullshit they've already got.

Some little punk without two nickels to rub together might entertain the idea - but as soon as he got the dough to make a difference he'd change his tune pretty quickly.

It isn't bitcoin that needs to be saved - what needs to be saved is any cryptocurrency, the infrastructure surrounding it, and how we deal with those things to our advantage.  *Saved*, in the sense that we need to get this right.
The reason that we should be focusing on bitcoin is because it's here.  It exists now.  And if we let it go we'll just have to do it all over again with the next coin.  But it will be harder, the second (or third or fourth) time around:  the powers arrayed against us will be stronger and will have had practice.  We will be weaker for having already lost once.
So no:  bitcoin does not deserve to fail under any circumstances I can imagine.  It just deserves better defenders.

The Megacoin dev invented the Gravity Well:  a way to stop pool hoppers from taking advantage.  It's a relatively small thing, but has already been adopted by other alt-coins.
At least two alt-coins are working hard at getting some kind of serious anonymity (Zerocoin, CoinJoin, or?) into their coins:  Megacoin and Anoncoin.
Haven't had a chance to research a couple others that are supposed to be doing new, good stuff.  But the world of alt-coins is not entirely filled with pump'n'dump scamcoins.  Close - but not entirely.

When the chairs face out, even if you're talking to someone sitting in them their attention is divided by the hubbub of the rest of the convention.  This is a sales situation - and a situation designed to implant a specific, positive memory:  divided attention is bad.
When the chairs are at the perimeter of the booth - and facing *in* - you have captured the attention of your potential sale.  You can use that huge signboard usefully - as a whiteboard or another screen or perhaps as a device to game out scenarios - rather than a static attention-getter that only leads to a letdown when it doesn't do anything else.
I'd put the table at the edge of the aisle with chairs inside facing in, and the food on the table.  Leave the screen where it is - but on a purpose-built pedestal with shallow shelving and some kind of screen to isolate my booth from the one next to it on that side, within the convention rules (which will usually prohibit screening higher than 3 - 4 feet... but LCD Monitors can be quite large).
And so on.  It looks like an 8 foot space, but you can really do a lot more with that than they're doing.

Except in the case where the Buyer claims he lost his card/it was stolen/somebody got his password, etc.  And for a 'free' few thousand dollars there are plenty of fraudulent Buyers who will go through the hassle of lost card replacement.
I've been dealing with eBay, and then PayPal, for almost 15 years now - and they will very seldom take a Seller's side over that of a Buyer.
There's just going to have to be some kind of verification process that's better than what they're using now, or I don't think it's going to work.  Don't get me wrong - I *really want* for it to work.  But I'll be sitting it out until I see something pretty bulletproof.

No offense, but I don't think you quite get how difficulty adjusts, and how miners adjust to that adjustment.
The endpoint of difficulty is an ROI similar to any other business.  Miners (of which I was one for quite awhile) will always ride the edge of profitability.  And there will be no "collapse of processing power": only adjustment.
If a miner "foresee[s] huge losses", he has two choices:  turn off his miners and wait for a better ROI environment, or sell his equipment at a loss to somebody who will - therefore - have less invested in equipment and a proportionally better ROI.  It ain't rocket science.
And why does an internal matter like mining profitability - which has **zero** reflection in the conduct of bitcoin businesses, and bitcoin adoption in general - have *anything at all* to do with bitcoin's reputation?  I mean, thank you for your concern - but it's just not relevant.

I load it up at home on my network, usually (although I can load it at stores that have Wi-Fi) - take it to the store and it works great.
It's a great way to re-purpose old tech, and there's nothing on the phone but Gyft - so whatever permissions they want don't matter.

It will happen.  But probably not until the block reward drops another couple of notches - down to 6.25.  Although maybe only by 12.5.
The plain fact is, miners keep the spice flowing - the network will die without them and if they can't earn a living then Bitcoin will fail.  And if you think whatever price they set as a transaction fee is unfair, there won't be much to do about it.
Agreements between the pools are inevitable - the laws that prevent that sort of thing (price fixing, etc.) between normal, legally constituted corporations don't apply to Bitcoin, as far as I'm aware.  And I'd be willing to bet that we'll never see a pool incorporated and trading on Wall Street.

We agree.  There are technical reasons why this is difficult - but hopefully it'll get resolved.
As for the security of your Qt wallet, as long as it's encrypted it should be safe.  I'd use Qt to back it up, and also copy the raw wallet.dat file; put 'em both in a TrueCrypt container on a USB drive, an M-Disk, and mail it to a couple email addresses.  It's not that much money, so I'd imagine those precautions should be sufficient.

So - basically - a buyer pays with a CC and you send bitcoin to the seller?  *And* some to the buyer?
You are going to lose your shirt on chargebacks.
My suspicion is that you'll wind up with buyer/seller fraud teams who charge stuff, and charge back purchases.  The buyer will get the kickback bitcoin, the seller will get the bitcoin.  After a couple of months of many transactions with many different fake buyers with a few fake sellers they'll all file chargebacks for one reason or another - and you'll be holding the bag.
No offense, but that's how it goes...

You should look into how Dwolla was responsible for shutting Tradehill (their first iteration) down.  They promised no chargebacks and then went into Tradehill's bank and took huge amounts of money (enough to force bankruptcy) to cover *their* chargebacks:  and all without informing Tradehill.
The lawsuit is ongoing.  Nobody who's been around bitcoin for more than a couple years will touch Dwolla - with good reason.

I neither said nor implied that you were disagreeing.  You asked, I answered.
I was unclear about banks, I guess.  Yes... they need to be cut out - that is, insulated - from having anything to do with bitcoin.  But they are still where we keep our fiat money, and fiat is important.  So the act of putting money into a bank account needs to be more individualized.  Exchanges can be good - especially for large transactions - but I personally think that P2P needs to happen at the 'small transaction' level; if only as a matter of privacy.

I've always followed procedure - and what you're saying doesn't jibe at all with what my experience has been (or that of almost all the long-term sellers I know).    Note:  it isn't all *"Oh I never got it"* fraud - just a convenient example.  There's "unauthorized charges", of course - and many other scams.  But I've tracked every package I ever sent, and gotten signatures for anything over fifty bucks or so (depending on how I felt about any given deal).  Doesn't matter.  My longevity?  Doesn't matter.

@_date: 2013-09-05 12:16:55


On the one hand this is true.  Keep in mind that eBay doesn't pay those chargebacks though:  sellers do.
But on the other - remember... if eBay figures out some way to integrate bitcoin, they will also make it so that chargebacks will be just as possible as they are now with PayPal.  An escrow method for achieving that is pointed out in the bitcointalk link to **Nightowlace's** past comments.
For me - as a long time eBay seller - I doubt this will change anything much.  I will still refuse to sell things worth over a couple of hundred bucks on eBay.  The chargeback fraud is too heavy, and eBay doesn't give a shit about sellers:  who, oddly enough, are their only source of user income.
So I guess my take on it is that if eBay starts up with bitcoin, yeah, that is a really incredibly good thing for bitcoin.  But probably without much value to eBay sellers.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:59:23
I would recommend doing that research when the price isn't particularly tradable, so you don't scramble and make mistakes when it is.  Right now it appears we may be headed back up from a low of [Gox] $415, so it's likely your time has passed.

I don't really consider this to be a reliable indicator - neither trailing or leading.
The problem is that the farther along the adoption curve we go, the more people have already heard of bitcoin - and so they have no need to Google it.  At first glance it would almost appear to be an inverse function:  as price goes up, the validity of Google searches goes down.
I suppose there's some way to accurately correct for that - but I don't know it.  Maybe somebody who does will weigh in...

That is not true.  There are NO wallet apps allowed in the App Store.  There are a couple of wrappers, but no wallets.

Actually, I think it's accurate.  The FBI wants to launder their coins so they don't show up easily in the blockchain as belonging to them.

@_date: 2013-10-11 21:53:51
Maybe.  I can't say I know with any certainty.
The thing is this:  anyone who knows enough about bitcoin to understand it has value, is probably not going to be able to avoid the knowledge that the stuff can't be stolen in a normal way.  Everyone encrypts their wallets and/or mobile devices in some way.  So really, the only way to steal their bitcoin is by essentially kidnapping and torturing them.  People who are capable of understanding the value of bitcoin will also understand that this is a whole different level of crime - and punishment - than a regular mugging.
I think what I'm trying to say is that anything having to do with bitcoin probably requires more smarts than the average mugger can muster.
I dunno - just thinking out loud.  I suppose we'll find out eventually.

I predict that in 2014 we will see a trebling of the paid trolls which frequent the larger Bitcoin forums.
I predict that just one bank, somewhere in the world, will announce its acceptance of and desire for Bitcoin business - and will be able to maintain that position in the face of opposition by major players in the banking community.
I predict that at least five more tickets aboard the Virgin Galactic sub-orbital excursion will sell for Bitcoin.
I predict that *at least* one of the major antiquity/art (my field...) auction houses will accept Bitcoin directly for their auctions:  possibly either Sotheby's or Christie's; with settlement at the hammer.
I predict that a heretofore comparatively worthless alt-coin will surpass the market cap of Litecoin, with the successful implementation of real - and easy to use - anonymity into its protocol.
I predict that some UN-member country will jail one of its citizens, for the act of simply using Bitcoin.

Even if these estimates are even remotely accurate (let's keep in mind that the government routinely 'estimates' the value of multi-ton pot busts by multiplying the per gram street price of weed times the number of grams in a ton...), has any company in history ever held every dime they've made for their first years of operation?

You'll need someone you trust who knows about bitcoin.
Look around for posties, etc., with things written on them that could be passwords.  Under keyboards, under desks or desk drawers - all the usual places.
There might be files on the computers that have passwords in them.  Probably are.
The password manager of his web browser is likely very valuable - all the password protected sites he used might be listed there.  And even if the user names and passwords are encrypted by the browser, that encryption is weak, and can be cracked.

On the other hand, once we hit $1000, shit gets real.  There's some serious Western money looking at that number, waiting to climb aboard.
But frankly, I think estimates of people selling out at some/any psychologically magic number are overblown.
What's $1000 in renminbi?  I'm not going to bother finding out - however, I know it's a completely random number to those of us in the West.  **But** it's the Chinese who are driving this market right now.
So what happens when bitcoin hits 10,000 Renminbi?  Or 1,000 pounds?  Or 1,000 Euro...?

You're missing the point.
Linking credit cards (and other identity proofs) to your Coinbase account is about AML/KYC stuff - not delivery time.
And I've been buying and selling on Coinbase since they opened, and this:


...is completely untrue given every experience I've had with them - or heard about from reliable sources - and verging on the scurrilous.  It's 98% done in a database - nobody is cheating you or screwing you over because somebody else has more money than you do.  There isn't a deal you've done with them that a human has even looked at, unless you got flagged by their software (which you obviously didn't).

It's possible they're jumping the queue and shipping, to stop a chargeback from happening.
I guess what I'd do is push ahead with the chargeback if I got the units and return them, since the ROI on them is in the negative at this point.
But it might take me six months or so to actually get them shipped back... ;-)

And I'm talking about speed.  I thought that was your concern.
Coinbase isn't fast.  It never will be, it doesn't need to be, and there's no reason for them to try to be.  Part of the reason they're slow to put coins out into the blockchain is their security precautions.  Have you read about them?  They hardly keep any hot wallet at all - everything is split up all over the world, &amp; etc.  It all takes time - but it's *very* safe.
It doesn't sound like you have much patience.  Coinbase may not be for you.  That's all I'm saying.

@_date: 2013-09-13 17:42:27
I've been dealing in my market for a long time.  Decades.  I have no difficulty with buyer trust - my reputation is solid.
My volume on high-buck stuff is pretty much whatever I want it to be.  I sell for bitcoin a bit below market - as incentive, and as compensation for exchange fees - and I've spent days, on occasion, walking a customer through getting bitcoin to pay me with.  Before bitcoin I sold my better stuff for bank wire - split charges - and my longer-term customers appreciate the savings.

For the love of God:  "affect".
With an "a" - not an "e".
Full stop.
Beyond that:  no.  ~~Transfer fees~~ *transaction* fees keep miners mining, whatever they might be.  And as the exchange rate increases the fees go down - but not beyond the point where the crossover between block reward and fees makes it economically non-viable to mine...
...because mining is the only thing that keeps bitcoin alive.
But other than that, there is no relationship between the exchange rate for bitcoin and the transaction fees.  Blocksize discussions currently underway have *much* more of an impact.
Your bitcoin vocabulary - at the least - indicates that you have more research to do.  I'd suggest the Project Development and Technical subforums at bitcointalk.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:50:22
Learn by doing then.  Coinbase is good, reliable, and relatively inexpensive.  Buy a bitcoin or two the next time you need to buy some geek stuff - and spend it at bitcoinsuperstore.  It's as cheap as Amazon.  See how websites that take bitcoin work.  Decide whether you want to accept bitcoin as bitcoin, or have a processor like Coinbase or bitpay put fiat into your account.
Pretty much any way you'd like to go about it exists.  But deciding *how* to go about it is up to you.

I think what I'm saying revolves around this:


We agree, for example, on your first two sentences:  Facebook was a stupid investment.
However, I think you're mistaken in your clearly expressed belief ("It appears THESE are the only people who made it in at the right time.") that the train has left the station.  It hasn't - and that's pretty obvious.  Just in the past month, an investment in bitcoin doubled.  It may not rise as fast in the future, or it may rise faster; and the ride will certainly be bumpy.  But I think it's still likely to be the best investment of 2014, as it has been for each of the past three years.  YMMV.
And frankly, your belief that people here are over the top in their support of all things bitcoin (pretty much the entire thrust of the last three paragraphs of your OP) is illogical.  It's Of *course* people are maximally pumped.  You don't see as much good in bitcoin as most folks here do, and so you take that to prove their confidence is in error.  But there's plenty of places where people aren't that pumped though - which is why I thought you might want to stand back a bit more.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:41:46
Yes.  We're in for an unpleasant fork at some point, I do believe.
The Bitcoin Foundation was an idea with some beneficial potential, horribly executed.

The Foundation is all nanny-staters, all authoritarians, all (apparently) compromised by their own greed at the least.

@_date: 2013-09-13 17:53:45
I am not saying fraud only works in one direction.  Where did I say, or imply that?
But in the case of sellers like me - with a long-term history in a specific field - the seller fraud is pretty much non-existent.  Nobody with a decades-long reputation is going to rip off a buyer, other than by dying at an inconvenient point during the course of a deal (which admittedly does happen...).
My argument is specific to my case, and is not even slightly dubious.

And living in Hawaii with a stripper for a girlfriend, he had a huge monthly nut to crack.  $100k/yr is **not** an amazing job - especially in a hugely expensive place like Hawaii:  it's at the low end of middle class.


His preparations were related to security, not money.  He couldn't leave the country with more than $10k cash - even if the risk of getting caught was small, in his situation to do so would have been madness.
His bank accounts were blocked immediately, of course - assuming he had much in them.


Why?  Why do you assume that?  When he was first stuck in the airport terminal in Russia, he couldn't really afford a room at the airport hotel - I remember reading about him looking at the price schedule and shrugging.  His Hong Kong hotel wasn't any more than a cracker-barrel tourist stopover:  a people box.
Right now, Snowden has $16k in USD donations, about $12k in BTC donations, and the donated services of some pretty competent lawyers and others of that ilk.
He **does not** have plenty of money.  His family **is not** even remotely wealthy.  He's entertaining job offers, last I heard.

If all the coins were mined in a single year, what would be the incentive for miners to continue mining?  After one year the bitcoin exchange rate was less than a nickel - mining for transaction fees alone would have made zero sense.  So nobody would have done it.
Which brings into play that mining is what protects the network and enables transactions.  So there needs to be a strong incentive to mine ~~well~~ forever into the future.  Without that incentive, there *is* no future.

Mining altcoins and then trading them on an altcoin exchange for bitcoin is actually a way to keep mining profitably with old equipment.
But you have to be quite technically savvy to do that:  you have to constantly switch the coin you're mining and the configuration of your miners.  It's not a simple buy ASIC, read directions, plug it in, profit thing.

you are generalizing from an incredibly tiny sample:  those who are seeking help.  What about those who don't, or have a tech support resource from family or friends?  what about those *who don't need help*?
you're talking about boomers - the largest cohort of the US population, still.
and truly; you've completely written off those who - like me - are more than comfortable with *all* tech.
i can tell you that our experience is reversed:  i know very few people my age who can't easily deal with the very latest tech.  the questions i get, and the help i offer is mostly from/to those much younger than i am.
...but i would never generalize from that.  not even about my own generation; let alone about a generation of which i was not a member.

To check on bitcoin's African penetration, you might be better served to find a similar graph - but about the relationship between M-pesa and bitcoin.
Now that there's a bitcoin/M-pesa connector, that could be more accurate.  The thing is, bitcoin won't show up in bitcoin stats when it's being converted to M-pesa, I don't believe.

That would be a major PITA.  You'd have to source each payment in the blockchain, see where the payments came from, and - if proof is really important - get each donator to sign a message with their private key to prove ownership of the key from which the payment originated.
On the other hand, you could use bitcoin as it's designed for this kind of stuff:  set up your website to generate a unique payment address for each donator who sends bitcoin.

Your mining calculator doesn't input a mining difficulty increase.  It's ancient (a year old!) and basically worthless in today's environment.  Try here:
To the best of my knowledge, there are no ASIC miners that you can actually order and receive by return mail (rather than the "two week" pre-orders that stretch to six months or a year) which have a positive ROI; with even the most charitable difficulty projections, and long term operation.  Personally, I think if you have to mine for a minimum of one year just to break even, you've lost: change in electricity rates, equipment failure and downtime - even 1% internet downtime from your ISP can have a huge impact on profitability.
Mining is great - I did it through 2011 and into mid-2012.  I'll be doing it again once I can buy new or used ASICs with a positive ROI in a reasonable time frame; but not before.

In an effort to extract as many downvotes as possible from those who haven't thought it through, I will expand my thesis on the finite.
**Gold is nowhere near strictly finite.**  We have no real clue how much remains un-mined - and we don't have a particularly accurate grasp of what *has* been mined.
It will shortly (ummm... *comparatively* shortly, in an historical sense) be mined from asteroids and other astronomical bodies:  financing is already being obtained for that effort.  It **will** happen.
Before we mine it in outer space, we'll probably be able to extract it profitably from seawater.  There are 20 tons of gold - on average, across all the seas - in every cubic mile of seawater on earth.
And of course, there are nuclear reactions which can create gold out of other elements.  *Alchemy*; actual alchemy.  These reactions are well-known and quite certain:  but they are insanely expensive at the moment.
So no - gold is **not** a finite resource.  Not even a little bit.

It's a **five month** pre-order.
Do you know what that means?  It means your unit will be built sometime in the next few months, and will usually be used to mine by the manufacturer until you've complained seriously enough through your bank to get it shipped.  It means that you'll almost certainly receive a used unit - or, if you're unlucky, a defective unit that has been returned.  It means that you will almost certainly receive **nothing** until there is *ZERO* possibility of positive ROI.
Do not buy ASIC pre-orders.
The companies that manufacture ASICs are **NOT** hardware manufacturers.  *They are miners*, who have figured out a very clever way to get their mining equipment subsidized by their 'customers'.
Ask yourself this:  if you had a machine that could print hundred dollar bills, how much would you sell it for?  *Would* you sell it?  Or would you print yourself some money until the machine either broke or got so slow that repair and electricity costs were more than what it printed - and **then** sell it?
Buy your bitcoin.  That works.  Unless you've got a million or so to invest, and you know how to buy from these 'manufacturers', mining is a losing proposition.

Don't think about syncing your wallets.  That would mean using the same wallet on your mining/buying computer and your phone (which would also mean not using the qt client incidentally).  Keep just a little bit on your phone for day-to-day spending:  but no more than a little.  Phones just aren't secure enough, and I know of no way to make them secure enough to risk hundreds or thousands of dollars.
And unless you have free electricity and cooling, I'd seriously look at a good mining calculator.  If you're mining with computers - which I take to mean Not ASICs - your daily take will be tiny.  You will almost certainly be better off just buying your bitcoin - even with free electricity and cooling, given what other uses you might put those computers to (like selling them?).

Nothing like going to the source.
Feynman once said that if you couldn't explain it to a cocktail waitress in five minutes, then you didn't really understand it.  Although he stole that paraphrase from Einstein.
The thing about Zerocoin is that it's unlikely to be implemented in bitcoin any time soon.  It needs a fork, and will seriously interfere with the regulatory pursuits of the Bitcoin Foundation (which is, more or less, the devs).  The government and the banks won't like Zerocoin *at all*.
But the alt-coins are chasing the Zerocoin grail.  Megacoin just forked - preparatory, one hears, to implementing Zerocoin.  And really, as far as anonymity is concerned it doesn't matter which coin does it as long as you can trade it in and out of bitcoin.
So we're close.

The best way to buy a new car is to find out what dealer cost is, find out what your total will be (tax, title, license, various other fees), add a little profit for the dealership, and go to your bank and get a cashier's check for that amount.  Don't fill out the payee until you get a deal done.  When dealerships try to tap you for more dough, just shrug: "that's all I could get".
That's pretty much the most effective way to go about it.  Dealerships won't turn down a deal they can make just a couple hundred on - that's just pride for them.  Their money is in their service department - and they don't get that money from their customers; they get it from the manufacturers.  Long story - but that's how it is.

The real question is much simpler than posed in this article - and bitcoin is kind of irrelevant to the answer:
Can people get health care anonymously, if they're willing to pay in a way that does not identify them?
If you have a minor accident in an expensive car, do you get it covered by your insurance, or get it fixed by an *off-the-record* repair shop, so it doesn't show up in the vehicle's EquiFax report and hurt the trade-in value of the car?
By the same token, if you get drunk and fall off a wall, breaking your leg, do you cover it with your health insurance, or pay cash under a John Doe name to get it set?  What if you work for AA, or you're a not-so-devout Muslim working for a company owned by very devout Muslims?

Yes - to some degree this is true:  risk = reward.
But, more importantly to my mind, the early adopters had **foresight**.  That always deserves to be rewarded.
Lastly - and most important of all - it hasn't been exactly easy to get bitcoin where it is today.  The earliest adopters have nothing - no wealth - they didn't help create by spending, haranguing businesses to accept it, creating new business models to make bitcoin work, and so on.
The earliest adopters **got nothing** except a *possibility*.  They had to turn that possibility into a reality all by themselves, and without any historical context for guidance.

You're really new here - which isn't a bad thing, but you need some more information.  Bitcoin has been bubbling and popping for years:  that's apparently how brand new monetary systems function.  Of course, since there hasn't *been* a brand new monetary system in several hundred years, we're all kind of feeling our way...
In any case, I highly recommend reading through the historical posts on bitcointalk.org, centered around the two previous, biggest bubbles:  the June '11 bubble, and the one of April, this year.
There's a ton of good information there, and it should be a big help for you.

I think Apple will be coming out with a native bitcoin App that will work *only* with their just-announced, latest products.
By the time a year has passed, Apple should have a fingerprint database that rivals the FBIs - given to them *for free*, by every user who touches their Home button.  (n.b., I hope nobody thinks their fingerprint will stay on their phone, and not be transmitted to Apple or their three-letter partner.)
This should make for smashingly excellent security, as all the bitcoin wallet addresses used by the Apple folks will be tied to their identities, biometrically.  Security for who, though?  Interesting question...

There's lots of wallets that are good.  MultiBit is recommended generally, and I've found it to be excellent, myself.  But...
...security **starts** with your operating system.  Use some kind of *nix, or BSD.
At the very least, if you absolutely must use Windows, install VirtualBox (it's free) and put linux (it is also free) on a virtual machine for your wallet.  It's not as good as a regular *nix install, but it's much better than Windows.  Watch your access privileges...

Use the reference client, and encrypt your wallet with a strong password (EDIT:  n.b., lengthy /=/ strong).  Don't keep any wallet backups on that computer but keep plenty of backups encrypted with TrueCrypt.  Don't use wireless networking.

It's all about freedom to choose where you buy and sell, for whatever reasons you may have.
Sameness is bad.  Individuality is good.
You can spend your life dissecting every transaction you make, right down to making absolutely sure you got the best deal possible on that last pack of gum you bought.  Or you can just get on with it.
Truth?  You're happier just getting on with it - even though that's counter-intuitive, and you probably don't believe it.  Consider this:
When I sold cars for a living, there was an amazing category of customer impolitely called a 'stroke'.  [see:  The Car Salesman Dictionary, at   ]
These were the people who would spend several weeks shopping for a car, and go to a couple dozen dealerships looking for the very best possible deal.  They would spend 8 - 10 hours of their time (which was apparently without value to them) every weekend for a couple of months driving from store to store in a 1-200 mile radius, and going through the entire process over and over again.
We (the salespeople) could spot them a mile away - beards, clipboards and pipes; metaphorically or even factually - and helped them to waste their time.  When we weren't busy with actual buyers, that is.  And we would calculate how much these guys were spending - of their time, their family time, their gas money, the credit check fees, and so on - in that fruitless pursuit.  It usually worked out to a savings on the price of the car of about a hundred bucks, at a cost - all told - of over five hundred dollars, not counting their time.  Anyone can get that extra hundred bucks at the first dealership they go to.
And much more often than not they didn't buy anything.
But the interesting thing is, that when they *did* finally buy a car they were invariably the unhappiest cohort within all customer categories.  **Invariably**.  The car companies are pretty tight with customer surveys, and this unhappiness is not a theory; **it is a fact**.  They hated the cars they stuck themselves with - because they never actually let themselves buy a car they enjoyed driving.  For them, it was all about numbers and statistics and feature creep ("If I wait until next year, the Crown Vic will have wipers on the headlights!") and Consumer Reports.  The sheets of paper they stuck in their clipboards never had a checkbox for:  "Do I like it?"
Which begs the question:  who are the happiest customers?
*The Laydowns*:  those who walk into the closest dealership, find something they like the looks of that fits their lives, spend an hour or two buying it and drive away.  The thought of that extra hundred bucks never crosses their minds.  They want a car they like, and accept that owning something you like is worth a little more.
It's a description of human nature - not a put-down.  It's one way people deal with the fear of commitment, I guess.
Sound familiar?
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:30:20
Doesn't sound like you should.  Nothing wrong with being a non-driver - I didn't learn myself until I was 28.  If you're happy as is, then don't.
I must say though, that in the time I spent selling cars, I never once sold one to somebody who didn't drive.

Firstly, in order to properly implement Zerocoin in the reference client, a hard fork is required. We don't like hard forks - or we shouldn't.  And that's not going to happen until there are reasons the devs consider to be more pressing.  We might see one, planned hard fork before version 1.0 of bitcoin-qt is released.  Maybe.  And they're saving up things to do them all at once; if it even happens.
Secondly, there is a majority faction among the devs, Foundation, &amp; etc. who are pushing hard to get bitcoin integrated into the government's regulatory environment:  with KYC and all the other de-anonymizing requirements as a required part of that.  There are plusses and minuses about that - but it's obvious that de-anonymizing bitcoin even further is the easiest path to government acceptance (I express no opinion on that, here - it's simply an apparent reality of dealing with the government).  Adding a layer of pure anonymity to bitcoin would serious impact these negotiations - probably so badly that we'd never be able to get a US bank to accept any transactions associated with any bitcoin user again - or at least not for a long, long time.  That's not so good for world-wide adoption.
*However*...  there are alt-coins - most notably Megacoin - that are working hard to implement Zerocoin or some other form (Coinjoin and/or Amir's scheme) of anonymity.  And when that happens (it looks like Megacoin might have that working in just a few days), it will be possible to anonymize bitcoin by trading in and out of that alt-coin.  It shouldn't have a terrible impact on efforts to bring bitcoin into the banking/legal mainstream, as the alt-coins are a separate matter, and outside of bitcoin's control.
That's what I think about it, anyway.  Looked at in a certain way, implementing Zerocoin into an alt-coin - but not into bitcoin itself - is probably the best of both worlds...

You're neglecting the long-term impact of block reward halvings.  Among other things.
But, more importantly...
...and frankly, speaking as an ex-miner, I'm kind of tired of people trying to chisel miners out of their ability to earn a living.  Most miners are, too - and as they control which transactions they include, I think they'll be OK.
But that doesn't make it any more palatable to listen to the whining about the fees that keep our network functional, by people who want a free ride.

Yes - that's the *law* ($10k within a month).  But where screwing little guys is concerned, the banks are always willing when it scores them protective points for themselves and their big-fish customers.  They do forward all kinds of things to the government that they're not legally bound to.


I was responding to the OP's mention of 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' there - not $10k.

Watch out for 'dust':  i.e., transaction amounts so small that they'll cost more in fees to send than they will net you.  Or when grouped together in a single transmission, the fees for all the tiny inputs will have the same result.
You may find yourself having to hold the tinier amounts until bitcoin is worth more, or until the devs come up with a way around this problem (they're working on it...).

The major corporations of the world control governments.  Pretty much all of them.
Government regulation has done more damage to bitcoin already, than all the ripoffs and scams combined.  Gox has been crippled in the U.S. and elsewhere, Dwolla was forced into total fuckery (instead of standing up like decent people) that destroyed Tradehill and a couple other businesses, regulation has already essentially destroyed the exchange market in the UK (the epicenter of financial skullduggery).  There's a pretty long list already.

Yes, all agreed.
It is going to be absolutely fascinating to watch governments try to adapt to cryptocurrencies.
I'm not politically anti-tax.  There are simply far too many things we need as a civilization that require the financial leverage of ubiquitous taxation - and which would *never* be adequately funded on a volunteer basis:  health care, hard infrastructure, safety infrastructure, and so on.
If there is any one, positive thing that I see coming out of Bitcoin - especially in the US, but probably world-wide - it is the adoption of a pure VAT system of taxation.  Which, to paraphrase Winston Churchill's remarks on democracy, is certainly awful - but much less awful than any other system.

No.  Sorry.  You should look into Pricing Theory.  The most profitable price algorithm for a good or service will *always* be high enough that some people (obviously those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder) won't be able to afford it.
So really, what an untaxed free market provides is the choice between starving, death by contaminated food, or devoting your life to doing nothing but growing and guarding your own food.
And yes, governments waste money - you're right.  But on the whole they still spend less on the services we all need to live safe and healthy lives, than if it were all at the mercy of some bizarre Randian Utopia.

"Riskier products"?
I've been a dealer in antiquarian collectibles for over 50 years - there's no risk there at all.  Except paying too much or asking too little.
Tell you a story...
When the internet was so new that it wasn't the internet...  before mouse trails and blinking text and even before there was such a thing as a web page... we talked to each other on the 'net.  Just talked - kind of like we do now:  full circle.
And then, anyway, some bright person figured out how to put actual pictures onto the web.  So what happened?
Well... porn, of course.  But at the same exact time - really!  I was there! - the sellers of rarities and antiquities got on board.  As they always have.  Because - odd as it might seem - it's the dealers in memory who take advantage of the newest.  Always.

It's stupid - nobody is going to spend the money to do an attack to get the seven or eight blocks that would likely be the most they'd get.  If governments get together and decide to end bitcoin, they'll just ban it, regulate P2P, and throw a few people in jail.  If some big corporation wants to end bitcoin, they'll just get their lackeys (the government) to do that.
WTF is this pie-in-the-sky paranoia, anyway?  The 51% exists as a possibility - that's all.  A lot of things exist **that nobody will ever do** because it makes no sense:  nuclear first strikes for example...

Convenient (i.e., high speed transactions, in your example) F2F purchasing isn't going to happen for awhile.  Realistically, bitcoin will need some integration with the existing fiat plastic systems for that to work well - and the banks aren't really into it at the moment.
Let's keep in mind that plastic fiat was designed for F2F transactions - and it does that well.  What it *doesn't* do well is the internet.  The vast majority of plastic fraud by buyers is 'Card Not Present' fraud, which is internet stuff.
Bitcoin *is* designed for the internet - buyer fraud simply isn't possible.  And time for confirmation isn't an issue at all.
Eventually, my belief is that there will have to be some kind of truce between these two systems so that they can interoperate.  I think that's possible - probably inevitable.  The plastic fiat/banking side will simply have to concede the point that they can't really compete with bitcoin over the internet.

One of the interesting things about localbitcoins, is that you can sell to yourself.
Let us suppose - just for the hell of it - that you had your eye on a nice little one-bedroom apartment that you wanted to buy; for $50,000.  So you sell $50kUSD worth of coin (about 385 BTC today, at $140 each) on bitstamp, buy the apartment, *et voila!*
Uh oh... Tax time.
"Ah - but you see, Mr. IRS, that I made no profit selling those coin:  here's my blockchain record of my original purchase of those 385 BTC; purchased on localbitcoins for $152 each from my cash savings that I keep under my mattress... and you'll please note that the date on that transaction was April 24th.

@_date: 2013-12-17 22:45:42
Because it would cut banks out of the equation.  A deposit into your bank account by some individual *via* ACH or SEPA, on a one-time basis, couldn't be connected to bitcoin - and so the banks would have no basis to interfere.
People have been working on it for quite awhile now - and like I said, it's a tough nut.

What is the point you're really trying to make here?


Nobody gets anything stolen sending and receiving.  They get ripped off for having poor wallet security:  mostly in how they choose to *store* (not *use* ) their coins.
Best estimates are 2 1/2 - 3 million actual users, at the moment.
We hear about a couple of thefts or so every day - and a significant proportion of those are trolls pushing bullshit.  How much theft of US dollars is there, on a daily basis?
There are thieves.  Wherever you go and whatever you do, there are thieves.  Deal with it.  Deal with your personal security.

Coinbase is not an exchange.  If you want instantaneous back-and-forthing of coins and fiat, then you want an exchange.
Coinbase is the most successful company in the Bitcoin space because they don't cater to the need for speed - they just see to it that folks can get their hands on the coin.  That used to be the biggest complaint in bitcoin - not being able to get the coin.
All companies have their purpose and proper use:  just like any other tool.  Don't use a hammer to put a screw into a wall.

1.  It's just a very early account.  It doesn't have to be Satoshi - could be *any* very early cypherpunk.
2.  Satoshi's wallets have been fairly seriously speculated to be 50BTC each.  Nothing of his is speculated to be 77k in a single wallet:  as the mystery account contained.
3.  Silk Road sold many kinds of drugs, including some fairly esoteric prescription drugs.
4.  If I were to wildly speculate about who those facts pointed to - early, esoteric drugs, 77k wallet, and postulating that I'm not a reporter who needs sizzle to sell a story - I'd be thinking Hal Finney.
77k is more in keeping with what little we know about the size of his very early (he *received* the first bitcoin transaction, sent from Satoshi) accumulation.  He is quite ill, and probably willing to try just about any new, esoteric drug he can get his hands on.
He has a thread on bitcointalk.  Somebody should ask him.

Bitcoin saves me money on transactions - although probably not that much.  Those transaction costs don't make or break a given deal, or my choice of payment.
What bitcoin **really** saves, is my ass.  I sell cheap stuff - collectibles - on eBay (less than a hundred dollars or two), and it's OK.  I get ripped off by the fraudsters once in awhile, although I insure for over $50.
But the *expensive stuff* I sell to my list.  And I sell it for bitcoin only.  I can't get ripped off with chargebacks, or other fraud.  An item that sells for a few thousand dollars hurts, when you get ripped off - and there's a practical limit to how many insurance claims you can put in before the fraudster begins to look like *you*.

The fallacy there is based on the assumption of either incompetence or greed.  Probably speaks more to the author - which ones posits isn't you.  The only thing Bridgewalker has to do if bitcoin crashes, to see to it that they can get enough coin for their customers is:  1.) only buy enough to meet their ongoing needs under any exchange situation, and 2.) not steal.

I've sold on eBay since very early on.
I have no problem at all with the fees.  I've owned B&amp;M's, and I won't ever do that again: paying 12-13% as opposed to *maybe* (on a good month) taking *home* 12-13% is a no-brainer.
But I remember when you could leave feedback for buyers, 
Meh.  It's good for building and maintaining reputation.  And moving cheap stuff quick.  But I sell all my expensive stuff elsewhere or on my own site.  And a lot of it for bitcoin.
There's just too much buyer fraud on eBay, and they don't care.

That's all true - if unwieldy and Byzantine.  *But*... simple question...
If the deal went south and a buyer wanted to get out of it two days, two weeks or two months later - do they get their **bitcoins back**?  Or fiat representing the cash value of the deal?  And *which* cash value:  then or now?
The only way they could keep reversibility is to pay Sellers in fiat only - **no matter how the buyer paid**.
And the only way they could accept bitcoin from buyers is if refunds were always in fiat.
Taking bitcoin the way they would have to would be an even worse screw job than what they're doing now.

Explain mining as a way to support the protocol, and maybe break even in doing so.  That seems sufficient to me.
And focusing on it is how you lose people.  Because mining is a huge hole into which one pours money:  you know it and I know it.
MINING IS OVER.  At least as a way to make bitcoin.
If you would like to continue this, you show me unequivocally how mining - using any brand of hardware, available to anyone - can be **at all** profitable.
It's fucking **over**.  Just drop it and move on to the things that bitcoin can do for the average user on an average day.  There's a lot of them - and they add up to a considerable whole.
Bitcoin is amazing:  financially, conveniently, politically.  Why push fairies?
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:06:30


Yeah.  That's the problem.  It isn't the forum software (although yes, that's in serious need of work), so much as the people there.  *It is - to quote gavin, jgarzik and several others as equally well-regarded in the community -* a **cesspool**.
Proper moderation is the key - but **thermos** (love it - I hope it sticks) is into the old-guard libertarian BS, and will never get past that.  It doesn't make him a bad person - just a not-terribly-effective mod.
I offered some decent suggestions about 2 1/2 years ago - oh... did anyone think this is a recent problem? - suggestions that were reasonably well-received, but ultimately nothing came of them:  because change...  But just for the hell of it, again, here's the truth:
That forum will never be the place where you send your mom to learn about bitcoin until the racism, misogyny, and outright thievery goes away.  Don't feel special, except in the breach.  There are plenty of forums on the 'net that have had these problems, and they have all resolved them in pretty much the same way:  **effective self-moderation**.
The best model to look at is probably DailyKos.  They have plenty of trolls, plenty of posters whose goal is to disrupt and hurt the site; and yet hardly any of that shows to the users because they are all invested in keeping the quality of the site up to the highest standard.  Upvoting and downvoting things actually means something there, commensurate with the karma of the user doing it - high-karma users can get a post sent to unreadable oblivion by themselves, without a mod.  It's interesting to note that as contentious as that site gets, and as seriously devoted as their political opponents are to destroying it, the ratio of mods to users is among the lowest of any site on the internet.  Forget about politics and check out the way the site works sometime.  It's really a model of moderation without equal.

Yes - this has been a hot topic of discussion here and there, for quite awhile.  The problem is trusting third parties.  What's needed is something in the protocol itself - a Dead Man's Switch - that will send your Bitcoin off to your heir, in the event you don't check in and verify that you're still alive.
And no - if you're wondering - the *nLockTime* function won't do it.
I'm convinced that it'll eventually happen, given what some of the devs have said - but it's unfortunately of low priority.

They could.  It would be amazing.
But here's the catch...
At least on the reservations around where I am (Minnesota/NDak/SDak/Iowa), a business run on a reservation **MUST** be owned in the majority by a tribe member.  That isn't negotiable, and it's a tribal law - not a US law.
So... anybody know any blood Native Americans who are early enough adopters to have the resources to start an exchange - or even get some ATMs placed?  Or who - at the least - are seriously involved with bitcoin?
Y'know... thinking about it... this could actually be a *very* effective way around some of the problems we're having with the financial infrastructure in the US.

Oh.  You misunderstand...
This is a nice conversation *on a theoretical level* - but you missed the part where I said I  thought merchants accepting bitcoin was the most important thing.  Because I didn't...
I haven't ever said that walking around with little gram-pieces of gold and being able to spend *them*, is all that relevant to the most important use-cases for gold, or to *its* value, either.
I mean, it's nice to be able to spend the stuff (bitcoin) - and I will certainly always make an effort to get retailers to accept it - but my personal belief is that the future of bitcoin adoption is in the back end, just like gold:  wealth transfer, final settlement, store of value, asset privacy &amp; etc.
I also understand that bitcoin is clearly superior to gold as a PoS payment vehicle.  But honestly?  I don't think it will ever supplant fiat at the PoS, any more than you do, apparently.
However, this:


...I see as a failure of imagination.
Firstly because adapting modern payment systems - like NFC and other wave'n'pay implementations - to bitcoin, is really trivial.  So why not?
But secondly - and perhaps more importantly where smaller merchants, especially, are concerned - voluntary exposure to exchange rate fluctuation is something I see as beneficial.  I don't think it should be *forced*, obviously.  But I do think if merchants want to play a little forex on the side, there's nothing wrong with it - and it might just help our somewhat under-educated society to learn a bit more about how money really works.
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:18:02
Depends on how much money is involved.  A public place is good - but for a *lot* of money (however you define that) a public place with guns is excellent:  by which I mean the lobby of a bank or even the waiting area at your local police precinct.  (And by which I do *not* mean carrying a weapon yourself.  That seldom works out well at need, without considerable training and experience.)

EDIT:  and no - when alcohol was banned, demand went up - and supply went through the roof.

My only additional thought is that the rumors have been around since February - and if true, they may already have bought some.  I wonder how many they'd need for escrow?  Every time a deal was done they'd release coins they held already from escrow; but replace them with the coins from the deal.  At least I think that's how it would work.  They might not need as many as one would think, at first glance.

If you don't want to connect your bank account when you buy, that's your business - but it *will* be connected at some point along the way.

@_date: 2013-09-03 23:48:30
Really?  OK - I'll explain.
I'm sick of hearing people scream "scam!" and "they stole from me!" and other ridiculous crap every time something doesn't go exactly the way they want it to go.
Are you capable of standing back and looking at your own life objectively?  How many addresses have you had in the past five years?  How many phone numbers?  How many bank accounts?  Ever failed to make a payment on time?
Do you understand that Coinbase has all that information about you - easily as much as Google does, if not more?  And they can only set up software checks?  It's not like they can look at every transaction manually, you know.
Do you understand how difficult what they're doing is?  They are far and away the very best that bitcoin has to offer, as a money exchanger of any kind.  And their job is insane:  they're wending their way through a completely bogus and barely defined regulatory environment.  They have to cover their asses more than any online company out there, and there's nobody to go to to tell them how to do it.  Their job sucks.  And you - along with every other accusatory, thoughtless person they deal with - make that job harder.
They're the best we've got, and we should be supportive (assuming the goal is for bitcoin to succeed).  And yet, every time something doesn't go exactly the way people (like you) want it to go, the first thing that happens is the screams of "scam!" and "theft!".  Which is the purest bullshit.
They make their living doing deals, doing them less-expensively than their competition, and maintaining the best reputation they can, despite the - literally - hundreds of accusations of dirty dealings that crop up here and elsewhere:  completely unfounded, without any merit at all, and promulgated by those  without a care in the world other than for their own needs.
You aren't special.  Got it?  They are.
And no - I've got no connection to Coinbase at all, other than as a customer.
So tell us this:  between the time you got that email, and the time you posted your scam accusation here on reddit, what effort of any kind did you make to resolve the matter politely?  Did you give any thought at all to bitcoin itself, and the success we all wish for it?  Did you look at yourself, and ask if there might be a reason they turned the deal down - and give some thought to how to resolve the matter on that basis?
Hope that answers your question.

Firstly, 5% is not a "significant amount" by any measure with which I am familiar.
Secondly, the FBI's confiscated bitcoin will eventually work their way back into circulation.  There are laws about that sort of thing, you know - and even in the case where the FBI used some of those bitcoin in sting operations, or as a hard to track payment to informants, they would still get back into circulation.
Not that any of that has anything at all to do with your sour grapes original post.

This post was submitted almost two hours ago - from when I'm typing this.
If you had bought one bitcoin at the moment you posted, you would now be roughly five dollars richer.
If you had sent somebody $3000 for a gen-2 ASIC miner (see pitchbend**'s post), you would already be in the hole - with no hope of showing a profit ever, unless the exchange rate stayed the same as it is now (kinda doubtful) and then shot up after you got your miner and fired it up.
Mining is dead for the little guys - without a huge amount of luck finding dirt-cheap ASICs.
Don't screw around and miss the boat.  You're *still* an early adopter.  Just barely.  Spend your money on the coin, not the equipment.
And always use 2FA.

I haven't done it myself, if that's what you mean.  It's quite well-known though, and has even been offered out in the open by some exchanges.  It's not something that requires proof - only a little research.

I never even consider this when using a credit card.  Points aren't free.  *Nothing* is free.  You pay for it somewhere - and frankly, I'm happier without that crap tacked on to my transactions and confusing the financial basis for them.
I accept bitcoin as a seller because it's safe.  My customers have my reputation - and my desire to maintain it - as their security.
I use bitcoin as a buyer because it's frequently cheaper (and this is becoming true much more often than it was), it keeps me off bullshit sales lists, it's good anywhere in the world without currency exchange charges, it stops the identification and quantification of my online profile by the various bad actors in the world (banks, intelligence/LE agencies, Google, &amp; etc.), and many other reasons.

Silk Road has the biggest share of bitcoin use on Tor.  These days they represent less than 1% of bitcoin's overall transaction numbers, last I read.

Well maybe those are words that ought to be used, rather than "ripping off", hmmm...?
That's under the assumption that you get no satisfaction from Coinbase.  Which I don't believe happens.  I'm a fan - that doesn't mean that since I signed up (about when they first opened) everything has been perfect.  It hasn't.  But I've always gotten a fully satisfactory resolution from them, and always in a timely manner.
Just keep in mind that the definition of "timely manner" has changed.  When they first started up I had an issue, and it took a matter of hours to resolve - the first response beginning that resolution happened within minutes.
The last time I needed to contact support it took a couple of days for them to get back to me.  So what?  How can an even remotely rational being not understand the insane pace of their growth, and what that means in terms of customer service?
Everybody wants a break - but nobody wants to give one...
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:04:44
Interesting set of assumptions on your part.


Well, no - it isn't.  Easy as pie on Coinbase - if you're not a financial n00b without any history, or a criminal.  And who says you have to buy them anyway?  Me, I mined first - then bought.  And there's an awful lot of miners out there.


Why is that your assumption?  Does it help your argument?  Most of those Gyft cards can be used in-store - and most of *those* don't require any wait time, as they can be used on your phone and scanned at the register right off your screen.  I can buy a Gyft amount over 3G or 4G while I'm in the store, and spend it at the register in ten minutes.


And of course, I don't get why you consider that to be a bad thing, in the cases where shipping is needed.  Seems like Amazon has made a tolerably good business model out of that whole shipping thing...
But then, your posting history is marginally subtle, but quite clear when it comes to bitcoin.

OK - so where did you buy these coins, and how did you fund the purchase?
It's mathematically a sure thing that if those two transactions last in the blockchain, you paid $80 twice to someone, or they screwed up and finalized the transaction twice.   But you probably don't want to splash all your details all over the 'net.
I'd just wait for awhile, and see what happens: both with the exchange I bought the coins at, and whatever institution I used to fund the purchase.

It's true - mining ain't much anymore unless you've got the dough to demand instant delivery on the latest ASICs.  That's a lot of dough - you couldn't play that scene with less than serious six figures.  It's also a lot of your time:  you have to go to the production facilities and verify that you're getting new shit (*not* returns), and that each piece works.  They usually mine with that stuff before they send it out - **all** of them, you dig? - so you *really* need to be careful.
But yeah...  if you want to listen to me (I have no idea why you'd want to, but what evs), just buy.

Well, for starters they don't have to pay the markup that retailers add to cover their VISA fees.  And their banking fees.  And their fraud fees (sold on eBay recently?).  I've bought an awful lot of stuff for under Amazon pricing, in bitcoin...
And yeah - as you point out, there's no chargeback,  Speaking as a Seller, I love that - because my reputation is important to me; but it's **mine**.  When I'm a buyer though, it makes me more careful about who I buy from.
And y'know something?  Careful buyers lead to careful sellers - and we **all** benefit from that.
@_date: 2013-09-07 00:27:31
As I recall, the last time somebody calculated it out (and these things are always subject to change:  a *lot* of change.  This is bitcoin, after all...) transaction fees should be roughly equal to the block reward when that reward gets down to 6.25 BTC/block.  It depends on what numbers you pull out of your ass for adoption though - it could be 3.125.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:05:19


But they don't.  Remember that they buy and sell, both.
Most of the coins they sell are coins that they have freshly bought from their customers who are cashing out.  They only have to buy from another exchange when their sales are out of balance.  That happens, but not as often as you'd think:  their cushion is pretty big.

If a shop owner accepts raw bitcoin, his **income** is in the blockchain (which doesn't necessarily make it traceable, but can; depending on how he manages the addresses) - not his **spending**.
But more importantly, any shop that uses a payment service like bitpay or Coinbase, keeps their books quite happily out of the public eye to the extent that all payments go to addresses owned by the processor, not the shopkeeper.

No.  Nodes are how many instances of the reference client are known to have been running in the past (in this case) five weeks.
Just the reference client.  (Essentially:  there are some very few exceptions - customized clients of other types)
That number does not include any other wallet:  none of the light clients, none of the Android clients, none of the SMS clients in Africa, none of the off-blockchain clients that connect to centralized or proprietary servers (like Bridgewalker, for example).
**lifeboatz** (the parent above) estimated 2-3 million total clients.  I think that's quite low, at this point.  I'd say somewhere around 10 million.

I think an easy way to refer to bitcoins is... bitcoins.
And if you have less than one, then numerical decimal notation works.  Like 0.01~~B~~:  which is shorter than screwing around with decimal prefixes, and **absolutely clear**.  No mistakes possible, like with 'deci' and 'deca'.

It totally is - you're right.
That said, is it a terrible mindset to have?
@_date: 2013-09-02 16:44:25


No - there are plenty of cases where people get their money back when that happens.  Not all - but plenty.  The point is that you're better protected with a bank than you are on a bitcoin exchange.  If someone steals your fiat off an exchange you're screwed.
That was one of the things that attracted me to Coinbase - they don't hold fiat.  They transfer it to your bank as soon as the deal's done.  Which means they aren't technically an exchange, but I don't day trade so that doesn't matter to me.
@_date: 2013-09-22 06:36:27

 - Getting a "large group of billionaires" together to do anything is like herding cats.  They all hate each other.  That said, they'd have little success trying to corner the market:  if they buy BTC outright the price goes up too quickly; if they try to outmine everyone their lag time on ASICs makes the whole idea fail.  TL;DR - ain't gonna happen.
 - Sorry, this makes no sense.  You don't understand what you're asking, so nobody else will, either.
 - Spend bitcoins to support bitcoin and spread the word.  Use a Bridgewalker wallet on your phone to eliminate counterparty (currency fluctuation) risk.

Check out **gmaxwell's** CoinJoin thread at bitcointalk.
That noted, it's unlikely that anything like this will find its way into the reference wallet (Bitcoin-qt) as long as there are so many statists and nanny authoritarians in the Foundation.
But once **gmaxwell** and/or any other devs who care to contribute get CoinJoin working conveniently in some wallet or another, I'll be switching.
Honestly, I expect a fork of some kind - hopefully only a client fork, rather than a blockchain fork; but I think it's likely to happen.
And yes - you're right:  there's Dark Wallet too.  Although that's less developed and has less of a track record behind it than **gmaxwell's** CoinJoin.

It's not even so much the cost of the things, as it is just finding that many available ASIC miners.
The current hashrate is a mishmosh of CPUs (yes - there *are* still people using those), GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs.

We're almost all kind of not-exactly-mainstream-money-people.  There's going to be some weird startups and some general strangeness brought forth upon the world of historically conventional money/business realities.
It's easy to see that bitcoin will change the way banks do business, and how the world interacts with money in general.  But I'm seriously wondering if the *people* involved with bitcoin now, won't have an even greater impact on the world.  What would the world be like today, if Tesla had been wealthy?

It is a common belief in the conventional investment community that pooled investments are safer, more secure, and open up opportunities for lower level investors that they couldn't afford individually.
It's true.
In bitcoin however, the reverse is true.  In almost all pooled investments, the risk of theft and dishonesty is greater, they are less secure from hackers and governments, and the fees and charges are *much* higher than just buying and holding bitcoin themselves.
Remember that.

@_date: 2013-10-01 07:17:10


No, it isn't.  I buy things online with bitcoin (I have been since early 2011, and so have some decent comparators), and detect no difference at all between it and a VISA as far as time or ease goes.  Same number of clicks (one less for bitcoin in some cases), same amount of keyboarding.  I note that using bitcoin is sometimes less expensive, as merchants pass on their payment charge savings - this is happening more often, lately.
I further note that from a merchant's perspective, bitcoin is **much** more advantageous.  Anecdotally, I sell higher-dollar items for bitcoin only - which completely eliminates the possibility of fraud.  (I sell collectibles on eBay - but I won't sell anything there for over a couple hundred bucks, max.  Any more and it's bitcoin-only, to my private list.)


Nah.  Not until they can be consummated off-chain.  Why is it that micro-transactions are always touted as the best use case by those who say that bitcoin 'has possibilities', or 'isn't quite ready yet', or 'needs work'?  Curious, that.  The fact is that bitcoin is extremely effective in any number of use cases right now:  international transfer and settlement, ending currency exchange fees, P2P F2F payments, online payments, escrow payments, triple-entry accounting, identity verification... really, the list is pretty long, and getting longer.


Not true.  Anytime bitcoin needs to process more than 7tps, the protocol additions are ready to go - no fork required.  There are any number of threads by the main devs on this.  Do your research.


That is only your opinion.  And frankly, reality doesn't care what you or I think - bitcoin **is** both a commodity and a currency.  You'll just have to deal with that.

I haven't said what they're doing is likely to make sense.

It's a moot point.
If the internet ever goes down, you're going to have a lot of things on your plate.  None of them will involve bitcoin, and it's unlikely that too many of them will even involve money - except maybe coin silver.
If the internet is *taken* down (a different scenario altogether), bitcoin could still work.  There's mesh networking and a few other ways to get TCP/IP running clandestinely.  There's even IP over ham radio.  All of those things would be predicated on taking the internet back from whoever or whatever took it down:  so you'd still probably have other things on your mind...

I'm not so sure that's the case.
As far as I can tell, the problem with adding a new payment method is PayPal.  Anecdotally, that appears to cause issues frequently enough that I'm not uncomfortable with assuming PayPal is discouraging bitcoin competition in some backchannel.  Maybe I'm wrong though.
But another thing to consider is the WordPress debacle.  Pushing bigger companies to adopt bitcoin, succeeding, and then having that adoption become an embarrassing irrelevancy, is not helpful.  It probably hurts the overall public perception of bitcoin.

Why?  If you're worried about exchange rate fluctuation you use BitPay or Coinbase, and the bitcoins are exchanged into fiat instantly, at the rate prevailing the very second of the transaction.
If - like me, for example - you are in it for the long haul, you just take the bitcoin and hold them.

It's too late for that particular scenario.  They couldn't get their hands on enough ASIC hardware; and the network - at almost 400 TH, with double that coming in the next few months - is way too powerful to control with anything other than ASICs.  Even super computers wouldn't do the job - not that the banks haven't got better uses for theirs.
And of course, if they tried to buy up all the available coin, the price would stop them as it went up...

Because mining with your old, retired GPU is still viable with alt-coins.  The difficulty level on all of them is quite appealingly low.  So you mine alt-coins, and then trade them for bitcoin.
And if you pick the right alt-coin to mine, it'll go up nicely before you trade it.  Win-win!

Diversify.  Get into a couple of the alt-coins that actually have a unique and valuable use case.
Anonymity is going to be the big thing - so Zerocoin, Coinjoin, and so on.  So get into a couple of the alt-coins that are going to be first in that arena:  that is, first to implement one of the anonymity overlays.  Bitcoin won't be doing that anytime soon.  Anoncoin and Megacoin have possibilities.  And Megacoin has the sneaky undercurrents of a Kim Dotcom project.

I don't hate fiat.  It has its uses, just like bitcoin.
The whole "intrinsic value" argument is bullshit though.  Nothing stands by itself as a Platonic representation of ideal value.  Not bitcoin:  which requires electricity and computers and networks.  And not gold:  which requires alloying with other metals to be useful, and which really isn't as valuable in those oft-quoted categories of its mythical intrinsic value as any number of other materials.
One thing I note is that the industrial value of gold - which you point out as being low - is actually lower than commonly held.  Because part of that value (a very *large* part) is what must be subtracted from that industrial value to express what gold costs in its final tally.  Think of the environmental destruction of gold - the acids released into our biosphere, the petrochemicals required to dig, refine and transport it.  Think of the CO2 released from all the concrete poured to house it securely.  The guards, the assay requirements..  The entire infrastructure of that metal is a **huge** drain on our civilization.  Which sort of answers your question of:


But truly, the answer to that question is within the question itself:  "...the force of the military..." is why fiat currencies and even gold are inferior.  They cost us so much, those slaves of violence.  Bitcoin requires none of that.  Not that armies aren't needed for other reasons; but not for that form of money, anyway.

I've been dealing with Coinbase since they started up - and I've never had a problem, no matter how large the spread.  They cover their buys the second they're made.
Has it occurred to you that your transaction stopped being between you and Coinbase the second your bank bounced the charge, and is now between **only** you and your bank?
You won't receive "your" 10 BTC.  And you shouldn't.

Satoshi was a fucking genius.  That incentive is built in.
He saw that there would be fantastic price rises at the beginning (Have you read his posts at bitcointalk?  They're all there for the reading...) - and **that** is the incentive for use today.
Later - as the price stabilizes more and more - the incentives will be different:  wealth transfer out of government reach, convenient PoS currency usage, savings on transfer/transaction fees (those savings today are there, but aren't nearly what they can, and will be), triple-entry accounting becoming standard, two-party escrow, and everything else that bitcoin brings to the table.
So I see *plenty* of incentive; both now and later.

People lose money from their bank accounts every day to hackers.  The banks just don't say anything about it, and make the losses good.
Dollars are NOT more secure - they're just so debased that adding a few to the ledger with a mouse click has become the standard answer to theft.  It's *soooo* much easier than investigating, pursuing, charging and convicting.  Let's face it:  catching and punishing crooks is expensive; certainly more expensive than adding some infinitesimally tiny bit of inflation to the dollar.
Seriously - if you were the guy who needed to make a decision... $850k to put a guy behind bars who stole $50k from a bank, or forget about it and add back $50k to the 2 Trillion already in circulation (an amount of inflation which I see no need to calculate the tininess of)...

Actually, it's a not-possible thing.
Even if you could freeze the slippage and buy half the bitcoin that exist for $900 M or so (...one of those before-breakfast impossibilities to believe in), **there isn't a single human on earth** with that much money who doesn't *absolutely* understand that to do so would completely destroy the market - and therefore destroy the investment.  Not one.
This isn't even a valid hypothetical.
But to answer the title, the big sharks have been here for at least a year - and probably longer, in a couple of fairly obvious cases.  They've been careful not to disrupt the market too badly, and to not be too greedy.  They've been pretty good for the market.


...and they are **definitely** no threat.  In fact, they are the *least* threatening, of any bitcoin use segment, to bitcoin's future.  It should be simple to understand that the 'big fish' have more knowledge of markets, and more invested, than anyone else.  So, given that, why would they hurt their own investment?

All I can think of is this:
Start up an alt-coin with a known, short lifetime - and with a central server rather than a decentralized, distributed blockchain.  Trade in and out of it with bitcoin, and then end it:  delete its blockchain and just end it.
Once it was ended, there would be no way to connect the trades to the bitcoins that moved in an out of the alt-coin.  A government that was able to steal a copy of that blockchain wouldn't have anything usable in court - because a copy of a dead blockchain could not be forensically verified against a live blockchain, and could be proven to be trivial to alter.
There are certainly trust issues with a scheme like that - but no more so than with any other mixer.

By the time he got there all the really evil people had killed each other, the shovel-sellers had too much competition to rip people off, and there was enough government infrastructure so that folks didn't have to party up to guard against the claim jumpers.
He spent a couple years on the sluices, a couple in a mine he bought, and retired to Fresno.  He kept the family in beer and chips until the Great Depression.

I sell antiquities, on eBay (cheap - PayPal) and on my own site (expensive - Bitcoin).
This year I did about $12k on eBay.  Just the PayPal charges were around $350-400.  Roughly.  Haven't done taxes yet.
I did about $75k on my site for Bitcoin.  I don't use a payment processor - I take it direct.  Bitcoin charges were about (*very* roughly - there's been some variance in the exchange rate... heh...) $25 USD equivalent.  That represents transaction fees for postage overage refunds - a frequent occurrence - and transaction fees for a couple of folks who asked for refunds.
I've cashed some coin for USD for various reasons, if you want to count that.  Coinbase fees are... ??? 1%???  Not sure.

The environmental impact of bitcoin is negligible, compared to the earth-rape that goes on to pull gold or silver out of the ground.  To transport those valuables, to safeguard them, and to work them into purity.
Even the environmental impact of paper currency is awful, in comparison:  banks, armored cars that get 6 mpg, security guards, dead trees, poisonous manufacturing runoff from papers and inks...


This is frequently the case.  So?  Plan on that - and buy bitcoin outright when it is prudent to do that.  Mining is no longer in the realm of the little guy - any more than gold mining (which today means refining a couple of grams out of a few tons of crap) is.  You can support the network with an ASIC, for the cost in electricity of a quarter of a high-efficiency lightbulb.  Do that.  Solo mine.  Feel good about supporting the cause - and maybe you'll get lucky.

Where did I say it was *immune*?  I didn't and it isn't.
What I said was that to do it would be stupid; whatever the motivation.  There's no point in doing it for money, because you couldn't get anywhere near what it would cost - but what a massive amount of money you could make with that kind of investment.  And there's no point for a government or corporation to do it to hurt, or end, bitcoin - because they have easier and cheaper ways to do *that*.
That's all.  It's just a patently dumb idea for anyone to try.  And so it's a pretty sure thing that nobody will bother.  It's been analyzed to death - and there's just no point to the effort.
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:14:33
I wasn't aware of them.  It's amazing how quickly bitcoin grows and how much new stuff there always is to learn.

We do not.  And yes - it has been refuted.
There will be no 'race to the bottom'.  Transaction speed will become more and more important:  a 'race to the top' is expected.


...is flawed.  There will be *every* reason to discriminate:  this is at the heart of the discussion about raising the block-size limit.  Think about it.
And transaction fees per block will be more than the mining reward by the time the reward equals 3.125, at the latest, last I saw it calculated out.

As long as bitcointalk has been up, there's so many modifications, customizations and tweaks, that trying to float everything over to another software with some generic script could very well result in the entire internet imploding in on itself like a fresh black hole.
It's going to be SMF until somebody breaks loose of some serious dough.  And that's probably unlikely.  It's not the kind of forum that'll lead that person/entity to think their money is well-spent on behalf of bitcoin:  it's kind of a vast wasteland of misogyny, racism and scamming.

It's not that tough to run a site like that - there's plenty of successful examples.  It just doesn't fit too well with the bulk of the early adopter types.

Don't.  You'll get frustrated.
If you put that small an amount into your wallet you won't be able to spend it, because the fee to do so for such a tiny amount will be more than what's in your wallet.
And no - that's not a bug.  It's a feature; and a *good* thing.
You'll catch on - just never stop researching.  I've been doing bitcoin since very early 2011, and there's always something new to discover, always something of value to learn just around the corner.
So get an account with Coinbase and put twenty bucks into your wallet.  Buy some stuff on line.  Screw around with it for reals.
Don't limit yourself and frustrate your ability to learn by screwing around with pennies.  OK?
Good luck.

Probably not.  The point of the devs working on a way to consolidate dust is precisely to avoid that.  They're *very* concerned with fungibility - which is to say that there *should never* be any difference at all between a hundred dollar bill and ten thousand pennies, as far as using them is concerned (weight issues don't apply to bitcoin, of course... ;-) ).

No, you're right - it doesn't.  But I think I've probably taken a more realistic tack.
I've been pushing on New Egg for awhile.  I send them my receipts from Microcenter twice a year or so.  I'm sort of semi-retired from geekdom, but I still do some consulting, and spend some money.  I've bought 38 motherboards this year - and everything that goes with them to make them function.  That represents four separate contracts for office computing environment assembly, and two small apartment buildings wired up for internet so the landlord can advertise free internet to his prospective tenants.

I live in the US, and I use USD day-to-day.  Sometimes I go to the UK - and then I need British Pounds.

Now... mostly, I live my financial life on the internet and I use Bitcoin day-to-day.  But sometimes I go out into Meatspace in the 'hood, or take a trip to another city - and then I need USD, just for walking around money.  Gas and food.  Like that.
So I trade my Bitcoin for USD.  Still following?
Because the money you use depends on where you are.  Maybe it depends on international borders, and maybe it depends on other things:  politics, point-of-view, and so on.

In response to your question in the OP:


I think your best course of action is to bring in somebody who's a fair amount more familiar with the ins and outs of bitcoin than you are.  For example, this:


...has no validity at all.  AT ALL.
No offense - but you really don't have a very good understanding of it.  If your goal is really to help adoption, you need to be capable of standing back and looking at the impact your lack of knowledge will have.
Hire a pro.

How relevant is Switzerland to bitcoin adoption, actually?  It's more representative of the 1%, with the fifth highest GDP per capita in the world (and after such obvious outliers as Qatar and Luxembourg).  While bitcoin - to me anyway (and apparently to Satoshi: see his note in the genesis block...) - is made for the 99%.
We've practically made a cottage industry of pointing out how impossible it would be for a country to effectively ban or outlaw bitcoin.  There might be some value in objective verification of that, no?
And meanwhile, of course, Germany's position is exactly the opposite.  So there would be comparative metrics a'plenty.  In the field of economics, one really doesn't get too many opportunities for that kind of comparative data generation.
Some country somewhere was going to ban bitcoin:  that's pretty much a given.  A high-profile country like Switzerland doing it will resolve the matter much more quickly.
I say let 'er rip.

It's been tried more than once.
The Amazon cloud platform (is it still called EC2?) doesn't earn as much as it costs.
Unless you have a long history of mining experience and plenty of ASICs, the most efficient method of generating bitcoin is to buy them.  
Except you should run a little ASIC single in solo mode off a Raspberry Pi to support the network.  You could get lucky...

I've never used CampBX.  They appear to have a very stable and secure platform - albeit quite low volume - but they are also totally wrapped up in regulation.  They're bureaucrats.  And there's only two kinds of bureaucrats:
The kind who look through the rules until they find something that lets you do what you want to do, and...
The kind who look through the rules until they find something that says *you can't* do what you want to do.
CampBX appears to fall into the latter category.

Forget Wikipedia.  Go back to the mining forums on bitcointalk from late 2010/early 2011, when this was an every fifth thread topic of discussion.
AMD's sales were only slightly affected by bitcoin mining.  They were aware of it, and commented, but it wasn't worth their time or money to pursue the bitcoin market.
And if your premise (That AMD created bitcoin???  Really?) were even slightly true, they would own the ASIC market now.  Right?  I mean,,, it's not like they couldn't bury all the comparatively tiny players in the ASIC space right now.

You don't even need that.  Look at the model being used by *all* of the ASIC vendors:  Offer their machines right on the edge of ROI, then delay delivery while they use the machines for themselves; and once ROI is no longer possible for the customer, ship it to them.
You can do that with current - and even *last*-gen mining equipment.  Just adjust the pricing accordingly.
Really, the ASIC vendors are just miners who sell their used equipment in advance to suckers who think they're going to get what's promised.

There are no wallets with 600k BTC in them.  The largest I'm aware of has a bit over 110k.  So there is no single-wallet problem.
There's not enough information yet on what the FBI has, where they have it, and so on.  I'm not even marginally convinced that DPR had that much in BTC - near as I can tell, that's just an estimate by the FBI.  You know... the folks who (along with DEA, and all other LE orgs) report drug bust values by using per gram pricing for by-the-ton pot busts, and so on.
But if the FBI has his wallets, they may not be able to break the encryption, but they can almost certainly fire up the client and see how many BTC there are.  And *those* BTC are tied up legally.  So, as for spending the money from behind bars; I don't think that'll be easy, unless DPR has a stash somewhere the feds haven't gotten to yet.  If he does, spending it should be trivial.

New commodities create new wealth.  Consider the U.S. Gold Rush of the 19th century.  Or the uranium rush just after WWII.  These were both essentially new - gold because a new source was discovered; uranium because there hadn't ever been an actual use for the stuff, other than watch dials.
But most especially, think of oil.  The bane of real estate agents world-wide - up until about the turn of the 20th century.  Another - essentially - new commodity.
The analogies I'm making may not be precisely exact - poke holes in them if you like - but new commodities haven't come along recently.  For me, they work...

...are **all** common constructions *specifically and solely aimed at diminishing another person* without a willingness to hear what they have to say.  Was this something I was indulging in - and therefore deserving of this kind of comment?  No:  I was agreeing with the OP and noting an addition (in agreement) to his/her point.
Secondly, I read that Wikipedia article, and note that, of the dozens of paragraphs in it, *single* quotes are only mentioned once (see note [18]), and *sneer quotes* (my usage) are noted as requiring a citation.  As sneer or irony quotes, however, a single quote appears acceptable even to Wikipedia.  And having learnt our language almost sixty years ago - and having witnessed (at times incredulously) how it has changed over the years - I'll stand on my usage (as I stand on differentiating between *blond* and *blonde*), and on how I was taught in my degree program (Minor) back in 1975.
And thirdly I find libertarianism to be without much merit.  My mention of gouging was clearly - and only - a reference to Square's swipe fees being too high, and this:

I think you're right - where the big retailers are concerned.

Everybody's tax situation is different.  I filed long-term capital gains last year - it means nothing though, where you're concerned.
Even aside from the fact that non-accredited people giving tax advice lay themselves open to any number of perfectly reasonable legal actions, such advice is almost always guaranteed to be wrong - as situations differ.
If you don't feel like you have the need to hire a tax guy (which you probably don't, for one coin), then ask the IRS - they're usually pretty helpful.
*But* if you ask the IRS, **do it in writing**; so if they change their minds later (which they've been known to do) you won't pay a penalty.

The network doesn't give a shit about profitability, and it's not going to deal with anything having to do with it.
The only thing that's programmed in - that's even remotely what you appear to be talking about - is the difficulty level.  That will go up as miners increase the hash rate past six blocks an hour, and down as the hash rate goes below six/hour.
**But difficulty adjustments have absolutely nothing to do with money, or profitability.**

If I were taking bets - and had a way to verify the answer - I'd say about 95-97% of the sell-off was speculators expecting the exchange rate to go down.  And so... it did.

If you don't like bitcoin for what it is and for the advantages it offers, then don't use it.
If you want a payment system that offers chargebacks, then use one - like VISA.  There are perfectly acceptable use-cases for wanting that, and it's available to you.


What I think about that is that there are plenty of consumer protections in our existing monetary structure.
Bitcoin is structured to provide **vendor** (as opposed to consumer) **protections**.  And we've needed that for a long time.
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:45:02
... *shrug* ...  It's your money.
But I've been doing this since early 2011, and I've developed a pretty good sense of why organizations accept - or don't accept - Bitcoin.
It's got nothing to do with understanding what Bitcoin is, or with how convenient or complex it might be to implement.  Nothing to do with needing a little 'push', or some magic number of upvotes on a website.
Not any more.  Not after all these years of people just like you or I hammering on them *via* websites, email, polls, and even personal contact.
It's about fear.  Just that.  They've had their chances and I have no more time for cowards.  We'll move on without them; and if they want to catch up, it's up to them.
And in *some* cases - where these companies have actively tried to hurt Bitcoin and promote those entities (NSA, Apple, Wikipedia, &amp; etc.) that would destroy it - we will, I hope, remember.
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:54:28
They don't actually own them.  They are evidence in a criminal prosecution, and there are laws which pertain to that status.

Oh, I agree - regulations are a harder problem in many ways, in many places.  But it isn't as simple as you would have it.  Consider:
ATMs are banks, basically.  And all the bits that go into those ATMs are patented.  Last I heard, banks aren't huge fans of bitcoin.  I expect there to be as many IP problems with these bitcoin machines as there are with reverse-engineering software.
I suspect that if these machines are to become ubiquitous, they will have to be completely fresh designs.  That's hard - especially as the easiest design routes are all taken.
And regulatory issues are likely to be quite painless in some places.  Germany comes to mind, obviously; but there are others as well.
I don't really see the overarching regulatory difficulty that you appear to.  A foot in the door is what it takes, and the dominoes fall.  But I don't see the mechanical simplicity that you do, either.  Maybe it's because I've built machines, and been through the process - design and legal.
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:39:51
I think bitcoin is probably not for you.
And that's OK.  Nothing in all of history that has changed the world in any noticeable way has spoken to every human on the planet in the same way at the same time.
The unusual thing about this particular revolution is that it won't violently destroy what went before, I don't believe.  So you'll be fine with PayPal and VISA and the approach to money that you've always taken.

Basically, Dwolla went into the bank accounts of exchanges that were doing business with them, and took out money - a *lot* of money - without telling them; to cover losses due to fraud.  That, after contractually promising that they would never institute chargebacks.  It killed Tradehill, and seriously hurt Gox.
I believe it's still working its way through the courts.

D'you know what that quote of yours is?  Exactly?
That's what people said about Skype.  And yet... who made Skype work?  Who gave it its success?
Pretty much the most technologically lacking segment of the Western Hemisphere's population:  a bunch of farmers and not-particularly-well-educated transients from Mexico, and Central and South America.
Skype was the flat-out cheapest way that undocumented (and even documented) immigrants into the U.S. could maintain contact with their families:  and those families were *very* lacking in tech skills.  Look at the adoption curve of Skype some time...
So while I may be leaning on potential just a bit, I'm really looking at history, and at what's happening right now.

Well... it would certainly make it bigger.  Probably not by as much as double.  Good reason to do it first with an alt-coin, I guess.
But seriously:  what is 'huge'?  Right now the blockchain runs somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 Gb.  3 Tb hard drives cost around a hundred bucks - and a decent cable internet pipe runs about $50-75.
I just can't think of a 10 Gb blockchain as particularly unwieldy.  And by the time it gets too big to be called 'wieldy', I expect efficiency layers to be implemented.

Megacoin looks like it will be implementing Zerocoin - or perhaps something similar - that will provide actual anonymity.  At least the dev is working on that, full speed ahead.
Anonymity won't be showing up in bitcoin any time soon, for several reasons - the biggest two of which are:  wanting to play nice with regulatory agencies, and hard fork.
The alt-coin that offers real anonymity will satisfy your requirement that it offers "*something Bitcoin cannot*".  And that coin will become very useful.

I was unclear about my kids' book made-up words comment.  I suggest they are *useful*:  I *don't* suggest lifting sentences verbatim from any published book - but those nonsense words, and how to find them in the text using pre-agreed labels (one-time pad usage) can be valuable.

That's a very expensive hardware compromise, that could really only be considered for specific, high-value targets.
Not that your concern is generally misplaced.  I'm sure there are plenty of compromised chips out there.  People who appear to be in the know suspect IO chips are most at risk:  network, bluetooth, serial... like that.  Try to avoid built-in IO on your motherboards - and build your own computers.
Probably the best way to secure against chip-level compromises is to control the packets that go in and out of your network; using snort, pfSense, and so on, on an internet-facing guard computer.

Gold is sort of finite.  Bitcoin is *strictly* finite.
Gold is tangible.  Bitcoin is *much* easier and cheaper to transport.
Gold has many uses (although most of those are better handled by other, cheaper materials).  Bitcoin - as you say - "...has one use and one purpose.".  That's not strictly true, as bitcoin is both a commodity, a protocol (which has other than purely financial uses) and a currency - but close enough.  Consider that there *are* advantages in such specialization.
I don't think bitcoin will replace gold.  But I *do* think it offers many advantages over gold.  One important advantage - to me anyway - is its comparatively benign impact on our environment.

As another poster in this thread pointed out, the fee is adjustable - and in the three years I've been seriously involved with Bitcoin it *has* been adjusted.  It will be again - down.
But never lose sight of the fact that without mining (which I haven't been doing for a year and a half), the network grinds to a halt, and we're all screwed.
Don't be greedy.  Don't be cheap.  Pay the fees with a smile on your face - it's why Bitcoin works.

If you withdrew that much from any bitcoin-related site (like an exchange) to - **specifically* - the BoA, the first thing that would happen is that they would put a hold on your money for six months.
The second thing that would happen is that the IRS would be at your door.  Literally.  Keep in mind that transactions of over $2k are subject to setting off alarms that go straight from banks to the IRS - and that more than $10k/month from a single account (no matter how broken up during that month) goes *straight* to the bank's fraud division and the IRS.
I wouldn't even consider cashing out like that.  Not for a second.  You withdraw a quarter million all at once and you'll probably wind up paying $100k to lawyers - and then short-term capital gains on top of that (which would be due on the spot).
Try a different plan...

He got stomped on pretty hard by the G.  Still fighting in court.  If you do this you're a money exchange:  anonymity is not permitted.

I like off-blockchain wallets.  I use one myself (Bridgewalker) for day-to-day purchases with my phone.
But making the price difference visible has been difficult - in fact, until quite recently, it was illegal to advertise price differences between cash and plastic; thanks to our friendly neighborhood Master/VISA lobbyists.  At the moment merchants can offer cash discounts, but I don't know if they can advertise that.  I'm not sure what the exact status of it all is at the moment, but I still don't see any advertising out there...
We'll see.

You could do that.  And it'd certainly make following the money a pain in the ass.
But I'm pretty sure that all the alt-coins out there have a blockchain similar to bitcoin; in that the transactions are public and available.  So the money *could* be followed.  Theoretically, anyway.  I'll have to think on that.

I reconfigured all my GPU miners and sold them as awesome gaming machines, mostly around Q3 of 2012.
I didn't get my initial investment out, but I probably did better than anyone who tries to sell a two-gen old ASIC.
And besides, I sold most of them to my kids' friends - so I got Old Guy Points.
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:15:48


Yeah.  What a strange business model mining hardware has become.  I don't believe I've ever seen its like.
The only thing that makes sense for an ASIC vendor is to:
a.) Advertise pre-orders that appear to have a positive ROI from the date of promised delivery.  And
b.) Delay delivery and use them to mine for themselves until the window for the customers' Positive ROI has passed.  Then
c.) Ship the units once they're in negative ROI territory to prime the pump for the next-generation units that will theoretically make a profit.
Rinse and repeat.
The only mining units it makes sense to buy any more are two or three-gens old - bought used at a price calculated solely on ROI.  And those are starting to become available.
But seriously - has there ever been a business model like  this?

As far as I can tell, the answer to really long-term data storage is the LP record.  Those suckers have lasted for a long time, and will last for a long time more.  I have records that are 85-90 years old, and they play fine.
I note that back in the 1970s we sent out a couple of space probes (Voyager) with information cut into gold-plated disks in that format, with instructions on how to build a player...
Cutting edge tech will march on for the next hundred years, as it always has - and it's likely that there won't be any easy way to play a CD in 2113.  But there will always be record players.  Of course, analog to digital translation might be iffy; but still, easier than trying to get a CD to work.

@_date: 2013-09-16 23:59:44
Yeah.  It's weird.  I've done that too.
I sold a few at the last spike at around $230-240 - not because I'm smart, but because I wanted to have a little extra dough to play with.  "What have I been doing this for, anyway?"
But when it went back down to $60-70, I was crushed for a couple of days - until I thought about it...  "Wait!  I'm still up stupid from where I got in.  It just doesn't matter..."
It was at that point that I started to become a much more effective trader.  I don't day trade; I'm more month-to-month, or week-to-week if there's an opportunity.  But freeing yourself of that worry makes all the difference in the world.

Sure.  I'd pay quite a bit for the first mined block of 50 - that would be the block *after* the Genesis Block (which isn't avaialble).
One of Satoshi's, I'd imagine.  To keep it as is would be the trick - you'd have to get the private keys transferred rather than just get the BTC sent to you:  you'd want the *Mined Block* icon in your wallet, not just a pointer in the blockchain.  But I'd trust him not to rip me off.

It's not FAAIIIRRRRR!!!
It was announced publicly before it was released.  Open discussions about bitcoin began many months before that announcement.  It was not pre-mined.

I've been using Coinbase pretty much since they started up, without a problem.
Just use two-factor authentication.  n.b., Coinbase is nice in that they don't require Google Authenticator for two-factor:  I'm not much of a Google fanboi.
In answer to a couple of your questions, I see Coinbase as very stable, and very competent.
Standard caveats:  don't leave anything (fiat or bitcoin) on the web for longer than it takes to complete a deal.  Manage your own secure wallet on your own computer, and keep your fiat in a bank that will make your loss good if it's stolen.  *Learn before doing*:  the info is out there...

Sounds like the balance in your Qt wallet is made up of a bunch of really tiny inputs ("dust").  The fees for sending are more than the balance, in many cases like that.  Have you been getting BTC in teeny tiny bits from the faucets, and stuff like that?

Gyft cards are pretty cool.  I've used them and I like them.
That said, it's important to keep in mind that the retailers (Target, etc.) have a crapton of gift cards out there - and they probably don't know what the breakdown is as far as how the various cards were purchased.  Which means they don't really have the information to look at bitcoin and say:  "Oh!  Maybe we should take that directly, and keep Gyft's cut for ourselves!"
And of course, it wouldn't make sense for Gyft to be sharing that information, or pushing bitcoin on the retailers:  they'd kind of be cutting their own throats if they did that, no?

Just keep in mind that it's a pocket-money wallet - it's not intended for large amounts.  The transactions use a centralized server:  good for speed, as it's off the blockchain - but a little weak for serious security on the level of, say, Armory.  I have no problem with keeping a hundred bucks or so on my phone in Bridgewalker; as much as I'm comfortable with using any other decent Android wallet.
