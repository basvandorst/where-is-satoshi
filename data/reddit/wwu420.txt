I placed an order with this fellow, my money was "seized" at  the U.S./Canada Border patrol as he tried to bring it into Canada to exchange it. 
He acts surprised that they seized the money when he REPORTED the money as he went over the border, also he said it wasn't even his... Kind of gave me a whole SOL attitude too when he first notified me that my considerable amount of money was seized due to his own fault.
I'm looking into this matter and will either be attempting to get my money back from the border if he is telling the truth, or, use other measures to recover what he "lost".

I naively gave his associate a sum of money  who had a signed contract that I signed.
I agreed ahead of time it'd take 24-48 hours for the coins to trickle in due to him having to get the money to the "miners". I learned after he had the money that he would be going to Canada with the money (sure, no problem I guess, I've had people had to take money into there before).
He tells me he's on his way to Canada, cool. Get a text at 10 pm saying "do you have documentation for the money?" after I decline to provide documentation he starts to tell me how he declared it and it got seized and he "has never had this happen before". (He later says this was the 4th time he's done it, but first time over 10k.... What the fuck are you doing trying to do an exchange?) Call him, "can't answer I'm in bed". Ummm, you just lost all my money and you can't even answer my phone call?
I don't understand how his minimum is 25k-250k and he has never done his methods with over 10k... Suspicious to say the least. I have his associates license plate # and am  looking into contacting them if the money is not truly at the border. Either way this was 100% avoidable and pure negligence on their end.
