Nah, when I was a vendor in 2013-2014 I needed to compete with other vendors. I switched to bitcoin to avoid PayPal fees, passed the savings to my customers, and sold more product. I made the same profit, the customers paid less, and PayPal got the shaft.

I think that your best bet is to just put up solar panels wherever you can. In my state, with tax credits, solar panels pay themselves off in 6-8 years. Let's say 10 for arguments sake. That means that every year you get 10% return on your investment for hundreds of years. That's insane returns! And really it's better than that because energy prices will rise but you will have locked in those kilowatt hours at current prices.
If you want to go large scale and you don't have the money, do it on a bank loan. As long as your interest is &lt;10% per year, you will be able to pay it back with your savings and thus never spend a dime of your own money.

A gold atom is a cluster of 79 protons. That's all there is to it. We can make a gold atom in several ways: by lobbing alpha particles (2 protons and 2 neutrons) at smaller atoms to make them bigger, and by breaking up larger atoms. Soon we will be adept also at manipulating quarks so as to allow us to convert neutrons and protons into each other. Now we only have to wait until it becomes profitable. We can make gold now, and we have done it, but it is currently more expensive than mining it. Once it becomes affordable to mass produce it ourselves, and it will, then gold will become much less valuable. I give it 30 years.

Caution - Environmental rant ahead:
The world is being destroyed by overconsumption. We are in an extinction era, animal species are dying wholesale. The ice caps are melting. We need to stop buying things we don't need. 
Before fossil fuels were harnessed, items were hard to make. But now we can make things easily. A factory can churn out thousands of staplers a day and no one has to work hard, for example. So we have created a consumer-economy where we make junk, buy junk, and then throw the junk in a landfill, and then dig new resources to make new junk. It has to stop.
Its not a virtue to have bad money that devalues. Better to save, buy nice things that skilled craftsmen have created, and preserve our natural resources.

Gresham's Law: bad money drives out good money.
No one will spend their best assets when they can spend their bad assets first. For example, I would spend my 40% gold coins before I would spend my 100% gold coins. The ancient Greeks noticed this phenomenon. If debased coins were produced by a king, then those coins flooded the marketplace as everyone was dumping them.
Does this mean that gold wasn't a currency for thousands of years? Not at all. Because it was actually a great currency, people held it dear and simply spent other stuff when possible. 
So the quickest way to make bitcoin the most popular currency would be to make it terrible so everyone wanted to get rid of it like a hot potato. A slower way will be to let it be great and just wait for the other currencies to fizzle out.

I predict that gold and silver will be produced in laboratories/factories in less than 100 years. For one thing they are just balls of protons so as the price of lobbing alpha particles together comes down, it will be cheaper to mass produce the stuff.

Gold is a ball of 79 protons.
We can make it, and we have. In fact we make it everyday as a byproduct of nuclear fission (although these particular gold atoms are unstable due to the number of neutrons they have).
We can also make gold in the lab through other manner of nuclear chemistry. Just like we make other elements like Technetium and all the other man made elements we enjoy.
Right now, making it by hand is not cost effective, but it will be. No doubt about it.
My 6 year old son has a poster on his wall showing all the quarks that make up protons. He knows more about it than almost anyone over 40 years old. His generation will be playing with quarks the way our generation plays with electrons. Turning neutrons into protons will be child’s play in a generation. Unless, that is, we are assuming that all technological progress will stop forever this weekend. Gold will become a plaything of the poor with no real value. Kids will make it in science labs, just like they extract globs DNA from strawberries in middle school labs these days.
Also, much gold in circulation is phony. It is other metals coated with gold. 
Plus, just like fiat, banks allow multiple people to “own” the gold in their vaults with the assumption that not everyone will claim it at once. 
Also, if this guy is saying that dogecoin is effectively also bitcoin because it is also a crypto, then that is no more correct than saying silver is effectively gold because it is also a metal.
But, actually, I wouldn’t spend much time arguing about it. You can lead a horse to a common sense argument, but you can’t make it actually use common sense itself. It’s up to the horse. When the horse is ready, it will stop acting obtuse on its own.
This guy has a job to shill gold. He’s not interested in entertaining ideas about its coming pointlessness. But yeah, between you and me, I wouldn’t expect gold to become a whole lot more valuable before decreasing.
Copper may be a better investment. It will take much longer to be economically feasible to make copper. Copper will probably triple in price before gold. Save your nickels, as they are actually nickel-plated copper and are already close to their metal value. Pre-1982 pennies are worth saving too. Imagine if you bought $1,000,000 worth of nickels and copper then doubled in price...

People do this all day long with every currency and every commodity.  For example I buy stocks and cryptos when they are low and sell when they high. 
One time I bought a bitcoin and sold it 7 days later for $500 more than I paid for it!
But.... if I just held onto that bitcoin and sold it today, I would have $2300 profit instead. So I would have had to buy and sell a bitcoin for a $500 profit five times to beat just holding it and doing nothing. Next year one bitcoin could be $10,000 and so just holding until then could be better than 25 of my trades.
So, holding has it charms

All ownership is fictional. Can a man own land? The land was here before man claimed it. Can I tell a tribe of people to leave a land because I own it now, because I paid some government some gold for a piece of paper. And the government owned it by virtue of claiming that they owned it and killing people who disagree? What exactly is ownership? All ideas if ownership are abstract constructions that are only valid in the context of a manmade law. 
Thus owning bitcoin in our society is no different than owning intellectual property in our society, or anything else. In a court, the best argument wins. If a lawyer argues convincingly that a person owns a bitcoin, and the judge agrees, then it is settled. There is no higher authority that we can appeal to. It is no different than an invention that one owns the right to when there is no existent prototype in physical form.
Now our friend, Donald Trump, asks a similar question. He asks “can I use offshore accounts and shady real estate deals to hide money, so that I can claim in court that I don’t know anything about Russian and US mafia money that I helped launder.” Ultimately, our friend Mueller will have to argue in court regarding this matter. Mueller will look for clues and show them in court. Our friends Manafort and Gates just got busted for something similar. Seems that Manafort left a paper trail. But there are other types of evidence that can be used. 
So ultimately, it’s up to a judge and the judge will be open to many types of evidence.

Coinbase can do it but after making a Coinbase account, you then want to make a Gdax account which will use the same Coinbase username and password. Send the bitcoin to the gdax account and exchange it there for money. There is no charge to send bitcoin between Coinbase and gdax. Then route the money to Coinbase and then your bank account, or maybe you can drop the money right from gdax into your account.
Basically, gdax is coinbase’s exchange. If you sell on Coinbase they charge you an extra fee compared to if you sold right in gdax yourself.

Quantum entanglement will allow blockchains all over the galaxy to be in perfect synchronicity. Eventually, schrodinger miners kept at -273 Kelvin will allow all blockchains to remain in every conceivable state simultaneously until someone checks their wallet balance thus triggering a Bose-Einstein condensation into a single blockchain. Ultimately, of course, 4th dimensional probability nodes stored on linked photon agglomerates traveling at light speed will allow transactions to be logged before they even take place.
So, no worries.

Exactly. Where I work a lot of money is riding on the line with every bit of paperwork I churn out. Spelling mistakes are not acceptable. To you it is a joke because you have never been in a position of such responsibility. 
 
The 2x agreement is a joke and treats other people's assets like a joke.

Don't know about others but if legacy price lowers, i will buy more legacy chain. Bitcoin's value comes from decentralization. People who don't care about decentralization gonna just use visa.

Let me check my crystal ball:

Unfortunately, Gemini is not available yet in my state :( so I can't give a fair comparison between the two exchanges as I've never actually used Gemini yet.

More people in more countries are gaining access to bitcoin.
Few people are selling.
Institutional investors are buying.
Political leaders are failing and people are looking for safe havens.
Probably some other reasons too.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:01:08
lol, yeah the 2x support is seriously misguided.
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:04:30
Ah, but there is still no one decreeing the value of bitcoin except the market.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:00:38
Yeah, good point!

How about donating bitcoin to a charity for kids and challenging fiat lovers to match your donations.

You can import or sweep a private key, no problem. It has a function for that.

Well, whenever the price hits an all time high with an increment of $100, someone on will post a meme about it.
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:09:25
Is this it?
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:48:45
Heck, I'll sell a bitcoin for a million bucks right now, you don't have to wait 20 years.

Interesting. I always assumed it was a combination of Hiromi SAto, TOSHIo NAKAnishi, and Ayano oMOTO in an attempt to sell more jpop albums.

It's natural to spend your bad money first.
Let's say you have dollars, pesos, rubles, and yen. And you want to buy coffee. You would spend whichever one you treasured least or that you think will decrease in value  most over time. So I might spend rubles, and hodl dollars, pesos, and yen.
Does this mean dollars are not good? No, it means that I think rubles suck more than dollars.

Happy for them. They are doing good work with Gemini.
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:01:24
Makes sense. You don’t have to charge interest since it already appreciates in value.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:29:46
May the Fourth be with us.

Price seems pretty good at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:59:25
As OP stated, they are already using Western Union which offers "Send $50 for only $5."
Now that makes bitcoin fees seem pretty low.
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:20:34
The price will never get too high because you can always buy a divisional amount. 
I don't see it as competition. Why should the super rich have crappy fiat riches? They should have real wealth that increases in value naturally without needing the destruction and exploitation of the earth to sell generic goods in a consumer economy. 
Simultaneously, the poor have a reason to save with a deflationary currency so they don't regret not being able to buy the tchotchkes and schlock that the richies are not pushing on them anymore.

There are reasons to believe bitcoin will be more successful than coins that don’t have good coders working on them and that are managed by known scammers who still tell falsehoods. Pretending this isn’t the truth so that some people get burned financially doesn’t help the crypto community. I would rather have a person’s honest opinion tjam not. If someone didn’t give their honest opinion, what would be the motivation to ask them any questions about anything?
@_date: 2017-07-08 03:03:24
Prices will go up due to demand until the last bitcoin costs all the remaining fiat in the world. Problem solved.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:59:22
I. Gemini, Coinbase
II. Yes
III. That's not a good method. Better to use condoms or birth control pills.
IV. Breadwallet
V. There's only one kind of bitcoin. After August first there may be 2 types. Segwit bitcoin will be the decentralized one resistant to government control.

I love that first price check in the morning, when you're still groggy and it's hundreds more than when you went to sleep.
