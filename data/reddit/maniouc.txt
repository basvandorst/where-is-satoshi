Well I've been calling them all day man. Went to the branch and they told me we can't do anything about it. I contacted LBC and they told me the same. The question is how can the bank let a payment of 2800$ pass with no question asked. Can you tell me the steps to do man im lost this is a lot for me.
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:16:05
Yea just did that, I was dumb and wanted the $ quick since it was very high. he sent it within minutes... and had good feedback.
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:04:18
Did not contact them yet. I've been on the phone for hours and visiting the branches to figure out wtf is going on. but what can LBC do... the btc is out of the account. I did not know that. First time last time. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:57:51
But if he payed from a hacked account will it still be a problem? 
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:00:43
Its because of the cached data. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 06:13:07
Never said LBC is bad. Users behind them like "squirejim" make it look bad. LBC is a great platform my 1st trade with another big trader went smoothly and I wished he was online and would of traded with him instead of that piece of shit. I was on the phone with the bank when the money he deposited into my account reached the account and asked them to confirm the legitimacy of the $ and they told me everything looks fine good to go. At that time I released the bitcoins and 10 hours later everything turned to shit ! :( Idk how can people do that to others and ruin them

Turned out pretty bad. Spoke to a good and nice manager who surprisely holds bitcoin too. She was on my side and I brought all the information possible to show that I have nothing to do with that. She called the fraud department and they kept saying "the recipient intended to receive funds that are used for money laundering and drug money, he intended to receive fraudulent payments". She tried to fight my case but they were stuborn about it. My account will be closed and my money is frozen for 5-10 days now. The etransfer will be returned to the sender and I have a note following me around now. I am in tears. I was doing a fair trade with honesty and ate shit. Can someone tell me what to do??? I am lost.
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:27:59
Yup. Do you think LBC support can do something about it ?

I added the webcache of his profile in the description on top : 
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:05:57
doing that now thanks
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:57:56
No way to prove im not responsible and get the money back ? Like a dumbass i said I sold BTC for the 1st time and they told me the bank might close ur account...
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:15:38
kraken.com, gemini are both good options.
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:44:23
learned the hard way. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:14:08
Im heading back to both branches and talking to those managers. I'll try to show them evidence that I am not trying to defraud them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:04:12
Your last hope I believe is contacting Binance and ask for a manual Removal of 2FA. Gl bud! Im still short 0.1 btc cuz i did the same with coinbase and im lazy to send my IDs
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:45:52
What payment method did you choose? 
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:25:43
Etransfer? Hope its not a hacked account.
Read my post that I made. Stole from me 2 BTC and closure of 2 bank accounts due to a fraudulent etransfer.
@_date: 2016-09-30 16:00:11
How can we trust this and make sure its not another bitbulls scheme ?
@_date: 2016-09-19 04:08:57
Instacoinatm.com put cash and get Btc straight to your phone.
@_date: 2016-09-11 08:14:36
I usually go with cloudbet.com (real time dealers)
@_date: 2016-09-19 05:56:44
Try those guys with money order from Canada post?
Canada post does not require ID if its under 3k$

Don't get scammed. Easy to chargeback those transactions.

For storing either a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor.

They do not allow bitcoin transactions. They might limit the buyer...

You don't have to but I had to go to my banks to close my accounts lol. He f me hard. They did not want to do business with me anymore cuz i sold bitcoins. I could of said I sold 2 potatoes and they would have never done anything like that.

No cops will show up. They told me to file a police report and basically go fuck myself because they let pass thousands of dollars without verification.

So if UASF comes in place what are the outcomes for the hodlers ? It's been bugging me cuz im hodl quite a bit and dont know what to do.
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:50:23
Your cash is long gone. File a police report, that's all that LBC told me and they froze his account but it had 0 Btc inside so... also visit your branch and ask to speak to a manager and show them that you did nothing wrong even though they wont do shit.
Banks don't like btc and they won't cover you. They will tell you to file a police report also. The f*cker will prolly still be on the run and nothing is gonna happen which is sad. Sorry to hear that bro.
