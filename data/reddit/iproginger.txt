Reddit is down for a while at least twice a week. Not a big deal.

Mining. Although the work required makes it hard to mine unless you're in a pool.

Well, it would be interesting to be able to tip, say, 5 or 10 karma.

That's almost $100. Someone needs to readjust for the current btc price.

Lot's is a contraction, meaning Lot is.

You might find some basic info [here] ( It's not 'profitable' in the sense that you may not be able to spend the bitcoins now and still get a gain. But, if you plan of just getting a few coins to sit on, it may be a good way to (slowly) build up your supply. I mine on my gaming rig when its not in use, and make about $30/mo.

Everyone panic sell! The bubble is popping, get out now!!!!!!!!!1!

Wasn't it 1 mBTC before?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:01:34
Exactly. I see everyone talking about how we need to take traffic away from mtgox, but that move starts with you. If you don't like how mtgox works, or how much of the market they control, go trade somewhere else.

Because then it would be easier for another fork in the blockchain to happen.

Any proof?

Ever considered making a herb grinder for the kind of 'herb' everyone is used to?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:56:42
Was kidding, but I agree they're not very reliable.

Not anything in particular, but I figured would like these if they had a 'pollen catcher'.
