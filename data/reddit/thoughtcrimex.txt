they also have other technical difficulties: 
But according to the support, it's a banking problem.

This wall is nothing to be afraid off. This guy is not a trader or has any insights. Just an average guy who put around 400K in BTC exactly 2 years ago. He has not done anything since back than and is now cashing out for 10m. I probably would have done exactly the same. For an average guy there is no additional benefit in having 50m instead of 10m - but there is a huge difference in having only 2m instead of 10m.
I hope the wall will stay till my deposit arrives on Bitstamp.

Holy shit. Long term holder just deposited &gt;30K Coins to an exchange!

Snapcard is unusable for Europeans. Simply not working and way too high fees.  
The bookmarklet is not working on amazon.de  - js coding error resulting in an infinite loop

I've seen guys depositing 30000 BTC into this shady exchange's hot wallet :-)
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:25:06
Well they could keep the site running and just disable BTC withdrawals, 
so people would be free to withdraw their fiat...

It's the only reliable info I found, sorry. And it says that its very unlikely they will be up again tomorrow...  so 2-3 days is a good guess I think.   Do you have a better source?

No I never read what I link to. 
Likelihood of bitstamp being online in 24 hrs was ~25%.  If you assume the same probability for the following 24hr periods, 2-3 days was my guess to go for...
