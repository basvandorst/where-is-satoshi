I've had a few people smirkingly post "Bitcoin crashing!" at Facebook. The usual suspects - sour grapes who keep repeating about "Bitcoin is in a bubble and is sure to crash" from months ago. 
Showed them the graph of its price in July of $2,000 ("Ridiculously expensive! It will crash!"). End of the smirking.
Too bad for those who had bought at the recent high. But many people had faced a similar situation. As recently as just a few months ago. Especially during that period when BCH rallied while BTC went the other direction. 
This is part and parcel of cryptos. If one doesn't have the stomach for this kind of movements, he should put his money in Treasury bonds and similar.

Very possible. After seeing how successful BTC had become, he could have decided to come up with another crypto. Based on how big he had been on "decentralisation", he wouldn't have been against alts popping up. Instead of BTC being the one and only cryptocurrency for everyone in the world.

From the link: One of the very earliest people who had known about the bitcoin project was Sepp Hasslberger. Sage words indeed, coming immediately after Satoshi had first published it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:33:51
Too close to the time after BTC was launched. If I were him, I'd likely do the new coin project after BTC was solidly entrenched. Maybe during the time when the BTC Core devs and community started to become fractured.

Besides "Tulip Mania", there's also that comparison used by out-of-touch mainstream financial journalists and anal-ysts: "The price of Bitcoin has far exceeded an ounce of gold!"
This is much worse than "Comparing Apples to Oranges". And why compare with an ounce of gold - why not a kilogram of it instead?

I had created that Segwit wallet last January but have yet to use it. I sure hope the exchanges like Binance, Bittrex and Poloniex would use Segwit. And lower their fee for BTC withdrawal. 0.0005 BTC is too high.  
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:29:27
If I'm not wrong, you need to create a new Segwit wallet with Electrum.

A lot of truth about "regular people" and I'm one. I'm in Malaysia and follow developments in all things crypto fairly closely. I had read quite a bit about the negative aspects of Coinbase, especially at Reddit. 
But the most grating thing for me, a regular guy, is this: I can't use Coinbase because it doesn't offer services in my country. Regardless of whatever negative comments against it, I'd gladly use Coinbase if it's available here.

A significant percentage simply don't care about these abuses. Things like privacy etc. are totally unimportant - as long as Facebook is free to use, and they can keep in touch with assorted friends, relatives and strangers they call 'Friends', they don't care.

Me too. I'm in Malaysia and had been rooting for England since the early 70s. Repeated heartaches when it comes to football (especially those failures to even qualify for the World Cup in 1974 and 1978). But made up by the successes in cricket and rugby of a few years ago.

Still not too late, Nocoiner.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:58:26
Yes, can’t fault the exchanges at all in this case. They released the cryptos since the specified withdrawal procedures had been followed. I’d say the plaintiff must shoulder a significant part of the blame if he didn’t fully utilise the security options that were available.

Will have to wait for the specifics. But based on the tweet, I'd say this is the biggest, most important development in a while for Bitcoin. This is what's missing at the moment - an easier way for the non-techie to participate in LN.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:36:35
A bit off-topic: I’m old enough to remember Napster. It was so revolutionary, of people storing and sharing files on a global scale. But it was rather easy for the authorities to bring it down.
However, bittorrent is a different matter due the decentralised nature of things. The Pirate Bay is a great example. Its website had been blocked by ISPs but it still lives on. If the user has a good VPN service, he’s all set.   
And now cryptos have expanded on this with something that offers freedom and protection of one’s assets. Many don’t see how important this is yet. But the prudent will learn about and use cryptos, in addition to fiat. As a viable option to survive should the authorities freeze and block his access to the fiat system, for whatever reason.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:21:59
This is a very good exclamation of the sharp upward action.
@_date: 2019-10-31 07:45:38


 The choice that Bitcoin and cryptos provide to everyone - this is precious. If some/many/most people don’t value this and don’t want to take it up, then it’s their choice to do so. But the rest of us do. And I must add that it’s comforting for me to also have the choice of Bitcoin.
THANK YOU, Satoshi and to everyone who have participated and contributed to providing me with this choice.

Cynical comment, but definitely possible and worth scrutinising.
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:33:28
It was too hard for me also; in Malaysia, with Ringgit and without a credit card. I had installed Multibit or something wallet on a laptop, but that’s as far as I got. There were local websites for buyers and sellers but the quotes were unattractive, and one had to trust the buyer wouldn’t renegade after receiving the payment. I decided it was too risky.
Thankfully a very reliable service called Luno appeared, and I made my first buy last July when BTC was at $2,200.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:21:02
This makes sense. Better to have BTC in one's exclusive control than fiat in an account that's frozen/suspended.
BTC is like US dollar (the real one, not Tether). One can easily convert the latter to whatever other fiat he wants. It's also not difficult to convert BTC to fiat. The only question is "Price".
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:38:25
Yup, better than one party having to fully trust the other, and risking being played out. Would need a third party to hold in escrow. A smart contract might be better, of course, if someone can create this. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:18:33
If that's the case, what are the Bitcoin supporters doing about it? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:38:34
Bittrex has BCH (although they list it as BCC). As does Binance and HitBTC. The last two don't seem to care where we are from if we are using cryptos, not fiat, to trade.
By the way, despite using Bittrex for most of my trades (90%) I have tried the last two also. Their interface takes some getting used to. But more importantly, their withdrawal process - I didn't face any problems.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:13:22
Roger Ver being involved with Bitcoin.com and is one of the proponents of BCH is a well-known fact. Is there anything malicious about that?
The second part about the dump and me losing out - this is merely speculation. The same can be said of bitcoin reaching $7,700...and the correction we're seeing now. Are these planned by anyone?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:02:44
I have high regard for bitcoin and everyone involved in it. But I'm going to look after *my* interests first and foremost. If BTC looks to be undergoing a significant correction, the sensible course of action is to take profits. Certainly not to add "just because it's bitcoin". 
Yes, it might rebound and even create new highs. But I'd rather wait for it to at least find solid support and create a new base first.
As it now stands, BCH is in the limelight. Especially with the Bitcoin.com people moving exclusively to it. *This* is something new which wasn't a factor in the previous bitcoin price drops. At the very least, take this aspect into consideration when making the decision to add and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:24:41
XRP has its place. But dominating cryptos?... NO!
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:04:10
The Coinomi android wallet can help with this. HitBTC is a good place to send the BTG and sell. Binance's price is higher, but it's futures if I'm not wrong. Can't send to this exchange.
It's at $135 at HitBTC. Quite a good price I'd say. For free coins from a fork which many had been dismissive of.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:31:09
So counter then. This is the freedom of action I'm talking about. Come up with the Asics and mining power, short BCH, buy more BTC, among other things.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:48:13
We will never know about "the right price" until after the fact.
 I'd go with the above strategy too, but with some variation in the quantum. I prefer to split the buying into 4 stages.
I bought my first fraction of BTC at $2,200 in early July. It went down to 2,000. So I bought another quarter from the allocated capital. Then down to 1,800 - another quarter. BTC started to go up after that. Once it passed 2,200 I made the fourth buy.
Based on my experience over the months since then, averaging works. Not just with BTC but with the alts too, more often than not.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:41:02
I was very slow to realise the implications. Had seen the BTC price in Ringgit at Luno.com being at a premium of around 9% over spot. Had thought about transferring some and converting for fiat. But my transaction will be delayed too.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:59:45
I had a problem with Bittrex a few weeks ago. My account was suspended/disabled. For no reason. I was already verified (am in Malaysia, and had sent all the documents when I first registered).
That matter was resolved in less than 24 hours. But it left me rather shaken. I decided to move most of my coins to wallets that I have the private keys to. Leaving only a small amount to trade. Plus looked around for other exchanges. 
Cryptopia also looks good. I have an account there but haven't used it even once. The volumes tend to be low though.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:08:54
The "If only I had..." - it's unending. Thinking about things like this too much and we will end up with a mental problem. How are we to ever know the future?
Be grateful for what we have. Even during those times when our buys went south. Learn lessons from our mistakes, let go and move on.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:19:48
This would go against the spirit of freedom of action and letting market forces decide.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:20:19
Me. And it's in my interest to see both BTC and BCH do well. Frankly I don't care much about 1MB, 100MB  blocks, Segwit etc. But the price in US$, which is then converted to my local fiat (Ringgit) - this I care very much. Because I need the latter to pay for food, fuel etc. (neither BTC or BCH are accepted by the shops I go to, unfortunately).
So, why does it have to be one or the other? Why can't we have both...plus a few more?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:17:19
"Supposed to be" but isn't yet. Have to see bitcoin and alts for what they really are at the moment - a commodity. This might change in the future in that bitcoin becomes an alternative currency and is more often used as such. But it isn't there yet.

Or how about converting the heat to some sort of battery, and later using the power to light up the house, for the fridge etc.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:51:57
Sure wish some genius could figure out how the generated heat could be utilised. With a simple-enough and elegant contraption (the great inventions tend to be these). I had seen videos of people in cold places utilising the heat. But there are surely other uses, regardless of geographical location.

This premine was CLEARLY mentioned by the proponents. As with the quantum and usage of the minted coins, including lock times.
There is nothing wrong in people trying to make profit from their effort. *You* can work towards creating your own coin too.
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:01:07
It's a very good idea actually. This is how I had made my first buy of BTC when it was so difficult to get in my country then. Since then, other escrow services have appeared to provide alternatives to LBTC like my current favourite, Remitano.
With all these services, I decided to register and only deal online with those with high rating scores. Plus strictly follow the tips and advice at LBTC and these other services on buying and selling BTC.
After a few dozen transactions, the worst experience I've had was one where I had to wait almost 30 minutes for a BTC seller to respond after I had transferred the fiat to his bank account. But with the others, the response had been within a minute.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:35:19

@_date: 2018-11-21 02:52:49
Selfish and self-centred, yes. But better to protect our individual interests first over everything else. It's always a good thing to lock in profits when they come. This ensures we have capital at the sidelines to take advantage of future market action.

It feels like around late July 2017 again, after that sharp decline earlier. This time around $10k will be the psychological resistance. It might need a few attempts before it gets broken again. But it will - this is a level which BTC had gone past before.
The period after the Chinese New Year tomorrow will be interesting. This time around I have the feeling it will be like Sept-Oct 2017: investor attention will be on BTC and a few major coins. After the recent sharp fall, investors will be more selective with the cryptos they buy.

@_date: 2019-01-07 03:16:13
[Quote]"of people getting letters from their bank telling them they either suspended the account or threatened to suspend it because they were converting fiat into crypto."
Or converting crypto into fiat.
These are among the things that banks in many countries do to severely discourage people from being involved in cryptos. They also make it almost impossible for crypto exchanges to have a bank account.
The banks would get on a high horse and claim their actions are related to "protecting customers", "against money-laundering, funding terrorism" and such. Sweeping statements, even when there's no reasonable cause to indicate any wrongdoing.
Banks will only allow cryptos if they can either get a cut of the action or to control these. Since they aren't, they will continue to make things very difficult for everyone.
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:55:31
I'm with you on this. I'd take profits when they come progressively, at different price levels. And convert some to fiat. It's comforting to have money at the sidelines even if it "isn't doing anything". Because there will be those times when the market gets panicky and prices tumble. Having money ensures we will have more options on what to do.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:01:45
Likely. Despite the drops, I don't think we're at the capitulation stage yet. There will be small rebounds but there's likely more pain ahead.
In the meantime, I'm sticking with Averaging. Buying some at current price, and selling during resounds. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:45:51
Yup, my broken dreams... I first came in at $2,200 last July. It’s now only at $8,500.

This has always been an intriguing speculation. If you had just started it and have some units, how would you have tested the program's sending and receiving functions to see how well they work? Me, I'd send to my own address first to see what happens.

This needs to have more visibility. More and more people are getting into bitcoin and cryptos. 
Most will use whatever addresses their Android/iOS wallet gives out, which is a good thing. But some trying to learn more about generating their own might end up with a costly lesson if they were to use this link.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:34:42
The good thing about BTC's price action is that it had gone through quite a number of corrections. During my short time speculating in it, I have seen two significant falls. And some thought "That's the peak. It may have burst..." and took their profits (or cut loss if they had come in later).
 It established a bottom each time when other speculators/traders came in (I don't see it as "investment" because it doesn't provide any dividend/interest unlike POS tokens/coins). Then it retraced the fall AND posted new highs.
I believe it will go on for a while yet.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:16:27
Sometimes I’d find crypto posts at Reddit rather tiresome. Especially those repetitive “My preferred coin is the real deal, unlike your shitcoin.” And then I’d come across informative posts like this, which justify the time spent trawling through the site. Thanks.

Most of the transactions involve people trading and hoarding. Myself included. A few weeks ago, had thought about using it to pay for my subscription at AirVPN (they accept quite a list of cryptos by the way). But decided to pay with fiat via PayPal instead. Fortunately as it turns out.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:48:27
Same as me and many others.
In my case it was from several months ago. I have some experience with the stock market so it's natural to come up with this smug assessment: "It's an obvious bubble and will burst soon..."
But the darn thing kept going up!
Then I read something that makes sense: even if it's a bubble, who can say what the peak is? The sour grapes who didn't get into BTC (and regretting it now, for sure) love to mention "Tulip Mania". Like they were around when it happened :) The thing is, even with that event, some people had made a lot of money - those who took their profits and didn't get back in. It will be the same with BTC...if it's indeed "in a bubble".
Anyway, I finally decided to risk it during the price correction from late June-mid July. Entered at $2,200 (ignoring the mental block of "But it was only $1,200 some months ago!" - would never buy with this kind of thinking). 
But I used only a quarter of the intended capital. Which was just as well because BTC went down to 2,000 and then 1,800. I bought more at those levels. Felt vindicated when it started to go up from July 17.
We will never know what BTC's peak is...until after the fact. It might be very near, or this is actually only mid-way or even not yet a quarter of the way. Who's to say?
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:05:25
Most of my BTC is at Bittrex while the rest are in a Electrum client, Blockchain.info android app and Jaxx wallets. I don't have much when compared to many people. But I can't lose them. I will transfer those BTC to one of the wallets (probably Electrum) very soon.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:50:05
I sold some for USDT when it was at $4,200. Had to scramble to buy back at $4,500.

I've been reading tons of posts and comments at Reddit bitcoin and btc subs trying to have a better understanding of Segwit2x and what it entails. While this comment may not have provided all the answers, it's definitely the best in the sense of being most passionate. 
The writer is definitely biased towards one group. But it was written from the heart. And that creates a significant impact on me...so much so that I'm now leaning towards "NOSegwit2x".   
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:43:34
Had thought we are now well beyond that phase of “It’s a scam!” Not everyone has BTC or other cryptos. But anyone who does just basic research will not make a statement like that. Best to just ignore those who still claim that it is. Admittedly it might also be fun to ask him to show why it is so (and smiling while hearing the purported ‘evidence’ of “ponzi, pyramid, greater fool, governments banning it” and such).
I feel the much bigger concern now relates to scammers using Bitcoin and cryptos as bait for various schemes. Plus in many crypto users not appreciating the importance of keeping their cryptos in wallets they have full control over. And not at exchanges, despite the fee to transfer.

Almost the same as my first purchase in early July. It was 0.026. Bought at Luno.com with Malaysian Ringgit. I think BTC was $2,200 at that time. It went down to $1,850 after that and I bought more with the same amount of ringgit. Definitely no regrets :)

I'm trying to do something similar and really appreciate the tip.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:45:06
One use, including for me, is this - using Bitcoin to buy the altcoins/tokens. Some are project-related. While having these tokens doesn't legally make one among the registered shareholders as with conventional companies, it does provide an avenue to be involved in the early stages of development. And possibly profit in the future.
Some of these are genuine investments, risky that they are - the ones with Proof of Stake (POS). The holders who stake get a certain percentage.
Right now it's mostly speculation. But there will come the time when things reach an equilibrium and stabilise. When the potential for capital gains as per fiat currency is mostly reduced, many holders will start using the units they now hoard. That's the time when Bitcoin becomes mainstream with its use worldwide. Just like US dollar now.

Putting one's head in the sand is a strategy, I suppose. But is it smart?...as with hodling when it was $19k, and then when $16k doesn't look like support anymore?
Protect one's interest, first and foremost. Which includes knowing when to cash out and stay at the sidelines. And buying again when the trend shows signs of being positive.

I'm new too. But I have some years trading in the stock and futures markets, and with gold and silver. One aspect remains the same for anything: we don't know the future. 
Therefore, I'd try to increase my chances of success (and minimise possible losses during those times I'm wrong) with this general strategy: split my intended capital for something into 3 equal parts. When I've decided on something (including bitcoin), I will limit my first phase of buying to the initial one-third. Not necessarily all of the one-third capital in one shot.
Bitcoin is around US$2,240 right now. Will it go up or down after the fork? I don't know. But have to also take into account that won't be the only event that will affect the price, as we had seen again and again. But just use up one-third first. This way, no matter which direction it goes, you are covered. "It goes down"...? Well, you still have the other two-thirds with you. That gives you the opportunity to decide on what to do next.

They aren't getting enough attention, unfortunately. I've heard of them since the last quarter of 2017, went to their site and was intrigued. But we don't hear about them often enough which is a shame.

Thanks for sharing. This is how we learn - from others and our experiences and observations. In retrospect it's easy to say what one should or shouldn't have done. But living in a certain moment is different, especially when Bitcoin and exchanges were rather new.

Sound advice. All of us surely have that "I should have..." for dozens of things. Including with bitcoin. When it dropped sharply after the sudden rise in the later part of 2014 or so, I "should have bought". It was for the taking for months at around $300-400. But the "I'll buy when it's below $200..." resulted in me being a spectator.
So it's the "second best time" as you mentioned - now. Even if it's now 10x the price in 2014. I'm averaging with the purchases - up, down...just buy with cash that I can afford to lose should things not go my way, without getting into serious financial hardship. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:20:17
Sorry to hear that. I hope the amount wasn't too much(?) But the fact that you're still around in the crypto world is heartening. "How we respond is more important than what had happened" seems to be correct. 
Some people might remain extremely bitter from that experience. Can't blame them though, especially when seeing the huge appreciation in value over the years since then.
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:14:21
Yup, ironically. "Forced hodlers make huge profits", if you get the BTC back or the dollar equivalent from the liquidators.

This explains why they have become more welcoming in wanting new users since a few months ago. No more minimum deposit but "everyone is welcome".

In many countries, even the less developed ones, more and more people pay by scanning QR codes with their phones. And there are also contactless debit and prepaid cards where they don't even need to swipe. I can't see how customers and especially merchants will see Bitcoin as being preferable to this. Even if Lightning Network is common (which it won't be anytime soon).
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:18:20
Thumbs up and good luck.
This particular aspect is critical. A service that protects both buyer and seller will be welcomed.

Sounds a lot like me too except for a few things. For one, I'm in Malaysia and, for now, I see Bitcoin more of a commodity that could also be used as a medium of exchange. Like you, I feel that I need to explore it (and other cryptos) instead of totally dismissing them as mere fads and experiments that will just fade away over time.
At the same time, for prudence's sake, I am allocating just a certain percentage of my money for Bitcoin. Even if it were to go to zero, I will only be exasperated and not face any sort of financial difficulty. 
I have to say that I'm more of a speculator and trader than 'investor' with Bitcoin over the past 1.5 years. Whenever there were good profits when converted to fiat, I'd take them. And use the proceeds for the nice things in life like travelling, buy an iPad and such. Just like how I approach companies listed in the stockmarket.
The involvement in Bitcoin has been beneficial because I've learned a few important things, besides being comfortable with it. For now, I don't see how it could be a viable replacement for the likes of PayPal just yet when it comes to buying online. Among other things. But I want it to continue being around, improve and be more widely used throughout the world. It will certainly provide another option for everyone in terms of diversifying assets. Having choices is always a good thing and I'd want some of my money to be in this form.
I look forward to the day when I could send and receive "money" seamlessly over the internet, in Bitcoin or whatever crypto, and able to use it at the neighbourhood sundry shop. There are many smart people working on things like this right now and I'm fairly confident we will see various improvements in the near future.

For those who value anonymity above crypto ideology, they wouldn't care it isn't bitcoin.

"Low" can always become "Lower", as shown over the past 11 months. 
In due time, cryptos - particularly Bitcoin - will play a significant role in what the world see as "money". But right now Bitcoin is clearly in a bear market as per fiat. And the national fiat is what we work to obtain to help facilitate our daily living. This is the  unit of account and medium of exchange now and the foreseeable future. Therefore it's disheartening to see the value of one's Bitcoin units depreciating here and now as per fiat.
Regardless of how convinced one is of Bitcoin's future, it's not prudent to go against the trend. Yes, it might go back to $20k and, who knows, way higher in the future. But here and now is no less important. I will definitely add to the Bitcoin units I have. However, this will only come when I'm reasonably sure the trend in price is reversing. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:36:44
The premium is rather high depending on the country when it comes to BTC conversion from US$ to any given currency. In Malaysia where I am, it's usually at 6% or so above the Forex spot price of USD/MYR with the best (as far as I know) exchange, Luno.com. But the good thing is that one could also sell at a premium. So I guess it somewhat evens out.
But I sure hope exchanges like Coinbase, Blockchain.com etc. will finally expand to my country. That will help drive down the premium.
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:05:30
The volume on many of them is extremely dubious. Like ZB.com and such. They try to make as if they are significant players, and thereby attract the gullible to open accounts and send in their coins to trade. Sites like CoinMarketcap etc should ignore the claimed figures from these sites.

How easy is it for a significant percentage of the population to GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES...?
How many percent of the wealth in China do you think is in bitcoin? And to those who do hold bitcoin, how are they using it to pay for various expenses? Maybe a few people might pay with it at the even fewer places that accept it...and then tweeting about "increasing adoption of Bitcoin in China!" after paying $10 worth. LOL! 
No, it's not about the Yuan being a 'shit store of value' as you erroneously claim. As with practically all other places, they had converted SOME of their fiat to Bitcoin as a commodity to speculate on. In the hope that its value will be significantly higher when they convert back to fiat...which they are and will be using to pay their way in life. And this 'shit store of value' - tell that to the Chinese who had bought Bitcoin around this time last year. I'm fully sure they'd rather have that 'shit store of value' back if they could turn back the clock LOL!
'India has always been a GOLD country' - you mean the people there transact in gold? It's obvious you aren't aware of the fact it's mostly a CASH economy. That is, a significant number even get paid directly in rupee paper notes. Sure, some people there do have Bitcoin. But again, like in China, how many percent of wealth is in this? I'm betting INSIGNIFICANT when compared to the value of rupee in circulation.
'2 billion unbanked' - you mean they will be totally unaffected if the bank accounts of others in their country are frozen? They don't live in isolation - when those accounts are frozen, there will be a lot less work and business for them when the account holders can't get access to their own cash.
"Those who need Bitcoin" - and who are these beyond those in countries with raging inflation and capital control? For the rest of the world, things work fine enough with their country's fiat. What reason do they have to convert their wealth to Bitcoin and move to another country - just because their government makes it difficult to buy and sell Bitcoin? LOL! That's definitely not a reason for any reasonable person to take such drastic steps. Not even 'crypto bugs'.
Face the fact: Bitcoin can be useful in certain situations. Personally I also hedge some of my money in it for prudence's sake and "just in case". But I wouldn't bet against the fiat in any country that is in reasonably good political and economic situation. For it has the power of government behind it. And a country's government can do A LOT of things to protect the status quo.
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:49:07
Good idea. This provides one more option for those who might be in that kind of situation. I believe most of us are living in "normal circumstances" albeit in different countries. Therefore we have the luxury to choose various ways to store our cryptos. But I feel it's a good thing to also consider contingency plans in case something should happen. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 12:55:49
Thanks for the explanation on the public key types, and the link about brain wallets being insecure. I had done a bit of research into this and am aware brain wallets are risky. However, it's something that I also need to consider in dealing with various situations and contingencies that might arise.
For instance, for a refugee/migrant or anyone who risks being thoroughly searched and have his visible assets robbed by criminals or seized by some government authority. A hardware wallet may be great security for someone living in a normal situation. However, its presence would alert criminals that the person/victim has crypto assets that could be worth thousands. They will definitely be strongly motivated to force the person to reveal how much is inside. That's a horrible situation to be in - the person doesn't know if he will be released or killed after his cryptos are robbed. 
It will be a different situation if he doesn't have anything related to cryptos on him. No hardware wallet or mobile wallet on his phone or anything of this nature. He might have his fiat and valuables taken away but the perpetrators don't know about his hidden cryptos, if in the form of a brain wallet. And the value could be much more than the physical assets - something which he will extract and convert when in a safer situation. 


Yes, this is a lot more secure than a brain wallet. Unfortunately, I don't trust myself to remember 12 words, and in the right sequence too :)   However, I'm trying 3 words, but with a passphrase, using a saved copy (offline) of the mnemonic page. The creator did warn about less than 12 words not having enough entropy. On their own, 3 words will quickly be cracked. I'm hoping the passphrases will help provide significantly more security. "passphrases" - same seed words but different HD wallets. 
It's true these are less secure. But at the moment I can't figure out a better way to go about it in facing the situation and environment as mentioned above.
@_date: 2019-05-03 01:48:29
That's an achievement. Somewhat. Many others are limited to only producing a _picture_ of a yellow glove and coloured stones.
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:44:24
Don't know whether this question is relevant or not but I'm going to ask anyway:
Whenever we create a brain wallet, two sets of private keys are produced - compressed and "another one", with the associated public keys and addresses. How is this so, please?
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:45:24
I'd go with this: password-protected paper wallets. My next-of-kin would know the likely password/s, but they don't have access to these paper wallets now.

Many, if not most, online transactions by ordinary people and businesses using fiat are within their own country. These are almost instantaneous and tend to be free. In many cases, there's no fee even when the sender and receiver have different banks.
This service is almost 24/7. Many banks tend to suspend the service for 30 minutes or so at midnight for administrative purposes. Which isn't an issue for most users since the suspension period is routine.

This is an important factor to take into account. There will always be all sorts of workaround to buy and sell cryptos, especially Bitcoin, as we have seen over the past few years. In most countries at present, there are various obstacles and limitations that make the exchange of cryptos difficult. For many users, it has become like a game of cat-and-mouse.
Despite the bans and obstacles, no country has actually been draconian yet in their response. Not even China, despite their much-quoted "ban on Bitcoin" last year. It will be different should governments view cryptos as becoming a serious threat. Then we will see the screw turned progressively as governments try to contain this threat (real or perceived). 
One rather easy way for governments to put the squeeze on crypto adopters is through the banks. They will freeze the accounts of those suspected to be dealing with cryptos, and thereby creating a lot of problems for those affected. That will create fear among adopters and trading volume of fiat/crypto will see a sharp reduction.
One big reason for the sustained interest in cryptos is the ability to go from fiat to crypto and vice versa fairly easily. Even if one believes cryptos are the future, he needs fiat right here and now. Forget the cavalier talk of "dying for liberty and freedom" - for most people, if their access to the fiat system is threatened, they will yield to the people controlling it. Unfortunate, but that's how things are. 
So, back to the main point quoted - we'd want to be onside with the government when it comes to cryptos. Even if a government can't control Bitcoin, for example, it sure can make things very difficult for the crypto's proponents in that particular country. It's always wiser to try and engage with policy-makers and smoothen things instead of being loud and confrontational.

I have no doubt about that, of some people's ability to memorise. But not yours truly. On a late afternoon last month, I was puzzled to see my wife ironing some nice clothes (hers and mine). "Where are you going??" The annoyed reply: "WE are attending X's wedding reception tonight. Don't you remember?!" Apparently not :-) Therefore I should do myself a big favour and avoid future headache by not biting more than I can chew LOL!
Writing down: this is what I'm doing now, in "a normal" situation. In the abnormal situations as mentioned, the notebook will likely get through. Or it might not, depending on the person checking. Over time, more people are getting aware of cryptos. Plus of recovery phrases/seed words. An eagle-eyed foe will likely be intrigued by a series of 12, 15, 24 words. If he knows about cryptos, he can conclude what these are. Or the words might intrigue him enough to detain and interrogate me on these. 
There's also this real problem - the notebook might be destroyed or lost. Quite a number of spy movies have this scenario, resulting in heroes and villains doing all sorts of things to try recover. 
There is one other way though whereby one doesn't have to physically carry anything: online storage of an encrypted folder/volume containing the seed words. The person only needs to remember his login details and also the encrypted folder's password / passphrase. When in a safe environment, he can recover this and thereby sweep his wallet. Just to be on the safe side, he should also upload the same encrypted folder to another online storage as backup.
