Yes there is, but if you're factoring in human psychology (aka TA) moreso than they are, you should be winning more. Even if it's just 51%/49%, you use anything you can to gain an edge.

Put quite simply, TA tries to draw human psychology on a chart. Easy examples are double top reversals. If an asset gets sold down twice from the same price, do you suddenly want to buy it in hopes that it will suddenly break through? No, you wait for it to break above, or wait for a lower, safer entry. Thus, double tops can be hard to recover from.
How about descending triangles? Btc bounced off 6k and went to 11.8. Then back to 6, where it bounced again and went to 10. The back to 6, where it bounced to 8.4. Then back to 6 where it bounced to 7.4. Then, back to 6 where it flatlined before breaking down to 3. Consider why: People keep buying 6k because it gave good returns in the past. Each time it gives less and less, so the buying becomes less enthusiastic. When it's clear there's not enough interest to go up from 6 again, people give up and sell. Enough sells breaks the price down, and everybody scrambles to sell below 6k (5.8 i think was the actual number) because the 'support' is broken. That creates a flood of new sell pressure that drove us down to 3.1 rather quickly.  You can see the same thing happened with the ETHBTC ratio recently. 
This is just sentiment, but it can be drawn on a chart as a triangle. It'll never be exact, and it'll never give 100% accuracy, but it can be used to make informed decisions.

Money doesn't buy happiness, but in a way, it does buy time. I'd love to spend my life traveling, opening businesses, and learning skills. I can't do that, because I have to spend 50 weeks/year working.

They absolutely are. There are countless bots constantly on every exchange. They arbitrage between coin pairs, or exchange differences.
As a result, when one exchange or coin drops or rises, the rest tend to follow suit almost immediately.

OP wasn't talking about depth, and he said the price would move 1% ($95). So, you're making different arguments.

Let's simplify.  If one guy holds the entire bitcoin supply, and refuses to spend or sell any of it, then the supply is effectively 0.  Suddenly, he can buy computers, clothes, pay bills, etc.  All the coins he spends are immediately liquidated.  Yes, there are the same amount of coins in existence, but now there are more available for purchase.  Thats the supply I'm referring to
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:57:01

@_date: 2014-12-19 16:49:53
Supply is also increased due to the increased merchant adoption.  People now have a place to SPEND the bitcoin that, in the past, they would have held onto.  Demand may be down, but realized supply is certainly up more than just 18%.

Better report that donation, son
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:15:04
Right. The coins that are spent through bitpay are for the most part sold for USD.  I would expect that to put non-negligible downward pressure on the price, indicating that demand isn't *necessarily* down, it just isn't enough to keep up with increased selling pressure. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:38:14

He means that if you put the one month's worth of UBI ($1200) for every citizen at the current price, there would be no bitcoin left to sell

That might be in their best interest now, but when users start jumping ship, will they wake up? 
If bitcoin development stalls, it will steadily lose market share (as it has been) until all of the sudden, mining is pointless anyway.

You sound very uneducated.  Is your beef with New Jersey, or with tolls?  Because tolls are not a New Jersey thing.  Jersey has great water, some of the most highly rated towns in America, beaches, mountains, farms, and cities.  It also provides easy access to Philadelphia AND New York, if you need a "big city experience".  
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:55:58
$15 + $15 never equals $65.  The tunnels cost $12, but only one way.  So round trip is $12.  The traffic is bad during rush hour...so don't go during rush hour.  Or take the train...it's cheap, and reliable.  NYC has a metro system for a reason.  There's no need to have a car there.  You have no idea what you're talking about, but it seems NJ is better off without you.  Good riddance, my friend.

The psychological factor. People see that a bitcoin costs $1000 and they think "wow, I can't afford that." For every $1 they put in, people would rather have 1 mBTC than 0.01 BTC. It just sounds better

Thanks, I'll make a paper backup once Armory finishes syncing with the network (8 hour ETA).  
Another question: I transferred 1 BTC to the wallet address I created on Armory, but it isn't showing up (presumably because it has not synced yet).  Can I rest assured that once Armory is all set up, that 1 BTC will show up?

I guess I was just lured into a false sense of security.  I thought I had his personal info, and he had 100% positive reviews with a healthy transaction volume.  His buying price was better than the cash adverts.  Greed can lead to dumb decisions, I guess
