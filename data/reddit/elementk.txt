Most tech companies disregard resumes if you don't have a diploma or degree in computer science or the like, unless you have years of experience already. 
I know we do. I was part of a hiring process today, and it was the deciding factor with our applicants. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:10:11
I noticed this too.. It's possible they haven't completely updated their website. I already notified them that their "Deposit Funds" page also needs updating.

That thumbnail...
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:44:14
I don't see bill payments or interac... screenshot?
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:31:13
Already did :)
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:46:04
Good thing you had a screen protector!

Just wait for a reply. I got an automated reply saying the following:

Fair enough, but the purpose of many altcoins is to offer things that bitcoin will never adopt - often fundamentally different designs. They serve their purpose, bitcoin serves its. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:26:28
So far? Better reputation. Do a search into past posts on about both companies.
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:12:44
Oh :) you had me excited

What kind of mask were you wearing? I might like to get one for winter camping, I sleep in a hammock and the cold air is killer. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:11:47
It sounds like you'd prefer a monopoly...
It's not competing standards, it's just competition. 
Dilute investor interest? How so? By having too many choices for where to purchase BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:22:07
For sure. But CaVirtex has higher fees, slower customer service, slower verification times, no altcoins, and they take your CAD if you leave it in without trading for a certain amount of time. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:33:58
It's also possible that you can only buy/sell BTC in USD, which means in order to buy and sell BTC with CAD, you need to exchange:  
CAD -&gt; USD -&gt; BTC -&gt; USD -&gt; CAD.
And of course each exchange takes a chunk of your money.

Nice! Mind if I ask how much you got for the domain?
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:31:33
Haha, figured I may as well ask. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:49:50
Good point. I'm just curious what the prices will be like...
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:50:16
To be fair, you could say this about anything that hasn't failed completely yet.

It doesn't specify when he needs to eat the hat. Therefore he can eat any hat as long as he owns it before eating it. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:32:03
I didn't actually reply to it yet because I don't want to buy until the Canadian trading opens up. I don't want to convert CAD-&gt;USD.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:59:13
I use VOS too, and they're great, but history doesn't always repeat itself and I want to make sure this information can't be used for harm. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 00:44:48
Am I the only one who thinks there's an agenda here, and the design was done on purpose to affect the price? It's just *too* bad.

@_date: 2013-12-02 18:30:58
Maybe you should leave it there with a warning. Even after reading this, I plan on using the service but more carefully. I'll transfer my balance to an offline wallet, which can be done for free on their website.
Also, why aren't some of the major exchanges listed on your website, like gox?
Not to sound mean, just trying to provide constructive criticism.

1.) Shit goes sour, people want reassurance.    
2.) Head over to 3.) "How (insert bad news here) is actually GOOD NEWS!"
 
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:13:35
Too bad you can't do that anymore. You may have been one of the last customers to complete a cash transaction with them.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:52:27
Yeah, all 5 big banks did this same thing to CaVirtex. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:40:19
I saw you made this comment [2 months ago]( and I completely agree, I just thought I'd ask for other thoughts. I personally have no plans to use this service.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:26:58
Go in and ask for an old non-Visa debit card, that's what I did.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:56:30
Why does it say "No Fee" under "Bitcoin Instant Withdraw"?
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:00:22
You answered my question without me needing to ask it, thank you. The rest of the article quote: 
"But as demand for Bitcoin has skyrocketed, the constrained supply has led to a wild fluctuation in price."
So they got it completely backwards? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:26:43
[How about this.](
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:54:49
Is there a withdraw fee for withdrawing BTC into an offline wallet? I assume just the standard transaction fees which is just a few cents.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:31:28
FYI, you can request an old debit card from your local TD bank that isn't a Visa Debit. This has 13 digits and still works with "Interac Online".
QuickBT, just to clarify, you're still accepting payments through TD using this method, right? I just made a purchase with this method and it has been hours without any deposits on my wallet. It says it should take 2-5 minutes, but I see it can take up to 24 hours, so I'm still waiting.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:25:58
Oh, good :)
I was waiting for mine, and it just went through now, too.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:42:32
Why isn't it working for you? If you have TD, they're not supported unless you get an old debit card, one of the non-Visa ones. They have 13 digits instead of 16.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:47:52
Good idea!
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:59:18
It says "what is this" right in the comment. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:45:11
[Let's discuss!](
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:27:19
Really? Thanks for checking. So they're advertising no fees and then they charge fees?? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:02:25
I'm not sure, does that not happen? When I need money, I sometimes sell my assets (old electronics, clothes, etc). Do people not sell stocks when they're running low on cash?
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:31:35
Because confidence increases price. More people buy-in, less people sell. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:15:55
Apparently it failed for cavirtex too, with all 5 big banks. Sorry.
