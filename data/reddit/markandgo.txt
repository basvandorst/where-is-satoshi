It's quite simple to understand. Let me show you an example. Let's say Tether first wants to inject USDT into the market. First seller wants to sell Bitcoin at $11000. Creator prints tether and buys it. Next highest seller wants to sell Bitcoin at $11050. Creator prints more tether because he doesn't care about inflating price with monopoly money. The creator can then go through the entire order book with his monopoly money. Basically it's artificial demand and liquidity.

There was no actual transaction. The printer got something for nothing. They couldn't care less if Bitcoin drops in price from a crash because they got it for free while you got worthless Tether! That is the key takeaway!


No, I'm just saying when they want to inject USDT into the market, it's creating artificial demand for Bitcoin. It's not like Bitfinex is constantly on the other side of the trade.

I like Bitcoin as much as the next guy but what a turd piece. Competition is healthy and it should be a wake up call for Bitcoin devs that Bitcoin is losing market share.

There are futures trading in many commodities that people have no intention of buying like oil, corn, or whatever. All derivatives affect the price of the underlying assets and vice-versa because of the no-arbitrage rule; if bitcoin's price start deviating too much from futures price, futures trader can earn a free lunch by arbitrage so the derivative and the underlying asset should stabilize each other.

Paying taxes is a good idea. I would like a constructive future not an apocalyptic one for cryptos. I hope some of you are willing to die for Bitcoin if you want it to be tax-free. Who am I kidding, most of you would just run.

This. I'm not sure why the other post is so highly rated. It's actually far more revolutionary that banks can issue fiat and the modern world has grown so quickly compared to the world before it with deflationary assets.

China will only be crypto friendly to something it can control. If you're holding Bitcoin in China while the next big thing is ChinaCoin, well... you're shit out of luck.

Gold can be traded for cash under the table. 99% of Bitcoin volume goes through exchanges that can be shutdown by banks. And trading Bitcoins for cash is a massive pain in the ass.

You didn't even read the last sentence. Trading bitcoin for cash will be a massive pain in the ass. Just because it can't be banned completely doesn't mean it'll be successful part of your portfolio unless you plan on hiding in a basement for the rest of your life. Not all of us want to live in complete paranoia.

I know it's hip to hate the USA these days, but the scamming, theft, and fraud in crypto shouldn't be defended.  If Vinnik knowingly assisted fraudsters and thieves for kickbacks, he should be convicted.
