I for one would like to say this is a very qaulity post. Not because I agree but the way he has articulated his opinion.
He hasn't crammed his opinion down anyone's throat, note the disclaimer. 
The thing with investing is that stock prices are an information war. Bullish vs Bearish news. The louder or more substantiated win for that day/week/month. 
This piece is just a great demonstration of that market noise. The market -especially the relative nontransparent nature of bitcoins - is a living organism and there is rarely ever a single reason for a rise or a drop. It's your job as an investor to try and understand as many angles as you can and when the dust settles research which was the greatest contributing factor.
That last point is what separates the men from the boys, objective learning creates experience.

Have an up vote. Many financial geniuses go against the grain based on their experiences. Correct or not they're needed. Same with this guy.

I get what you're saying mate.. I think you kind of missed the point of the post. 
The mentality when your investing is very different to the aim of investing.
Some will get it, others wont. Keep on trucking and good luck!

Think of Apple shares.. at last glance it was USD $550.
The amount of selling required to drop the price of a liquid stock like that even 5% is MUCH more than to drop a $100 stock down 5%. 
The market is much bigger with more well known stocks and there are many more buyers to offset the selling.
