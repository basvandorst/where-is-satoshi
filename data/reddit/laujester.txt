You talking about life and death but don't call someone an idiot  whan he gambles all he's life savings wel living in the netherlands.....
If he lost all his money his family still not have to suffer...
 talking about win a dollar he never have to work again and can spent his complete lif to his family
If you still own btc you thought at the time that btc probably go up more than go down

I think we all live above our needs.
The only thing he hat to do if he list everything is to get a job. Earning more than the average dutchman. Earning more than 80 percent of world population. Just dont call him an idiot because he took some risk. Its not like that he put his family in danger or something...

I like your post butt please dont call the dutch father an idiot because he spent all his money on btc.... 
The worst thing that could happen is that he hat to live in a small rented house with is family....
After all he made the right decision....

He could afford all the losses. I know he gambled. But at that point he didn't have any debts how many of us can say that.  How many of us have a mortgage? I'm just saying it was a risky decision butt  he hat nothing to loose only money. So don't call him an idiot because he takes more risk with something he beliefs in just a little more than you...
Is that so retarted what i am saying?
