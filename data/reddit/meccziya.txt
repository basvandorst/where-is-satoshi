I'm Glad Alex Jones was banned, he should have been banned years ago.  They shouldn't stop with that, they should strip him of his rights too.  I think we need to start voting on social media on who starts getting banned.  We need to starting coming together and letting people know what they can say and wh**[[THIS USER HAS BEEN BANNED]]**

If the funds aren't being utilized, what is the point of a "slow burn"?  You're making things harder than they have to be and at the same time, forcing someone to A) have activity on their account or penalize them.  B) cause all kinds of headaches for users to be scammed by telling them they will be burned if they dont use it.

Dont stop. We should also continue forking until no large wallets exist.  That's a great forking idea!

Banks also charge fees for simply storing your "digital dollars", should we also start doing that to bitcoin wallets??
Why force users to "use it or lose it"?  What difference does it make to you if someone is holding on to a sizeable wallet?
