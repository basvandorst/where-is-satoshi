No matter your opinion on the matter, and I can see why the current form of cryptocurrencies puts you off, the people who created them are visionaries. You may not adhere to their vision, but that's a whole other question.

Litecoin is about contributing to multiple global currencies instead of one only like Bitcoin.
Also, Satoshi is a visionary. Bitcoin users aren't.

Or getting into Bitcoin with the purpose of converting into fiat later, expecting it will rise in fiat value.

Here's a conspiracy theory: you're not the only person who found the vulnerability. Other people are exploiting it to amass bitcoins via fake buying/selling at set-values. This vulnerability is responsible for the spike in bitcoin currency-transfer value. You're being ignored because this bitcoin rigging is part of the plan, and you're not in it.

Calling it a leak of currency is simply wrong. If you acquire Bitcoins with your dollars, the previous Bitcoin owner now owns your dollars and uses it as currency. The dollars didn't leak anywhere, they stay in the economy, as with any other transaction. This kind of misleading hyped-up jargon is just Fanboyism 101.

If cryptocurrency goes to the ground it's because this experiment is nothing but a speculation tool. If anything, other cryptocurrencies will help avoid this. Market competition is healthy. Users will decide which one is best (Bitcoin or another), because they have the option.
