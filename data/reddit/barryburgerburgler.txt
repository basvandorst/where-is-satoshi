Far, far less than required to run our current banking system.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:49:51
I understand what you're saying.  It is you that is missing my point.  Bitcoin is catching on worldwide in fits and starts.  It doesn't matter what the current value of BTC is.  What matters is what it WILL be.  If Indians and the Indian government hold a ton of BTC and China does not, this puts them (China) at a hell of a competitive disadvantage.

You can't say anything to make him look stupid.  Just give it time.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:43:05
This is utter bullshit.  China has limited the investments of it's citizens for a long time.  This is a continuation of that.  They simply don't want the value of the RMB to drop or for their citizens to invest anywhere other than China.

...or you know, something that is gaining in value as time passes, adoption increases and utility bears out.
How long will you stubbornly hold onto your beliefs as you are proven wrong time and again?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:11:24
What you're really saying is, "I bought in at a higher price and I see my money dwindling before my eyes.  Please hold on and buy so I can get out because I'm scared."

That's me.  Me and Bernanke are best buds.  We chill together counting all our money.  I love the guy.

You could spend it...you know at ANY of the constantly growing vendors that accept it or trade it for cash.
Can you trade a Walmart Gift Card for cash as easily?

It's becoming very obvious that governments throughout the world only serve to fuck over the people.

You sent her 7 cents?
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:31:14
Once bitcoin is used to buy things directly the game is over.  The problem now is most people don't accept it and governments can fuck with it by limiting their money flow into it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:53:55
Their perception is wrong.  If they don't open up to bitcoin and the rest of the world does, they will be at a helluva disadvantage.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:58:33
Interesting idea!
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:55:55
It is expanding and being used more frequently in ordinary trade.  Clearly it's not worth 1000 bucks a piece yet but in time, the utility of it will be worth that so that is the speculative part.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:43:04
Bitcoin will not fail because of the blockchain.  The security protocols are nice and all but the blockchain is the real dealio.  
Security flaw comes out, transactions made exploiting the vulnerability are exposed via the blockchain and nullified in new version release....meh.
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:22:11
You don't understand bitcoin yet.  There have been zero thefts BECAUSE of the bitcoin network.  All thefts happen from third parties.
There is NO problem making bitcoin liquid in many nations especially the US.  
Here's what you do, use coinbase.com (the most reputable site).  Create a strong password and use 2 factor authentication--they have to text you or call you before you can login.  Create a secure paper wallet and transfer your bitcoins there.
No problems.

My main point is that I'm lazy as hell.  I just want to scan a QR code at McDonalds, have the total come up automatically and just press send.
They could display that QR code right there where I order my Big Mac and eliminate the first window where they take your cash.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:56:41
Can you explain what bitcoin is and what the bitcoin network is?  If not, you definitely should not invest.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:41:39
The federal government would do just that.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:46:16
If they didn't partner with the feds, they'd be thrown in jail.  It happens time and again.
Still if they did do that, they'd have to compete like all the others on coinmarketcap.com.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:22:43
It would look like a few guys mining ALL the coins and then "trading" them for free goods and services for themselves.
@_date: 2013-12-21 04:37:59
That's awesome.  I just want to press send for my BigMac man.  
Make it happen.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:35:58
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:44:59
Now you're onto something.  If they partner with the federal govt they'd get further.  However, other countries likely would not embrace it.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:50:38
If they partnered with the Federal Reserve, this would be great for them.  Still it would be a currency of one nation.
Also, the only reason it's difficult to get bitcoins is because the govt. is fucking with it.  Coinbase is pretty established but you still can't use a credit card?  Why?  Because the govt. is fucking with it.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:55:25
Let them all compete.  coinmarketcap.com
Even though this site doesn't tell the whole truth.   For instance anyone can make a coin with 100 trillion units then any purchases will make it greater than bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:13:06
Dat boy good.  I tell ya.   Dat boy good!

You guys do know this link doesn't do much to stop panic...lmao.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:25:21
Such bullshit.  You know, if you value true freedom, you know wtf is happening.  At least acknowledge it.  There is a coordinated effort between central banks and governments to destabilize and marginalize decentralized currencies.  
Ask yourself why or if you like being financial slaves to those that have so much to gain and maintain from keeping things status quo.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:14:27
Huh?  Blockchain.info has nothing to do with the bitcoin code itself.  Your crazy is spilling out.
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:47:14
Op sounds like he poisoned the conversation with his preconceived notions.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:44:07
Any one company can be sued, fined and put in jail.  The federal govt. would do just that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:54:23
Your argument is flawed due to your lack of understanding.  The price cannot stay at 250 AND have mass adoption.  
You do know that bitcoins are limited right?  There are only 12+ million now and it aint growing fast.  If you get mass adoption, you get a massive price increase.  That's the way it works.

Honestly the federal government would force them out of business if their money was anything more than coupons that could be used internally at their store locations.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:04:52
I wouldn't risk it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:13:56

Hahahahahaha!  Sweet.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:15:57
It's already happening.  Luck has nothing to do with it. 
Once they realize the importance and potential of bitcoin, things could quickly change there.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:47:35
You're right, a partnership would work if they could pull it off.   Still though, what other countries would want it?  How would it benefit them?  It's not truly a global currency then.  Plus it just doesn't taste right.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:50:31
His intention is to make bitcoin look like a scam.

If you do have an Apple device, tell Apple to go fuck itself and buy an Android.  I hope Apple goes under pulling this type of shit.

Dude I've been in this a while now.  I love bitcoin.  
Your post is NOT helpful.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:48:14
China is not the enemy.  It's not any one particular person that China should be afraid of.  China should be afraid of people using Bitcoin worldwide and their RMB becoming worthless without their citizens or governments having enough BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:19:21
Don't know why we can't snapshot the blockchain daily and run most nodes off an agreed upon hashed base.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:43:47
Absolutely...excellent job!
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:39:38
It's decentralized.  There's no king at the top making more coins at his discretion.
If Apple came out with an open source, decentralized currency even they couldn't manipulate then you may be on to something.
@_date: 2013-12-21 04:25:09
Hmm...I wouldn't think this would be a bitcoin thing?  I would think it would just be the way the apps are made.

I'd say you're a dick that doesn't realize you're being oppressed by people that would have you only use their money so they can keep you from maintaining your own assets.
Just like millions of other fucking idiots on this planet.

Do you believe this is the first crash?  Do you believe the last bubble was the first?
This cycle keeps repeating ad infinitum.  It's a good lesson in human psychology really.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:40:46
How then would this be better for average users than bitcoin.  They'd win some fans but soon folks would see through it.
