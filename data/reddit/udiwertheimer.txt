well, sure, I meant if a miner wants to change the rules, she'd have to get nodes to agree
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:01:28


A stronger chain is defined as the chain that **follows consensus rules** with the most PoW on it. It doesn't matter if there's a "stronger chain" that doesn't follow the rules.


Each node controls its own view. Consensus is achieved when many nodes have the same view. That's all there is.

I'm not justifying the attack, just explaining what it reads like to me.
I explained in previous comment, I would assume that this was either sent personally to him by mistake, or we're missing the context of the rest of the email.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:39:49
Most nodes already do... if you want to change the rules, you're the one who's gonna have to get them to agree
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:37:20


When a miner extends the chain with a new block, he's not so much creating consensus as he's *proposing* a change. Once nodes accept it, it *becomes* consensus. That's by definition of the word consensus, really. Now, if we want to nitpick, then miners are nodes themselves, typically with significant economic power, and they'd be crazy not to accept their own blocks. So by default, every mined block has some consensus behind it already. But as long as there's a significant majority of economically strong non-mining nodes, that's probably not going to be enough.


Well, I can (and will) avoid propagating it myself, and as long as a supermajority of nodes follows the same rules, they'll do the same, and the block will actually have a hard time propagating. But really this doesn't matter, you can give out DVDs with your blocks at Walmart for all I care, they will still be invalid.


They can choose to, but they won't, because other nodes won't accept them and their block reward will be lost.
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:37:40
I'm not sure if you're *disagreeing* with my point, or not getting it.
What I'm saying is that if a chain is considered invalid by your node, it doesn't matter if it has more PoW than the valid chain. Your node will only see the valid one.
And when **many** nodes see only that chain, that's when you have consensus. And that consensus is created around the strongest **valid** chain. Stronger invalid chains are ignored. So my point is, miners don't create consensus, nodes do.

I don't understand why this isn't the top comment. These were my thoughts exactly as I was reading the OP.
It's pretty obvious in my eyes that this email is not specifically about Otherwise it just makes no sense. Obviously the email writer didn't mean that OP alone should "start with fixing the image of Core devs"?
As for why this was sent privately, I can think of 2 options:
Either 1. We are missing the complete email which would explain this,
Or 2. Sender is a complete noob troll who meant to send a public email and accidentally sent it privately to Johnson.
Now, I agree that it's too bad people are sending emails like this to devs at all, even if it's directed at a group and not a specific dev. Just wanted to try and clarify what I think we're actually looking at here.

Even more important than just running a full node (and accepting incoming connections), is to use that node to actually validate your incoming transactions. [Here's why](

Yeah, Colu is also building a consumer app, so the Colu website is probably not what you're looking for.
We just refreshed the website for the open source ColoredCoins project, it's at 
We're still in the process of redoing some of the documentation, but here's the tl;dr:
* We don't provide wallet software. Issuers are expected to build wallet solutions catered to their users. We *do* provide the open-source tools needed to make that easy.
* We have a [dockerized package]( that includes everything you need to spin up your own ColoredCoins node and block explorer API, based on Bitcoin Core (or any other Bitcoin-based altcoin if you're feeling adventurous).
* We also have an [SDK]( that has everything you need to build a wallet. Build your GUI, point the SDK to use your own node, and you're ready to go.
Also, you can see all of our progress on different project on modules on GitHub:

It's really exciting how you guys managed to get Stratis to fund development of new Bitcoin features. You and Nicolas are an inspiration. Keep it up!
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:57:25
A few things you can try:
1. Use a software wallet that supports the Ledger and also allows connecting directly to a full node for validation. GreenBits for Android is one that I managed to make work, there might be others.
2. Manually add a "watch-only address" to your Bitcoin Core wallet *before* each time you accept a payment with your Ledger wallet (you'll have to do that before *each* payment because you'll probably want to use a different address for each payment).
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:48:10
Sorry that this is confusing! ColoredCoins is a platform for issuers, not for end-users. End-users are expected to get support from the issuer (in that case, Mycelium). As a token holder, you're not supposed to care about Colu's products too much, really.
The article that I linked to in the OP includes our opinions about the hard fork, and guidance for issuers and users of the ColoredCoins protocol. If you care about Mycelium Tokens specifically, you should ask Mycelium which fork they're going to go with. If they choose Bitcoin Core, which is what we recommend, you don't have to do anything. But I can't speak for Mycelium, sorry.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:53:56
I can understand the frustration, but I disagree. This is not the time for Bitcoin supporters to go silent.
You say that if when you come back, Bitcoin is a centralized mess, you can safely write off cryptocurrencies as a failed concept and move on with your life. **This is a dangerous approach.** Bitcoin is **not** a technology. It's just a new way for **people** to make decisions together about money, which is radically different than older approaches. It doesn't magically work without people doing their part.
Bitcoin aligns incentives of different stakeholders in a way that *should* make everyone play along. Strong miners will naturally want centralization, and that doesn't make them "bad", just rational. Users on the other hand, want decentralization, and by pushing for decentralization, they are supposed to **make it irrational** for miners to try and take over the network.
So it is now our job, as users, to do our part. Otherwise, miners will be right in demanding centralization and we sure as hell can't blame them.
What will prove cryptocurrencies to be a failed experiment, is if it turns out that users don't actually understand they need to do their part. But this is something you have some control over.
**what can you do?**
* the Bitcoin community is indeed rather toxic. Maybe stay away from reddit for a while? Might I suggest the various Bitcoin mailing lists and irc channels to stay up to date?
* Make yourself heard in places where it matters. Talk to people in your local Bitcoin community about why centralization is bad. Drill down to the details. A lot of people have the wrong misconceptions about Bitcoin and it's not their fault they don't get it. Help them understand.
* Ask Bitcoin companies that serve you to take a stand. Do you live in a country where a small exchange operates and helps you get Bitcoin? Tell them to take a clear stand with regards to the fork, like the major exchanges did. Are you a purse.io customer? Tell them you want them to be clear about their continued support for the real Bitcoin, and that "BTU" would only be supported via shapeshift, like other altcoins.
* Run a full validating node to validate your own incoming transactions. Help others to do the same. This isn't "a vote", it's making sure you're getting the right coins. But be vocal about doing it.
* Who are you? Are you a coder? Are you a business owner? A content creator? Think what you can be doing to help. Contribute.
This is **our** Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-27 17:31:56
The Colu.com website is now focused mainly on our local currency app, which isn't (currently) related to the ColoredCoins project. The Colu Dashboard is still available, mainly so that current customers can take the time they need to migrate to the non-hosted open source dashboard.
As for the mobile app, we currently have no plans of releasing a mobile wallet app that has generic support for all kinds of ColoredCoins, maybe that'll change in the future. We do have some customers that built wallets for their own ColoredCoins assets.
Mycelium already have public plans to add support for their "Mycelium Token", which is ColoredCoins based, on their wallet app. They may add support to other assets if there's demand for that, so if there's an asset that you think would be of interest to a significant portion of Mycelium users, you can ask them to consider adding that asset to their wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:51:18
This is something I've been looking into as well. I didn't find a way to connect breadwallet (iOS) to your own node. And while Bitcoin Wallet for Android allows it, it doesn't provide any mechanism to safely verify you're connecting to the correct node (i.e. to protect against MITM attacks). And indeed, both do not allow using a hardware wallet.
GreenBits for Android allows you to connect to your own node, and has built-in tor support so that you can verify that you really connect to your own node, as long as it operates as a hidden service. It also supports Ledger/Trezor.
The problem with GreenBits for me, is that it still sends all transaction data to GreenAddress (Blockstream), as it's required to do so for the 2-of-2 multisig mechanism to work. So you lose a lot of privacy there.
As for Bitcore, you can use Bitpay's BWS for both Copay, and Trezor's own web interface. It's pretty cool. However, setup is difficult, and by default uses Bitpay's own hosted node. If you want to use your own, they have guides for that, but as far as I can tell you have to use their own fork (with *addrindex*), which they only maintain up to 0.12.1, so really isn't relevant for our case.
I didn't try using Electrum yet, but it seems to be the best option right now. Definitely not easy to use however.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:39:30
The online site you're referring to is  It's still available. We're open sourcing this as well so very soon you'll be able to deploy that on your own.
As for the wallet app, if you mean the mobile app we once had, then yeah, it's no longer supported and you won't find it in the app stores.
There's also a sort of "experiment" we did in the past, with adding ColoredCoins support to a fork of the Copay wallet, which you can find [here]( if you'd like to build on that.
And if you're building something and need some help, you're more than welcome to our [Slack](

I hope you're reading this thread!
Personally I don't think Abra is a scam at all, and I think turning OTC Bitcoin traders into Uber-like remittance operators is brilliant, but there are a lot of open questions that Abra is neglecting to answer for years now:
* how are you protecting fiat holders from Bitcoin volatility?
* how can you do this while having users holding the funds with their own private keys?
* and do the numbers add up? LocalBitcoins traders usually charge steep fees, is this really going to be profitable for everyday people, over using traditional remittance apps?
I've seen many Bitcoin companies ignore these questions, usually because they genuinely "don't get it", or because they try to obfuscate the fact that their plans clearly aren't going to work by throwing buzzwords around. Abra on the other hand, seems really promising and I think the community is ready to rally behind it as one of Bitcoin's true killer apps. I really hope you guys are getting ready to open up and share more details with the community.

People like to hate on Circle for various reasons, some might be justified, but I don't think this is one. Circle wasn't going to make any profit on the Bitcoin price rising. If allowing consumers to buy and sell was a profitable business for them, they wouldn't stop doing that. So I guess it wasn't.
Even if they aren't keen on admitting it, their business is still very much based on Bitcoin. They are now basically an "IM meets remittances" app, and settlement between currencies is based on transacting Bitcoin behind the scenes. So a higher-priced, more liquid Bitcoin is actually great news for them.
@_date: 2016-12-14 09:41:14
That makes a lot of sense, but just to clarify - is it correct to say that what we really want is for a supermajority of *BTC value* to be verified independently by *holders*?
Just running a validating node isn't enough in that sense, if users are still holding funds in "light"/mobile wallets that do not connect to their node at home for verification, right?
I suspect that this is still what many node-running people are doing, as a lot of popular wallet apps do not support specifying a full node to connect to for verification...

It's just difficult to talk about things. In the past when I was speaking to new bitcoin users and trying to explain "the blockchain", I had to begin with "I'm not talking about your web wallet with the same name". Now it's the other way around usually, as they hear about "blockchain" from mainstream media before they get to know blockchain.info, but it's still painful.
The same happens with coinbase, just with fewer people, as there are less people who care about what to call a transaction with newly minted coins. But when someone does care about it, it's painful to explain I'm not talking about a web wallet

I agree, and we plan to do our best to change this. I'm actually fleshing out a plan on how we at Colu can regularly contribute to Core, and I'm looking to see where we can have the most useful impact for the project. I've actually sent out an email to you guys at bitcoincore.org a few days ago to see what are the best ways we can do this, and I'm hopeful we can continue this discussion.


I'll admit I'm not familiar with either pay-to-contract or sign to contract. Do you have any pointers for me to read up on those (in addition to [this thread](


I see. I'll nitpick and say that the transaction fees incentivize *all* miners, and not just the miner that happened to find a block. But I get the point.
Not to come out as selfish, but it's probably best for Bitcoin if it's able to incentivize users to be more mindful about doing things like creating UTXOs that will end up being abandoned. Probably not something to waste time on until it actually matters, but it probably *will* matter at some point - maybe because of colored coins and maybe because of some other reason. I don't think we should just count on people being altruistic. Users can always threaten to use the "ban hammer" and just reject any colored coins transactions if they ever become a problem, but that's probably not going to solve all (or most) bloat issues.
That being said, I agree that we as "digital asset protocol" developers should strive to be more involved than we've been in the past with the Bitcoin project, and make sure we tackle these issues before they become real threats.


I'd like to be optimistic and think that there's a way "we could all just get along" once a central bank chooses to issue a "fiat colored coin", but there are no guarantees for that of course.
Realistically though, we probably have some time to collaborate before interests start to conflict - and if they do, it's totally feasible to migrate to another network whenever this becomes necessary.
@_date: 2016-11-23 01:09:40
That's a very interesting view, could you elaborate?
Are you saying that traditional financial systems are inefficient because the fact that institutions are *able* to both learn identifying information about a transaction, *and* reverse said transaction, *forces* them to regulate transactions?
@_date: 2016-11-17 13:02:57
The Colored Coins protocol is "coloring" outputs by adding asset data in OP_RETURN. An output is only considered valid if the transaction spends inputs with the required amount of colored coins. While miners don't enforce this, "color-aware" full nodes do. These full nodes won't consider an output valid otherwise and would just ignore it.
In our fork, payment channels are created(\maintained\closed) by validating the colored outputs being spent (using a color-aware full node), and use the same mechanisms as the other implementations do to lock the new UTXOs. If anyone's trying to spend these UTXOs unfairly, the "cheated" party has time to set things straight, just as if this was a normal bitcoin transaction (and as far as miners are involved, it is just a normal bitcoin transaction)

Thoroughly reviewed indeed!
Semi-related question:
The Nano S did not pass the 'Does not show "received from" Bitcoin addresses in the UI' recommendation in that review, as the Chrome app does show the "received from" address. Why's that a bad thing? I wonder what I'm missing here
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:56:42
Hey, Udi from Colu here. This conversation seems relevant to what we're doing, so I wanted to jump in.
I feel like you're mixing separate concerns in here.
There's the issue of being an actual "competing" altcoin, which I personally don't care about that much. While protocols like Counterparty and Omni require their own "native" token to function, protocols like Colored Coins and OpenAssets do not. I think these "native-token-less" protocols make a lot of sense and I can think of many use cases for representing various real-world assets as tradable tokens on the bitcoin blockchain (i.e. not speculative altcoins). Blockstream has also shown interest in the past in issuing assets on a sidechain via a different approach - but the main point is similar.
With regards to "piggybacking" on the bitcoin blockchain - I agree this was more of a concern before we had a functioning fee market. These days I don't think it's fair to say that these protocols are misusing resources. We are paying for their use just like anyone else.
I can't speak for others, but as far as Colu is concerned, I can tell you that these days we are very well aware of our responsibility towards the bitcoin network. We understand very well that bitcoin doesn't "owe" us anything - not its miners, not its users, and not its developers - and we're definitely not into blaming anyone for having goals that aren't matching our own. Our goal is to make it work, not to complain.
The reason we don't just "build our own network" is that we believe there's value in the network effects of bitcoin, and we think users of digital assets will benefit from them (as well as users of bitcoin, if these digital assets become popular). But we are committed to reduce the negative effect of our solutions on the network to a minimum, and we're paying for our usage fair-and-square.
We have recently showcased some of our work towards enabling Colored Coins support on LN - the goal here is to reduce our footprint on this shared resource. We are continuing to invest on that front, as well as other ideas. We're also in the midst of a process to become more "open", so the community will be hearing more on our efforts and roadmap soon.
But again, our business model is not dependent on any speculative token, so we're strictly focused on expanding the capabilities of the Bitcoin network on that front. There are no conflicting interests here as far as I can see. I think the same can be said about at least *some* of the other protocols in this space.
@_date: 2016-11-22 13:02:01
I can say from discussions with several players in the ecosystem, that there seems to be this interest to have internal transactions between users on a certain platform published on the blockchain.
I can't be specific about those, but there are some public examples: [In this document]( for example, Xapo CEO is talking about wanting to record 500,000 transactions a day on the blockchain, presumably internal bitcoin transactions between Xapo users.
We also know that BitFinex was/is trying to have seperate bitcoin addresses for each account on their platform, and settle transactions every once in the while on the blockchain, even though users don't hold the keys, presumably becuase this is somehow more transparent and easier to audit.
It's unclear to me why any platform would think this is a good solution, if the users aren't managing their own private keys. To me it sounds absurd. But many companies seem to believe that Bitcoin somehow "owes" them some capabilities, like making all of their internal transaction transparent, presumably to reduce trust in the platform, or to ease regulatory doubts. Personally I think that using "proof of reserve" solutions like Kraken's are much better as they don't bloat the blockchain and are essentially free. I don't know if companies like Xapo and BitFinex genuinely don't get this, or if they simply believe that this is truly what the bitcoin blockchain should become, but in any case I think this is what ViaBTC is referring to here, this belief of some companies that all of their internal TXs should be publicly available on the blockchain.
Maybe someone should tell them that if they just publish all of their transactions in a public Google Spreadsheet and sign the file with their PGP key, they will get the same result.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:21:51
This. It’s unfortunate that many other systems name their “block ordering providers” as “validators”, I think that goes a long way to confuse newcomers these days.
Another implicit assumption in OP’s question that I thought would worth addressing, is that if a miner is doing something verifiably “wrong”, we could punish them. But a miner could be anonymous, so it’s not clear that we could punish one and not the others - for whatever reason (like attempting a 51% attack)

I guess I'm not versed enough in how pruning works (and a little rusty with full node validation at large), but the idea of having a full node on a phone sounds intriguing.
What's the consensus library? Obviously loading the full blockchain data once is a no-go, but what if I trust a full node on my local network to get me bootstrapped with the up-to-date UTXOs, and keep maintaining things from there? Would that be feasible, using ~1-4GBs of storage?
@_date: 2015-07-13 06:07:14
Obviously, that's true. I'm considering a hybrid approach - use the trusted full node to initially get bootstrapped with the current state of the blockchain, then become a full node yourself (with a pruning enabled) getting and validating your blockchain data from that point on directly from the bitcoin network.

The process is intended to allow a (worthy) proposal to gain support from the community while it's being designed and developed. It makes sense that a proposal that would try to take shortcuts and not go through the process, would have problems gaining that support.

MOAR has no blocks, so there are no confirmations. We use **Emergent Block Rewards** so miners can emerge whatever reward they want, every 10 minutes, so changing the time doesn't make any real difference.
That being said, we agree that 10 minutes is archaic. However, after careful research we realized that 10-minute confirmations are **way** more confusing for regulators than Ethereum's 10-seconds confirmations, which is what they would expect, so we're going to stick with that.
@_date: 2017-04-04 08:02:04
Honestly, I think the reason for being "less open" in designing this proposal is clear, and I do wish people were more honest about their intentions.
We all know that some groups wish to change the process of getting changes into Bitcoin. This clearly influenced this proposal to a certain degree. Instead of beating around the bush, let's just accept this fact and move on. I don't think there's anything inherently "wrong" with that.
People are expected to do whatever they can to promote their interests, and if that includes letting the media know before the mailing list, then we can't (and shouldn't) stop them from doing that.
Let's discuss the proposal and not the politics. I'm too worried about the proposal itself to care about its packaging right now.
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:10:16
There's a reason why we have this concept of block maturity. You're not supposed to trust coins that were mined less than 101 blocks ago. So an LN user participating in a channel which is funded with immature coins, is taking a risk. If we think it's not that big of a deal, we could just change the parameter in Bitcoin Core, couldn't we?

I agree on all of your points, yet here we are talking about this proposal and not Johnson's.
People will use whatever works to get attention, and I'm not at all sure anything can be done about that. I think it makes sense that proposals that had undergone proper process will be of higher quality on average. Best way to show that is to discuss the problems in the proposal itself instead of its presentation.

I hope everyone involved will forgive me for being blunt, it's just that all of this beating around the bush is very difficult for me and I think it's unhealthy.
The way I see it, and obviously this is purely my personal point of view, Poon is taking VC money so he needs to show results quickly. He doesn't have ~100m$ in funding, so he doesn't have much time. The current deadlock just isn't an option.
While some people's (say, large hodlers) interests allow them to stay in this stalemate for many years, others will have to shake things up to survive. It's unfortunate but that's how it is

oh come on, who made you the *expert*
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:38:44
This isn’t about running a node, it’s about using it to validate incoming transactions. Are you doing that? Because if you don’t, your client might fool you to accept a 2xCoin transaction instead of a Bitcoin transaction.
Not your keys: not your Bitcoin.
Not your node: not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:20:46
They’re all claiming this attack is an “upgrade”, so they’re not exactly hiding. We will probably know, and we already know who signed the NY “agreement” (most pools did).
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:53:33
Yes I did mean that if you receive coins post-fork, your custodial wallet or SPV client might report those are real bitcoins while in fact they are 2xCoins. If there’s strong replay protection, the incoming transaction won’t be valid on the real bitcoin chain so you definitely didn’t receive Bitcoins.
If there’s no strong replay protection (looks like this is going to be the case), then maybe the 2xCoins transaction will be valid on the real Bitcoin chain and maybe not, and there’s no way for you to verify that without a full node in your control, running the Bitcoin consensus rules.
So it’s trivial to send you counterfeit coins and make you think they’re real, if you don’t run a full validating node of your own. This isn’t about unconfirmed transactions (don’t rely on them for any serious sum from an untrusted party anyway, even if you run your own full node). It’s also not about “right after the fork” - we can’t know when exactly miners will stop colluding on this attack - hours, days? Probably not weeks though. It’s an expensive attack...
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:49:30
This has nothing to do with node counts, and everything to do with each user protecting themselves.
Node count means absolutely nothing. But when you use your own node *to validate incoming transactions* (not just to “support the network” or “signal” like some people think they do), you are protecting yourself from the attack that 2x is trying to execute.
SPV clients are trivially attacked by colluding miners and can be fooled to accept counterfeit coins. This vulnerability has been known for years but people weren’t sure miners risk it. Now we know they might. To protect yourself, use your own fully validating node. You can remotely connect your SPV client to it btw!
Not your keys: not your Bitcoin.
Not your node: not Bitcoin.

So many people don’t seem to get this yet. I feel like most (somewhat informed) users still think this is about node counts.
I was really surprised with some of the comments in [this thread]( . Trying to think how I can communicate this more clearly before people learn the hard way...

Who said anything about evil?
I’m just asking a simple question. Maybe I’m a 2x supporter that want it to be known as the real Bitcoin Cash. Since Coinbase seems to be naming things based on  accumulated work, shouldn’t the real Bitcoin Cash be the altcoin with the most accumulated SHA256 work? Seems reasonable to me

Sorry I don’t get it. Why is it dependent on a large volume of on-chain transactions? Can’t you transfer some money to Xapo once a week/month and use it that way?

Here’s a cool trick:
You can keep using your ledger as usual, just set up a full node on your computer and have it ready. During/after the fork, when you intend to receive payments to your Ledger, add the receiving address to your full node as a “watch address” - no need to import any keys for that, nor would you have to resync.
If you see your bitcoins accepted on your full node, you know they’re real bitcoins!

That's not necessarily true. Even with no replay protection it's possible to split coins (and in fact, tools will be available to do that, and exchanges will probably do it for you). It's generally done by using coins mined post-fork in transactions. These coins are only valid on one side of the fork, and you can use them to split any older coins.
If you're an attacker trying to fool someone you're paying, you're definitely going to use coins that have been split that way.


It's not "no" verification. SPV clients verify that a transaction has been included in a block, in a chain with the most accumulated work. However, they can't verify that chain is *valid*, because they do not download the full blocks. Full nodes *do* check that the chain is valid, and ignore it if it isn't, until it find the *valid* chain with most accumulated work.
The security of SPV clients is dependent on miners not trying to collude to counterfeit coins - but in the case of 2xCoins, that's exactly what they're doing.


1. To be specific, if you want to use SPV clients as-is to receive funds, you'd have to wait until the real, non-2x Bitcoin chain gets considerably ahead with accumulated work. But this could take some time. Perhaps days? Can you hold off from using Bitcoin for so long?
2. "Using payment verification that works" means using a full node :) SPV clients can protect you from some fraud attempts, but can't protect you from miners trying to defraud you. Full nodes can.


And how would you know if you can trust that blockchain explorer? Blockchain.info for example, which is one of the most popular explorers out there, is a big supporter of 2xCoins. It's very likely they'll switch their explorer to the 2x chain. You might think "I'll ask around online if they use the true Bitcoin chain". But how would people online be sure? They'll be sure by running their own node and checking the results match! So the best way for you to be sure about your bitcoins is to just use your own node.
And if miners and companies like blockchain.info knew we were all running our own nodes, they wouldn't try to collude and do the fork in the first place, knowing there's no way it would succeed. That's the power of everyone running their own nodes!


When did you last try to do a fresh sync? This improves all the time, and with the latest 0.15 release we're usually talking few hours, not days. You should try it! In any case, yes there's some setup, but you only do it once. Getting a previously synced node back up to speed after some downtime is much quicker.

There’s no need to open any ports for this. You just need to locally add a new “watch address” to your node whenever you intend to receive funds using that address, and verify that the coins validate and show up.

Simple: go to your local Bitcoin ATM and buy $10 dollars worth.

Mine is shorter :)
It’s also true that if you send coins to a custodial wallet you might get them back one day. But yeah... I agree.
“Not your verifying node: not verifiably Bitcoin”?...
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:42:25
Other people call me a troll too :P
It’s because after 2x fails, some people (mostly those using SPV clients or custodial wallets) will be left holding a bag of 2xCoins they accepted after the fork, thinking they’re bitcoins.
Had they used their own full node to validate incoming transactions during/after the fork, this couldn’t have happened.

No, I’m not a 2x supporter :)
During the fork, some SPV clients can be trivially fooled to accept counterfeit coins. If you don’t validate incoming transactions with your own node, and after a short while 2x fails (as it probably will), you may be left holding a bag of counterfeit 2x coins.
Which is when you’ll learn to use your own node when validating an incoming transaction next time...

First of all, no, you’re not right. I’m a customer for a VERY long time, ever since I begged for a debit card during their beta testing.
As for the people agreeing with them, I honestly don’t know many and I’ve been looking. Many people support Bitcoin Cash, but this? It’s very rare.
But don’t take my subjective viewpoint at face value: the market has already shown that it doesn’t care for SegWit2x through futures trading.
And about them not harming anyone: when they’ll tell users that their altcoin is Bitcoin, they’ll hurt them. People who aren’t aware will lose money.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:44:07
True. I also meant SPV clients, which can’t do full validation and are trivially fooled by colluding miners.

The problem is that if I'm right (and the market currently says I am), Xapo users might lose funds. Miners might start with mining B2X for a few hours, causing Xapo to list it as "Bitcoin", and confusing those who aren't regulars on reddit/twitter/mailinlists/chatrooms etc. And there are *so many* who aren't.
By the time miners swing back to the original chain (and my bet is that it won't take long), some users may have already been defrauded by accepting "the wrong bitcoin" for example.
Remember many fraudsters look forward for moments of confusion like this, so that they can scam misinformed users. It's Xapo's job to protect them.

Don’t know what this has to do with complaining to bosses, but feel free to complain to my boss if I ever get one. Why not? You’re free to complain to whoever you want.
This isn’t about a business I don’t like. It’s about a business lying to their users and putting their funds at danger. This hurts the whole economy which is why I care - and why you should too.
I wouldn’t be posting reviews if Xapo wanted to support an altcoin and be clear about it. The problem is that they’re creating confusion.

This isn’t about supporting the network. In order to protect yourself from this attack, you can use a pruning node that rejects incoming connections.
You’re doing this for your own benefit and it’s well worth the cost of a few hours of setup+sync, and 5GB of space.

Technically there's a difference: to agree on who paid who, you need a ton of historical data. But if you can somehow reach consensus on just who own what *right now*, and you find a way to do that without requiring consensus on who paid who along the way, you can save *a ton* of space. MimbleWimble sort of does that...

Bitmain probably made more than one investment in Israeli companies in recent history.
However, many of us Israelis still hold the opinion that Bitmain picked a side, is sad, and doesn't further a solution!
