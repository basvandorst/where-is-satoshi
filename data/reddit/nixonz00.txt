thx for your response madsse, heres some info on me and the thesis:
About me:
Im 29 years old, study in Copenhagen at the IT-University and just started my master thesis. I started reading up on Bitcoin around 2012 and have been intrigued by the decentralized nature of network. I hold, use, but dont sell or do transfers in bitcoin, but I imagine that I will be soon though :)
About the report (I 'll try and keep it short):
I wish to write a report on the subject of Bitcoin from a consumer standpoint. The report aims to examine if there are any comparative advantages of Bitcoin utilization as opposed to traditional payment means.
I will conduct several open surveys in the report as a means of empirical data collection and convergence of the field of interest into a more tangible set of observations. These observations will be coupled with relevant theories and literature in order to give a palpable pattern of use cases, that I will conduct in the latter part of the report. Finally these use cases should give rise to theories that will be discussed in the final part of the report.

thx for your reply amgoingtohell :)
Sample technique is from posts or comments, within the last 35 days. My tolerance for the highest margin of error is 10%, which corrolates with a sample seize of 100, while doing a mixed binary and rating response.

Great he is offering a Bitcoin discount.. but wow.. even 100$ for that piece of crap is ridiculous..

Just to be clear, Bitcoin holds no intrinsic value and is therefore also fiat or am I missing something?
