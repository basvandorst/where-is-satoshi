I don't think you're a fool. The cost to make it is a very relevant part of its value. People paying 10x the cost of production are paying quite a high premium, considering the barrier to entry into production is very low, wouldn't you think?

Anybody who'd shorted that market would have made a killing.
@_date: 2011-07-11 18:53:04
Reddit is full of cynics, but yeah, that guy's a moron. Getting a site up would definitely be the easy part. Getting girls(&amp; managing them, as Jesse King mentioned), getting traffic, &amp; make the traffic convert money into BitCoins, &amp; then give the BitCoins to you, not so much.
@_date: 2011-06-28 02:51:09
Yeah, their market data page looks like it was put together by an idiot for a school assignment.
@_date: 2011-05-31 12:53:35
I think you over &amp; underestimate the banks. There's a quite real possibility they'll just want to profit off the speculation as it's pretty unlikely that BitCoin can completely break them.
While I'm sure there are a few bad apples among developers I kind of doubt that there's going to a lot of them among early adopters. That reasoning is hard to explain &amp; may be entirely bogus but my thoughts are that it takes too much time &amp; effort to get involved for someone who doesn't see the potential of BitCoin to spend.
I like where your head is at though. Keep thinking. I'm not fully cognizant of the details of how BitCoin works yet, so I can't really offer quality speculations on attacks. I think HighBeamHater has somewhat of a point about Blackhat hackers, but there's far more &amp; more reliable money to be made in BitCoins survival than its destruction.

I wonder if anyone is going to DoS the exchanges to flip people out more than they already are. If I were confident I wouldn't be caught I'd do it myself. It's already going to happen to some extent naturally.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:52:22
I consider that somewhat of a feature, but the price is way to high at this stage of adoption. You have a password that can easily be cracked on a currency system that is supposed to be anonymous? WTF?
@_date: 2011-06-13 00:28:26
The price is still way to high IMO. There's no way I can see that those buy orders on MTGox are enough available money &amp; interest to be propping up these exchange rates. Unless MTGox &amp; the other exchanges are sitting on a whole lot of cash that's waiting to buy when the price falls, but I doubt there's enough of that.
@_date: 2011-07-06 14:15:20

@_date: 2011-06-03 00:35:25
Why would anyone accept your currency though? The thing about BitCoins, that makes me think they'll work, is that there are several incentives to adopt them. Fuck man, one real good operation can eventually stabilize the currency. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 14:09:48
I nearly doubled my money already.
@_date: 2011-06-17 20:25:33
Not necessarily. You could all be making the same sort of mistakes. I'm not saying you are, but there's no reason to think it's mtGox's fault over yours until we know what is happening. Plenty of people still have money their.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:50:41
You're just not well informed. Two or three others had CSRFs found. Bitcoin7 is one of them.The guy with the awesome hair &amp; the guitar has a thread on BitCoin Forums &amp; it has been linked here.

His argument is basically that he had an agreement with mtgox to buy &amp; that mtgox had an agreed upon, authenticated, agreement to sell.
I'm less than happy about the rollback because I think that this situation could arise naturally &amp; this currency is a joke until it shows how it can deal with it.

A week or two. I thought there was going to be a major drop in price when mtgox opened up but instead the price was stable. That means that everyone else who's been waiting for that price drop is probably starting to think it's not going to happen too.

Your debit card isn't secure at all. Nobody has bothered to rob you, that's all. Damn near anytime you purchase anything in meatspace with it your debit card can be stolen. You also pay the price of central banking for having the central banks reimburse you.

@_date: 2011-06-21 02:17:24
I see the opposing view as well. I'm not being petty when I say that BitCoin is a joke until it's resilient against major players selling off, I mean it literally. It's also very bad policy to be rolling back all the trades. It should have never happened, but they fucked up, &amp; accounts were compromised, so the question of how to deal with it becomes complicated &amp; none of the options are good.
Until the price per trade is a reasonable, whatever that is, but analogue to the willingness of people to invest the price is pretty much meaningless, &amp; the usefulness as currency is minimal. Hopefully people will realize that after these problems. Well, actually hopefully they'll over compensate &amp; I'll be able to buy in at lower than what I think is a reasonable valuation, but you see what I mean.
@_date: 2011-05-17 21:24:55

This is kind of a good point actually. It's fairly trivial to deploy a social network(my host has six I can deploy with the press of a button, &amp; modifying the code wouldn't be that difficult, even for someone like me who is barely even a coder), so why counterculture types rely on these behemoths is kind of mind boggling.
@_date: 2011-06-20 13:16:20
I agree, must be gubment. There's no way a ridiculously over-valued crypto-currency would be an appealing target for hackers.
@_date: 2011-06-24 13:07:31
I don't understand what these people bitching about how they only gave one bit of information &amp; were rejected are thinking... how is mtgox supposed to know it's them? I have Dwolla, IP, &amp; proof that my email was associated with my account, but not in the leaked database. Since that's pretty near incontrevertible I left it at that, but if my email was in the leaked database I would have given more, even though my password is high in entropy.

Why would BitCoin be useful then? Purely for the fact that there is a set number of them &amp; so there is deflation? Why do you trust that the government would allow you to keep money in BitCoin further increasing the inflation other people were subject to &amp; why would a large corporation choose to pay in a deflationary currency?
I agree it's a good idea to keep it mostly above board, but actual government backing makes it worthless as would paypal. Part of the crash coincided with one of the developers stating their desire to cooperate with the government. Did you notice that?
EDIT: Clarified the bit about inflation.
@_date: 2011-08-19 14:09:51
You know what? Sure, why not. I'm a little surprised it hasn't gone up again already.
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:17:14
Hmm. I see your point about debit cards using two factor authentication, but from a thieves point of view I don't see how it matters since most debit cards work as credit cards. You make the sacrifice of a central bank &amp; in return they protect your money.

If there's a mass hoarder exodus it'll be at a much higher number I think.
@_date: 2011-06-13 16:08:53
I agree with one part of your statements &amp; I think it's critical, three years in we're already seeing centralizations of the BitCoin economy &amp; market players that collapse the value. Until &amp; unless the current between BitCoin &amp; other currencies grows strong enough that it requires panic on the part of a large portion of the BitCoin holders I'm afraid of using it. The value needs to collapse before I'll start to trust it.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:31:18
IMO MtGox is having its vulnerabilities tested hardcore atm, &amp; so when they're fixed it'll likely be a bit more secure. If you've been paying attention at least three exchanges had CSRF vulnerabilities found.

I'm honestly a bit surprised there has been so little of a move to implement lifespan betting so far. Hopefully you're correct &amp; it'll prove unnecessary. Were you on the mailing list where the idea was formed? I was incommunicado during that period, and I'm curious how much BitCoin overlaps.

@_date: 2011-06-12 20:42:28
Oh, I agree it's a neat idea. I even think the main exchanges should be fairly cooperative, but actively helping the government, or paypal, kills its utility IMO. I think passive cooperation is fine &amp; a legal exchange is a good idea, though.

I was accusing you of practicing nitwitery for calling someone a troll with little to no backing, but we all make mistakes, &amp; the fact that you're able to reevaluate is a good sign.

@_date: 2011-06-21 01:50:46

There are half a million reasons to do it. It's impossible to tell what the specific person doing it is trying to accomplish. My bet is on someone with a fair amount of money available who is attempting to increase market volatility.

@_date: 2011-06-13 00:44:59
Well, I'm not sure, but when when I hear that there are individuals with 100K BitCoins(not US dollars), &amp; that half of all BitCoins are controlled by the top 1000 people, &amp; I see like 100K worth of orders total, &amp; who knows how many of them which would disappear if the price suddenly started dropping it seems extremely far fetched to say $18 is a fair valuation.
EDIT: I guess I'd be trusting of a valuation that didn't make it easy for an individual or cabal to destroy the value.
@_date: 2011-08-09 03:41:16
It has some similarities to that, but most commodities do. Gold certainly does at these prices, as does silver. You appear to have mistaken me for someone who thinks BitCoin is going to work. I don't think so. I think it had a chance before the price shot up so far &amp; soured people on it, but now it's likely fucked.
@_date: 2011-07-08 00:26:32

I wouldn't be at all interested in BitCoin if it was backed by any of the things you mentioned, and I expect I'm not alone. You've described a worthless currency as far as I can tell if you combine BitCoins disadvantages with any of those things.
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:23:41
Are you seriously suggesting that you thought the price levels we've seen recently were indicative of anything but a bubble with the current level of BitCoin adoption?

@_date: 2011-06-03 15:35:33

@_date: 2011-06-11 14:51:43
I agree. I sold at $19 &amp; I'm not buying in again until it's down far enough that there is some chance of real adoption.
@_date: 2011-08-06 15:13:36
I agree. I'm not sure what benefit people think other people will see to buying in now.
@_date: 2011-06-12 19:35:49
I still don't see why you think there's an advantage to adopting BitCoin. I only think it's worthwhile for people if it's a gray market good. I don't think I need to explain why. You seem to think it has worth purely for what exactly?

I don't think the demand is increasing. I think a lot of people over invested themselves in BitCoin causing them to value it higher than someone outside of the BitCoin community would. In the future maybe demand will increase.

Gold is like BitCoins, except it's harder to get a fair price(the major problem), &amp; it isn't very portable. It doesn't have anything inherent about it to justify its price besides rarity.
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:36:36
This isn't completely accurate. It depends mostly on how the password is attacked &amp; the hash. If the technique you're using became popular you would have modified word combination attacks, which at their most retarded would have the number of words in a dictionary, say 10000-30000^(number of words in your phrase) as the number of attacks necessary. The other would have the number of acceptable characters, say 100^(number of characters).
Assuming 100 possible characters, a 10 character password, 10000 words, &amp; a five word passphrase the two are equal, without any sort of language optimization tricks. It's still a good technique though.
@_date: 2011-06-16 00:57:08
No it isn't. It's retardedly simple minded. That doesn't mean it isn't the right thing to do perhaps, but you ascribe the most banal motives &amp; a pathetic mind to someone who likely has neither.

If there isn't a market using BitCoins why would you want them? If nobody buys things with them the market will probably collapse because they will likely become worthless through lack of organic demand.

@_date: 2011-06-11 15:02:39
What? How? You can't get your money back easily, but that's social engineering fraud anyway, and that's possible with all currencies. Beyond that I'm only aware of technical fraud being possible if someone steals your wallet, or they control &gt;50% of the hashing power.
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:10:49
It's back out again.
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:47:48
That's certainly possible. The fact that it has become valuable while there are like 1000 people holding &gt;50% prior to widespread adoption is disturbing(none of them can cash out without moving the market a lot), but hopefully there will be some big crashes, the value will spread out, and then it will rise again stably.
@_date: 2011-07-08 00:21:40
Nitwit. Also, not the op.
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:07:12
Yes, that's my plan. I'm probably not going to buy until that happens though, because with too much of the market owned by a small group I think the market value is pretty much meaningless. I just don't know how I can trust a market where 10-20 people could utterly destroy it.
@_date: 2011-05-28 02:20:04
You're trying to sell to early adapters. The market is small &amp; most of them are probably very clever.

Skittish or out. There's going to be a bunch of investors rocking the market up &amp; down &amp; robbing everyone they can soon though. If they don't completely destroy it I'll buy in then.

Just because you've heard of LulzSec doesn't mean they're behind every attack. They're just loud, &amp; either funny or infuriating depending on your perspective.

It's both. Recognizing it for what it is requires foresight, and it requires good fortune to have been aware of it &amp; able to invest. I wish I'd heard about it earlier.

I think he outright made that up at what used to be a respectable institution.

You're assuming that the cracker was after BitCoins when attacking the financial auditor, in this scenario. I don't think that's a necessary assumption, &amp; if one assumes it isn't the case, &amp; the cracker doesn't know/care about BitCoins until he sees the large numbers, then MtGox's story is slightly more plausible.

I was considering a standing 1 cent order because I suspected something like this would happen.

What do you think I should do about it? I don't want to fuck anyone over, but if they're not crediting my account I feel like I need to make some noise.

You're not talking about betting the Senator dies at a ripe old age are you?

Are they really? From what I've heard carders have had card printers for some time now. The reason you can't buy bitcoins with a debit card is there's no guarantee the bank will actually pay, I thought.

The Dwolla transaction cleared on their website almost immediately.

How would you do that with Tor Browser? Unless you're just talking about catching the low hanging fruit who are logged into their actual facebook over Tor while selling drugs I don't understand.

I made about 20% on the bitcoin bubble because I liked BitCoins mission, and saw what was happening when it inflated. What exactly does litecoin really offer? Ok, so you offer a slightly faster blockchain creation, but it still doesn't compare to real money. Market cap is what? I'd honestly like to know because I'm just paying attention again recently because I think bitcoin will spike soon. The advantage to a centralized authority is that it can be quick, that'll make it so you can't compete I think, but if you can, explain, bitcoin only works by being De Facto, which it is now.
