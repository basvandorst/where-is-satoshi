uh... he's asking the bitcoin crowd if he should go somewhere else to invest his money.
Do you really need an explanation for this?

What does that even mean?
All but 2 comments are in support of bitcoin and/or trashing altcoin. Like I said: "You are asking the wrong crowd..."
There won't be much objectivity here. 
Top comment is an altcoin trashing article. Amazingly fanboi stuff. I'd give you a brief rundown of what's wrong with it, if I'd think you'd not reject it outright.
Listen: You, and most others here, are *emotionally* invested in bitcoin at this point. You are not capable of objective thought on the subject.

I think they should look at what fuels terrorism as opposed to what funds it. 
Seems to be a more fruitful path, imho.

Did it not come with a manual?
 
I can almost to a 99,9% degree say, from it's product sheet online, that you need the computer running for it to work.

You are asking the wrong crowd...
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:08:32


Also. Considering the fact that the bitcoin community here on reddit seems to be completely emotionally tied to the bitcoin at this point, and their arguments are turning more and more dogmatic as time goes along, I don't think asking any critical questions here will produce anything objective any more. 
sad really. The increasingly poor community might turn out to be the bitcoins downfall in the end.

Don't know why you are being downvoted.
As a developer myself, I've always wondered why the heck they never supply a suggested implementation for their protocols etc.
Well..It's not that relevant to bitcoin perhaps... :D

So..apparently buying shit ton of stuff in a market, destroys said market.
Yeh... I really want to try some of that stuff he smoked...seems out of this world. Or maybe I don't
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:23:46
amazing attitude. Great help you are!

I don't sse how a physical store would help this more than a well designed web-site, user friendly applications with a feeling of security.
again...who goes to the bank anymore?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:38:45
That's not what he said.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:34:24
sure... It might not be that much money for him though... But yeh. I agree
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:22:30
Assuming that everyone knows BTC-E is dodgy, is stupid imho.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:19:34
I don't see the upside. 
Most, if not all, of the early adopters are tech savvy. They have moved most of their activities into the virtual realm. Shopping, banking, entertainment etc.
Why would you want to go back to a physical store? Who uses physical banks today?
I don't know.

Pretty sure they are gone. 
You could report it to the police and hope they try to get a court order for the person sitting behind that IP adress. I doubt they will lift a finger, though.
It IS $10 000. So you might get lucky.

Thank you!
