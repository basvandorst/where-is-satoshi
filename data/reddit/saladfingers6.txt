The segwit update 2017 introduced a new adress format for Bitcoin. Legacy addresses starts with 1, segwit compatible addresses start with 3 and the new segwit addresses called bech32 starts with bc1. They make transactions smaller and cheaper fee. They have more benefits like better error correction and smaller QR codes.

It was all in the segwit update August 2017. Addresses starting with 3 look just like multi sig addresses so they are backwards compatible. Still many wallets and exchanges doesn't support the segwit address format making it cumbersome using a pure bech32 address wallet if you can't withdraw or deposit from it.

Something that the vast majority of the Bitcoin developers and thought leaders has agreed upon is the importance of Bitcoin node decentralisation. It must be possible for a "regular user/computer" to do an initial blockchain sync and verification and to be able to run a Bitcoin full node. Today the blockchain is 250gb and grows by \~100gb / year with full blocks since we increased the block size from 1 MB to 2 MB August 2017 with the Segwit upgrade.
Why is this necessary? Because if you can't run a node, you cannot verify the consensus rules (including inflation) and Bitcoin would be more centralised to data centers long term and become a more trust-based network. Bitcoin SPV wallets are un-able to verify if the miners just created new coins out of thin air. You always need to trace back all coins back the chain. Hopefully in the future all merchants and stores that accept Bitcoin / LN payments should run their own full node.
We need to scale smarter. For example before 2019 end we will get Schnorr signatures implemented resulting in a 20-30% increase in block capacity. Lightning Network is an important step for scaling and turning Bitcoin into an actual good payment network with instant confirmed almost zero fee micro-transactions. More research need to be made on how to optimize the blockchain storage. The newest addition to this research is MimbleWimble which \*may\* have a chance of becoming implemented in Bitcoin in the future which will vastly improve scaling without sacrificing disk space.
Bitcoin is a long game. We actually have the motivation to replace the central banks here. This isn't something we should be reckless about. Bitcoin isn't the new Paypal where onchain-transactions must be "super fast and cheap". It's much more than that. It's new sound money. It's a base layer for a new financial infrastructure where Lightning is the biggest trustless payment network application. All on-chains transactions needs to be logged on all thousands of nodes all around the world and stored forever, that isn't suitable your every day coffee payment. It might be so that the fees for a real Bitcoin-transaction are only viable for larger amounts in the future.

You don't need to be online 24/7. For example Eclair mobile wallet does a background process check on the chain every week or every two weeks to see that nobody posted an old state settling transaction. Because the channels you opens takes 2 weeks to force close and you have that time to check for wrong doings. Watch Towers is the solution to the always online security problem, you outsource that part. If you're running a LN-node being online all the time is the point so no issue there.

This is not an issue. Almost all lightning nodes accept a new incoming channel to them.. Some have minimum value requirement at at least 300k or 500k satoshis. The bigger issue is how to find someone that want open channels to YOU so that you can get inbound liquidity.

There is no silver bullet to let everyone in the world do cheap transactions at scale and keep decentralisation. There are only tradeoffs. What we have right now may last us some time and in the mean time we're building new infrastructure to handle this new sound monetary system while using the block space as effective as possible.
If we would have full 2 MB blocks for the next 10 years, the blockchain would have grown 1 TB. Bitcoin Cash (BAB) has 32 MB blocks today, with full blocks the chain would grow another 16.8 TB in 10 years. And for that you only went from 14 tx/second to 224 tx/s. So that is a very stupid, short sighted and inefficient scaling solution. Do keep in mind that every new Bitcoin Node user will have to download and verify all that data from scratch. Bitcoin + LN today can scale vastly better than 32 MB blocks.

People create "channels" between each other by each depositing Bitcoin into a multisig smart contract on the Bitcoin Blockchain that locks up funds in the Lightning Network. Bitcoin payments can now be sent with instant confirmation to almost zero fees within the Lightning network making Bitcoin the best method for payments ever.
People opening these payment-channels between each other create the Lightning network, because payments can be routed through other users to reach your destination.
The network is still in beta, has some liquidity and routing limitations compared to on-chain Bitcoin. Lightning is completely off-chain and P2P. At any time you can close your channel and settle your Bitcoin balance back to the blockchain and your funds are unlocked again. 
In a couple of years Lightning wallets is the only  thing that makes sense having in a phone or similar for every day payments since it scales so well.

If someone controls 51% of mining they can mine blocks and not include transactions or only include their own transactions. What makes Bitcoin censorship resistant is that even if 49% of the miners chose to block your transactions, there will be a miner that will include it eventually.

Are you aware of that a 51% attack still needs to create blocks that follow the consensus rules. They can't do anything harmful to Bitcoin. They would be able to mine empty blocks and thus censor transactions. They could also deposit money to an exchange, reorg the chain and steal from the exchange (double spend).

What? If an attacker has 51% they can continously mine and control the longest chain. Any new block from the 49% crowd will eventually be orphaned.

Let's say you have 10 Bitcoin but wants to send 1 to somebody. In this case you spend all of the 10 Bitcoin in one transaction but it will be split up, 1 to your friend and 9 to a new adress that is also yours, a "change" address.
So when an amount this large is moved along with a 0.1 btc output it is usually that amount that actually was sent.
Some wallets have the feature of creating even more output actresses which also belongs to you. This is to increase anonymity as its hard to tell which coins were actually sent away or just sent back as change.

The "China controlling" statement is false though. What controls Bitcoin is the vast network of nodes that reject invalid blocks. Even if China stole all miners they couldn't control Bitcoin. They could only censor transactions and maybe double spend their own money as long as they keep up with the attack which is extremely expensive.

1800 BTC currently gets mined every day. At current price that is $14M that needs to be swallowed up by the market each day just to keep current price. Now imagine it's suddenly changed to just $7M being dumped every day.. If the demand to buy BTC stay the same as today, the price must go up after halvening. An interesting point is that it's not possible to really price in the halvening before it occurs. Because if price go to $16k now, we suddenly have $28M being dumped daily lowering back the price.
@_date: 2019-02-06 12:44:57
Not for some time at least. Much has happened since then. Remember it was a crazy hype where everyone wanted to get in. FOMO. A large amount of onchain Bitcoin TXs came from Bitconnect and shortly after that pyramid scheme collapsed the transaction fees dropped dramatically. Today with 50% segwit adoption fees are even lower than early 2017. Many exchanges have implemented segwit but most importantly, batching of transactions which reduces onchain load. The Schnorr upgrade to Bitcoin will result in a \~30% increase in transaction space. Lightning Network already becoming popular and THE way of making smaller payments using Bitcoin. So no $1 coffee bloat on-chain.

There are still many ways of optimising the block space. Segwit only has \~50% adoption. Not all exchanges do batching. Exchanges and sending Bitcoin between exchanges actually make up for the vast majority of all transactions today still and all that can be optimised away to second layer like Liquid or Lightning for instant settlement between exchanges. BitPay the largest online Bitcoin payment processor doesn't use Segwit (and still market Bitcoin as high fee and Bitcoin Cash as low fee). Binance doesn't use Segwit nor does [blockchain.info]( the biggest web wallet. BitMex doesn't batch. With Schnorr signatures we get a whopping 30% reduction of total transaction size if inputs signatures are joined into one. There are tons of way still other than simply increasing the block size limit which would only discourage actual smart optimisations. I mean why would exchanges spend time to implement batching if the blockchain promised 1 cent fees forever and if fees goes up the block size limit is simply increased?

3.5 years in, they still don't support Segwit-addresses that would cut transaction fees by -50% for users. Also they show no interest in supporting Lightning which is a natural step for payments over Bitcoin. Instead they are pushing Bitcoin Cash to its users.

I don't know about Finland. But in Sweden (where I am from) people are literally dying waiting for treatments (we even send people over to Finland), that is the best one of the worlds richest country could do with government planned health care. I don't know if Finland has reached some utopian model that works, but there is no denying of economic facts. Central planning of the economy with tax money can never be efficient and work in the long run. There can be no correct use of resources when there is no prices (the socialist calculation problem). There are tons of material that explains this. We live in a scarce world and the market with prices is the best way to use the resources efficiently. Sweden and Finland both live on old merits,, we didn't get rich because of high taxation,, we got rich first,, then we raised taxes and imposed a welfare state... Stagnation and decline in living standard for all is whats to expect. But it sometimes can be hard to see the "unseen and the unrealized". We don't see the prosperity and well being that would be hear without the welfare state and taxation. We can look at countries like Switzerland which show four twice as high living standard compared to Sweden even though we were very similar at one point (before the swedish welfare state) ...

You remove all 3rd party trust which is the core idea of Bitcoin, hence the statement "don't trust - verify". Your own full node will download and verify the block chain and use Proof of Work to determine the longest chain. PoW and the consensus rules replacing trust. In case of a fork or split attack you can ultimately trust your own node to be on the correct network.
If you're using Electrum or any other wallet you are not only trusting some 3rd party full node on a server some where to give you correct information about the blockchain, you will also expose your addresses, your balance and how you use your bitcoins.
The worst thing is to put your bitcoins in some custodial exchange of course. Using Electrum+Hardware wallet is a very good choice, BUT running a full node together with your hardware wallet really make you a first class bitcoin citizen.

In the short term yes. But long term Lightning is a direct competitor to Liquid and it allow for instant transfer between exchanges so it should be the default inter-exchange settlement network.

Gold is much more easy to confiscate. It's also very expensive to transfer gold between countries while it's super cheap to final clear cross border Bitcoin transactions. In about 6 years the inflation of Bitcoin will be lower than gold, and therefore a better store of value than gold.

The interesting part is, how does the network prevent you from publishing an old transaction balance sheet to the blockchain which is more beneficial to you? Well. If you do, your counterpart can publish another counter-transaction that steals all your money. This is because when the balance sheet is updated with a new balance, secret keys to the older balance sheet is revealed. There is smart contract code in the multisig wallet on the blockchain that allow any of you to settle the balance sheet but you also have to wait 1000 blocks, this gives time for the other party to publish a transaction that gives him all the money, but only if he has the secret key, which he only has if it's an old transaction state. This is why we need watch towers for people running a mobile wallet that isn't constantly online watching the blockchain, because if someone publish an old state to steal your money, you need to be reactive and prevent it.

This is not true. You need housing, you need to eat, you need to pay for a lot of stuff. You might NEED a car, NEED a bigger house for your family. Of course you will in the future end up spending your money even though it is deflationary. If you're not spending them,, your kids will. They money WILL be spent, even though it may be in the future which is only good, because the value should increase.
Why do people buy TVs and smartphones at all when the next years model is so much better every year? Because of time preference. Humans still mostly prefer stuff in the present. If they defer their spending it only signals that they are totally pleased for the current moment, and capitalists need to focus on improvements and new products and services that you actually need/want. That is what drives society forward. If everyone just spend everything we will be stuck. The fact that people are saving is signalling that they will buy stuff in the future, which lead to a lot of capital investments to create the products and services that you will buy in the future = jobs are created.

Thiers' Law, my friend... When merchants don't want anything else than Bitcoin you are forced to spend them. It happens right after hyperbitcoinization. Reduced spending is NOT a counterargument against deflationary currency. You should hold and spend the best money (Greshams law) until you run out of bad money (fiat), but as long as you get income in fiat you better just buy more and hodl btc and spend fiat.

You don't have to call everything shicoin. It's enough saying we accept bitcoin because it's the most sellable and has the best chance of becoming sound money global currency. I've seen the statistics, 90% pay with bitcoin despite the occasional high fees because it's the coin most people hold.
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:36:11
Bitcoin will probably go to &gt;$100 000 within the next 5 years... Why wouldn't it? What is the alternative? That ut was all a bubble that popped at $20k and now we are going down and die along with all other altcoins? (There are no legit competitor to Bitcoin that scales better with the same amount of security, decentralisation and trust minimization).
Bitcoin is a fantastic savings device, the best the world has ever seen, and people are buying bitcoin monthly all around the globe, as long as that is taking place, the price will only continue to go up as the inflation goes down and weak hands that don't HODL sold. In the end there will be only people that never sell below $100K left.
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:50:09
So you're actually asking if Bitcoin ever again will rise back above 10k? The bitcoin network is growing, the usage is growing, the need for Bitcoin is growing as the old financial system is is losing trust among the people. Bitcoin has multiple halvenings to go and historically we have only increased in price the first 10 years of existence. Now ask yourself once again... Will Bitcoin ever rise to 10k again?
@_date: 2018-07-09 03:59:10
Not as long as crypto ATMs have ~10% in fees. 
@_date: 2019-09-28 10:13:54
Technically Lightning is almost just like a separate coin. Lightning is a separate network of nodes. In the future though I hope we could merge the Bitcoin and Lightning payment into the same QR-code so your wallet automatically chose what it supports.
@_date: 2019-09-22 09:34:59
The "clear instantly" thing with litecoin is mostly a marketing scam from their side.. A bitcoin transaction is cleared after 1 confirmation usually, even BitMEX accept deposit after 1 confirmation. Litecoin on the other hand require 16 confirmations or something like that to be "cleared", so it's in fact slower. Cleared = protected by hashing power from being double spent.
But I get what you mean ;) Litecoin could probably feel faster and be cheaper to use if Bitcoin currently suffers from high fees before Lightning has bigger adoption and by then Litecoin will be irrelevant just like any other crypto currency focusing on cheap/fast payments.
@_date: 2019-09-28 11:04:51
They accept 0-conf for Bitcoin and Litecoin. Not secure but people physically visiting a store paying for a $2 coffe will probably not double-spend attack.
@_date: 2019-09-22 09:43:49
I do. It was sold as scalable but they recently admitted they knew it wasn't which is the definition of a scam: [
Also 70% of the current coins in circulation is from their ICO pre-mine making it very unfair for new users and miners. Constantly talking about moving to Proof of stake which is another scam that only enrich the big holders and has been proven to only work in a centralised way.
Javascript-like turing complete code right on-chain is an extremely dumb design decision making it not only unscalable but also makes it impossible to do what Ethereum is should do: writing secure and scalable smart contracts. There are constant hacks and money stolen due to this fact. Bitcoin already has Script and possible Simplicity in the future that let you do provable bug free contracts.
Ethereum is a shitcoin. It's made only for marketing and it's perfectly for scamming, but sucks when it comes to actually run smart contracts.

@_date: 2019-09-22 03:19:59
How can Litecoin have "potential" when it's only a direct clone of the bitcoin source code?
And ETH cannot be sound money because firstly it doesn't scale and secondly it has a unpredictable future token supply and inflation. 70% of supply is pre mine.

"Any alt-coin that forks off Bitcoin begins by taking away the predictability of the money supply because, Look, we are a bunch of people that can change the code of Bitcoin.

There is no chance that they will compete with the original implementation of Bitcoin - the one whose the money supply doesn't change." - Saifedean Ammous

This would only be possible if Bitcoin was some centralized software that hard forked and have its fundamental rules changed dynamically.
It took forever just to make segwit with a 2x block increase possible, to reach developer consensus, to get the network on board.
A block size increase has been tried but been shot down by the developer community rather quickly. It's currently very unlikely to happen.

Encouraging spending is economic lunacy. People will spend anyway because they need somewhere to live, eat food to survive, leisure like travel, movies. A deflationary currency is what will cause economic growth and prosperity because people don't overspend. They save and invest in new companies that produces new awesome products and services that people actually want. If you are not spending, it means you are pleased for the moment. No need to force people to go out and spend in that case. The world flourished on the gold standard and will do so even more on the Bitcoin standard. Just look at what state we are in today in modern society where spending and borrowing is encouraged. It's a mess. Everyone is indebted, no savings = economic stagnation.

C64 computers or Zunes aren't liquid assets. They are not easily divisible. They are also easily to replicate. Not easy to store and transact with. Not fungible. Not global. So very bad as money compared to something like gold or Bitcoin that tick all those boxes making them superior as money.

If Lightning takes off people will need to start openening and closing a bunch of channels each requiring an onchain transaction. Majority of TXs will probably occur on LN in the future, but this would put a big constraint on the blockchain and fees will most likely go up a lot again.

Lightning Network is a p2p payment network which is backed by real Bitcoin. First you send some of your bitcoin to the Lightning network which requires a regular transaction. Now you can send and receive Bitcoin instantly and almost at zero fees within the Lightning network.

Initial blockchain download and verification will be. You wouldn't launch a node that takes 1+ week to download.
There are so many more optimizations that can be done other than just simply increasing the block size. We currently have more transactions per day than late 2017 with not at close the high fees because of segwit and bathing and other. Side chain inter exchange settling will do a lot.

Exactly. It's a keynesian fallacy that spending drives demand. It has been debunked so many times for so many years. Today with internet and Youtube people online shouldn't buy in to that crap.
Of course all money will be spent by someone. If it's not you, you will give it to your kids who will spend them and so on. We save to spend in the future. It's up to entrepreneurs to find out what we possible might want in the future with our savings.
If everyone just consumes what they got every month we get stagnation. We just keep buying the same stuff. But when people stop overspend, it sends the signal to the market that the people are pleased for the moment but will spend in the future. And in the future people will line up to purchase the next iPhone or flying Tesla.
