Who does that -- bad business? Holds back ones own money at the moment they say so? Lesson learned.  I am trying to transfer less than an 8th and am also held back. Did it about 5 hours ago.

Using changetip seems to be the most dependable solution Dave. With change tip you can accept bitcoin and dollar donations through many other platforms like reddit.
have 0.03 on me, davegri! coinbase.com is also a good place to secure your wallet as NginUS suggested. I hope this helps.

I don't see why a down vote is even needed here? I am doing this for people, not for me; i am not gaining a thing out of this, but maybe a little reputation on reddit. I took an hour or so to send the email &amp; create this page on reddit. If this helps the people and also helps bitcoin thrive I will personally be striving to keep this up for other companies out there who still haven't caught on. We the people can change the world, but the people have to work together to do it. I did this out of the kindness of my heart &amp; would appreciate it if others who are bitcoin enthusiast would help by connecting us using the World Wide Web, more specifically, Reddit =)
This is definitely not spam and to prove that I will send you pictures of the email &amp; keep everyone updated through reddit. Still waiting on a reply to see their thoughts on the subject though.
