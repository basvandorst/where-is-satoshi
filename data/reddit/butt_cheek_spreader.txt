You're keeping your coins in cold storage and who do you think is giving value to your cold storage coins? magic fucking fairies buying and selling on exchanges?

Because we went from nothing to $600 in 5 years doesn't mean bitcoin has now become a buy now and get a free ride to the top. This is still an experiment and many will still lose most if not all of their stash to psychological pressure in-between the bubbles, failed exchanges, regulation, fud, hackers, shitty trading skills and most important - lack of patience.
@_date: 2014-08-12 22:52:55
Looks like someone is getting desperate for the price to increase.

Don't know why you stress yourself, from his comment, he is clearly capable of grasping complex ideas. If he refuses to acknowledge bitcoin even with all the information freely available to him, that is his problem. 
While adaptation is taking place, there will always be those left behind because of stubbornness, ignorance or inaction, etc. Such is life.

Why? if you live in Nigeria for example and have internet access, you cannot use PayPal because it's blocked and sending wire transfers takes long and is expensive (you also need to be banked) but with bitcoin you can send to anyone on the planet, anytime, no restrictions, no fee, all you need is internet access... this is an untapped market, why compare it to other online payments?
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:18:18
This is non-trader talk, as a non trader why would you look at the price everyday anyway?
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:53:38
Well, if you put it like that then "wealthy investors" invest into MLM with every investment they make and should have no problem investing into bitcoin.. Forex, the whole damn stock exchange is MLM according to the way you describe it.

Why are you saying bitcoin is anti-fragile? we're testing that right now but you seem to have made up your mind already, good luck.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:36:42
Apparently some people don't understand sarcasm.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:24:04
Technically, there will be nothing standing in the way of core adopting segwit so the answer to your question is likely - yes.
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:58:33
Okay, you need to stop with the MACD bullcrap.. Look, stop trading, don't do anything, don't even watch the price because what you're doing is called gambling. Wait one or two years for the price to recover, it probably might even be a few months... who knows.. as long as you don't sell out into a huge loss, you're good.
In the mean time, grab a book called "Antifragile" It will help you a lot, I promise. Take my advice or don't but I've been down this path before so I understand how you feel.
Take care.

I'm hoping we'll see some pump by april but right now I feel it's going to be mostly sideways and dumps in between.

Funny thing about this announcement is that they accuse okcoin of providing margin which caused abnormal fluctuations in the market but we had way more and bigger fluctuations before any exchange ever provided margin.
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:22:37
They stopped on okcoin.cn and other chinese exchanges, okcoin.com is international and based in hong kong - that's why it still has x20.
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:19:01
I reckon it will be legal but your bank might see you as some kind of risk for moving so much money around and they have the right to close your bank account. Either go and talk to a manager at your bank and try to explain this or go and ask one of the guys on local bitcoins how they do it.
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:34:14
If BTCC's assets get frozen, the crash will be worse than bitfinex hack, strap on your sitbelts and get your money out of chinese exchanges my fellow hodlers!

Totally pulled it out of my juicy buttcoin but I don't see why it can't happen.
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:04:38
speaking from experience? I've seen the same guys doing this on local-bitcoin for the past 4 years, god knows how they do it.
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:45:51
Yep, I'm also waiting for pboc so start messing with okcoin, limited margin trading will be good.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:36:41
Yep, this is one of the most plausible things I've read on this sub.

Actually, the black market price of USD in Nigeria (which is basically the official rate because at the moment it's the only way to convert Naira to USD) pretty much normalizes this price. 
Getting your money out of Nigeria is almost impossible, you have to convert to USD at the black market price then you can take it out of the country in small batches in your luggage... Oh, and you can't use your bank card abroad... All this nonsense because the government is "fighting corruption".

They can be mined, yes. However, the asicboost exploit will no longer work.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:54:56
So basically, Gregory Maxwell reverse engineered a Bitmain ASIC chip and proved that there is an asicboost exploit implemented that makes them more efficient than other asics. 
Bitmain is possibly breaking patent law on asicboost.
Segwit is not compatible with with this boost so Bitmain/Jihan and his customers (Chinese miners) will lose out      economically if we get segwit.
Essentially this whole BU thing or Block size debate looks like a cloak and dagger move to keep bitmain ahead of their competitors and make them and their customers rich including Roger Ver who famously told us everything on MTGOX was fine a short time before the whole exchange shut down and took every ones money.

I'll be honest, both subreddits are completely delusional, can't wait for the mid/long term bear market so that everyone finally sits down to think and analyse instead of spewing delusional shit all over the place.

Btce has very low liquidity, If you want to trade with high leverage and good liquidity, try OKcoin. 
They have futures and also normal unleveraged trading, good luck!

Holy shit, I tried to get an account with them but they sent my bank card to the wrong address two times, then asked me to proof my identity is linked to my address so I just proceeded to fuck them off. Thank god for their incompetance, would have had my money stolen too.

Haha, that would be awesome! They say teaching is the best way to learn afterall.
@_date: 2016-07-24 09:44:51
Well, there are three theories.
1 - MTGOX had a bot nicknamed willybot that was literally carrying the price up, this is still not fact but you can find some pretty detailed information on it if you do your research.
2 - China entering the bitcoin market in a big way, mostly through OKcoin skyrocketed the price for about 3 months straight before the MTGOX fiasco.
3 - My all time favourite and probably the real reason, Silk road was shut down by the fbi, removing the Underground reputation bitcoin had and bringing in all sort of investors, bull speculation and hope, because asking someone if they know what bitcoin is would not have to get you some drug or underground related answer anymore. The price increase when SR was shutdown was instantaneous.
