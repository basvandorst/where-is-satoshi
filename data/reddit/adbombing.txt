How about I PM you a screenshot of some of an email exchange today with a local billboard vendor?

This would be great just to have a crowdfunding site that has bitcoin integrated. While we accept bitcoin on our site, it's been a bit frustrating that the usual suspects (kickstarter, indiegogo, etc) do not have bitcoin payments integrated. The thought was we would put an address in the description and then any btc donations would be shifted to $ and then redonated back on the 3rd party site to help us meet our goals, but it would be so much better if we could just have bitoin as a donation option with whatever site we launch the project on.

Right now we're prepping the launch of the official project to put up (most likely) on indiegogo. Should launch in about a month. We're going for 3 billboards for 3 artists for a 2 month period which includes Art Basel, the largest art festival in the US so we're hoping it will help provide some exposure for the artists. We're updating Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook regularly if you'd like to keep up with the latest.
Most importantly, thanks!

Combination of factors really, main points being:
Some really bright people investing real money in to building an infrastructure. When the guy that invented the web browser gets behind a new technology in a big way, people should be paying attention.
Being so early in the adoption cycle and seeing how the community does what it can to spread the message, we thought it would be a good PR move.
Most important factor was a simple financial decision. The difference in processing fees means we can put a larger % of people's donations to work for the cause, and bitcoin makes it real easy for people outside of the US or that don't have credit cards to contribute. A $5 donation nets us $4.55, $5 worth of bitcoin nets us $5. That makes a big difference when you're relying on mostly small donors.
Cool new tech for the sake of cool new tech.

Actually just tweeted that out :)
Coinbase gives you the first $1M in conversion fee free on merchant accounts, and even if we pay the standard 1% it still nets $4.95 v $4.55. Outgoing fees aren't really part of the equation because there may be outgoing fees for $$$ depending on how they are being spent. Regardless, it was just to demonstrate the difference in how much actually winds up in our account vs the processor's.
I'm not up on the tax write-off aspect but can't you send from a wallet/service that doesn't have a fee?

I'll take a few minutes and set up a wallet at your place of choosing if we're talking about a real donation

You could [donate to our billboard crowdfunding efforts]( if you'd rather see some art in the sky instead of another advertisement. Can't promise bitcorn snark, but can promise some sweet street art in the sky.
