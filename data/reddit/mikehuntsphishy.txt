I'm saying he is a water carrier for the people with money that you'll never know. If you think said people are above a frame you're naive. Silk road could be viewed as a dent in the profits of a 3 letter agency..the same 3 letter agency that would be easily capable of faking such messaging.

We do know that he was of a very libertarian mindset which majorly tends to be you know, live and let live. You may proceed with loltinfoilhatmuhconspiruchy something or the other now.
