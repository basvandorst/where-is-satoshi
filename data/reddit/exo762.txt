This report is so FUN that I've gone in full circlejerk mode.
[Direct link to the report](
"Problems that will hamper adoption":
1) *transaction confirmation is slow* **LN fixes this problem for PoS**  
2) *costs are hidden, not removed* aka block reward will get low **this network has all the chances of growing**  
3) *failure points remain* aka bad wallets and bad exchanges fail **yep, that's a problem of Bitcoin /s**  
4) *legal problems* aka it's hard to do KYC and AML on it **why would anyone need that broken shit?**  
5) *volatility* **don't put your all eggs in one basket**  
6) *adoption* **HOLY SHIT, this report has just gone recursive!!!**  
7) *scalability* **once again, solution is in progress**  
8) *internal conflict and inertia* **bitcoin moves forward 1000% faster than banks**  
9) *reduced decentralization* **yep, real problem here; there are some theoretical solutions though**  
10) *regulation* **nope, this is a problem of banks, not Bitcoin**  
11) *irrecoverability* **not all eggs in one basket**  
12) *irreversability* **what are arbiters for?**  
12) *unguaranteed security* i.e. bitcoin will march on even if hash rate will drop to 10Hps **WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK**  
You can see tears, blood, and sweat of poor corporats who were forced to create this PR piece while secretly HODLing BTC.

Mike's arguments about system behavior under stress are perfectly reasonable. I have my share of experience with systems for extreme load. Believe me, unless specific measures were taken and some extra work was done, systems don't degrade service quality gracefully if load goes over the capacity of service. They don't start behaving badly for percentage of users, they start behaving unpredictably and usually they just crash.
Bitcoin as a system does not have mechanisms for dealing with extra load. There is no [HTTP code 503]( built into Bitcoin. Nor any other similar system. So instead of seeing a graceful "try again later" user will see unpredictable transaction delivery time OR lose control over his money for 2 weeks. Visa and MasterCard don't behave this way. Computers generally don't behave this way. This will surprise and piss off user and as such, this is unacceptable behavior and such scenario should be avoided at all costs. For Satoshi and Gavin, two previous leaders of the project, such situation was not even an option. But today Bitcoin core is maintained by Vladimir, who IMHO does not provide any leadership whatsoever.
And please don't count on "hmm, system seems to be overloaded, I better raise fee" behavior. You will see instead "Ohh, I will just pay with cash and dump all this BTC on exchange. It was a mistake buying it in the first place!".
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:44:05
Why are you here? What brought you here from @_date: 2015-06-09 08:39:57
There is no proof that "some of core devs are against block size change because of blockstream". But there is a obvious conflict of interest here.
And worst thing - those guys:
1) don't have experience running huge services (fee market? more like price diving into $20-$50 range because of panic and lost of trust)
2) don't really offer any solutions. Peter Todd gives a great example of "leadership" by summoning huge amount of "what ifs" (e.g. "if govs all around the world will crack down on Bitcoin, we will not be able to run nodes behind TOR" nonsense).
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:20:22


This is how you sound. Calm down a little.
And news for you. Computers have to adhere to protocol to communicate. You, yourself, can do whatever you want. So why not go and create a system that will allow for all that awesome human consensus while still doing some useful work?
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:38:31
So it is an argument against increase of limit to 20mb as opposed to increase to say 4mb. I like that we both agree on increase and on method of increase.
Why such game theoretic possibility is irrelevant even if it exists: right now there are other known possibilities to stray away from good behavior and make marginally bigger money and miners don't use them. Why? 
Because people are not mindless game theoretic machines (at least while rewards are small).

It may or may not happen (the buy in by large players). Why do you even care? Bitcoin is useful today and will be even more useful tomorrow.
Chances that Satoshi has control over those keys are miniscule. Man that smart would have destroyed them long ago. Why? Because everyone knows what happens to people who win on lottery. In case of Satoshi - his life (the one which he lives and loves) would have ended the moment he would show the world that those private keys are not lost.

This kills Bitcoin.
And please don't tell me that "freedom", "banks", "settlement in 90 days", etc. As a user, I care about payments very little. Payments should work, period.

This will lead to crash, because fee market will not happen. Think "transaction without fee" problem but on massive scale. Every time you send money there is a chance that they will hang in limbo for 2 weeks. Market is possible if there is a meaningful feedback loop or at least some way of checking the prices. Money being blocked in case of fee too low is not feedback, it's a kick in the nuts. Even if we will assume that fee market is possible, it is not realistic right now because of lack of software supporting it.
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:33:10
All "large players" diversify their capitals. They will not dump all their money into Bitcoin overnight, this will not happen. But they are already investing in Bitcoin businesses and this is smart investing.
And if you are speaking about possibility of Citibank moving to BTC - this will not happen. Why? Incompatibility. They might start providing some services related to BTC. They might invest some cash in startups. Again - diversifying.

They still would have to accept blocks coming from outside. And if limit is set to 20MB, they would sometimes get blocks as large as 20MB and they would be obliged to accept those blocks or risk mining on orphan branch.

I'm probably feeding a troll, but fuck it. In no particular order:

* prediction markets (see augur project)

* micro-transactions
* smart property
* SAFE p2p payments (CCs and banks are not safe, forget it)
* fast, cheap and safe international payments
* cheap joint custody over money, no lawyers needed (multisignature/treshold wallets) 
* TRUSTLESS money
* no censorship
* Internet of Things

Great article!
I'm strongly on 20mb side, because there is no way fee market can materialize this fast. Wallets have no fee estimation mechanisms; delayed/failed transactions are real problem right now since user can't do anything about blocked money; 1MB is too small no matter if fee market is possible or not. And finally, crash landing is a real possibility.

members have been repeating words decentralized and consensus which both mean very specific things in so many contexts that they pretty much lost their meaning.
Consensus is achieved while solving Byzantine generals problem by miners. It's a consensus between machines and it's about transactions. It's not a consensus between people or between developers.
Decentralization. Same thing - no way to censor or block transactions, to limit one's access to network, to shutdown whole thing by attacking single point of failure. It's not decentralization of development process or decision making process.

I'm running full node on VPS. People are running lite nodes because blockchain is huge. Do you have any numbers on how much of that is "spammers" contribution? 
You are using blacklist to solve a problem which has nothing to do with few bad actors. This is a problem of Bitcoin as a network - blockchain exists in multiple copies and grows ad infinitum. We need two improvements: 
* blockchain compression (yeah, I know how it's looking right now. Rocket science is a child's play next to this one)
* O(1) block propagation times (Gavin's reverse bloom filters patch)
The patch you've authored does not solve any real problems, it is misguided (because it introduces censorship in a top-down way as opposed to "my node, my rules") and in bad taste (conflict of interest, enabled by default). It would probably be fine if it was not added by you in the distro and if it was not enabled by default. I think though that it's impact is very limited and it is not worth the storm it's causing on @_date: 2014-11-11 15:39:18

Or as a browser extension (bookkeeping only ofc). But note that this solution means as many fees as donations, where in case of Flattr you have one fee per month for donator and one for benefactor. Very effective.
Isn't it a perfect use case for sidechain? Those donations are by definition very small ("cheap as click") and not very suitable for storing in blockchain.

Oleg, you are greatly overestimating that spiral. At least here in Poland state needs to spend only 1 PLN to earn from taxation 9 PLN. Economically for state this process is very efficient.

This is not an audit. It's a joke. With that level of sophistication I myself would pass with flying colors such audit, and I'm not an exchange. 
1) Where is the confirmation that exchange actually controls those addresses in blockchain?
2) How do I know that my account is on the list that was provided to the auditor?
What's with whole tech cool words used in article? I get that journalists are incompetent, but Caleb Chen got all those "technobabble" from someone, and that someone demonstrated level of chutzpah that is over 9000.
Some analysis.
They used JSON. That would be amazing, if wikipedia didn't had definition of JSON. Why this information was included into article?
They had "tools" on the level of bash oneliners. One basically does SUM(A1::A100)/SUM(B1::B100). Other did some amazing thing called "such address exists and it has that amount of coins on it". I can do such "calculations" using browser and my eyes.

No, all of those transactions are signed at least by one of parties. Its just that only the last one is broadcasted into Bitcoin network. It does not pays off to broadcast earlier ones since they are less profitable to one broadcasting.

Thank you for detailed answer! I don't agree with most of your points though.
Ad. "Bitcoin is useless". 
There are two obvious points here: a) you are rich (as in top 10% of world population rich) and people like you (and me) have all the access to banking services they want. But note that most of the world does not and banking services are very expensive. Bitcoin is much more cheaper and it's an open system, on which you can build whatever you want. Good luck dealing with banks when you want to create something new. b) you see it as a consumer, not technologist or ideologist.
Ad. "Get rich scheme for ugly people". 
This is funny because I detest those guys too. Please note that it also democratizes access to money and money services. It's more opportunities in hands of ALL people, not just financial elites.
Now to failing part.
Ad. 3. Today governments are fixing problems of elites using money of masses. Don't look at mechanisms or intentions. Better check out results. American companies are doing better then ever while middle class is shrinking. Fat cats of Greece also got our dry (somehow they got information about gov plans). Quantitative easing? That's a joke. Will world of Bitcoin be fairer? Not sure, but there is a chance. BTW, libertarians are babies with minds of babies. Their perfect free market world is a world where man has full human rights under condition that that man is John Rockefeller.
Ad. I have no idea how much Bitcoin will be worth tomorrow. I've invested small sum of money and I don't care that much if I will lose it. Those who invested all of their money are gamblers. It's a problem with their character, with belief that you can overnight become rich and that would make you happy. I think that it does not matter if BTC will crash. Even if it never existed they would just gamble somewhere else.

Lightning exists on test network. You can use it today.
People who don't have money to perform a single transaction on Bitcoin don't have a problem with lack of political rights, they have a problem with extreme poverty. Bitcoin does very little for them. And even if you will construct an argument why Bitcoin is useful for those people, I don't really care. I want leveled playing field for the rest of the world. I don't care about perfect solutions - good enough are good for me.

You might be right or wrong. This relationship is intuitive, but it does not make it right by itself. E.g. Sun orbiting Earth is pretty intuitive and completely wrong. I wonder if there are any hard numbers that could support existence or non-existence of such relationship.

Its more that just improvement over typical clearing house. Its build on top of open  protocol and that changes a lot. Since everyone can be such operator censoring will  be very hard.

Trusting computer with money is something new. When you use online banking you are trusting bank. 2FA is there to eliminate risks that are linked to computers. People don't trust computers much because current state of computing on desktops is a mess. Average user is having troubles with viruses, stability, data loss etc. Fear.
Also Bitcoin is too complicated for laymen to understand. And that means more fear. 
Also - bad rep generated by media. More fear.
Also - CCs have their problems (a lot of problems!) but they are familiar and "safe" in eyes of consumer. Lack of incentive.

Nice edgelording, bro.
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:07:22
I've gone through first page of your comment history. And I want to address some of the stuff you repeat.
SetWit is just a mallability fix. It's not a kludge and it does not introduce a middleman. All it does is empowering more complicated scripting on chain.
LN does not create a possibility to add KYC/AML. Why: because I, personally, will run a LN node that will be free of any KYC/AML, logging or surveillance. If you don't trust me to do it - run it yourself. Cost is a cost of running trimming full node.
Fees. LN is much cheaper that on-chain transactions because instead of storing every transaction on every node it will allow to store summary of changes in one's balance once a year on every node. Also, since cost of joining LN is basically a cost of owning BTC, all and everyone can be a node. This means that you have a market with supply proportional to supply of bandwidth. Two things follow: fees will be close to zero and it's impossible to make a buck on LN nodes.
I'm not really surprised you don't understand how LN works. There is no one single good explanation on the network. The simplest one starts explaining from explaining how contracts that are involved work facepalm.jpg. And community needs something this quality instead: 
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:41:45

Litecoin was useless because it was a clone of Bitcoin which was not providing anything that could not be delivered by Bitcoin.
Litecoin with SW and LN does provide such thing - potentially flawless Point-of-Sale experience. Also there is a talk about LN being able to do crosschain conversion of coins. Add ease of adoption of tools for use with Litecoin (it's a fork, after all). If this does not have potential (at least in scale of crypto world), I don't know what does.
So, 4 scenarios.
1) Litecoin adopts SW and LN, Bitcoin follows shorty after. Litecoin did its work, litecoin can rest.   
2) Litecoin adopts SW and LN, Bitcoin does not follow, Litecoin gets a lot of traction and overtakes. Stubborn miners get punished.  
3) Litecoin adopts SW and LN, Bitcoin does not follow, Litecoin fails to get traction. Nothing changes.  
4) Litecoin fails to adopt SW and LN. Nothing changes.  
I'm fine with all of those.

Why litmus test? If SegWit will not be accepted by Bitcoin, and Litecoin will have both SegWit and LN, it's not a litmus test. It's a reason to sell BTC, buy LTC and start using it for payments. I'm not interested in protecting investment of miners who block SegWit. BTC is nice, but today it's pretty expensive to use. Nostalgia is not enough to keep me invested.

Learned about Litecoin somewhere in 2011. Was a huge fan of it for a while. Next understood that every software can be replicated in hardware. For a long time claimed that its useless and whole "Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver" meme is retarded. Today I write contracts in Solidity and work on distributed networks. I forgot all I could about small, useless Litecoin.
Now I see Litecoin as a way of getting SegWit and LN. Be it on Litecoin network, or Bitcoin network. It's useful again.

Insecurity. People are too lazy / stupid to have their own opinion. So they have to rely on others opinions. "But those other people might be wrong? And I've invested so much!" Next comes rationalization. People start to invent "whys" that explain why risk they took is in fact a great move. This involves inflating of chosen option and shitting on rejected options. My personal solution - diversify the risk, don't stay too attached, think and study hard.
Ethereum is great because it exists and it is actually used by people in its small niche of smart contracts. Ethereum and Bitcoin are wildly different beasts with different goals. People who think about both in terms of BTC and ETH instead of goals and risks are morons.

Bitcoin has fees (explicit cost of network maintenance) and block reward (implicit cost of network maintenance).  
Cash has implicit costs - cost of storing, moving, securing, printing cash. Additional implicit cost - QE.  
CCs has mostly implicit costs (at least for consumer) - merchants are paying percent of value of each transaction. Also QE.  
Paypal has both explicit and implicit costs. Transaction fees are explicit. Chargeback and fraud costs are implicit, since they apply to merchants first. Also QE.

Few random questions.
1) It seems that encrypted SMS is used as data channel and private keys are stored in device itself. With average transaction being ~500 bytes long and single SMS being able to carry up to 160 bytes how much additional costs will it generate for user? Free SMS plan is a thing, but I'm not sure if it is widespread.
2) This is an SPV wallet. Does it use same nodes other SPV wallets are using?
3) It seems to require some kind of SPV-to-sms gateway. Who is paying for that?
4) All communication is done in two directions: gateway-2-mobile and mobile-2-gateway. There is no direct mobile-2-mobile comms?

BTC savers are important right now only because they finance operations of miners. Miners right now are not THAT important. Network can be cut in half and still be one the comparable level of safety.

Real instant transactions without risk of double spend, micro transactions, scaling. And LN removes need for huge block sizes (whitepaper gives figure of 144MiB blocks to serve needs of whole humanity).
All those are pretty real, but they require a lot of work on level of LN nodes and wallets. It also requires that receiver is online when transaction is both initiated and finalized, which is not true for Bitcoin (apart from the fact that address generation is usually done per transaction and by receiver).

If you can do micro-transactions, you also can do normal transactions. Amount of money that can be send in one transaction is limited only by amount of money you have (or you hold in 2-2 multisig, in case of LN). You really don't understand how it works.

Increasing block limit is not the only mean of scaling Bitcoin as payment network. It's simply not sufficient as it stands. Nor staying at small block size and raising fees. There are few other ways, Lightning Network and sidechains being onces that are being talked about.

Payment channels aggregate transactions between two parties. So instead of 100 or so transactions between you and Starbucks next door only one output will hit the blockchain when the channel will get closed. Single channel can exist for long period of time (a year) and single person will need only one channel.

Two points.
a) You, yourself is stuck in cold-war mentality. Nobody should care about West vs Russia or think in such terms. Russia is an economical dwarf, lead by a guy who gets all of his information from "Channel One Russia". Whole thing has ended years ago. USA has won, not that it has done it any good (my bet: USA will suffer 30 years of agony and will have a revolution next). As for Putin's own achievements - even Poland pisses on Russia today. Whole "we control the gas and oil" argument is gone because Russia can no longer decide whom to sell or not to sell. EU has a network of interconnections which causes that selling to one is equal to selling to everyone. EU can act as one, and that means that Russia has no longer any power to affect EU.
b) What kind of argument is that? Let's all judge ourself by lowest common denominator. "I'm fine, I'm still better than Kim Jong Un!"

1) all I see is comment by 2) even assuming that reports conversation that happened, it's clear who in that conversation is right, and it's not todu  
3) talk is about defamation suit under Swedish law; this has nothing to do with Bitcoin, Bitcoin network, or Bitcoin core source code. Ergo, nothing to do with possible fork of Bitcoin  
Since that is what you've chosen as a proof of Bitstream unethical behavior, I conclude that either you are dumb as nail, or (which is far more probable) you are dishonest.

Yes, you are very wrong. Your public address is just a number and people who are sending you money need to know that number and nothing more.
Example: comboy whiskey fund  
Donation page:  (see bottom of the page)  
Address:   
If you want to generate new public addresses for every incoming transaction (this does not leak total amount of donations or money that are moving through your hands), you may use normal hot wallet or you can use XPUB address. XPUB is "mirror" of HD wallet. HD wallets can generate tree of single use addresses (private and public key pairs) and are basically a standard in modern wallets. XPUB is a receive-only, peek-only counterparts of HD wallet. It can generate a tree of public addresses, basing on specially prepared transformation of seed of HD wallet. This feature is available in different wallets (I've used it MyTrezorLite, apparently mycelium also supports it).

Everything what could be wrong was wrong at that particular Point of Sale. Cashier has no reasons to wait for block being mined. It was a Pizza place, not car dealership. Transaction delivery is enough.
In place where I often spent my BTC, cashier sees "trasaction confirmed" message from PoS application which means that transaction was delivered. Cashier do not need to know technical details - seeing "confirmed" is enough.
Pizza place owner did poor job at training cashiers and at picking PoS application.

Fortunately technical barriers and financial requirements needed to become a provider of services in Lightning Network are rather low.
Also - since Bitcoin is used as underlying medium, every user can switch provider of payment channel or just go and use Bitcoin as p2p network.
Some potential for abuse exists, but it's very low. Totally incomparable with levels of abuse demonstrated by PayPal and banks.

Those actions and words are only a smokescreen. 
In Russia government officials do not give a flying fuck about government's raison d'etre. So any regulation in Russia has only three possible real goals:  
1) short-term tactical goals (e.g. destruction of personal enemy; [tracks covering]( etc)  
2) [stealing money]( from gov't budget  
3) ass covering (making noise to show that you are doing something)  
In this particular case this is just noise. **Russian leaders don't have strategy, they have tactics only.** This government is doomed: economics of Russia is diving down, and all ways of fixing situation are broken beyond repair. No law, no media, no civil society - no mechanisms to prevent the fall. 
So people in government have only two ways today. First one is North Korea way - more isolation, more propaganda, more terror. Second way - stealing as much money as possible and emigrating to EU. To prevent such outcome and exert more pressure on those fuckers publications about their [dirty money]( are needed.

No, I'm not upset. I hear that impotent drivel about "mah imaginary property rights are being stolen!" all the time.
I genuinely believe that whole thing is a service problem. Content not being available pronto means it will be retrieved by other means. Do a good service and you will be rolling in money. Examples are plenty. But this service is not available universally. It's really hard to buy music, movies and e-books online in most of countries on Earth. Kickass torrents were not taking business from Netflix or Hulu - rather they've divided market into two parts: one served by first two, and rest of the world served by Kickass. Every person shouting about theft should instead be raving about ineptitude of people and organizations who do awful job of distributing their content. 
And one more thing for you. Global nature of market and limited amount of consumption power of single being (there is only so much free hours in a day) mean that income of artists will be shaped by power law. E.g. 0 USD to 99% of authors, 100 USD to 0.99% of authors and 1M USD to 0.01% of authors. This basically mean that your entitlement to income from your "artistic endeavors" is one of tho things. You are either very lucky and actually make money (so don't complain) OR you don't make any money and talk about piracy is protection mechanism.
In both cases you must be dumb as ton of bricks.

My "rebuttal" was not addressing main points of your post. Instead now we are in area where you need to determine how economic indicators are calculated and stuff. Do not want.
Instead - I agree with you that Bitcoin cannot be controlled by government by increasing or reducing amount of money on market. 
Tell me please: was it used even once to save wallets of middle and lower class? Most of the time rich get away with money while everyone else is paying the cost. In theory government is controlled by people. In practice - by well connected, rich and mentally damaged group of people.
So what is the use of tool that cannot be used for well being of general population?

I've experienced propagation time that was closer to 15 minutes first hand. It's awkward. Although most of the time it's instant.

Your example does not stand. So economy grows, but you are not a part of it because the only party who is gaining is the owner of the printer.
