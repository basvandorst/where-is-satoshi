I guess I was the first to ask. The more people who do they'll think about it more seriously I guess.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:53:31
This is my plan.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:17:43
Buy the dips!
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:51:06
Very cool
@_date: 2013-03-19 06:51:00
Why thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-19 14:58:15
I can think of a number of reasons why. 
I think the biggest factor why they don't use it is because they haven't seen a demand for it. It sounds like I was the first person to ask about it. I don't think they may be aware of the adoption of it etc. More demand would make them research and make the right choice ;)

So they act as an escrow service? Never knew how it worked. My mental picture of these transactions is a lot bleaker. Good to hear experiences.

@_date: 2013-02-21 06:20:29
It seems so. I don't mind growing pains too much. It looks like their trying to honour all the people who contact their support.
@_date: 2013-03-12 23:55:29
This makes perfect sense!
@_date: 2013-03-16 03:28:46
Triple your upvotes forever.

Reddit is fucking awesome.
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:19:00
Looks like things are being worked out. We'll see at around ~3PM PST :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:52:15
Most excellent!
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:12:39
This can only be positive. Finding out issues like this will only make the software/network better.
Open source FTW!
@_date: 2013-03-27 05:52:22
This is cool.
@_date: 2013-03-20 05:13:36
Thank you :)
@_date: 2013-06-23 20:39:07
So Bitcoin is money. Thanks for the clarification California.
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:09:51
I love this.
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:17:41
Support contacted me - coins should come through sometime soon!
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:35:37
Satoshi is like a real life Batman
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:11:31
They've just got in contact now. Crazy hour but appreciate it. They're going process the order tomorrow. Sweet :)
@_date: 2013-03-05 15:26:52
Won't cashing out depreciate the value of the remaining coins in your wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:10:32
The latter point can be solved through n-of-m transactions with independent arbitrators.
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:13:53
Tip me 10 btc :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:49:11
10 coins please - that will do me good :)
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:18:23
I'm glad their resolving issues like this.
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:51:42
I'm being a n00b. Wat?
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:30:54
Everything is fine.
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:11:28
Kill them werewolves!
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:45:09
Me too. Just looking finding some comic relief.
It looks like there could be a buying opportunity.
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:19:28
Thanks :) They've contacted me after I tweeted at them :)
@_date: 2013-03-05 15:29:10
But if lots of people had that mentality it would right?
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:34:16
Tweeting at them seems to get a response!
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:37:02
Don't just stop using a particular exchange – set one up.
@_date: 2013-02-20 20:19:27
How fast were their support response? I emailed them this morning Eastern.
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:17:57
Thanks for the suggestions.
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:35:53
I found tweeting at them with your case number get's their attention.
Had my issue resolved in an hour after tweeting.
@_date: 2013-02-22 02:30:55
I felt that too. Is that another psychological number.
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:11:57
What is this?
@_date: 2013-03-10 18:12:34
I can't reply on that thread? Is it because I'm a n00b?
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:30:04
No unless you're really, really, really, really, really clever and figure out what you can use them for.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:54:47
The correction is correcting!
