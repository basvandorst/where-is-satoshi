I don't understand how you can consider accepting bitcoin...
It's like considering whether or not your business wants more customers and money.
You can accept bitcoin and only ever see the USD.

If there really is a chatbox and I get someone from there I'll give you the bounty, can you screenshot it or something?

Thank you, where can I find bter chat. If it works I'll feel compelled to tip!
Tried to google it but can't find it, can't immediately see it on their site either

I'm currently having issues accessing my account, so far no response from there anywhere.
Not on QQ.
Not on bitcointalk on any of the three addresses.
Not on either email.

Good idea. However I can't as I'm a newbie there (though my account was registered in april). Also that account hasn't been active in 10 days! Their other two accounts (bter and bter.com) haven't been active since may
Thanks for helping me out here btw
