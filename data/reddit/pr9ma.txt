It's cool. He's just old. I'm sure if he really understood the concept he would be on board. Give him a break.

I'm also accepting a variety of crypto-currencies. If you act now you can be a naughty little thing and make my eyes dilate &amp; hair stand on end by tipping me in any currency. I will be the happiest boy in this merry-o-land. And that's a fact Jack.

I've seen gold/silver available for purchase with BTC on Silkroad.
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:42:39
Oh, well that's a good thing! Thank you again.

I'm helping with [DigiClick]( which is a [DigitalCoin]( (DGC) advertising platform and looking to take off when DGC does in the next week. There is a community and awesome dev behind this coin, so check it out before you bash it, because this coin is set to go places! Check out the ad platform and DGC...you'll be doing yourself a favor if you buy some DGC now. It will pass FTC in a week and LTC in a month!

U.S. here. Can still view the site as of now.

I too agree that this is what Bitcoin really needs. It needs a service like that of which PayPal has. But I don't think that service needs to be Paypal itself. There needs to be a fresh trustworthy upstart that will fill this hole.

Dangit! I tried bro.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:54:02
What does it feel like to get tipped?
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:03:29
Whoa at the large tips! Go Bitcoin!
I have never had a tip. :(

I just made an acct with 'reddit200' as the affiliate. Checked the account and there's no funds there. There is however 20000.00 in play money. Am I dong something wrong? Thanks in advance...Hope it'll work.
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:50:52
Ty my friend!
I've tried mining, but no luck on this laptop. :(

Where do you find a no legged dog?
Right where you left him.

You've also spent how much money on your setup?
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:58:38
Is there a site like the gem site but for people with smaller amounts of BTC? Like .01 bets like SatoshiDice?
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:23:23
how generous! once i have BTC's i will do the same.
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:06:49
I completely and totally envy you sir. Very nice pics!
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:29:00
It's going back up. I predict it to be 130-140 in a week.
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:01:24
I have a Win7 laptop with an Intel 4000 HD. Not bad for gaming, but not for mining. I get 15 Kh/s at -I at 13.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:02:23
I'll let you use my bike for .05 BTC/week. Deal?
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:54:35
Wow, thanks!
@_date: 2013-06-03 17:39:01
BTC is wayyy off since yesterday. Was that your master plan? ;)
@_date: 2013-04-30 00:46:57
I was j/k srry. Tho if you're ever in GA. I could give you a bike, and you could tip me in BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:30:02
I look at SatoshiDice as a big stress test being run on the BTC network. If it can handle SD, it can handle anything. It would suck if BTC got so big that we DDoS'd ourselves to death, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:27:31
I'm laughing at one of the comments on the video, would give this guy something for just making me laugh!...
Please, help me! I'm broke and starving. I keep warm by the heat given off by my BTC mining rig that mines at an epic 15 Kh/s! Satoshi if you're out there, somewhere in the cloud, rain your Bitcoins down upon﻿ me oh revered and invisible one! Please fill my wallet with BTC so I can buy hookers and blow from SR!
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:03:48
I'm not sure what this post was about. Whatever was there has been [DELETED]. From what I gather from the edits are that you made a lot of BTC with Satoshi Dice and can't stop gambling. Gambling is an addiction and I used to suffer from drug addiction. Listen to the words of someone who has conquered this demon. You are stronger than any desire that you have. You don't have to live in bondage of addiction, whether it be heroin or gambling. Ask for help, and it will be given. I hope you have quashed this thing by now, but if not don't give up. You can do it. If you ever need anything please pm me.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:46:02
Well hook me up with half the pot, since I'm halfway there! :) *wink* *nudge*
I'm a poor struggling BTC miner, mining on a laptop for gawd's sake!
I want BTC's so badly...
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:35:46
Well said. That is what I'm doing now, but not getting any desirable results...1 LTC/month. It's more of a hobby I guess. Maybe I'll build a rig when I get some cash.
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:10:35
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.
@_date: 2013-05-20 14:02:45
I don't have but .02 BTC right now, but I try to tip when I feel a post is worth it. :)
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:32:20
You gotta take the @ off pr9me for that to work. And thank you! Such cool ppl on this /r (:
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:55:35
Wow, I'm so envious, but urge you to walk away now. I have made .04 BTC from my .01 BTC that I was tipped on here. I'm tempted to keep betting on SD but have made myself quit.
