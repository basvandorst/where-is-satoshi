it is so obvious , thrust down our throats
could it be bait for bitcoiners 
could it be that they want us to dump turds so they could buy
could it be that they are worried about their retirement money on the islands , somebody should just comfort these octogenarians and whisper in their ears that hyperbitcoinization will take some time yet , and even so their paper stash may have other uses , without going into the (b)anal like them , eg wallpaper for a beautiful Dollar Room

now.....the governments are confiscating cash
soon......everything you own will be known via a.....blockchain by google, by amazon, by facebook by your government
land....,is fine,  but statelessness and pseudonomity/anonimity of your wealth/"money" is nirvana

eg something like rootstock:
Rootstock will exist as a Bitcoin sidechain. If you haven’t heard of the sidechains proposal you can review the whitepaper here, or read our explanation of sidechains here. But in summary a sidechain is a blockchain that is separate from the main Bitcoin Blockchain, but assets can be transferred back and forth. That is, we can send some BTC to the sidechain and then when we no longer need them on the sidechain send them back to the main chain. This allows innovation without the worry that the investment will wither to nothing as it was the case with hundreds of alt-coins. As a result of being a sidechain Rootstock will not issue a new currency or token. Instead in order to pay for Rootstock transactions there will be a two way peg between the native Rootstock token called RTC, and bitcoin. To transact on the RSK platform one simply transfers BTC to the sidechain, which locks them and then unlocks an equivalent amount of RTC on the Rootstock platform. To transfer back the process is repeated in reverse. RTC are locked and BTC are unlocked."

over here (like everywhere) the government steals 5 dollar tax money for every dollar spent on infrastructure, schools , roads etc
my country is unstable , crime is extravagant....
Frankly I had the need to  have an immediate borderless pseudonomous (hopefully soon anonomous) means to transfer funds into the cyber space and if need be to family in another country......immediate, no permission to be asked , no useless nincompoop charging a % for his "effort" etc etc

A broken system dont last forever.There is an acceleration of state control over personal finances, subtle "tax" by Visa , Amazon etc and likely behind the scene obsecene collaboration between state and global companies-and between governments
The existence of btc is pure genius--but the exponential acceptance of btc is rather the expression of need of a fed-up "sovereign individual" population all over the world . The need is multifactorial, perhaps like in my country embezzlement of my taxes(for every dollar paid ,I get little or no benefit) , in other countries there may be many different reasons. Greece Argentina Venezuela Zimbabwe .Certainly dark money is also flowing in .So what?
You earn money , the state inflate the paper money.
Gold is a store of value, but has its own issues.....not transportable with ease etc
So lets hope, and that is where my optimism comes from, that good money will drive out the bad , that fiat will become so worthless that btc holders wont accept it , that concrete stores of value will become the method of exchange for btc....that btc can only be bought by gold , by art , by electricity. That dollars /fiat will maelstrom down that faucet into oblivion. ( and hopefully with that power hungry war mongererers--the scoundrels of the world)
That local cryptocurrency/btc will become the norm

the real story , unedited!
"Signs of froth are everywhere. US high-grade companies, which have already sold almost $1trn of bonds this year, are on track to break old issuance records. By some measures, corporate America is deeper in debt than ever before. Junk bonds, yielding on average just 5.8%, have fallen close to post-crisis lows.
And on Friday, investors lined up in droves to provide $1.8bn in financing to Elon Musk’s unprofitable electric carmaker, Tesla - and at interest rates that few could have envisioned a couple of years ago.
For Eaton Vance’s Kathleen Gaffney, it adds up to a market with all the hallmarks of a mishap waiting to happen."
“It can be hard to know the exact moment of a top but the signs are clearly there,” said Gaffney, who’s been buying and selling bonds for more than three decades, after starting her career at Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co. “People are ignoring the fundamentals and taking a big leap of faith.”

glad for you

but please dont ask a financial advisor, their lack of knowledge is hilarious
I just throw some bait now and then when I need a good chuckle

Luno is closely linked with Naspers , Naspers has a huge stake in Tencent. ViaBTC is a side project of Tencent .Bitcoin Cash is a project of ViaBtc.Tencent is also developing some sort of cryptocurrency platform
Connecting the dots......

now if we generalize this:
all potential buyers buy Satoshis for the month end expenses. By the time they get to the shop the Satoshis are worth 5% more ,They still have ready dollars--from the salary .So they rather use dollars and hodl the Satoshis. The grocer who was hoping to get Satoshis gets dollars .Basically the local commerce keeps running on dollars and the dollars channeled into btc are either used for large transactions or hodled.If the grocer is really keen on btc , he will increase the dollar price of his goods by a % more than the btc /dollar increase to attract btc into his business.However if he gets his hands on btc , he will also hodl--as he knows he is artificially inflating the price of his goods

Warren Ingram and Jenna Wright!
If you woke them at 3 am and ask them how bitcoin works and what is a blockchain etc etc ....I would like to see 
Bet they did not even knew a thing about btc till 1 year ago

slightly alarmist , but likely true. 
If there is big money , centralized system there will always be a back door for somebody to shaft somebody

‘It might be that while observing the due ceremonial of everyday market transactions we are in fact observing capital flows resultin g from quantum games eluding classical description. If human decisions can be traced to microsopic quantum events one would expect thatnature would have taken advantage of quantum computation in evolving complex brains.  In thatsense one could indeed say that quantum computers are playing their market games according to quantum rules"
