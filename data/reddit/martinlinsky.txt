Another aspect is the IOER preventing the FFR from being more effective in increasing AD.

tl;dr 
Based on the concept of Gresham's Law, when two currencies have a fixed exchange rate by law, and the market exchange rate deviates from this government-mandated rate, the undervalued money will disappear from circulation. However, based on research of several currencies in the U.S. economy's history, along with negative interest rates being implemented with the War on Cash, it is quite possible that not only will physical cash circulate along side electronic dollars, but will exchange at a significant premium, thus creating an opportunity for savers and investors to actually profit from this unfortunate circumstance.

That's not what I meant by floor lol I mean a price floor. There's technically nothing stopping it from dropping to 1 cent or a fraction of a cent. This is true with several assets, but those have consumptive anchors to stabilize its price whereas Bitcoin does not.
Money is best when it's reasonably stable. Bitcoin has shown zero evidence it can do so. 
Cryptos may be the future, Bitcoin may not be.

Until then, you have conjecture.


This is no way related to what we're talking about.


1. The same could be said for housing as of 2006.
2. Bailouts are not determined by debt levels alone. They are determined politically. If streaming companies as a market fell severely enough, it's quite conceivable that they could lobby for bailouts despite the fact that streaming companies aren't debt-based in their operations.
3. The demand for bitcoin is based on people's ability and desire to buy them with dollars. The dollar system is itself a debt based system. During recessions and downturns, people have less income and more debt in dollar terms, thus have less ability to purchase them. You havn't considered this.


Youre confusion here makes me curious, yes. So I'll restate it. Bitcoin recently appreciated significantly, thus if it were the main currency, as we discussed, there would be sudden and violent deflation of prices, and umemployment.
On the other hand, when bitcoin fell from about $1200 to around $300 that would have caused a severe INFLATION of prices and as you stated: 
 &gt;that people DO accept lower real wages, as long as there is a rise in nominal wages.
So by you're own admission, bitcoin has not solved the inflation problem. People who would accept being paid in bitcoin would accept lower REAL wages even if their nominal wages are rising.
In either case of inflation or deflation with bitcoin, the market and consumers are hurt. That was my point all along. And its historical volatility is EVIDENCE of this.


I answered that already:


You seem to skip certain parts of my statements and then question them out of context.
 
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:54:11
Not independent of it's exchange utility. Hence the chronic volatility. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:18:18
Dropping to less than 1% of its value in a second may be something to worry about. You've never seen that happen to another currency so quickly and violently. Ever.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:46:42
No. I'm saying it has no consumptive anchor. Hence the volatility. 
For future reference if your going to propose evidence, it would benefit you to provide some from a site that doesn't actually sell the thing you're supporting. Lol
And I'm not against Bitcoin per se, it's just not a good money since its speculative traits outweigh its exchange traits. It has no floor.

Straw man 
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:25:59
This article never said its dead.
It can fall extremely low just like tulips did.
But tulips didn't disappear.
Bitcoin is not a great money because of volatility.
You missed that point because you're too busy attacking a straw man.
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:38:04
Not editing, just copy and pasting. Your exact quotes. If you cant refute my original points then thats your m.o.
Your views do unfortunately. You own an asset, and part of your financial well being hinges on that asset appreciating. To deny that is disingenuous.
I dont have to call you biased. You just are.
And I hope it does go up. I like crypto currencies. Youre just celebrating too soon, that's all.
No hard feelings.
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:46:41
It hadn't been disproven. Bitcoin is speculative. Metals weren't. Bitcoin is bought now mainly for its rise in price. Metals were mainly used in exchange.
Not stability in price. You're seeing what you want to see, not what's there. 
You own cryptos correct?

Its that you dont understand my point(or have not demonstrated you do). Markets can fall just like bitcoin, BUT those markets are for goods that have CONSUMPTIVE properties. Bitcoin does not. It suffers from indirect exchange without having an "anchor" to stabilize it's market price.
My evidence is its CHRONIC volatility. No other markets have it like that. Not much you can do to refute that.


No but it stopped the bleeding didnt it? If you honestly think that the government would "bailout' bitcoin, then I will concede this point. But you and I both know you dont believe that.


Again, this adds nothing to the conversation.


Please find my quote where I said I did as well as bitcoin. Hint: I didnt. This is your second strawman.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:36:03
Bitcoin has been around less than a decade.  You have no frame of reference. Past monies lasted for hundreds of thousands of years. 
Economists don't argue with such short time horizons or price points as you have.
It has no consumptive anchor. Hence the chronic volatility since its birth. Case closed.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:35:16
Not a fan of chronic volatility. And if a crypto is affected so severely and quickly merely due to "cunning or naive" or "not recognizing risk and vulnerability", then it's a shaky foundation.


Perhaps, but it has no floor. I'd rather wait until it's exchange properties outweigh its speculative properties.

*empty assertion that adds nothing
Thanks for playing. Don't let the door hit you!
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:12:59
Not an argument 
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:52:34
Not sure of your point. 
A currency's exchange value is based on consumptive purposes. It's why other metals have been used as money other than gold.
Bitcoin is extremely volatile. So any utility you mention of crypto has thus far not shown to stabilize its value which is the whole point of a currency.
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:29:24


I never said they weren't.




Well which is it? lol Youre giving anecdotes. Im saying the housing MARKET has a floor because the government wont let them fall below a certain level, and again housing is a consumption good(durable) in economic terms, thus making shelter(housing) always commanding a price, unlike bitcoin who has none.


I hope you know this is ALSO an argument against bitcoin as well. For if the opposite happens, and bitcoin falls in value, then lower real wages in terms of bitcoin will be accepted by a sudden fall in its value, thus destroying peoples' purchasing power.
Currencies should be allowed to fluctuate a bit in price, but in a severely chronic way like bitcoin has is detrimental to the economy.


I don't think you do understand. Because if you did, you'd see that abstracting from the financial sector(and only looking at the real economy), sudden violent inflation/deflation(in other words volatility) of the kind we're seeing in bitcoin creates the prisoner's dilemma for businesses and thus lower employment and wages for consumers. But you have ignored that since you started posting. So the financial sector is beside the point.
That's what monetary theory is about. Relative prices and how the price mechanism works.


If thats true then why arent I attacking other stocks and investments that have done better than mine(mine have done pretty well but not amazing)? I have no problem buying bitcoin again WHEN THE PRICE STABILIZES and it proves to be a sound money. It hasnt shown that thus far.


Bitcoin can't scale to replace the dollar any time soon. But the idea of building cryptographic backed business processes, and building reserves of value backed by cryptographic proofs will radically change everything. I believe for the better.
Im inclined to agree in the long run. Just dont mistake a bubble for genuine growth as a reliable currency.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:20:33


True. Tulips have a consumptive anchor. Cryptos don't.


Are they both manias?
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:14:26


No because they were used as money UNIVERSALLY. Bitcoin is not.


1. stability means predictability over a period of time. Bitcoin is less than 10 years old. Youre celebrating is the same as home buyers in 2006. A bit premature to say the least. At least homes have a price floor.
2. Thought experiment. Imagine bitcoin was THE currency of the U.S. The dollar was gone(for whatever reason). And bitcoin just doubled in price this year alone. What does that do to business profits in terms of selling prices. They fall. But people dont accept lower nominal wages(in terms of dollars or bitcoins). 
So if business prices plummet in terms of an appreciating bitcoin, and costs(particularly labor costs) remain the same, then businesses become unprofitable. This is what hurts an economy.
If you understand monetary theory and deflation, you'll get this important point. Youre only thinking of your own economic position when looking at it, which is expected, but is why true economists dont make that mistake.


It makes you biased. Not a terrible thing but biased nonetheless. And I discovered bitcoin within a year of its inception and bought it at $0.08, then sold it later on to pay bills. Im confident I was aware of its concept well before you. So I wouldnt play that game if I was you. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:05:21
No but it's telling how bad of a driver you are even when no ones around, kind of like how faulty a certain crypto may be.

Indeed. Except tulips have a consumptive anchor. Hence:
