* How would the bot handle cases where for example you set a price reminder for 20000, but the price jumped from 19999.95 to 20000.15 for example... would the reminder still go off?
* Also, once the reminder triggers, does the reminder disable? For example I set a reminder for 20000, but then the price fluctuated over and under 20000 five times within the span of 1 minute... will I get 1 reminder or 5 reminders?

Once I double my capital I'm withdrawing half so that I'm automatically at break even and at zero loss whatever happens. The price I need to reach that is $25,000, so I'm selling half my BTC when it hits that price.
After that, it's just HODL indefinitely for me.

If the current rise plateaus around 13k, then I don't think we'll see sub-10k in the near future.

But it was not designed to be an investment.

Does this mean that if cryptocurrency prospers, fiat loses and crashes? Does that mean that if this happens, the value we've put into fiat-based investments will devalue and we should start converting all of our assets to crypto?
Is there no scenario where fiat and crypto can co-exist?

GDAX flirting with 11k. At 10970 right now. Hit a high of 10984 half an hour ago.

If bitcoin crashes and burns out soon then we're late adopters.
If bitcoin prospers and becomes a game changer then we're still early adopters.
