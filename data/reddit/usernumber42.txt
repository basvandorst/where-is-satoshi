I get that top level description, but I don't get *why* it is structured like that. How do previous transaction connect with a new block?
@_date: 2012-11-28 17:11:03
I'm someone who is completely new to this, so please excuse my ignorance. Why is this a good thing? Why are people happy that mining a block is less profitable now? Wouldn't this be a bad thing?

Can someone explain what these blocks are to me? I don't get how they apply to buying and selling bit coins. I read the FAQ and Getting Started guide and I get that when a new block is discovered that the discoverer gets 25 bitcoins, but what is the deal with transaction fees and blocks being records of past transactions. I don't get how they apply at all. Can someone explain this to me starting with the very basics?

I'm still confused as to why generating new bit coins is tied to transactions with already existing bit coins. I don't get how a block applies to regular transactions. So every 10 minutes a new block is created, that block contains all the information of all the transactions that happened since the last block? If that's true, how do past blocks come into play? I'm sorry I'm so clueless, it's just not clicking. Thanks for taking the time to explain it to me.

Thanks so much. I think I'm starting to grasp it. Can a situation occur where everybody is paying fees so no non-fee transactions get approved?

Yes... because no one has purchased drugs with USDs ever...

Just a warning, this isn't a "normal" stock. Each share represents 200MH/s of mining power. It
s not like ASICMiner where you get a cut of the profits. Here you get a certain amount of power. They can sell more shares and they oddly only trade on an exchange that they themselves created. Overall, it seems legit, but be careful.

They aren't BTC exclusive. Do you still want me to answer your other questions?

GPU Miners will be obsolete soon with ASICs coming in. There was a "what are you investing in?" thread earlier and the top comment was about HIM fund that pays out monthly what ASICMiner pays out weekly and that trades for around 2BTC/share. The long term value of ASICMiner stock, in my opinion, is worth far more than a couple of graphics cards that will be worthless by the end of the year.

Consistent weekly near 1% dividends (forget about the latest one) is unheard of. If they weren't so well respected in the community I would think it's a scam. Right now, it's a great buy. I disagree with you.
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:56:26
Agreed. They do have standing in the community and it's a couple guys who recently took over the company. I think given time they will do well. They aren't the only ones who do this but they are the only ones who are listed on a major BTC Trading exchange. It's the only hosting company I know I can invest in while I pay for something that I need. With incentives like that I see it growing. Growing slowly, but growing.

As I said in other threads, I see slow and steady growth. They are known in the community and have a presence on bitcointalk. They are the only hosting company on the exchange. Two guys recently took over the company and are slowly turning it around. Once they start paying dividends I see the price going up. I think it's a good long term buy.

Don't take it to some ridiculous extreme because one incident happened. 2 factor is essential and anyone who doesn't have it protecting their money is foolish. Online, nothing is 100% safe. Nothing. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be safe. 2 factor solves a lot of problems, not 100%, but a lot.
@_date: 2013-05-21 14:20:35
Which is still a great investment.
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:57:14
Of course, that goes for any stock ever. I think it will be worth more in the future which is why I'm not selling my shares.

I think BITVPS is a good long term hold. The stock is super cheap right now and if they are known in the community as the best place for VPS hosting. I think it will be a slow and stead rise to the top.
