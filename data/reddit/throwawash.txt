Moral is what we call moral, there cannot be an objective answer to the OP question as the answer is inherently about our subjective brains and experiences. The universe just is, it's not good or bad is my bottom line. All arguments that I was exposed to regarding objective morality have so far turned out to be circular.

What we are seeing is nothing more than actors enforcing their own choices upon the network. Nodes process transactions based on their proof of cryptographic coherence. Now, they are also discriminating transactions based on what they decide is congruous with their personal criteria. In reality, nodes are constantly verifying proof of work/stake/whatever the proof du jour is, this is just an example of actors adding one more proof on top of that to accept transactions.
This is just really begging for the design of a blockchain relying on **proof of consensus** to manage transactions at the user level, with clients being able to tolerate discrepancies and microforks across the blockchain. You could rate another actor's congruency with your own choices, and determine which "world" to live in and who you can and can't transact with.

That means that they obviously they do want to help the helpless. I gave some money to a guy in the street today, so obviously SOME people do want to help them. They don't just feel like taking money out of their own wallet to give it to individuals is better than contributing to an organised, mass-scale project that does the same while getting much more bang for your buck. It's also why people give to charities. Obviously, personal initiative and charities are not sufficiently funded or well organised to really make a dent on these problems. The free market is not doing its job.
The Church, for instance, used to do a much better job at social care. Of course, those times are long gone, but that's an example of a centralised, monopolistic institution outside of the market economy doing a much better job than any free market could have done.

This is absolutely insane. I have trouble even believing the news. It reads like dystopian fiction, but it's real: a privately owned bank will be sharing its office space with publicly elected representatives. Lobbying on crack.

You let the thief go away? I don't want to transact with you.
You thought BTER was "too big to fail"? I don't want to transact with you.
Granted, the consequences are quite drastic in the present case of splitting the blockchain in half, but we can see something like distributed legal systems and consensus-enforced contracts emerging.
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:30:30
I think the evidence here is compellingly in favour of the scenario presented by BTER, but I see what you mean and there is definitely merit in the notion of not entirely trusting the narrative that is being pushed in any given scenario.
The thing is, nothing that would happen if the fork happened would be anything that is not happening already. Nodes select transactions and push them onto the network, the majority of which form the consensus-based history. Majority voting is happening all the time already, and the present scenario would only be an affirmation of this principle.
Besides, regardless of how this turns out, this will happen again and again in crypto-currency. There is no real "precedent" to set here, because the outcome of this will not change the certainty for people to have to make this choice again. So, why not set an example of a community taking the initiative in cohesion to rally for the common good and protect its currency and blockchain from unauthorised attacks?

Essentially, you will be creating your own "TostaderoCoin" and sell it to your investors.
This is in essence an IPO.
You can then automatically distribute your dividends to the addresses holding TostaderoCoin, in a proportion you decide.
You will likely decide to distribute for example 50% of the dividends to your company (because you kept 50% of the TostaderoCoins), 10% to some next biggest holder (he holds 10%), 1% to whoever is holding that much, and so on.
Be careful with whatever laws you have in your country, because there are often rules and restrictions around the creation and distribution of shares.
All the usual options will be available to you: you can issue more shares, dilute them, increase the liquidity by multiplying everybody's shares by a common factor, etc...

You have to look at how well homicides have been recorded throughout history.

That's just a very reductive and simplistic way to look at it... The trust you'd be putting in the devs is to step in and give a hand if that ever happened, not oversee and verify 100% of the network transactions in an obfuscated way. Also, the software is open sourced.

You hit the nail right on the head.
It's amazing to see how rabidly conservative this place has become. People campaign against what they call "alt coins" in the hope that this will mean more market capitalisation for Bitcoin, and thus more money in their pocket. They sound exactly like the guys at Big Bank Inc. trying to close the floodgate.
The real innovation is happening at the edges of Bitcoin. The inventions based on the blockchain that are starting to profile are staggering for distributed computing, asset management, online publishing, censorship, democracy, and many other areas. Many people will answer "oh, all of that will be possible with Bitcoin in a future update. Sidechains will do just the job". Well, while you wait for something theoretical to happen, the technology is being pushed in other places.
Do you want to join the revolution, or are you just going to stand on the sideline, yelling at clouds? Bitcoin will not be the only popular, important blockchain around. Forget it, that was never going to happen. Is there only one brand of car? One brand of computers? One brand of shoes? By the way, what happened to those first brands? Most of them have disappeared. Just don't be so sure of your luck and keep your eyes open when change comes around. It is accelerating more and more.

@_date: 2014-11-12 23:53:55
No. You're looking at it too simplistically. Change tip is a service that runs on the decentralised network known as Bitcoin, and brings you something that could have only existed this way. 
When we get proper micro transactions one day we might see everybody publishing their wallet address and we will just tip to that directly.
There's no reason to use the Bitcoin blockchain as it is today for micro-transactions. Paying the fee every time would be too expensive, and you would bloat the blockchain with "petty" transactions.
So yeah, ChangeTip is off chain transactions managed by a central authority. But so are every wallet service (if you transfer money to an account that's also hosted on the same wallet provider), every marketplace that is not OpenBazaar, every exchange, etc...
It's OK for now and for what it needs to achieve.

It may sound vague but the value of such a platform is immense. It's REAL decentralised/cloud computing, storage, contract execution, etc...
It's a turing complete arcade machine people put their coins in to perform operations, and there's other people on the other side that perform the computation in exchange for the coin, and at any moment, those people can switch sides, or do both things.

That's a prejudicial, simplistic, and caricatural view of government. It's notorious that if all you care about is a pay check, then being employed in the government insures you long working hours and low revenue. Many people do it for a passion. Teachers, firefighters, police men. Yes, they all want their pay check as well, but it's not all they care about.
I think your criticism of ants vs humans is largely arrogant and betrays a common misconception among people, which is that because we can't understand the complex and subtle organisation, communication, and social structure of many plants and animals, then it's because they don't have one.
Regardless, then let's new another analogy: a government exists the same way a football team exists. They are part of the same group, trying to perform the same function. They're not just individuals who happened to arrive at the same time on a field and decided to throw the ball to each other.

Funny. When the government cuts funding to welfare, there are more people on the street, and nobody seems to be voluntarily picking up the bill for them. I can observe with my own eyes that that kind of liberalism doesn't work for the marginalised, and it doesn't work for the economically emancipated whose quality of life goes down in response.
Maybe it's more complicated than anarcho-capitalism. Maybe what matters most is not whatever the economical model du jour is, but the intrinsic culture and ethics people have. You know, about the Wild West. People were far more religious than today. But the writer fails to draw a correlation there. Because when you are a hammer, then every problem you see is a nail.
@_date: 2014-08-12 21:06:33
You are right. I see the world very differently.


That's because you think making more money makes you faster, and less money slower. You see the production of capital as a race, a competition that determines who is worth the most and who is last. A status and validation of worth. You put a price on life.
In reality, human society and social progress is based on precisely the opposite. It's about putting empathy first, and cooperating with one another to combat the dangers of the natural world and the natural state of anarchy of the animal kingdom. It's about accepting to have less so nobody starves out. I don't feel "slowed down" by having to give to others. That means I don't have to see homeless people scavenging for food down my street when I try to go out and have a reasonable day. Don't suffer so much because you have to share some your plate. It makes the day better for everybody.
Yeah, there are freeleechers, but don't shut down the whole system because of a few bad apples.
The great thing is that with crypto currency-based societies, we will finally have a real free market of governance and see who fares better: the people who share, and the people who cut themselves off from the network. People will be free to live in whatever kind of society they see fit. But there has to be a legal system for everybody, a level playing ground. This is where the government comes in. You can't avoid having to legislate so everybody follows the same basic rules. You can't avoid centralisation of the law.


Yes, they mostly moved for freedom and economic incentives. Society was in general more strictly religious, and morality was not as relative back then.

We're not talking about some manageable level of inflation consistent with an established currency. We're talking about the price going up 10000% in what is quite frankly a short time.

But when will we know?

The blockchain solves the problem of counterfeiting and the cases of taxation and money laundering that are enabled by counterfeiting. I never said the blockchain is a perfect model for which we have somehow solved the incompleteness theorem or something. I can however say that counterfeiting does not make sense on the blockchain. The end.
@_date: 2014-10-18 23:33:18
That makes it way more fair, but I'm still not entirely comfortable with this.
This incentivises private citizens to play amateur investigators, potentially putting them in harm's way.
Also, linking the conviction to the proof may not be possible at all. The evidence or details of the case may not be available to the public.
Moreover, "if we agree" seems like a completely opaque and arbitrary process.
To finish, what happens to the bitcoin that are in limbo? Are they "donated"?

Yeah, but that won't solve the problem of it being more rewarding to scam people rather than be good at an honest craft that takes decades to perfect.

This is a completely unnecessary and rash decision, considering the fork was decided AGAINST. Nothing is happening that is threatening NXT. This is an overreaction.
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:22:07
Will they really make more money when a collateral of their action is the Bitcoin price plummeting? But, for the sake of the argument, let's say the miners are rewarded with trucks filled with bars of gold, and do not have to care anymore about the price of Bitcoin.
So you've used Proof of Work for your own agenda and managed to convince miners to help you out with your fork. Good job. But your work is not over yet. In fact, the hardest part is yet to come.
You still have to pass Proof of Consensus.
If Proof of Work is the process of validation of blocks, Proof of Consensus is the informal process of validation of the blockchain by the individual actors in the system.
As soon as the Bitcoin community realise what you're doing (and a rogue mining pool remining old blocks will be discovered very quickly), a likely strategy will be to distribute a custom client which ignores the incriminated block and creates its own fork (see the recent NXT drama, where the devs suggested such a course of action). Honest actors, no matter their hashing rate, will want to hop onto the cleansed blockchain and keep doing their business there. It doesn't matter that your dishonest fork is being worked on by many more miners, clients are still free to ignore it.
However, such a process does rely on how fast actors can be in noticing the fork is happening and jumping onto a sane fork. The more time passes, the more honest transactions are mixed in with the dishonest blocks, and the bigger impact it has on the "real world".
This might end in a game of whack a mole where miners join the new patched blockchain and the whole process starts over again, but the game will resolve itself at some point, and it will likely not be in favour of the miners or fork initiators. They will have a network of millions of people and stakeholders out for their blood. The rogue miners, who are concentrated in centralised mining pools, will be sitting ducks.
Also, if the miners insist on mining on the dishonest fork, the difficulty will go down drastically on the honest fork, which at some point will mean it's much more profitable to hop onto the sane one and resume their work there.
You are right in the sense that such an attack is possible, but you have to rely on a lot of actors (miners and regular users alike) to make a lot of irrational decisions in a row. Irrational actors and actions do happen much more than what we would like to rely on and you never know, but such a scenario does seem far fetched.
At the end of the day, this is yet another form of a 51%. It's impossible to prevent this: you can not stop people from choosing to point their clients to another blockchain. This is actually the whole reason why the blockchain works: the narrative is determined by a decentralised, distributed process of consensus.
You do expose a weakness of PoW: too much power is concentrated in computational power. Other algorithms, such as PoS, offer interesting alternatives in that regard.
Thankfully, you can not stop people from debating which blockchain to join and debate with others where their economical interest lies in. This Proof of Consensus is common to all coins, in that it is based on people voting with their clients and pointing them to the fork of their choice.

Your metaphor is completely wrong. The parallel is absolutely unfit.
For starter, nobody is using public funds to bail out BTER. Secondly, this is a democratic decision constituted of the distributed consensus of people that voted to reverse this transaction. People have a choice to let the guy keep his coins and get to live out on it by still using the old wallet.
It's completely different stakes and outcomes than the financial crisis. It's absolutely the reverse. This is a constructive outcome derived from the democratic process, not people sitting in offices deciding on the fate of the world.
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:37:36
Sorry if I couldn't be much more precise. Smart Contracts are a pretty new field and a lot is still being figured out as to how exactly those should be implemented. I can tell you that some systems provide you with a cryptographically secure certainty that they will be executed because they run on some sort of trustless Turing complete blockchain (Ethereum, SafeCoin, ...), while others will have to rely on a centralised party to execute the logic of the contracts.

Satoshi invented a way to transfer value quickly, and you are complaining people are using it to raise funds for their projects... Makes sense...
Why don't you go on Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and start bitching about how everyone is asking for funds?
Besides, the 1000BTC were not acquired for "promise and beta concept", they were acquired through selling coins to trade and use on the Storj network. You're actually getting something out of it, such as storage on MetaDisk. Unless you've looked at the white paper, the design documents, you've talked to the devs, and you've come to the conclusion Storj won't work? 
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:17:21
Darkwallet is not getting funded because of two reasons:
The marketing is not as good. It's up for them to articulate their message in a clear and compelling way to raise funds effectively. Say what you want about Ethereum, but they delivered in that aspect.
Also, I think people just aren't that interested in completely untraceable and secret blockchains. I would say that most of them realise how much of a double edged sword that concept is, and are happy with the pseudo anonymity that Bitcoin provides.
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:17:25
By its nature, Bitcoin attracts a lot of weirdoes and nutjobs.

No. The "powers that be" will never let it happen. Users preferring a dark blockchain will move to other coins, but I think most people are happy with the pseudo anonymity offered by a cleartext blockchain, and the possibilities it affords its users: accountability, traceability, and transparency.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:55:45
That's a great point that I had completely missed. I guess it's that the longer it takes for you to join the network you want to be on * the importance and number of transactions you make on the network before you do = the less agency you have on your transactions and basically how fucked you are the more real world stuff there is that is based on those transactions.

@_date: 2014-08-12 01:17:25
You can NOT say a 51% is a form of counterfeiting at all. The most you can do in such a case is prioritise or forbid certain transactions from confirming. End of the story. No forgery or imitation of anything, ever. It's not counterfeiting, plain and simple.


What are you talking about? There are people in China that could be making bank on what must have been a sizeable investment, but that are instead sitting on their miners, keeping them turned off for some obscure reasons? That makes no sense at all.
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:26:04
That's the whole genius of having it run on a finite resource. You have to feed the machine credit if you want it to keep computing. This is how infinite loops and crashes are resolved: by making it so that if you put 1 Ethereum or Safecoin worth in the coin slot, you will only get 1 coin worth of computation. You can't just run a while loop and have everything explode.
Sure, there will be buffer overloads and ways to mess with the compiler, but hey, these projects are open source. Come check them out and help debug them.

Imagine a journal that logged every transaction happening on the planet in real time. Every unit is accounted for from its creation to every account it travels through. Every new entry is secured by [SHA 256]( Good luck cracking that, by the way. This is the short story of why you can not misrepresent your funds or give the illusion that you have more than you ever received. There's really no point in discussing this further before you really dive into the blueprint of this technology. Anything else is dogma and repeating a mantra that fails to account for all scenarios.

I wouldn't call it a sign of insolvency. Remember that fiat money travels slower than crypto, which means sometimes transactions just take time and there is a lag that bitcoin perceives because it is happening on a faster clock.

Inflation and deflation both offer challenges and advantages.

Great video that dispels many myths and much agitation around Bitcoin. However, I didn't agree with the parallel made with the OWS/99% movement. While I can see what you're trying to get at, and without trying to debate its merits or faults, they follow different dynamics and answer to different forces. One is political involvement by individuals, and the other is business development. It will be interesting to see where and how the two meet, however.

Yeah, the blockchain is not really tolerant of discrepancies like that. Once the majority moves on, you're left on your own. That's kind of what's brilliant about it: operators who are believed to be malicious or inflicting damage on the moral and practical integrity of the blockchain are excluded from the community. What are you going to be able to do with your millions of NXT you stole? Pass them around your friends? Their value is that of grains of sand. Nothing. For most people, they were never even stolen.
@_date: 2014-08-18 08:52:57
To be fair, you'd have to make the assumption you have the skills and resources to securely and effectively store it yourself.
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:17:38
Then develop a coin whose blockchain is unique and indivisible.
This is actually impossible. What's happening here is that a portion of the clients will just accept to use a different set of data to operate on. You can not prevent people from just pointing their clients to another blockchain.
The fungibility is being respected. What's happening here is that the clients in a network are choosing to ignore a transaction, not the units of currency.
Actually, this whole discussion is a false dilemma.
The kicker here is that you absolutely have the right to keep using the old client and work with the blockchain where the theft happened. Other users choosing to live in a world where the theft "didn't happen" have the right to make that decision, just as you have the right to defend the right of the thief to keep that money.
If you find yourself operating in an older blockchain where users on the newer one can not send you funds or receive funds from you because you decided you'd rather have the thief keep the loot, then it's your problem.
A currency has exactly the same rights any tool has: the capacity for its owners to modify it if they want to operate any changes or updates to its structure. If we want to turn that pen into a plane, what's the pen to complain about?

If that were true, then the mafia would not exist.
Fine, a company whose business model is to sell goods online will not fund an army capable of raiding the world.
However, what if I sell Amazon and fund my army with it? I could form a pretty decent initial force. Then, it would be "business as usual" - manage my profits from my plundering and keep reinvesting in more manpower and weapons. I mean, who's to stop me? There's no police force and army.
Your rant against the state is identical to the rants people direct at the capital, religion, atheists, the list is endless. You focus on one concept and see it everywhere. Guess what, things are more complicated.


Before the European Union, countries were competing against each other in a free market of sorts, acting as individual agents looking out for their best interest. That gave us, oh, peace and, uh, cooperation. A strong European Union was formed expressedly to unite the countries under a common legal framework. That gave the continent the first 50 years of relative peace in history.

THANK YOU for bringing some history into the discussion. People rely far too much on ideology and rhetorics, and some hard facts are always refreshing and welcomed.
There's a similar thing going on with agrarian reform in France during the downfall of the monarchy and the liberalisation of the economy. Famines started appearing because the price of wheat, which had been carefully controlled in the past centuries, started going up and down thanks to speculators, and people started doing things such as hoarding food to make demand go up and make more money from it.
The reality is that the monarchies of old were pretty damn efficient at managing the economy, and the free market was a can of worms that both allowed greater technological development and greater social inequality.

If the blockchain system can not prevent this from happening, then it was never designed or intended to. Go create your own alt coin where that's not possible, and then you can see how things work out for yourself. By the way, this is not actually possible.
You can not stop people from deciding to agree on a new set of rules to play the game they are engaged in. In practice, two currencies are created: one used by people who let the thief go, and one by people who stopped him. Everybody stays on their network and keep transacting with their peers. In a way, this is like a choose-your-own adventure game, you're just not able to interact with people who think differently than you.

There are ways to mitigate this issue but yes, forks are messy. I've been trying to imagine how to implement some sort of fork-tolerant blockchain/client, where some people can choose to deny a transaction, but still continue to operate and transact with addresses that didn't act on it, of course up until the point where the incriminated funds enter their "bubble".

You don't need to wait for a confirmation to see the transaction appear on the blockchain, which is pretty much instant.
When mining is no longer profitable, people will stop mining, which will make the difficulty go down, which will make mining profitable again, and so on and so forth.
The network can scale fine. Did you have any concerns in particular in relation to this?

This number will increase as Bitcoin's value increases. If Bitcoin was a major world currency, and worth 1 million, we'd see $150 MILLION wasted an hour.
No. You have it backwards. The amount of resources spent to mine Bitcoin is equal to the investment in the mining hardware, real estate, manpower, and electricity used. It's a floating amount that depends on the specific case. For now, 90,000$ worth of Bitcoin are CREATED every hour. This amount will change as the price for Bitcoin changes over time.

Why would I agree to disagree here? That would be intellectually debasing, because you are not advancing formal arguments that address the substance of the matter, but just spouting off disjointed stereotyped nonsense. This is not ad hominem, it's ad cogitatio. 
Perhaps you misunderstood me. I asked for examples where government had a positive effect in a market, and you gave me an example where it didn't. Sarcasm aside, maybe that shows you are not really willing to address the point.


I love how you felt too lazy or perhaps emotionally repelled to spell out the word "government" in full, but still found the strength to underline how strongly you felt about your argument with a brilliant addition of a rarely used superlative.
Are you seriously that unwilling to even admit that, at least once in the human history of political economy, more government regulation resulted in a net gain for the economy and general social wellbeing? Sounds like a child stomping his feet, trying to avoid taking the medicine. Take your blinders off, and perhaps start taking a genuine and non-partisan interest in history and (to stay on topic) monetary policy. [Here is a great start.](
I never said anything against free market principles, I was referring to entirely free markets, which I classified in the set of utopia/dystopia. Maybe your libertarian hard-on made you skip over the word "entirely"?
Your confused straw man arguments indicate you are reasoning emotionally, and are merely advancing arguments to support your attitude. You never addressed my question - if, according to you, free market has never been tried, wouldn't that indicate trying it is not really possible? Or perhaps there is a millennial conspiracy going on to prevent true-hearted liberty freedom heroes like you from attaining their perfect idea of society?
Oh, and it seems you are assuming "we" share the same view of what "we" have now as a system. Perhaps you are assuming we are from the same place?
In this case, let me assume in turn that you are from North America. That wouldn't wholly surprise me, as your mental rigidity typically coincides with USA ethnocentrism. It is not only not the center of the world, but also not where I am from myself. Believe it or not.
In case you were suggesting that your observation about "what we have" applies to the entire planet, let me remind you that a lot of countries in the world are actually doing quite well, a number of them taking inspiration from highly structured and controlled economies, as well as of course others exercising their economy at a more liberal pace - it would be plain silly to deny that.
You sound like a fanatic, romanticising modes of production. We get it, you personally identify with the "free market" label and will defend it to the last breath. That's dumb. We're talking about modes of production, not your honour or pride or sense of worth. Relax.

App coins are just starting to appear on the horizon, and already a lot of questions are being raised about the survival of the traditional server architecture. The first app coin was Bitcoin: the decentralised money. Now get decentralised computing, carsharing, networking, banking, storage, marketplaces, etc..

I just don't see Bitcoin going 10X in a few weeks like it used to anymore. There are just too many people who will be selling to realise a profit. The resistance to wide jumps in the price is higher, as there are more people ready to react to such changes.
I think the money is now in app coins. Much smaller market caps, much more prone to volatility and with greater potential for growth. Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin is still a great investment, but it won't be generating any more crazy money.

Stop this. You could not recompute the transactions that have already been confirmed to say something you want them to say without breaking SHA 256 in the process. Good luck with that. You simply do not know what you are talking about. Stop making provably false statements. Seriously. Inform yourself. This is why Bitcoin is so over criticised. People simply don't know how it works.
Yeah, the 51% thing is a problem, nobody said the technology was perfect. However, as soon as we identified who was performing the attack (pretty easy: look at who owns 51% of the network), we would fork our own version of the blockchain and instruct honest nodes to exclude rogue nodes from reporting new blocks to the blockchain. Problem solved. That is one of the answers to this attack, and there are many more plans to weigh should such a scenario ever present itself.
These are facts and if you are going to answer, please only do so after having attentively looked at the technology behind these concepts. It's exhausting to have to clear up misconceptions from people that don't even care enough to inform themselves about a topic before they try debating it.

Note that this has profound implications on the "morality" of the economy. You can choose to prevent coins that you have touched from ever falling into accounts you have banned (Or could you? To be verified). This also implements morality in finance, such as (for instance) Jewish vs Islamic/Catholic rules about usury and debt.
This also solves the problem of a 51% attack, since there is no main ledger to steer in any particular direction, and all nodes have the power and choice to broadcast and process the transactions they prefer. Communities based around a particular association of microforks that have fallen out of favour will move slower, have access to less of the economy, fall intro segregation and eventually stop updating and freeze. It's evolutionary economics.
This could even conceivably be implemented as a layer/goggle to look at a particular blockchain through, though that you wouldn't be able to write to the blockchain, only read from it and make your assessment. Perhaps some metadata could be appended to micro transactions to colour coins to have something a bit more persisting living on the blockchain, but it would remain a purely opt-in basis. If you're the bad guy, you probably won't install this blacklist, and you will never have to care about your coins not being fungible.
This also solves the blockchain size problem, because the only parts of it that you have to worry about are the ones you agree to. If you want to be able to interact with a specific subset you had closed yourself to, you would just have to add that metabranch of the blockchain to your working dataset (possibly having to start a new address, but that's another problem). The complete blockchain could still be of N size, but perhaps you could still have a full copy of the blockchain, just distributed across actors engaged in different subsets of it. No one would have a full copy, but one would exist across the whole network, kind of how you can download a torrent to completion from 10 peers who only own 10% of the file each.
But yes, this is conceptually difficult to define and compute. You'd have to somehow implement ambiguity and selection in a distributed system.

That's great, because double spending is not making a transaction that you intend to replace. It's making two transactions, knowing only one can ever reach its destination. Exactly like writing two cheques for the same amount to two different people, knowing your account can only fund one. Exactly like bouncing a cheque.

I think the appeal of being able to store a full copy of the node on your client is enough argument to try to cut down on the size of the blockchain. I mean, if we can do it more efficiently, why not? Plus, it would be lead to less centralisation of the existence of the blockchain.


Sure, that's a possible way forward. Still, this is not happening today. There is no such system in place to handle micro transactions. We still need a solution to be implemented.

What's the point of mining your block if I'm not going to be able to use the bounty?
Miners will have an incentive to keep building the honest blockchain because that's where you sent them the bounty. When you reward the miner, he will want the next block to be mined on the honest blockchain, so that transaction can be confirmed.

What do you think of software-to-software transactions in terms of frequency and volume? Aren't those liable to explode at some point?
Think of the number of automated micro businesses that could make use of thousands of transactions per hour.

Let's not turn this into a jackdaws vs crows thing, I will just say that double spending does not constitute counterfeiting in spirit. Although this is still a loose comparison, double spending would be much more like writing a check, and then withdrawing money from your account before it clears, making the recipient think they were going to get something (you even showed them how much money you had in your account!).
That does not cover the usually understood definition of counterfeiting, as your check was legit and you had enough money in your account to be able to initiate the transaction in the first place. It's just that you decided to pull the rug from under your funds so they could never reach the destination. No imitation of money ever took place, you just faked them into believing you were sending them those funds.
The extent of vulnerabilities in Bitcoin is a field of study that has not provided anything major so far. There have been thousands of highly skilled hackers trying to crack the world's largest computing network and currency and it seems to have held up fine so far.

@_date: 2014-08-28 18:47:00
That's also because transactions are still too expensive.
The promise of crypto currencies is to have programmable money that can be handled in an automated way by programs.
By making transaction fees 1 satoshi each, you make them cheap enough for all kinds of use cases based on these micro transactions.
This would make transaction volume skyrocket, and those 150 million would be reached quickly. It wouldn't just be people or institutions transacting: but also programs, robots, all kinds of automated machinery or software that take advantage of high volumes of transactions to function.
We need virtually free transactions.

Be careful. If you sign it, you will be proving that address belongs to you, and somebody might be able to figure out how many bitcoins you own by tracking the transactions up the blockchain. You may not want to let people know that if it's a big amount, as that may make you the target of countless attempts of hacking by a lot of very determined, skilled, and focused individuals. The Internet is a wild west, and dealing with Internet money can be a liability in that sense.

If you are doing that, then those 9,999 bills were already being used to avoid taxes and launder money. I never claimed Bitcoin solved tax evasion and money laundering. It offers certain advantages for those, but that's because it is a much more efficient vehicle for money. You can't throw the whole concept away because of fear it will be used for evil. The invention is here and lots of people are using it. Even more will be using it tomorrow. It's over. Yes, there are new challenges when it comes to tax evasion and money laundering. The blockchain actually helps us by being perfectly traceable, helping us track where all funds go - something you can not do with bills, which makes paper fiat in that regard a superior choice for money laundering and tax evasion.

As for libertarianism in itself, it's hard to say since there is a wide variety of people rallying to that label, but a line has to be drawn somewhere when it comes to certain things, and I'm afraid the extreme laissez-faire attitude has a tendency to corrupt quality of life by letting it be gnawed at the edges more and more.

If you cared enough to actually study the technology behind the blockchain, you would learn that it is indeed actually impossible to crack the system. It's a fact.

I think the free market tends to amplify the impact of scarcity on the world, and create abundance of the wrong things.
The French monarchies (for example) had an excellent agrarian management, and famines were the least frequent throughout all of the Middle Ages. The punishments were notoriously draconian, and prison sentences were regularly handed out to people who tried to do things such as attempting to manipulate the price of wheat in order to maximise their profit. There was a verifiable optimal price that was set and locked in, at which both demand and offer were appropriately matched, and silos were kept full through taxation, ready to face any thin crops. That all changed when liberalisation arrived, opening up the market to speculators.
During the Great Depression, farmers burnt their crops in concert because they were forced to create scarcity in order to make their wares valuable enough not to go bankrupt. Meanwhile, people were starving out in the street. Do you see how the order of things is inverted compared to the time of kings ruling with an iron hand? Such behaviour would have been punished by prison, or maybe even death. And rightfully so.
If the government had been strong enough, it would have cracked that free market in half and simply regulated food into people's mouths, saving countless people from misery and death.
The basic ethologic intelligence of putting food in a mouth was defeated by the so-called free market. That can not happen in a regulated environment. So sure, have your free markets and your centres of economic and technological innovation and so on. But not everything should be up for sale.

It's a false dilemma, really. People that don't want to switch over to the new blockchain really don't have to. They can keep transacting on the old one. They just won't be able to communicate with the people that have decided not let a hacker run away with 5% of the coin supply. Their loss. This is a brilliant development and has exciting implications for the security of crypto-currencies. Participants can protect the network against non-cryptographical attacks.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:00:30
It is democratic because you can choose to keep the old client and live in the world where the rollback didn't happen and the thief gets to keep his coins.
If you want him not to, you update to the new version and avoid the liability of him running around with 5% of the money supply he stole from thousands of people.
If then you can't transact with some people because they decided to live in a world where they punished the guy, when you decided to live in a world where you let him get away with it, then that's your problem.
This is how forking works and it's a brilliant outcome. It makes people able to choose their own blockchain and live in their own world.

That's simply ridiculous, and if this is what informs your way thinking about society, you ought to start practicing more empathy, my friend. I love how you even formulated as some sort of scientifically certainty, as if that could be quantified like that. Come on. Here's a hint, if you think 98% of people are inherently bad, then you are the problem, not 98% of people.
I give control over part of my life to people so they can protect me from others. That's what the legal system is. Would you rather live in a world where justice is performed by vigilantes or even just you and your friends? Hang on a second, doesn't that sound like some basic form of law enforcement and government, where rules are enforced by a group of people with a self-appointed moral authority? Something like despotism, perhaps? Or, perhaps, securing the territory should be performed by paramilitary squads that compete each other for how powerful and dominant they are over each other so you will feel compelled to pick them? Are you serious?
The government provides us a way to fulfil those needs outside of the free market of money by voting for who should perform that. Yes, it's not perfect, yes it can be gamed, but then you have to look at what's not working and fix that, not throw everything away.
You know what's a good example of anarchy? The world. The world is in a natural, constant state of pure anarchy, and humans have created structures to protect themselves from that. What you are arguing, is that if we removed those structures, then the world would self regulate itself like a market and we would return to some primal state of grace and cooperation. That's a fairy tale, like the free hand of the market fulfilling everybody's needs and desires. The primal state of grace and cooperation doesn't exist. It's an all-out race for the self. Look at the animal world. Human beings transcended it through empathy and cooperation, creating structures that have carried us through millennia of social evolution. I'm talking about governments of all kinds. Monarchies, democracies, republics, dictatorships, social democracies, and so on. You could even say that it's one of the things that makes humans humans. All of these have one thing in common: delegating authority to somebody else. What about the time when you relied on your parents to provide for you? Weren't you delegating authority then, thus establishing some basic primal form of governance? A lot of times, that went wrong. But that would be like focusing on planes crashing. What about all the times a plane doesn't crash and does just what it's supposed to do?
Yes, positions of power attract assholes that want to take advantage of that. Reducing all government to that is ridiculous. It's like saying we should ban guns, because weirdoes and terrorists might use them. Or we should ban Bitcoin because it will be used by the same kind of people. The government is a platform used by people with competing and different interests. Just like guns are a tool used by people with competing and different interests. I don't even have to explain this.
Actually, I don't know where in the world you live, but the government where I live is actually doing a pretty damn good job at health care, paving roads, and other such services. Yes, I am convinced of it, and you would need to really argue your case as to why they actually repressed human evolution so drastically. Your argument then can only be, as far as I am concerned, that those things could be done more efficiently by a free market. Why would I take a leap of faith and try to tear down a proven infrastructure just to try to build a system relying on faith and ideology? I often hear the argument that a truely free market has never existed. Doesn't that kind of tell you that such a thing is impossible, just like a perfect socialist state?
Even disregarding that, I believe some things MUST be constructed outside of the free market of money. This is not some ideological dogma, it's based on the observation of the real world. The free market has shown to be a race to the bottom in many cases, where the end goal of providing a service or product ends up taking the back seat as making profits becomes the only important thing. 
The "roads" thing is a trope, which serves to talk about ALL the things the government does and convey this concept in a form that everybody can relate to and understand. When people talk about roads, they talk about all services provided by the government. Yeah, it has become sort of a cliche, and there's a couple good joke you can crack, but don't reduce the issue to roads. The people talking about them don't. I'll take the first one to talk about: roads would need to be built around some form of consensus, fundraising, delegation of work and responsibilities and so on. How does not that call for some sort of government?
Regardless. You need to get that chip off your shoulder to understand why 98% of people are not bad or apathetic and why their consistently organising around a form of government for, oh, the past millennia is not the mark of their damnation. How about, both liberal and centralised approaches offer a wide range of challenges and opportunities, which should be managed according the best possible outcome prediction? How about, the free market and managed economy are two modes of production, each with its set of opportunities and challenges, each a different strategy best fit for different contexts?

Guess what, the lying, killing/jailing people, and making things unpleasant is something people do. People like you obsess over one thing and think it is the root of all evil. Some people say it's religion, some people say it's atheism, some people say it's the capital, some people say it's the government, some people say it's jews. The reality is that there are people good and bad in any institution, and good and bad things result from that. In case you forgot, this organisation you are so afraid of also has a long track record of paving roads, providing health care, social security, schools, firefighters, etc... You can not reduce it to any one of these elements.

Obviously when a holder spends he is not strictly an holder anymore. There's obviously a difference between holding money that you do not expect to go up in value and money that you expect to go up in value. I don't want to go through all the deflationary thing again, I'm just saying it has lots of different kinds of impact.


I never said that, stop thinking in "good" or "bad" terms, the market price going up or down is not itself "good" or "bad" anyway.


I guess what completely explodes this line is payment gateway systems (Ripple, Stellar, etc...) that automatically convert crypto as it passes the system. This way, even if you are holding Ethereum or StorjCoin or whatever else, you can send it to a Bitcoin address in an easy and secure way, just as if you were holding Bitcoin in the first place. The network effect is multiplied not only by the participants on one network, but by the number of different networks you can reach. Boom. No more division line between anything.
To me that's real progress and only strengthens the crypto ecosystem.


That's simply not the case and a simple glance at the alt/app coin ecosystem will show you why. Can you store files over the Bitcoin network? What are you going to do? Break up your file over a bunch of OP_RETURN commands? Forget it. It's not going to happen.
Take [this "distributed dropbox" design for instance]( Are the Bitcoin core devs going to implement this design? How? On what timeline? What other priorities do they have? What impact would implementing a storage system on top of a payment network have? That sounds just a bit silly. Go on the Bitcoin development community forums and ask them what they think about making Bitcoin a turing complete blockchain. See what they tell you.
Thankfully, they don't need to do it, because other blockchains are being built around this very service.
Think of Linux. How many distros are there? How many options? How many use cases? How many designs? It's the example of a vibrant ecosystem.
You can't expect Bitcoin to do absolutely everything, like you don't use one single model of cars, computers, shoes, whatever it is. Different brands, different models, different applications.

If he doesn't think he is mining at a loss, he will keep mining.

What if he keeps mining and Bitcoin booms in one week? He may make much more money than the cost of shutting down the mining operation, selling the equipment, shipping it around, etc...
That's just a black and white example but you can make up a lot of these kind of scenarios.

I guess Coinbase has removed that option so Joe doesn't fat finger something and accidentally sell all his fortune for peanuts.

I'm not at all an "Apple hater" and I've used their products extensively and with great pleasure (starting years ago with a black and white Macintosh Classic II).
My point was in relation to the notion that if people complain enough, they'll allow crypto currencies in Apple Pay. I think it's unlikely, considering they would piss off a lot of megacorp banks in the process. Crypto wallet apps are allowed, and it might be as far as they go.
@_date: 2014-08-29 23:58:30
I'm saying. If I am a merchant looking to adopt Bitcoin, and see that the number of transactions per second on the network is lower than X, I would be less enclined to start accepting it than if I saw more than X transactions per second happening on the network.
It may be that overall, saving/hoarding Bitcoin has also positive effects, but you can't say it's ONLY positive for Bitcoin adoption, that makes no sense, nothing works like that in real life. Forget about trying to get a perfect game theory model for a second.
Also, Bitcoin IS an app coin. It just happens to be the first example of it. If they want to argue it has no monetary value, fine, but there is not some magical division line between Bitcoin and all the other alt/app coins around it.
Take for example Storj, their coin is backed by the storage capacity it affords you on the network, it is much sounder money than Bitcoin in that regard, which is only backed by its capacity to store value. If anything, this is similar to the difference between Gold and Paper: Gold at least gives you many options, whereas Paper has less intrinsic value, and is only scrap paper if it's not used as money. Same goes for Storj and Bitcoin.
I am not saying that Bitcoin will not prevail as the dominant money coin for years to come, I think there is a very high chance it will, but from what I've gathered, the guys over at Nakamoto Institute sound a lot like they have a vested interest in the Bitcoin price going up, at the detriment of all the interesting and exciting things happening in the crypto world.

It's amazing how the technology pioneers of yesterday so eagerly become the new monopolistic dinosaurs of today. Bitcoin was literally invented yesterday, and there are already people doing everything they can to establish a monopoly because it serves their interest. It does not make any sense that in a free market, you would have only one offering. It's like saying there should will only be one brand of car, or one electricity company. That might even be true at first, but soon people start catching up on the idea and the market opens up. In fact, you are fighting yesterday's fight. People are transacting in other currencies than Bitcoin, and this is happening today. There is nothing you can do against this. It's a simple fact that will not go away, no matter how hostile you are to innovation and competition in this space.

So true. You have to keep in mind that many people on here do not really have an interest in Bitcoin, they just gather around the drama and feel like they have to pick a side and participate in the controversy.
People will still be raging at Bitcoin and crypto in 5, 10, 20 years. Whole schools of thoughts and economics will be formed in support or in detraction of the principles and the technology behind Bitcoin and crypto-currencies.
So much vitriol and ostracism from both sides makes it look like it's turning into sort of one of those black/white phenomenons: Are you for or against Anonymous? Wikileaks? Statist or Anarchist? Occupy Wall Street? Left or Right? Obama? Israel or Palestine? What about Bitcoin?
Ultimately, as always, those are false dilemmas that do not really inform you on what exactly is at stake. However, once you have a polarisation going on, it's hard to escape it.
The whole vs drama is stupid. I feel like both places are similar, in that you first have the big bulk of posture, rhetorics, and bandwagonism, then a long tail of actual reasonable arguments that actually give you an opportunity to learn something useful or constructive.

About the "JP Morgan guy". You are taking another person's words to illustrate your point. What you are saying just does not make any bloody sense. Robert Shiller and the "JP Morgan guy" are not the same person. Robert Shiller is not responsible for what the "JP Morgan guy" says.
I am not believing anybody just because he has triple the lifetime experience, but I am not dismissing anybody simply because he is "old" either - which is what you do. I have not heard one material argument or counterargument from your part, just opinions camouflaged as certitude.
I will, however, take any "old elitist" Nobel laureate over anything produced by the echo feedback chamber of a bunch of people with an embedded conflict of interest in their own mind - if they own bit coins, then bitcoin must be proved successful, lest they be proved wrong and lose a bunch of money in the process.
As a side note, I own Bitcoins myself and am fairly positive about its future. But I will not dismiss negative predictions about my investment because of idiotic attitudes such as yours. Fuck you. Go back to school.

I absolutely agree with you. However, when we get to attend to everybody's basic food/shelter/health needs easily and cheaply, we can stop it with this obsession about having to "get a job" and let people live their lives in a non technically "productive" way if they want. The market should support these pursuits, and I don't think making it entirely free will do the job. If I want to live in harmony with my techno-natural environment, live off what my auto-farming crop and play guitar in my 3D-printed eco-forest resort, can I please do that? Not in a free market, because I will technically be only a consumer, and not a producer. Give me my daily 1000 satoshi allowance and leave me alone. Thanks. If I want or need more money, I will find it fair to have to find more productive activities and enter the free market. But let me stay out of it as well.

That is indeed one of the advantages offered by a "cleartext" blockchain, and truely anonymous cryptos lack the accountability that Bitcoin offers.
Nobody would use a crypto with identifiable and public addresses, because that would be too dangerous for financial privacy. Knowing how much somebody owns or who owns a given address is just too dangerous.

This would be a case of the majority of stakeholers deciding in a decentralised, democratic way to ignore a transaction on the blockchain, while not affecting any other event that has happened so far. This simultaneously solves the issues with transaction irreversibility while respecting its fundamental concept, by putting the responsibility of executing a "chargeback" not on a single party, but on the distributed consensus of the network. It's a brilliant outcome and opens exciting new prospects for PoS.

But, but, people don't behave in purely economically rational ways, even if only because what is economically rational is debatable. It is not an exact science. You are proposing to take a leap of faith and make the whole system rely on the assumption that a private company will always behave rationally (based on an entirely subjective statement of what is rational and what isn't). What if the owner of that company does not agree with you and goes on and invest in aggression in order to provide better services and lower prices to its customers? Does that fit in your carefully thought out plan?

The precedent has already been set. Other coins have faced similar choices. Some have managed to proceed smoothly, and others have crashed due to that.
The same scenario will present itself many times, and every time, the result will be different.
If the blockchain is not designed to prevent this, then this can not be prevented.
It's a fake dilemma. Choose to use the blockchain where the thief got away, or choose to use the blockchain where you stopped him. It's up to you. You just won't be able to transact with people who have chosen differently, but isn't that just forcing you to be coherent with your choices?

You could even do the store logic in Ethereum and plug into Storj for your storage needs. You could forget about Storj and just reimplement it into Ethereum. You could do the whole thing on Maidsafe. The only reservation I had about Storj was that it seems to me they are aiming at doing a pure storage service, not so much a store/merchant system. The advantage of Turing-complete systems such as Ethereum or Maidsafe would be that you could do everything on the one solution. But I could be wrong and this sort of stuff could be semi-trivial to implement on Storj.
There's really a dozen ways you could do this, imagination and resources are the limit.
Keep in mind that the teams behind Ethereum, Storj, and others are all on great terms and talking with each other behind the scenes to set up a conversation and standards in the industry.

All symptoms of a competitive economy based on scarcity.

It's not a bailout. There is no use of public funds to bail out a private party. In fact, your inappropriate use of the word bailout makes you look like a rabid anarchist, clamouring for blood at the idea of an intervention in the market. Guess what, if the market decides to roll the transactions back, that's a perfect example of anarchy in action. No centralised decision to either move on or fork, but the subjective action of individuals acting on the world. Anyway.
 It's a worthwhile use of the technology of the blockchain. Yeah, that's sort of a pandora box as to what happens to all the real world transactions that happened after that. But these kind of things are bound to only get more and more controversial and dangerous as time goes on, and NXT is still small enough to navigate that safely.

Bitcoin, by its nature, is not backed by anything. That is, you can not exchange it at some sort of rate for something else. There is no institution that offers such a service.
On the other hand, there are some projects that are promising to deliver such kind of crypto-currencies. Ethereum, for example, says their coin will be backed by the processing power it will be able to buy on their network. Storj says their coin will buy you storage space, and so on.
This is a return to the concept of "sound money" that was abandoned in the previous century by governments, so they could print money without worrying about having to back it with gold.

Oh, don't get me wrong. It could very well go pear shaped and there might be some bubble dynamic going on, or at least some overvaluation that will show its horns later on. However, it also shows there is pronounced interest in the technology, and it might convert into widespread demand and adoption when the software goes live. I guess time will tell. I wouldn't however qualify it as a "scheme". There is no ponzi or pyramid thing going on, it's real teams with real talent working on real projects, whatever the outcome will be.
I think we will be seeing only more and more of these. The Ethereum/MaidSafe/Storj presales are demonstrating a good publicity campaign can go a long way in securing funds quickly and efficiently. This is when the actual scams or empty shells will start popping up, propped up by people looking to make a quick buck with no real intention or production plan.
I do agree there is a bit of a problem with the Bitcoin sub. A lot of things are lumped in together that shouldn't be. It would be better to be more spread out, but this is the biggest and most popular sub for everything blockchain/crypto related, and it's not likely to change.

I guess it's about the way things are spun. The whole thing was presented as sort of a false dilemma, when in reality, there will just be 2 currencies like you say.
Hop onto the new blockchain and reverse that transaction, or keep using the old one and be stuck with people that do not want to prevent the theft from happening. Both groups can still transact and operate with each other, except for that one dividing line. You can only transact with people that share the same values as you. It's kind of brilliant in a way.

You really need to rethink your end-all, closing argument stance on this. Bitcoin is 5 year old. A lot can happen. How could the transaction unit of, say, Ethereum or Safecoin be close to 0 when that will be the only way to acquire computing credits to spend on the distributed applications running on those networks? Think these things over. It's like you are getting confused between what you wish will happen for you to make the most money based on your current plan and reality. There's VISA, Mastercard and American Express. Many different implementations of the same concept. They exist and compete to fulfill this function. Western Union and Moneygram. Etc. So it will be with money blockchains.
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:27:38


Paper money isn't infinite either. It may be printed in excessive quantities and in an all too liberal way by governments, but there is still some fixed net amount of the total amount of money existing. What they can do is print as much as they want of it, which some people perceive as a disadvantage compared to Bitcoin, which has a finite amount that is mathematically set and cryptographically locked.


The last coin will be mined around the year 2140, and nobody can predict what the price of Bitcoin will be then, let alone if we will still be using it.


There are some decentralised exchange projects going on, but there is not P2P market in the sense you mean. All the exchanges used to convert paper money to crypto currencies are centralised operations.

Not my attempt. I didn't think of the connection, but you do raise a valid observation in between all the ad hominem and hostility. I do think the concept of republic is far more relevant than socialism, but fair enough. Do you have any specific objections to a centralised legal system? Do you believe not only that morals are relative, but that people should enter into conflict over who is more right?

That's because of the goddamn exchange rates. If it's cheaper to perform the same thing in China, it's not because the Chinese are some genius race that have it all figured out, it's because they are manipulating their exchange rate so people are compelled to send their manufacture over there. Also, lower work and environmental standard make manufacture cheaper. Wow, what a great deal - I shall offset my costs and externalise them by not having to keep my workers as safe and not having to be held responsible if a river turns bright red.

Your rhetoric suffocates this conversation. Care to tone it down? You are the one taking out the dictionary.
I show you 50 dollars in my wallet. I promise you to pay you with those. You give me whatever good or service you were selling for those 50 dollars. Then, I put those 50 dollars in another wallet of mine, or give them to somebody else. You have already given me your good, so you are screwed, a bit as if my check bounced. That was a successful double spending attack.
Double spending is neither like imitating a transaction or imitating money. I made a promise I could deliver at the time of making it in both cases - it's just that I could only get the 50 dollar bill to one person. I broke my promise. If I print and give you a fake bill, I deliver on my promise of giving you something you expect has value, it's just that I misrepresented it to you. If I double spend some bitcoin, I never delivered anything to you. These are fundamentally different use cases.

Great argument.
Removing the block size cap would also multiply Bitcoin transactions by making them cost a fraction of what they cost today, which would help making mining fees worth it.

I believe everybody sort of agrees on what is right and wrong. It's that nobody agrees on how to efficiently promote one and repress the other. If you remove yourself from the debate, you censor yourself for no reason, and the only thing you get from it is shooting yourself in the foot and not making your argument progress. You'll always have to deal with other people and other perspectives.

That can never happen since as soon as one actor leaves the network (goes to bed and turns off his computer, which would be dumb since he could be making money simply by leaving it on), a copy of the file is added to another node from the other copies that are still online.
As a side note, since Storj is a global network happening across the whole planet, it's unlikely all of the nodes carrying a copy of your file will go offline at the same time due to time zones.
This is the basic idea of it. Please do give the Storj forums a spin, I have only limited knowledge and can only be so much detailed and thorough in my answers.
For an in-depth look at a similar design, please [check out Ethereum's spin on it]( Please note that the Storj and Ethereum teams are collaborating on some aspects, which means some of the elements you will find in this article are liable to apply to Storj as well.

1 is right. It takes in average 10 minutes for every block to be mined. That's what he was talking about and don't pretend you don't understand. Now, you may argue that the restaurant doesn't need to wait for a block to be mined for them to confirm that the transaction exists on the network, and that's a valid case to argue, but don't say that he's not being fair.
2 is right. It's a fact. Bitcoin is not backed by anything, which means you can not redeem it for anything else. You may argue that fiat money isn't either, and you may be right, but fair is fair: Bitcoin is uncorrelated to other assets than itself.
3 is debatable. Don't just look at the chart, look at the orders of magnitude. It took $9 for Bitcoin to go from $1 to $10. It took $900, 10 times the original amount, to reach $1000 from 100$. The market is moving proportionally more and more every year.
4 is debatable. Both inflationary and deflationary currencies offer their set of advantages and challenges. You may very well argue that deflation is not good for a currency. You may not agree with it, but it's not unfair to state this.

It very well might be. The thing is that Bitcoin has much more room to grow than gold. Only 12 million Bitcoin to go around has mathematical implications in terms of liquidity and the nominal price it can reach, and 5 billion is really a drop in the ocean.
On the other hand, merchants will be putting a lot of downwards pressure by converting to fiat when accepting Bitcoin. Even if a merchant keeps 90% of his revenue in Bitcoin, that 10% going to fiat all the time is a constantly leaking tap. 
I predict 2015 will see Bitcoin evolve but never go beyond $1000.

You're wrong. I know what m-of-n is. xFA is still only diluting the problem. The reality is that you only need a few strings of data to wreak havoc. If your account gets compromised, there's nothing you can do. Think over the course of your lifetime. It will happen at some point. Having no recourse other than trying to say your old account was compromised (and who is going to believe that? how do you prove this to your peers? etc...) makes this a huge damocles sword. There are certain things where you do need some sort of central authority to sort things through if need be. And that can only be understood and performed by the human beings around you. Computers need to serve us, not enslave us to their arbitrary bits of code.

Your name shall be included in the "Thanks to" section of the book i will be writing afterwards.
1 BTC MINIMUM?? If I literally give you up to 500 dollars, you will not go through the effort of giving me the honour of copying and pasting my name in a list of contributors? Alright dude. Maybe I'm just being stingy.


Once i am travelling i will say hello to you in private and make a video with you if possible. Please understand that it might be impossible to come to your region though.
I guess 5000 dollars is the minimum for you to have the courtesy to come say hi in your world travels. Which is what, a round trip in business class with a two night stay in a hotel. Fair enough. We wouldn't want you to catch a cold.


Once my travels will be done I am going to write a book about it. If it ever will be published you will be rewarded with at least 30% of my income generated by it.
What if 4 people donated 50 BTC? How are you going to math that up? And you are really not going to go through the effort of it being published? I mean, you could even self-publish, but you can't even guarantee that. I guess 25,000 dollars can only go so far in your involvement in your own project.


You may follow me with a camera at your own expense and film me 24/7 on my journey to make a documentary out of this. We will then work out a contract to handle the income generated by this and also the copyright issues.
Let me get this straight. I pay you 50,000 dollars, out of my pocket, no questions asked, I haven't even seen your face or know your name, no contract signed, and I get the right to, at my own expenses, produce a documentary of your travels. I will still have to nickel-and-dime you for any revenue because of course you have to look after your own business.
No offense dude, you are asking for too much and giving too little. You are thinking of getting money before even having drawn a travel plan or posted a single proof of concept vlog where you introduce who you are and convince us that this is a worthwhile use of our funds. If you can get us excited, the coins will be flying at you. Can you talk to a camera? Write an article? Work that out before you start asking for donations.

I don't know. I think the public and complete nature of the ledger enables for far more control and oversight than anything before. Any participant, government included, has knowledge of every transaction ever made on the network. That does not bode well for privacy, which is at best a sensation when using Bitcoin. IPs are logged. Exchanges are tracked. If even TOR was successfully deanonymised, what makes you think Bitcoin will resist? Yes, there is space for anonymous accounts and cash-in-hand exchanges, but that is a fringe sphere that will be easier to track in comparison to its paper/fiat equivalent with its invisible transactions and fiscal paradises.
I don't think anybody should be either a statist or an anarchist. I believe in learning from these schools of thought, then setting them aside and advancing a balanced, realistic view based on the observable world and available evidence. In my opinion, a moderate approach is the best fit for this.
The point of the government discouraging from engaging in piracy, online porn, or printing guns. I think there are real, practical, ethical reasons from staying away from those, and it's not just a case of the state trying to ruin your fun. It's not a case of the state cooking up legal fictions just to assert power.
Tax evasion isn't dangerous for you, it's dangerous for society. It's not a myth that if you stop paying taxes, then there is less money to pave roads and pay firefighters. Yeah, that also means less money for drones, but which one do you think they are going to cut first? Let's take gambling. Do you think unlicensed gambling is illegal just because? No, it's illegal because gambling is fraud in the most elementary sense of the word. Same goes for many things. Porn debases your sexual energy and disconnects you from the real sexuality of the normal and the everyday people. Joints are a gamble on your health, why not just make edibles? ps. I love my cookies. ANYWAY.
I don't think crypto currencies are here to fight the state. I think crypto currencies are here to serve creating a new sphere of power and economical activity, and this is precisely what is happening. The states will try to capture it, and will succeed to some extent. The anarchists will go about their business, and they will also succeed to some extent. My prediction is that we will we see a new form of blockchain-based government and citizenship appearing at some point, which will actually take from both the westphalian conception of the state and the cypher punk anarchists.
The problem I see with this your closing argument is that you assume that everybody understands what a free, peaceful, and productive life is in the same way and that everybody has the same plan to get there. It's simply not the case. Both the statists and the anarchists want the same thing, believe it or not.

No really. Counterfeiting bitcoins would need you to make them from scratch and send them to an address on the blockchain. This address could never understand where your counterfeit bitcoins came from or what they mean to the network, since all mining and transacting is done officially and out in the open. Who mined your coins? Where did they come from? It would never make sense for them to exist.
There are possible theoretical attacks on how to make transactions bug out a bit, but it will always be possible to find out about them by rewinding the blockchain and examining every transaction and event. Only the ones that make sense will be accepted by the nodes.

In this case, the software would be the firmware running on the device? I think that would not make much sense. When you order a laptop from overseas, is the price of the OS deducted from the value of goods? A smartphone? A microwave? That does not typically happen.

One way people sometimes use is posting the content to yourself, and not open the letter or package when it arrives so you have a proof of stamp.

The question of which bills to use is still up for grabs though. Bitcoin is a coal factory compared to some of the leaner, faster block chains coming out.

You're just arguing semantics and dialectics. The article makes the point that companies are not really accepting Bitcoin, which is the case in the sense that they are still receiving only fiat in their accounts. That's what the article is talking about. You're just wasting everybody's time by trying to muddy the water arguing about words. Also, it seems to be highly relevant considering that is likely playing a huge part in the downward pressure exerted on Bitcoin.

But the devs are only offering this. People still have to install the update and use the new blockchain.
We can clearly see how people could be upholding the public interest by pursuing their own. There is nothing wrong with this, it's actually a brilliant development of PoS and blockchain technology.
Besides, even if we didn't fork now, this scenario will still happen again and again and again. Not acting now won't fix any problem. That's why it's not a problem and it should't be thought of one, it's a property of the blockchain that can be exploited in extreme circumstances. I find that brilliant.

Since the definition of what rewarding is very contestable, you can only go by the only objective metric that is possible to handle: how much money people make. Of course some people find it more rewarding to volunteer as a health worker in a poor place rather than spend your days in an office scamming people, and that's how it should be.
In a system with less regulation, scamming people would be easier because you can simply get away with it. Who is to stop you on your con rampage? Nobody, even though you are doing harm and anarchism still forbids physical violence (even though it stops at indirect violence, unexplainably).

Imagine you are a programmer.
Imagine you want to integrate some sort of currency/value input/output system in your software.
You have two choices: fiat and crypto.
Fiat: You have to use an expensive and/or tedious API to handle transactions through a third party. Once you send the transactions, there may be lag during entire days between sending and receiving money. You have to deal with bureaucracy, rules, proprietary standards.
Bitcoin/Crypto: It's programmable money you can juggle around with ease. Nobody can stop or act upon that stream. There are no limits on the amount and frequency of your transactions. Everybody uses the same standard, and you can expect the same behaviour across all software and external entities you are interacting with.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:25:36
That's fair. That still doesn't address the concept of a guaranteed, minimal revenue for all that prevents people from starving or sleeping under a bridge.

Wrong. Pegged fiat/crypto coins are stable, which makes them infinitely more attractive than BTC to a lot of people. Some of them rely on the Bitcoin blockchain, which stil enshrines Bitcoin as the data recording and reference database of the world, i.e coloured coins, OP_RETURN stuff. People might just end up stopping using BTC altogether and just use it to trade the coloured coins on the blockchain.

Good point. I don't see fees going down after the block size going up, though. Think of a vending machine : the cost of storage, cooling, automated distribution system, etc... have all gone down in the past decades, but that never verified as the individual retail price of the can of pop lowering. Taxes go up, but they rarely go down. There is always a distinct general inflation of prices, unrelated to the monetary base expanding. Wallet software producers would have to be incentivised to roll back the default fee. Do they really have an interest in doing so? There have been talks of making the fee dynamic through some scripted result drawn from market price and other factors, but no such standard has been set.

in this particular case, you just need to wait for the transaction to be confirmed by waiting a little while (around 10 to 20 minutes), at which point it's set in stone and you are good to go. the warning is in case you would want to trust the transaction before it was included in a block

you sounding all frustrated and high and mighty is not helping your point one bit. anyway, obviously once you have all the infrastructure and everybody ready to go then the transaction is free. but you can say that of anything. once you pay for a coffee, then the actual holding the cup and drinking it is free. wow, what a bargain

Yes but right now Europe needs jobs and revenue not alpaca socks
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:34:08
You don't understand this. This is a good thing. This was done on purpose. This means Europe can export more things because it's cheaper for other countries to buy European products. This is good for the economy. Fucking do the math and think things through instead of mindlessly going ohmahgerd 35% drop euro is dying fuck the police!!11
No you don't always want the value to go down like when it's a marker for sketchy things happening (for example capital getting the fuck out of Russia as of recently), but keeping the value low is exactly what China did for a decade in order to boost demand for Chinese production. 
This is one of the problems with Bitcoin being a global currency : great for international trade but often bad for local economies. Every place on earth doesn't face the same opportunities and challenges and Bitcoin being the great leveller will have unexpected consequences.

Woah, that's a seriously uninformed and prejudicial opinion of Colored coins. Like other smart assets based on the bitcoin blockchain, they let people issue and trade their own tokens with the added security of the bitcoin network.

@_date: 2015-03-21 12:32:04
This is pure madness... So what, we should just ignore where the coins come from, and give thieves their money and bid them farewell? Do you think BTC-e is a rogue exchange? Do you think they don't have to comply with laws? If somebody stole your wallet, wouldn't you be glad somebody used the opportunity they had to return it to you? So, the "dangerous precedent" being set here is common sense and courtesy?

you are stereotyping and simplifying reality in a way that fits your silk road is nice narrative. the reality is that the silk road was one more venue for drugs producers and traders to make profits. you still need bad guys with guns to produce, smuggle, pack, ship. If anything, the silk road created more demand for drugs. where do you think heroin comes from? unicorn shit? silk road did sort of sanitise the link between customer and pusher, but that's it. have you seen how they make cocaine? does it look like they have the interests of the customer in mind? do you think the silk road made more or less profits for the mexican cartels making the connection between south and north america?

Something that could help could be to update the blockchain with some sort of location/ownership/status update whenever something happens to the object you are tracking - you could check for yourself if the history looks suspicious or downright wrong. If the blockchain claimed the object to be somewhere and you are seeing it somewhere else, you know something is up, etc...

THIS. For once, this is the beloved invisible hand of the free market acting for good, but our libertarian friends are having a very hard time accepting this. They have trouble with the notion that anarchy means people don't have to follow arbitrary rules about respecting fungibility made up by the priests of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:38:14
The hilarious thing is that so-called "an-caps" are absolutely fine with coercion as long as it's NOT law enforcement and police doing it. If the gubbamint freezes funds, it's fascism. If BTC-e does it, it's the free market in action. These people are completely disconnected from reality and are just driven by a oedipus complex where they reject any figure of authority but let things slide when actually authoritarian actions are taken by any other than the daddy/gubbamint figure.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:31:53
banks are the devil but there doesn't seem to be any evidence to support the notion that you would get ripped off in the event of a single high value transfer like this one. you would also have some legal and practical recourse in case of shenanigans. bitcoins on the other hand are gone when they're gone. 5 n of m spread across different vaults seems like a pretty good threshold to me.

that would be like saying using your phone at home on your wifi connection lets you go on the internet for free. or, you ate a burger for free because it just happened to be in your hands. no. yes we can only speculate at so what they did to actually secure the money but it's not an entirely separate matter. it's actually the very core of the matter as to how they actually make it secure. they're not going to write down the private key on a piece of paper and put it in their family photo album.
