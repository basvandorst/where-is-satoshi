If you argue mine are incorrect, it's your burden to produce the evidence. Otherwise you're just a mouthpiece..

Sorry to derail the thread but the question is, does TR spread hate and violence by speaking against the hatred filled and violent Islam? I get it that not everyone follows it to the letter but studies show that 40% of muslims want sharia law and some 60% would not turn in a terrorist if they knew one. Some 10% say bombings are fully justified while 40% say it's sometimes justified. Let's face the facts, it's a completely different culture, one we don't fully understand.
In the UK alone, members of the muslim population which accounts for 6% of the total population are responsible for 80% of the rapes. And when it comes to the rapists, most of them are still free to bask in the sun and spend freely from their Paypal wallets because now police can't keep up interviewing the victims.. who are in the thousands, and most underage (or at least they were at the time they were raped).
Members of the same 6% population are responsible for most knife attacks, almost all bomb attacks and now they like to throw acid in people's faces.. and all the police does is advise people to rinse with plenty of water if they were acid attacked.
Someone needs to speak on behalf of the victims.. the police knew about the rape situation for a long time but have turned a blind eye because of political correctness and fear of being branded as racists. They never took action against the grooming gangs before it got into the press thanks to the likes of TR.

There you go.. the mindset of the oppressed, projected onto me. Who said I was oppressed or held down? If I want to see what's holding me down I first look in the mirror ;) so should you and every other decent human being.

I remember the days when you would register for free email and got 50 bitcoins bonus.. I probably have those 200 and even more in wallets long forgotten.
The only thing keeping me alive is that I don't know for certain how much I've lost, otherwise I'd sure be suicidal.

This tells me nothing, police officers (on or off duty) can be jerks too.


Who never got into a fight? All men do eventually.. Tommy was unfortunate to be arrested, most fights end before the police gets there.


Nasty, but without full details it might have been the case that the underage victim posed as being of age, like we see it happening frequently.


Was that when he was banned from speaking at some meeting because he was a "far right extremist"? A shitty move should not be responded with another, true, but he's kind of pushed into illegality just on the account of his views opposing the globalist agenda.


He merely lent his brother or cousin some money, and it was actually the brother/cousin who has lied on the mortgage form. They just wanted him arrested and that was the best they could find.

If mine are off then show me yours and the source please. Otherwise go sing at another table.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:38:46
Sources are all over the internet, search "uk grooming gangs" and tell me how many of the convicted are Pakistani men.. and it's barely scratching the surface, investigation has just started and only 20% of the victims have been interviewed. I've been soft on the number, it's 84% actually.. I guess my memory is not what it used to be.
Now.. where are your numbers, boy?
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:04:32
So switching to a subset of the 6% makes a difference.. interesting. The logic behind them being 84% pakistani men is that one gets a hold of the prey then calls another, and the other calls another and so on. Makes sense they share some common background, like speak a common language, right?
It also makes sense why none of them reported the others or said "no", since they were taught since birth that white girls are filth, dirty meat, infidels etc and that it's ok to do to them as you please cause.. bounty. Is that not how the quran depicts it? As well as lying to promote Islam, as well as honor killings and many other things that our culture is not ready for?
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:48:12


I agree.


The first step is acknowledging there is a problem, but we are not there yet. Tommy works to that end.


Stealing =/= killing and yes, migrant thieves are known to be deported.


Just because the mindset of a nationalist is branded in the media as right wing extremism does not make it equal to "I'm going to bomb that concert" extremism.

Google man, google. Read the Qur'an so you actually know what it's about. They have such thing in Qur'an named Taqiya that allows them to dissimulate and lie as long as it's to promote Islam. Bottom line, don't take them at face value.. I saw the most moderate Muslim grinning at the phone watching the Manchester bombing. So I started reading.. do the same.. even if you escape with your views unchanged it's still a good reading.
