What else do you call it when you have the ability to understand something that others don't? Logical conclusion. But, you can name the fallacy I'm committing if you disagree.

 which is the incredible thing about bitcoin enthusiasts... for now
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:47:45
Really? I think it can actually be deduced through logic. Value investors believe bitcoin is worthless. Bitcoin investors believe it is valuable. Therefore, bitcoin investors believe value investors are wrong. But how wrong? Given the current price and recent gains, bitcoin investors' beliefs have been confirmed, and that it must be because they are intelligent and understand the technology. Therefore, those who believe it has no value are also stupid.

Confused is a good word here... it's the confidence that's dangerous. On the one hand, there are legendary investors and financial geniuses like Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, and John Bogle who are not confused at all, and say bitcoin is a fraud, the definition of a bubble, and should be avoided like the plague. Then there are VERY confident bitcoin advocates like the Winklevoss's, John McAfee, and endless tech bros who actually believe investing geniuses don't understand blockchain technology, and therefore the folks who have the deepest understanding in the world of investing are stupid and wrong. This is purely objective... I'm not advocating anything.

I'm pretty sure there is a huge chunk of the investing world that knows. Also, what does physics have to do with this? Also, what is information "theory." To me, bitcoin is a speculative bubble given all the evidence. What are the advocates betting on? That somehow a deflationary virtual asset that isn't inherently linked to the valuable technology upon which it is based, will remain unregulated, will eventually be used for transactions, AND will start replacing reserve currencies... hmmmm...

 If you could find an exchange that would loan bitcoin for shorting, the price would correct..., possibly to zero. This is why exchanges won't lend bitcoin for shorting. So, Twitter guy (OP?) has committed the rare impossibility fallacy, along with false equivalence (1. USD absolutely has intrinsic value, otherwise no one would work to earn it, 2. 99.999% of USD is used legally, versus probably less than 20% off bitcoin's usage for actual transactions). But, you'll never convince delusional idiots with truth.

You broke nothing. Futures are different from short selling. Also, i said use as a currency. Not trading. If you equate bitcoin with a security then you lost your argument from the outset. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:32:12
Caution, this is wrong. You need at least constant demand as well for the PRICE to go up, not value. The value stays the same. And the value of an asset like bitcoin can't be calculated until it has price stability like gold.

According to the article's rationale, hodl wave 7 will invert with hodl wave 6 and cause a reversion to the mean, which is $250. This will be called the Inverted Hodl Wave of 2020, and shall usher in a new era of bitcoin's use as a currency for drugs and secret killings. All the institutional non-hodlers will exit after shorting and taking your money.

You're wrong. I'm surprised you have never heard of the Great Depression. The Fed responded to the stock collapse by tightening monetary policy (increasing the value of the dollar, just like your valued bitcoin). A deflationary spiral resulted.

This is an incorrect conclusion to a good analogy. There is absolutely no reason for a rational consumer to spend a currency that is increasing in value so rapidly. That rational consumer will stop thinking about bananas and start thinking about cars, boats, airplanes, mansions..., and hoard as a result. Your use of bitcoin as a currency makes sense to you because you believe in it so much, but whether that belief is in line with the typical rational consumer is, at best, questionable.

Do you know what's happening with bitcoin right now? That's also very important. So is what's happening with the stock market, the federal funds rate, Libor. You left all these pieces to the puzzle out, and infinitely more.

That's not how it works. Businesses shutter, the services industries collapse (over 70% of the economy), and people end up in soup lines because there are no jobs. It's not that things become free. It's that demand disappears and along with it, jobs.

 Say we all use bitcoin and USD collapses in the future. Our bitcoin will steadily appreciate in value, which disincentives purchasing and encourages hoarding. A deflationary spiral and Great Depression is the inevitable result. It's horrendously irresponsible to encourage poor people to invest in something so risky and volatile.

 You have no clue, and are obviously lacking on the thinking front. You seem to have your head buried in bitcoin propaganda nonsense, so you think actual facts and history are an attack on your irrational beliefs.

This much excitement for BTC hitting 7.5k is not a good omen. A 10% bump, but still a 40% decline from a recent peak causing this much excitement is a bit scary imo.
