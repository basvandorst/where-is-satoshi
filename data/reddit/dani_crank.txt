This is awesome! Me and my wife did the same and luckily for us it did give us a beautiful baby boy after a year of going through the stress and pain of  IVF treatment. It is a struggle and takes a big toll on you’re mental health and strength. You will come out stronger through this no matter what and I really hope you get the pleasure of being a parent. I wish both of you all the best ❤️

Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:20:08
That’s the plan. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:38:40
Thank you and good for you to, congrats! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:16:26
It sure has and i hope you get that to!

I had the chance to complete my goal and did. I don’t know when it will go up or if it will continue down. And that uncertainty made me do it.

No troubles just withdraw it on multiple occasions not all at once and search your country’s tax laws and pay accordingly you will be fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:03:11
You are right! I will be back :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:55:17
This is so true. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:24:24
Good luck with that and hope you reach you’re goals. But you are invested and you have a heads up to people who have not yet discovered Bitcoin. That small investment might be a huge amount in the future! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:59:50
Thank you and of course this is just the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:04:49
Thank you and thanks for the thought. I did consider it actually but you are spot on. I just wanted to have it done so I don’t have the constant thought and headache that debt cause me and my family. And who knows it can sky rocket or nose dive tomorrow and that constant checking prices, that time will now be spent on the ones I care for the most.

Thanks and this comment made me burst out in laughter! So good. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:07:51
In this time and moment it is what’s best for me and my family. Still strongly believe in the technology. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:11:54
Best plan ever. I really hope everything goes well for you guys! It’s a tough journey to go through don’t forget to keep you’re heads up and stay positive especially you as you’re wife will take the most highs and lows from the hormones. It is so worth it and I really sincerely hope that it works out for you ������

Depends on where you live and what fees you are comfortable of paying. Search this forum it has so much information and help about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:22:04
Yes maybe in the future I might have had more money but you are right the feeling of being debt free makes it so worth it. Good for you! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:05:31
That’s the future plan. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:56:41
Thanks wish you the best and hope you reach you’re goal!
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:36:22
So true and of course we saved some to hodl ;)

Well you don’t have to read it. Just scroll past the next time. Nobody is forcing you to read it. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:02:17
All taxes will be taken care of ASAP. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:31:47
The debt were accumulated during this period. When I invested it was with my money and debt free but I get you’re point. This is a good advice though. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:01:13
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:42:45
Thanks and no not at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:20:25
Thanks for the tip and that’s the plan. Now my wife also wants to be in on a piece after this.
