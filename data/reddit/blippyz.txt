When people smoke, do you just stand there and do nothing, or do you smoke while doing other things or thinking about things you need to think about? I've never smoked so I'm curious

What's a hardfork and when is it happening? Haven't checked my btc in awhile and just came on here today because I saw the price was so high now 
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:43:05
So if you have a paper wallet with 2 btc in it, and it forks, do you now have 1 btc of each type? And the same private key would be used on each blockchain to access that 1 btc?

Out of curiosity what do people even use Western Union for? Why not PayPal or bank wire? 
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:39:47
What's the fee for international PayPal transfers? Every time I've used it it's been somewhere around 3%. Wires are a fixed $45. So for small amounts I always use PayPal and large amounts I always use wires.

Thanks for the reply. If you were to just go into online banking and set up a recurring transfer for $1 from checking to savings, and another recurring transfer for $1 from savings to checking, would that prevent it from happening? Or when they refer to inactivity do they mean actual spending / transferring to different accounts?

I was looking for the sweep option at blockchain.info earlier and couldn't find it. I know it used to be there so I assumed they had decided to just get rid of it.

Do you own physical platinum/gold/silver, like bars of them that you keep in a safe at home? Or do you mean buying them on the stock market

Does every bank do it and is it always 2 years?

Is this legally true or is it just a saying that people use to urge people to transfer the money into their own wallet? I've seen a lot of people saying that if you leave the coins on an exchange, they're not yours. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:05:53
Oh ok, I'll look into that too. But what happens if the hardware breaks, do you lose access to your wallet? 
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:13:01
Regarding storing on Coinbase, is that recommended? Just today I've seen at least 3 posts saying "DON'T STORE YOUR COINS ON EXCHANGES!!!" so now I don't know what to do either.

I also don't know much about ETH aside from the fact that Coinbase has it and I've started hearing it mentioned a lot. Are you using it for its actual purpose or just as a speculative investment thinking its price will shoot up like bitcoin's did? 
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:59:12
Thanks, to you and to the other commenters. This is my first time using Electrum so I wasn't sure if I was doing something wrong. I figured it might take slightly longer due to high transaction volume but when 21.co said "here's the amount for 30 minutes" and I more than doubled it but it still ended up taking hours, I got concerned. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:54:44
That makes sense, but the example reason you gave for the initial panic/decline was an exchange being hacked, so does that mean that technical analysis on its own wouldn't cause panics and that they are usually initiated by real-world events? Like say it's sitting around $4900 one day, will people just think "uh oh, it's getting too high, 5k is a nice round number and most people will probably cash out there, so I'll cash out at 4950" and lots of people thinking that will trigger a decline at 4950. Or is "other people will likely sell off at this arbitrarily selected round number so I'll sell slightly earlier" not a very common thing? (I'm not very experienced with trading so I'm just thinking about it from my amateurish perspective and what might cause me to sell) 
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:53:58
Thanks for the explanation, that was really interesting. So if the fact that something broke resistance is the primary cause for people buying more of it, does that basically mean a crash is inevitable, since the growth doesn't really have any "legitimate"/real-world cause? 
If so, what would cause it to start crashing at a specific time? Would the hype just start gradually declining and then after a short period of slower growth or no more growth, everyone thinks it's done and they all decide to cash out? Or is it decided more by round numbers, like you mentioned in your next comment, so people will just notice that it's at 2k and then sell it off, and then next time they'll all sell at 5k, then 10k, etc?
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:42:05
Whenever I hear someone talk about how they predict it will hit 100k or more I always think it's just wishful thinking from people holding large quantities of it already, and I can't stop thinking "ugh, give me a break."
But at the same time I guess if you had told someone when it was worth 10 cents that it would go up to $1k their reaction would've been the same. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:40:54
Why don't rich people just buy bitcoin too? If they're worried about a bunch of middle class people becoming rich, then the people who are already rich should just invest in the same thing and become even richer.

Is there a reason to use Trezor instead of a paper wallet, if you're just holding and not doing a lot of transactions?

Gemini's customer support is seriously insane. In the amount of time it usually takes to receive an automated "we have received your ticket and will respond to you shortly" email from most sites, you'll have received a reply from an actual human at Gemini. I don't know how it even makes sense. Either barely anyone emails support, or they have a massive number of people responding to tickets.

Out of curiosity, when you say life savings, what are we talking? Because there's a big difference between someone who's 50 years old cashing out his retirement fund to invest in bitcoin, compared to someone who's 20 investing his "life savings" of a couple thousand dollars.
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:26:47


what does that mean?

I think Coinbase requires Authy though, because I didn't even select it, I just tried to send btc and it told me I needed to download the Authy app and enter the code.

What's unsafe about a paper wallet? Encrypt the key using a passphrase only you know, print it, toss it in a safety deposit box and you're done. I've always thought paper wallets were a lot safer than keeping your entire balance in a client running on a PC you use daily.

I bought at various intervals from 100 up to 1000. The 1000 ones look like mistakes in hindsight, but hindsight being 20/20 and all that it could've just as easily dipped from 200 to 100 and had people thinking "fuck! I bought it too high!" I recommended it to a friend way back when it was at 400 and by the time he had his account set up it was at 500 and he didn't buy because he thought it was "too late now."
I don't even check the price every day anymore, my outlook is I've only invested money I didn't need anyway, and I don't have enough to where it would really change my lifestyle unless it shot up massively, so I'll just sit on it and see if it hits big. If it does then good, if it doesn't then alright. Maybe a few months down the line your $1000 buy will feel like you got in really low.

People make a big deal about this when it comes to bitcoin but is it recommended to do that with fiat as well (keeping your fiat in cash instead of in a bank owned by someone else)? The idea sounds kind of wonky but figured I'd ask just in case I actually am doing it wrong.

What if your computer gets a virus, can it not open Electrum and send all your coins to someone else's address?

He could send the coins to the buyer, then create an account on Freelancer or some similar site and have the buyer hire him for a job. He doesn't actually do any job, the price for the job is just the amount he's supposed to receive for the coins. Gets paid, looks legit. 
Though I should point out that my only knowledge of "money laundering" comes from seeing movie villains do it so may not be best to actually use this idea. Is this even money laundering? I can't tell if he's actually doing something illegal or not since he's basically just selling an asset that he bought legally anyway.

Is that just your own personal method or is it something that's generally recommended in investing / buying things? And what do you do if the answer is "I don't care" (if you're not leaning one way or the other towards either fiat or the crypto/product)?

In this example he would also owe tax in the Netherlands though, so does he pay his Netherlands tax (let's say 40%) first, and then 35% to the US on the remaining 60%? Or the other way around? Or does he pay 35+40 so that he's left with only 25% of the profit himself?

Is having it on a phone better than on a computer?
Is a hardware wallet better than a paper wallet?

Why is a paper wallet less secure than a hardware one?
Presumably you could also print multiple paper wallets with the keys encrypted, and keep them in different places. I've always thought paper would be better than hardware.
