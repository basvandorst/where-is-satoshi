Yep, true advantage. But. You're paying for this service. You pay it with fees. You pay it with your privacy.
You seem to be willing to pay a third party to give you this level of fraud-protection. You are okey to pay them so they take part of the responsibility away from you. You and like-minded folks will probably also do so in crypto-age. Heck, maybe it's gonna be a Bitcoin logo on your VISA one day. You can do this or will be able to - I will not use that though, I like my keys frozen. 


Yes. Same goes with pickpockets. Yes most probably you won't get that cash back. But you did not have your life savings in that now gone wallet. We developed skills for pickpocket-protection... you know, awarness signs, prevention campaigns, the police, better bags. The same will be true with bitcoin. 
When paradigms change, people will always try to copy/paste their old-paradigm patterns to the new one. Often they don't quite fit and it takes time to adapt. Then innonvation and with it adaption accelerates. BANG - suddenly you can't be without it.

Actually, that's the regulation i'm talking about. I'm not talking about regulation as in tax-stuff. I mean regulation in the sense of something like the Swiss National Bank defending CHF/EUR exchange rate. It won't let it go below 1.20.

why? if you want to buy EUR or YEN, do you want to do it within 10 seconds? where can you do this? (actually im my city i have ATMs for CHF, EUR and BTC. so i can actually do it in 10 seconds. Or let's say 60.


i don't understand that this keeps turning up. Even from quite intelligent critics as you are. Credit card confirmation takes 30 to 60 days, depending on your contract. The "confirmation" you're talking about (the "bling" sound at the cashier) is same instant with bitcoin. 


by whom? who will judge? don't you understand this is exactly an advantage of cryptos?
I agree with some of your points... but most of them just prove you didn't understand the problems that are solved by cryptos.

No dude. It must be SPENDING. I mean, buying products/services and pay using bitcoin. Otherwise it will not help in adoption / distribution. Dunno your org (bitangels)... should talk to your PR-guy though, the website smells like scam (sorry if it isn't... still the site looks like it and i left after reading few paragraphs)

I think you did not understand what i said, or I said it badly. The whales MUST spend their coins. Or there will not be enough coins for all the others. Or they will just be incredibly wealthy... which gives them even more power. I'm talking about 50 yrs from now. I'm talking 50% adoption (at least 50% of humans with money use bitcoin).
I did not talk about dumping. I said spending. Got it?
