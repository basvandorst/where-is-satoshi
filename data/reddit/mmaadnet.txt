No thank you, you are adding some good ideas that will help spread the BTC word. If he uses the Coinbase url he will need their legal approval. Any other ideas? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:59:35
most are per fight, some are per a period of time. Depends on how much BTC was raised
@_date: 2014-06-24 19:58:37
Nope but I am now. How do the processors differ? 
Do I have to accept in full coins? It seems like partial coins could buy a decent campaign or do we need to build campaigns that start at the BTC to Dollar value?

The company that owns the majority interest is First Data, they process the majority of credit cards around the globe. When PayPal started up FDC/WU responded with similar products. They tend to be responsive and a lot of people still use the service. 
Small fun fact, WU was in such a rush to respond to PayPal that they PR'd their new service. Unfortunately they had not secured the URL and the URL they used in the announcement was to a porn site.

thank you for the support. We made the "Pay with Bitcoin" button on the large side but only because we are proud to support the community.

thank you

Acceptance is about awareness. If PayPal took every defeat as and indication of future acceptance they would have shut the doors and not made it. 
I am aware of Doge based on their sponsorship. Now that I know the value is dipping I may buy some of those too. 
I think at this phase in the game, any cart or any horse should be considered a positive.

Right but he is not trying to secede from the USA he is saying that a state like California should be 6 states. Still under the US.

mmaadnet.com is accepting BTC for ads. We are a normal ad network offering IAB standard ads on over 80 websites. Over 3 million uniques per month.
@_date: 2014-07-06 04:50:03
it wasn't really an advertisement. It was his way of showing some love for the BTC community. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 22:41:43
that might not even be the right word. point is/was, he is a super smart, forward thinking and influential. IMO, a great person to have involved with BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:06:40
Those companies have to want to participate. 
As far as Dogecoin, a lot of people who have never heard of Dogecoin are now exposed and in a positive way. They are also recognizing the power of community when it comes to supporting an unsponsored driver. 
Also Chris is a business. As an individual and as the owner of a retail store in Colorado and an online e-commerce business. This communities interest in sponsoring athletes brought Chris and his business to BTC.

You have to understand crypto currency hurts Western Unions Parent company First Data. First Data process 80-90 % of all of the worlds credit card transactions. They are a fee based service provider who makes money on all of the debit and credit transactions.

The emergence of "viral marketing," as an approach to advertisement, has been tied to the popularization of the notion that ideas spread like viruses. The field that developed around this notion, memetics, peaked in popularity in the 1990s.[5] As this then began to influence marketing gurus, it took on a life of its own in that new context.
There is debate on the origination and the popularization of the specific term viral marketing, though some of the earliest uses of the current term are attributed to the Harvard Business School graduate Tim Draper and faculty member Jeffrey Rayport. The term was later popularized by Rayport in the 1996 Fast Company article "The Virus of Marketing,"[6] and Tim Draper and Steve Jurvetson of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson in 1997 to describe Hotmail's practice of appending advertising to outgoing mail from their users.[7] An earlier attestation of the term is found in PC User magazine in 1989, but with a somewhat differing meaning.[8][9]

When we started this the thought was native advertising would be better for publishers and advertisers. Unfortunately, that is just now becoming an important aspect for advertisers.
Don't let the name fool you, our demographics are mostly millennial males up to about 55 years old (OG MMA Fans). We have about 90 MMA publishers and they generate about 3m unique visitors every month. We get advertisers like Ubisoft, Proctor and Gamble, Fox, X Box way more than we attract MMA specific brands.
We also have about 30 YA Book Club/Fan Club publishers that attract 13-45 year old females. The do about 1 million uniques per month.
Many of our publishers rely on us to manage their social media accounts too so we can also reach similar demographics through social media posting, total reach is just over 2 million users with lots of organic engagement.
We will be encouraging our clients to accept Bitcoins, so we won't just be using them we will also be educating these clients about the BTC community. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:47:00
Yes I agree your design was cleaner, since BTC is so new we have to really work within some constraints. We added the URL to help bring awareness to the community. 
BTC is still new and Zuffa's legal department is not fully on board. For UFC 174 they denied a BTC logo and QR code (likely Rory). We were initially denied as well. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:16:28
I'm in. I bought coins, I am accepting coins, I am encouraging others to do the same.

They currently derive their income from transaction fees and the float. They are experts on making the most of the float.
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:31:59
our business is proud to accept Bitcoin, thanks to Coinbase and r/Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-07-03 00:37:26
Hitting a small road block with Zuffa legal. We are trying to get the approval but right now it is not happening.
We will try to use r/Bitcoin as a secondary solution because we have Reddit approved for this fight. 
Will keep you posted.

The thing about technology is that you are either ahead of the curve or behind it. Packard Bell, ALO, Netscape, Compaq, Gateway etc. Even giants like Barnes and Nobel failed because they failed to adopt to changing technology. 
I worked with a company (as a consultant) helping them understand there was more to online commerce then just sending money or making money on the float. That you could harness a lot of power by owning the transactions. We told them it was not about the P2P it was about owning the transaction. Coinbase and Bitpay seem to understand that. 
That company was Confinity and they had a product called PayPal. I can't say I am the reason it became what it became and would not want that credit, I can say they saw an opportunity and took a risk and became a defacto payment solution. It's a far from perfect solution, but enough people do not like Visa and MC so it became a viable solution. Now some sites start off accepting PayPal only and many brick and mortar chains now accept PayPal.
This can and looks to be happening much much faster for BTC's.
Yes we have some failures. Back when PayPal started a serial entrepreneur named Elon Musk founded X.com to challenge PayPal. X was a failure but PayPal brought Elon onboard and they set the world on fire.

um maybe the word annex is not correct. He is the guy behind the movement of converting California into 6 separate states.

eBay has some physical coins, Ttian is making coins still. I am going to buy one for keepsakes.

Who owns that B logo? They would have to be involved.
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:33:58
Yes and this is one of the biggest cards of the year.

PM me and I can get you in contact. His etail store is Big Commerce and he is using a Coinbase wallet. If you think you can help him we are all ears. 
Thanks for the link

mock ups
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:32:54
gave you an upvote and this is not a bad idea 
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:21:58
It is the right age demographic. The more they know, the more we all know the more the currency can grow. Awareness and adoption seem to be critically important.
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:08:27
It looks like that is your referral code, I did sign up so hope you get some coins.
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:35:13
Brad check out mmaadnet.com, we are now accepting Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:27:21
It was not about the free use issue IMO, we supplied all of that legal info with the mockups. Since we had Reddit approved, we were going to just put the r/Bitcoin URL. We explained why Chris was doing this and it seemed like that was enough.

Thanks, that is what I need

Okay we are live with Coinbase. Thank you u/BradStephens and r/Bitcoin.
Our adnetwork is now bitcoin ready. 
What makes us different? Aside from accepting bitcoin we work with our advertisers and publishers closely. A typical ad network sells ad placements and if those ads do not work you have to buy new ads, with us we allow advertisers to pull down non-performing ads and replace them. We also have out sites down to specific niches such as MMA or YA Books and Movies. So we can narrow down the audience for you.

Third generation investor. He is in early on Tesla, Baidu, Sype etc. He is the guy behind viral marketing. Also if you have heard about cities in California wanting to annex from the state of California he is behind that movement too.
The guy is a visionary. He did not buy the coins like most greedy investors would to sit on them. He is buying them, furthering the market and the net net is his remaining coins will eclipse his +18m- investment and at the same time increase the global acceptence of the coins.
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:36:28
Why not treat this like most MMA sponsorships where the payment is paid after the fight?
I think with ten BTC we should be able to be on the Tee shirt and main sponsor on ass or crotch.  
Sponsorship is likely due any day now
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:40:55
He is actually adopting the technology. 1) millions of Bitcoins targeted demo will see the message and can come here to learn more. 2) Chris owns a business that is setting up with Coinbase as we speak to accept Bitcoin at his business and is learning more from this forum. 3) this will be the exposure that alerts Zuffa to the fact that Bitcoin is an option. 4) Chris is a key reason we started accepting Bitcoin. So he is adopting and spreading the word. Seems good to me.
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:42:24
