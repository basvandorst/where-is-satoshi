**And you want me to trust the rest of you?"  I'm done with teenagers!  I dumped it all tonight.**
See ya!

I own a machine shop specializing in EDM (electrical discharge machining) and I made this for my awesome hot wife for Christmas, and also as test to see how small we could make one.  
This has 1,038 characters including spaces.  The material is 304 Stainless and the holes are .28mm diameter by .450mm deep (about 3.5 hairs X 6 hairs).  I drilled them on a CNC EDM drilling machine, milled the chamfers, then cut the outside on a CNC Wire EDM The holes are filled with dark red paint.   There are about 5,600 holes.  A BTC address would be about 1/3 this size or about the same size if we used a .5mm electrode.
This is durable enough to put on a keychain and not get damaged, has error correction and has a melting point of about 1410C (2570F); it would survive a house fire.
In case you are wondering, if someone wanted one like this, it would cost around $600.  A BTC address this size would be around $85.00 but the holes would be bigger (.5mm)  Using the same holes, a BTC address would be about $150.00 and the outside would measure about 19mm(3/4”) square or smaller.
We could even put a different address on the other side (BIP38 private key?)
BTW, wife, and her friends, think this is the coolest gift ever.

And people are trusting them with money?
