This is too speculative to be useful.

This sounds funny, but I'm being totally serious, I honestly feel that Zuck invented this coin with the hope of 1-upping the Winklvoss twins

The following is a copy and paste from the link in the original post:
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result."

Ive lost BTC using hardware wallets in the past do to my own user error. I don't trust myself to keep this much money. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:58:02
I'm willing to bet there are more people losing BTC from user error with cold storage wallets than those leaving BTC on an exchange

This made me cringe

I had a similar problem. It's actually a lot easier if you upload your verification identity using the coinbase app. It should then transfer that data to gdax. If I remember correctly this is what I did. also I believe that there is more variance in picture quality if you are using an Android phone which results in a more difficult time getting the image verified when I did this using my iPad as opposed to my Android phone I was quickly able to get my photo uploaded and approved give it a try and then report back.

Interesting. How much legitimacy is there to this claim and when will there be a resolution?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:34:04
My buddy did the same thing. Bought Litecoin because he couldnt afford a BTC.

I've never seen this, but I fucking love it! Here's another one I found

I thought seqwit2x was a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:31:52
I disagree that this is NOT fraud. People are downloading the wallet from this site thinking that it is for a different product. This is definitely fraud. Just call it bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:14:21
This is actually quite concerning. Are people on this sub not worried about this? I can see that I have been downvoted, but, based on history, have other people here been talking about this? Seems like a prominent issue to at least discuss seriously about...

According to coinbase, all digital currency is secure:

The  address is j*** he is a user quoting a comment from another user that of which the article claims is Satoshi...however I can't see the original commenter user name, so I believe the article associated the commented post with Paul because the website is based in a location where Paul used to live

ISPs will charge additional fees for using trading sites.
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:43:51
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:27:30
Looks like a screenshot from Google help forums from an unassociated user copy and pasting the passage...I'm guessing

In time, the price will fall. 
Never be fooled.
Never sell.
It will rise again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:29:00
Correct. 
You may be able to cancel the transaction by going to Accounts&gt;Transfers
I would then repurchase at coinbase, which will lock you in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:12:26
YOU DID NOT LOCK IN.
What you did was deposit USD from your bank account to your GDAX account. In 4 days you will see the money in GDAX as USD. 
In order to lock in, you must make the transaction via COINBASE. GDAX does not have this functionality. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:39:50
Dropped back to 10.5 on GDAX

I was hoping this was going to be a poem
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:55:20
OP, do you have a source that you'd recommend for someone trying to learn this? Im not understanding. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:08:58
awesome thanks
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:23:34
Any idea how these numbers theoretically change with quantum computing?
