That has literally happened multiple times and we are still here.

I just set mine up again on Saturday and intend to keep it up and running at all times.

I literally said this to myself today. I am doing my part. Holding and running my new full node. Good stuff.

I also use token based 2fa, but using mobile numbers as a secondary auth is more secure than nothing at all.

The phone confirmation is a critical security feature. They should require two factor authentication as well. I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to set up an anonymous email as well but I use Gmail for my main account, and it is critical that I have the ability to recover it in case of a hack. The phone link helps with this.

That's true. It still screws the retail stores, but the small manufacturers could sell to end users directly through OB using tor and skip the middle man

I was thinking the same thing. The taxes happen at the wholesale level so it might be a bit tricky still. Maybe moving your operations over seas and then selling to US through OB?

It's definitely gambling but you don't see me trading or leveraging. Just buy, hold, buy hold DCAing for years now.

The best high. Haha.

I would imagine running an UASF electrum server will be much more helpful than spinning​ g up non economic nodes? I may look into doing this.

Regardless of the efficiency of this particular miner this youtube video was impressive to me because I am aware enough of the basics of mining to know that this little machine, making all that noise, is producing a number of hashes per second that is unfathomable for my brain to properly imagine. With that being said I am also aware that this impressive machine, is actually completely insignificant compared to utterly unfathomable number that defines the current difficulty. Trying to wrap one's brain around the kind of numbers we are dealing with is exciting in itself and even more so when you also know it all contributes to the sense of security I have concerning the keys I believe to have in my control.
