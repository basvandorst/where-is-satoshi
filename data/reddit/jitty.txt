I also don't understand how so many bitcoin stocks retained their bid/ask despite the price of bitcoin going from $30 to $100.

Instead of spending marketing funds on an advertising campaign that might get a lot eyeballs and little traction, what about setting aside an amount of coin for a trusted bunch of bitcoin redditors (or moderators) to +bitcointip users of other subreddits for thoughtful/valuable/interesting comments. It might have more of a direct impact, as well as the potential of network effects as those users may then try to figure out how to spend their coin and/or get their friends to use bitcoin. I'm thinking and r/bestof in particular, since you'd be getting a double whammy of people witnessing what is happening in those subreddits as well as the originating subreddits of the posts.
Another bonus is that they don't have to worry about depositing cash for bitcoin to begin with, since they will already have some! It eliminates the barrier to entry and gets people using it (potentially).

Interesting article but not what I was thinking of. What I'm thinking of is older and possibly still in use today. I want to say it was used by either jewish or muslim store owners to transfer value to their kin across regions/countries, and it was the store owners that kept a balance of these value transfers back and forth. If I remember correctly, government didn't like the practice very much, as it undermined regulation or taxing.

Yeah. I'll usually study the market trends for a couple weeks, then buy high, and sell low.

His order number wasn't even that good! Anyone want to buy my Little Single order

If you're selling the "wallet", it just happens to be sealed with a private key inside. Maybe?

Any sort of feedback is welcomed. What sucks? What's good? What should the next feature be? Leave a review in the app store if you like. This was made because I wanted to see the current price in a live tile. Depending on the difficulty of it, the next feature may be a graph.

I wonder if anyone has tried selling and shipping a sealed (tamper proof) paper wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:15:11
If you are in the US, how much was shipping?

I thought arbitrage was a good thing, and what decreased wild fluctuations (at least, between exchanges)?

Yeah it was pretty jarring to see that up on the rack next to Wired et al. A little on the expensive side comparatively, priced at $8.88. But it had some interesting articles in there, including a Trezor interview, a tutorial on what looked like some CLI bitcoin-qt, and something about Obama/The Fed. I didn't buy it, but I kind of wish I did now. Maybe I'll head back on my lunch break.

Don't the Kochs have enough money already? No need to rub it in :(

Yeah. My morning routine usually goes - check bitcoin, check bitcoin once more, check bitcoin again.

that's perfect and reasonable, thank you. thinking about the possibility of a comma or period was infuriating
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:03:15
You just gave me a great idea of an open source node/js version that could be easily run locally.

I indeed have a 5S. Now that it is "a couple hours later" I tried launching the app again. Upon going to the sign in page, I receive an incorrect login/password error even though I didn't input anything. I then input my credentials, attempt to sign in, and again receive the "logging in too fast" error. This app is as useful as the previous edition Coinbase app ;) For those that don't know, this is not an app launch. It is a re-launch!

Don't have a link but he said something along the lines of "Oh I was wondering when they would reach that [power] issue, it's going to take them another month to figure it out." BFL denied it but here they are another month down the road making power adjustments.

Ha, what I really wanted was the 40K! You broke my tip cherry though, and for that I am grateful. Thanks for this. I will pay it forward by tipping a meaningful comment and another tipbot noobie :)

Missed their deadline again and didn't even own up to it. That company has been a huge disappointment. A twenty year old kid was able to ship first and in a shorter amount of time!

I also live in Baltimore. I can sell to you in person ;)

What's their margin

missed the tl;dr

I didn't find YOUR wallet, but I did find someone else's ;)
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:54:24
it was a book quote and a satoshi inside. felt nice ;)
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:10:49
Doesn't that image show the volume as 100k and 300k, not 10k and 30k?

Corner the market, raise the price. It's simple economics. 
They just forgot a step.
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:10:47
I didn't mix anything up.
