Never thought about that! V/MC Paypal essentially can censor the whole internet if they wanted to, at the behest of the US or UN, except perhaps BTC now. And even govs as you say.

I transfered money to MtGox from UK. It only took a few days, cost £10. Tip, choose US dollar as the currency if your bank supports that.
To sell you may still be able to use Intesango.co.uk, last time I looked they still had good prices. However haven't tried getting money paid out from them to a UK account?

I did try a test withdrawal of a small amount and after more than week it hadn't gone through. I cancelled it and then contacted their CS people. They said '...its been cancelled' : ). I lost the will to explain at this point as my feeding spoon was being used by a 1 year old.

Wow! I didn't realise Bitcoin was *this* clever. The whole idea of a blockchain is fairly logical, as a kind of shared ledger, but this kind forethought is very impressive. Who is this guy or guys/gals? They seem to have been incredibly clever and beneficent.

I agree. You could keep some wallets on the machine and some only in the back up thumb drive. So they would be invisible to any hacker, and anyway the encrypted ones would be no use to them as long as the password is fairly sensible AFAIU? If they just delete them out of spite you still have a backup, even for the ones that you keep handy, for everyday purchases.
@_date: 2013-05-28 12:07:30
I thought there was something like that going on. AFAICT the vast majority of internet users are consumers rather than producers of content, so most people would be loosers in that system, at least short term.

Normally there is some kind of rule that if you have already paid tax that you won't be taxed again, but as I say you would need proper advice. This can often be had for free from the relevant tax authorities themselves for an initial investigation.

If you look at ebay it is often days before the goods are dispached so for mail order it is not a problem.
For anywhere where it might be a proble an online wallet would work best. The customers bitcoins are held by the wallet company and they are well-confirmed. The merchant just has to trust the wallet company, not the direct customer. So the first confirmation should be fine (this shows the right addresses have been used etc).

Money is the same as a token or a voucher except it is more widely accepted, that is the only difference. Dollars are a voucher issued by the US government and accepted nearly everywhere, however ultimately they remain the property of the US and they decide how many to issue or destroy. The vast majority of US$ issued is in the form of digital currency by private US banks. They literally type the figures into their computer system, under US gov licence, and US$ come into existence as debt (see Money as Debt film).
Bitcoin is a voucher generated by a computer programme which has no central computer but is run on a peer-to-peer network. The programme itself issues the currency and cannot change how and when it issues currency or decide to change the upper limit (21 million BTC). So everyone knows the currency cannot be debased and that it is fair. To incentivise people to run the programme on their computers they are rewarded with the new BTC that are issued and fees for transactions.
The great advantage BTC has over other currency tokens is that it is not controlled by people but essentially by mathematics. No one has the power to create new BTC which would devalue all previously existing BTC (aka inflation).
It is also not issued as a debt but as a credit in the BTC ledger (aka the blockchain). The blockchain is basically a shared bank account containing all the existing BTC. This is also run by the Bitcoin software mainly by all the computers mining for new bitcoins. When you 'transfer' BTC really you are transfering the right to use a certain part of the shared Bitcoin internet bank account. It is as though you could transfer say $100 of the credit in your bank account to someone else. They could then access your account but only that particular part of it, using a special password say. Then they could decide what they do with the $100. This is almost exactly what happens with Bitcoin. Each BTC has a special password, and this is what gives control of it.
Just like credit in any internet account it can be instantly transfered from one computer to another. So it is like cash on the internet, or digital US$. This makes it ideal for internet transactions of almost any size, and therefore it is very quick and cheap for such transactions.
At the moment the value of all BTC is about $1.5 billion. If BTC became a major player as a token of exchange it would need to be worth 100-1000 times more than that. IOW $150 BN - $1.5 trillion, and it would still be a fairly minor player in international markets, even at those levels. Currently the price is around $125 each, and about half of all BTC are already existing. If all 21m existed tommorow presumably the rpice would immediately fall to half the current price, $62.50. So to be even a fairly minor player the price would need to go up say 500 times that, which is around $30,000 each BTC.
That cannot happen very fast most likely. It might take decades, and might well not happen at all. But if it does that will make everyone who buys 35 BTC today, and who holds all of them, a millionaire. Not only that but they will know that those BTC will keep increasing in value most likely as no more will come into existence. Indeed some get lost or go out of use for various reasons. And the economy of the world is generally increasing as well, BTC would track that quite well I would expect.
Litecoin and Namecoin are related digital currencies which would probably also play a role in this scenario and are worth looking in to as well.

I agree with you. I sense an acceptance even perhaps a welcoming of Bitcoin in political circles. There is clearly a co-operative relationship between big banks and big politics, but there is equally a competitive one as well. Neither side is under any illusion that the other side would take them over completely if they could. However they are actually in a kind of stand-off. Surely Bitcoin is quite useful for the political side of this stand-off. At least it provides some alternative to the money-powers, it can be used to keep them somewhat in line, a kind of stalking horse. Ideally then the political side might like to see bitcoin grow to a certain extent. The financial side are then left with one alternative really, if you can't beat it you better join it. Could be rose-tinted glasses tho : ).
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:35:58
Thanks for that reply, I'm starting to understand a bit!
@_date: 2013-05-29 06:53:08
Do you know what bitcoin address you requested MTGox to send the bitcoins to? If so is the client that created that address up to date on the blockchain download?
@_date: 2013-05-28 12:12:11
That is why I was suggesting an *on line* wallet company. The merchant just has to trust them, not the customers who they probably have no previous relationship. The end customer could have an ongoing trust relationship with the online wallet company. IOW keep a small balance with them and maybe even set up some kind of semi-auto top up system like Skype have.
@_date: 2013-05-29 07:53:24
For me it is not a question of this or that threat to bitcoin. The real question is how robust is the bitcoin system in general. AFAICT it has been designed as a robust system, with the atittude of making it as robust as possible rather than looking at particular threats to it. It has shown itself very robust so far, and I would say it has the resources to enhance its robustness in terms to talent, users, effort and now cash. So it started as a very robust system by design, it has got stronger and stronger and now it is very strong. It may be stronger than any government or even groups of governments. By trying to attack bitcoin they might well just make it even stronger IMO if they do, and loose any chance of peacful coexistence.
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:14:52
Fair enough.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:03:31
So the address is actually more than an address, it is also a kind of key? I am probably sounding very 20th century to some of you guys : ).
So when the sender uses this address they are really using a kind of public key which is linked to a private key. This pk was generated by the client when it created the address, stored in the wallet, and only with that private key can the publickey/address be decoded. At that point somehow access to the bitcoins is enabled, specifically the ability to 'send' them to someone else?
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:58:40
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:01:30


Because of where the longest part of the blockchain has got to?
IOW is it the blockchain that ensures which private key has control of any particular coin at that time? I guess it is.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:12:41


This is the claim the whole piece revolves around. Is it true? These are very unique numbers that are being paid for. They can be used to send money almost instantly across the internet for free. They can be used to store your wealth where no government of even thief can get it. They give you access to a massive network which serves to protect these things through open source software, mining, PtoP sharing, encryption etc.
So the real reason that people are willing to exchange $89 for a Bitcoin is the value it has for them relative to the money. They can hardly all be speculators considering between 1-2 million Bitcoins change hands every day!
Myself I am mainly a speculator. I think they are massively UNDER valued at present. This is for a lot of reasons. They are very new and people are still learning about them and adjusting to this new idea. In fact probably only a small percentage of the world population have even heard about them, yet. The infrastructure to support their use and storage is very much in its infancy but is getting a lot stronger and quickly! If Bitcoins even cornered 2% of world trade by 2050 they would probably be worth well in excess of $100,000 each. I don't think $90 will look like a bubble by then, or if this happens a lot earlier.
Also I am politically in favour of Bitcoins. They offer an alternative to debt money (see Money as Debt film on YouTube) and we desperately need an alternative, just look at the financial system. It is something free, made by the people, for the people and it cannot be controlled by anyone except the people. This is a truly democratic, free market, international currency, no wonder some are so scared of it.
Edit: This was a comment by the author on his own blog page. I think it shows he is biased it what he has written (aren't we all) as he clearly hasn't researched Bitcoin much:
"Anthony Migchels permalink
Well, 1 billion in capital outstanding should provide 1,4 billion in yearly trade if the Bitcoin circulates at the slow pace of the dollar. I’d be completely and utterly shocked if it came even close to that.
Do you have data on Bitcoin turnover?
I fully agree with your Freicoin analysis."

Very interesting. And presumably you could encrypt them first, so even if they are found it is going to be next to impossible to read them?
What would be the advantage of that over sending them to yourself via email? Or uploading them onto a server, as ways of backing up the private keys?

I think you are bringing up a very interesting and important issue. I absolutely agree that giving money to child porn is encouraging abuse of children and therefore is violence against children, and is immoral. I personally would be delighted to furnish any information that might help to reduce such violence, and would fully support anyone else doing that.
Maybe we need a community statement on such issues that people could sign up to? Like a Bitcoin Declaration of Rights and Responsibilities? Maybe we could also have some kind of Bitcoin Policing Foundation that could serve to investigate cases of misuse, as defined in the Declaration, so that individuals could check that their National Police have got good reason for asking for this information?
This would all be to *aid* the individual in being a responsible member of the Bitcoin community, rather than force them to be one. And, as you say, improve Bitcoin as a social proposition and asset.

I am struggling to understand the ideas put forward in this video. He seems to be saying that the old model of maximising profit at the expense of the whole [network] has been shown to not work anymore. So Adam Smith's ideas that if we just follow our own interest's social goals will automatically be met, is no longer always valid. Compuetr technology has reached a point where we can gain too great an advantage and actually damage society, on which our businesses ultimately rely? Is this what you get? What are the solutions to this? He seems to have in mind some kind of information social dividend for everyone? He doesn't explain very clearly here.

Just in case there is a keylogger on the connected machine?
@_date: 2013-05-30 17:53:04
I suppose in a purely technical sense you are correct. The way I meant it was more a kind of poetic sense of the word. Like if someone made a 'violent verbal assault' it is not actual physical violence, of course, but it explains the underlying tone very well. I think child abuse and rape is motivated by the same kind of impulses as physical violence in many cases.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:29:06

Who would trust a website with this kind of money?
Edit: The answer to my own question: The owner of the web site would trust it with this much money, and probably only the owner of the website. Therefore this is a publicity stunt. The hidden part of the 'pass phrase' is really an **unguessable** string of random characters, so don't waste your time.
This is an attempt at viral marketing. BUSTED!

'This' refers to just not switching on the client. The wallet file still contains the way to access the bitcoins and this is what needs to be stored securely.


All I have sent to sender is the address! When they send btc to that address the blockchain is changed to show that address has these btc right? And this address is public? So what is to stop someone just typing that address into their client (or some kind of emulator) and fooling everyone that this is their btc? IOW at what point is my pk associated with the address within the blockchain? Is in when I generate it? Surely it must be? Or is it when my client 'claims' this address and btc in some way?
@_date: 2013-05-29 07:00:02
I would say as soon as it enters the banking system it will become known to Country B's tax authorities. 
However in most countries AFAIK you are taxed on income not just bringing capital into the country. You could just phone up Country B's tax dept. and ask them what liabilities you might incur. I would be surprised if there were any except those normally associated with buying a house.
If there would be income tax payable then maybe you/they could buy the house using an offshore company. (Note you need proper tax advice probably).
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:55:39
That is pretty hardcore. How much more secure would you estimate that method is compared to just encrypting the wallet/s and backing them up as you would any other important file (on a distant machine, thumb drive at your parents place etc)?
@_date: 2013-05-28 10:10:13
There are lots about. Just try them with a small amount first a gradually bbuild up. Okpay seems ok but may also be stopping the service.

One big reason is that the mainstrem media has not really pushed the issue *at all* at least to my knowledge. I suspect most people do not know much about it. I can say I know very little myself. Just that HSBC has been fined for certain lax practices *that led to money laundering*. AFAIK they have not admitted deliberately aiding criminals. More like turning a blind eye at the worst?
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:27:25
OK so this wouldn't be a good way to store bitcoins as the wallet file would still need to be protected anyway?
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:20:50
So can I just check I am understanding this.
I have 2 clients A and B. Using A I generate a receiving address, switch that client off. Then I switch on client B, send to that address. Now only client A can receive those coins out of all the clients in the world?
Is this because when A generated the receiving address it also generated some kind of key? So the key is sent to the blockchain when the address is generated? Then all the clients know that you need that key to access that coin? 
In that case if someone stole the wallet file of client A would they still have access to the coins?
@_date: 2013-05-28 06:04:24
Presumably it would be easy enough for some kind of online wallet company to offer guaranteed payments. They have the person's bitcoins already, fully confirmed, so the merchant knows the wallet company has the bitcoins. If the wallet company says 'bitcoins are on the way', and maybe one confirmation after a few seconds, that should be perfectly safe in 99.9999% of the cases. That would all happen as fast as Paypal I would say.
@_date: 2013-05-28 05:54:28
Not sure exactly what you want to learn about? 
What is bitcoin?
It is a new form of money, IOW a way for people to exchange a token in place of things of real value. This token has a nominal value in relation to things of real value as agreed through some kind of free market, ideally. Bitcoin is different from other tokens, such as dollars or pounds, in that it is not issued by some central body or authority. Instead it is issued by a computer programme that runs on all the machines in the bitcoin network. The amount of the bitcoins in circulation is built into the maths underlying the operation of that programme and has a maximum of 21 million. This all means that everyone using bitcoins can be confident that no one will start producing more and reducing the value of the ones they have, like with dollars and pounds.
Where to buy bitcoins to put in your wallet?
If you are in the US this fairly easy as you can use various exchanges (mtgox.com btc-e.com are large ones) AFAIK and bitinstant.com. In the UK it is a bit more difficult than it was as the banks seem to want to be akward
 and have shutdown excgange's banking facilities. I had to send money to Japan!
This guy is one of the best explainers about Bitcoin in terms of the bigger picture:
Search his name on Youtube for videos.
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:57:56
At what point does my wallet have the private key? What if it is not running when the payment is sent? Is the pk in an email server somewhere?
@_date: 2013-05-28 06:00:29
If you have BTC that you want to sell for Dollars that should be easy enough. Just open an account with someone who accepts BTC and can pay out dollars into a US bank account. It is very easy to transfer BTC, obviously, and from MTGox just takes a few minutes IME. I understand OKpay is also still functioning with MTgox and Bitinstant is something to consider.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:05:15
So I could send from one client to another one, even on the same computer. While I leave the second client off the coins are in a kind of limbo? Is this an almost perfect way to store coins securely? Or could someone else use the address somehow?
