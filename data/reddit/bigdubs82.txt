Good call, you're tip of the spear, buddy. Maybe I should reset my stop loss a little higher than 5k? Maybe 9500 isn't good enough...

Demand determines value directly. Bitcoin's value changes all the time - depending solely on its use cases - and ignoring speculation. Political environment, regulation, tx fees, ease of use, manipulation; this list is too long to type. Bitcoin's overall value is entirely driven by how many people want to or are able to use it, for trading, remittances, storage of value, whatever... This is supply and demand.  If you're asking what the actual value of blockchain is, and not Bitcoin, that is a completely different argument

That's trading... cut your L's and let your gains run. Following your example when would anyone buy? I'm a trader not a hodler, I want a few grand a day to cash out, long term who knows what's going to happen... take the money and run, whatever you wanna do with your crypto is fine by me

Well done!

And anyone who thinks Trump doesn't own any Bitcoin is kidding themselves LOL

Use a legit Bitcoin trading exchange that deposits into fiat... Gemini, QuadrigaCX

I've never quite understood anyone who didn't like Bitcoin. Maybe it's the community you don't like, the negative media attention, process to purchase - but what's not to like about a global, borderless, anonymous medium of exchange that has the ability to change lives for people with horrendous governments, those sending money to family while working overseas, etc, etc, etc.... I suppose it's a generational thing, why my grandfather didn't trust the internet, always carried cash, didn't trust an ATM - always had to go into the bank to a teller lol.
I think it's this reason we all invest in crypto, there isn't actually much to dislike when you look beyond the bullshit. I can't think of one argument against the actual innovation of blockchain.....

Just so you're aware, Robinhood makes money on the spread. It is definitely sustainable and logical, in fact this is likely the biggest news for cryptocurrency in a long, long time. Exposure, access, and ease of use has been the largest obstacle to crypto, and Robinhood is going to put a big wrench into that. This is HUGE news and it's being under-reported

Supply and demand. Which is directly correlated to it's use cases, which with Bitcoin are far greater and more impactful than most people give it credit for. The people who need projects like Bitcoin also have the hardest time accumulating them, which is the real shame with it

Also Tron and Tether are still scams but remain functional. Act accordingly
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:46:51
I don't think a widely successful and forward-thinking company like Robinhood will be running away with people's crypto. There is far more to be made in crypto from greed than crime. Robinhood is going to make a fortune, a legal fortune.
You could be right though, maybe if you're so worried you should invest in a savings account lol

Buy between $10k-$11k, sell between $11.5-$12k... I've been doing this steady for a week, massive returns... My $.02

Blockbuster turned down Netflix for 50 million. Yahoo turned down Google and Facebook. Most people only see a sure thing once it's a sure thing, and by then all the people who saw the potential have already made millions and the margins are small. Pretty sure Verizon turned down Apple as well. Let people hate, they'll only love crypto once it's mainstream and they'll tell you all about buying into Ethereum at 7k and being excited about how it's going to make them rich lol

Bitcoin ATM's, Localbitcoins

Is this how you as a VC would go about determining which cryptocurrency to invest in? If so, are you implementing the same metrics for long/short term positions?
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:53:02
This guy gets it. Average your buys as the market drops down but those same futures that initiate these dumps are going to go long and initiate them back up
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:43:39
Now this right here is what we need more of.... this is adoption. If you're going to continue to send bitcoin maybe even back and forth I suggest you get into an exchange where you can easily send/receive and cash out. Good luck

No one on here can afford a bullet

Put..... the bong... downnn....

No clue, but for you to receive and cash out, better handle your incoming deposits and just in general have an easier time, you're better to give him your exchange address so when he sends you anything you can cash out as soon as it's sold on the exchange into fiat and withdrawn to your bank account

There is nothing to research about Bitcoin he says.... the creation of blockchain technology and there's nothing to research. Solving the double spending problem, decentralizing currency, global remittance structures designed to take advantage of the poorest people in the world finally challenged, an attempt to bring anonymity back to personal finance, a revolution in computing like few in mankinds history.... "nothing to research" LOL... some people really do deserve to lose all their money, by the sounds of it it was you, that makes me happy
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:33:20
I will buy your Bitcoin

This Rosic guy is the most depressive and ridiculous character on YouTube, my brain hurts listening to him pretend like he understands economics of 'the unbanked'. 'I know people who have been there'.... unreal. This guy actually bothers me, his ignorant, uninformed opinions and the confidence he has in them is actually gross. 
Ask a well traveled military man if you want to know the reasons the unbanked are unbanked, it's not because they want to remain private and anonymous lol... what an embarrassment

Start a company and accept Bitcoin as payment for service

The big money is waiting in the weeds, not googling "BITCOIN" when the news covers the next bullrun.
