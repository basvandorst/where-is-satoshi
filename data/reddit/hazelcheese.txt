All joking aside gold has a lot going for it:
* Relatively unreactive. If someone made something with it, like for instance coins, they weren't going to corrode much over time.
* It was very easy to mine and it comes out quite pure.
* It's very easy to manipulate. Before we had big industrial machines this was important.
* It's rare. Getting hold of it requires interacting with the few that have it and their free to set their price with little competition.
Imagine a world without plastic or big machines capable of creating and bending all kinds of metals. Gold is suddenly very very valuable for crafting and makes for an excellent coin metal.

Believing in what though? Believing it's going to become a widely used currency or believing that it's an asset that's value will keep going up.

Not to nitpick but gold is valuable because before inventions like plastics and certain alloys stopping your metals from rusting was a full time job. Medieval armies literally carried barrels of sand when they went to war just so they could roll chainmail in it to remove the rust.

They existed but they were paid for entirely by the people living on them and businesses that used them. So if your happy to do that I guess you'll be fine. Enjoy paying tolls everytime you leave your local area I guess.

Wut. You guys don't want roads or schools I guess?
