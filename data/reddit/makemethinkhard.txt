Thanks for replying, I just checked the retail rates for shipping from the UK to Germany, and €40 is not far off the best offers I could find. What a bummer.

It is very relevant to your bet. If just 0.0000001 xbt trades for $5000/xbt it's not really a strong indicator, similarly as ltc traded for 0.001$ just a couple of weeks ago on some exchange.
Exchange and conditions are very relevant, since flukes can always happen when then order book is thin, lag is high or exchanges under attack.

Eh DHL should first of all learn how to deliver packets to the correct address, on time, and do a correct and timely customers declaration. The last few deliveries from DHL ended almost half a mile away at some random neighbours house, despite being at home and waiting all the time. Took 3 days to catch the neighbour and pick it up..........

I'm not quite sure how these regulations in detail play out in your country, but usually there is a presumption of innocence, and a burden of proof. If something fishy is going on, the bank should notify the appropriate organs rather than cancel the business relation.

It's true, it IS pure specuation, and with that volatility any good portfolio is unlikely to have &gt; 10% bitcoin. But that is not what we are doing here when owning bitcoin. We're not building optimal portfolios, we're not "investing" into growth and revenue share.

No, gold is not created internally. Bitcoin is, and with a network majority it is possible to easily increase e.g. the total number of coins. 
Gold is used and required outside a community of gold miners.

I use lieferservice.de to buy pizzas, and you usually can just replenish your spent btc around the same price you spent them for, keeping your hoarded amount of btc constant.

I'm not sure why the central point is always money being legal tender.


There is a community and even a law (the bitcoin protocol) as well as an authority to change it (the majority of the network). It's a bit less traditional, but the definitions still fit.

Congratz, you discovered options, futures, swaps and a number of other derivatives.

@_date: 2014-02-21 21:48:42
Yes, indeed, I'm a bit wacky, because I'm assuming that know-your-customer and money laundering rules only force you to notify authorities, as burden of proof and presumption of innocence still hold up. 
It's not that banks are scared of laundering money, faking and falsifying interest rates, assisting in tax fraud, hosting pyramid- or ponzi schemes.

I don't understand your logic at all.
Calling a non-gay person a fag is supposed to work as an insult, but the whole process is not disrespectful towards gay people? It kind of implies that there is something wrong with being gay in itself, otherwise it would not be an insult or anything bad.

If there weren't any FTC  rules and customer protection rules, you could be right, but in fact they did make up their own and unrefundable "preorders" without delivery dates are not allowed.

Thanks for providing a full quote of the regulation.
That's horrible. I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
Here, in the country I live, banks cannot even deny a specific customer a non-credit bank account if they offer one...randomly canceling accounts wouldn't fly well at all.

You don't even know short selling but complain about market manipulation?
Short selling is when you borrow a bitcoin and sell it immediately, and then later buy it back cheaper, hand the coin back and keep the profit from selling earlier to buying cheaper later. It's basically the opposite of buying bitcoins, but you have to borrow a bitcoin first to have something to sell.
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:42:47
The problem with statements like "bitcoin is still up xyz% over period abc" is of course the bunch of people that got onto the train at $1000 or more per coin. They are down 50% or even more. And there is lots of people who believe that they can "invest in" rather than "speculate with" bitcoins and do not know about diversification or risk management, not to speak of any portfolio theory.
Of course it hurts when your net worth drops by two digit percentages, especially when you're not used to it.

No, and regulation isn't bad. But implemented horribly.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:19:04
Why? You can make offers as high or low as you want, that does not manipulate the market? It is quite stupid to assume the last market quote as the value of your whole stash of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:41:54
So I exchange $1000 into Bitcoin a minute before I buy, then immediately spend it. That doesn't affect my holdings in bitcoin at all? In the end, I can't stop buying and consuming just because there is a good that might make all my possessions more valuable over time. There is many things that grow in value over time and it doesn't stop people from consuming or spending it.

You can't fork a GPL code and have future versions of it have another licence. That's why we have the mess with LGPL for libraries in the first place. If they forked and published a binary, they are in a very clear violation of the licence.

there are also options and futures on bitcoin vs. us-dollar, as well as on the mining difficulty (which you can use as a vehicle on mining efficiency using current hardware and energy costs) to model shorting or profiting from dropping bitcoin prices.

You don't need to be dumb for that, but you can avoid that hassle of having to take care of foreign currency conversion and the fees, you don't need to pay fees for wire transfers or Paypal, you don't need to own a credit card or put it on it, and especially for small amounts the fees of e.g. western union is just ridiculous, more than 40% when transferring amounts below $10.

That report was utter bullshit. They did not explain how bitcoins work, they didn't even mention the public ledger or anything. They kept talking about computer pools solving digital puzzles, which is just a tiny aspect, especially if you omit the point that this proof of work serves to verify ownership, transaction and integrity of the payments. No one can even begin to grasp what bitcoin is about from that segment of the news.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:49:52
Nah, you are totally on a tangent to that article. It actually does some model calculation to relate the hashing power of BTC to energy consumption and its associated carbon footprint. That's not in itself negative, it's more like saying that communting to work daily, on average for 30 miles, creates a footprint of size x.

It aims at replacing text messages, which are in nature push and not pull-services. 
Gibberbot uses XMPP and OTR and each of these technologies come with their own issues:
1) XMPP requires an active connection and that in itself is a problem. threema uses push-notifications upon new messages. That is easier on power consumption and possibly on data/bandwidth.
2) OTR requires a live session for key exchange - that makes it very hard to write messages to someone who is offline, unless you start storing the OTR keys long time and do not, as intended, get a new one with each session.
Both are horrible on platforms that do not allow background apps to run as a service and do a lot off stuff off-screen (e.g. iOS). Threema, like whatsapp, viber, hike and other mobile messenger solutions rely on push notifications to send messages and make the user bring to program back up to process them. 
Also OTRs intention was to offer malleable, deniable encryption whereas threema just offers a push-service with public key encryption.
I mainly posted it because everyone is going quite crazy over the whole heml.is thing, but this is an app that already offers most of what the others are trying to crowdfund. And you can by it off-store with bitcoins.

But just as long as it works, and then they have useless hardware that they would need to pay to get rid off. They might not be making the biggest profit from selling them right away, but it is a more stable, reliable and less risky approach to it. And I bet that is why they do it. Have some happy customers, constantly sell the hardware is better than not knowing the return.

I think even if there is an altcoin up and coming, investing now won't kill you. Total valuation of all bitcoins is 2.6 **b**illion, whereas litecoin as the biggest altcoin is 59 **m**illion.

Yeah, do read up on these issues. Bitcoin markets are the most unregulated over the counter market at all.

That's why I didn't mention blockchain, but public ledger. And I think that is the central point of the bitcoin protocol: having a public ledger that is verified constantly and thus trustworthy because you can only add to it if you prove ownership with modern cryptography.

That is not a detail, that is the main mechanism of bitcoin. It is dangerous to make bitcoin something obscure that requires a special group to solve puzzles to receive them for free ... instead of horribly trying to explain mining they should have focused on Bitcoin's features.
