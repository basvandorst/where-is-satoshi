No offense, but this sub isn't particularly unbiased either...
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:52:55
It goes both ways
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:46:21
Sadly, that's crypto for ya.. most posts on r/bitcoin is just berating r/btc, I've already sold all of my bch so I'm not on either team here
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:34:41
And vice versa, who cares. I browse and comment both and because I'd like to absorb as much information as possible.
Yes, clearly the two subreddits are heading seperate ways, but don't forget isn't all about BCH, it's just that BCH-Enthusiasts refrain from commenting on because of people getting banned, and seeing how is a smaller sub with less activity, naturally the majority turn to as opposed to @_date: 2017-11-10 01:44:58
Where's my BazingaCoin
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:07:23
Jeez this poor man has a family!
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:06:26
Nah, I've got both BTC and BCH, but for some reason when you own BCT you must say "bcash", Just call it by its name
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:57:14
Can we talk about it on this Sub is the real question
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:00:34
Hi I sent BTC and in result I received uncurable diarrhea. I now suffer from diarrhea every second of my miserable life.
Let this be known.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:06:09

@_date: 2017-11-12 01:04:07

@_date: 2017-11-18 15:22:09
Why can't we all be friends
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:54:55
I think 21 million Bitcoin in total
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:18:58
Here I gave you an upvote
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:10:14
Am I being downvoted because I bought BCH and browse lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:00:51
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:30:12
Their prices are correct, because the sites have their own market
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:23:20
Anything that goes against BTC 
and is where people go when they get banned
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:21:32
People selling cause it spiked
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:37:43
Their price is based on trades made on their site, sucks being european isnt it lol, trying to buy the coin that may not be named, but on LiteBit it's literally 10% more expensive,, pffff.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:23:34
