most of these coins have potential and unique tech. i will admit most buyers are in it for the hype (cough...ripple) but some of them offer solutions to scaling issues and world problems as well.

went on bitcoin.com, clicked on information, presented with [this article](
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:54:08
bitcoin cash might not be a scam, but bitcoin.com is. seeing that they are using the name of the most popular and dominant crypto in order to increase traffic from noobs, while convincing them that a different thing is the real bitcoin.
but i mean if you support a coin with like 2 miners cheers to you.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:52:40
true, maybe i don't believe in bitcoin. it relies too much on coinbase IMO. if the company got hacked, too many new investors storing their coins on the exchange would lose their minds and panic sell.

dude i don't even know how my toothbrush works, i ain't know how this alien stuff goes down
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:09:28
i hope this is a joke, price has been hovering around here for a full day
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:19:31
why would you do this.  are you trying to support a future currency or make a bubble? bitcoin's price is the result of supply and demand. are you really trying to create a mass pump and dump?
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:39:49
yes, i mine bitcoin on my brother's ipod touch. i already made $10.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:05:31
not that kind of nightmare, i stored my coins off the exchange. but obviously a hack to the largest exchange would hurt the price a lot.

iota is probably one of the best examples. they cooked up some tech called "tangle." with tangle, every time a transaction is sent, 2 other transactions are confirmed. so tangle actually gets faster as the network grows. this is why iota currently sends in about 30 seconds with no fees. as iota grows, they expect to complete transactions in 1-3 seconds.

tell that to the ethereum market cap

actually, i have never filed taxes before. last year i was just a kid and thought that the w-2 took the exact amount of taxes i needed. didn't even think to file a return even though i didn't make enough to owe any tax.
i'm super scared this year because i have worked on w-2 and 1099, plus i have been making gains off crypto. going to be complicated. but i guess i'll figure it out.
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:58:32
so since you don't know how an airplane works it's also a false claim?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:20:08
you're right it is just sitting there, but i obviously had too much btc because it was stressing me out. i fully believe in the success of bitcoin but i had nightmares and anxiety about a disaster such as coinbase getting hacked and the price dipping for 3 years. and i will need that money soon because my life costs money :(
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:15:23
yeah i was kind of thinking the same thing about US dollars. i mean like everyone already has them. there is no more public to buy in. plus, dollars don't even have assets and returns. that is why i think the value of a dollar will be 0 dollars soon. thank you for listening.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:10:11
yes, you do have some good points there. i do concede that yes, college is not right for everyone. many alternatives are rising. tons of people are going to college for professions that don't require it. i just don't understand why musicians and artists go to school?
i would say college is the best option for me, since i want to do research.
for a lot of people, they will be better skipping school and getting right into work.
thanks for bringing some different views to the table.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:38:19
i disagree with OP, but is this really an echo chamber? is r/bitcoin a place we can go just because we are scared about our investments and we want everyone else to tell us it's going up?
serious question. we need to allow some opposing opinions here, even if they are wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:45:00
r/woosh i guess, lol
really flew over my head sorry

i don't have experience with all 3 but i do with bitpay.
it converts everything to fiat to send, so it is just the feeling of using bitcoin and not actually paying in bitcoin.
we haven't had too many problems with it. one problem i recall is a customer double paid, once with card and once with btc. they wanted a refund for the btc but that was too difficult so we just refunded the card.
another problem is with the appreciation of bitcoin and the conversion, we have received a few payments that were underpaid by about a dollar or less. kind of annoying.
just my two mBTC about bitpay, not sure on the others.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:28:39
is everyone in this comment section here from r/btc to spread FUD?
this is getting out of hand. bch might be better, but the people associated with it are shady AF. i feel like more than half of the people in this thread are against bitcoin. they have their own subs to lurk in if they really have a "better" alternative.
go check out these subs instead of bullying us
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:35:22
this isn't bitcoin's fault, it is Bitpay and Newegg.
Bitpay immediately converts bitcoin payments into FIAT, so if the price changes while you are transacting, a business might not have as much money as the person sent. I don't get why Bitpay decided to do this and why no alternatives have come up yet. if businesses accept bitcoin, they should receive it in bitcoin.
Newegg should be aware of this if they are going to use Bitpay.
Bitcoin is affiliated with neither company.

they have statistics for this...
unemployment rate for college grads is half that of high school grads. they also have a higher income (on average) by multiple thousands. definitely worth it.

wtfff? this is so crazy
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:37:03
if bcrash is the original version, why is it the fork? ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:37
price of bitcoin &gt; r/bitcoin subscribers
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:41:44
$1 soon honestly
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:16:43
ONE TIME bitcoin went all the way up to $3
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:00:50
nope college is definitely here to stay ��
if people can barely get a stable job coming out of high school in the US, they are going to choose college.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:14:33
i've seen so much FUD saying that the rise of alts will kill bitcoin haha
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:33:40
use gdax, they have wire transfer from their exchange
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:18
actually yes please fill me in, lol the last time i heard about it everyone was hating on it. and wait when did it happen?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:44:07
ok yeah you are right. lol...i need to think more before i say dumb stuff hah
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:16:03
binance has a good variety
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:33:29
yeah there is only finite bitcoin. if have 1 bitcoin you will have that amount until you sell.
this is mostly just the law of supply and demand. if someone wants to buy bitcoin but all the bitcoins are owned, the price goes up. the price goes up until someone sees it worth their money to sell. so the price will adjust to create market equilibrium.
i only know very basic economics so someone please correct me if i'm wrong!
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:48:19
so uhhh...why can't we store them in an echange like coinbase? i have heard this many times but i am still confused. doesn't coinbase have enough money to insure all of it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:46
anyone remember 24 hours ago when Bitcoin was $12,000? Seems like eons ago.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:43:32
i think they set up their own "replay protection" that involves freezing all transfers and transactions around the time of the fork
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:16:48
"yeah can you guys just put it in this room? thanks"

@_date: 2017-11-27 01:16:15
yeah, but use gdax instead of coinbase. coinbase basically slaughters you with fees unless you buy over around $300 (the fee for $5 is the same as the fee for $300 i think)
edit: and i believe gdax has no fees/minimal fees. someone correct me if i'm wrong
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:00:06
i think paypal and venmo are pretty easy to use...no fees compared to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:59:16
coinbase freezes the price at the time you press buy, and that is the price it will cost you when the payment processes. lucky you :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:06:54
cool clickbait haha amirite?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:54:12
psst (i think it was a joke)
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:34:04
there are $0 fees if sent through friends and family.
just today i paid $4 to stick some bitcoin into a wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:18:28
hey, uhhh, so like when is the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:35:40
thats the thing i would expect a hodler to do
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:33:07
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:33:18
we can use his statements to predict bitcoin prices now
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:31:32
lick me if im wrong, but i dont think coinbase supports the forkcoin anyway
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:42:17
$5 million is unreasonable. lots of people say it will crash, but it has no reason to. i would guess it grows (relatively) steadily to 10k.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:22:08
they said the same thing about $5000. look what happened.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:07:45
