I see a tall dark stranger, and you taking a foreign holiday..

Crap, I thought you were Dodger Ver. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:35:08
Ah.  Now that was a question.  I don't know.  Ask the OP.

I'm not invested in it, but I love it because it is complementary to real BTC and is displacing the dishonest BCash.  (Now 4th in cap, and 6th in trading - yay!)

I use 2 x paper (24 word seeds), 2 x USB 256 Military standard secure USBs.  Paired in 2 locations,  For added security I use a '25th' word, based upon something written down elsewhere that I will never forget.  Main wallet is a Trezor with a PIN.  (Multiple PIN attempts extend the times allowed between PIN attempts.)  I have reminders and hints of all this information in a low security document in my Gmail.  Even if my Gmail were hacked, it would be of little help.  I'd rather risk that, than forgetting what the hell I had done!

If history is repeating itself, shill, it will keep going up.  Heh!

Shakespeare invented the metaphor probably, with his 'bubble reputation':
Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, 
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation.
He also invented the term: Shitcoine Cashe, for 'dishoneste coins of the realm' in his play: Roger de Vere and his fireworks Pt III.

Sorry mate - I misread.  Which coin are you referring to?  In your new wallet, just copy and check your receiving address, and send to that from your exchange.  I double check the first and last 2 or 3 digits.  Why are you worrying about these technical issues?  If you want to move the coins, just do that.  The blockchain should ensure you have what you are owed.

I can't think of ANY reason wherein I would give out my seed phrase - even to a trusted person - never mind on the internet.

You should write a really long boring novel that nobody reads, instead of an anguished meaningless monologue that nobody reads - both will pay you zero.
