This is some great evidence that Dorian is not the BTC Satoshi, but we still don't know who the person is behind this account. Yes the user name is Satoshi Nakamoto, but it could have been Dorian who owns that account.
I know it is far fetched, but there is still a tiny bit of doubt that can be placed.

The ATM probably has a high spread to cover operating cost, so buying from there will be more expensive than an exchange.
On a slightly unrelated note where is this ATM? I'm currently in the Seattle area and would like to check it out.

I've heard conflicting reports of what will happen after the March decision.
Some have said if the SEC makes no decision it gets auto-approved since this is the final hearing.
Others say if the SEC makes no decision it gets auto-denied.
Does anyone which is it?

I'm not totally up to date on the BU vs Core debate but can someone tell me how increasing the block size and giving miners consensus on future block size would result in centralising and PayPal 2.0?

Thanks for the quick response. There is no CPFP option but there is an "Increase fee" option. I tried it an hour ago and nothing happened.
I will post this on for more info

I've had a transaction that has 0 confirmations for the last couple hours. I attached the normal fee that the Electrum wallet applies (18.2/sat per byte) but transaction isn't getting picked up. Is there anything I can do? Can I cancel it? It the mempool really backed up right now?
Edit: It appears the mempool unconfirmed count spiked right before I send my transaction out which is probably why it won't move forward
