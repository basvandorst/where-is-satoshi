I like that crpyto currency is being adopted, but can we stop trying to make Bitcoin work? I think really it is getting in the way of actual mass adoption, with these high fees and long wait times. It's leaving a bad tase in people's mouths and now crypto is leaving a bad taste in people's mouths. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:17:29
Why....bad publicity is still publicity. Bitcoin is getting lots of attention and if you think it's not connected to the increase in bitcoins price in 17' then you are wrong. I could care less. Crypto is not going away.

People put together some extreme comparison's. C'mon man. Really? BTC to gravity and the discovery of the earth being round?  BTC has yet to revolutionize anything. Its been supposedly one of the biggest redistributions of wealth in a long time. So there's that. That's about it. Im not saying in 20years it wont be a game changer. It just hasnt done much yet. (On with the downvoting, for the record i love BTC, im just being a realist about it all)

I don't see another stretch like that, and it's because all the other attention crypto is getting now. I'm not saying Bitcoin can't or won't dip that low, it's possible especially if other coins take the spotlight. IMO it'll toter in the 12k -17k for a while. It would rise sooner but with gdax adding a few alt coins, and the amount of development 18' will see for alt coins  Bitcoin will struggle to build solid upward momentum for the next 2 -3 months, I hope im  wrong, cause I'm holding ATM.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:33:53
It looks like my prediction was a little bit off it only dip down to about 3.40 before it shot back up. Iota has been surprising me lately and I'm disappointed that bitfinex close the doors to us customers does anybody have a way around that yet?

yuppers. i predicted 19k over the weekend. and i figured 25k by christmas time, lets see if im right. :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:50:39
1st off why are you doing any trading using coinbase? Gdax would be the obvious option to do your trading. 2nd I've heard good things about gemini. Personally I'll be looking for alt.coin.io exchange when it opens up. Supposed to have a bunch of coins, good secuirty, made by day traders for day traders. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:52:52
Agreed for the sake of my choice of word, but Doubtful. Bit coin has shown stability as a investment market the latter half of 2017. It's going to mature. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:45:45
Wait till this huge fomo alt coins situation levels out.  It's been stable which means everyone is keeping theirs eyes on bitcoin. I'll bet this this weekend we see it break 19k
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:53:15
thing is, we all know the growth is becoming more exponential as time passes. the dips will happen, but they may be short lived dips, and the spikes may occur to the likes which we have yet to see. There will only be 16 millions coins total. The demand is increasing by the day. Bitcoin is going to explode sometime in 2018 and reach 6 figures.

I feel like bit coin will turn into a circus freakshow at some point with a ridiculous high value, and fluxuations so drastic that people will lose all faith in it and shift to altcoins completely. I guess this is my vision of bitcoins eventual death. Years away though

@_date: 2017-12-16 18:08:32
Even after its bubble it won't crash. It'll shrink into a  level market cap and people will still invest in it but it won't be the big thing. It'll be a dead coin to most but It'll still be higher in value that a lot of other coins. Bit coin won't hit 0. It won't fall to 1 over night. People have such unrealistic ideas of what will happen. The bubble (IMO) won't happen until it gets to .5mil or multi million. I think it'll happen on a day were the price goes up so high in one day, that it creates massive swings of buys and sells and it'll be a circus to the likes of which we haven't seen. It's volatility will get so great that the coin basically explodes.......that's when alt coins see a tidal wave of influx from investors and the whole game changes. 2019, 2020. Just my guess. It's wild but it's what I see happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:34:12
That does seem crazy. I know. I don't think people thought would get this far. Total market cap isn't a real number anyhow. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:39:57
You know I figured the next push, when it happens we see 25k. I'm thinking that we see it before christmas. I'm surprised that bit coin has been as stable as it has after hitting 17/18k. People claim bubble but not yet. The bubble may happen, but we're not in one as of right now. Just an influx in investors. You can look at all coin's total market cap increase and see the influx pour in over Oct, Nov and Dec. I'll bet this fomo allt coins situation sees a correction and that correction is what shifts money back to bitcoin. We'll see
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:46:05

WALL STREET cares about one thing. And Well this is a Bitcoin thread and anyone who reads up on blockchain tech should know that Bitcoin fails in comparison to many of these newer alt coins (from a tech standpoint) For me Bitcoin( not every coin, just BTC) is an investment, that's it. A way to make money. I think that's where most people's heads are at especially since Wall Street stepped into the picture and is putting a mega spotlight on the pricetag. Hell, Bitcoin futures became a thing. People bet on the price. That's all it is betting on the price of Bitcoin.

Hold, your at 825,000 roughly. Go for millionaire status. Worst case bit coin dips back down to like 12,000 for a while. But I have a strong feeling bit coin will hit 100k in the next 10 years and it'll be a fucking circus, with 20k, price swings perday. Agh. I would start gradually diversifying my portfolio and sell off bitcoin when it hits highs. 5 bit coin or so at a time, and reinvest it in alt coins. But do your research. Good for you OP

Look at my history. I've been saying for about 3 weeks now that we will see resistance at 7.5 k in this 3 rd dip. Look at the 6month candlestick graph. 1st dip, 5.9k. 2nd dip 6.5k. 3rd dip 7.5k? It'll level out in the 8k region and come Q3.....................…buuuuuulllllllll rrrruuuuuuunnnnn. When we break the 12k resistance level we are in for a treat my friend. My guest is July August. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:17:29
In theory several other coins accomplish what bitcoin is doing but faster, and cheaper. If i name names youll try and start an argument. Will you not? You could make a case about some of them being more decentralized which i wont argue that because some of them are.

We should see resistance levels around 7.5k or in that area. Maybe it goes to 7.2 or 7.3. dont worry folks, this is last dip, itll flatten out in the 8k region and in june we will actually finally see the start of a bull run like we did at the end of 2016. Its almost here!!!!!! ������

@_date: 2018-05-27 01:23:54
Well i think Ethereum does what bitcoindoes but a bit better. Stellar may prove to be great but you could make a case about it being less decentralized. Theres a couple others but i havent read up on them enough to make great talking points. Btc, xlm, and eth are the ones i like the most. ��
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:07:47
You really think it's going to zero. Think about that. That would mean that every single person that owns Bitcoin would have to sell. There are lost Bitcoin. It'll never hit 0 0 0. This pattern that we're seeing in Bitcoin right now has been played out before. This exact pattern has already been lived out in the crypto World many many times. Look at a 6-month candle graph Or a 1-year candle graph quit looking at a 15 minute

Oh you mean that thing that spits out paper fiat that you need a bank account to use? 
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:18:00
Crypto is not like any other type of investment. I think that's fair to say. And on top of that just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean that it isn't possible or that it wont. (Not trying to argue) i usually base my opinions of graphs and some technical analysis, which some people could care less for all together.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:10:22
And they will. I think we're at the 3rd dip floor for the most part. My time line is usually off, so lately i aim for a longer timed guess. Such as maybe beginning of Q3 things really become evident of taking off and all these whiner's can go quiet.��

This is what I've been saying for three weeks. Finally hearing someone agree with me. Thank you!!!!   This graph is inaccurate though. The first dip didn't stay higher than the 2nd dip. First btc dip 5900, 2nd 6500, 3rd 7.5 -8000. Just sayin
@_date: 2018-05-17 00:23:17
Well how much data is there really to support anyone's predictions? I don't do technical analysis graphs. But I think there are people that agree with me. The first major dip hit a low of 5900. The second major dip hit a low of 6500. If you look at a six-month candlestick graph the trend that I'm looking at is showing the third dip may be showing resistance at between 7.5 and 8000. just my guess. Dont bet your life savings on it. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:30:36
I feel like they could've made the numbers bigger to fit across the word bitcoin (like cent) but got rid of the zeros. Not sure. You're right. Wtf
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:36:38
Well I always tell peeps of mine to shove $500-1000 in crypto and forget about it. If you have luck with other passive investments then good luck on those. If you pick any coins, go with bitcoin or ethereum. Sure things if could claim such a stance in this space. :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:51:47
This made me chuckle. When the price isnt doing much......bring on the memes. Fuck it, its Bitcoin pizza day. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:21:05
Not bad speculation. I agree with most all of it, especially the big dogs selling. Were not seeing it. To me the 12k threshold is what we need to break. My timing has been off but my latest price predictions seem to be close. I anticipate a bull run forming after we pull out this dip. Price should settle in the 8k region and maybe in july or august we break the 12k mark finally. This whole year has been a year of Crash and Recovery.

That will be a great competition. But it doesnt mean both cant succeed to some level. Stellar network will also use the lightening network (Q4 2018). Its a race. Stellar's fees might be lower, it has an IBM backing which people will trust to use more although btc is more decentralized. Well see what happens. I support both

@_date: 2018-05-23 23:02:06
It hilarious that NOW people are thinking ok it is a bear market. Lol. This is the end. Nothing indicates a contined downward trend if this stays above $7500 or so, which it will. I bet ��
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:05:47
I have a nano. Xlm is the only coin i refuse to sell. I believe in it too. Ltc is gonna phase out. Xmr is great but it wont blow up like xlm will. Love what icon may do but it wont take off for a while. Good convo man. Its nice to have like minds supporting the same decison making. It confirms we are doing the right thing. I also like Ethereum and OmiseGo. (Vechain looks promising)
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:56:10
End of last year? So did i, but i reinvested..... prematurely unfortunately. This should all level out over the next 2 months in the 8k region.

I didn't make fun of him. And I don't think he took it that way either.

My point was his stance is that crypto is too risky. Same with his position on tech stocks. That's all.

It is temporary. Give it a month we will be in a sea of green fellows (and gals)

The psychology of candlestick graphs for one. The research involved in understanding the tech, looking at graphs and knowing the movement direction (this may come more easy to others than some), news (keeping up on it). There are many things incorporated into what inmean by "studying". Studying might be the best word tonuse
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:53:36
Might be true? 40% dip incoming? You guys are the type that say anything could happen at anytime. Bet money says we see resistance levels at 7.5k at the lowest, then we level out in the 8k region for a little bit.

@_date: 2018-05-16 19:36:18
Yeah just buy low. Before you buy at anytime always look at  the 15-minute, one hour 1 day six month candlesticks all of them. This will help you decide whether you should wait a day or two or Buy in right then. Everybody seems to have this sense of urgency to get in right when they can but then we go through these long drought periods Where everything is in the red.

@_date: 2018-05-27 15:00:31
Maybe I should invest more time in understanding the protocol, code, and inner workings of the Blockchain tech. My understanding is still rudimentory at best. I read about the btc smart contracts on a side chain. I also heard someone say its been a possibility for years now. Hey at least i dont hate on btc like many people do. Im invested. In fact anyone who isnt is missing out. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:12:33
There are several factors to consider. 20xmore people want to invest and make money off Bitcoin now. If you want to compare it to past trends I could respect that reasoning. But just stating that it was at $600 20 months ago is not enough anything to convince anyone who invests in these markets that you could be right. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:45:14

@_date: 2018-05-29 13:13:58
Any watch data dash? the dates dont perfectly line up. Do they? I dont think this dip will hold until june 6th. The first point is just kind of making it work. What the lowest price on apr 6th vs during that dip?........anywho i dont think anyone would try to make it so obvious. It is interesting though. Finally a post that clearly shows how the bear market will flatten out leading into the bull run. Thanks!!�� Show this to the naysayers!

The tech failing sure. But its really more of an investment vehicle. That alone will keep the price up.

You know im not 100%, this is just my take. Caoinbase/gdax is my fiat on ramp, i make 1 trade and xfer all my funds out. When they send my info over itll only have 1 trade per fiat deposit. (For the most part) i have no control over what they do. Just how i conduct myself. I dont like it anymore than you do. (I at least hope we see new erc-20 tokens, but with the security ruling in the future, i wonder if coinbase still plans on adding anything)

Ah, the no one knows whats happening next crowd. Get into technical analysis. Study the psychology of candlestick graphs. Youll realize the price of bitcoin is seeing lots of resistance at its current level, wont fall below 6.5k (probably ever again) and will level out in the 8k region sometime in june. Q3 is the start of the formation of the bull run. Please stopnspreading pandemonium. �� No offense.

I did read it. Pal. It affects my area. Southwestern part of the U.S. these Kroger's go by different names. Fry's grocery to name one. So it does affect Kroger. Hence my legitimate question, "did you read the article?" If you notice his previous comment as well, he doesn't realize it doesn't go into effect until april 3rd, stating he used his Visa today. It was a rhetorical question btw. He obviously didnt read it. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:25:49
At the point of no electricity, yeah i agree. Things of monetary value and an agreed upon physical token like silver. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 03:04:05
To be fair, they said they would have a conversation. I dont think any plans are in motion. They may just use LN as leverage to work a better credit card charge rate out with Visa. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 02:54:47
Well the Frys in my area (owned by Kroger) stated they were not accepting Visa anymore. I found out before this article was posted. Im not trying to say all Kroger, im was trying say that some Kroger. Maybe by using the word Kroger you thought i implied all Kroger. I do know that Frys operate on the west side. Dont think any are on the East. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:15:46

Chances are it will continue to rise overtime with occasional dips. Reading up on Crypto news is a def if you are investing. Bitcoin has proven itself although somewhat volatile still, that it isn't going to be worthless overnight. Too many people believe in it. The worst dip in recent history was like $8-1000 in july.

@_date: 2019-06-27 22:13:00
Yea, a major one too. I think this is the first major taste of things to come. 20% will be standard. While we've seen this before, i was a little surprised to see 20% with so much momentum.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:26:56
I dont recall seeing anything have a 40% dip in a 24 hr period. But ive only been around since 2017. 30% Maybe for some alt coins that hit 100% gains in a 2 day period.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:18:19
I would not bet on it hitting 9k. Itll probably pull up into the 11-12k area and stablize. And yes even a 5-10% retrace could be a dip. Especially in the stock market
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:04:38
Were you expecting to see mad gains? Im wondering what would warrant this type of post OP. Im not shocked at all by the movement of crypto at the moment. It'll take many months before we get back to the previous ath, imo. Everyone seems to out their timestamp on it, but no one knows for sure. Things will move sideways for a few months before trending upwards. That's my Outlook. Of you're not currently projecting an entry point or buying and selling. Just look away and check in periodically. (And yes most people have money in it, to make money, not to use it in place of fiat)

We are up (what is that in percentage???) 500%? (roughly) is that right? 2018 is going to be very interesting. i think we see some INSANE values next year for many coins. im looking at you Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bcash, and Monero too.

At least USD is a more stable currency and has mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:33:47
Well digital currency does seem to be the way moving forward. So the current fiat system has been being changed prior to crypto currency entering the picture. I imagine whether BTC is successful or not it will help shape the future of digital currency on a global level in some way. Its far too early to tell.

Hodl. Sell it as you need it. When we see new aths sell on the way up
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:46:46
i figure our lowest point moving forward will stay above $1153. and chances are a good percentage above that. since i haven't much more money top throw at this sort of investment i hope BTC stays above $4000, but i wouldnt' be surprised if we test the $3500 range. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:45:48
Well in theory a bull run would come eventually and we all hope its around the next corner. So many hopes broken. Lol. I sure didnt expect it to hit dip this low but my TA sucks

I can't argue with this. Of course 2x coins, 2xmoney. Your example with 2 coins sees a bigger percentage increase though. A better approach would be to find a coin that isn't already valued at 4000. Maybe a coin valued at  1 or 50. Omg is looking solid.

Yup.....And hit $4200 on some exchanges. There is an overwhelming concern. You see now things get real and the facade falls away......maybe the markets will continue to bleed and it wont all work out like i was banking on. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:22:33
Will anyone know what that means? (Besides us of course)
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:40:46
But if you invest 4400 and it goes up 10% you have 4840 either way. No?
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:58:25
You could wish for $2200 bitcoin. But fact of the matter is, a $5000 investment with an increase of (example) 23% is still 23% up on 5k whether you buy at $2200 or buy at $4250. Why wish the market plummet? If anything the continued volatility will take longer to recover then a continued growth

OmiseGo will tackle this in a much better way. Unfortunately Bit coin is creating new centralized authorities. Exchanges.

Speculation 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:54:58
Good return investments are usually pretty risky
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:08:19
Whatever 8.99 is in bitcoin atm. would be an example.

Hopefully some of us take the time to read and understand instead of pushing around a bunch hot air and misinformation 
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:10:15
This is in reference to the November fork yeah?
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:32:47
It can't be regulated internationally. Haha (devilish laugh)
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:53:42
I would do it, but not bitcoin. Yes it's risky, so is nearly every investment. Long term, odds are looking good for you. If you keep tabs on the price and inform yourself of more coins then you can move the monies around and not worry too much about things tanking for 2 years like last time
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:46:19
What? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:16:34
Aside from being a financial investment what is the practicality of bitcoins use? Peer to peer transfer of funds? Every coin does that. A payment system? Its slow and has high fees at times. I imagine bitcoin will evolve as it has been but I don't see much current use for it aside from the investment side. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:59:52
Time will tell I guess
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:13:28
A confirmation occurs sooner. It just confirms that the money/coin  will be sent. This doesn't take too long from what I remember, but now a days I'm not sure. The actual xfer can take hours.

I feel like amazon is more likely to develop their own block chain entirely.

Def disbelief
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:41:28
Maybe wait a week or 2. The price could flirt with $6.5 -7k. Not saying it will, but the shake down may not be over.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:39:48
Descending triangle flag pattern. Same exact situation when BTC dropped from $6500 to $3200. Many people saw this coming. Don't worry itll rebound. More chance to accumulate honestly. Nothing to be too concerned about.
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:17:55
Like 13k dirty.

Ouch. Bitcoin is worthless these days.

@_date: 2019-09-12 15:22:25
Which is the way it should be.
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:36:14
Very conservative. What was the 2013/4 ath $1k, $1300? 2017 ath, $19,500. Near 20x. Im not saying itll hit $350k, but dont try and predict the bear market with a move such as selling at anything less than 6 digits.
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:56:52
According to the block chain folio app, it showed October November of 17' pulling out from the $3k range and not stopping until it reached the ATH of 19+k. I dont recall if thats true but i remember things falling dramatically during the entire bull run at some point. Think it was after Eth hit $400 and Bitcoin surpassed 5k. Serious rebound. So we saw a great bull formation thus far in 2019. We will encounter dips, bad ones. Expect them. Like 25% reversals, but they'll come after 50-150% gains across the board. I personally dont have an opinion on how high it will go other than higher than the recent ATH by a significant margin. 2-3x at least. (I wouldn't want to be banking on it hitting 200k and hodl 2 months into the next bear market cause i was so sure)
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:11:06
Incoming $3240
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:08:32
You mean to say hands up if you sold before the correction and had a buy order waiting so you could increase your stack. Why do so many people just hodl? Are we afraid of screwing up and losing part of our stack?
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:30:15
$5k usd is a stretch

Crypto now has global media attention where it did not pre "the bubble". End of 2017 moving forward. So none of those folks have been around to see it surpass the previous ATH.
