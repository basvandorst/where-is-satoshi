Im not spending an additional 15 bucks on a 45 mouse just because "Bitcoin is the future" This is not how you make bitcoin mainstream.

Geocities closed permanently in 2009. You would have to be born pre-2000 for you to know what geocities for the most part. Anyone born in the early 2000s, myspace is the "old computer joke" goto because thats all we know.

Why don't I save in Fiat? I mean, its a lot easier and a LOT more stable...

Never heard of that. Sounds cool. Although it still seems like kind of a bodge. The fees and proprietary wallet seem kind of anti-bitcoin in a way.

Fair enough. I'm still thinking from a consumer POV rather than a enthusiast POV.

@_date: 2017-08-14 00:06:56
And people complain about people not adopting BTC enough...

lol, sorry, it's just funny to me that a game made in a certain art style has become known as that entirety of that art style.

I saw this on snapchat and it really worried me. The bitcoin transactions Ive done have processed within a minute, and If I recall correctly, bitcoin is secure, but the host providing bitcoin services got hacked. I think its things like these why bitcoin wont catch on. The "gimmick" of it being massively more convenient, secure, and safe seems to be too different and complicated for many people and they would rather just stick to regulae banks and credit cards. Anyone see any other bad information about bitcoin in the news?

Thanks for the clarification ��

I must be missing something. I am a BTC noob, but isn't the whitepaper what defines bitcoin? Doesn't the fact that it states that mining power=voting power make that so? I'm not saying I'm a fan of this idea but how can the fact of the way bitcoin works be disputed? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:06:46
ok I gotta say I don't think is right all the time, but you when satoshi made something like this so clear you can't really dispute it.
