If speculating in cryptocurrencies -only "invest" what you're 100% ok with losing.  If you understand that next year it could possibly be worth less than today - go ahead and buy some!

If Bitcoin is "the new Gold" as some suggest, a stock market correction could create a situation in which a lot of that money gets moved into cryptocurrencies...

In America, people can rollover or transfer retirement funds from a 401k or other retirement account and into a "bitcoin IRA."

There will always be haves and have-nots. Bitcoin has no barriers, anyone with a laptop, cell phone, or internet connection can find a way to start buying, using/receiving bitcoin.  As you said - even if just a small amount.  Cryptocurrencies offer possibilities that knock down some of the barriers that have kept the poor unable to invest and participate... but yes, there will always be those with and those without.  That's life.  Put your own oxygen mask on first - start buying some bitcoin... then focus on educating those around you to learn more and maybe buy (only buy what one can afford to lose).

There are interweb rumors that Ripple or Monero will be picked up by GDAX/Coinbase soon - if so, a lot of money will start pumping into these coins... But who knows. Only speculate with money you're ok with losing.
You're making a $50,000 bet - go to Vegas and put it all on black!  It won't take a year to find out!  Your odds may be a little better in Vegas too!

Most financial advisors at this time will probably advise against cryptocurrencies - especially with retirement funds - as this is the biggest disruptor the financial industry has ever seen... and in their defense - is still too unpredictable an asset to gamble your nest egg. Some forward thinking financial advisors may be ok with a small percentage of 401k/ IRA funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets, but nothing significant. Will we see $100,000 bitcoin? The next several years will be interesting.

Ok, there are a few "Bitcoin IRA" companies out there. They do NOT all handle cryptocurrency IRAs the same way. Some questions to ask:
1.) What cryptocurrencies can they work with?  As of right now, I believe the only cryptos that can be held in an IRA are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ripple, and Litecoin. Not familiar with some of the other larger cryptos? 
Check out 
...Sorry, you can't invest retirement funds into Potcoin! :)
2.) What are their fees/charges? 
Do they charge to setup your account? What premium are you paying for your cryptocurrencies? What is the annual charge for admin/storage? In other words, how does the bitcoin IRA dealer profit?  Get all fees in WRITING.
3.) How does the company STORE your cryptos? 
Vault storage? Who do they work with?  Some companies do so much volume, that they work out great deals with custodians and pass those savings to you.
Side note: In recent years, companies that specialize in self-directed IRAs have been selling the "home storage" IRAs...  For example, there is appeal in the "home storage Gold IRA," as people want to hold their precious metals at home, but also take advantages of an IRA's tax benefits.  Likely this will be offered with bitcoin IRAs also. The company will help set up an LLC in your name, and have the LLC hold the gold (or bitcoin).  Do NOT try to fool the IRS - You are not a qualified fiduciary for a "company." I'm not a lawyer, but a quick google search pulls legal advice telling you to stay away from the home storage IRA...
4.) Offline or Online Wallet?
Only work with a Bitcoin IRA dealer that holds your cryptocurrency in an offline wallet - COLD STORAGE. The only way for your bitcoins and other investments to stay 100% safe from hackers is cold storage.  If your bitcoin ira company does NOT offer this - do NOT go forward.  
At the time I'm typing this, the price of Bitcoin is hovering just below $20,000. There are professional hackers committed to break into these online exchanges/wallets. Regardless of the amazing security of your online wallet - you want your Bitcoin IRA to be offline/secure at all times.  COLD STORAGE or No business.
5.) Reputation of the company?
How long have they been in business? While Bitcoin IRAs may be new, what other financial services do they provide? What do you find on the BBB, TrustLink, and other INDEPENDENT review sites? 
6.) Is a bitcoin IRA the best investment vehicle for you?  There are a growing number of options for people that want to invest in bitcoin. Just now saw this twitter poll - There's Coinbase, $GBTC, Self-Directed IRA, now there's even an Index Fund that tracks the top 10 cryptos (although only open to accredited investors). You can now trade Bitcoin futures, and this year will likely bring the crypto ETF.  Do your due diligence.
7.) Get on the PHONE with a few of these companies and ask for more info. It's easy to check out a few sites, but getting on the phone with people gives you a lot more information - how do they conduct themselves? Are they professional? Are they too salesy? Or actually trying to help you make an informed financial decision?
I'm listing the first few companies that popped up on google - I am not endorsing any of these... In fact I'm pretty sure at least one of these dealers does not offer cold storage?  but do your homework yourself! Good luck :)
