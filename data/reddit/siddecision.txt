The issue is when we as users scream we want more regulation in our crypto and more safety nets against exchanges, we invite more government control (to get that FDIC insurance you can bet they had to submit client data to the Feds) to the point where we may as well be dealing with bankers.

hmmm some enlightening math

I thought I read this already and the bill actually said that they wanted to require ID to use fiat to buy cryptocurrency, not trade crypto. Isn't that a requirement already for most fiat on ramp exchanges?

What are Gemini's fees? I've never visited their site

I believe they don't provide you with a document unless you have a certain number of trades you've performed or a certain amount of crypto you have traded. I don't know the specific amounts.

I know this guy claims otherwise but its more likely he got phished. I've never had an issue with Kraken's 2FA but then I also take a little extra care with random links I find on the internet.

I think you can short it on Kraken, no? And I know Bitmex lets you do futures on it.

Steam should honestly bring bitcoin back since the entire reason for removing it was the insane volatility from last year and the bull run.

And this is why I use Kraken and did use Coinbase. You don't see those guys getting hacked
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:27:10
No the truth is being obfuscated. There is a serious weakness in their security and the claim about a phishing attack is to distract from that.

I bet you anything it has to do with Binance's 2FA on their phone. Saw a post about someone discovering the Binance phone app being linked to a 2fa bug and then Kraken comes out with a blog post about how 2FA on phones can be bypassed.

I use Bitmex as well. Easy to get into and use especially if you hide behind a VPN.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:36:58
There are a bunch that have never been hacked: Coinbase and Kraken are two.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:23:22
HA! I can attest to the Bitmex rekt part.

You do know that those volumes are manipulated as all hell right? I don't know why they keep getting listed as metrics of anything. But seriously as I stated above, I think an older established exchange could be easily valued at a few billion even in a bear market, its the newer exchanges that I could agree with you on that aren't worth anything as there is no guarantee they will actually survive the bear market.

Many exchanges were raking in way more than 90 million back during the bullrun, hence why there was an explosion of exchanges. Since the run extended into 2018 for a bit its where they are most likely getting their valuation. If you think Bitcoin can once again reach 18,000 or another bullrun is possible,  I don't see why you wouldn't value an exchange at a few billion.

Its nice!

Not so much Google Authenticator being compromised, but the 2fa input for the Binance app. I'll look for the post but someone reported finding a bug when inputting 2fa on the Binance phone app. Of course most security experts don't like Google Authentication either, I use a yubikey for 2fa after an IT guy recommended it to me.

I don't think we're out of bear market yet. The dark age may continue.

Weiss rating team is saying nice things about Ver? did I wake up in an alternate timeline?

Binance is wash trading?
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:21:28
Did the company put that on? it reads almost like the ATM itself is part of the scam. 
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:11:01
Hold on hitting up Bitmex, now.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:11:25
If you are in Europe the rates for onramping and off ramping from Kraken are good. Plus their liquidity for Euro pairs is better than most, just no GBP. Coinbase has the best UI if you don't mind the fees. Binance is the biggest though if you don't care that they recently got hacked.

I wonder why there isn't a seasoned Sell pic for the guy thats been shorting crypto.
