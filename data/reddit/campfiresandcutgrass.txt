Yeah so it can give another opportunity for BCash to copy the code that core devs wrote to then promote BCash as the better or ‘real bitcoin’ because that’s what he’s really referring to when he says ‘bitcoin’ in the tweet.

Ummm. This was amazing! And hilarious!

Meanwhile, he’s buying all the bitcoin.

How ridiculous is it that Roger has no comment after all of this. He should be the one sending Andreas some coin even for his disrespectful comments.

Ok career.. bankers... idk about “helping” people in this case. They’re the main reason why cryptocurrencies are even here for us to participate in!
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:32:15
Hardware wallets like the ledgers allow you to choose but the savings isn’t really that much... Maybe if you’re accumulating only transfer once the fee isn’t such a hit... Like 5% or something. Sorry if it doesn’t help much.

Why? Like why is the rise of crypto keeping these guys up? They already have their families taken care of. They still have their business from the majority (for now)... so what about it is keeping these guys up?
What keeps me up at night? IDK family, health concerns, a job to keep my home? Overall family, health, and providing for those I care about to at least the bare minimum. 
Are bankers worried they can only buy Outlet designer bags vs $10K Luis Vuitton’s?

Exactly... it’s like being in the top 1% (which if he is a head of a bank or is high up in the chain to be ‘speaking’ on television or in front of an audience) isn’t enough. Oh right. He only wants to have him and his family and friends up there enjoying the golf club. Because if there’s less of a middle class, who will serve them?

Is this the one that copied the tezos white paper?

We have breadwallet, loaf, and .... (eth... coming soon maybe?!?)

My ledger just shipped! Waiting now!
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:10:22
Agreed. It's just a funny thing that as I actually get the time to push this fiat to make a purchase, MOON! Maybe I should do it more often to keep the Moore's law going...
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:16:18
Exactly what I was wondering. Isn't btc bitcoin? Is this some buzzaro world we're in?
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:35:11
So if you send bitcoin to another entities wallet or whatnot, then that is a taxable event?
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:47:38
I've done bank wire a couple of times. Fast and painless. Fees totally reasonable considering it's available immediately. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:58:43
How do they know if the address you sent to was your paper or hardware wallet or your buddies wallet who bought you lunch that day?
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:11:57
Ha! I was "Just sayin" - I laughed at it all as I saw my order confirmation come in and then saw the slight dip. I'm in it for the long haul with all the other hodlers here. Cheers to the future!
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:37:27
Wait really?

Story of my life... I never have money until a Crypto is at it's high. I out in a buy today and it was at the absolute peak of 3640. Crossing fingers I can dollar cost average out the BTC I just got. I do hate staring at scrolling numbers all day trying to guess if the price will come down and just would rather just put in the buy. Sigh...
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:36:15
Ugh. Still waiting for my ledger wallet...

Wow! How would you set this up?!
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:06:14
Username spot on!
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:51:49
Exactly! I did the ACH a few times in the past and was like, WTF... 5 days later and I missed an actual low point.. While Credit card is high in fees, it can come in clutch when you absolutely have that urge to buy when you think it’s dropping mad and you can’t wire that second...

What are the most reputable companies out there for these mining shares? I can’t remember the name but I remember some people talking about one in particular on twitter being huge, customer friendly, and most importantly, NO2X.  Kicking myself for not remembering the name or saving it though to look more into. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:03:44
I thought Ver was a US citizen. Bitfinex wouldn’t let him do this. Welp...

When you’re up for early retirement, let’s see who comes to you asking you to Pickup the tab at the bar or more. Explaining, “well you have all the money now!”

Trying to keep it legit on CList / under what most are selling as I hate back and forth. But was wondering if anyone did this with crypto on clist or if there’s another service. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:26:43
Okay! I zoomed in again and I guess it’s his sweatshirt that bunched up to make it look that way! LOL! My bad!
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:28:52
BC of this, I don't feel we should be taxed on it as well. Of course, this guy would get away with something like this but we still have to do our due diligence on tracking and reporting etc etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:58:10
I didn't think it would go below the 3200 it just passed!
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:12:56
But how do you even start to manage all the Tax implications and/or factor that in each time?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:13:47
Isn’t there a chart somewhere that shows that government spending of taxes actually contributes far less than we actually think on the obvious and necessary items you mentioned? (Roads, police, fire, education) I vaguely remembered seeing something like this and thinking how wasteful our tax dollars were getting used. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:15:41
Wait, was this post removed?

Why is the man wearing a mask? I mean, let’s try harder a bit to make it seem like crypto is only for masked villains or criminals...
Edit: Zoomed in a second time and I think it’s the sweatshirt and angle of his head. Photo tricks..
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:06:26
I understand a little... But that much? Aren’t you worried about ever paying it all back? At some point, you’d have to sell your BTC to pay off the bills..
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:58:10
I didn't think it would go below the 3200 it just passed!
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:15:31
Yeah no kidding!
