the whole unlocking it thing is whack. especially with the Morse code. 
Coinbase is a stepping stone to help the idiot masses get on board. 
But without them or another company doing what they are doing, Bitcoin would never have gotten off the ground or past being an underground drug currency. Its just too hard to acquire without getting ripped off. THe mark up on Private sellers is ridiculous. Coinbase gets away with 1% because of volume. So I am grateful for that. 
Viva La BITCOIN!

I dont think so I am grabbing arbitrary Time points. I laid out a two year time span. The article grabs the price of Bitcoin at its peak, which was only there for a day or two. Hardly substantiated that Bitcoin was really worth $1200. And even if you were able to buy a $1200 bitcoin from Gox, you wouldn't have been able to move it out anyways, as they restricted movements. 
The bubble was because of the willy bot. So the only right thing to do, is to try and grab the data before Willy bot went off the rails. Hardly Arbitrary. 
If you are going to measure Bitcoin, grab the data for a solid Month. or a 6 months period, or 1 year, 2 year, 5 year lengths. It does no one any good to say, look how it fell $400 in six hours, worst performing currency of the day...

Most people dont care about bitcoin. Why use it, when they have their online banking.
But humans have a profit gene. Something in us always wants to profit in some small way or another. Thats why we go to the gas station down the street for $0.05 less per gallon gas. 
When the price does Wall Street like tricks, the profiteers see this and want to see if they can take advantage. Seems easy, buy low, sell high. Even if they buy high by accident thinking it will go up and it drops a lot. This locks them into the ride that is Bitcoin. And I think it forces short term investors to really check out the technology and realize this is something awesome. And so the awarness spreads. I think these falls are good. 
Plus the falls make others think they might have an opportunity to jump in. "I saw it $60 higher before and now is my chance."

That figure is only for Physical paper cash. I think its considered M0. M1 includes Paper and coinage plus checking accounts in banks, and that figure is closer to $25 Trillion. 
Now imagine when houses start getting injected into the Bitcoin Wealth pool. Instead of people obtaining a few thousand dollars worth in their savings, they are putting in $300,00-$1M + for each house. 
In order to put 5 Trillion dollars worth of real estate into Bitcoin, at an average of 300,000 each. It would take 16.6 Million houses. Which is a lot! The US has roughly 125 Million houses. And this is just the US alone. Imagine when other countries start doing this. China has 456 million houses. 
Also, what about cars being bought with bitcoin. Precious Metal investors who switch or just add to their portfolios. New Investors who want something simply techy. When teenagers who work want Bitcoin, and they convince their friends. I think that will be a real firestorm event in the world of Bitcoin. When new generations enter the market. But really you can start to see how 8.4 Trillion can come pretty quickly.

I gave my roommate $10 when Bitcoin was in the $200's. That $10 is now worth about $17. He still has yet to buy any on his own. 
And I'm sitting here thinking, If you would have put $1000 into it, you could have literally $1700 right now. 
But all he does is buy Star bucks coffee on the daily. (and yes, I told him about the Fold app). Just seems so mindless. And he isn't anti-bitcoin, just apathetic.

you know who loves bitcoin more than anyone?  Poor People! because when you watch $100 in your bitcoin wallet turn into $115, it feels amazing. Its like, "holy shit, my money just grew and now I have more!" 
Moderate Rich people don't give a fuck about bitcoin. They make $60k-$100k+ a year. They have big time investments like houses and boats and maybe a money manager for stocks and bonds. They dont understand the technology and most dont care to learn. darknet drug money, enough known.
So poor people who like to use coupons probably are the main demographic for this service. I think I will try it for my next Amazon purchase. Too bad too, I just bought a lamp from Amazon.

depends on what you want. If you want Bitcoin's price to go up, then you want wealth of all kinds injected into bitcoin. But in order for the price to go down, than people will exit their currency from bitcoin. 
So I think when the Chinese woke up and saw the high price, they started shorting it, and when the price did start dropping, everyone knew the crash was coming and a bank run was made on Bitcoin.

before the last halving of Litecoin, the price was below $2. $1.05 to be exact. Then people realized a halving was happening in a few months and everyone, including me jumped in and the price rocketed up to $8.65, then floored at about 2.50ish &amp; Now it sits at $3.56.
But the price jump came in the month before the actual halving.  I think the same is happening now with Bitcoin. I don't think there will be much action around the actual halving, because the market will have already done most of its moving months before. No one saves their money to buy bitcoin AFTER it halves. 
From being a long time watcher of the bitcoin charts, I say, watch the surge in the coming months, expect a small bubble to pop with a new higher floor than it is currently.

Bitcoins that are freshly mined with no transactions will fetch a premium eventually.

I dont know who is REALLY behind the making of this movie. But I could easily see the Rothschilds wanting a movie made that showed how their family saved the economy by buying when everyone, even their own countrymen were selling them out. Rothschilds really did deserve to strike it rich.  
Or at least that is what they want you to think. I heard rumors that they knew ahead of time that the allies were winning but spread rumors that Napoleon was winning. In theory causing all the investors to sell their bonds and crashing the market. But that is all just conspiracy theory I believe.

And thats when Bitcoin went from $200 to $230 and those profits got my engines spinning. Then it went to $1100 and I was in shock. 
Eventually I learned about Money creation and watched great films like "The money masters" and "the secret of OZ".

and since you can buy almost any good on amazon, its not really a question of "is it wrong to pay people in gift cards to your own company instead of their local currency". 
Then companies like Purse come up and say we will give you your local currency, but at a % because they are a business, not a charity.  And why do they do this? probably because shipping is expensive for them, and you can't pay your rent or local grocer in amazon gift cards.

bitcoin doesnt rely on any single one technology. If technology changes, so does bitcoin. Its spread so wide and vast. Its on Windows, apple, linux, androids, iphones, black berrys, 3rd world not smart phones, laptops, PCs, rasberry Pi's, 21bitcoin computers. Its on webpages and paper, and stamped into metal and burned into wood. 
If the internet were to go down, you could sit back and be relieved that no one could steal your bitcoins. And when it comes back up, you will be able to receive any sent transactions. 
Bitcoin is resilient.

Basically, Barry Silbert got ahold of a large amount of Bitcoin. And started his Trust fund. He then promised to never ever ever ever move the bitcoins out of his Trust Fund. They would stay under the firm's lock and key, then he would sell paper shares of those bitcoins(GBTC). So people could buy and own the bitcoins, but only on paper. non tech savvy folk feel better about letting him take care of the security and their money is also insured I believe. 
This creates a closed ecosystem. So even if Bitcoin crashes to $80, his bitcoin shares would still be worth $630. Because no one can make a bank run on his Trust fund. 
Its a pretty brilliant business plan.

Stupid. Grabbing data points from an arbitrary point in time. 
The Truth is, Bitcoin was at $230 before the Artificial inflation from Mt. Gox. Then when Gox went insolvent, Bitcoin gradually made its way back to $230 and is now at its current price. 
So in my opinion, Bitcoin basically took 2 years to go from $230 to todays $430.   Not to bad!

I have my Shift card and it works great. Unlike my coin card. (but now I can actually spend Bitcoin with coincard using my Shift Card through my Coin Card. lol)
But I was just thinking about something. If everyone uses the shift card, will that put downward pressure on the price of bitcoin?
Think about it. I buy lunch at chipotle. Chipotle ask for $8 from Coinbase. Coinbase gives Chipotle $8 and takes back my Bitcoin. 
So if everyone uses their shift card, Coinbase will have higher Bitcoin reserves than dollar reserves. Effectively Lowering the price of bitcoin. Until the customer buys back his bitcoin. Which is not immediate or Automatic.

No you'll have spent $4 in bitcoin for the latte.  But if you dont buy it back right away, the price of Bitcoin may go up and $4 will net you less bitcoin.

The US is not terrified of Crypto. If they were terrified, they would simply outright ban it.  Bitcoin is a gov't operation made to look like a natural grassroots movement so the public wont question it as much. 
They got to play these stupid little games. So people wont suspect the NSA of creating Bitcoin. Meanwhile, intelligent people are using all their spare cash to buy Bitcoin and a few other Cryptos up. 
My opinion: I think they are trying to get a certain percentage of Americans into Bitcoin before they approve an ETF and spike the price way up.  I feel like they are trying to guide us into a Crypto Economy. If "The Powers that Be" wanted us on a crypto economy, they could announce it and start building it tomorrow. 
But think of this: Imagine if tomorrow the Gov't says, "we are launching our official CryptoCoin. There are only 21 Million of them and they are $100k each."  All the poor people would be pissed off that they never had the opportunity to ever have 1 whole coin.  Or if they launch them at $1 each, no one would be able to get one, they would all be gone so fast. The Launch would be a giant cluster fuck.
So instead, they launched it they way Satoshi Nakamoto launched it. 
And now, its almost 10 years later and even with all the news about Bitcoin, the dull still dont get it. So its my opinion, they are manipulating the price to lure more people in for their own benefit. 
People weren't getting in, so they decided to show them the True power of Bitcoin at the end of 2017. They dumped a few billion into the market, drove the price up to $19k And then slowly dropped the price so the laggards can get on the ride. 
The price is still tripple what it was before the bull run of 2017, but we need to convince more people to join the network for their own benefit.  Cause most likely, in order to prevent an economic disaster like hyper inflation, the Gov't will use Bitcoin and other Cryptos to hide the hyper inflation and keep this Fiat thing stable and going.

Bitcoin WILL be replaced. But with that said, bitcoin can still live long into the future.  
Just because something better comes along, doesn't mean bitcoin becomes obsolete. 
Just like how better monetary tools have been invented, doesnt mean gold and silver became obsolete. They are just an alternative. Bitcoin will be that. An alternative store of value. 
Better alt coins have come along, and bitcoin has not adapted their features yet. Yet bitcoin is still here. There are already thousands of stores of value in the world and there will be thousands more stores of value created in the future.

The general public sees bitcoin swing downward $10-$15 and they freak out. Mainly because they never see that kind of swing with USD. So obviously something must be wrong with bitcoin.

Sounds like something about undermining ad revenues. 
To me the program sounds like every website could be its own mining pool. And when a person logs onto your website, their computer starts mining the network for that website.

I want an app for my phone that can help me visualize my bitcoins. 
So I would put my public address into the app and it would watch my Bitcoin address. 
If I have a partial bitcoin, the app would show a gold nugget. And the nugget would get bigger as I collected more bitcoin. Eventually when I have one whole bitcoin, it will be displayed as a shiney Gold Bitcoin. 
Maybe at &lt;.10 it would look like a pile of gold dust. By .25 it would look like a nugget. .50 it would look like a rough coin made by hand. By .75 it would look like a roman coin(uneven, not 100% round) then at 1.00 btc it would look like a minted coin. 
The app could look like a vault and display all my coins visually so I can show my friends my bitcoins. 
And I should be able to let it watch multiple addresses simultaneously. (cuz people split their coins into multiple wallets for safety. )
Also, we should be able to change the denomination to smaller units so we can have more options of visual display. Btc, mBTC, Bits, Satoshis, etc...

I make about $20/hr in Southern California. Living pretty much pay check to pay check. I've managed to save up about 6 bitcoins. 
I always give them a default value at $1000 in my head. I think they will get back up that high no problem in the future and probably higher. But thats the number I value my bitcoins at. 
With that said, being a pay check to pay check guy, I am proud of myself to have saved up close to 6 Btc. I throw $50 in on an autobuy every week. I really consider this my savings account. As my real savings account always gets siphoned off near the end of the month to pay off bills or gas or food.

I believe the reasoning behind it is that appcoins are pegged to a company or application. 
Where bitcoins can buy anything, the app coins can only be redeemed for products pegged to the company.  Its like having a coupon. Sure it knocks off 0.50 cents of the price, but that coupon can only be used on cat food.  So its great if you need catfood, but you are going to need cat food if you want to redeem value from the app coin. Really, they should just be called coupon coins.

HOlders are buying in droves to new merchants. Merchants are immediately changing out their bitcoin for fiat to the exchanges. The Exchanges ratio of bitcoin to fiat basically changes the price by driving it down. 
This is how I see an overall history of bitcoin since its explosion from $200 top $1000 til now:
So the way I see it, back in Halloween of 2013 thats when the shit hit the fan about this awesome new currency. Everyone went ape shit and bought. Price rose up to over $1000. The main problem was now everyone had some bitcoin, but no where to spend it. So some people cashed out around 1000 and bought stuff in fiat, so the extraction of fiat made it fluctuate a lil bit. 
Early 2014 businesses started setting up shop . More and more businesses set up. The prices has been slowly driving down an decline, with a couple sudden floor busts. Since businesses are using coinbase and bitstamp to buy the bitcoin immediately at the time of sale, the merchants are basically injecting bitcoin into the exchanges and taking out the fiat, driving the price down. 
The price will skyrocket when Merchants start keeping their bitcoins and using it as a unit of trade with other businesses, keeping the bitcoins out of the exchanges forcing bitcoin to be more scarce and driving the price of bitcoin up. 
Better grab as many cheap cheap bitcoins as you can right now. Things are going to get crazy in the next year. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 21:16:29
I would gladly have my change given to me in bitcoin. of course I am a pretty hard line bitcoiner and this is expected of me, but other than quarters which I use for laundry, change is meaningless to me and i throw it away more often then I spend it. 
I'll use my debit card over the $5 bill in my pocket because I don't have the extra $0.13 in change. (sand which cost $5.13).

True True. I've sold bitcoin on craigslist a handful of times. A couple times it was clean cut college guys, a couple other times, the dudes were sketchy as hell, but otherwise cool. One guy brought me a little weed on his second purchase and offered me 3D printer blue prints for guns LOL. 
The way it works with me, is I agree to an amount before we meet. And if its over $600 or 2 bitcoins I'll ask to meet in a bank. Otherwise we meet at a local starbucks. They show up and we talk for a moment, and they hand me the cash. I'll inspect the moneys and then proceed to send them the BTC. After a confirmation or so, they usually split. Done. 
But since I've started doing this I have put a lock on my phone and I never leave it on the table. Always put it in my pocket when not in use.

what I mean is they will end up having you pay them with bitcoins  with an interest rate. So you take a loan from them, you got to pay it back with interest, bitcoins or fiat. it dont matter. 
I bet they will have a clause. You must pay back a total of 6 btc or $6000 in US Currency. Whichever is greater.

If only the taxation got used appropriately. I think one of the greater justices we could do for our country is to limit the amount of money feeding the monster. They will always get our taxes through wages and big business. But when we start using bitcoin and keeping those extra 1's and 0's the gov't is going to have to make real decisions on budget cuts as the income stops over flowing in but just streams in. 
Hopefully it creates a smaller gov't by cutting shitty programs and limits frivolous spending.

alright how about this for an "appcoin" business model.
Company A wants to be a 3rd party equity holder. Basically, you send the money to this company, when you receive the goods you allow company A to release the money to the seller. 
What if Company A develops their equitycoin and premines a set amount. Lets just keep numbers simple with 100. And it backs all 100 coins with 100 million dollars. These coins now have a set value pegged against the dollar.

Its becoming apparent to me what is needed is simply a QR Code display that hooks into the legacy PoS. But have it out and next to the pin pad for debit cards.
Punch up what is owed on the old register, 
the QR code display will show a payable address with the amount from the PoS and you just scan it with your phone. 
Once the payment goes through, the receipt prints from the legacy PoS, the Bitcoins are forwarded to a wallet or an exchange to be transferred to your bank account. Done, Done and Done.

totally. But at the same time, coinbase raises 25 Million dollars. I'd have to imagine every coinbase employee(which could be 3 people for all i know) has to own some bitcoin. and those who invested the 25 million probably also own bitcoin as well.  
What about all the Bitstamp employees, and the hundreds of other small time merchants? Don't they want to hold at least a single bitcoin? I see day after day, this place accepts bitcoin, and this one too. The Fed Reserve is starting to take bitcoin into consideration. 
Republicans and other political parties are accepting bitcoins as donations. When the gov't auctioned off 30k btc, lots of incredibly rich investors all applied to bid. 
It seems as though the reach of bitcoin is spread far and wide. yet, less than a million people own any bitcoin at all. I find this so fascinatingly weird.

This is how I see an overall history of bitcoin since its explosion from $200 to $1000 til now:
So the way I see it, back in Halloween of 2013 thats when the shit hit the fan about this awesome new currency. Everyone went ape shit and bought(no significant merchants at this time). Price rose up to over $1000. The main problem was now everyone had some bitcoin, but no where to spend it. So some people with their new found wealth cashed out around 1000 and bought stuff in fiat, so the extraction of fiat made it fluctuate a lil bit.
Early 2014 businesses/merchants started setting up shop . More and more businesses set up. The price has been slowly driving down a decline, with a couple sudden floor busts. Since businesses are using coinbase and bitstamp to buy the bitcoin immediately at the time of sale and turn it into fiat, the merchants are basically injecting bitcoin into the exchanges and taking out the fiat, driving the price down. The reason why bitcoin isn't lower is because of people like myself taking advantage of cheap bitcoins at the exchanges. 
The price will skyrocket when Merchants start keeping their bitcoins and using it as a unit of trade with other businesses. Keeping the bitcoins out of the exchanges forcing bitcoin to be more scarce and driving the price of bitcoin up.
Better grab as many cheap cheap bitcoins as you can right now. Things are going to get crazy in the next year when more and more businesses accept bitcoin. haha. When everyone accepts bitcoin as payment, there will be no need to exchange it for fiat.

But as the cops crack down on buyers, the buyers evolve and make it harder for cops. For example, I could order some drugs to my apartment and have them send it under the name of a previous tennent. If the cops bust down my door, I say, "Yo, this wasn't for me officer! Look who it is addressed to!"
Now they have the burden of showing proof it was me who actually ordered it. They would need to get a warrant to comfiscate my computer and online data transactions and it might not be worth it to go after someone because they bought a gram or two of weed. 
Getting the dealers who can snitch on bigger suppliers is the name of the game. However, if they can catch a low level user easily, then hell yeah they will bust them.

Is it true that the Merchants who exchange their bitcoin sales for fiat immediately from places like coinbase and bitpay drive market price down? 
Coinbase buys and sells bitcoin. So when a person buys a good, it goes through the merchant straight into the coinbase vault. And the bitcoin to fiat ratio changes just slightly. But when the majority of the merchants are doing this, it puts a downward pressure on the price at the exchanges. 
So it seems like what needs to happen is for the merchants to hold the bitcoin and try to buy supplies they need with bitcoin. 
It appears that the price is being driven down by people spending bitcoins at merchants. Now all those people need to reup and buy more bitcoin through the exchanges. Or earn it through labor or something.

Being upset or disappointed at bitcoin in the present doesnt reflect where it will be in a year or 5 years from now.

Considering their GDP is $500 million, that is a large amount of extra money coming in. You telling me these business people in Dominica are going to turn their nose up at $35 million dollars because... bitcoin? 
come on.

The trick is to show them that bitcoin has true value pegged against the USD(or any currency) and to just get them to accept the bitcoin. But you should be asking the people you buy supplies from to accept it as well. It may be hard at first and may take a few tries. Maybe each time just ask if they are accepting "yet". I think I may have convinced a shop last night to start accepting it.

It explains your views of bitcoin and the dollars value. 
The value of the dollar was not the same as it was one or two or three years ago. 
Gold used to back Money and it varied wildly at times too. Volatility the whole reason to get off the gold standard. 
One British Bank Note (the Great British Sterling Pound) was named because it was worth its weight's worth of one pound of Sterling silver. At $20/oz and 16oz in a pound. The British Pound had $320 worth of purchasing power. Now its purchasing power is somewhere around $1.60. 
Do you see how over a long time the purchasing power of fiat money gets lessened and lessened?  It happens really slowly and instead of seeing the dollar as being worth less, you see Gas prices go up. Food Prices Go up. Remember the times when you could fill your gas tank with $20 or buy a fast food # with $5? Can't really do that stuff now a days because the dollar is worth less and less.  
Sorry if I sounded disparaging with my "you must be new".  Keep reading and keep learning about our finanical system. You'll see how absurd it all really is.

I would agree that my statement is hard to differentiate from sarcasm or seriousness in this subreddit. But I am being totally truthful. 
All the things that have happened in the last year point to green light for the American Gov't to like and accept Bitcoin without outright coming out and saying it. (thats a lot of "outs")
Just with New York Bit License wanting to regulate it versus outright try to ban/stop it. 
American politicians accepting it as political campaign donations. 
Seems like fewer and fewer Bitcoin companies are being denied banking accounts. Go talk to the Marijuana Boys in Colorado about those feels. 
The US Marshals Selling 30,000 and now 50,000. I read they didn't want to sell all 177k because they didn't want to flood the market. To me, flooding the market and lowering the value of bitcoin to a very shallow price would be a priority to an entity wanting to hurt the reputation of Bitcoin. 
Calfornia passed a bill to make CryptoCurrencies legal tender.
The sheer number of Bitcoin articles coming out of mainstream media blows my mind. As much as we would like to think, these articles would have been published anyways, There is always someone higher up handing out talking points. 
These are just a couple examples that come off the top of my mind that are all positive things that relate to Bitcoin and the American Gov't.

Bitcoin wont kill anything. Without going to apocolypto on you, bitcoin will be the thing that helps prop people up in the aftermath of financial disaster. 
2008 there was a financial disaster. My company laid off a whole bunch of people. In fact, they offered a limited number of severance packages to those who willingly quit. Too many people quit and they had to hire some people back. lol. I was a temp at the time, but I wouldn't have quit. Anyways, 2008 hit a lot of companies hard. 
How did we fix that? well we didn't. We bailed in the banks and put a bandaid over a gushing wound. It simply bought us a little more time before we have to readdress that wound.  Many think in 2017 is when the markets are going to crash again. $20 will still be worth $20, but it will probably only buy you 2 gallons of gas. 
While those who earn good money will sink lower in the middle class and live a bit leaner, Others will fall into poverty. Can't afford to buy healthy food. Hello ~~Dollar~~ value menu(they don't sell food for less than a buck anymore). See, prices slowly inflate and we hardly notice. 
What does bitcoin have to do with this? Well, lots of people think that when inflation hits the fan and causes pricing to go up. well, bitcoins value will also go up. You will need more dollars to buy the same amounts. The purchasing power of Bitcoins will increase! Plus I like the idea of Bitcoin being a deflationary asset. Hell yea I want my wealth to be worth more in a year than to be worth less. 
lol, this all makes sense in my pea brain, but I doubt its what they teach in economic schools. haha.

basically because bitcoin has scarcity. I've seen estimates of bitcoin only having 250,000 users, maybe more. But probably not over 1 million. 
What happens when 21 Million people step into the bitcoin market and they all want 1 coin. The scarcity of bitcoin is what will drive the price up. Supply/Demand. 
Just like how the price of housing goes up when there are lots of people in a small area (think Manhattan), people believe the same will happen for bitcoin. The real wealth comes when many giant corporations want to store money in bitcoin. And when that happens, the days of bitcoin volatility will be over. When bitcoin has a 100 Billion dollar cap, when someone removes tens of millions of dollars, the price will only be affected a fraction of a percent.

Actually here in the US we all go to the polls and vote. say X% voted for puppet A, and X% voted for puppet B. We then ask 2 people(college electorials) in each state to basically vote for whoever had the majority votes. But they don't have to if they don't want to. They might not have a job next time as they betray the Publics trust, but they can vote however they want.

Gimme a bitcoin hacked story please!! 
@_date: 2014-09-06 16:52:10
**I believe Newegg is totally wrong and this is why:**
My theory is this, November of 2013 Bitcoin explodes into the more mainstream. Something happened around Halloween(thats when I first heard about it) and as a whole new group of people bought the price went up. At this time, there were no significant merchants. Yes, there were a bunch, but not nearly as many as today. Most people just held onto bitcoin.
This is why I think the price reached around $1000 in December. When it did, thats when business people really started to take notice. Since January to present (about 9 months to those of you reading in the future) Merchant adoption has exploded. And Bitcoin Holders who now had a new found wealth(most who bought before Halloween and held til december)  want to spend their bitcoins. They picked one up for $100-$150-$200 and now its worth $1000. 
Now the Merchants wanting in on the action, but maybe not sure how to accept it went to bitpay and coinbase for the merchant capabilities. Long story short, I believe most merchants are liquidating their bitcoin at the time of sale, injecting the exchanges with an abundance of Bitcoin and taking the Fiat thereby driving down the price of bitcoin. 
Its just like someone paying with gold then turning to the bank and asking for dollars.  
If you guys want the price to go back up, we need to be a ~~nation~~ Nay! A World of Savers! Spend bitcoins! Spread them around! But don't spend your savings. Spend new income. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 19:57:59
it needs to be more like a trial. 
One side goes up and asks all the questions they have and take all the time they need. 
Then the other side gets to ask all the questions or give their argument in full detail using all the time they need. 
Then cross examination and keep going until everything is understood. 
This should take a very long time like a trial.  But it should allow us to get to the bottom of arguments.

maybe an address was found to be a silk road vendor and they back traced all coins that ever went into that address. Perhaps some of the coins that you purchased from coinbase eventually made its way to that cannabis dealer. They could have thought you sent your bitcoin to several addresses to "launder" them to eventually get pot. Or you sold coins and they moved from person to person and eventually someone used those coins to try and buy pot. 
just an idea of what could have happened.

I would think the merchant would ask how are you paying? Cash, credit, debit, check, Google Wallet or Bitcoin. (comically long, but... ok). If they don't accept bitcoin, then click on your bank card(inside G.W.) and approve. If they do accept bitcoin, click on the bitcoin option and approve.

Want to gamble, dont send it from your circle or coinbase wallet. Send it from an address from your desktop or mobile phone wallet. And by sending it to a different wallet, you obfuscate your identity.

I've always tried to wrap my mind around how Bitcoin isn't a pyramid scheme. Cuz it definitely feels like one. The more people who join and throw their money into the pyramid, the bigger it gets. 
But since its decentralized and no one controls it, basically you can take your money back out at anytime. 
Its like the first ethical pyramid scheme.

Its called the free market. Nothing is ever stable, the dollar just makes it feel like things are stable. 
Ever buy a car and have it fall or increase in value? Thats free market volatility. Ever buy a house and watch it fall or increase in value? That's free market volatility. Gold and Silver raise and fall in value as well. Electronics are very volatile and often drop in price too. 
As more people adopt bitcoin, it will grow in Market cap and its volatility will eventually lessen.

My argument is, he doesn't need to move them to destroy them. He just has to rip up the Keys. But what would ripping up the keys really do? It wouldn't move the market because they are out of the market. 
personally, I don't think he would trade them for fiat. The encoded message in the Genesis block shows how much he despised the current monetary system. 
I'm thinking, when it comes time to cash out, he wont need to. 
Neo: Are you telling me, I'll eventually be able to buy dollars with my bitcoins?
Morpheus: No Neo, What I'm saying is, when the time comes, you wont need to. 
So even if he bought a big house, with them, all he would be doing is distributing the bitcoins even more widely. I like to think Satoshi will be doing some anonymous philanthropy in the future.

I know there is 13 million coins in existence, thats why i used that number. But with exchanges popping up in tons of countries. With the Chinese moving the market based on their news, I thought there would be at least 13 million people combined from the US, Russia, China, Europe who would have gotten at least one whole coin.
13 million seems like a small number to me when compared to how many people have probably heard of/about bitcoin. But then again, maybe its an astronomical number.  I mean iTunes sells 21.6 million songs **a day**. I know those aren't bitcoins, but I've never even bought a song on iTunes before. lol

sometimes when the price drops a little and my bitcoin stash goes down to a weird number. Say from being worth $2000 down to $1979 because of a minor price difference. 
Sometimes I'll buy that $21 worth of bitcoin to get my stash back up to an even $2,000. 
It keeps my ocd occupied and eventually when the price upswings, that $2000 will grow exponentially. Like if the price goes back up to $1000/btc, then that $2000 in todays prices turns into $8,400ish. To the moon!

I say you got to find your own reasons. The reason I use it might not be the same you would want to use it. 
Its a transfer of value that can be sent to anyone, anywhere for practically free. 
I just loaned someone $20, it took me 5 seconds to send the money and I didn't even have to put pants on. 


Theres no reason why the vast majority needs facebook, but they still want to use it. 
Same could be said for breast milk pumps. Its a product limited to women, so half the population right off the bat can't use it. Then on top of that only post-pregnant women are going to be buying them. So that limits the market even more. My point being, don't worry about all the people who DON'T need it, focus on all the people who DO need it.

so hearing him talk about charging for information got me thinking. He said we should charge for 3D printing as an experiment. And I was thinking, that sounds good and all, but someone will just buy the printing directions and put them on a torrent. So I thought of a way to fix it.
The 3D printer will need to be hooked up to a wallet and some software.  The artist could attach instructions to bitcoin he owned. as small as a satoshi. And when someone bought the design, the bitcoin with the directions attached would be sent to the 3D printer. And the printer would then print the purchased design. (this assumes the 3D printer is at the buyers house)  the directions would be encrypted so they can't be peeled off the block chain. 
Or how about this. You attach your own public address to someone elses 3D printer, you send yourself a satoshi with the directions on it and it prints out for them. But you get to keep your directions. They'll never have taken possession of the bitcoin. Its like sliding a debit card through a card reader.

And it wasn't a bad batch. If the batch was bad, then it should have hurt all 52 children. It seems as though those 31 children had adverse effects because one size does not fit all. Penicillin is a wonderful drug, but a small percentage of the population is allergic to it.  Doesn't mean we should ban penicillin, just means we should test people for adverse effects before we go shooting everyone up with Vaccines.

incorrect. .10 of bitcoin is $24 currently. and 1 share of GBTC is $42. Huge difference. 
Its backed by bitcoin, but since he controls his supply, he can value it with as much backing as he can. I think he has 37 million backing it. which might be a reason why it starts at $37.98 share. 
The price of bitcoin does not relegate the price of GBTC. Sorry, but it doesn't.

So I think its important to have different places trying out different types of gov't. 
But if there was a one world currency that we all had a vested interest in in making sure it worked and helped the commons as much as the upper classes. Made international trade easier and faster. Then I'm all up for that. 
I mean, no single country hates gold or silver because they think its stupid. lol. Is gold the current One World Currency? One of many worldly currencies. Bitcoin can be the preferred currency of travelers.

It would be super weird if Apple integrated it before Google. Google seems more willing to try techier things like Bitcoin. But I'm sure Google was hoping to make a lot more profit without adding revenue leeching apps like Bitcoin. I think they are just gonna have to deal with the possibility of making less profits. But still, there are going to be tons of profits to be made. 
unless both companies agree to a gentlemens agreement to not accepting Bitcoin. But with Paypal, Overstock, Tigerdirect and other companies all wanting Bitcoin one of them is going to have to snap first. I know it will be Google because Apple respects the NSA too much to let a rogue foreign currency run a mockery on American made Computers. But as the Gov't silently nods its approval to Apple to let Bitcoin in. Apple may still be too snobish to let bitcoin through their system. Shit, this iPhone 6 is the first screen size change I think ever. They are stubborn. 
Anyways. You know what I want? I want a wallet that can keep track of every single item I buy. I want to be able to pull up pivot tables of what items I bought from what stores at what prices. quantities. dates of purchases. I really want to be able to analyze the data of my shopping habits. Maybe I don't realize I spend too much on frivolous things. I think a wallet like that could be really useful. Even my banks can't give me that kind of detailed information. Just a store, date and amount spent. I want line item data.

But just willy nilly injecting everyone and saying, "well, only 3000 people were hurt bad enough to receive compensation(remember, those are just the people who actually had a strong enough case to win. I'm sure others were hurt, but not compensated) so good job boys."
Its like shoving peanuts down everyones throats but luckily only a small percentage of the kids who were given peanuts died. So its okay. 
My stance is this: There needs to be better pre-testing to make sure vaccine strains won't have adverse affects on that person. If you can't provide that, then I will take my chances with chicken pox. (which I got when i was 5 and other then being a little itchy, I seem to have grown up normally.

Well, I went to Public school in Southern California. I graduated, but just barely. like by the skin of my teeth. 
Look, up until the young teenage years, it doesn't take much to teach children good fundamentals. Mostly, they just need to run around outside, socialize with other kids, go on field trips, and then spend a couple hours doing the book work. Home schooling works great for this. And for parents who cant school at home, there should be local communes. 
Then by 13-14 you can take a good look at the kid and see where they excel or what they want to pursue and go from there. Parents can then choose to take out exorbitant loans and send their kids to privatized schools. Lots of poor kids go to college now a days. 
And just because someone doesn't go to school to be a doctor, lawyer, or Upper management doesn't mean people have to work shitty jobs. Take me for example. I barely graduated HS, didn't go to college. But I have my own small business, about to open an etsy store, do consulting on the side, and I work 40hrs a week at a corporate office. 
So all in all, I think we can do better than what we got, because these public schools in the denser populated areas really suck.

I think the problem people have, is what they don't realize is once massive dumps happen by huge whales, the Whales cant just do it again and again, over and over. 
Those bitcoins will now be more evenly distributed and it will now be harder for whales to collect massive sums without holders willingly selling. In order to obtain another large amount of coins, they would need to buy them up from exchanges, which would drive prices up, and they could potentially lose a lot more money then they started with. Otherwise, why wouldn't a millionaire just arbitrage Bitcoin to death? 
As a cleaner fish myself, I welcome whales.

Thank you for the debate, but I'm gonna say it. This debate style kind of stinks. eh, not kind of, it just does. 
Its I got a few minutes to state my side, you got a few minutes to state your side,  then we get a few minutes to sort of interact annnnnd its done. 
When one side makes a point, and then the other side refutes it. The first talkers don't get a chance to really get to describe and get into detail their points.  
What you guys need is a joe rogan style 3 hour discussion. Where every nook and cranny of the conversation can be ironed out. Maybe the Pro-app coin has serious benefits that can't be addressed in their 3 minutes because they are using that time to try and rebuttal some asinine point. 
This debate feels rushed and feels like no points were seriously debated or really broken down. We got to chip away at these until nothing is left to be discussed.  Drill down til you get to the core of the points. I really want to know why app-coins are feasible or not feasible. not just lump them in with frequent flier miles and leave it at that. 
Longer discussions with more interaction between the debaters. its obvious we can keep it civil, let break the structure, light a joint, and get to the bottom of this!

Seems to me that there should be a service or an app that you can send a payment to a static address, then it will automatically send it to your HD wallet.

how much more? Just a little more? Or a lot more?
Darknet markets can also sell legal items too. Like hidden safes. for example the shaving cream can. Darknet Markets aren't intrinsically evil. Its simply an platform that facilitates trade between person A and B.  If they are trading bitcoin for legal goods then whats the problem? Now if people D &amp; E coming along and start trading illegal goods, that shouldn't make the transactions between person A and B illegal. 
Thats like being in a conveince store and a weed deal is made in the back. Doesn't make all the legal goods illegal. 
However, since those products are illegal, its up to the store owner to make sure the products in their store are on the up and up. Same goes with the DNM. 
So really, the punishment should fall on the site owner and those doing illegal purchases/sales. But being there shouldn't be deemed illegal. 
and lastly, NEVER TALK TO POLICE.

From January of 2012 Bitcoin went from a peak of $7 to a gradual decline over 4 months to $4.xx.
I bet everyone thought it was the end of the world for bitcoin back then. Losing almost 40% over 4 months in a gradual decline. 
Then something happened and it peaked back up. 
I think We are just waiting for the big players to really get involved and drive people to want to get bitcoin.

ok, so we give them $20 to buy beers at this party. The beer vendors now have most of the 5 million dollars. How does this help Dominica's economy? Are the beer vendors buying supplies locally? are the beer/party employee's getting paid in bitcoin? How is this money getting put into the economy of Dominica?
To me this looks like a bitcoin scam. Get a bunch of people to donate to a "bitcoin nation" (soon they will try to do this for whole communities) and throw a Bitcoin party where  whoever shows up, gets a small domination of bitcoins to spend. Taking them straight home seems like a cowardice move. How dare you be given money and not spend any of it at the venue it was given to you at. Boom. Event organizers and vendors get most of the donated money. 
I know I sound pessimistic, and I hate thinking like this, but it sort of makes sense. I would like more details on how the whole process will go. I have given away bitcoin a bunch of times. And the mycelium app allows me to watch addresses that I don't control. So when I give someone bitcoin, I save their address and check it every once in a while to see if they are doing anything with it. I give $10 away at a time and no one does anything with it. I just see giving people $20 of internet money, sure they will spend some of it at the party, but then they will have $3 or $6 or $10 leftover and they probably wont spend it on anything. I bet most of it just gets put into abandoned wallets. 
I really think you need to give them a meaningful amount that they can redeem serious stuff with. Minimum of $100-150. That's a lot of food or enough to fix or replace something you really need but been holding off on. But $20 is like, okay I guess I'll buy a couple beers(that were imported by vendors) and forget about the rest of this coupon. 
like I said, I dont know, I would like to hear more details from or someone from the organization. 
Edit: after writing all that, I feel like I may have got my bitcoin stories mixed up. I kept thinking of the budweiser/music festival bitcoin thing. Which I totally support, I just want to see this dominica bitcoin project try to keep the bitcoin within the local economy. for the time being.

while I agree with him, he doesnt really say why its performing poorly. What I think is right before bitcoin hit market highs of 1100, it had climbed to about 200-230 then boomed. 
But I dont think it was ever meant to go that high. Karpeles made a couple bots called the willy bot and something else. those bought and sold bitcoins, he lost control of them and they artificially jacked up the price on Mt. Gox. 
With Mt. Gox being the biggest exchange, it artificially drove up the demand on other exchanges. Mt. Gox was always about $100 or more above everyone else. And I bet greedy investors were sending money out of the other exchanges and sending them to mt. gox trying to profit off that arbitrage. 
Well, we all know the meaning behind, "don't get gox'd"
So its my theory that bitcoin was never supposed to climb that high, that fast. And the price probably should of just stayed around 200-250 for the last year or so. And it might finally be reaching equilibrium with supply and demand. 
When the halving happens and continents like south America, Africa and asia wake up to this technology. Expect big things to happen with the price. Until then, expect a drop as low as $190 and hodl tight.

the way I see it, since bitcoins are being produced every ten minutes, at $300 each thats about $1 million USD a day. If people don't put in atleast $1 million a day, the price will slowly drop until the inflationary period is over. then it will be much less inflationary. Now it will be up to the people to pick it up and use it. And when they start trading it for value and wealth transfers, that is when Bitcoin can grow to untold numbers.

Its all about that market cap. Right now its only at roughly 4.6 Billion dollars. So that means if someone with 10 million dollars comes in, they can raise or lower the price a little bit. 
Once the market cap of bitcoin gets to a gigantic size, people with even millions of dollars wont be able to move the market. 
Right now, bitcoin is in price discovery mode. It just needs to get bigger to stabilize. But as more big business and countries actually start to move into this space, it will grow and stabilize. Right now its just a roller coaster of emotions. 
Hold and stay strong.

But really the dollar is only solid like it is through manipulation that we don't outwardly see. Real money is volatile as people convert and extract their wealth from it. Fiat currencies aren't real money.

everytime I go into a weed shop and take out cash. It pings me $3.50 at their shitty little atm. Then my Credit Union pings me another $1.50. 
Argh! 
I think weed shops just need to lie to coinbase/bitpay and say they are selling baked goods. So they can convert their Bitcoin to Fiat when needed and not worry about closure of their accounts. 
but when you lie to cover up, I guess you are always at risk of closure.

I don't think the love of money is a bad thing. As long as you are a producer and not a looter. If you make money in an honest way, the love of earning it can be full filling. 
But if you take your money from producers while not creating anything yourself, you are just a looter. I think that's why banks are often looked at as evil.  I think a lot of young folk have been brought up to hate money, which more or less just keeps them in a just sustainable loop of poverty. or just getting by. paycheck to paycheck type mentality.

Lets have a thought experiment and pretend Karpeles really is Satoshi and did invent Bitcoin, invented the silk road, and used Mt. Gox to pump his coins. I will never believe this because Satoshi seems so stoic with him being a man of few words, and the message of banks embedded into the genesis block. And Mark just seems so dopey with his tweets about the sony hacks and seemingly social unawareness. 
But back to the point, what if it turns out that Mark invented Bitcoin? What does that do to it? Does the associated reputation tarnish the money, or does bitcoin eat that bad news and continue on? Think normal people would just flood out, and leave it for the bankers and VC's?

your short sighted because you think like a central banker. Whenever "your" currency of choice isn't invested in, you take it as a personal attack. Whats right with litecoin? how about every single thing that is right with Bitcoin. Litecoin holds all the same properties, the major difference being the amount produced. 84 million. 
I think paper money is going to go away sometime, and individual countries will eventually start issuing their own cryptocurrencies. And the worlds wealth is so vast, that to try and fit it all into a single currency is idiotic.

no one knows how GBTC is going to raise or lower in value. I doubt the value of GBTC is linked to BTC itself. 
Here's what I'm guessing is going on. I think GBTC has its supply of bitcoin. And its going to sell shares to its investors. As more shares get bought, less is available, price goes up.  And since you cant throw your own BTC into GBTC's supply, Silbert controls the supply for the demand. Sort of like the diamond industry where the supply is artificially low. 
So even though bitcoin could sink or skyrocket, GBTC could remain stable for its investors.

in order for it to have any affect,  you have to assume, people will buy  gold again. 
Lets pretend: Say we asked everyone to give up a gram or more of gold until 10% of the total supply was gone. Now its in orbit and gone. For the markets to bump up, everyone who gave up their gold, would need to reinvest into it. What if they didn't?  You are assuming everyone would reinvest.

Well the dollar has been growing stronger on bitcoin all year long. 
The real trick is to know when to switch out your assets. there are wealth cycles/waves in everything. When precious metals are at all times lows, its good to invest in that, then if the dollar gets really weak against the metals, switch it out. When real estate is cheap, invest in that, then take your money back out and invest in something else that is low, but you can be assured that it will most likely to grow again. Precious metals, currencies, property, bitcoin. Investing is playing hot potato with your money. But its a good way to make money if you don't mind being a leecher.

dont be butt hurt and downvote because you think there can only be one crypto-currency. The market is way big enough for several. Explain yourselves. Make your argument against mine. Its a fair request.
The question is, could I stand to make more putting $1,000 into bitcoin, or $1,000 into litecoin?
BTC: $276.00 (x $1,000) = 3.62 BTC's
LTC: $2.06 (x $1,000) = 485 LTC's
Sell at $1,000/btc = $3623 for BTC.
Sell at $30/ltc = $14,550.00 for LTC
Both crypto's have known to go that high. And When bitcoin does good/bad the other crypto's ride along with it. 
Currently Litecoin is at about 133:1 ratio

oh I know there is no promise on getting your premium back, but if people are paying for the premium, then theres a chance when you go to sell, others will pay the premium to. But time will tell what happens. 
Heck, I paid a premium for most of my bitcoins. Most of mine were bought above the $240 of today's current price. I could sell them all right now, but I'll hold and wait to see if the price goes back up. Just like the share holders of GBTC.

A money grab? Don't know what barbaric country you come from but in most of Europe the government loses money from vaccines since they are free.
Don't work? Wot get me data.
Want to know why we get sick even if we vaccinate? BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T VACCINATE. Vaccinating only protects you against the old virus. IF someone gets sick with the old virus, it will change inside them. THIS will then infect people who vaccinate. If everyone vaccinated no one would ever catch these. But if 1 person doesn't vaccinate, and 1000000000 do. They can still all get sick from that 1 persons mutated bullshit.
Vaccines are free? Do they find them under rocks and behind bushes? Perhaps from a Vaccine tree??
Because I thought they cost hundreds of millions to develop. The gov't may pass them out as free, but someone has to pay for them. Guess who you think that cost is being passed on to?
And you're afraid of Influenza? People get it every single year, they are sicky for a couple days and they live on. Just like the human race has for hundreds of thousands of years. 
Vaccines are like the diet pill. Sure they may work to get a similar result, but the truth is, there is no free lunch or shortcuts to proper health.  Eat healthy, Exercise daily, And stay clean. Soap and Water is what it takes to get rid of most diseases. Notice how most outbreaks come from 3rd world countries that dont have clean water?

what the hell are you talking about? Minimum wage does get you a $500 Rental. I'm in California, Minimum Wage is $11/hour.
$11 * 40 hours(per week) = $440 before taxes. $1760/Month before taxes. Even if taxed at 35% That is $1,144 after taxes.  What is greater? $500 Rent or $1,144 Paycheck? You can live on minimum wage. Its a shitty life, but you can live.

Just like how a tomato is stored energy from Water, Sun, and the organic material it took to create and store that "wealth/energy" in a tomato, the same can be said for Bitcoins. 
It took energy to create a bitcoin, and now that economic energy is stored within Bitcoin. You can then unleash it later for a pair of shoes or anything really.

you are confused. Your debt doesn't grow with deflation. Your debt stays at $200k(if there is no interest attached) but your wage will go up and up and up. 
Its like buying a $25k house in the 1950's and you have $1.50/hr job. As time passes by, your wage goes up, but you only owe $25k because that is what you aggreed to buy the house for.

I think you are forgetting that bitcoin is in inflation period right now. 25 bitcoins are being produced every 10 minutes. That's $6,500 being "printed" every 10 minutes. That's $936,000 every day. The fact that its holding pretty stable is pretty amazing. I wish I had the money to buy more. 
When inflation drops down to miniscule levels, you will see really steep incline in the price I think. Especially by then, more of the world will want to jump on board as it proves itself over time.

absolutely. But if this guy can't be bothered to download a wallet app that takes 30 seconds to do. Then what are the odds of him keeping a paper wallet safe for a year and then using it?
Don't take it from him without asking him. Before you drain it, just ask him if he ever did anything with that paper wallet. You'll know he didn't spend the funds cuz you can check the balance. If he says, "oh boy! I got it locked up in my safe. I've been saving it!" Then rest assured that you gave it to the right person. But he may be honest and say, "aww man, I'm not really sure where I put it..." then just smile continue whatever conversation you had before and retrieve the money. Giving it right back to him would be like throwing it away again.

I bet most of his students have smart phones. They can all download a bitcoin wallet app. 
What I would do if I were him is to go to a site where he can print out newly generated paper wallets, one after another. Print 50 of them. 
Then he holds up his phone up to the class and show them the $50 balance. And each time a student gets an answer correct. He hands them the blank wallet, then scans it and sends them $1 right then and there. Boom. Now if the student wants that dollar, they can upload it to their smart phone wallet app or throw it away or whatever. 
That seems like a simple and effective way to do it. And the teacher can tell them not to redeem it until after class so they all don't have their phones out.

I dont give a rip about chinese knock off cars. There will be literally millions of crypto currencies in the future. Bitcoin is great, but its not the end all. And the part where your analogy doesn't hold water is chinese knock off is made with inferior materials. Thus making it cheaper. Alt coins use all the strengths of bitcoin and implented further features immediately instead of waiting on Bitcoin to change. There is nothing wrong with litecoin. 
Don't ignore all crypto currencies just because you like Bitcoin the best. I'm all in on Bitcoin and Litecoin myself. I don't play with the other cryptos as of right now. But I would like to pick up some Namecoins and Storj or whatever product becomes dominant in the Decentralized data storage field.

I've been really pleased with this wallet. 
From their Website. 
Keep all kinds of different coins on the same wallet! Coinomi's multi-coin nature allows you to control all different coins through a single app! No more need to keep and maintain all sorts of wallets on your devices and having to go through the pain of having to deal with unsynchronized, bandwidth and storage demanding, slow and non-responsive wallet apps!
**Very Secure**
Your private keys never leave your device. We use strong public cryptography and the best industry practices. We make sure that your money is totally safe by ensuring that you have the ultimate control over it! Your wallet is encrypted with a master password making it very resistant against hackers and malicious software.
**Enhanced Privacy**
Coinomi favors privacy in a way that it doesn't perform any kind of association between your real-world identity and your wallet, your funds or even the way you spend or obtain them. No personal details ever go through Coinomi and spending your funds is totally anonymous as Coinomi hides your IP address from the rest of the world when pushing your transactions to the blockchain.
**One-time Backup**
All your coins are accessed with one Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (BIP44), so instead of having to regularly back-up every wallet for every single coin, all you have to do is keep a simple phrase in a safe place (even on a piece of paper) only once! Never lose your funds ever again!
Use your altcoins to pay directly to bitcoin addresses and vice versa! No intermediate stages, no sign-up required, spend your any-coins to make any-coin payments through a single-click process! Coinomi is the fastest and most convenient wallet when it comes to heterogeneous payments and cross-chain transactions!
**Exchange Inside**
Converting from one coin to another is ridiculously easy, only a few taps away and totally anonymous with our embedded ShapeShift integration. Change from one coin to another instantly and anonymously in an accountless manner. And the best part: we don't charge you anything on top of ShapeShift for the conversion!
**Open Source**
Coinomi is open source which means the code is publicly available, can be reviewed by everyone and anyone can suggest changes. No hidden code, no malicious modules, no exploits, no small letters. Why trust your money to closed-source wallets when you can keep it in a publicly reviewed, totally transparent wallet?
Light as a feather! Coinomi is specifically designed to be able to run smoothly even in older, low-spec devices.
Apart from English, Coinomi is also translated to the Greek, Chinese and Japanese languages, with more translations coming soon!

What does he mean no one is going to accept bitcoin as payment for labor? Sounds like he is arguing for paper currency. But with direct deposit and a debit card, most of my fiat is virtual too. I literally don't have any dollars on me right now. Or is my debit card the tangible thing that is "hitting the ground"?  Does he know you can store bitcoins on a cell phone and use your phone as your "debit card"?
I would absolutely trade my labor/productivity for bitcoin. I just wish more people accepted it as tender.

also, I would keep the paper wallets blank until you hand it over. Filling the paper wallet will only take a second, and it shows the students how to do it and they see how easy it is. 
Another thing is if they are prefilled, a student may be tempted to steal the batch. So keeping them blank would help curb that I think. 
You can make a new wallet for each period/class. And fill each with $50.

I was thinking, Grades (A, B, C, D and F) are like fiat currency for schools. They give you a piece of worthless paper with a letter on it and they make us believe it means something. The ones with the A are really good! The ones with the F's are really bad! And we believe it. Its a really old invention. 
What if we did away with grades and gave school questions value. Super early math for 1st graders can be worth 1 cent, 2 cents. and by time they reach highschool questions can be worth 25 cents to over a dollar.
Instead of saying, "Jimmy, you have a 2.3 GPA, you need to step it up" 
We could be saying, "Jimmy, you only got $3,658 in your student fund. Other students on average have about $5,500 in your class. If you expect to be able to afford a good college by time you graduate, you need to study harder and get more correct answers. Try pumping out some extra credit. Read, how to kill a mocking bird and do the online survey, its a $20 credit to your education fund." Students could be encouraged to read outside of school and complete a survey online.
lol. think about it. Instead of flunking them, just let them know they should have earned a certain amount of education money by certain points.

i just had a thought: In the future law will be mandated that business and companies may have/use automated robots, but they can not own them. 
So business will have to hire and install robots from government. Just as there are billions of workers today, there will be billions of robot workers across the globe. And in order for these robots to function they will need to be sent some crypto currency just like if you want a juke box to work. 
Thats where the public steps in and powers these things. And the money the robots earn while producing goods is sent back to the owner of the crypto that was deposited. 
Now, everyone can make an income while being free from needing to be at a factory all day. The Age of Art will boom.

The anchor, the one solid thing that the US dollar has that makes it a real value of wealth to him is... Taxes. You can use it to pay taxes.  So if the gov't accepted bitcoin as payment for taxes, would that make it all of a sudden a legitimate store of value? Is that the only thing that separates Real money from Phony money??
Then he says how its unlikely that bitcoin can prop itself up, Not impossible, just unlikely he says. Well Mr. Krugman, its been 5-6 years now. Its still here and you are talking about it in a very professional and publicized setting. Tell me more how its irrelevant.

And her naturally appearing wavy golden brown hair looks good drapped over one side. I used to love it when my old ex gf would wear her hair like this. There is something subtlety sexual about it. Almost like the exposing of her neck makes her vulnerable and brings a hint of 'come tither'.  Maybe she realizes all this and understands the subtleties that brings in more male viewers. If that is the case, then my arguement is SHE HAD MY COMPLIMENT COMING!" lol.

I wonder what the problems that they foresee are?
I just don't see it being able to handle multiple billions of daily transactions.  At least not in this configuration. Or with a single blockchain. Hence the need for something like Litecoin to pick up some of the slack. And maybe a couple others too.

"Our current monetary system is just ones and zeros, how stupid are people" Crowd belly laughs.
He seems to relish in his "belieif" that bitcoin isn't doing too good. He looks like a homeless person being served a feast when he mentally visualizes it.
The anchor, the one solid thing that the US dollar has that makes it a real value of wealth to him is... Taxes. You can use it to pay taxes. So if the gov't accepted bitcoin as payment for taxes, would that make it all of a sudden a legitimate store of value? Is that the only thing that separates Real money from Phony money??
Then he says how its unlikely that bitcoin can prop itself up, Not impossible, just unlikely he says. Well Mr. Krugman, its been 5-6 years now. Its still here and you are talking about it in a very professional and publicized setting. Tell me more how its irrelevant.
Then he uses libertarian ideology as a derogatory term.
Krugman, you are playing the game of Capitalism very excellently. People will look back at this time in history and see that you were a blind supporter of the empire. Your words are recorded for the rest of time and too me, you are just saying the emporeors clothes seem fantastic.

what would you manually override?
Do you mean, just shut everything off? okay, what happens when you turn everything back on? Its probably still going to be locked up by the malware. 
The only solution I can think of is this: Your entire house will be linked up to a single Hard drive with a "House Operating System" (HOS). All the programs are installed on it. It controls everything from that hard drive. 
If someone were to come and lock up your house, you would just shut it down, remove the hard drive, insert a brand new one, then using a usb drive, install a fresh HOS on the new hard drive. You would have to configure your whole house again and it would be a pain in the dick, but... what else are you going to do? Pay some twat the ransom? 
The HOS should have a trezor like usb drive key. Want to change a setting? plug in the encrypted hardware key first. Boom!

you know, with 5G internet coming, blocksize may be irrelevant. We'll be able to download blockchains hundreds of terrabytes big in minutes. The average person will be able to run a node if they wish to. So raising the blocksize wouldn't lead to centralization of the blockchain custody. 
with 5G will come bigger blocks.

who said it would be gold backed?
If they create a Finite Supply of their Crypto-currency, it would become the "Gold Standard" of money. Notice the quotation marks.
Then they just convince the world gov'ts to put in tons of money or assets. Now you have a currency that is worth Trillions of dollars and the price wont move much even if individuals cashed out millions of dollars at a time. Gov'ts can evaluate their local currency against this New World Currency. 
This doesn't destroy Bitcoin or any other market. Just like how Bitcoin hasn't destroyed the Gold and Silver markets. 
The only thing that sucks about this, is that it wont be a fair and even distribution.  Countries and World Financial systems will get first grabs at this NWC, then major global companies, then the Billionaires, then the Millionaires, and lastly the peasants may be able to purchase this new currency at its height, but everyone who got in early will benefit the most.  Just like Bitcoin, but giving the wealthiest early adopters the most advantage.

Bitcoin doesn't pose any risk to anyones wealth. Bitcoin is the safe haven, but only when it gets much bigger than it is now. 
The problem with the super rich is, If they put a Billion dollars in, its going to affect the price greatly. And a lot of the early adopters and day traders are going to sell. Its like throwing your money into a pit of zombie hands. 
Normal people can't individually move the price anymore, so its a pretty safe bet for us. Everyone making less than $50,000 shouldn't be able to lose a lot. With a 6 Billion dollar market cap, People who could be considered Thousandaires can probably start moving large sums of money. Like $5000-$30,000. 
But in order for Millionaires to start moving Hundreds of thousands of dollars into Bitcoin, I think the Market cap is going to have to raise quite a bit. 
And in order for Billionaires to put millions into bitcoin, it will probably need at least $100 Billion market cap. 
Then the next step is for Banks and Gov'ts to put in Billions the Market cap will have to be multiple Trillions. 
I just pulled all this out of my butt, but its what I think needs to happen before Bitcoin goes truly global. 
But to reiterate Bitcoin is not a threat. Its a beautiful green pasture on a sunday morning. Welcoming all to use it and leave when ever you would like.

Honestly, Soccer moms and people in law enforcement or gov't are the people who typically fit the statist name sake the most. They just want everything safe so the future will be good for their children and so on. But in order to achieve this, you definitely need a state to come lock away bad people. I would also say people who have achieved medium/high quality of life are also like this. Those making $100k+ a year don't want all their shit stolen. So they typically support the state. Statist typically think of themselves as Democrats or Republicans.

Yeah I heard our current radiowaves from phones are causing cancer. And 5G radiowaves are much smaller and hence faster. Basically, 5G radiowaves are more dense and have more adverse effects sooner. 
I also heard that it can be used to map entire areas around the towers. Imagine them having a 3D video Camera in a bunch of places. Mapping the United States.  I could imagine if a murder happens, they just log into the nearest 5G tower and zoom to the event and watch it take place and possibly follow the suspect to where ever they may have gone.

@_date: 2019-04-18 06:02:27
you dont get it. When we run out of blockspace and someone wants to get into the next block for sure, what do they do? They increase their Transaction Fee. Then the Next guy wants to be in the next block more than the last will pay a higher transaction fee. And then people compete for space with higher and higher fees. 
The solution is easy. Increase blocksize to keep the fees low and EVERYONE gets into the next block. But even at 1MB blocks, the current blockchain is 100GB. Most people dont want to download something that big. And even if we made the block just 2mb which wont help that much, the blockchain will be much bigger. This will lead to only corporations being able to download a blockchain hundreds of terrabytes in size. And thus Centralization. 
But 5G and 6G will allow us to download 100GB like its a 10MB file.  Thus, increasing the blocksize wont be a big deal in a 5/6G world.

Using a Bitcoin wallet, even one as smooth and frictionless as mycelium will be a pain in the ass at check outs. With how standardized the card swipers are now, it can still take people forever to use them. I'm sure we have all seen the customer and cashier staring at each other waiting, then the cashier says, you need to confirm it. 
Now imagine pulling out a smart phone, lots of peoples phones are older and slow and laggy. Pulling up the app, a few more seconds there, navigating the app and scanning the QR with the bar code reader... confirming on both ends the transaction went thru...
I think for bitcoin to be mainstream, there really needs to be a card issuing middleman. or just something smoother than whats available currently.

You place a bitcoin up for sale today at $225, but you won't actually sell it for a month. (sometime in the **"Future"**)

You will need to use paypal to accept money online.(fees) And to start a store, it cost money for the domain. (more fees)


Hence, open bazaar. 


Open Bazaar might not be the most efficient platform today. But with it being open source and worked on by free lancers taking donations, it will slowly grow to be better and better. Paypal didn't have all the options it has today when it first began. 
People will work on Open bazaar for free or for donations. Look at the recent modding fiasco with The Steam Platform.

The reason why I don't think bitcoin is a passing fad and it should always be around is because it has value. So people will always want to try and get some. Money talks.  
The biggest difference between bitcoin and beanie babies and tulips is that it is a truly scarce resource. It can not be created outside the protocol and be snuck into the bitcoin ecosystem. 
Its possible that bitcoin will be worth only a fraction of what it is today. But I think it will have a cult/fringe following until forever. 
Copper is everywhere and its not worth a whole bunch, but people get themselves killed trying to pull copper electricity lines out of houses and abandoned places. It has a known value and if someone can aqcuire some and sell it for fiat, they will. This is why I believe bitcoin is not a passing fad.

well, you got to remember the last time bitcoin was at this price, there were a whole lot less bitcoins in circulation. So for bitcoin to maintain this price point per bitcoin while having X amount more bitcoins in circulation means its definitely growing in strength/value. 
Just think about the last time it was at this price. What if 1.4 million bitcoins were suddenly dropped into the market.  Bitcoin is doing okay. Its just a slow steady absorption of the inflationary period. I expect bitcoin to keep decreasing in value until the halving, then a jump in price. And then another slow decline until the next halving and so on. unless everyone suddenly sees the utility and value in a scarce resource and jumps onboard. 
Time will tell.

Well the difference between the darknet markets and LBTC is that LBTC is a legit business not needing to worry about Federal agents butt raping them at any moment.

how does one buy a coin from one's self?
You give the bitcoins to people for goods and services, then you replenish what you spent. Hence distributing them among the public. Making whole coins more and more scarce. This is what will make bitcoin grow.

no. The stoner guy was day trading bitcoin when the real scammer said he wanted to buy bitcoin. The stoner dude said okay. So money starts pouring into his bank account and he sends the bitcoin.
Now the guy who bought the truck, sent money to the stoners Bank of America account and he never received his truck. So he is going after the account holder that he sent the funds to. 
At least that is the story the stoner kid is saying.

And he uses scrip in place of legal tender. Scrip is private credit/IOU when legal tender is not available.  A good example is an isolated mining camp. They get paid in "scrip" and the mining camp can raise prices on food because they only accept the scrip/mining iou.

Came here to say this. OP doesn't know how the market works. 
Just so its clear to anyone else this is what happens. 
You find a reputable dealer. 
Send him/her your address for the drugs and you deposit the bitcoins into the site's escrow. 
The dealer ships the drugs. When the drugs arrive you go on the market and finalize the deal. Unlocking the bitcoins to the drug dealer. The bitcoins could sit there for a week depending on shipping time.
So all the coins that were stolen were most likely pending finalization. 
I'm not entirely sure what happens if your product is wrong or doesn't turn up. I guess you file a complaint and the admins will personally check the facts of the situation.

it will probably be an altcoin that will be exclusively used by banks world wide just to transfer value from one bank to the other.

I like the idea of a screen that shows you local places that accept bitcoin. 
But as for the educational video stuff, there should be an option where you can type in your email and it will send the person heaps of info to look at  on their own time. 
If I'm out and about, I'm usually trying to get from one place to the next. No real time to lolly gag. I want to be able to walk up, scan the QR code, receive the Bitcoin. Maybe check out which areas around me accept bitcoin(food places). 
If desired, the machine could send you a receipt via email and you can opt in for additional info. That would be ideal in my mind.

When bitcoin is 400,000 a coin and the price goes up or down by a couple hundred dollars a day. No one will barely notice their stashes fluctuating.  
You would literally need to own at least one whole bitcoin and have a bank account with 400,000 to see it move that $100/day. And at that point, why would you even care about $100?

@_date: 2015-10-29 03:07:26
lol. you wish. I want it to stay low for as long as possible while I collect it.  
This is my own made up theory. So take it for what it is. I think Bitcoin is at a pretty good spot right now. If you cut out all the Mt. Gox ramp up that was provably artificial by Mt. Gox itself, then since about November of 2013 to today, bitcoin has gone up from about 230-300ish. But most of that has been in the last month, and a lot in the last week or so. If you draw a ramp line, I say by this time next year, it might be at $500 a coin. Maybe $700 the year after. 
also, back in June/July Bitcoin peaked to 318 and then dropped to 198. It could do the same again. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:20:09

I was selling bitcoin on Craigslist. Built up a relationship with one guy. He was buying couple hundred dollars worth each week. Asked for a few advances and he always settled up. Then right before Black Friday he bought like $300ish. Then he texted me saying he forgot it was black friday and if I could forward him $150 worth. I did. 
Then he dropped out. I should have stuck to my guns and not have loaned it with out the cash in hand. But I'm a bleeding heart... 
Lesson Learned though! :D

could you imagine if the US ends up adopting crypto currency and telling Americans to put their cash/money into their 401k by a specific date. Whatever is in their 401k is what will be handed to them in the new USAcoin. After that date, the US will no longer support the dollar bill making it worthless paper.

@_date: 2015-03-06 05:47:40
yeah, I was listening to a podcast called stacking benjimens and they were saying how they didn't "get" bitcoin either. I guess they have a friend who is really into it. 
But go with me as I am thinking this out. So the private key will almost always be physical unless you memorize it, but since most people wont/cant they will need to store it on some sort of media. 
And since the private key is literally just a line of characters it can be stored on almost any media format. I can't think of a media format that cant store a private key. 
Could you imagine having 100k dollars in silver then the shit hitting the fan and trying to escape with it all? That right there is the beauty of bitcoin. Since its stored in the blockchain, your personal bitcoins might as well be in the center of the earth. Thats a pretty secure place... for now. ;) 
i love bitcoin.

I think you need to explain it further for noobs in general. 
What coolbitme means is get a wallet like Mycellium, coinomi, or bread wallet and store it in there. If you are using coinbase or circle, remove your bitcoin immediately from there. 
long story short, if any company holds the access keys to your bitcoin address, then you don't really control your bitcoins. Because they could potentially lock you out of your own bitcoins for one reason or another.

what pisses you off about utorrent?
I have literally used it for many years, its practically the only one I have ever used and have had zero problems with it, and I enjoy the UI. It keeps getting a little more polished. 
I did try a different torrent downloader a while back, but it didn't allow me to select/deselect individual files inside the torrent before downloading like utorrent, so I went back to utorrent. 
Again, I have had zero problems, but I am probably not using all the functionalities.  I just find a show/movie, get the torrent. run it. Deselect all the junk files (seeded by torrent king dot com!! text files) Keep just the media file, download and watch later.  What is there to go wrong?
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:19:42
DONT STORE IN COINBASE!!

The only other serious contender in the crypto space in my eyes is Litecoin. Dogecoin has its place, but not as a serious or professional unit of account. 
But other alt-coins like Storj and namecoin are going to have their place in the world. 
But the fact is, Local currencies can be a very good thing. If your town decides to issue a currency it can help spur up local commerce. That is a fact. Plus it could end up being a token of pride, just like how people rep their area codes on their phones. Nowadays people keep their homeland area code instead of getting a new one locally. It almost becomes a sense of pride. 
There is nothing wrong with local currencies. Its like saying everyone should only be using the US dollar. No peso, no yen, no dollarydoos, nothing but green USD. Dont worry about bitcoin, it will do its thing just like how copper, gold, silver, and all the other precious metals hold value. 
I dont know, maybe you think bitcoin is a get rich scheme which it isn't. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:03:41
question. When you put (just an example )$500 on the prepaid card with bitcoin. And the price went up, did the value of the card go up as well? 
I'm just a little confused. Seems like you traded your bitcoin for a fixed value card. So I am failing to see how you gained money when the price went up. Unless, you bought your bitcoin at $250 and held onto it, then put the higher value bitcoin into the card a while after purchasing it.
@_date: 2015-03-10 08:36:29

There is enough room for a $10,000 Bitcoin and a $500 Litecoin and many others.

But the sad most probable truth is, there will always be a terrorist of one kind or another. 
Even if every drug in the world were to be legal, bad people would still find ways to be shitty. Like poaching or sex slavery. They will become the priority targets to stop. Making child prostitution legal I don't think is an acceptable answer. 
But as these sickos are created, technology will helps us catch them and put them away.

*takes mask off* aha! I am actually an experienced bitcoin user. The correct answer is No. The circle app can not be used right away because it requires you to link up your bank account information. And that is a minor hassle and takes a few days to process. But after that, you wouldn't need to visit a bitcoin Teller machine ever again. 
The point is, in the video Andreas addresses why a really simple system like the one you stated is bad for mass adoption. people dont know which wallet to use because there are over 30. and some wallets like circle and coinbase are not like a general use wallet. 
Andreas argues that the machine should be like a help kiosk. Where you can learn about local businesses that accept bitcoin and how to use and set up wallets or something. videos.

I've thought about that and another easy solution is to ask for an email address and the machine will send a nice email with all the additional info and links with videos and such. That way people can learn/watch videos on their phones/pc on their own time. Not in the middle of a hustling and bustling city. 
Instead of "New User" maybe have a "set up a brand new wallet" button. It asks for an email, sends it then tells you to return when you have your wallet all set up and ready to go on your phone.  
@_date: 2015-10-01 08:51:52
Yes, but if you are going to have a stateless cash, than every state(and person within) will need the ability to surveillance it to maintain its authenticity. 
But anyone at anytime can generate a new address and send/receive money. Can it be tracked, yes. Does it give away your meta data, no. It simply says, data went from this address to that address.

The $25 coffee guy was a prick. $25 dollar minimum for  "Volatility". go fuck yourself. 
And it wasn't even $25 for a single coffee. In this case, even if bitcoin dropped by 50% over night, he would still have atleast $12.50.
But he simply sold more coffees putting him at even bigger risk of volatility because he just gave away $25 worth of product. 
I want to know what coffee place that was and never go there because of his predatory techniques on nerds.

A couple months ago, I sold a little over $1000 worth of bitcoin. That and some bonus cash, about 1.5 months of salary, helped me get completely out of Debt. Now that I have no debt and my first free paycheck(all bills are paid for the month) comes on the first of November, the price starts shooting upward. Great... 
But here we are, hopefully you are in a position to put any spare cash into bitcoin. Just remember anything under $2000 is a great price for bitcoin. after that, it just becomes money.

You are out of touch. Of course my view isn't the mainstream. Keeping up with the Kardashians is mainstream. 
But to say bitcoin is hard to acquire, its not. Coinbase and Circle make it super easy.
To say its not cheap is a lie. It cost 1% to acquire. I just bought a $239 bitcoin and all it cost me was $2.39. Have you ever tried to buy silver?
To say its not fun is your opinion. Look at Morgan Spurlocks face in his latest bitcoin documentary. He looks like he is having fun. I've had a lot of fun conversations about bitcoin. 
Addictive? I've been checking the price and this subreddit daily since halloween of 2013. The guy who I bought my first bitcoin from told me, "last night was your last night of good sleep." I was up til 3am everynight for the first week when the bitcoin bug bit me.  
Easy to comphrehend? It can be with metaphors but bitcoin is not easy to grasp right away. But that is a good thing. If it was as simple as rocks in a bucket, no one would take it seriously. 
So no, my views are not mainstream, but you can't sit there and tell me Flappy Bird has all these things that bitcoin doesn't.

There should be an expiration date on paper wallets. Kind of like how if a changetip tip isn't collected within a week, the money goes back to the issuer. 
If they don't take the money off the paper wallet and put it into an account they own, then after a week if should just go back to you. It would make tipping in real life much more fun.
