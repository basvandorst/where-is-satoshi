As the person asking for advice I am hesitant to give advice... but I wouldn't worry about it. The only time I would report a loss is if it was previously reported to the IRS through a W-2G. If you used bitcoin, you almost certainly didn't get one of those. 
Obviously if you net positive in gambling you would also want to report your losses as well as winnings.

I will consult a CPA at tax season, but based on what I have gathered, this seems to be perfectly reasonable and accurate to me.
Bovada took the bet in US dollars. Assuming my screenshot of the ticket is proof enough, the fact that the bet was placed in bitcoin, and currently holds value in the form of investment property (from the IRS perspective) is not relevant.
Claim the gambling winnings now. Claim the capital gains when I sell. 
Makes sense to me. I will verify but thanks for the reply!

I guess I don't see why it would be harder for wallet software to track money spent than a Fidelity account to track investments sold. Plenty of personal brokerage accounts make 10s or 100s of transactions a day. 
I agree they are not the same, but I use that analogy because they are currently viewed the same in the eyes of the IRS as far as I can tell.

That's an accurate criticism.
I guess it's really not any different than an actively traded brokerage account. 
Just like a brokerage account, I would owe capital gains every time I "spent" (sold) bitcoin. And the value of the item I bought in USD vs the value of the bitcoin when I bought it in USD would be the capital gain.
The reality is that I dont keep track of that on my brokerage account. That is part of the reason I am willing to pay Fidelity a small commission. They will report everything to the IRS and the IRS will tell me exactly what I owe.
In the case of bitcoin, no one reports anything to the IRS, and it's up to you to decide what you are going to pay, if anything. 
Not to make it sound like I know what I'm talking about. Just thinking out loud here.

That is true. Luckily in this case, I bought and transfered the bitcoin in a matter of minutes. I like to follow the rules but I'm not entering capital gains on $0.01
