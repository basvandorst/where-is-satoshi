@_date: 2018-03-30 00:34:11

@_date: 2018-02-05 03:00:15
Im not, i could pay it off in other ways, but i could also do it with my bit investment
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:38:40
Here goes the panic  / dump from the pump. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:03:56
small sized orders can also be theres not enough buy at one point so it fills others. smaller orders.  you cant sell 4mil bitcoins for 1 price. take forever. so he spread them amounts many 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:40:45
hasnt hit 9k, hard to believe your making money between 9800 and 9950
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:51:01
I think the pathetic FUD people are hilarious, like a multi billion dollar market is just going to disappear. No, it has a massive following and a massive amount of believers who will continue to support it. Its worth what we make it worth.
They are either poor
shit traders and lost money
shit people in general
Or no coiners who just want everyone to be as angry at life as they are because they dont have the balls to HODLLLL
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:18:20

@_date: 2018-03-09 05:37:43
WHomever it is, is keeping the price at a range after they dump. kept it at 9800 then 9300 now 8600 it never leaves those ranges no matter what.   Then every 12 hours or so, they dump it
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:38:29
Gonna bounce off that big ass 9k wall though
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:54:25

@_date: 2018-02-21 16:45:34
They will sell, take profit. then pump back in
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:07:21

@_date: 2018-04-13 23:17:48
I love the little fudsters on here with little baby balls who start crying and cheering dips because they couldnt find those little baby balls to buy at the dip. At this point i get more joy watching you cry and buy late then making money.
