Disappointing little 0.027BTC left. What price would you ask? Do you have a Blockchain account?

Ahh, sweet! Thanks!

Hey, thanks! Does Amazon accept Bitcoin?

As far as I'm aware, China has 6 large Bitcoin farms. These are all the size of 2 or 3 storey buildings. They have shelves in these buildings, holding hundreds of stacked up Antminer ASIC miners. I'm not sure whether they run pools but these guys make 20-25BTC per day, per farm. Their power bill is roughly $80,000 per farm per month, from what I heard. Saw a 5 minute clip about them published late last year. They contribute a pretty large portion of the world's hashing power.

Any suggestions for a reliable exchange?

That's pretty high, isn't it? I've done online transactions for fees that were about 2.5%. Do you plan to lower those fees later?

I think they're slightly conservative as well. China controls a pretty large portion of Bitcoin mining power - if some kind of restriction happened it'd be a massive spanner in the works for us.

All Blacks for the win.

ah, well, shit.

Is this actually legit? Starbucks accepted Bitcoin?
Or is this just an April Fool's thing? Cause it's the 2nd already. Not a funny joke.
