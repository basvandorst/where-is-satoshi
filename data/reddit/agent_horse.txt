it was cheap and available, most of the others were country names.

Hay, that's not nice.

Hay, this seems derivative.

No, it does not. There are still 15 functionaries in the liquid network.

The conditions for the 2 of 3 key being able to spend the outputs have been met on several occasions, some outputs with very high values remained unspent for more than 21 days (exceeding the 2016 block condition in the script).
This output of 3.35 BTC owned by Liquid was spent after 2989 confirmations.

Bitcoin miners aren't holding the keys to a 11 of 15, or 2 of 3 multisig. A majority of miners can not steal unilaterally from your wallet, but functionaries in a federated side chain can. The two are not even even remotely comparable as a security model. 
I'm surprised you would be encouraging people to trust without any sort of verification.

For "full node" to be meaningful, naming who runs the Liquid functionaries would help. Currently the software allows you to validate that money is being held by 11 of 15 anonymous parties, or 2 of 3 anonymous parties depending how the script is interpreted.
