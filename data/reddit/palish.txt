Where is the "Omg" coming from?
Are you surprised that your money could have been fucking swiped out from under your nose at any time by someone with a bit of skill?
This is absolutely why I tell people to use core. Don't use shit knockoff wallets with fancy convenience features.
No one listens, including me. But at least I'm aware this is insane.
Welcome to the ride.
 
BTW, Tavis is a fucking monster. And I mean that in the best way. He's somewhere between Jesus and Stallman on the scale of hackers, and he's done way more good than we'll probably know.
We dodged a bullet bigtime by Tavis discovering this. So remember to support Project Zero and to support the right of software testers to disclose vulnerabilities in products.
And stop trying to argue that they should keep silent when someone else's shitty work gets exposed. It's their flaws. Vuln reporters carry no responsibility. Stop punishing them for speaking up.
At least, if you like people like Tavis finding your bugs before bad guys do, that is. That's how it works.

$200? Well, 10x of $200 is still $2k, which would be nice no matter how it happens.
I don't mean to give you weird advice or sound like a fanboy, but times in history like this are very rare. The dotcom bubble was the last time millionaires were made en masse. If you have $4k to drop and it wouldn't kill you to lose it, maybe think about spreading that around BTC/ETH/Monero and then waiting 4 years without touching it.
That "Woulda had $200k" came from an $11k buy-in, back at the $1,150 peak bubble. (Yeah I bought in right at the top of a bubble, like an idiot. If I had waited a couple months then it "woulda been $400k.")
Do you see the absurd nature of the world? All of this can be both ridiculously insane yet also true. There's no way to know.
Either way, best of luck and don't lose your shirt.

This will not work. If you have millions in BTC, you have to watch your back. Some trader tried to say he was concealed carry. Big deal. You're gonna get jumped. Ever see a video of someone surprising you with a machine gun? It doesn't end well for the guy with a pistol.
What you have to do is to find a small group of trusted friends, then use multi sig so that two out of three of you need to authorize movement of the coins.
Alternatively, keep your wallet in a bank safe, and only move from your cold storage when you're physically in a bank, with all their security in place.
This is at odds with high speed trading.  Meaning people will not do this. Meaning they are vulnerable, no matter how they want to rationalize to themselves. They hide their fear with confidence alone, but confidence won't save you from the gun. Note that Satoshi maintained anonymity and then disappeared, partly so that his heirs could inherit their billions without having to face these concerns.
This means there are now several high-value targets walking around with millions, sometimes literally just stuck in their teeth. If any of you wanted to act out an Ocean's Eleven fantasy, now would be an interesting time.

A solid, thoughtful strategy. I'm impressed.
It sucks that noobs that put their $20k mortgage into BTC will probably do way better by default :)
Safety vs risk. I think most people know what it's like to be under the thumb of a horrific boss, so they're much more willing to risk their lives to avoid that fate than students who don't know how bad it could get.
BTW trade fees will eat into your $200 pretty hard. Be sure to take those into account. It's $20 just to transfer the BTC, because that's how high BTC's tx fees are right now.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:30:29
This is what we know:


less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
No one knows anything further than that. If they say they do, they are lying.
What does it mean? Well, you'll have to think for yourself and decide.
I'm not sure quite how the trade fees are determined, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was simply priority. You and Bob both want to send a transaction. Bob is willing to pay $0.50 more. You get booted; better luck next block (which happens every 10 minutes by design).
This system implies that there will be fewer and fewer lotteries to win, since there are a predetermined number of coins. That means the entire system will transition to trade fees.
Meaning we will eventually see a period where miners abandon bitcoin en masse, as they realize no one is willing to pay a trade fee that matches the current value of the coin. (The trade fee would have to be as least as much as the current lottery, since the current lottery is what justifies throwing so much computing power into it.)
This is the fate of Bitcoin. It cannot be argued, though many will try.
If Satoshi were still alive, he'd probably be stepping in right about now saying "Wait! I only put the cap on to increase adoption and give a healthy network with lots of mining power. We still have an endgame to think about. We need to remove the cap on BTC and make it a consistent 5% inflation per year."
But people think Satoshi would have said a lot of things. Either way, this is his legacy the world idolizes.
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:14:56
It's actually deeper and much cooler than that: the fee goes to the miners.
Who are the miners? They're the ones powering the system.
How do they power it? It's a worldwide distributed random lottery. The more computing resources you pour into it, the higher the shot of hitting the 15BTC jackpot per block. You know how it's a blockchain? That's because when someone hits the jackpot, another block gets added to the chain.
You can read about it in detail here:  but don't worry if most of it seems opaque. Lots of smart people pored over this and found few flaws. Satoshi had to drag us kicking and screaming here.
Anyway, the fees go to the miners because each block can only hold a certain number of transactions. That limit was reached. Meaning those who pay more, get to be in the next block. So you can choose to pay $0.05 instead, but your tx will never get incorporated into a block because everyone else is paying more.
Why not make the blocks bigger? That is a divisive topic in these circles, but two reasons:
1. Bitcoin wasn't designed to be a currency. It's a store of wealth. (Ignore the "cash" aspect of the paper and pay attention to everything else. The current situation is outlined in 6.2, trade fees.) For lightweight transactions, use other cryptos.
2. Raising the block size would be bad news for BTC long term. You have to store the entire blockchain to participate. It's already gigabytes. If you 2x the block size, that will grow it 2x as quickly. And then we'll hit the limit anyway and be right back in the same damn situation.
BTC was designed to operate this way, and it's still going strong. And it will succeed if people just *don't change it* and let it be rock solid. Satoshi planned for this. Don't let anyone tell you differently, though they will try.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:29:33
The coins are stored where you put them.
If you put them in your wallet, which you control, then you have nothing to worry about. Don't lose the keys to your wallet. Use the encryption that comes with the program. Write down the 24 words to regenerate your wallet in case of disaster, then store those words at your bank's deposit box in case your house burns down.
When you buy coins, Coinbase will assure you they are safe. But they're sitting on their servers, in their wallet, like a bank. You have to take them off Coinbase to ever be safe.
I did not. I lost them. Would have $200k now. Don't be me.
(Oh, who am I joking.. I would have sold them or squandered them via day trading, like everyone else. Force hodl is best hold. Maybe Gox will someday return 20% so I can recoup my initial investment at least.

You make some good points, but I'm curious: why is bitcoin frictionless payment?
Most people don't have bitcoins, and in order to get bitcoins people have to buy them.  Then they have to trust a service like Coinbase to hold onto them, because consumers aren't technical enough to manage their own coins.  (If they try to manage their wallet themselves, and they end up losing their coins, they'll instantly hate bitcoin.)
Then they need to copy-paste a wallet address into the bitcoin app, type in a specific number of bitcoins to send, and if a typo happens, they're out 10x more money than they intended to spend.
Compare that with  debit cards.  Right now any website can use Stripe to charge users money.  Users type in a debit card number (which they already know how to do, and have been trained to do for years) and there's no chance of confusion.
So... I'm just trying to understand, how is bitcoin a win for consumers?  It seems to me that it adds an extra step (consumers still have to type in their debit card number when buying the bitcoins) and extra risk (consumers have to trust a third party to manage their coins and not go bankrupt a'la Mt. Gox).
Apologies for taking the discussion in a tangental direction from the original topic. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 07:55:16
As I said, people are so aggressively against learning from credit card companies that I'm afraid bitcoin won't ever be too useful to consumers.

Honestly, their replies to this whole subthread have opened my eyes to how crazy they are.  They actually believe that an internet currency subjected to a 51% attack is better than keeping their money in a US bank.
Anytime someone is wondering whether to get into Bitcoin, I'm going to link them to this subthread and point out the kind of beliefs that are held here, and how far from reality they are.
It's as if they want Bitcoin to be a backup currency, not a true currency.  Well, ok then.  If the US government is on the verge of collapse, I'll start recommending Bitcoin.  Until then, there are very few use cases because it's so dangerous and easy to lose your money.

I think you're delusional if you think this is going to last for any length of time. :)
Bitcoin is a gambler's currency.  Always has been.  The incentive to prey off of others' groupthink (by placing a massive buy order, waiting a little bit, then selling) is far too strong for us to be seeing any kind of stabilization anytime soon.
Stabilization will occur after bitcoin becomes a safe way to store wealth, because until then, people don't have bitcoin on hand to buy things at a whim, which reduces the incentive for websites to support bitcoin as a payment method, which harms overall adoption.  Right now, there are at least a dozen ways to lose your money after converting your savings into bitcoin.  Whereas your money is quite safe in a bank.

"bet" implies an element of uncertainty.  This might sound strange, but consider this question:  Is there any uncertainty about whether MtGox will eventually reopen?
Follow the logic.
"Gox has lost a lot of bitcoin, and won't be able to recoup their losses."  To that I say: They've made &gt;400,000 btc in trade profits.  In the recent malleability fiasco, the worst possible case was that they lost... 70,000 btc, perhaps?  Their hot wallet couldn't have held many more than that.
"Gox has lost a lot of money due to government seizures and legal issues."  These have totaled to about $20m in losses.  That's around 20,000-30,000 BTC equivalent.  It's significant, but it still doesn't touch the amount of profit MtGox made in trade fees.
"They could be getting ready to throw in the towel and retire."  Why would they?  They make a profit on every trade.  People will *always* trade on Gox no matter how low the price goes, because there will be an economic advantage in doing so.  The low price in fact increases the advantage.
I challenge anyone to present a comprehensive argument of why it's reasonable to believe that MtGox will be shutting down.  What are the reasons?  Why are they logical?
Footnote:  There is obviously some amount of uncertainty as to whether MtGox will reopen.  My observation is simply that the probability of MtGox closing seems so small as to be a rounding error *because* no one has been able to come up with a reasonable explanation as to why MtGox would close.

The thing is, advertisers are willing to pay.  Users aren't.  Surely the NYTimes' ill-fated subscriber model has shown this.   People have been trying to get users to pay for content since the internet went mainstream. When the cost of publishing drops to nil, the amount that can be charged for content also drops to nil.
History has shown that the solution in this situation is to innovate; to invent the future.  It's hard to imagine what that will look like, because it hasn't been invented yet. But we know what it won't look like: fee-based publishing.

I don't think Bitcoin insurance will ever be an option, because if you're trusting your Bitcoin to a third party company, the only way you can ever feel safe is if all of their bitcoin deposits were insured, which is of course impossible because the amount of insurance must be equal to or greater than the sum of their total holdings.  No one is going to insure that, because nobody will pay out the sum total of all customer holdings in the event of catastrophe.  For example, Mt. Gox lost $600 million -- which insurance company would ever risk paying out that much?  And why?  What possible benefit could it be to the insurance company?  Is the claim that the insurance company could make more than $600 million due to such an agreement?  If so, how long would it take them to make $600 million?  Mt. Gox's lifecycle was just a few short years, and Mt. Gox themselves made far less than $600 million in profits.
What's going to happen is that Coinbase or some other unscrupulous company is going to offer "Bitcoin Insurance."  The reason it's in scarequotes is because it should scare you.  It's going to cover your losses in the event of theft, but *not if the company goes under*.  Bam, you're right back to centralization and reliance on third parties.  Except this time, if the third party shuts down, you're fucked, as all of the Mt. Gox customers have been.

What is it with people coming out of the woodwork and saying "well *I* didn't lose any BTC, so therefore Bitcoin is secure!"
It doesn't matter if you lost any BTC or not.  The fact is, there are a dozen ways to lose your money with Bitcoin, whereas there are very few ways to lose your money by storing it in a bank.  On average, bitcoin is *insanely dangerous* to whoever wants to get into it.  Want me to list all the ways you can lose your money?  How about just a few ways?  Bitcoin exchanges failing.  Losing your backups.  Getting hacked.  Having someone rob you.  Having someone watch over your shoulder while you type your encryption phrase in.  Etc, etc.
The fact that people here are so cavalier about a 51% attack shows just how little they understand the technical details of it.
Inflation "robs people" huh?  Then you might be surprised to find out that bitcoin itself is inflationary, and will continue to be for quite awhile!  It's only deflationary when it stops creating new coins.
EDIT:  By the way, what have you bought "hundreds of" using Bitcoin over the last two years?  I can think of one possibility, but saying it would be a little rude.  Suffice to say, there's very little you can actually buy with bitcoin.

I don't understand your question.  Someone who steals my debit card can't drain my life savings.  I lost money when Mt. Gox fell.  That wouldn't happen with a debit card.  Bitcoin ain't safe or convenient.
Maintain my own wallet?  Deal with maintaining my own backups.  Deal with remembering encryption phrases.  If my paper wallet backups are lost in a house fire?  Hopefully I have more backups somewhere else!  It's backups all the way down, and consumers won't stand for it.  A bank is way more convenient.
And if people ever do start maintaining large bitcoin bankrolls, they're at risk of getting robbed!  The larger their personal bank, the larger a target they become.  Not so easy to rob a bank, however.

This question reveals that you have much research to do about BTC before you should put any money into it. It's the other way around: how can people possibly be ok with storing their BTC on third party wallets?
1. Buy BTC
2. Keep them safe
3. Wait several years
4. When you want to sell them, do so carefully, and only a small percentage at a time.
It's really that simple, and that hard. Everything else follows from these principles.
There are a variety of resources for each of those points, so I won't repeat them here. They're fairly easy to research, and if you have specific questions I can help with those.
If you ever wind up in a situation where you're surprised, you have no one but yourself to blame. The moment you hand over your BTC to Coinbase, they are no longer your coins. You've loaned them. And if Coinbase goes belly-up, only fools will believe that insurance will save them. Especially if BTC has a couple more 10x increases. No insurance company would be able to underwrite them even if they wanted to.
If you're here to day trade, you're gambling. And there are many smart people waiting to separate you from your money.

This is why to control your own coins. You did nothing right.

Is $120k most of your money? If so, then lol.
You can keep most of your money off an exchange at any given time.
If you're sitting on 10M then yeah, not so bad.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Welcome to Mt Gox. Happened to me.
Hope things work out for you.

Yes, you use localbitcoins. Stop trusting exchanges and you won't get burned. Hopefully you'll lose your coins like I did so that you'll internalize this lesson.

Hi former me,
I went all in too and lost everything. It shook me for years.
You expect to lose maybe 50%, but losing 100% is a whole other kind of pain.
Then you rack up credit card debt through no fault of your own, because it's the only way you can afford to pay for gas and food. And you spend the next decade wistfully thinking about that $10k and how it could solve all your problems if you hadn't squandered it.
Good luck!

Don't spread misinformation. BTC energy usage was higher than 150 *individual* countries, not 150 countries collectively.

You're crying to the exchange to come start an investigation and get you your coins back. Wake the fuck up. What if there are no coins? What if the exchange's cold storage got cleaned out at that exact moment? Then you're fucked. And the only reason you're in that situation is because of **you** and no one else.
Stop drinking the koolaid where everyone is telling you everything will be ok. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Hey, have you thought about becoming a teacher?

Why is it unavoidable that China will get a return on their investment?

If you open a bunch of different kinds of windows, like 10 Chrome windows, 3 explorer windows, and a few Notepad windows, and then switch between the Chrome windows, pressing alt-tab won't take you to the most recent one.  Or maybe it's if you switch to the explorer window, then pressing alt-tab won't take you back to the Chrome window.  One of the two.

Nah.  Pressing alt-tab should switch to the most recent window.  Always.  This doesn't happen in Windows 7 mode for whatever dumbass reason, which killed my productivity.  Alt-tab goes to some other window in Windows 7 mode because it's affected by groupings, or something.  So I upgraded, was like "wtf" and immediately switched back to Classic mode.

You can buy Humble Bundles with bitcoin.  This is useful for children who want to support videogame studios (rather than pirate the games) without their parents knowing which games they're buying.
There are approximately zero such children.  But it's nice that it's possible.

Speaking as a graphics programmer, this is mistaken.  The GUI rendering offloads its drawing process to the GPU, even if it's only doing basic 2D effects.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:13:30
Surely I'm not the only one who sets Windows 7 to "Classic" style because I prefer that oldstyle look and oldstyle alt-tab behavior...?
It does look like a potato, but it's more effective, functionally.

Oh god...
Can we *please* make MoonCoin a thing?  Please?  Holy hell, that's awesome.
Maybe we could design the mining difficulty curve to oscillate in tandem with the lunar cycle.

That's wonderful to hear! I'm going to link to your story whenever someone asks about bitcoin's real world applicability in the future. Thanks so much for sharing.

Did you even try what I suggested?
I reached 1,100 tabs once over a period of a few days.  A single window isn't going to work.  I organize different research topics into different windows, with each window having tabs related to a single topic.
"Lul don't do that" is the opposite of "has more features."
