funny enough, I don't know of any other encryption method that can be decrypted without any special knowledge and a computer. Yes, encrypting a few words is trivial and free, and you can use our software to do it.

in this case, you expect to be the first to arrive to your backup after a fire. When you buy a revealer you get two identical cards, so you can create redundancy without compromising the seeds.

no good been fireproof when the fireman can take your coins..

thanks! just use electrum to print out yourself one in a overhead foil. The experience with the card is much better thou ;)

It is merged into Electrum, you can run it from source today ( or wait for the next release. 
Feedback and feature requests are welcome!

depends on your threat model. As long as you don't store Revealer and encrypted seed together you are good.

Release an offline tool to generate these types of images to be printed at home - that is * exactly * what we have done. 
It is merged in the Electrum Wallet Source code. 
We do not know (or want to know) your seeds, and we don't sell seeds - Revealer Zero is encoded noise. 
You can buy it from us and use it to encrypt your secrets. You can also generate your own Revealer in the plugin, if you want.
You don't have to trust us, thats the whole point.

you can get one at

it is only merged, will be included in the next release. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:16:37
Thanks!! I just updated the how-to page to try to make it more clear. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:46:30
just to be clear, you can use our offline tool to print out a Revealer yourself. No need to buy one from us.

consider how durable your id, credit/debit cards are. And also that you won't be swiping this around, but keeping it somewhere safe. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:37:59
stay tuned for more releases soon... 
the r_zero is very durable, just not resistant to fire. We believe in not putting all your eggs all on the same basket, no matter how fire-proof the basket is. The zero fights (technically avoids) fire with trust minimized redundancy. With redundant backups you don't need to worry about the house burning down.  
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:18:55
it was not released yet, but merged on the Master branch. you can find the source code under plugins in the official Electrum repository. don't trust, verify. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:41:25
sure, thats why they come as a redundant pair, like keys. So you can create redundancy minimizing trust.

We send you encoded noise (you can also generate it yourself and print it out on a transparent foil). Then you use this noise to  encrypt your seed. Overlaying the original noise and the encrypted seed the secret becomes visible.
This is for people who want a two-factor backup. Some people feel safer with having a single point of failure and making it as resistant as possible. Using our tool you share your secrets in two parts, that are individually invulnerable to physical access. Then you can create redundancy of the individual factors minimizing risk of compromize. Have a look at our "how it works" ( and "how to use" page (

Well.. do it first, then let us know.
There is no real incentive for us to make it non random. And, even if it was - you don't trust us at any point with your secret - In any case, it will be safer than before.  
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:57:33
well.. if I was the NSA or other authority there would provably be simpler methods to get your secrets than making a encryption tool available - with verifiable source code - allowing people to encrypt their otherwise exposed secrets. You porbably wouldn't be any better in this scenario with an unencrypted seed, would you? 
In the second scenario, why would we do that? it would break our whole business model. Revealer is a company created to make your secrets safe, not to sell personal data or scam people. You know, the internet is full of these because they are more rewarded than hard work. 
We chose the hard way thou. Ad Astra per Aspera !!! 
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:26:12
or use a Revealer for a much simpler sharing scheme.
