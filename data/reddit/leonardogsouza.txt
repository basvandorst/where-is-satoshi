Great reply, and it got me interested to do this among friends and family.
Now, when you say "Help the people to understand what they would gain, how they would benefit and how much cheaper it is to use cryptocurrencies compared to FIAT." can you point me to some material (video, website, etc) where I can find this to make it even simpler to people (like, let's say, a list of 5 benefits they would get from this, etc).
Funny, I'm listening right now at Antonopoulos on Joe Rogan...

I want to buy some bitcoins to invest, but is really hard to decide where to buy, what wallet use.. so many options.. can someone help, please? (I believe is not relevant, but I'm from Brazil)

I'd like to buy some BTC, maybe 10, and then wait for months (maybe years, who knows) to sell again. So, being someone who won't use it on a daily basis, what are the steps? I downloaded Multibit, so I have a wallet now. So, should I go to Mt.Gox, transfer the equivalent USD to them, buy my BTC, transfer to my wallet and then? I'm still confused about the print wallet, save the wallet.dat to a memory disk or the other options...

Thanks for the tips.

Downloaded and using. Looks beautiful, congrats! Will be waiting my BTC :)

The price is high here, so I buy mine on Bitstamp. But you can buy in Brazil using localbitcoins.com or a new exchange called BitcoinToYou

that's the thing, should I just spend this US$ 560 on an instant order (which will give me 0.74893818) or buy smaller amounts of BTCs? You know... I can look the Order Book and if someone is selling 0.007 for a better price buy that, and so on untill it reaches my US$ 560..

Just got it. Thanks!
