All you'd be doing is socializing the losses and pushing network transaction fees higher with that extra 100k tx/mo.
Bitcoin, in its current state, is no longer very good at handing small retail transactions and will continue to be a poor choice until we have a real scaling solution in place (and no, code that's sitting in a GitHub pull request doesn't count).

As a long-time Canadian bitcoiner, I've used the following exchanges:
* ~~MtGox~~
* ~~CaVirtEx~~
* ~~Vault of Satoshi~~
* ~~Cointrader~~
* QuadrigaCX
* Kraken
Joking aside, Quadriga and Kraken are both great. I find Quadriga is easier for most Canadians to get started with (due to both their simpler UI and large number of available deposit methods). Kraken is definitely tailored toward power users &amp; high volume traders, but is very compatible when it comes to exchange costs.
Taurus is also an option, although I have not personally used their exchange.

Look, take it from someone who's been in crypto for half a decade. There's no longer any hope of a hard fork happening (of any sort) now that the last of those actually fighting for it (for years) have been pushed out. I'm including developers, companies, and the users/rest of the community.

Early on in Bitcoin's life, this was how it worked but the team was much smaller at the time.
Sure, consensus-level changes can be put forward as a BIP but they won't be accepted (see BIP 100, BIP 101, BIP 102, dozens of others, etc). In Bitcoin Cash, consensus-level protocol changes are openly discussed and debated rather than being decided upon by a half dozen developers on GitHub.

One would expect that volume measured in BTC would be relatively flat, unless the service (LocalBitcoins in this case) is growing *within the bitcoin ecosystem* (which they are).
If the transaction volume is growing faster than the benchmark currency's inflation rate (USD in this case), that is very encouraging.

Last I checked, GBTC does not qualify for the TFSA or RRSP as it's an OTC asset.
I don't believe that there's anything stopping you from buying it but it could catch up with you later if you were ever audited.
[edit] I just did a quick test-buy in my RRSP and it does indeed complain about not being an eligible asset and may be subject to penalties.

Pick an existing business that can be improved with crypto and build it.
If you have a team of developers, pick 2 or 3 that you think have potential and follow through with the 1 or 2 that you see has the highest likelihood of succeeding. 
You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Crypto has a lot to offer to existing businesses/business models if you leverage its key strengths (anonymity, irreversiblity, automatability, etc).

I've actually come across this issue w/ Steam once before. The solution seems to be to make sure you're paying a priority tx fee, assuming your wallet supports it.
I do see others claiming that Steam doesn't wait for 1 confirmation but perhaps this is a region thing because I've always had to wait for 1 before they put my payment through.
@_date: 2016-09-22 07:14:18
Two reasons:
 * SPV mining brings the average down as those blocks typically only have the coinbase transaction in them.
 * The default soft block size limit is 750kb. Miners that do not change this can only produce blocks that are "75% full".
Blocks have effectively been full for most of 2016 thus far.

Trust me when I say that nobody has "sold" me anything. My understanding of Bitcoin and its history is very extensive.
The idea that anyone is trying to build an open source platform where transactions can be censored is ridiculous.
BCH took the risk of giving up most of Bitcoin's network effect to be able to execute a real fork after having tried the democratic approach for 3+ years in the face of real, palpable censorship at the community + social media level.

As far as the end user is concerned, the difference is significant.
The development philosophy of both projects is very different. Bitcoin Cash development is focused on on-chain scaling proposals with the primary goal being fast, cheap transactions.
Contrast this with the Bitcoin Core roadmap of relying on layer 2+ and it should be obvious which one will result in a better end-user experience at the blockchain (layer 1) level, which is what we're talking about since any Bitcoin-compatible layer 2+ solution can be adopted to Bitcoin-derived blockchains.

Currently, the only way to signal support for BU is via the block's coin base field. Earlier on, miners used the BIP 109 version bit to signal this but that never became a standard.

My intention wasn't to declare anyone as the "good" guy as the world isn't that simple and straight forward.
Unfortunately this debate has gone on for so many years that leaving out details has become the standard as there is just too much noise to sift through.
The upshot is that Bitcoin has been losing key use cases for years because of this conflict and people are very angry and likely very burned out (on both sides). Only one those two points of view is allowed to make its way to the top here, so it's going to skew opinion as it was unfortunately designed to.

Any miner can mine a block with any software they like and mark it with any version bits &amp; coin base texts that they wish.

The idea is that that risk is handled by the payment processor. Somebody paying with a credit card would expect to pay some amount more than someone who is paying in BTC directly.

Hashrate of the last day is used to estimate the remaining blocks in the period (light green section).
@_date: 2016-05-08 16:12:42
Yep. This is all what we're seeing at this point. 
We've seen other pools take notice but only a few are giving their users the option. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 01:37:18
Perhaps but it's also very possible that we're already seeing the effects of this now as [miners prepare for their revenue to drop by 1/2](

And here's my list of issues that prevent me from giving them a 10/10:
* No way to save banking information for EFTs, requiring you to enter your bank branch information every time.
* No button to "buy max" when you want to place a limit order with all of your CAD, at a specified price.
* Misc CSS issues at smaller screen resolutions (they're using Bootstrap so this should be dead simple to revise).
* No LTC.
* Interac E-Transfers are *very* expensive (1.5%).
Most/All of these gripes were a non-issue with Cavirtex/Vault of Satoshi.

I buy through ~~Cavirtex~~ ~~Vault of Satoshi~~ QuadrigaCX.
Quadriga's e-transfers are pretty much instant and their EFTs are free.

* Supports direct Bitcoin deposits.
* Private games are coming (very) soon but you can create your own tables if you want.
* Accessible globally.
* Extremely aggressive rake caps (if not the lowest).
* Withdrawals are instant, although you do have to pay for the Bitcoin network transaction fee.
* Provably fair is on the roadmap.

@_date: 2017-07-20 02:47:26
Not quite.
It's 133/175 as we are currently 175 blocks into this signalling period, which is 76%.

It's not likely at this point unless another 1-2 miners jump on board within the next few hours.
Just keep an eye on that green bar.

It was a contributor. The fee coinbase used was insufficient for how congested the network was when you attempted to make your transaction.

I would argue that anyone interested in the long term growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem would also be interested in finding opportunities for greater inclusion within the community.

We actually had this live and working on the poli page back in 2016 but it ended up being too easy to game if you knew what you were doing and wanted to be malicious (which there were a few).
We do plan on bringing this back but it is a lower priority for us at the moment.

We hear this repeated over and over by the same collection of 4-5 Reddit accounts, then repeated again by accounts all created within the last 2-3 months.
If you weren't paid to say this, I encourage you to help improve the site's content rather than making up stories about the developer's intentions.

You must have quite the imagination of you think that a service like that can be developed and maintained by a single person.
We receive around ~200 individual submissions per week and it takes time to process them. 
The only goal is to give the community the best information we can, in a way that is as easy to digest as possible.
If you see something that looks wrong or out of place, simply let us know and we'll do what we can to address it - but keep it respectful.
