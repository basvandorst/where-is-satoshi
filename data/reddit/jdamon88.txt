Absolutely brainwashed.

Or just stop fucking going on about it, on all sides. Nobody knows what's going to happen. If tomorrow it crashed to 1k for example, would you still be blindly saying "nah it wasn't a bubble, it'll rise back up again"

Partially, but the insane volume of unconfirmed transactions isn't my fault.

Ahh that really helps, thanks so much man! Really interesting stuff seeing the transactions in real-time, I had just been checking CoinDesk every now and then previously.

Relatively new here- what is GDAX most useful for and how can I learn to 'read' it properly?

People have been saying that since April, it's been up and down and hasn't reached 10k in over 6 months. This isn't 'literally' the last chance, stop being so dramatic.

Yep, my transaction from Mycelium wallet to Bitpanda wallet is still 19 hours and counting. Really pissed off.

For the last fucking time.
NOBODY KNOWS.

And maybe one day in the future when Bitcoin doesn't quite work out as you imagined, it will click that you just surrounded yourself with other like-minded people, all loudly congratulating eachother on how smart their collective decisions were.
I mean, I hope i'm wrong, but the blind certainty of people on this sub gets to me sometimes.
