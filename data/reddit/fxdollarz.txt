Way too long, no way I'm going to read all of that, but I'll answer your first point. I don't give a fuck what anyone hangs on their wall. All I stated was that the whitepaper is outdated and we don't believe in it anymore, we've moved on. The whitepaper describes bitcoin cash, so I don't understand the downvotes in mentioning the whitepaper is outdated. Very strange.

Your missing some key information here, namely account size. Fund managers are managing billions of dollars and at that size trading has serious liquidity issues. It would be hard for most fund managers to beat 10% with an account size of 10 billion, but that same fund manager given the agility of a 10 million dollar account would make astronomical gains. Given the size of most hedge funds, they aren't constantly trading in and out, but rather taking several un-correlated longer-term positions. Even Buffet who is a buy and hold investor has said he could make triple digit returns if he had to start all over again with just 1M.

Both schools have their downfalls, we know there are dangers if a fiat currency isn't well regulated, but there are also limitations on a fixed money supply.

Completely agree with bitcoin putting pressure on corrupt leaders, bitcoin gives the people in those places an alternative form of money where they don't have to trust their leaders. Crypto currencies are a great solution for incompetent governments (Zimbabwe, Argentina, Venezuela, etc). 
First world developed nations are very lucky to not have these corrupt leaders, or at least not as corrupt, as there is definitely room for improvements to be made. Even though I don't think a deflationary currency like bitcoin could ever handle the amount of consumerism and complexity built into our present day economy, I do think it serves an important role as a digital commodity that gives people the option to control their own wealth/ put their trust in something other than banks. At the very least it keeps the Fed in check as they know there exist other options for exchange of goods that are not in their control.
As for Yellen I thought she did a really good job the last four years helping the economy stabilize after QE, at the very least I think she deserved another term.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:04:42
Umm no. That's not how it works.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:57:00
Yellen isn't a dictator, there is a whole board - chosen by congress who are voted in by the public - that votes for the best changes to monetary policy as economic data comes in every month. The Fed's job is to keep the dollar stable, which it has done for over 100 years. People bring up the purchasing power, but that is an argument based on a lack of economic knowledge. Of course the dollars purchasing power will decrease as the money supply increases, but the money supply has to increase to offset economic growth and facilitate the increase in the supply of goods and services or you will have massive deflationary pressures, that's why central banks try to keep inflation at a healthy 2% a year.
Also most of the Fed governors are economists and have a background in finance. Their job is to objectively view economic data and vote accordingly. And the Fed doesn't just print money for no reason, the QE printing was necessary to  offset deflationary pressures following the financial crash to avoid a full blown depression, all those dollars are accounted for and the Fed's balance sheet will need to be slowly unwound as they contract the money supply.
The Fed is audited every year by the Government Accountability Office. It's financial statements are also audited annually by an independent auditor and results are given to the Office of the Inspector General, which then releases the results to the public. You can see the 2016 audited financial statements here 
The balance sheet of the Fed is also published every year. Here is the latest: 
I respect your decision to want to store your money in a form that you feel is in your own control, it's fine if you don't trust Yellen's ability to do her job but a lot of people believe the Fed is some evil entity with some sort of plot to enslave people which just isn't the case.

Gold isn't any more stable than any other financial instrument, in fact it's been less stable. Gold has been a safe haven - though it is a riskier safe haven - during economical or political uncertainty, but its not a great investment unless your using it to hedge your financial assets against economic risk.
Here is a chart - 
as you can see gold has lost almost half its value in the last 6 years, its value is highly speculative and is traded through futures contracts, derivatives, cfds, etfs every single day. I can tell you don't have much knowledge on this subject and you are probably going to remain ignorant. Gold's primary use is not jewelry, it is insurance against financial uncertainty.

That's true many in those countries only except/trust USD, but the problem is these can be confiscated/banned if a corrupt government comes along, In Venezuela they will seize any foreign currency so the people have begun to use bitcoin/crypto as a daily means of exchange. Although many in third world countries who could benefit from crypto probably don't have the means to access it, as most don't even have access to the internet, so USD/EUR remains the best solution for them while those places allow it.

As long as it's supply is limited it can never stop growing in value. It's growth will slow down, but it's value will always go up unless all economic growth comes to a halt. If a currency can't expand alongside the supply of goods and services its purchasing power will keep increasing. It's a terrible system that promotes stagnation.

Well bitcoin actually already does that. New bitcoins are mined everyday and the supply is slowly increasing and will continue to do so until 2140. If bitcoin were to theoretically replace the dollar, while maintaining the size and health of the economy, it would need some sort of intelligent algorithm that could increase and also decrease the mining reward in relation to economic data. Small changes can have a big effect as is evident from the impact small central bank interest rate hikes have on the economy. 
But I don't think that that's really necessary because I don't believe bitcoin will replace the USD, or at least not in our lifetimes. Bitcoin can live alongside the dollar as a digital commodity a completely separate financial asset, just like gold is today.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:55:38
I don't think bitcoin needs to replace the dollar so it probably won't be a problem at all. I like to think of bitcoin as a digital commodity that is much easier to exchange than physical gold. A commodity asset like this can live alongside the dollar just as gold can.

Making sure companies report correct information in their earnings reports and other public company information like net assets, debt, etc so the average dumb American investor doesn't get duped, hefty fines for companies hiring the wrong cfo. In fact  each year the SEC brings between 400-500 civil enforcement actions against individuals and companies that break the securities laws, typical infractions include insider trading, accounting fraud, and providing false or misleading information about securities and the companies that issue them. There's strict standards that companies have to meet to even get listed on an exchange, so investors don't get scammed. I don't know if you have ever heard of a circuit breaker, it protects average dumb investors from false pumps.

Except nobody would buy anything. Why would anyone buy a new house or car or anything really if it's price will plummet in a few years. Combine that with falling wages and the best thing to do is just sit on your money and slowly bleed out the economy until nobody is left with any income.

Imagine if house prices fell 2% a year due to deflation why would I buy if it will be cheaper next year. Or how about buying an iPad or any other thing not necessary for survival, you wouldn't spend as much because of falling prices. This would mean less employment along with 2% wage cuts every year further decreasing spending. Employers would over cut wages just as they are reluctant to raise wages today. 
If the supply of money can't grow alongside the supply of goods and services available then you will achieve economic stagnation. I'm not saying such a system can't work just wouldn't work as well as a inflationary system in a growing population.
 I'll admit that the current system can be run a lot better, the 2008 crash was caused by cheap debt, but that should have been avoided through strict regulations on banks, sadly the American people have been convinced to hate all things bureaucratic and like to vote against such protective oversight.

@_date: 2017-11-25 19:20:23
That's not true. A fixed amount of money will also be deflationary as the supply of goods and services increases. The fixed money would have to absorb the total value of the economy, which means that bitcoin will always be able to purchase more next year as long as we have economic growth.

You don't want to prevent inflation, instead you have to balance the money supply with the supply of goods and services. As a country experiences economic growth, population growth, and technological growth the supply of goods and services will increase. If the money supply doesn't grow alongside the supply of goods/services you get massive deflationary pressures; deflation caps economic growth and excessive deflation - hyperdeflation - will crush an economy. This is the reason why the US dropped the gold standard, the cap on the money supply couldn't handle the economic growth. 
The dangers of fiat system is hyperinflation, if a country can't balance the money supply and economic growth it has the potential to destroy the value if its currency. Although this is a problem with fiscally incompetent countries (Zimbabwe Venezuela etc), the Fed/ECB and other central banks with improved economic theory and easily accessible economic data have been able to keep their currency stable and hit target inflation facilitating economic growth.

If you have a problem with your bail-outs then you should be mad at your government not the Fed. Bail outs are not within the Federal Reserve's jurisdiction, the only thing the Fed has power over is the discount rate, reserve requirements, and open market operations (buying and selling dollar based assets). That's all.
Their job is to ensure maximum sustainable employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Those are long term goals, the problem is politicians don't think long-term, they only care about 4-5 years so they can get re-elected. That's why it's important to separate monetary policy from the state, so it doesn't get abused for short-term gains. Case in point Zimbabwe or Venezuela.

When you open a position in forex you don't actually receive the currency you are going long on. The potential difference between the currency you long vs the currency you short is deposited into your account when you close the position. It acts like a CFD in that way. 
I think your confusing converting currency at a bank with forex, it's not quite the same thing. 
BTC is also different from trading forex because you are actually receiving BTC which you can spend. So if you spend your btc when it's at a higher price than you paid then you do realize a profit in that way. Unless your trading a btc etn instead of "physical" btc.
