Pointing out a fallacy doesn't negate or win an argument. It's valid to point out that current policy is a continuation of the previous administration's policy. Especially since the Democrats are actively promoting the narative that Trump set up these detention centers. And the limited space and conditions are a result of Democrats blocking funding.

All the attention Bitcoin's recent rise has garnered has brought a lot of "experts" on finance out of the woodwork. Most don't see Bitcoin as a shift in the way money is created and used. Rather they see it as the bubble many financial institutions wish it was. I've been approached by two different friends with two different Vegas analogies imploring that I divest of at least some of my Bitcoin. 
So maybe there is a lot more selling going on as people are being convinced by friends and family that until recently didn't care that you had Bitcoins in first place.

How would Bitcoin have been affected if it had some built in measures that prevented powerful interests from building massive mining operations? Not that it could ever be set up like that but just suppose the giant farms never came about. 
Would it be possible for the same amount of progress to have been made if the bulk of the network was still on small individual set ups in the home or business using Bitcoin? 
Even if it had grown  to hundreds of millions of small business servers, personal computers and even cell phones? 
Or was the bulk of the work inevitably moving to massive farms because the math simply makes it inevitable?

That experiment just showed a correlation between children who could better conceptualize potential rewards for demonstrating patience and greater intelligence overall. It was not a demonstration of an economic model. The marshmallow would be Bitcoin in this comparison but the marshmallows in the experiment were not a model of anything in the real world. They were just a reward. The mice in the maze are not providing valuable research to cheese manufacturing. 
Always waiting for the bigger payoff is not a sure thing. If it was then futures markets would only have winners. Sometimes waiting too long to cash out leaves you in ruin. Remember that episode of The Simpsons where Homer held onto his pumpkin futures until AFTER Halloween?
Anyway, HODL but keep an eye on the technology and its adoption as well as the governments acceptance because those two factors and others that we can't easily observe will decide if Bitcoin makes it to the moon or not.

When they ask why is it rare, just say it's advanced mathematics that prevents people from counterfeiting it. 
When they ask how it can't be counterfeited tell them it has encryption. 
When they ask if there is a guarantee that this can never be counterfeited or stolen tell them if used correctly it's safer than all other forms electronic money but there's never any a absolute guarantees for anything ever.

It would be hard to buy one loaf of bread with a single gold coin. Unless you don't mind paying thousands of dollars for a loaf of bread.
But then again if Bitcoin can't be easily used to buy a cup of coffee anywhere during a strong economy with a working infrastructure, how hard is it going to be to spend it in a post dollar world during a depression.

The iPhone just hasn't done anything groundbreaking or cool in years yet the price kept going up. The customers that were reliably buying new iPhones every year started to wait it out until maybe the NEXT model came out. Then the next model was $300 more than the last model and they just started to say, "Fuck that."

How much gold do you scrape off of your $2,000 coin in order to buy a loaf of bread? See, that's the problem with gold. It's a means to store large amounts of wealth but there is not an easy way to spend it. It is not a replacement for cash.

They are somewhat aware of this fact as well. There are videos of interviewers asking college students simple questions about current affairs and basic knowledge that exemplify this. Some students goof around and answer stupid shit on purpose and some answer the questions wrong or incorrectly and just carry on with the interview. 
Then there are the scary students. When they can't answer simple questions they get really defensive and see the questions as an attack on them personally. Then they either verbally abuse the interviewer or harass them, even after they are done interviewing them. 
Younger generations don't normally fit in with the older generations no matter the time and place but the current political environment has resulted in open hostility for anyone outside of the youth culture that makes the counterculture movement of the 1960s look like a disagreement over where to have lunch.

I used to think that the twenty grand high happened too soon and it possibly damaged its adoption into the consumer economy. But now people are saying it isn't cost effective to mine at this three grand price or lower. If that's the case then what was the plan originally? Had the slower climb not been juiced up by that twenty grand spike last year would Bitcoin be dying now regardless?

 Bitcoin harms the climate.
Keep that in mind because as more green new deal talk is pushed by the government you can be damn sure they will stick a Bitcoin ban rider into any legislation they think will actually pass. It will happen suddenly after all the debates and deals are done and neither political party will object.
Edit: I am warning you all that the politicians are going to use climate change as an excuse to attack Bitcoin.
I mean seriously... Who's downvoting that? Do you all really think it's crazy paranoia to believe Washington will use the climate change debate to push through otherwise controversial legislation?
