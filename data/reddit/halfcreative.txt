The US government is not just one big ball of agreement. There are people in government that totally support bitcoin, and this Utah bill is proof

You're a very generous person, not sure why people would downvote

Hey, thank you for being so generous. It's great that the current standing bitcoin community supports a lot of tipping and charity. I can only hope to have enough money one day to do the same.

Can someone explain to me ow the Bitcoin's supply inflation affects bitcoin to me? I'm relatively new to all this and I'm sure I'm not the only one who could use an explanation.

[The Utah bill]( passing could mean a slight rise in bitcoin price, though it doesnt seem to be getting much publicity. Hopefully a major news source will write an article on it to give a wider range of exposure.

You must have a great bank then. Most people when sending money from one individual to another have to wait 3-5 business days for the transfer to go through. Not to mention most banks charge a fee to send to someone with a different bank. What bank do you use because I plan on switching immediately if what you say is true.

I feel as though trading across boarders is only going to get more prevalent as the Internet and the global community evolves, and honestly we should be encouraging global trade for reasons other than the betterment of bitcoin

I saw this and immediately thought what kind of asshole would make people give him money to talk to him, imagining my friends and family emailing me a Christmas card and receiving an invoice for 5$.

The channel has some great stories and interviews to share but they seem relatively low budget with pretty significant sound and visual editing issues. I hope that as they make more videos this will come naturally.
