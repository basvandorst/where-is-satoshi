if they solve a block with fewer transactions (generally smaller size in kilobytes) then it can propagate across the network quicker (supposedly) than a block with 1mb of data (or more likely in the future) since its a race to solve a block. if 2 miners solve a block but the network rewards the one most agree upon quickest, the lag to send the heavier block can be considered a disadvantage.

hey, print off some paper wallets for everyone to scan instead of wasting time sending to all 30. choose one or two to do a manual send to. encourage people to send among themselves. when you describe the addresses ;)

(if you choose to do sends at all) I see some people saying it will be to distracting. anyways goodluck!

The "Nuro" app is being tested which offers superior privacy. you input a minimum 20 character username/pass/pin and it hashes a private key from that as a brain wallet. The app stores no data outside of the phones ram. it interacts with blockcypher's cloud based blockchain api for signing skeleton transactions so the keys never broadcast just a sig, it never even downloads the blockchain and its very quick. currently works for UROcoin, is being expanded to all blockcypher hosted coins, looking at you BTC! (hint im a follower not the dev)

wiseguy  me on okcasino. thanks jerk that long was open for like 5 days with no movement. minutes before the dump profit was .01% minutes later gone!

Ah I do like that, best of luck :)

could you put the privkey qr under like a scratch card layer? if its scratched then the bills no good, until then it could be exchanged. obviously people could verify the address. theyd just have to trust you sold them a note which contains the privkey. then again it could be counterfeited so maybe im wrong.

read  sharing a wallet.
apparently my suggestion is frowned upon, sorry for false info.

  1btc, also someone likes multisig.

yeah not sure if it would work on all the services you listed. but if you can use the same private key that controls the same address on any device
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:11:21
you could export your private key and import it onto the other devices.

The should have hoarded these and keep the Silk road agent's coins he scammed from Gox. then with an interest in the health of Bitcoin they could run a campaign to increase the blocksize to eliminate chinese farms :P

In America with last year's (October) EMV liability shift every merchant accepting credit cards was forced to update their credit card reader to a chip/pin EMV capable reader or be liable for any fraudulent charges on a terminal not capable of processing the "dip the chip" type of payment. This required new hardware for nearly every business. Many businesses pay monthly for their terminal or are provided it free through their merchant service contracts. Even if it may not be displayed in huge words many of these chip pin readers are also NFC capable. Most major retailers, grocery shops and many gas stations that wanted to accept apple pay for that hype cycle ended up with NFC capable terminals. It was super easy to use Google wallet at these places. With Plutus you'd be able to pay with escrowed BTC at any of these establishments. this sidesteps (or complements) the usefulness of getting a "BTC Debit card" and preloading it with BTC.
