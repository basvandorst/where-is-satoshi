BIG NEWS
THANKS FOR THIS POST, long term, and what I'm talking about, make your game long and you'll be happy
99% of all who wrote here did not play this long game because everyone wants to get rich quick, well, look back and see the bitcoin oscillations
Look at the time between each rise and fall in prices, if in each of these ups and downs you make the long game you will be rich
Otherwise will come here next year if lamenting about btc prices
The media does not understand bitcoin, so love to talk badly about btc, fuck it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:00:07
The critics of bitcoin will die, but the bitcoin will continue with its persistence
In the future the bitcoin will be being used in space, the terraqueos will send bitcoin to the men of mars.
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:00:24
If you do not understand read, I used this as a comparison effect, if you do not know how to talk like man, save your opinion stupid for you.
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:42:08
I once had this phrase and I kept it in my mind.
"The ego is never and the best adviser"
And as in a nuclear war between the US and the defunct Soviet Union, no one would win, everyone would plunge into a nuclear winter
In this type of war between virtual currencies nobody wins, but everyone gets dirty with blood
The more time does not stop and the story proceeds, HODLING is what I expect and nothing more.
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:09:35
I'll sell for 18k, Hodling enough for me :)
I think that who sells for 20k will be selling to suicidal guys ( beguinners ) who think prices will rise even higher to 30k hahahhahahaha, at 20k prices will go south and some of these emotional guys will think of a rope to suicide themselves ((
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:51:23
When I see the media talking badly about bitcin and why things are going to get better
Obitcoin will always come up soon after going down
In the long run we will be the winners, a general media advice, study the history of bitcoin and other currencies to write about.
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:59:48
Long term you will be rich, in the short term you are a loser
However, I wish you good luck, HOLING for you too.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:11:14
Death dance (((((
Well, I guess the price goes to 3k $
In bitstmp the price fell to 3.638$ , I think the price will fall to $1.000, that is from 4.048 to 3.010/3.038, then there will be a raise to 5k, 6k, 8k, 10k,and maybe after the 12 of december, at the end of the year we can reach 15k or 20k again, and this my analysis
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:06:36
Well, it's state secret, I can not talk
I'm putting together bitcoins to create my startup with my own money
Thats all :)
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:08:48
Expect to reach 20 thousand and sell, if you wait to sell for 21 you will lose again
Buy for half the price in January and sell again for 50% in the middle of the year, buy for -70% in November and make the caviar party in December 2019
Good luck, HODL
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:57:50
Speak this on December 20.

2350$ is the limit of crash, later price increase
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:36:52
Very well said
I like to see this topic
I also like to see how emotional people react to this bloodbath.
The type of reaction that each man has here will define who will be the winner and who will be loser in this high risk investment
Good luck to all, I see you on December 20th, until the many waters will roll
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:33:15
Take the r out, google meant to say Bitcoin cash hahahahahahahahahahahahah (joke of course)
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:52:21
300k $,right?
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:19:02
It is not a question of fraud, more of the natural cycle of things, of the market, of the world, of the nature of civilization, and of a cliche of high and low life and death, a little philosophical of course
But things are this way
In some decades / centuries democracy will end and dictators have taken over the world, in the West we think that this world as we know it will last forever, and this thought that we have here, the more things change, this civilization will end in a few centuries , progress is not a straight line towards the future, another line in the form of a circle where things change having spring and winter summer, I see people, evolution and a path of ups and downs over the centuries and millennia
The same purpose applies to bitcoin and the markets in general, high and low
Think about it.

Today is the bear party, but you can not eat caviar
Soon it will be the feasts of the bulls, and the caviar and a free snack
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:08:32

This image does not correspond to the relationship, :)  because in space it does not exist up or down
The universe and quadrimensional (or have more than 11 dimensions as some physicists say with string theory)
No matter what direction you go, gravity will catch you, so I could turn this image upside down and it would represent the same thing

Well, I'm going to buy champagne for Christmas.
Good luck HODLERS, I was here last year, I saw everything, Waiting for the next BULL
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:16:10
Do not expect that bitcoin will get more stable over the years, you should look at the history of bitcoin, we all know how it works
Of course there will be fewer oscillations, but do not expect it to be stable
But finally, whoever wins the most will always be the long time treaders
This will be the millionaires of the future, I hope to be included in this exclusive list.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:18:01
Tuesday will be 3000$
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:13:07
Plan A
Hodle in a few weeks
Plan B
Buy in the big break in January (increase of stock)
Plan C (reservation)
Waiting until the end of the year, great things can happen
During that time, I'm going to invest an amount of money in my startup.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:36:13
Yes, this is true, air is very rarefied
Let's go down, refuel our rocket and HODLING, this time without stop on the moon, straight to Mars
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:05:31
hahahahahahhahaha,yes, yes.yes, yes, yes, there are a lot of stupid people out there, they do not buy bitcoin now, but they will buy when the price is 10k $
Is there stupid thinking? I do not think so.
I'm offering you gold more you do not want, I'm offering you bitcoin but you do not want to, so fuck it
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:11:32
I always say, people who forget the past are idiots
Who wants to predict the future should always look to the past, history proves this
There will be wars in the future, if you look back to the past, he will show what may happen in the future, civilization is a chain of cars and low, not a straight line of progress as Westerners, especially Americans and English think
Progress, civilization, evolution, wars, all this and cliclico
In the same way and bitcoin, if you look at the past, bitcoin will show how it will be in the future, more and more the price will rise, but will have high and low prices.
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:42:43
hahahahhahahahahha,yes,wel said.

@_date: 2018-11-23 18:01:13
I wrote about these cycles in a topic days ago
When the price of bitcoin reaches 30k it returns to 6k, when it reaches 50k the price will return to 8k the bottom of the well
When the price reaches 100k, it should go back to 10k or 15k
When the price of 1 bitcoin reaches 500k it will return to what many will call the bottom of the pit or death of 50k bitcoin
This is a very welcome natural cycle, if the prices just went up regularly without these few drops would have a chance to buy 1 bitcoin
Soon the price would rise again and fall deeply, and many will say again and the death of bitcoin, plus the bitcoin always reborn and back, and a natural cycle, nothing more natural than these ups and downs
And as civilization, ups and downs
Think about it.
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:54:19
LOVE BITCOIN
The rotten media, creator of fake news are always speaking bitcoin malco
When I see the media speaking badly of bitcoin I'm happy because I know that soon after the bitcoin reacts and the prices go up vertically
The media in general in all parts of the world do not know how bitcoin works
And how to say that you were infected by a computer virus, nothing more wrong than talking virus, not true 99% is a trojan, there is a gigantic difference between a virus and a trojan, but the media does not understand the difference and continues to call a trojan virus
in the same way the media from behind bitcoin when prices are down, they do not understand the high and low cycles of bitcoin and the cryptographic coin ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:54:33
Actually in Yakutsk makes -50
Yes, I love cold, the good supply of cheap energy
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:07:46
you're right.
this topic is for all people who bought btc when it was between 15k / 20k today they lost their investment thinking that btc would go up even more
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:47:52
BITCOIN=THE FENIX
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:06:24
I do not see this way
I am an investor in both BTC and BTC CASH and in the top 100 currencies of the market, I think you should diversify your investment portfolio, you will be able to profit faster
Roger watch and Crag writhg are 2 idiots, fuck them and their fucking egos
They only harm the decentralized ecosystem that we so much want
This ego struggle does not make things worse.
This is the best time to buy btc cash and bitcoin, think about it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:05:12
Yes, in the end bitcoin always won, it will not be different now.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:17:56
Waiting for 15k, HODL Path
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:56:16
Interesting, what is the logical basis behind this graph?
Well, maybe this will happen in January, or at the end of 2019
People believe in what they want to believe
We're expecting HODLE, yes, let's see how it all happens.
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:45:05
I hope you do not have any bitcoin in these HD
Or he will be very sorry
Everyone knows the story of the English who played a HD in the trash with more than 2 thousand btc
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:55:05
hahahahahahahahahhaha, yes, it will be even worse
here in the West not so much, but in Asia, especially in South Korea there will be many suicides because of the kind of culture they have.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:39:38
He is right
I agree 100%, after losing 10k $ in the middle of this year, I started to play the work long term, and it is already working
Yesterday I refused to sell my bitcoin and other coins, just waiting for the rocket to end of the year mars.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:21:34
hahahaahhahaha :) , funny ,Price was down of course
When btc reaches 3k you will only have 500 $ hahahahhahaha
Plus if you are HODL and brave will keep and wait for the raly of BULLS at the end of the year, 1k will be 3k, you can bet.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:26:29
Well, after the depressing winter comes the joyful spring (Holders)
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:53:22
I agree
Yes, it will be a recognized value reserve, but this takes time, until I hope to be a millionaire
For you Jorge soros, I'll laugh last :)
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:19:24
Fuck man, well said, you're a smart guy, Best topic of the week
HODLING FOR YOU MY FRIEND, you will have your BIG PROFIT soon
Remember to shop using bitcoin and other currencies, Also tell about btc in the places and supermarkets that you shop, this increases the curiosity of the people by bitcoin consequently the commerce and market will increase.
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:59:12
You're lucky to buy at this price.
Good luck and HODL!
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:02:22
so you are dead
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:24:12
I think we have similar stories
I started working with bitcoin in 2009 when satoshi was still working online
I remember accumulating 6.5 bitcoin easily, btc costing $ 60 and then it went down to $ 10
But I just used my btc to do business on the web, I did not save my bitcoin, if I had saved and collected bitcoins at that time I would be millionaires today
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:22:58
It will not be for the moon, it will be for Mars
And that's why you do not see bitcoin going to the moon hahahahhahahahaha
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:24:04
hahahahhahahahahahaha yeah !!,A+,A+ )))) support 1000%
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:14:03
I wrote in another topic about this price, yes it is probably correct
Coming soon Hodl

@_date: 2018-11-21 19:11:26
Yes, btc will arrive at this price until 2025
He is right, but many will lose money when the price is 500 thousand people will buy it thinking that the price had reached 1 million
But the price will fall to 100 thousand, and many will commit suicide hahaahahahhah
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:06:55
Yes, people think no, but history repeats itself
This time we go higher
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:44:06
You are a very lucky guy.
Remember to use your btc to make comprars etc, this increases our demand in the markets for virtual currencies
