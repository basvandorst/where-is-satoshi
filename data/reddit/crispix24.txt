It's actually very simple if you understand elementary concepts of supply and demand. When thousands of people have their bitcoins stolen from an online exchange, many try to sell or lose interest in trading altogether. When demand drops... so does price.

I agree, and the problem clearly has not been fixed yet... thus the decline in interest in trading for the time being. Most smart traders anticipated the pull-back which means a lot of sell orders on the other trading sites. The number one rule in trading is buying low and selling high and that applies to Bitcoin too.

Just to play devil's advocate, if Craig really was Satoshi but didn't want his identity known to the world, his act to make it appear like he's trying to perpetrate a hoax would actually be one of the best ways to convince people he wasn't Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:31:56
Google search the Wired &amp; Gizmodo articles from last year, he never claimed to be Satoshi until well after they were published. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:59:08
His name originally came out up in investigative articles in Wired and Gizmodo, at which point there were a lot of people who were buying it. So in the hypothetical case Craig was actually Satoshi, this would seem like the best way to convince the public otherwise.

@_date: 2015-12-14 19:49:49
Well that's a much better argument than saying "because Satoshi said so." I tend to agree with you for the most part, but I could care less about Satoshi's original vision. Bitcoin isn't a cult and there are many other developers on the project who have my equal respect. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:01:12
What's the evidence that this is a hoax? Wright has not admitted to anything. People want Satoshi to be this benevolent genius, when in reality there was most likely self-interest at the heart of Bitcoin's creation.

He's not claiming to be anything. This is all speculation at this point. But the book doesn't prove anything except he didn't bother to proofread it. Read John Nash and it will become clear you can't make intellectual assumptions about a person based on a textbook.

Totally agree, the whole concept of having negative votes on someone's comment is so 3rd grade. Seems like many people just vote based on the bandwagon so comments either get voted up to the top or down into oblivion. They have done the same thing in many other subreddits that I read.

Not saying Wright is or isn't Satoshi, but what makes you the judge of someone's cognitive capacity? That's what bothers me about all these posts assessing his personality. Unless you know the guy in real life, you have know idea what he's really like or what he's capable of doing. Look at some of John Nash's personal writing and tell me you can assess whether he could do groundbreaking work.

You seem really invested in this not being Satoshi. Why not have an open mind about it and see how it develops?

You're making way too many assumptions about Satoshi in the post. You don't know him or anything about his background.

The problem is that you should not rely on what other people find "worthy." You're essentially getting the popular opinion and not seeing the counter argument.

The popular opinion is often based on emotion and rarely ever accurate.

@_date: 2014-07-18 03:43:15
It's hard to believe this is for real. This is exactly what happens when bureaucrats try to regulate a developing technology of which they are willfully ignorant or have no care to understand. I can't tell if Mr. Lawsky really understands exactly what he is suggesting, but there is clearly a competence gap and residents of New York should expect better.
That said, if these regulations are brought into enforcement, I see no future for cryptocurrency in New York. Any existing startups will immediately move and doing business with New York residents would become considerably more difficult. And it would do nothing to stop companies like Mt. Gox like Mr. Lawsky cited. In case Mr. Lawsky wasn't aware, Mt. Gox was based in Japan, not New York.
I would just suggest to Mr. Lawsky that startups in disruptive technologies should be encouraged, not regulated into obscurity. Clearly industry titans like Facebook wouldn't have flourished if they had attempted to launch in such hostile regulatory environments. The public interest should always be at the heart of any business regulations. This seems to be an attempt to stifle one of the most promising financial innovations of our time.

The comments in support of this guy really astound me. He ran a black market operation that trafficked all kinds of unsavory items, he tried to have a couple of people killed (including innocent people who shared an apartment.) But we're supposed to want him to get off just because his black market used Bitcoin?

In a nutshell, the rules of the senate allow a senator to speak as long as they want once recognized, so a senator can effectively prevent a vote on a measure by continuing to speak without stopping.

Exactly. This is the elephant in the room that everyone is just ignoring. You can't just fork the blockchain because that doesn't solve anything and you still have the same problem.

Of course they're not. Bitcoin was never designed to be able to handle microtransactions and Satoshi himself admitted as much. The fees are much lower than any of the existing alternatives and will remain so regardless of block size.

There are also a number of rational arguments against increasing the block size that have nothing to do with learned behavior. Gavin has quoted a number of them in this blog post.

Let's stick with discussing the merits of one approach over the other instead of questioning people's motives.

I get what you're saying. There is no doubt he could end up redeeming himself in prison and becoming a leading voice for drug sanity. That would be a great outcome. My issue is with the "free Ross" crowd that believes he's the innocent victim of some kind of government persecution conspiracy. I think the guy has done some legitimately bad things and it's probably a good thing we caught him before stuff got out of hand. If he wants to turn things around at this point, that's up to him.

Well the problem is, it is normal. Corruption is endemic to our judicial system. I've been on the receiving end of it myself.

I dunno, I think there are a lot of uninformed people who choose not to vote and I support that decision. Maybe there should be a "none of the above" option that works similar to what you mentioned. There are definitely elections where all of the candidates are pretty bad.
On the flip side, most of the people who don't vote because they don't like any of the candidates seem to be mostly uninformed in my opinion. I'll sometimes ask if they voted in the primary and 90% of the time they give me a blank stare. Apparently they think the candidates are pulled out of a hat and have no idea that people actually choose the candidates through a democratic process.
The system is broken but not unfixable. I'm convinced if everyone who complained the system is broken would at least vote in some party's primary, we might actually be a majority. There is usually at least one non-status quo guy running in the primary but he never gets any votes. I actually think "that guy" would get the most votes if people actually showed up but they never do.

But the version of civil unions that Paul supports is exactly the same as gay marriage, "equal under the law" in his own words. So again, you're arguing about semantics. The state has nothing to do with the tradition and symbolism of marriage, they just give you a piece of paper and that's it.

Never quite understood this line of thinking. It always seems to be the people most dissatisfied with the current status quo who don't vote, practically ensuring that the status quo will remain the same. Even if the election turnout was just 1% of the population, it would still be considered legitimate under the current laws. However if those 99% actually voted for someone who would change said laws, it would actually make a difference.

He wrote about it himself in his own journal. It's in his own words.

Except that statement isn't true. Ross isn't a non-violent drug offender. He tried to have several people killed, in one case the unsuspecting roommates of one of his targets. I don't think people should be in jail for drug use, but this guy should be locked away permanently.
@_date: 2015-09-28 08:38:52
That's true and even more so nowadays. I read somewhere that only 36% of the public voted in the last election cycle. That means roughly 1/5 of the population voting as a group would be able to control national politics, for better or for worse.
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:51:44


It does matter because he's claiming a nonviolent drug offender when that's not true. Btw he did try to hire a hitman to kill some people, including innocent roommates. He wrote about it in his journal.

Honestly, if anything happens to the economy between now and 2016 like it did in 2008, the "what should we call gay marriage" issue will vanish instantly from the radar of most voters. It's just that the country is doing well enough that people start voting on wedge issues instead of important stuff.

The free market will take care of that, man. Don't you get it? Everyone knows life would be so much better if that pesky government stopped harassing corporations for things like quote, "money laundering" and "embezzlement."

He claimed he was going to stop working on Bitcoin-related projects after Bitcoinica, but apparently he couldn't resist getting in a few more scams.

Those statements are not inline with my personal beliefs either. But to be fair, those two issues are like the litmus test for the social conservatives. I don't think you can win the nomination without social conservatives, and now I think Paul actually has a good chance of winning.

Wow. I'm surprised this is even legal. How bad is the Greek political system that the politicians think they can do this and not face repercussions?

I use Bitcoin for online payments all the time and find it much easier and more secure than using a credit card. It's clearly superior as a consumer payment system. BitPay hasn't seen the kind of growth they expected but that's a far cry from saying it's dead.

Down voted for telling the truth, that's why I stopped reading this sub long ago.

I couldn't have said it better myself. I had to rethink whether Bitcoin is ready for mainstream long ago when I realized even the early adopters were gullible enough to fall for every scam in the book multiple times. It's one thing to understand how technology works, and another to have some hint of common sense about managing your money.

I don't think we've hit the bottom yet. It's hard to say where that will be, but I would look for some steady gains before getting back into holding bitcoin.

Especially to those who bought coins around the ~ $10 mark, or even earlier.

It's only lost value if you bought at the wrong time. Most of us have seen Bitcoin increase in value versus the dollar for the time we've had it.

A government is as corrupt as the public allows them to be. We have an extremely tolerant public especially in the US who don't seem to mind corruption in the officials they elect, let alone the unelected bureaucrats that actually run the government.

Yeah, they tried doing that in China. Heard it worked out really well.

This seems like pretty good evidence against Wright being Satoshi. Unless there's another explanation for this but I can't think of one.
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:31:54
I agree it's tough to imagine a scenario where politicians relinquish their control over monetary policy. It couldn't happen overnight, but those elected in the aftermath of the debt crisis might see the appeal in a fixed currency, where governments are forced to spend only what they take in. In the interim, I could see them using a managed exchange rate with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to keep some leverage over the economy.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:21:50
Unless Satoshi is more than one person, or there are multiple Satoshi's controlling different accounts. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:55:38
It strikes me as strange that he says he could be wrong... if I witnessed someone signing a message with the private key from block  I would be pretty confident that was the real Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:31:36
Interesting theory.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:37:25
I'm kind of disappointed. It was entertaining enough that I was hoping he would keep it going for a while longer so we could see how long people would keep backing him. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:37:35
I think you follow what I'm saying. He's using language that leaves the door open for doubt, which makes me think he's not as convinced as he claims to be.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:58:29
Maybe he's waiting for people to make fools out of themselves claiming they know one way or the other, before making a transaction from the genesis block to prove them wrong. Sounds like something that Satoshi would do.
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:20:26
That might be the coolest thing I've ever seen. But is it officially licensed by Midway or is it just a hack?

"Court Approves Police to Steal Nearly $20,000" &lt;- There, I fixed the title for you. I don't understand why people are trying to avoid using the term theft just because law enforcement are the thieves in this case. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:37:59
I don't necessarily disagree. If it was legal to mint your own currency then there would be no issue. Or if the new money was distributed evenly, although in many ways that might defeat the purpose of debasing the currency.
@_date: 2016-05-11 18:35:16
Gavin is really starting to look like Peter Todd these days, it's uncanny.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:16:33
That actually exposes an interesting point. Do we really know for sure the person who posted the Bitcoin white paper is the same person who's been posting on Bitcoin talk, etc. Couldn't anyone who read the whitepaper have grabbed the name and assumed his identity?
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:06:03
His post refers to a number of individuals as the "Satoshi Nakamoto team" including Dave Kleiman. Now I'm curious who else might have been on this team.

Seems very suspicious. And you just found this package sitting in your home folder on Kubuntu? At the very least I would want to find out how that file made it's way onto your machine.

No kidding, people there are saying Craig Wright got hacked and a hacker posted this message. There's literally no straw they won't grasp. It's impossible for them to admit that Gavin was duped.
@_date: 2016-05-09 16:55:50
At least he's telling the truth. How often do you hear the mainstream media talk about this?
@_date: 2016-05-03 07:13:57
I'd actually be more inclined to believe he was Satoshi if he hadn't made the blog post with the fake proof. It would have seemed more believable if he had just kept quiet.
@_date: 2015-03-01 04:13:24
Doesn't change the fact that it's theft. Just because it can pad the pockets of a few select people, doesn't make it otherwise.
@_date: 2015-03-16 23:53:51
Not everyone is so hyper-obsessed with anonymity. Bitcoin has some nice use cases when you want to see where your Bitcoin came from.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:53:31
I think he is saying that the people who are constantly falling for every scam in the book and ignoring common sense on exchanges like Gox are making for bad headlines for Bitcoin when they inevitably lose their coins. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:44:01
Sometimes I think more people are here for the drama than the actual currency.
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:31:28
It benefits some more than others. Taking from one person to give to another is theft, not hyperbole.
@_date: 2016-05-03 07:20:22
I agree with you now after reviewing the blog post in detail. Amazing that Gavin and Matonis were both duped.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:22:45
I have been following the Bitcoin community for several years and I'm convinced people will never stop being scammed. For every scam that gets taken down, people always seem to be willing to hand over their coins to the next one that pops up. It has a way of making you pessimistic about the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:43:02
That's the problem with these kind of discussions. Most of the armchair engineers here don't seem to actually understand how the blockchain works. The transaction volume has been many times higher than it is currently and there were no problems.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:28:05
That's quite a claim. I'm sure you will follow-up with evidence that Gavin is assisting his writing... I'm sure you wouldn't just be making stuff up, only trolls do that.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:11:54
According to Gavin it was validated on a factory-sealed computer. Just saying I find his noncommittal language to be strange if this is indeed the case.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:18:12
He never claimed that, and even if he did, would it even matter? Wright doesn't seem to be particularly respected in the Bitcoin community if this sub is any representation.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:56:22
By that last point Wright did a service to the Bitcoin community in many ways.

A friend of mine owns a local restaurant and chargebacks happen more often than you think. It's annoying but most merchants consider it the cost of doing business.

I'm reserving judgement because I have a lot of respect for Gavin and some of the others who have verified his identity, but that blog post does have me scratching my head.
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:11:06
So basically, the author is saying the reason Greece shouldn't switch to Bitcoin is because they wouldn't be able to steal from people's bank accounts by devaluing their currency. Sound logic.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:13:08
I agree with the statement, but in general I don't think it matters. It should be up to the jury to decide what testimony is relevant, not an unelected bureaucrat who is trying to throw the case.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:52:21
Sure. If we trust the concept of trial by jury, we should expect the jury to make the judgement of what's relevant. Otherwise, we're treating the jury like children that need to be restricted from hearing this or that.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:52:51
It really doesn't matter what Satoshi supported or didn't support. He's gone and Bitcoin has developed significantly since then. His opinion is no longer relevant at this point.
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:22:57
I''m shocked this is even legal. For an unelected bureaucrat to start concocting absurd regulations that Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg would not have been able to meet. How in the world does he think this is going to help startups?

There have been quite a few Bitcoin CEOs dying recently. I smell a conspiracy.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:50:11
I'm reserving judgement until we get more information, but  to pull this off Wright would have to be one of the top con artists of all time, an act that is almost as impressive as him being Satoshi on it's own.
@_date: 2016-07-31 22:51:43
That is a strong argument for voting Johnson just on it's own. But at the very least, he's a candidate in all 50 states, he deserves to be included in the debates.

You would be surprised how much that being on a jury empowers you to not to be blinded by emotion and to actually look at the facts of a case.

You're not the only one, believe me. For every story where someone got rich on Bitcoin, there are ten stories like yours. Don't give up on investing, just do your homework and know when to get out. It's better to cut your losses early instead of HODLing all the way to broke.

I've been following Ron Paul since his second or third congressional run in the 90s, he's been saying the exact same thing about the inflation bubble is just about to burst for the last 30 years. At this point who is to say it can't go another 30 years? Nobody knows when or if these kinds of things will really happen.
