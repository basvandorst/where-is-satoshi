For businesses converting the old legacy system to support SegWit is a completely separate issue from supporting the LN. They would anyway be using a completely separate wallet for LN, which will use SegWit. Of the work required to integrate LN transactions to some service, literally 0% is becoming somehow SegWit ready everywhere.
In fact I predict that there will be some services that support LN, but don't support SegWit for on-chain transactions. That said, obviously services should try to support both.

On [BOLT 4 spec]( a packet structure is described, where they define "amt_to_forward" for each hop separately. And:
"amt_to_forward: The amount, in millisatoshis, to forward to the next receiving peer specified within the routing information.
This value amount MUST include the origin node's computed fee for the receiving peer. When processing an incoming Sphinx packet, along with the HTLC message that it is encapsulated within, if the following inequality doesn't hold, then the HTLC should be rejected; as this indicates a prior hop has deviated from the specified parameters:
incoming_htlc_amt - fee &gt;= amt_to_forward
Where fee is either calculated according to the receiving peer's advertised fee schema (as described in BOLT 7) or is 0, if the processing node is the final node."
Also with [channel update message]( you can set a fee per channel.

Block rewards are subsidising network security, not transaction costs. 
If we didn't have block rewards today, transactions would still be processed, and fees would not be much different than today. Certainly they would be larger than zero, and less than the maximum fee people on average are willing to pay to use bitcoin. 
The biggest difference is that there would be a lot less miners who could mine profitably, meaning that the network security (against 51% attack) would be much much lower. Blocks would still come every 10 minutes, filled with transactions, assuming anyone would trust their money to blockchain with so low security.

If we assume that mining hardware is going to always improve with time, there's always going to be a significant share of the miners that are on the verge of being unprofitable. It might be sensible for those miners to try to force fees up, rather than shut down miners, since the resale value is basically zero.
And especially in a situation where the same entity controls both new and old hardware (as is quite common with larger miners I assume), the most profitable strategy may be something else than accepting all fee paying transactions.

Thanks for elaborating my thoughts so nicely. Especially:


I've actually been rolling my eyes for ages to all the "decentralisation at any cost" alarmists, but now I'm starting to become one myself. Humans are highly susceptible to lobbying, and as long as you can target 10 people to change the direction of majority of mining power, Bitcoin is in real danger. I'm not saying that the current big miners don't have the best interests of Bitcoin in mind, but humans are humans, and who's going to be there in 10 years? 
While it certainly would not eliminate the problem, I would rest much easier, if the mining power was spread more evenly. There's really no other line of defence.

Well the full RBF vs opt-in RBF is a totally different argument, and I don't know why you are making that point here?
My point was that in the context of opt-in RBF, it would be a nice idea for a wallet to have a way to send a replace transaction in a way that it can't be replaced again in a way that RBF transaction can. And that accepting this final replace transaction without confirmations is as safe or unsafe as accepting a normal transaction without confirmations.
Or do you disagree with some specific point?
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:14:53
Sure you can try to send an RBF transaction, but nodes implementing the opt-in RBF would just ignore any RBF transaction trying to double spend a normal transaction. Once you use some outputs in a normal transaction, they can't be used in an RBF transaction. 
You can double spend an RBF transaction with a normal transaction, but you can't double spend a normal transaction with an RBF transaction. That's my understanding anyway. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:39:06
Not every user needs to have their tx confirmed in the next block, and those would not bother to bid until necessary. 
90% of the practical problems caused by full blocks come from the inability to prioritise the tx queue. Wide availability of RBF and CPFP would fix this. Those willing to pay the most get to the next block, and not those who managed to guess a high enough fee in advance.
@_date: 2016-01-23 20:14:15
Well the point here was that "The 0-conf security of this "committed" transaction is the same as with normal non RBF transactions", which is not very much. However people seem to want to pretend that it is, and I was just pointing out that you can "upgrade" the 0-conf security of the opt-in RBF transaction to the same (low) level as normal transaction by "committing" it.
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:13:18


Well if the older replaceable tx's have already been replaced with an unreplaceable tx, the only tx that nodes would have in the mempool is the normal unreplaceable transaction, and trying to double spend that transaction would fail, RBF or no. I don't claim to have a perfect understanding of it, but it seems pretty straightforward to me. Somebody smarter can correct me.

Well that's because 2MB HF has nothing else to offer than a bad scaling solution, so if you are comparing SegWit and 2MB HF, you have to talk about scaling. So I think it's fair to say that "2MB hard fork is not currently required, because SegWit does with a soft fork what 2MB hard fork tries to do", without thinking that SegWit alone is a scaling solution.

Any group or individual can fork Bitcoin with whatever rules they want at anytime. If that group happens represent majority of hash power, it doesn't make a fork any more "not fork".
If you want to make a hard fork without the forked chain not being an altcoin, you need have every part of Bitcoin economy agree that the new fork is the Bitcoin. It's extremely obvious, that this kind of an agreement is impossible in the current climate, and as long as that's true, you don't get to hard fork and call the forked chain Bitcoin. Period.

Softforks don't really need economic support. They only need majority PoW. A 51% miner majority can start enforcing any soft forking consensus rules any time without asking permissions, or even telling what the new rules are. They just have to be compatible with the current rules.
Many soft forks of course don't make much sense without economic support.
Your 0.5MB fork doesn't create a split in the chain at all, since all nodes would forever consider 0.5MB blocks valid, so no "altcoins". Everyone is under one ledger.

Content of the hard fork proposal is not the issue. It could be a change to 1.01MB blocks for all I care or something else completely uncontroversial. It's the way it's being forced on the community with social engineering and politics with a ridiculously low activation threshold of 75%. If successful, it would signal at least a temporary failure of the bitcoin experiment for me and many others, as it would show that bitcoin community crumbles at the first sign of political pressure.

Uh, in another [thread]( people have concerns about receiving transactions in a hard fork situation, where there's two active forks, and transactions may or may not be valid on both chains. You have this to say:


So in your opinion it's reasonable to ask people who "just accept bitcoin, and that's it" to be aware of a hard fork happening, and have a system where they are tracking coins on both forks, and verifying that the coins they are about to receive are valid on both? But then it's unreasonable to check for an extra "opt-in RBF" flag in a transaction. Double standards much?

The biggest change in adoption will come after Bitcoin Core is shipped with a SegWit wallet. A lot of businesses are waiting for a drop-in replacement for bitcoind, so they don't have to jump through any extra hoops for SegWit support.

I promise you that a lot of them are doing exactly that. 
If you don't _need_ to use raw tx for some other reason, you are better of just using core as a black box for receiving and sending BTC. Your QA is unlikely to be better than what Core does anyway, and you expose yourself to massive risks, if you cook up a custom TX creation routine  when moving thousands of bitcoins per day. I'm not saying it's super hard to do, and I've done it myself in the past, but it's hard to be 100% sure that there isn't any weird corner case you forgot etc.. One less thing to worry about and maintain, if you can live without raw tx.
You can disagree with my rationale, and I'm sure you can come up with some good reasons too, but I'm telling you that that's the reality right now for a lot of businesses. Lame excuse or not. 
If you are right, 0.15.1 should not affect SegWit adoption that much, but I predict there is going to be a massive spike 1-3 weeks after the release. We'll see, yeah?
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:05:03
A lot of companies that use Core as a backend, are waiting for 0.15.1 to have an actual SegWit wallet support, so it becomes a drop-in replacement for them.
While you already can generate SegWit addresses, if you spend those outputs, the change addresses are still (AFAIK) going to be legacy addresses, which is not something you want. Of course there are hackish ways around that by using raw transactions, but that's opening a whole new can of worms, unless you are already doing that. If a well tested drop-in solution is around the corner, why bother wasting resources to develop your own?
I would not draw any conclusions from anyones lack of SegWit support before a few weeks after 0.15.1

But what if you are just interested in receiving and sending regular bitcoin transactions, and you don't need any extra options? Is it in your opinion still a good idea to use raw tx? As a business, what's the extra value I get from that for a cost of maintaining my own solution, if it does effectively the same thing as the built in RPC commands?
Of course there is plenty of use cases for raw tx, when you need to do some custom transactions, but what I'm saying is that most businesses choose not to do that, because they don't need to. If that is a sign of incompetence for you, then the world is full of incompetent businesses. The fact remains that all those "incompetent" businesses are waiting for 0.15.1 to upgrade to SegWit, as there is no urgent need for an upgrade currently.
If I'm right, there is going to be a big adoption spike during a month following the 0.15.1 release, and if you are right, it will not affect it much.

Small nit: the minimum fee that is &gt;0 is not 1 satoshi/byte, it's 1 satoshi/tx.
But anyway, in "blocks never full" situation, the kind of market you are describing is something that can easily work for a long time. But that requires miners to act in a way, that throws away some personal profits for the "common good" of all miners. While that kind of behaviour is possible and maybe even likely most of the time, it can't be guaranteed. What can be guaranteed is that some miners at some point are not going to be looking out for the common good. 
Every miner that starts accepting lower fee transactions than the competition, increases their own profits, but less than what it costs to miners collectively. It could quickly become a race to zero that is not easy to recover from. 
Of course this is a problem that could easily be fixed, if miners would form a cartel agreeing to a minimum fee! They could require registration for miners, and orphan all non cartel blocks. /s

They want to scale Bitcoin by hard forking for various reasons, some more legitimate than others. The latest attempt is BU, which is getting a resemblance of support from some miners. 
The problem with SegWit for them is that they are already falling behind on development compared to the Core (they are based on 0.12 branch AFAIK). If SegWit activates, they are forced to rebase their work on 0.13.1 branch, because once some big players start receiving SegWit transactions, they will forever refuse to run a hard fork that doesn't include SegWit (because without SegWit, anyone could spend those transactions). BU would lose any momentum they currently have.
So it's really a life and death question for the hard fork camp, at least for this iteration.

I made a CPFP tx today (with android bitcoin wallet). First tx had fee rate of about 35 satoshi/byte and was seemingly stuck. The wallet made a child tx with a 1000 satoshi/byte rate (:-O), but was skipped by three blocks (some unknowns, and BW), until finally picked up by Slush.
Would be interesting to set up a system to regularly attempt CPFP and RBF transactions to see what percentage (and which) of the pools support them.

I made two CPFP fee bumps during this episode, and both were first skipped by 2 or 3 blocks, until they were picked up. Sample size is very small of course, but let's say 30%? Pools that mined those blocks were Slush and BTC.com, so at least they support it.
I'm guessing that the problem is that a lot of miners have custom tx selection code, and don't use the built in code, which has CPFP baked in since 0.13.0.

They would both be altcoins by my definition, since the original chain dies. Question is, which one would the Bitcoin economy follow?
We would have two chains:
* One with a centralized bunch of miners who just attempted to unilaterally push hardforking rule change to the rest of the community, and an unproven dev team.
* Other with a new POW which kicks out "rebelling" miners, and allows (at least initially) a very decentralized GPU mining, and an experienced dev team.
How confident are you that the first chain would emerge from that mess "victorious"?

Is it?
AFAIK SegWit outputs look like "Anyone-Can-Spend" outputs to SegWit unaware nodes, which can be, well, spent by anyone. After SegWit activation however, miners and SegWit aware nodes enforce extra rules to interpret those transactions, that prevent "spending by anyone", among other things. However, if a hard fork was adopted later, that didn't include those extra rules, those outputs would again be spendable by anyone, since there would be no-one to enforce those rules. 
That's why it's hard to convince someone who owns SegWit outputs to accept a hard fork without SegWit.
If there is an error in my understanding, feel free to correct me.
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:32:08
Well, every sensible wallet is trying to guess how much fees you would have to pay to get the priority you want, without paying too much. And with block generation and near future transaction load being quite unpredictable, eventually we will predictably end up in a situation, where a bunch of wallets guessed too low. This happens regularly regardless of the blocksize, as long as there is _any_ competition to get in to the blockchain.
So the only long term solution for the "I guessed too low" problem is for wallets to properly support techniques you mentioned (CPFP and RBF). Blocksize increase helps with the "fee is too high for me" problem, but not really with this.
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:41:21
The attack reduces to "if a group of miners make a hard fork, they can rewrite the rules so, that they can steal bitcoins from other users in their own little altcoin chain". Hardly an exciting new attack vector.
It's true that if you make a hardfork, that just removes the SegWit after the soft fork activates, the old clients will happily follow the hardfork, and SegWit clients will not. However, it's very very likely, that most of the major exchanges and businesses in Bitcoin economy will be running a client that enforces SegWit rules, so good luck trying to get someone to accept your "coins mined in a SegWit disabled hard fork chain"
@_date: 2016-10-27 13:25:14
I think understood just fine. The confusion comes from a different definition for the "main chain". You seem to think that whatever the majority of miners decide to hard fork to becomes the "main chain". Correct?
But what if majority of miners decided today to start mining a hard fork that (for example) allows them to spend any unmoved &gt;6year old block rewards. Would that magically become the "main chain"? No, because the rest of the economy would just go "uh, nope", and any coins those miners mined in that chain would be worthless, as no one would accept them.
The same logic applies with SegWit. If SegWit activates (with 95% miner support no less), and users start using SegWit transactions, any hard fork that allows miners to steal those SegWit transactions would get the same reaction from the Bitcoin economy. It just will not happen.
Users set the rules, and users pay miners to perform a transaction ordering service, as long as they stay within the rules, which are **set by users**.
@_date: 2016-10-15 20:00:40


I'm pretty sure any miner can include them. For non SegWit miner, SegWit transaction is just an Anyone-Can-Spend transaction, with some extra gibberish, which can be safely ignored.
So in a hypothetical SegWit -&gt; non SegWit hard fork, miners can just sweep all unspent SegWit outputs, and send them wherever. Opposite of frozen.
@_date: 2016-10-15 17:24:42
Doesn't sound right. It would be a hard fork, if old nodes could not validate the SegWit transactions. SegWit is backward compatible in a sense that old nodes see SegWit outputs as _valid_ Anyone-Can-Spend outputs, and considers transactions spending those outputs valid transactions, so it follows that you would be able to spend SegWit transactions in a non segwit network just fine. 
From [BIP-141](
"Non-upgraded nodes, however, will not see nor validate the witness data and will consider all witness programs as anyone-can-spend scripts"
And even if you were correct, point about owners of SegWit outputs not wanting to hard fork without SegWit would be still valid.

No, the reason non SegWit miners can't just steal SegWit outputs when SegWit is activated, is that SegWit nodes enforce extra rules for SegWit transactions, making those "stealing" transactions invalid. But if no-one is around to enforce those rules, Segwit outputs are free for anyone to spend.
But I don't think I'm able to convince you, so whatever.

This is one of the problems with these hard fork proposals. No-one with hard earned experience on writing consensus critical code for Bitcoin is working on them.
I mean do they really expect some exchanges guarding tens of millions worth of customer coins to make a leap of faith hard fork, with a code written by someone with zero track record of writing safe code for Bitcoin. I don't think so.
I'm not saying that the core devs are the only developers in the world, who can safely modify Bitcoin. But it just seems that all the devs that can, and want to work on Bitcoin, seem to choose to work on core codebase. As long this is true, I don't see an alternative implementation hard fork gaining sufficient support from Bitcoin economy.

But it's clear from the question, that the honest miners have not found a block between t-10 and t, when the selfish miner finds the block height N. So with that knowledge it's obvious that you can't select t = -10 as the point of reference, and the expected time must be t=15

One can only hope.

Very nice, thank you.
However: 


Also I can't figure out the RPC interface (which I'm mainly interested in) from that pull request.

TIL 273*2000 = 200000000

If it's a typical online wallet, that 500BTC would be just an entry in their local database for that account, and the actual bitcoins would have been used for withdrawals of other accounts, or moved to a cold wallet. You will need to search for all exactly 500BTC transactions from that time period.

Interesting, but could not find any info on this. Any links with details?

So it takes 273 **years** to launder $200M with one $2000 daily limit account, right?

Bitcoin didn't fork there. That event was abandoning an already existing fork that we did not know about before, which was exposed by a block which happened to be valid on one fork, but not the other. The "fork" happened much earlier, unknown to everyone. So instead of creating a new incompatible fork, we destroyed an old incompatible fork. Quite the opposite of doing a hardfork, no?
I can imagine that in the early days we may have been running with multiple of these kinds of "silent" hard forks caused by bugs or inconsistent system libraries etc. They have just been fixed before triggering a split (thanks devs!) But I don't think the act of fixing these kinds of bugs can be categorised as "look, bitcoin is hard forking!", even if that bug is exposed in a live system, like in this case.
In fact, it's possible that we are still running with some years old forks, which could trigger a split with some weird edge case. It's one of those things we can never be certain of.
