That's perfect then :)
In my opinion everyone should invest something like $100 long term, depending on how much money you can bear to loose in a worst case scenario, which might be unlikely but it's better to be safe than sorry. The chances of winning are so big, it just doesn't make sense not to. It's not like playing the lottery where you pretty much just burn your money (or pay a voluntary tax which is basically the same), you have a really good chance of winning big time on this one even if you only invest a small amount of money.
And I'd recommend to set a small amount of Bitcoins aside to actually buy something. It's fun and it helps you understand why a Bitcoin future would be a great future. Well, and if you want Bitcoin to succeed, actually using Bitcoin is how to do it.
If you don't know which Bitcoin app to use, try out Electrum, that's the one I've been using for the past six months or so. I'm not going to vouch for it's security, but so far I didn't have any problems with it and if you only use it for the small amount of Bitcoins to try Bitcoin out there is no problem anyhow. Couldn't be any easier to use (my dad uses it just fine, that's the highest seal of approval an app can get), it's open source, cross platform and even shows you the current value of your Bitcoins in USD or whatever currency you usually use. It's a thin client, so it doesn't need to download the blockchain, you can start using it right away.
You can also use it to create 12 words that you can write down or remember. These words can then be used to recreate your wallet from scratch. If you do remember the words, it's like having a secret stash of money that nobody can get to but you and you have it with you at all times, no matter what happens. Maybe you won't ever have to use it, but it's nice to know you could if you needed to. And even if you do write them down instead of remembering the words, at least that way it's possible for you to restore the wallet in the not so unlikely case of a hard drive failure ;)

I tried to withdraw 0.07 btc yesterday and it hasn't arrived yet, my guess would be MtGox has technical problems right now, which lately seems to happen regularly according to a quick Google search, so there doesn't seem to be anything to worry about just yet.

It's ~218,000 users now, growing by ~400 to 500 a day.
The following part isn't directed to you asperous, but to the negativity going on in here (and in general whenever app.net is mentioned):
To me, App.net is great. You pay $36 a year which isn't a lot for a product that you use every single day, and **you** are the customer. With Facebook, Google, Twitter, advertisers are the customer, so they don't work in your best interest but in the advertiser's.
But to each his own. It's great that there is choice. Use whatever you want. But please, don't just hate on it because they are trying something different here (making the user the customer, making a social network **for** users and **for** third party developers, not advertisers).

Mine weren't. And they never answered any support requests either.

Well, why don't you spend half of the money you wanted to spend on buying bitcoins now and if they drop a lot again you spend the other half. Then you're not going to kick yourself if the price suddenly goes up again and if it should drop a lot more you won't have lost as much.
Although in theory you never lose anything because so far the Bitcoin price has always risen to new heights again, it's just that sometimes you have to wait a year for that to happen. If you can do that, you're fine no matter at what price you buy in as long as you keep the coins and don't sell them out of fear. Everything that could go wrong already did go wrong and instead of killing Bitcoin, it always came back more alive than ever.

I had 13 bitcoins, bought them for about $80. And then I sold nearly all of them at $5 per coin because I needed the money. I would have had sooo much money now! But all I've got left now is 0.09 btc. Still, better than nothing and I'll save those this time! :)
