He should have added: they will also attack the messenger who points out to them their emotional attachment to their earlier wrong decisions.

I don't see how the two are related. Somebody's been smoking some good stuff this evening...

But if you treat it like a lottery ticket, make sure you spend the same as you would on a lottery ticket: up to $10. Then if btc hits $10,000 again, you will be able to take a lump sum of $30 and retire comfortably. Whoopdeedoo!

Yes, it's a great conspiracy theory about the big banks and how they destroyed your precious bitcoin. You have no responsibility at all for your stupid decisions.

If you search this subreddit you can find almost identical posts from people who bought at 10,000, 8000, 6000, etc.

If you want to manipulate the price of bitcoin, do it on Sunday when the trading volume is at its thinnest. So yes, just a bear trap. With no new money flowing into cryptos and many investors burned and losing interest, it's just another small rally in a bear market that may last for years and who knows where it will bottom, probably much lower than these levels.

but the 10% stake would have been diluted to much less than that by the ipo, stock options, etc, so probably much less than half of that.

Yes, 2018 will be the year when millions of people will eschew traditional investments such as stocks and bonds with centuries of proven value, and plow their hard earned money into an extremely risky, unproven asset class consisting of owning digital strings of characters and then trying to convince everybody else how great it is so that they may pay more than you did - a virtual asset that pays no interest or dividend, gives you no ownership or rights whatsoever and does not have any conceivable utility nor economic value, and whose very usefulness as a payment medium is in question (with the exception of illicit purposes), given the additional risk and costs that both buyer and seller incur.

That doesn't necessarily mean they are buyers. Hedge funds are short term players by nature, they could be applying many tactics, such as taking advantage of price discrepancies between exchanges, exchange rates between different cryptos, futures, etc.

Risk determines stability. I don't see bitcoin volatility going any time soon or in the future. The risk is high and will always be high because it has no fundamental value. One can argue that it is worth $1 million per bitcoin as one can argue it is worth $0.1 per bitcoin and they could both be right.

Those who buy on the dip are prolonging the bear market and in fact causing people to gradually give up. That means it can take another year or so until bitcoin forms a bottom - my guess is a lot lower than where it is. Granted there are going to be bear market rallies here and there that will all fizzle just like the latest one from $8k to $9.5k. I also suspect that once so many people have been burned, they will never want to get back in and that will be the end of cryptos - except for the "real believers" the hodlers, but it's going to be a niche market with far smaller market cap and almost no application in the real world except for a zero sum confidence game.

Yes, he said that about stocks. If you want to quote Buffett, you must also consider what he said about cryptos.

Dead cat bounce is over. Next leg down begins now. Expect $8-9k within 48-72 hours, where it will consolidate. Then it depends if they can find new buyers, otherwise retest of $6k level. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:55:59
That's assuming that bitcoin will go up forever from here. Just pointing out the logical fallacy.

I absolutely agree - hidden orders are a shady practice and are against the principle of transparancy. I was watching yesterday as the price was "stuck" at 8941 yesterday, even with massive selling and when gdax was trading 400 dollars lower. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:49:04
A few million dollars is not such a huge position, given that it's leveraged and the daily volume in bitcoin is in the billions. But just curious: how do they know that these are margin liquidations and not regular sells? Are they marked by the api as such? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:48:57
Not to mention that even in a basic savings account that dollar would be worth well over one dollar today in real terms since dollar deposits pay interest.

Yes, by paying extra fees and taking extra risk that could be avoided by paying with your regular currency.

Could hit $30,000, could hit $3,000. So far we're in a bear market this year. This bear market can last for years and I believe we're more likely to see $3k than $30k.

Also, a lot of people got burnt, sold and took losses with the recent decline - they won't be back for a long time. Hedge funds are short term players by nature so they are not enough to form a long term base. As you said, only mass adoption can push this higher. For now probably sideways to downtrend.

In fact it proves that those who bought the album were wrong to spend the bitcoin.

This sounds and feels like an infomercial. Very effective in marketing a product but full of exaggerations, misrepresentations and outright lies.
