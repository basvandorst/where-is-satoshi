Mining with anything besides a wall of ASICs is not profitable for bitcoin. 
If you are really interested in mining there are many helpful websites.
Since you know your hardware goto whatomine.com it will tell you what the most profitable coin to mine is. It will take into account electricity costs and tell you what to expect daily/weekly/monthly.
Cryptocompare is another decent mining resource. 
Right now Monero is considered a pretty profitable crypto but with only one 1050 ti you can expect about  $30 a month. 
There are reddits just for mining. Check them out. Check out youtube. 
Starting mining is not very difficult. You need mining software a desktop wallet and then join a pool. 
After that theres a bunch of fine tuning that can be done to speed up the hashrate. 
Over time your hardware most certainly will degrade. You will be running it at near 100% for 24/7.

Please dont trade based off of my information though. Come up with your own strategies. I believe any significant dip will come at 20k. Pretty good analysis for this on the crypto zombie channel.

The problem with self-fulfilling prophecies is that everyone was talking about the halving and the whole year out thing, and the smart money started moving earlier, and the halving was priced in at 140.   
When it comes to BTC everyone was talking about the year out from the halving and its been falling since 14k back in June which is nearly a year early from year out of the halving.

if you bought 1 BTC a week ago you would have 1 BTC today.

Just in case anyone needs a more visual way to understand this. I made a simple line graph. [

if he continued to HODL from when he posted in DEC 13 till the end of DEC 17 the value of his BTC would have grown approximately 30x.

Please keep this jailbait out of the sub.
That aside putting 100% of investments nto one asset just isn't smart. I hope it works out for you though. 
Girls that will make an ultimatum for you are never worth it.

Have you considered a Bitseed or Casa node. They come pre-synced.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:54:48
Yes paper wallets are available for bitcoin. There are even some vendors that make very nice looking paper wallets with hologram covers for private keys.
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:29:17
Or maybe you could try to come up with something better...
