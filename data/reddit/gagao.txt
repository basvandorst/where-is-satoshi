Has anyone else gotten an email supposedly giving them btc-e codes? I haven't used btc-e in 3 years so I'm wondering what this is about and how they got my username (blocked out). Not opening the docx file.

Did you reply and have they increased your limits accordingly yet?
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:15:06
Took about 2 days for my ACH deposit to go through, but that was when there wasn't a huge influx of new deposit requests. So I might give it a day or two more.

No problem, and will do.

I was already logged into bitfloor.com and have 2 factor auth activated so I didn't visit any fake website. I sent the  BTC withdraw request from my bitfloor account to my wallet address, but is it possible for a 3rd party who has access to bitfloor to intercept this request and have it sent to another wallet address that is not my own?
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:06:45
This is not a market manipulation scheme, I am genuinely concerned about my account and bitfloor.

Yes the 2nd level of verification allows you to withdraw up to $100k/day and $500k/month while the 1st level of verification allows for up to $10k/day and $50k/month, which is the one I requested. However, my account still shows the default limit of $1k/day, so I'm guessing they havent processed my email response yet. If your limits were automatically increased after verification, then I'm guessing they changed protocol since then? 
And wow, looks like it'll be another week or two until my withdraw methods get validated...sigh.

cool story bro

Phew, thanks!

The max file upload size says 2mb but it actually only accepts much lower resolution images. So resize your png or jpg file to about 500kb and it should upload. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:22:12
thanks, this is good to know.
