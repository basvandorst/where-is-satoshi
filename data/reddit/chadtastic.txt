I can only see two different scenarios were double spend can occur. 
1) The only practical reason I would ever see to ever initiate a double spend would be in the case you believe somebody got a hold of your private keys. What you can do is propagate a transaction on the network with a higher fee and hopefully have it beat it to the Blockchain before the other person can spend your Bitcoins. This in reality is not double spending but it is initiating a double spending transaction with only one output that can be possible. 
2) The famous double spending that everybody thinks of which in layman's terms "duplicating coins". Now imagine all the worlds supercomputers combined into one. That in itself would not be able to fork the Blockchain (have enough power to double spend). Even if it was possible it would only lasts for 10 minutes. As a result, the original blockchain will be followed by the honest participants and the double spender will be left alone on it's own Blockchain.

Perhaps there backend has changed so much since Oct 2013 that they have had to do updating and testing before the product is ready for launch. Just a theory....

First off, you would actually have to spend probably around $400 billion in order to create enough power to trump the Bitcoin network. Probably not worth it to steal $500 from somebody. 
Second, Even if it was possible it would only lasts for 10 minutes. As a result, the original blockchain will be followed by the honest participants and the double spender will be left alone on it's own Blockchain.

One client of mine ended up having all their backups (network attached) encrypted as well. When it came to their deadlines we had to write letters to their banks and creditors explaining how bad of position they were in due to this. I got to see 15 cases... business records, photos, even private keys... GONE!!! Some of them did pay the ransom and did get their data back. Very sad.
