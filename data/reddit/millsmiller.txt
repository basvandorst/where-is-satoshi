so are we currently in like an upswing that will end at some point? It feels like week after week we’ve had a fat increase. I’m part of this new 25% of users so thanks for the advice. Also would you recommend getting out at some point? I’ve been investing a small chunk of my job earnings ever week (like 20-30$ I’m not afraid to lose).

Ok so in the little bit of time I’ve been here I don’t think I’ve seen a month where there hasn’t been an increase of some kind, unless I’m blatantly missing something which I probably have . I don’t know if we’re currently in a huge up swing or not because I haven’t been here a long time, but from what I’ve observed the the risk to reward ratio looks pretty good. Like I said I’m uniformed and I don’t wanna seem ignorant just looking for advice and insight on a random idea I had.

does anyone here day trade? if so what sites do you use? i used coinbase to make my initial investment but its hard to use to make quick trades and I've seen people talking down on it here . does anyone have suggestions for another site to use to buy bitcoin on quickly or just at all in the future? thanks

As a 19-year-old who has never had a credit card or any really significant financial responsibility, I was wondering in theory how well it would work to apply for a credit card, invest in bitcoin with my credit card, and liquify my bitcoin and pay the credit card payment at the end of the month or whatever the payment period is and profit off of my gains. After having a short experience with bitcoin and seeing gains of up to at least 20% weekly currently, I was wondering if I could take it a step further and make some actual money to invest in something more stable and consistent in the long run on the stock exchange. I apologize if this sounds extremely uninformed, but I just wanted some input from adults who know what the fuck they're doing with their money and whether or not this is feasible. thanks

thank you fam, if you wouldn’t mind explaining what is a limit order and why doesn’t it have fees and what is a market order and why does it have fees?  im not exactly trying to day trade because I know it’s basically educated guessing/gambling but I just want the most efficient/community approved way to buy bitcoin.
