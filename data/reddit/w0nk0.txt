Huh, in old-fashioned Europe, we call our  manufacturers 'parents' (:..

Being German, I was pretty shocked to learn how veal was produced in the US. To my knowledge, it was never anything like that in central Europe, hence no such reservations towards it, it's just considered a more tender meat.

I'd say among Germans, the racist and nationalist communities overlap about 90 percent. Remember, Germany is a country that has about a dozen other countries within half a days drive. It's hugely different from the US regarding those things.

Knowing a couple folks in the US that have actually studied German (and speaking it natively myself) I'd say it's not easy. I actually think in English relatively often because, even being a native German speaker, German often is complicated, English is just such an efficient tool to get the job done. German is a tool that has been honed and perfected over centuries to get the job done in the most precise, scientifically correct way. :)

In the future, the robber might know if his wallet has received the funds..

I don't think it's a problem - they can put the coins into their own packet directly on the site. They can still pass them on to someone else who might have a wallet as payment, and they are safe from the transaction being reversed.

Quick Q: How are the users protected from you/your site taking their coins?

Ah, running it locally in the browser is what I was hoping for as a response, that's very neat! Maybe you should add a one-liner explaining that! I like the concept even better knowing this.

How do you handle the security aspect of having everything in btc? Cold storage?

[Google Translate Link]( - couldn't do that earlier, was on mobile
Also, if the word "train" seems oddly sprinkled across the article, that's because the city's name "Zug" translates to "train" in English. Silly Google Translate ;).
