Hell, I'm still trying to get to 1 coin! Almost there though, HODL!

Not real sure where to ask this question, Is it safe to give out your api key and why or why Not? Also what is a secret key? I'm not opposed to researching if some has a good source, all I'm finding are over my head.

Anyone feel like explaining how to read this? Or maybe point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance.

Thanks for the quick response, I recently found an app thats in beta, I want to help the developer work through bugs. It is an app that will take your info from exchanges and wallets and keep track of your trades and profit/loss in your phone. The data is not stored anywhere but your phone. Now since it needs access to your exchange and wallet info to do this, it is asking for the api key and that it be set to read only. Would it be safe to do this or could this compromise my wallets and exchange info?

I was just about to ask that. I put in my keys for an exchange I only have doge in just to test and the app looks really neat, thanks again!

Is the secret key the same as your private key?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:18:07
With that last thought in mind, I can give out my api key with read only permission to an app like Mint (the one I'm looking at is in beta called Bitsnapp). As long as it's read only and I don't give out the secret key all should be safe?

Gotcha, thanks!

Great, thank you for the help!

No idea what this was until your post. AWESOME!

I started buying a small amount to dip my toes. After that I researched and started buying more, once I felt comfortable with what I was doing and what it is all about I started buying in much larger sums. Granted that was only a little over a month ago but for me that small investment gave me a strong reason to research.

I started out using coinbase, the fees are ridiculously high but they are easy to understand. I have since switched to using other exchanges and a hardware wallet. Now that they have a court order to share their clients info with the gov I really don't have much interest in using their services. Thank you for making those lists for exchanges and wallets. You can research for days on end and still question if you found the right spot, those lists make it much easier, thanks again. Let's get those lists to the front page for all to see!

This is a very generous thought. I like the idea and will do some research to find organizations that accept bitcoin that would benefit from your (and hopefully others reading this) generosity.

I agree with you though, people should research and get informed before throwing money at it. A couple people lose money by getting scared and the bad rumors start flying around.

Could just be me but im not able to add my email to the waiting list. From my galaxy note 8 i tap the spot to enter email and it immediately closes my keyboard. Not sure which end the issue is, if it's on mine advice would be appreciated. App looks good and I definitely look forward to using it!

Great question, glad Reddit peeps came through, my stomach dropped just reading that as it could happen easily. I actually just lost out on some money from trading to a wrong address, I double checked it but that didn't do any good as I was double checking the wrong address to begin with.

I use blockflolio as well, is it just a tracker or can you actually purchase through it?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:52:40
I use coinbase as well, starting to use gdax now. I store most of mine in a ledger nano. They are cheap and fairly easy to use.

I feel lucky but you should really charge your phone.

I'd like to add to this sentiment. I am very new to bitcoin. It started as a hope to get quick money to pay for my upcoming wedding and honeymoon. It didn't take long for me to start reading and researching about my plan. Maybe 2 months in and Im already off my plan to get rich quick and a believer in what is being accomplished. I've learned a lot over the last 2 months and still have much to learn. I am constantly checking any resources I find to better understand and hopefully contribute to this new world that has been opened to me. I enjoy reading the stories of success surrounding bitcoin. Thank you to the core developers and all the miners that strengthen what is being accomplished.
