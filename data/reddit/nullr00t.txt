Have you enabled rpc in bitcoin.conf ?

What are the requirements regarding bitcoind config to be able to run lnd ? 
I currently already run a bitcoind node but pruning is enabled and I did not enable txindex ... 
Could you share minimal conf/ lines to get a working lnd ?

^ this, underrated.
With NAT used everywhere...

I also pull the code and run a full node even if I don't do any mining.
I don't trust, I verify.

After how many tx/output is it still considered tainted ?
The highest number is your answer then the highest likelihood it's yes.

Even in Japan they don't use kanji for Bitcoin author as they refer him as サトシ (read as Satoshi) which use Katakana system (alphabet used for word or name from foreign origin)
So affect a random kanji to Satoshi would not be appropriate as kanji have meaning (idea) by themselves and we don't know which kanji (meaning) is affected to the Bitcoin author.

If you understand the real power of Bitcoin (permissionless, decentralized, safe) as long as you own the key and store them safely, *no matter how much $/€/¥ it is*, you'll get some (even small fraction) for sure.

Are you serious?
Maybe you should considerate to use privacy filter on screen then.
You can't complain about someone's ability to read (or record) your screen if you did not do anything to prevent it...

Can use any wallet for paying? 
Last time I wanted to try they asked me to use BitFlyer app. (In Japanese) so I paid in ¥.

Maybe first time for them (I mean those employee). Thanks next time I know where to spend.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:41:08
^ this.

Depends on your usage. Do you often need to move your satoshis ? Do you just stack ? 
There is not a best wallet, it really depends on how you use your satoshis.
My experience :
- I use 2 electrum seeds (**multisig 2 of 2**) for stacking up, I never spend from this wallet.
- A small part of my stack goes here : I sometime use bitrefill and spend some satoshis in physical shops, I use eclair wallet on my phone, with a limited amount only.

As u/user_name_checks_out says, it may bring some kind of privacy.
But don't forget that running your own full node allows you to :
* \*\*Verify yourself the blockchain data\*\*, or the famous \*\*Don't trust, verify\*\*
   * so you don't have to trust another full node (\*\*SPV wallets and any custodial wallet\*\*, except if you run your own SPV/fullnode gateway, like running an Electrum personal server) that could have forged blocks with fake transactions.
If I ran a bitcoin full node \*\*with an altered code\*\* and make me able to forge blocks with transactions I want inside, you would have no idea that my node lies to you if you just run a SPV wallet that trusts only one node.


The reason behind that argument is - I suppose - HW wallet are the most safe/user-experience balanced way to store seeds.
In my opinion Multisig 2-of-2 with one seed on a offline computer fits to my security requirements.
I personally use Electrum Multisig 2/2, but everyone has its own needs and expects different things regarding UX/user experience.

Did you know btcpay server is open source ?
Which means that you can modify the code to fit your own goal, or ... simply see the available plugins, or hire someone to write one that fits your own need.
Bitpay is not. [open source]

What if the VPN is spying?
Using a VPN provider means that you let it access all your IP traffic.
Using a VPN means that you trust more this service provider than your *actual* internet service provider, although it is a real good idea in public WiFi networks, it is likely to be a bad idea when you're on a private network. Except if you cannot trust your ISP, for example if the ISP belongs to the government.

Really love it, and appreciate you let the code accessible.

Depend on price and ability to ship far far away (Japan in my case now), I admit that I prefer the one with Nintendo logo but this one is also amazing I have to say.
If I can pay by LN it's a big plus.
