Denarius was more fun a "fun" investment and I received a few bounties when it was pretty cheap.
Sia coin because I worked in a data center with backup software and think it could actually be a great platform for non critical data storage, especially IF they get it to where it can be streamed/implemented into a web interface/media streaming application. Netflix, dropbox etc could use the storage as an enterprise platform to store large amounts of data very cheaply. As of now though it is not ready for any data that needs to be stored safely.. but it works unlike filecoin. Storj needs the Storj team/company to keep it going and Sia is decentralized.
Vertcoin, I like what it is, it's been higher and seems low from what it could be a year down the road.

It's because it is brand new and unstable.

I told my self it was too late at $60, then $100 and then at $1000 I said I could never catch up.
Forgot about it for years, here we are now. Wish I'd put some money in and forgot about it back then.. Now I have automated buys $200 every so often and I try not to look, but lately it's been to exciting.

Then why not go there and dump?
Each exchange is different and is going to have their own precautions.

I wouldn't make that stretch, it's trading 2% the volume there. Will we see a drop? Probably. Will it be 50% or more? I doubt it.
It seems pretty stable at .2+

It's because block times are so far apart because the difficulty needs to readjust. Stop being so damn dramatic.

He's saying you are posting a tweet regarding completely different information than the original tweet that you talking about.
Can't fix stupid though. Continue on sir.
