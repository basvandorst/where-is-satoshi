Look what happened to Seattle.   Laid off more workers and now looking into replacing with AI and kiosks.   Lot of small businesses run off razor like margins.   Mid America’s cost of living is much less than the coasts.   Going put more small businesses out of business and push people toward the coasts.   Good way for politicians to gain more power.  Higher prices in restaurants...  less visits to restaurants.  Do that, Ill cook more at home.

16 gb micro sd cards are dirt cheap.  Partitioned into 2 sections.  Install free encryption with seed on one, copy of the free encryption software on the other.   Multiple copies can be hidden anywhere.   Behind photos, under the bed, behind the tv, taped on a ceiling fan, inside the battery compartment of a used dildo, .... use your imagination.  ��

Sovereign of an Individual is a good read.   Predicted the rise of crypto currencies.   The Governments are at a decline and changing over to the Information Age.   Any time we change in or society, it will eventually lead to increased violence.  Next recession is going to be brutal.

US Government confiscated gold from private citizens in the 1930s.   Venezuelan Military stealing anything of value from citizens fleeing to the border including laptops to extract gold.   Britain prosecuted gold investors in the 60s.  Can’t own more than 4 gold coins.  Italy forced citizens to trade their gold wedding rings for steel ones in the 30s.  Many more examples throughout history.    Pretty tough to move them around without arousing suspicions

Don’t forget to stock up on non-perishable food, water, gold, guns and ammo.   If shit hits the fan, and there is hyper inflation... might be good to be prepared.  Can’t eat bitcoin.

Electoral college is there to prevent candidates from campaigning just California, New York, Florida and Texas.  Votes won’t matter for the rest of the states. 
And Hillary is using Big Tech like Google to manipulate the elections.  As much as 2.5 Million to 15 Million.  So the popular vote is moot.

And support open borders and free healthcare to all illegals.   Obama penalized American citizens for not having health insurance.  Then turn around and give it to illegals for free.   Your taxes will go up to 50%+ easily.

They been screaming about climate change for decades.  Al Gore said there will global warming and no more glaciers now..... 13 yrs ago.   We still have ice glaciers.  Scare tactics to steal more $$.   All ice melt?   Sure.   Probably 100-200 yrs from now.   Way before you are dead.

No, the gold is real 100%.   The only difference is the faked official stamp with serial numbers.   Those gold bars tend to command higher premiums because its like getting a certificate of authenticity.   You don’t have to question the origin, if it’s filled with tungsten, purity, size is correct, etc.   Because of the stamp, banks will take it as face value.   They do the same for collectibles like comics, sports cars, paintings, etc.  
And it comes down to illegal gold miners, drug dealers, and rogue governments can move large amount of real gold with that fake authentic stamp with serial numbers and sell it anywhere.  
This means nothing about limiting your ability to make your own bars.  It will just cause the buyers to take more extra steps to test and make sure that your gold is real and legit.    Yeah the author is a dumbass for not explaining it more.

Lol now that’s funny.   Yang want bigger government, higher taxes and more regulations.  None of those conservatives support.

Race to the bottom.  Everyone is cutting interest rates and some countries are in the negative territory.   US stock market is crazy high due to cheap money and stock buybacks.  Pension funds are way underfunded and been taking riskier investments to catch up.  Negative interest rates continue to hammer retirement funds.   Deutsche bank is a biggie thats not looking good and will be the next Bear Sterns but worse.  Yes, I’m bullish on Bitcoin

Scarcity.  More scarce than gold. 
Look at Venezuela.    Wanna carry around trash bag full of Bolivar currencies to buy a loaf of bread?  
What about a gold coin?  Kinda hard to get change back.
