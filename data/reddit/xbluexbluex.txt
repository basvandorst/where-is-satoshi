My father bought computers.com and didn't renew it because my grandfather thought it would generate unwanted visitors lol.. The Internet was so new they didn't even understand that anyways cnet bought it for millions a while back. There are always so many should of would have could haves in life. 
It's really a shame though sorry for your loss.

"maybe" lol really though.. who knows, I did some simple math a couple months back and came up with the number $265 as the lowest it will hit before it makes a huge recovery. basically i compared the last couple spikes and crashes and found that it falls to an average of about 2.XX of what it originally was before all inflation durning the lowest point. with that being said this is all theory, I could be very wrong.

I just lost a third of the money I made from working over Christmas break... woopy!
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:09:53
I bought at $280 right before the crash, glad I just have my money back.
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:27:26
It doesn't even look like they're on the same page yet imo.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:15:58
Wasn't the contract broken after the fact though? sorry I don't understand the law very well.

@_date: 2017-08-29 15:19:37
why is this, just wondering?

I have him home addresss.. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:53:21
idk you're right about the mtgox thing
still the fact he avoided me to give me even the mtgox kraken money..
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:07:56
So basically this guy was selling contracts saying that he was going to mine Bitcoins as long as I gave him a certain amount of Bitcoins and paid him some money up front and we did it all through eBay and we wrote out up a contract. I ended up paying maybe $1,000 and then the empty God's thing happened he said he lost all my money. So I kept but so I kept bugging him over the years and then finally I pull out the contract and it reads that I should get I should get a lot of Bitcoins and obviously the value has increased so much. So yeah I need a good breach of contract lawyer thanks. I'm honestly willing to split the money 30-70 if it's a really good lawyer I really want to win this case and get my money back. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:06:27
I will be
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:18:11
hmm maybe I'll start there
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:19:01
that's why I made this thread, I called one and they said they cost 80k lol..
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:13:07
Wish I found this a month earlier :/
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:11:50
It was in early August 2013 that the contract was signed and the statue of limitations is 4 years here in California. Couldn't a good lawyer argue that the contract wasn't broken until later though?
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:08:01
will do appreciate it
@_date: 2017-04-28 16:25:46
I'm getting nervous as fuck
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:35:44
My fear actually can apply to trading anything. Anytime a market gains value at not normal rate (like bitcoin has been doing lately) it means it's unstable growth and it will have to crash at some point. With that said it may go up $1000 more before a major crash, who knows but it will have a pretty big drop before it gets stable again. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:40:34
Yeah right now maybe a great time to buy! who really knows I'm just getting nervous. I'm a nervous sorta guy though lol.
@_date: 2017-04-28 16:47:04
can you give me any helpful tips on how not to get scammed on those?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:27:47
I feel like I just blinked and it dropped down $180
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:13:19
There is no good website sadly, they all suck so much. Is it really that hard to make a decent site? I feel like these companies have to be making good money.

I don't think Bitcoin was even a thing when they made it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:30:10
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:08:09
Yeah I did the same thing when I found out about bitcoin. Wish I held it instead of making a quick profit (I wanted to hodl but all my friends said it was never going above like $40 lol, those same friends are still telling me to sell today smh)and I started investing in 2010 and my dad told me to do Index funds and I've made a little but I've made far more money with Bitcoin. Nothing life changing but more money than I ever did with Index funds.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:44:54
I have no idea what your credit card terms are but most banks have really high fees on any charges considered a "Cash Advance" 
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:55:31
Haha I mean that makes sense but I think he meant the media / world thinks he ODed cause he's always talkin bout lean. If you're anything like me you probably thought that cause you were too busy yelling the lyrics when Future comes in on Big Rings.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:18:39
Sad I even put 10% of my money in Index funds lol..
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:59:45
last time prices got like $200 a part from exchanges was mtgox
this isn't good and doesn't representative the real price
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:26:30
Story gets worse every time I read it lol.

I think the lil coin in the car went into a free fall backwards for a bit. Seems like he's making his way back though.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:01:56
I feel like back in the day a 20% drop seemed massive compared to other Investments but now people just see a 20% drop and say oh yeah that's just Bitcoin being Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:15:04
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:56:47
I did the same! sadly I sold 1.82 off. Still up a lot though.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:35:44
"It's likely that credit card providers would treat a bitcoin purchase as a cash advance."
From CoinBase
Sure those fees would destroy what you'd get from the 1% plus they probably give you it back on all purchases expect cash advances :-) 
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:36:24
Idk man hahaha, well I'm going to stop derailing this guys thread it was kinda his fault cause the title though lol.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:47:48
I remember spending into the double digits of bitcoins on orders back then.. Oh how I wish I kept them lol.

@_date: 2013-11-24 19:34:12
Totally agree but the price after the crash will still be sitting in the 300s.. obviously that's just my opinion but these bubbles always seem to get more long term investors on board. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:31:59
He made some amazing points but he also said some things that just weren't true or showed a lack of understanding.
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:00:38
I had something like this happen but the issue got cleared up after a few hours with no need to contact customer support.. I think they just noticed the issue because it left me with negative bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:33:15
wow this is a shame..
remember guys money will come and go it's a part of life
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:55:37
I disagree this kind of insane growth will always bring new long term investors.. a month or two after these rallies the price seem to always be sitting at about 300%+ of what they were before.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:20:58
Does he not even realize the 30 under generation doesn't carry around cash because there is a risk of losing it and everyone accepts debt/credit.. why would I put 2.5k in my wallet? Haha
