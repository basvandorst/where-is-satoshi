Being able to perform thousands of transactions per second does not suck.

They stand more to gain by letting it go and monitoring the exchanges to enumerate their outflows and who is responsible.  You can bet they will try to suppress the price at the same time to keep it from displacing their money flow.

Miners can run LN nodes so that argument is total BS.

You are being taken for a ride.  The dump had nothing to do with China.  Whales are moving money around for a big ripple(xrp) pump and dump.  They just pushed that news for cover.

You need bitcoin to run a node and miners mine bitcoin.  It is an opportunity for miners to invest a portion of what they mine with very little risk.

I call it realistic.  I believe the PBoC will do everything they can to suppress the price to keep it from competing with their own mints\profits.

The source is Bitstamp.  A whale is about to pump ripple so they can finally dump the shitcoin they have been holding.

The devs have already said multiple times that LN does not need segwit.  It would be a nice to have not a need to have.

Maybe they mean nothing in relation to the protocol and how bitcoin works has changed.  You can manipulate price but not the protocol.
