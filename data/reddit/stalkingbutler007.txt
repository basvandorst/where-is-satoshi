Happy Birthday! Do you think Bitcoin and machines will eventually make a jobless society possible?

This is great! I'll definitely have to consider entering this! I've thought about doing a series of bitcoin related political figures that started off with a drawing of Andreas Antonopoulos.  I mostly work in black and gray, but I've been feeling like doing some color painting in the near future :) Oh, and I did this silly one of Putin with kids chalk earlier this summer

Thank you good sir! I'll be looking forward to it :)
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:12:35
Yay, tips!
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:56:36
Congrats!  I've never bought bitcoin with cash but it's nice that that's an option. The more options for people to buy bitcoin the better :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:07:18
I accept Bitcoin, so should you :)
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:41:39
Thank you :)

Still going?

Thank you so much :) 👍

I'm new to reddit, should this be nsfw or is it ok? What's the general opinion with you bitcoiners out there?
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:20:50
Hey, hey, you got it! 100 bits Congratulations! :)

That's exactly the conclusion I came to as well. I would have appreciated a notice prior to the change.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:37:20
Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:23:20
I'm considering it but I haven't set a price yet. It definitely won't sell for anything other than BTC though. I'm open to offers.

The original photo shows Andreas licking a hammer as a parody that he took to raise money for RAINN. This is just what I saw every time I looked at the photo, so I drew it.

I just posted a new drawing with a chance to win 100 bits if you can identify the model.  It's marked nsfw.
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:34:09
Thank you for explaining a little of the history behind this piece Mr. Antonopoulos. I hope everyone realizes that it's a parody of a parody and was done with tongue in cheek. It would be great if those tipping me could send an equal amount to RAINN to honor the original's intent. Thank you all again :)

Thank you :)

Oops, it looks like I replied to he wrong person, haha! Sorry about that, 100 bits @_date: 2015-03-04 23:36:22

I'm going to have to hold out for higher. Thank you though :)

For sure, thank you :)

Yes, this is an excellent approach, it's the real secret to investing. It's called dollar cost averaging.

Thank you sir, that's exactly what I did! I've been meaning to setup my GDAX account for months but the website won't load from my phone and I have been to lazy to try from my PC. Now that I got it set up I actually saved money with my buying strategies on GDAX compared to buying directly from Coinbase. Thank you for the suggestion and fee information.

Hmm, I never received a message from changetip saying that I had received the tip. Is it because of the last "/" on your post? Just letting you know, I don't want to sound like I'm complaining about your charity :) Thanks again :)
