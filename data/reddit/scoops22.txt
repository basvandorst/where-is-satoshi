The other currency which I won't name to avoid being banned is simply offering a service at a more competitive price. The free market will decide which one it wants to use.

Credit cards charge vendors ~3% fees which REALLY adds up. There are already feeless cryptos out there capable of handling thousands of tx/s. These can do the job better than credit cards or paypal or any service in existence right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:08:34
Sure that benefits you the consumer but that doesn't help retailers at all. Also credit card benefits amount to 1% at most for cash back and like 2-3% for stuff like Airmiles AND you have to pay for these sorts of cards. So if your card costs $20 a year the first $2000 you spend is just breaking even on the fees.

Hey there. Did an internship where I did expat tax returns. The American returns were the worst because you always had to file some treaty B.S. to avoid double taxation. 
American Citizens and green-card holders are taxed on their worldwide income regardless of where they are. They are always considered residents. For comparison in Canada whether you are a resident or not is based on how many days you worked in the country that year.

Poor example, what I meant to do was to create an imaginary company that is doing something clearly evil, yet profitable and lets say for the sake of argument *legal*. The point I was trying to make is that the reason you would sell is not because of legal proceedings down the line but because you are a human being, not a robot, and that is so easy to forget in Finance and Economics. And sorry but you being invested fully implicates you on a moral level. You are an owner of that company, your dividends are reaped from their activities. 
Personally, when a company's actions go way against my beliefs I don't buy their products. Will it make a difference? No. But I vote with my dollar. That is the difference between you and I and we will never come to an agreement on that. What we should be able to agree upon is that such an action is not *irrational*. It is pre-meditated, it is calculated. It is not knee-jerk like selling on fear and buying on greed. 
Now would I personally sell Apple over a few Bitcoin apps? No. It isn't important enough to me. But if OP is fundamentally against central banks and vehemently supports Bitcoin then you can imagine Apple is really crossing the line for him.
So yes, you're right. On a technical level OP's decision maybe isn't the best investment decision unless his reason for it is because he thinks it's a signal that Apple will no longer be at the cutting edge of innovation (A point I made which you didn't address). 
BUT don't discredit his actions as stupid and emotional or because it won't make a difference. That's the sort of mentality which makes voter turn out so poor during elections and makes boycotts never work.

Usually when we talk about investing on emotions we mean fear and greed. Choosing not to invest on a matter of principle is not a question of emotion but a question of integrity.
Now *you* follow along carefully here with me. Despite most of what you said being true what I'm telling you is that when it is a matter of principle there is nothing wrong with what OP did and I'm certain that he doesn't mind standing alone. 
Let me make an extremely exaggerated example to make it obvious for you. Lets say you're invested in a huge very profitable company who you found out murders children. Would you continue to hold your shares in this very profitable company because "selling would be an emotional decision?" I don't know what you would do but I personally wouldn't want to be a partial owner of that company, profits be damned. I refuse to sell my own integrity and there is *nothing* wrong with that because we are human beings. I am not selling on fear or greed I am selling because I have morals. There is a BIG difference. One is a calculated decision and the other is a quick adrenaline fueled irrational decision. The latter is what we call "investing on emotions" in finance. *fear* and *greed*. 
In conclusion, if for OP, Apple's stance on Bitcoin is extremely important and if for him that doesn't line up with his beliefs then by all means sell. There are thousands of other comparable investments out there. At the end of the day us rational investors are still human beings not robots.
Now changing pace and looking at this from a financial theory perspective. If OP is a rational investor then his portfolio is well diversified, whether he achieved this through ETFs or by having a collection of securities. At this point if CAPM holds true (and despite CAPM's assumptions many investment managers use it in the real world to value risk) then AAPL to him is nothing more than a number for beta. He can simply replace it with another company with a similar beta and nothing of value was lost. 
Finally if OP truly believes Bitcoin is the future then to him Apple's negative stance on it could be signalling that they will no longer be the leading innovators that they once were. Don't forget Apple is only worth as much as it is because its investors expect high growth and constant innovation. 
And if I were to give my own personal opinion, if the iPhone 6 is nothing short of spectacular I think OP would be right in that thinking.

Honestly I believe in Bitcoin but the opinions of the people in this subreddit make me want to divest because it simply isn't a healthy mentality for any market. An irrational market is terrifying. 
The other day I had a guy arguing with me that losing the ETF is good because volatility is *good* for Bitcoin (madness as volatility is the enemy of any currency). I ask him why he thinks it's good and he says quote: "When there is volatility there is a HUGE opportunity to make money on EVERY TRADE."
I'm sorry but if that isn't delusional and uninformed I don't know what is. And for clarity I did a bachelors in Finance and work in the industry.... You could use the same argument to say penny stocks are a great investment... just madness.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:24:30
Using Bitcoin exclusive as a form of protest to the establishment or as a matter of principle is something I can absolutely respect. My concern is those putting all of their saving in BTC simply to make money and who don't acknowledge what's at stake.
Of course everybody is free to do as they wish with their money but this behavior shouldn't be encouraged. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:05:31
I've seen top comments arguing that holding fiat is *as* risky as holding Bitcoin.... Despite decades of data, statistics, and well known very measurable risks. People saying there are currencies out there that are worse as if anybody is suggesting the alternative to Bitcoin is the Zimbabwe Dollar. People arguing that Bitcoin will succeed literally because they believe the current world order will imminently collapse.
I see people *in this thread* arguing that it's a good idea to put your life savings in Bitcoin because "even if they lose it all I have my paycheck on Friday".
Maybe I take this to heart because I spent 4 years studying Finance but this sort of stuff is just madness!
We don't even have to talk about fiat vs. BTC just investing in general the benefits of diversification in investments are statistically **proven**. It is a fact of mathematics that having a diversified portfolio provides additional return per point of risk and yet I see people agreeing with those who put every dime in BTC (seriously these comments are in this very thread).
This, my friend, is pseudoscience.

So first of all great post. The main purpose of my OP was to tackle the issue of echo-chambering - people downvoting other comments simply because they disagree and not based on the quality of their content which in my opinion narrows this subreddit down to a single-track hivemind.
Volatility has indeed been decreasing and that's great! I used the volatility thing as an example of how comments that have no basis in reality get upvoted simply because it makes people feel better about a not great situation - I don't understand how I kept seeing posts arguing that volatility is a *good* thing. It simply isn't, not for BTC as a currency and not for BTC as a store o value. If you think it's good because the price jumping around lets you risk it all on day trades then you have Casinos for that. 
As for BTC as a store of value and as a hedge against the stock market/fiat currencies (an alternative to gold) I think it already plays that role very well. As a stand alone currency we have a long way to go.

The best investments are NOT volatile the best investments provide *alpha* that means they provide excess return per unit of risk vs. the market. You can have an exceedingly risky (volatile) investment with a very poor expected return. Guys please Finance is a field people actually study (myself included) lets not make stuff up.
If volatility was so great people would be investing in penny stocks.

You understand that inflation is generally speaking worse for rich people than for poor people right? Inflation is beneficial to debtors and negative for lenders. A debtor (i.e. a poor person who has to borrow money to buy their home and car and everything) will find that their debt is easier to pay over time as inflation devalues the debt.

Ya the 6 month timeframe thing is definitely shit customer service but I don't know if that would be illegal.
I suppose since every other exchange has managed to sort it out in a matter of days you could argue in court that fiduciary duty is still being broken as clearly they didn't do everything in their power to fulfill their duty in the best interest of their customers. 
I'm not a lawyer though and I don't have an article to quote so that's just me guessing.

In my first comment I had a real lawyer to quote so I was confident for that particular scenario. For your question all I can do is speculate.
From my understanding the key to this duty is to act to the best of your knowledge in the best interest of your shareholders/clients/account holders (whoever you have a fiduciary duty to)
Therefore as long as their account holders are entitled to your new coin and as long as it holds value then they must distribute it. In stock markets you have stock splits, dividends and voting rights that are all forwarded to the owner of the stock. I imagine this would be similar in the eyes of the law.
If to the best of their knowledge your hardfork will be dead on arrival and worthless then they wouldn't have to do anything.
Here is what I'm referring to for this speculation:


I would love to hear from a lawyer about this though as it's definitely a great question.

It happened yesterday. It is one of the most important events to Bitcoin in its whole history. It's absolutely still relevant.
Think of it this way. if you're a casual Bitcoin holder and you check this subreddit once a week or so, maybe less. Wouldn't you want to know that your coins split and you now hold another currency? Isn't that VERY relevant to you?
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:00:16
I know this is a joke and all but in case anybody thinks this is actually valid it isn't because a currency's loss of value is actually measured by what goods it can buy not by its value relative to other currencies. In other words inflation is 2% or less per year and measured by CPI (consumer price index). 
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:14:43

@_date: 2017-08-03 16:55:53
The chart shows USD crashing so no it isn't valid because it isn't crashing. Is Bitcoin soaring in value? Yes. But USD isn't crashing. 
What I'm saying is you have to compare Bitcoin to what goods it can buy (In that respect it has been going through the roof).
And you have to separately compare USD to what it can buy (about 2% less per year) which is far from a crash.
What I'm saying is that looking at that chart and saying fiat is crashing is not valid. I agree its great that Bitcoin is deflationary but that is besides the point.

If $1 USD can buy me a loaf of bread in 2009 and it can still buy me a loaf of bread in 2017 then its value hasn't crashed. This is what I'm trying to explain.
Now Bitcoin was able to buy not even 1 loaf of bread in 2009 and now it can buy 3000 loaves of bread so it has absolutely skyrocketed in value but my point still stands that USD has not crashed.

I'm not a lawyer but the person I quoted *is* a lawyer and she says they have a fiduciary duty to their account holders and that they are liable for negligence and unjust enrichment if they kept the funds.

@_date: 2017-08-04 01:29:27

Crypto is great for having control of your own assets. Nothing is stopping an app developer to create a "tap" payment system for crypto. In fact I'm sure one exists. Also we have crypto credit cards that use our crypto like a bank but settle in fiat - can be used on any credit card terminal.

I already pay for Starbucks using the app they have where you pay with a QR code. I'll bet they could start accepting bitcoin with a simple firmware update of their existing hardware.

And she's also rational and intelligent unlike the idiots at Fox. She asks reasonable questions which aren't loaded and don't have her own opinion injected into them and allows the interviewee ample time to speak and respond to the questions.

Don't compare Bitcoin to Hedgefunds.
The people who bought Bitcoin at 13$ were gambling and they won.
Hedge funds take very calculated risks, take on short positions to hedge against loses. Actively manage their portfolios. 45% is extremely impressive.
It's all about risk to reward and sorry to say but Bitcoin is *extremely* risky.
For the record I'm invested in BTC so I wish it all the best but as a Finance student that knows a bit about how complicated/difficult it is and how much work it takes to run a hedge fund I think it's stupid to put the word astonishing in quotations before a 45% return.

Sorry but I *will* diss Virtex.
They want to charge me the equivalent of $50 for a sell order of 6 Bitcoin? Sorry but their fees are insane. 
I signed up at VoS and I hope it takes off.

This exactly. the idea is to have Bitcoin accessible to the masses. Anything that helps in that regard is a good idea in my book.

He made clear and concise arguments why he believes Bitcoin is a better form of money than Gold.

From my understanding they didn't register as an exchange with their bank and they have daily wire transfer limits as a result.

Thank you for taking the initiative. I wish you and your company all the best. Maybe I'll apply for a job in a year and a half when I graduate ;)

Thank you. Gonna look into this. Going to see if I can find some reviews confirming they are trustworthy before I give them all my information.

That's exactly my issue, Mt.Gox wouldn't be a problem if it wouldn't take a month from start to finish getting some coins in my hands. I've contacted 4 sellers locally so far, crossing my fingers and gonna keep trying. 
As a side note I think it is a detriment to the future of bitcoin that it is THIS difficult to get into. I know big changes are being made with the ATMs and all that but until then there are definitely improvements to be made. You shouldn't need to open a brokerage account and wire transfer funds across borders simply to convert a currency.
Here's hoping the currency conversion shops you find in the mall start working with BTC!

Actually if you're a big bitcoin holder you can make money by inducing panic. It's very simple: How do you make the most money possible? Sell riiiight as a bubble or panic sell begins. Now if you hold 15,000 BTC selling them in one go automatically triggers a panic sell so by default you are selling right at the start of a panic sell. You let the price crash with the waterfall you created and slowly buy back at the new lower price. 
The market isn't big enough yet to be immune to manipulation. 1000BTC bought or sold can move the price 30-40 points in one go depending on the time of day.

Bitstamp's validation process is fucking retarded for lack of better words.
I'm a student living at home. Utility bills ARE NOT ADDRESSED TO ME but that is too difficult a concept for them to understand. 
I provided a tax return, I provided my drivers license (that has my address on it) I provided a tuition bill and a utility bill that has my mother's name on it (same last name as me).
They refused all of that. 
Absolutely absurd. I still can't get verified with them. Gox and Cavirtex accepted me just fine.
Also their customer service are idiotic and cannot comprehend the simplest of things. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:58:56
It's so basic though you don't even need to be an economist! How can he say that investing $50 4 years ago made millionaires and that is less risky today because investing $50 today has no chance of making you a millionaire. 
That's like saying the angel investor who invested in Google day one took less risk than the guy investing in Google today because the angel investor made 1000s of % on his investment and you won't likely do that today. 
I can't fathom how anybody could not understand that concept.
Especially when he brought up risk Vs. reward I got excited for second. I'm thinking YES! That's right Peter, more risk means bigger price movements means higher reward potential! ... but he just gets it wrong again and again.

1. Not very satisfied with this answer. If all miners are only accepting high fees due to high congestion, high difficulty and low block rewards then it isn't *really* optional. It becomes sort of mandatory to pay their fees if you don't want your coins to sit in limbo. As somebody mentioned below I guess this could be resolved with "Bitcoin Banks" where transfers are free among members. The way Bitcoin is designed is it possible to make big updates to the protocol such as allowing people to contribute some processing power and bandwidth instead of a fee (even if like you said that is not possible now)? I'm worried that banks offer a better system down the line and Bitcoin won't be able to compete.
2. This remains a concern. Any ELI5 to tell me why I can trust that this issue is resolvable (Can we know these top when will be able to handle it)?
3. This raises a new question. To what degree is the protocol update-able? Is it only possible to update the clients it works with? I'm really not understanding this part gonna need an ELI5 here too.
Thanks for the quick responses!
Getting downvoted probably because I said I wasn't satisfied with the first answer. I didn't mean I wasn't satisfied with the way mccorvic answered the question (that would be rude) I meant that it didn't satisfy my concerns.

Their fee is 1.5%. 3 times that of any other exchange.

This is beyond frustrating. I'm right now contacting a Redditor who offered to help locally. Hopefully that will work out. 
Bit stamp will be no joke the 5th or 6th website I register for in an attempt to purchase bitcoins. Lets see how this one goes.

Thanks for the reply. Your response along with the other 2 responses mostly calms my concerns about 1) and 2). Still not 100% on 3) but I asked a follow up question above. If the core devs decide what goes through and the masses disagree with what they're doing what can we do? For example a lot of people have eyes on how Facebook is updated but if we don't like the update there really isn't anything we can do. How is an open source project different in this regard?

It's sad that it has come to this. That what we assume the government will do is not what's better for the people but rather what is better for the government itself. This has become the norm.

Thanks to you and other commenters for confirming their trustworthiness. I'll open an account with them in that case.

I don't mean any offense at all but why don't you just place a limit order on your brokerage and it will be automatically executed when BTC hits your price point. 
What are the advantages of your system? Just wondering if I'm missing out.

I agree 100% if you aren't American it's a pain in the ass to get Bitcoins. Took me 2 weeks to get some when I first wanted to get in as the price doubled. Don't listen to this guy.

Thanks for showing me this. Looks great for future top ups but for now I'm trying to buy at least 5 BTC. looks like they don't allow that and charge pretty big premiums.

Why buy a car new when most cars lose 50% of their value in the first 3 years? Would rather have a 2-3 year old car, still under warranty for another 1-2 years almost half the price and depreciating at a declining rate. 
(I'm referring to luxury cars which depreciate by such drastic amounts in the first 3 years, look at BMWs for proof of this. Almost half price in 3 years.)

Does Peter really not understand volatility?
He's comparing investing $50 4 years ago vs. investing $1 Million today?
If $50 4 years ago is worth $1 Million today and $50 today is unlikely to become $1 million in the future then that EXPLICITLY means there was more volatility back then and in Finance Volatility is synonymous with risk. If the price 4 years ago was *capable* of moving such a magnitude that it could make millionaires from $50 then Bitcoin was more volatile/risky back then, simple as that.
Does Peter Schiff not understand the concept of percent change? What an idiot.

Thanks for the advice on the wallet. Most of my coins are on Gox and I plan on moving them out to cold storage. Also looking forward to [this](
My concern isn't for myself but for all users. I have plenty of bandwidth and HDD space my worry as an investor is that Bitcoin is accessible to Farmer Joe on satellite internet in Khazakstan. I want to know everybody will be able to use Bitcoin for years to come. Knowing that lightweight clients exist calms this concern, thank you.
For the way updates work still not understanding. I asked another question in reply to mccorvic above.


In other words if the protocol is very update-able I have nothing to worry about. If not and there is a major flaw discovered the only solution will be a mass exodus to another currency that doesn't have that flaw. This worries me.
