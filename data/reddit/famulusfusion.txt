Thermal paper fades quickly. Not good for private keys. I like the idea otherwise!

At some point, the mempool will fill up, and stay full. Some percentage of paid transactions will never confirm. To a non-technical user, bitcoin will appear broken.

Bitcoin is trying out a new technology called "probabilistic confirmation". Here is how it works: your transaction may, or may not, confirm. If it doesn't confirm, you didn't want it bad enough.

Agreed. I have booked several hotels using bitcoin on Expedia. Pleasant experience compared to credit cards. Sadly you cannot book flights with bitcoin on Expedia.
