Exactly, but bitcoin's level of entertainment is $0
If you equipped it with the latest Mission Impossible movie, it would be $10

Those conveniences are just a bonus IF a usage case is established first.
But if something is directly useless (e.g. a fake torrent) then it doesn't matter that it doesn't rust etc.

There aren't 150 trillion dollars in the world. You bonehead

If bitcoin was a currency, you would see things priced in it.
As in, if bitcoin fell to $1, then today's 10 BTC car would still sell for 10 BTC.
In reality, bitcoin prices are pegged to the dollar, which proves cryptos are not a currency.

Bitcoin is not even used in jewelry.

Usually, Not Having money is easier than Having Money. So you need more energy to inflate a bubble than to deflate it.
Therefore, there will not be ATH for the next 1 million years.
Just kidding, there will never be ATH.

Wasn't Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt the exact recipe for your recovery?

You are not transferring billions though, you are transferring bitcoins.
And as I've discussed in the post above, a bitcoin is a useless possession. 
So according to you I could have "safeguarded $19,750 on a single bitcoin in January, with an incredible degree of solidness."
And now, fart noise. That amount fell to $4,200 and falling like a rock.

My theory is that people enjoy paying as little as possible.
So like, even if you're a Bitcoin fan, if I offered it to you at $4000 now you would refuse.
 "I can get it lower!"
So, when you get in these spiral "asking wars," then the question is: "Why not even lower?" "Why not even lower?"
And that raises the question of bitcoin's fundamental value (intrinsic, redemption). That provides a floor.
Being that 21 million bitcoins and $5 gets you an espresso at starbucks, then the floor is somewhat low.

Imagine you profited 2 trillion dollars in Crime. Then you put your assets in bitcoin, and then you check this site to find out that your wealth dropped to 3 dollars.
That is why Bitcoin is not a store of value, but a Cambrian Extinction Event for the dumb.

Those things are an Added Bonus but don't function on their own without Direct Usefulness.
Direct usefulness = valuable
Direct usefulness + scarcity = more valuable
No direct usefulness + scarcity = not valuable

So, why are you saying "it will have application one day, wait for it." 
Why not just come out with the Killer App, it's been almost 1 year since Bitcoin has been released.
I fear that it's because there is no application.

Would it be fair to say that Bitcoin is a file?
Usually when you deal with computer things, then some collection of data is called a "file."
If bitcoin a file, can you give me an approximation of its size? Is it 10 megabytes or more like 10 terrabytes.
And final question, give me an example -- a sample from this data that is contained. Does bitcoin contain gibberish data like $DSGDF'%EDX, or does it contain understandable sentences like: "And then on January 3, Dave from Illionois decided to buy a pizza for 45 satoshis."

760 yes

That is like saying "A fake torrent is worth $1,000,000" because after all we live in a very Connected world.

That is where you are extremely and tragically wrong. 
Gold's value, which is the basis of its money function, is the 5% application in industry. 
Get it, gold couldn't be a store of value, if it didn't have the 5% intrinsic worth.
So now you are saying: "Check this out, BTC has 0% intrinstic worth, and that makes it much much better!"
Er, no. It makes it infinitely worse. In fact it makes it fucking zero.
@_date: 2018-11-24 12:37:04
Yeah but the only reason people cared is that it was Increasing Number of Dollars.
Today it's a get poor quick scheme

Because if you ever asked yourself why is Google worth a trillion dollars, the following is the answer.
A company earns money, so imagine you earned 12 billion a year. Amazing right, 1 billion dollars every month.
So whoever owns the company (owns the shares) gets to reap that income.
Therefore the owner will not just sell his company for $3750 for example, if he has a 30 million coming in every day

Gold at least is useful.
Bitcoin is literally something you can't do anything with, such as a bitcoin tooth.
