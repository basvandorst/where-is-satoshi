Because bitcoin has everyone spooked and any minor dips are going to cause a panic

How likely is this to bring about a "massive crash" as they call it? I'd love to hear speculations.

Hm haven't noticed that. My alts, XLM and VEN, had great days. Xlm stayed the same and Ven surged for 36 hours

 The technology has no value. The whitepaper outlined a peer-to-peer electronic cash service. That will never happen. None of you bought bitcoin to send money to others, you bought it to horde until its price rose.
Sure the price could come back with enough hype, but what earth shaking news is there to sell the grand lie again, "50K, 100K." Everytime you say anything that intimates price at all you illustrate Bitcoin's failure. Greed ruined it as surely as it does everything else. 
As long as people purchase bitcoin that cannot be used because they plan to hold it as an investment or because it's too volatile to justify everyday use it will never succeed as anything more than hype. Every comment on here gives advice on "trading"... The technology matters only as much as it creates hype. Your product isn't used as intended.
