This is my adult Christmas. I'm going to put my phone in the livingroom before I go to bed. When I wake up extra early tomorrow I'm going to rush to the living room and check the price. I hope to recive a euphoric body high from that ATH.

I have thought about selling my house near the beach in Baja Sur. Only accepting bitcoin :)

I like to go camping for a few days(no cell service). That first price check since being blacked out is the good shit, just like the burst time. That's how I get my fix.

"Everyone" will dump the S2X and big investors will scoop them up. Then they will pump'em.

This will happen one of these times.

I stay around Baja Sur. Thought about talking to resorts or yoga training places about accepting crypto.
Also thought about selling my house in Baja for crypto. Want to buy a house?

I'd like to see some aerial banners, you know the ones behind planes. Looks like they cost about $500 a flight. Scout out 4-5 locations across the USA that are having big outdoor events and fly a BUY BITCOIN banner around.

I wonder if bitcoin will help cause the market to crash?

It takes time. The price is falling. The coins  will be so cheap with a decent foundation to develop the coin. It won't be  but major profits will be had.

I could see that happening.

Not shitcoins. I could see a 3rd world country wanting to adapt a bitcoin spin off as their currency. I'm will to hodl all forked coins. One thing I know is NOONE knows what will happen in crypto.

What happens when it dosent drop? One of these times it going to jump up a lot. "Traders" will sell and never be able to buy back...cheap
