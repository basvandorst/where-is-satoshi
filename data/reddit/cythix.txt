I dunno why you are getting so much flak. It makes sense to me. When my money is in my checking account I perceive it as mine, even though I don't control it.. just have access to it.
If someone hacked the bank and wired my funds to another account and the bank said "a client's money was stolen" that would also make sense to me.
Obviously in the case of a bank though I'm protected by insurances, and would expect money returned to me in the amount lost.

What happens when the people who protect and insure your money are the ones who take it away? I suppose you are fortunate if you haven't been burned yet. I have had my finances frozen by the bank, therefore it is easy to know exactly how dependent on them I am. I got it cleared up the next day (because "that department" was closed already when I called in), but still the fact that someone other than me controls my money was pointed out that day.

@_date: 2014-09-23 19:21:44
I like the idea. You in theory can configure this anyway you want. You essentially just need a packet shaper that has an api if it isn't already built in. Let people pay by the byte, or pre pay for a set amount of bandwidth. Their payments would automatically configure the rule in packet shaper. Hopefully people who pay per byte use a retainer in case they are hacked, malware, dos, etc. 
You'd also need some decent level of monitoring as the client to ensure you aren't being skimped on your speeds. Doing speed tests would not be effective financially or accurate. A peer to peer bandwidth test like iperf may suffice.

I'm no expert, I just figure it's stupid to think that if you tie your bank account or credit card to a wallet to think you are anonymous as you send bitcoins around. If there is any way a transaction could be traced back to you, assume it will. I'm sure the IRS will be very interested in the US btc exchange records.

Overnight is too long anyway. I needed to get food for my family to eat on a roadtrip and could not. If I didn't have cash on hand I don't know what I would've done. Probably would've needed a family member to wire transfer me money and get wrecked with fees for it. That was a pretty big eye opener. To know your money (in the bank) is controlled by a 3rd party and that flip can be switched at any moment to turn your access.


The point was explicitly about credit card info, and you somehow twisted that to mean shipping information. Shipping information is not the same as credit card (billing) information. Maintaining your credit card (billing) information is not the same as shipping information. To go further if I buy a digital good a shipping address is not needed. But if I use a credit card I have to enter (or autofill) an address due to the credit cards billing address requirements. 


This one is my favorite. You use Paypal as an example of convenience for new merchants. And you are right to do so! Your checkout process is the same across any merchant who accepts it with Paypal. You just log in and authorize the payment. Very easy. With Bitcoin you don't even log in, you just authorize the transaction and its done. If I had to rank in order of ease of payment methods I would say bitcoin&gt;paypal/google&gt;bankrouting&gt;credit cards.


I don't know how you define easy but I know I can checkout faster with bitcoin than I can with a credit card on my home PC or mobile phone. Source: Have used credit cards and bitcoin in merchant checkouts in both scenarios at multiple vendors.
Overall, I think credit cards were a great concept and work best in the "swipe" environment they were designed for (ATMS/Point of Sale). It's a tech that was built pre-internet era. However, bitcoin is still just getting started and its already better for online purchases. In 5-10 years using a credit card online will be like using personal checks. Doesn't matter what replaces it bitcoin, paypal, or some unknown. There is room for improvement and credit cards are going to have to keep up or get left behind.
Fraud protection isn't exclusive to banks and credit cards. I bet we see bitcoin insurance pop up for people who are too inept, scared, or just lazy to be responsible with their money. Someone admitted to not caring about the cost of business in this same thread (may have even been you?) in regards to paying for fraud protection through credit card fees, premiums, and interest rates. Chargebacks .. I can't give a opinion here because I've never used it. You mean to have your credit card company reverse the charges? I've always just asked for a refund when needed, so far its always been granted. But I could see how its convenient for a consumer, and harder for a merchant to deal with them.

I bought a house after paying about 1k a month in rent as well. I bought 2 years ago, a new construction house so there were no "repairs" to cover as it was under warranty by the builder. I had no real assets, just a steady income. In fact I had to borrow money from family for the down payment. I just sold the house in May and after paying closing costs and agent fees still pocketed over 50k in the sale. Renting just means you are paying someones mortgage instead of your own.

I like your thinking. People are quick to forget it offers more than just a financial gain. Have a upvote @_date: 2014-09-26 06:08:38
I think it goes more like this:
Spend the time upfront to make sure using credit cards can be relatively convenient by entering in ALL your credit card information first time. Then updating the information you have when the card expires, you get a new card, card is lost, you change addresses, or has fraud detected on it. Then ignore all security precautions and enable anyone who knows your account login to purchase things at the click of a button including yourself!
Oh and repeat this process for EVERY OTHER MERCHANT you want to use your card with. Yeah, how could I have thought bitcoin was easier than that?
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:25:45

The difference is that one directly links your identity to your financial transactions, the other conceals it.

You have to put in effort in either case if you want the personal information.

Bitcoin changes and challenges how we think about money in general. I don't find it controversial, but talk to many people who do. Mainly people who only know about it through mass media, or are so institutionalized by the current system they can't think outside of it. I think if we simplified things the current closed off system is more controversial than an open one. Everyone wants to talk about how bitcoin is used for drugs or other illegal activities, but cash is king for these things.

You can't do anything with Ethereum. It hasn't launched yet. Bitcoin is a store of value because of its fixed supply. Ethereum has some amazing properties, but being valuable isn't necessarily one of them. I am very excited for it, and will use it I'm sure. I just think that the value of Ethereum will come from the applications on top of it more than the ether itself. You can invest in SMTP or GMAIL kind of scenario.

I would still say bitcoin is easier to pay with than a credit card (saved or not)
@_date: 2014-09-26 06:33:14
I said credit card information not shipping information. We didn't specify what we are buying, but lets say it needs a shipping address. Yep, gotta fill that out. Lets say it doesn't like digital goods. Bitcoin just became easier in that scenario. +1 for Bitcoin!
I know I have had at least 10 different cards due to them being lost, expiring, fraud, moving, etc. Glad we can use our personal experiences here. Oh I've also had my cards frozen by the bank for "suspected fraud". So now I don't have access to my own money and I have to wait for a new card to arrive if I want to pay via debit or credit card. 
Shipping information does not have to match billing information. That is unique to credit cards, doesn't apply to Bitcoin. Moving on...
So are you saying PayPal is more convenient than credit cards at the checkout now?
We could keep going around in circles but the fact of the matter is, if we both went to a new merchant for the first time and they accepted credit cards and bitcoin it would be easier to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 09:17:42

Donate is a good way to put it, because you don't have to give them any personal details if you pay with bitcoin. It will ask you, force you, to fill out the fields to continue, but if you want to put in your personal details that is up to you. It works fine if you fudge the whole  form.

@_date: 2017-01-07 21:04:43
Bitcoin is still relatively new and being tested, if mass adoption occurs that means people will all trust it. 
Why sell off trusted money to gain another form of money?
If I'm a whale and want to buy an aircraft carrier, and mass adoption has occurred, I pay in bitcoin - no sell off actually occurs just a transfer of wealth.

Just know you would have sold them early or lost them to gox :)

I know a lot of people who use notepad++, but I've always stuck with textpad. I should check if they accept Bitcoin. I seriously love using Bitcoin for donations. Wish my local radio stations would accept it, you give your info one time to them and they send you letters for life :/

You just said the only reason you invest in bitcoin is speculation based (major currency in 20 years) but you would sell all your Bitcoin if you thought it was speculative asset.

I've used it for anonymous donations quite a bit, sending money to friends, and buying my electronics off newegg.

I've been off grid in rural California for years, what do you mean there is no off grid solution? Like a turn key package?

Taiwan is the most amazing place I've ever been! The people are so thoughtful and kind. Even though I couldn't speak their language, it felt like communication was never an issue. Taipei was an amazing mix of old and new culture. I loved using the subway to go anywhere. I probably walked 6 miles a day or so just wandering. Took the high speed rail down to Kenting. Amazing beach town on the southern tip of the island. The bartender down at rabbit rabbit was a bad ass and just made a variety of drinks and appetizers for my buddy and I while chatting. The night markets are amazing! Dumplings that blew my mind and were always so cheap. We visited temples, night clubs, gaming centers, museums, historic landmarks,and even a lady ktv. I need to go again.

I know one person who lives in Taiwan but works remotely for an American company to take advantage of the cost of living. I dunno what jobs you could get there though. I was generally spending around $30 a night for housing, and maybe $10 a day in food. That was like tourist prices too. I've heard like $800 a month can get you a luxury apartment.

I went to taiwan with out knowing Taiwanese dollars. I took none with me because the exchange rate is better at their banks than here in the US. Exchanged my money in the airport there at a reputable looking bank. I trusted the money because I trusted where it came from, not because it looked authentic ( I had nothing to compare it to ).

I like the idea, but seems there is no real incentive to donate..?
@_date: 2015-03-07 00:22:13
Pro tip: keep legitimate bills on you to use for comparison, or ask a clerk to check one for you if you are unsure and happen to be at a retail store.

You need network access to process either. I don't know any credit card terminals as cheap as a $30 android phone though.

This is the open mirage team testing their TLS implementation for bugs. I think it's a cool idea but the bounty is pretty minimal considering the person who may find an exploit could very well be using their talents to bring in $100k+ a year in the security industry (in the states).

I agree its like an oxymoron, but I'm hoping it will be a good conversation starter.

Lol I was going to post the pic of the actual card, but didn't want to have to edit the personal info and card number out. The design link they sent me once it was approved works just as good as it looks just like that.

So it was originally a snarky remark to poke fun at the FDIC. I already stated it was the banks, or in my analogy the bitcoin banks who pay for the insurance fund.
It's not just for fraud and theft, but financial crisis as well. Who protects your money from the banks and government? 
The FDIC controls the insurance fund that banks pay via premiums yes. If that pool runs dry in a crisis for example, they are backed by the US govt. We live in a debt based system, eventually it will collapse.
You'll have no recourse. When people go to collect their money it won't be there. It never really was, just a faith based system that it would be.
Hopefully I'm off my rocker and its all sunshine and lollipops going forward.

Volatility measures the rate at which a security increases or decreases for a given set of returns. You need to measure the standardized deviations over the annual returns over their lifetimes. Hint: it's not infinite.

The only thing gained from this article is the knowledge that this guy does not understand bitcoin.

Do not use your phone to hold your Bitcoin and you're fine. Do a back up of your phone before you travel (just a good practice in general). 
@_date: 2015-02-15 06:16:11
So basically we just need the bitcoin equivalent of the FDIC. You pay other people to hold your bitcoins, and they pay a premium in bitcoins to the bitcoin fdic. If the pool is not big enough to cover the losses, then we just administratively conjure some more bitcoins into existence to pay the difference! 
It's a perfect system cause you get all your money back every time!
