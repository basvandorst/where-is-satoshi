Something I think the Dogecoin crowd needs to discuss with themselves and their mods is vote-brigading. I could be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure I've seen subreddits get the banhammer for vote brigading in the past. While I think it would be hilarious to see happen to a community who claims to be the pinnacle of "nice friendly community", I think it's only fair someone at least try to warn them before it's too late. However, this is as far as my warning goes. It's up to the dogecoin crowd to police themselves.

To be fair, I doubt the FBI much cares about legitimate uses, and is obviously aware that they are there. They aren't there to write reports on economics. Their interest lies in the illegal activity, regardless of what medium it may be through.

It's not really surprising, actually. A large portion of the gold farming market is funded from fraudulent payments, identity theft, stolen credentials, etc.
I couldn't say how much exactly, and certainly a large portion of the market is "legit" as in they are using little more than bots on legitimately purchased accounts and game-time, but there's no denying that it is there.

I believe it's using TradeHill data in MtGox's absence.
@_date: 2011-06-24 18:16:05
Yes, it is a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:58:10
Definitely not surprised here.
Seems a few redditors have gotten their emails, mostly denials. I seem to be one of the few accepted. [Details here](
Edit: Damnit. Triple posted comments. Let's see how many come through.

You can see there he transfer more than 432k total. The 424242etc amount was only done because it was suggested by someone in the chat.
But yeah, he should've done that in the first place to be honest.
@_date: 2011-06-21 04:44:25
I agree, although I can't say it's surprising. These guys aren't exactly professionals. They got dumped into a huge situation that they were not prepared for (the exchange/BTCs growing massive seemingly overnight). Not trying to excuse them, just saying, it's par for course really. There's no suits to handle PR for them.
@_date: 2011-06-24 03:07:45
Sounds like it could be a while. Tux just said they had 11.5k more claims to review a couple minutes ago on IRC.
@_date: 2011-06-23 04:28:30
He means bring MtGox back online. Although if he did run off with everyone's money, there'd probably be more than a few trying to track him down.
@_date: 2011-06-24 03:10:28
Quite the niche novelty name there
@_date: 2011-06-16 19:55:53
I seem to be unable to log in with Chrome, FF or IE9. Maybe something broke, will try again later I suppose.
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:44:44
Yeah, we'll see what happens. They just delayed another 24 hours.
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:55:51
Yeah. Things were shady as hell before this popped up. If this is to be believed, there's some going to be a lot of unease. 
I just want to be able to access my money.
@_date: 2011-06-25 03:28:30
Normally I'd agree with you (and I do to a point), but the fact that they wait until their first deadline expires or comes close to before they announce their next delay. It just feels extremely sketchy.
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:45:22
I only had 3 or 4 BTC. Although they just delayed another 24 hours. That's a surprise.
@_date: 2011-06-20 23:39:17
So, if you believe MtGox's side of the story, Kevin placed the massive buy order before the sell order was placed. 
Could be why Kevin was trying so hard to convince everyone that he definitely is NOT the hacker no way no how look how sloppy I was!
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:45:28
MtGox guy is on this interview  he mentioned it there. The interviewers are terrible, but that was one small tidbit that we did get.
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:30:59
Mine was approved about 45 minutes ago. I claimed before it was posted on the site, at that time it had only been posted in the IRC so I got in fairly early on the list. I only provided IP as my IP only changes about once every 3 or 4 years. 
@_date: 2011-06-25 03:16:41
Oh, right. I had to go find that link elsewhere after the fact because the previous redirected article would just give me a permission error.
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:48:33
My claim got approved and I'm still convinced my money is gone forever. More delays, more delays.
@_date: 2011-06-23 19:58:51
Agreed. The only place I found mention of it was in their IRC channel. Would be nice to see a small memo on the page itself so we aren't so confused and have to hunt for the information.
@_date: 2011-06-16 22:50:13
I just tried it again (using the Google button, which was what I was using before) and it worked. Before, I'd click the google button, but it would just send me back to the page with no way to proceed. This time, after I pressed the Google button it seems to have sent me to the proper page. I'm not sure what caused the issue, as I haven't even closed my browser since then.
@_date: 2011-06-25 03:25:06
You think they'd have noticed something like that hours ago, and I dunno, fixed it or notified us at that point..
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:47:52
So I commented on this before, briefly. See 
I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's a good deal more challenging, I think. There also exists the possibility of getting shut down by the sites as many people might report it as a scam for not understanding it, etc. Very few sites are as... hands-off? as reddit. I'm more than happy to help brainstorm on the topic, though my programming time is taken by another btc project currently.
Edit: I think the magic formula for this (roughly) is a site that:
1 Allows public comments (for visibility, spreading awareness, what have you) (this one is quite easy, almost all social sites have this functionality)
2 Allows unrestricted (or relatively unrestricted) private messaging for passing along details on how to obtain your newly acquired tips (this is where sites like Twitter fall off with massive restrictions on direct messages)
3 Won't shut you down because they'd rather not deal with the headache (I'm not sure this would ACTUALLY be a problem, but definitely something to be prepared for)
It might not even be difficult to come up with an easier formula that would work on sites that restrict some of the "required" functions that would allow a mimic of the reddit-bot, also.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:26:41
Fair enough. It's just better to be safe than sorry when things seem sketchy. Even if they don't, I just want people to be more careful in here. The last time I saw a scam and didn't speak up, I saw a big upvoted post the next day (that site "selling" PS4s for Black Friday) so maybe I'm feeling a bit paranoid/guilty.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:57:31
I'm not sure if anyone has tried (and been shutdown or not) but it's a slightly more complex issue. You could have the bot monitoring mentions of itself, but then how do you privately send the information to the newly tipped person? There are restrictions on Direct Messages, if I remember correctly. Sending them a tweet saying "hey, follow me so I can give you this magic internet money that someone tipped to you" is.. a bit off-putting, especially to those unfamiliar.
FB might work, since messaging limitations aren't as strict, I think. I'm not terribly familiar with either platform.
Youtube might work, or well, might've worked before the most recent G+ tie-ins. Maybe it still will, I'm not terribly sure. The problem is, last time I used YT in any capacity, I received so many spam messages, I'm not sure I'd believe a message about free magic internet money there, either.
I thought about this very briefly earlier this year. As you can probably guess, I haven't pursued it at all.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:09:37
Just compare the responses in the AMA compared to how this post is typed. There's literally nothing the same except the smiley faces. This is definitely a hacked account.
It doesn't seem that obscure, to be honest. If you can get into a few relatively known peoples Reddit accounts, and start asking for BTC donations.. well, it's about the only way to profit off something as meaningless as a Reddit account.
Until this is verified via Twitter or something, this is 100% a scam.
Edit: A quick cursory glance at her Twitter and YT and I don't see any mentions of any charity drives, but again, quick being the keyword here
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:23:24
This is a good idea. I've been thinking of starting a sub similar to this for a few days. A place for developers to talk shop about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:15:25
The grammar is way off, and there's no mention of a charity drive anywhere, let alone with Bitcoin. Until you see verification on Twitter or YT or something, be wary. This seems like a compromised account.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:37:15
I'm not trying to be a dick, but with the amount of attempted (or otherwise) scamming happening in this subreddit lately, I think everyone can agree that we should be cautious, regardless of if the person is recognized or not. Especially considering a lot of people here are sitting on data they may not be used to securing themselves, which I understand the irony of considering you're trying to help that. Posting source at the very least might not be a terrible idea.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:22:53
and md5 has not been considered secure for many years.
This is one massive security risk for anyone who downloads this.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:18:32
This is not really that surprising, even if you're looking for writing between the lines. Virgin Galactic is a company, and you can't buy space-plane parts in bitcoin (yet?). They have to pay their bills, employees, and keep the business running.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:03:07
Well, keep up the good work. Don't let me raining on your parade stop ya.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:50:28
I will admit, I've never used tumblr so I'm not familiar with it at all, and you're definitely right about Facebook. My FB is purely used for keeping up appearances and I really don't ever use it.
I suppose using a 3rd party retrieval isn't a terrible idea. It hadn't occurred to me, but it would be doable. It creates an extra hurdle of trust in that the other person does have to click an external link, but that can be overcome, especially if it's used among friends who know each other relatively well, at least to start.
Tying into the Twitter API wouldn't be too much to ask, I think, so long as the permissions (it lists permissions requested, right? Been ages since I've dealt with 3rd party Twitter applications) are as minimal as possible. All it would need to do is verify  identity via OAuth/OpenID.
Which, now that I think about it, using a 3rd party landing page could open a lot of doors to making it feasible. Sending a tip, getting a bot to verify it and pointing the user to a site, so long as it looks professional and isn't a scam could go a long way. Most social sites offer OAuth/OpenID support, so verification of identities wouldn't be too much trouble.
If done well, the site could be very basic, yet informative. Use it as, basically, a users first step into Bitcoin. It can have all the relevant information if people want it, for example acquiring, storing, basic security, some suggestions on where to spend, etc.
