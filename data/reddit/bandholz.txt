Woo! 
Anyone want to buy some beard products?

Yup, I agree. Sorry, I misunderstood your primary point.

Let's run some math. The M2 Money Supply right now is 13.8 trillion USD. Let's assume all that money is moved into BTC. Based on the fact there will only be 21 million bitcoin created, then 1 btc would equal $657,000 of USD as we understand the values of currency in 2017. 
So that means, that 1 BTC would theoretically buy whatever $657k would buy you in 2017 USD. When that happens 1 btc may be worth a completely different and arbitrary number. 
Bitcoin isn't just a USA thing though, it's a global thing. So the total broad money is $90.4 trillion. Which if all that were moved to Bitcoin, you'd be looking at valuation of $4 million per coin.  
Here's an source with interesting visualization of the wealth of the world: 
Simply put, the more people use bitcoin and put their wealth into it, the more it's worth.

And estate taxes, and sales taxes, and property taxes, and capital gains taxes, and hundreds of other ways they tax you.

They hate admitting that there are genuine threats of violence against Bitcoin, and the status quo will do everything in their path to stomp out the currency.
They figure if they plug their ears and go "lalallalala" then everything will be ok.

Well, I've reported it and it seems to have been taken down! :D

I'm sure was referring to IBM's consumer products which was the largest at one point but now are now functionally non-existent. 
From people I know to have worked at IBM, they have offices filled with empty desks, mass inefficiencies, huge politics, and other hurdles internally. It's not to say some of their divisions don't innovate; but not at a speed of other companies.

I'm a seller with over $200k of sales on PayPal this year and thousands of orders. It's been great for our business to be able to collect funds from a wide variety of people and get up and running quickly.
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:02:25


I think you meant to say without rulers. There would still be laws and rules within society, they would just be built on a voluntary framework, rather than one of force.
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:12:36
Alright! My first tip. Thank you for that! Been a subscriber on here for a while - mostly lurk.
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:57:33
I'm the owner of [Beardbrand]( and we talked about strategies for Bitcoin, accepting payments, and the general direction of the market.
I just moved to Austin, so I'm trying to meet a lot of different people and Bitcoin is a movement that I am keen on. 
CoinSimple just launched and is building a simpler way to receive payments.

The answer is "yes." If XYZ patent troll acquires a patent related to Bitcoin technology, then sue the best bitcoin merchants out of oblivion. It will totally hurt Bitcoin and pose a real threat to the long term success.
People are ok with volatility for a while. But if every major exchange goes out of business after 2 years; you have a problem. You have to understand the technology built around Bitcoin makes it easier to use for common folks. And if you want mass adoption of the technology; you'll need to protect that.
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:45:12
Eh, I take Bitcoin on my site as well. I'm no PayPal shill. Just pointing out that PayPal offers a pretty good service and if it really was as bad as everyone claims than not one seller would use it.
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:15:53
I'm not sure how others answered this question but for me it's really quiet simple. There are two ways to solve issues.
1. Through the political process
2. Through the free market
In AnCapistan all issues are solved through the free market as it has better indicators what people want. If you are concerned with the monopolization of force, then show me where a company without colluding with the government achieved a monopoly. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:35:51
Yes, that means taking PayPal allows them to make more money. It's obviously good for the business or they wouldn't do it. They'd just take Bitcoin or credit cards or cash/checks.
Is everything perfect with PayPal? No. But the positives out weigh the negatives &amp; the proof is in the pudding.
@_date: 2014-10-20 02:24:50
This sentence has triple negatives. I really don't know what you are saying. :(
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:26:37
Agreed (I fucking hate the patent systems and the general idea of owning something with no scarcity - ideas); but you gotta be pragmatic to grow bitcoin. Having a foundation that protects Bitcoin from the status quo, which wants to bring it down, is a good idea.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:55:52
Man, we've done thousands of transactions with PayPal and the only issue was with an international delivery. We got it taken care of and everything was good.

I'm a USAA member and didn't know about this. Thanks for sharing.

Were they in the service and USAA members? You can only get it if your Father signed you up.
Also, their banking is available to everyone; just not their insurance.

The free market standard. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 13:05:45
Inflation is good for people with debt as the time value of money is weighted in their favor. Deflation is good for people with assets as the wealth they've generated can purchase more over time.
In theory, a stable money system would have a "positive deflation" scenario where prices drop due to efficiencies, but people live a higher standard of life without working more or making more money.
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:49:00
That would be considered barter and they tax for that too. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:51:29
How are they going to know you have good. It's not like the IRS searches your house looking for 40 coins. And if they do, it's easy to hide.
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:18:20
Well, if your debt is at a fixed rate, then higher inflation is good. When debt is variable, it doesn't matter if inflation goes up or down.

My driver was very professional and I have no inclination that he was lying to me. He was telling me how he didn't tip when using Uber as a passenger. He's in the industry and simply had insightful information.
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:33:12
You can request your rating score. It's in the FAQ section.
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:35:10
I can assure you he didn't sucker me as I didn't tip him. I usually talk to Uber drivers about Uber and it's always interesting to get their insight. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:31:43
I talked to an uber driver and they said in the northeast drivers are rating passengers who don't tip lowly. So you won't be able to get a ride eventually with your low score.

They could have also just started off and statistically don't have enough data to garner an accurate number. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 17:39:45
Just read the headline and comments. Thanks for the clarification. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:03:41
Anyone who ever logs into Facebook. They gather your location data, websites you've browsed, and connections you have to figure out all they need to know about you.

They won't be looking at it from a percentage standpoint, i'll be from a numbers standpoint. Here's an example:
    10000k monthly orders
    9900 Legit Orders
    100 Fraud Orders placed through VPNs
    20 Legit Orders placed through VPNs
In this scenario it makes sense to ban VPN because the costs of fraud out weigh the benefits of sales through legit VPN. It's not about some percentage thing - it's all about profit and loss. 
In this example it'd make sense to not ban VPNs.
    10000k monthly orders
    9990 Legit Orders
    10 Fraud Orders placed through VPNs
    40 Legit Orders placed through VPNs
@_date: 2016-02-05 14:16:24
As a merchant it's pretty simple math decision. Look at the number and amount of fraud orders through VPN compared to legit orders through VPN. If the cost of fraud is higher, ban VPNs, if lower keep them.

This is not correct at all. It's saying the owner of Overstock is selling it to someone else (who will run it as they please). The person selling Overstock will then use that capital to invest in blockchain technologies.

Currency shouldn't stimulate investing. It should stand as a foundation for investing in trade. When people can trust the value of a currency then they will feel more comfortable investing. As such, a good currency would be one that is very stable with slight deflation due to the technological improvements of producing products.
A currency with inflation built into it brings malinvestment and excessive investment which creates the boom &amp; bust cycle we currently have.

We will need to develop better tools for criminals to deal with consequences for their actions then.

Fraud is a crime that has a victim. I think you meant to say that no one should go to jail that's done a victimless crime.

It's from my understanding that Bitcoin is backed by a mathematical equation that ensures the validity and quality of the currency. I'm no Bitcoin expert; so others feel free to chime in.

Technically, the federal reserve is a private bank. Regardless, the setup is nothing like free market capitalism and instead corporatism.

Gold has tons of uses my friend; it's just that it's too expensive for a lot of those uses. It's an incredible metal beyond how pretty it is.
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:57:39
I think the point is, they must earn your trust and to have due diligence for investments. It's a wise policy to have for investing in something you don't want to get burned on.

So, after a conversation with fellow redditor of this subreddit and a local bitcoin fan I got my store setup with Bitcoin. We run on Shopify and the integration with BitPay was surprisingly easy. (which was a requirement for me).
I haven't tested it with any orders; so if things aren't working let me know and I'll try to fix it. Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:51:51
No worries and thank you for the feedback. What I currently have up is the standard Shopify build, so I've gotta play around with it to see what additional features I can provide.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:54:00
I don't think you understand my point. I could make a house out of gold if the price is low enough. 
Its a fucking great metal, but its rare. There are downsides to it, just like there are downsides to everything in life. 
If you are planning for an apocalypse than a digital currency won't be too valuable because it needs electricity.
We'll never hit that level though. Humans always make life better in the long run. In the short run we may have hiccups. Gold is a good metal to hold because of the historic value, just like silver and even copper to an extent. When trade exists, currencies are far more efficient than bartering.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:52:09
Yup. Through FedEx.
