I argee with this.  I would donate but converting the funds to USD will take them out of the bitcoin ecosystem.  Offer him Bitcoin first, if he refuses give to a charity that will keep them in BTC.  This is just like sell out BTC for USD.  That's what I don't agree with!

If I plug the network cable in there is nothing inside connecting it.  I am not sure how to connect it on the inside.

But wouldn't this still fuel that ideology?  I mean he will never admit to being the real Satoshi, so we can still believe in a "mythological Satoshi" while newcomers to bitcoin will believe the news and see how humble he is.  They can see that the Top 1% of bitcoiners aren't in it for the profits.

Great thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:20:19
Thanks! I will try that
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:14:46
I did have a plan but it fell through.
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:12:58
No, it can with very basic mounting directions 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:19:00
They did, it is just taking a while to go through all the levels of proper authorization.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:09:23
This is good advice but I want to have a place for it. That's what I am looking for now
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:08:38
It is Lamassu, I did but they have not responded at all yet
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:06:40
How do you make a redeem code?  I tried sending it to the other mtgox btc address but no luck. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:48:30
by falling through I mean it is going to take a long time
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:45:54
I send you a message.  Please let me know if you got it.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:58:17
I sent you another email
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:09:09
The only problem is that I need a place to put it...
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:38:44
Sorry I was supposed to post this here. I know her pretty well and I bought a pair of slippers from her before the website. I can assure you it is not a scam.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:19:03
Yes, she does take local payment in cash or bitcoin :)  You can go see for yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:57:41
I just upvoted you god bless
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:43:01
I know her personally &amp; I actually went to the physically location and bought a pair of slippers there. Believe me it is fully legit. I am going to see her and ask her to register on reddit. Also anyone who buys a pair will be contacted by her concerning size and color and which bitcoin logo. Her address is listed there and has been on google maps for a really long time.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:56:04
I just upvoted you.  God bless

I need these changes:
The image by the twitter box is missing so we need to fix that (simple)
Needs a new color scheme something Less bright the text is kinda hard to see, Needs more contrast, Maybe the background color change?
When you hover over the games it needs to fade out the image but not the form (if you fade out form fields then it makes them look unchangeable) when you click on the image up top it needs to open up a lightbox with maybe a picture to but more text about how the game works
Contact us page is missing a lot of info and we should add a contact us form  there that sends us emails when its filled out
The header image and the slideshow on the front page are both too tall  we should make them shorter so you can see the content sooner (hopefully without scrolling :P)
Lets add more content on the what is bitcoin page, and embed the weusecoins video straight into the page
More stuff to be added to faq page like how the payouts are calculated.
Add a fee page that list our fees.
On the pages where there is a sidebar like the results page the sidebar is below the content module we need to make those level.
The biggest winners page should be a subpage of results rather than a subpage of a subpage it looks weird the way it is now.
On the games page we need to center the games right now there on the left, looks like its expecting a sidebar but because we don't have one on the games page it should be centered, Also the lightbox isn't working (and as mentioned before it should have text and images)
When you switch between the demo and the normal games it shows both games rather than just one (you may have to switch multiple times to recreate this).
the submenu items for games don't work, Binary looks like its working but its not really, its just reloading the page and the page loads with the binary game on the front.
part of the switch between demo and normal is cut off 
The form fields on the games need to be formatted to be more even

The most common misconception about Bitcoin is this talk about a bubble; mainly, this tulipmania Bitcoin analogy that the naïve and ignorant use without knowing anything at all about Bitcoin.  How do you equate Bitcoin to a tulip? Have these people done their research?  Beside from looking pretty a tulip has no functionality at all.  Bitcoin has a function that the whole worlds yearns for and needs in order to advance past wars , atrocities caused by the corruption of government in many third world countries, and the loss of control over your own money.  What can a tulip do?  It certainly cannot send value over the internet in a matter of seconds with little or no fees at all.  And the best part is you can do this without trusting any third party.
So true...
“Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.”  Again, I find that intrinsic value is derived by its functionality.  It is the network or individuals that mine, secure and verify each transaction that gives Bitcoin its intrinsic value.   It is now a household name in the virtual currency world.  It is tried, tested and true.  The seed has already been planted and nothing can take away from its intrinsic value.  It is a well-established entity, fantastic store of value and the best part is that it is all run by “untrusting” individuals that act as a benevolent community to make the whole system work.  Nothing like this has ever existed and this is why Bitcoin has intrinsic value and is here to stay.

I actually went to the physically location and bought a pair of slippers there. That is why I posted the link.  Believe me it is fully legit. I am going to see her and ask her to register on reddit. Would that make you feel better?
