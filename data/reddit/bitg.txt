I suppose nobody uses ubuntu.
Imagine having the audacity to actually embrace FOSS:  download the source from github, learn it, review it, tweak it and build it (followed by a pull request featuring your tweaks).

I understand they used bitpay so received dollars regardless of the payment method.
Unless they've reinvested it all and speculated on bitcoin there won't be any profit in performing a full refund (bASIC style).

I've ordered a single which it now seems will come as two mini-singles and be shipped after all the jally's.
At this point I barely keep up with news and it looks like BFL have given up even estimating when they will ship (lol @ "shipping" a unit to luke-jr).
Additionally, I see the recent price bump as a mechanism to lock in the remaining pre-orders and doubt it will stay at that price for long after shipping (if their manufacturing claims aren't as much BS as their shipping estimates).

Good thing it's still beta and nobody's invested much money in bitcoins.  ^^

You should go on  on freenode.
They should be better at pointing our people.

Yes, by deleverage I mean sell off and leave the bitcoin game.
I was under the impression at least a proportion of mined coins are hoarded for speculation so there may still be a substantial value in their hands.
While a miner is actively mining they'll be at least partially aware of general bitcoin developments as well as fiat exchange rates.  You are correct that they will have seen their hoard grow pleasantly over time although they will have also probably seen large drops in the exchange rates.  If they are selling off their mining operation, speculation on bitcoin may not be as appealing as the security of precious metals.
I don't see this as a very probable event but it would be callous to overlook it entirely.

What part of this is supposed to be informative?
The fact their minirig lacks the chips they're still to receive?
If this was really a scam why wouldn't they use their FPGA singles in the "new" minirig and just have their internally created android mining app report BS figures?
"look guys, we have it working, sadly these chips have a flaw and will burn out within the week"

What about the possibility of defunct GPU miners deciding to deleverage from the bitcoin market?
This potentially opens up large hoards of previously untraded bitcoins.

Are there any pictures of the single sc opened up like this?
If they contain the guts then there's really no need to have 12 of them sitting in a box to explain the minirig concept.

Yea, that was an impressively obtuse statement.
The west's reliance on MS products is mainly just familiarity:
* Mr Smith already knows Excel, Word and Outlook and would rather play a round of golf than look into FOSS.
* Most offices seem to be locked into Active Directory so will always have an MS presence.
China's nouveau rich aren't hampered by this.
Is windows 8 really worth three quarters of a bitcoin more than *nix?
