All transactions are done on a open public searchable ledger (aka the blockchain) which in turn provides validity and provablity (and vise versa) to each transaction.  
The down side (if you call that a downside) of that is that each transaction is searchable such has etherscan.io.  There is great benefit of having a public, searchable record for most use cases.
Almost all blockchains are open and public (bitcoin, litecoin, Ethereum, etc.)
The exception right now is Monero. There transactions are 100% anonymous. And the dark web is switching to that, which benefits all their sometimes illegal needs.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:20:49
Everyone can we see everyone's transactions with Bitcoin. 
Which is kinda the one and thing I don't like about crypto.  
If and when crypto becomes norm.... it will be impossible to hide any money.
You know that secret stash of safety cash you got locked in your gun vault? Not possible.  Someone will know. Or how you paid cash for that boat for your company and didn't pay your taxes on it. Not possible.
That's the ONE thing I don't like. 
But then again, there is one crypto that is completely untraceable (for now) that has complete privacy for transactions.  And that's Monero.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:15:03
No it's not.

Ok. So if the economy collaspes then I'm good cause I'm invested in Bitcoin. And if the whole world collapses and it becomes the one world currency then I'll be really fuckin good cause bitcoin will be worth ballizions.
If bitcoin collapses then I'm good cause I have a savings account and I'll lose my inital investment in Bitcoin. Big whoop.
I'll take my chances and invest in not only bitcoin but all cryptos like I have been doing.

It can be both. But yes, in my opinion, think of it (if you were around) when the internet was being formed.  The internet was basically a bunch of individuals and folks within institutions in the early 80s (basically us now in crypto) that started building on and sharing the technology throughout the 80s (ICO's, all these crypto apps, companies.) They were the lunatic fringe back then. Remember, it really was just last year that all these ICOs exploded. Bitcoin has PROVEN itself for almost ten years already!
It wasn't until the mid to late 90s say when AOL (which was formed in the "lunatic era" early to mid 80s) really started getting big that the internet and peoples interest in it took off.  Those late .com era through the 2000s they were early adopters. Amazon, Google, etc...
Now the internet is so engrained in our lives we can't even think of life without it.
I agree with A.A. completely, we are definitely still in the lunatic era, imo. Juuuuuust on the beginning edge of hitting early adoption.

He's a convicted scam artist talking about honest people being hurt. Oh, the irony. LOL. Which because a movie was made about him, gets a voice. We really need to not give these people a voice, these criminals.

No way.  Andreas Antonopoulos recently gave a lecture and stated that the cryptocurrency market is about 25 million people that have ever used a cryptocurrency, of any kind. Worldwide.  World population is what???
He also considers us as the "lunatic fringe" still, and the "early adopters" haven't even started yet.

When layer 2 applications hit (Lightning, etc..) blocktimes wont matter. And fees will be minimal.
One of the Devs for Myriadcoin explained to me about this on Myriads subbreddit. He's worked with Lightning and sees it as the closest to instant payments you can get.
He put a proposal out for Myriad to actually INCREASE its blocktimes gradually over time due to incoming layer 2 solutions. In turn helping with security, chainindex bloat, and orphaned blocks... at least for XMY.
Kinda interesting. Those guys know their stuff.

You should learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works. If you don't, that's your problem -- you'll be sorry someday. Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to hate yourself later.
@_date: 2019-03-29 23:06:33
The difference now vs the others; the public knows.  BTC is displayed in a lot of places, right up there with regular stocks. More and more are using it.  And once people understand its gonna be more and more scarce...good night. 
When it starts having a solid consectutive run up  the shit is gonna blast off. And I mean blast off.  I really dont think 100k is an stupid estimation.
@_date: 2019-03-21 04:24:01
Well first off, Bitcoin does update its security.  Vunerabilities and exploits are found and fixed.  And in doing so, secures itself even more.
As for your question, what do you mean "bitcoin accounts?" Like a bitcoin wallet?

Fake headlines that he "lost" custody of his kids.
His kids were living with him during the divorce and up to the custody case exclusively from what I gathered reading through documents and the bs. His wife sued him for custody of the kids. The jury awarded joint custody of the kids. One juror was interviewed and said both parents were good parents.
If a joint custody between the mother and father of the kids is "losing" then I guess I dont know what losing is.

I just watched the full episode Alex had about Joe Rogan, Jack Dorsey, and Bitcoin. You can watch the full show on infowars.com in videos for the Feb 4th show. It starts around 32:30 of the episode.
Mind you, during the JRE, Jack Dorsey stated that he didnt even know what Alex did to ban him from Twitter. 
What Alex said is that for years JR has been telling people hes a believer in Bitcoin.  Buy bitcoin, etc...
Jack sold at the top of Bitcoins run apprently.  Now, all the sudden JR has Jack on his show.  Pushing bitcoin again, now that square cash (owned by Jack) is now accepting bitcoin.  But low and behold, which Joe never has said on the show, nor during THIS episode (and Dorsey doesnt even say he owns it himself during the show), that Square is actually a paid sponsor of the Joe Rogan Experience. And that Rogan gets 300k a month from Jack.  He said he going come out with more about Rogan.  That Joe is pushing a security (bitcoin) without telling people that his sponsor is a pusher of the securities.  Which is illegal in the regular financial world.
Now Alex thinks Bitcoin is nothing but a pump and dump.

"Just" having to break ANY key would take decades with a quantum computer.
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:44:22
It would require somewhere around 1500 qubits from what I've heard. It's not a threat to Bitcoin in anyway now.
But even if there was a machine powerful enough by the time that happens, Bitcoin would have already adapted.  Somewhat the way it went from CPU and GPU to ASIC. 
It would have to break a key in the time it takes a transaction to find a block.  And that would nearly impossible for any quantum computer that rolls out over the upcoming decades.

No I wanna go there and take a pic and laugh and post it to Reddit. Lol
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:36:40
I would argue that there really isnt a limited supply of gold. There is a limited amount of Gold that WE KNOW of and found.  But gold to this day is still being created by the Earth and new reserves are being mined by humans.
Just like how oil is still being made by the Earth and then "omgosh we found a new reserve that can power the whole planet for another 100 years," then processed by humans.
I dont quite understand why people think that oil and gold are finite resources that were made billions of years ago and that's it. The Earths geological processes are still active. Lol
Unless you mean limited in a different way... which then i have no clue

At this point, sure. But Bitcoin is adaptable.  And will adapt as long as the network reaches consensus and adopts new tech. The fundamentals are not changeable.
I would not be surprised in less than 1 to 2 years, on boarding into cyrpto will be easy.
I'm very interested to see what does with his FunFair casino platform over the next couple months.  They have a fast, fair, instant play and reward, LIVE product right now utilizing Ethereum.  And innovated one of the first state channels as their own.  The casino platform works and you can play the games just like you walk into a casino now. And as quick, if not quicker.
But onboarding your funds is NOT easy for the average person. And in a recent interview, he stated that him and his team realize this and have immediately begun working on providing that.   I think that if they can innovate this, which I have zero doubt they will achieve,  it could be a total game changer for all of crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:16:26
It will replace it.  It will shift the world from a debt based society to a value based society.

One of the active members/devs of Myriad's reddit helped developed a slick wallet that actually is a hot wallet (short term storage) and a cold wallet (long term storage.) You need a 2nd phone you dont use and no active connection for the cold wallet though. But you control the keys.
I use it for my hoarde of Myriad and I love it.  Gonna get it for my Bitcoins as well.
Look up CoinID in the Play Store.

Yup. Ask the Venezuelans how their dollar is doing.
Oh,  a 1.7 million% inflation rate.
And you wonder why the people are buying Bitcoin up like hot cakes there?
Even if they bought at BTCs all time high of 20k and since its crash, they still would be better off then leaving their money in their fiat.  
Just cause the US dollar hasnt collapsed (even though its purchasing power has decreased 95% since its inception) yet, doesnt mean other places arent seeing one of the numerous values Bitcoin brings to society.
What I believe you are seeing echos what Tim Draper said, you are seeing fiat currencies being volatile toward BTC.  Its adoption is inevitable.
