i originally bought Trezor One, i only use it now for its password manager (which is great)
I quickly bought a Nano S though within a month or 2 of getting hands on with the trezor , and now use the Nano all the time, the wallet interface is much nicer, and i like having all my holdings displayed, where ETH / ERC-20 tokens on the trezor arent shown on dashboard (you have to use mew with trezor just used as the entry point which i found annoying) - with the Nano S i can see exactly what all of my holdings are upto straight away from the ledger live dashboard.
if your only holding top cryptos then trezor (plus bonus of password manager) is a great choice, you said its only for BTC so Trezor would suit fine (guess depends on costs of both these days - i dont know how pricey they are)
if you have plans to add other holdings down the line i'd go nano for full portfolio visibility. the Nano feels a better/higher quality product as well.. i wouldnt carry a trezor anywhere (if it was in my pocket id be fearful of breaking it, the nano s is robust) - talking of mobility... the mobile app for trezor (manager) is sh\*te, and its just a gateway to use mycelium etc, where nano s has its own wallet app.

i just started throwing BAT to my ledger recently (not invested, just what ive been sent for using Brave browser), but it's nice to see it in the wallet portfolio all the same

that's a good point, to be honest ive never tried (wfh so always near a PC for banking etc so i dont really use my phone other than for calls) -&gt; the Trezor password manager is a chrome extension, im not sure if thats even compatible on mobile os?
I guess you'd have to try and remember the passwords that trezor generates for you (*if you use that function*), but they are difficult to remember - it generates random 16 char passwords (inc. special characters).
