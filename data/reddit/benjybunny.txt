So since "*the utility of bitcoin is, quite obviously, vastly superior to that of the USD, and all government issued currencies for that matter*" what is the intrinsic value of 1 BTC again?
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:33:41
This is a common misconception about fiat - confusing the symbol of a dollar bill with the value it represents. The paper itself is worthless, but it represents the intrinsic value of the system that issues it: the ability of the US government to raise taxes under threat of punishment and issue securities underpinned by that cashflow, all backed by the means to defend itself and it's assets through significant military force. 
BTC has another kind of intrinsic value, based on the set of *functionalities* it represents. The bits themselves are worthless digital dust, but each alphanumeric string represents a system that has intrinsic value, just like the dollar.

It not a lot of money. So the trick is leveraging it to achieve a specific result. 
The first step is defining what impact you want to have. This would then indicate the right channels to effect that result.
So what does Bitcoin actually need?
- brand awareness?
- reputational enhancement?
- political support?
- institutional support?
- usage growth?
- support for bitcoin core?
- defeat of B2X?
Define which one you want to drive and you almost automatically decide on the pathways that can have that impact.

I said "pollutes the ecosystem" not "dilutes the value".

Sure, but I'm not really pushing against the whole SegWit2x discussion, it's more a coding elegance question. Most modern system may have a hard limit based on datatype limits (byte, double) but not arbitrary hardcoded limits if they could be adjusted dynamically based on some examination of load or similar. I'm not arguing for B2X, I'm just curious about the philosophy of hard limits in general.

OK so can we do a small calculation of intrinsic value?
If you accept my argument that each dollar represents a fraction of the value created by the US system of enforcement, then each single dollar = the value of the system at some point in time / the no. of dollars the system issues. Right? Let's not argue about explicit values - just the equation is enough.
So the same must be true for BTC. The intrinsic value of each is the value of the functionality at some point in time / the no. of BTC issued. We know the latter is 16.6m, so all we have to do is assign a valuation to what the system is worth. There are several ways to estimate: What would someone be willing to pay for that system? What would it cost to replicate it? What is the value of a comparable system, perhaps with same scale and speed but different functions? MasterCard has a market cap of US$151B. Is that a good benchmark? It's a start. So US$151B divided by 16.6m = US$9000 (that's circular in that we are back  to USD comparisons again but you see my logic). You could also look at Visa (US$240B) or Western Union (US$9B), or anything else that offered rapid global secure payment functionality.
Is that fair? What would you sell the entire BTC system for, if that were possible?      
This is how I would assign a core value to BTC for what it represents. It's not arbitrary, it's analytical.

I agree. Many people don't value it for itself, but for what it delivers when exchanged for something more "real".
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:26:40
I do understand FX. What I mean is that that comparison seems to be the main point rather than the underlying intrinsic value of the coin for what it does and what it enables.
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:33:04
Isn't that the situation today anyway? What amateur has a chance of mining coins on the BTC chain today?

I am aware that currencies can be compared to each other, but this doesn't tell anyone the underlying value of a BTC. 
What I am suggesting is that the value of the underlying BTC utility is not being valued in these continuous comparisons back to USD (or whatever). 
"To the moon", "just passed $4300!!" etc. just indicates that people are speculating on what this currency will buy them in "real" money, and not using it because of the intrinsic value it delivers. 
Intrinsic value refers to the value of an asset determined through fundamental analysis, *without reference to a comparative market value*. 
Since you seem to be very clued in and willing to help me learn, can you tell me the intrinsic value of 1 BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:02:40
I absolutely agree with you that that will help BTC grow.
My main concern is that the current comparison is detrimental to that eventual adoption because it fails to value BTC for what it is, rather than what it would be if converted.
The core value of BTC is not that it's worth X dollars or Euros, it's the value created by decentralization of the BTC currency, and to some degree the pseudonymity it enables (if, like chicken fancying, you value that aspect). 
The decentralization through  the trust engendered in the blockchain and network is the crux of BTC, and what it enables standalone is the true intrinsic value of the asset.     
If you look at currencies like the Swiss Franc, that has value intrinsically because of a stable system in which to store value and the ability to generate tax revenues from large bank deposits - most Swiss tax revenue is from this wealth tax source, not income or commerce taxes - to support it. That's the intrinsic value that makes it worth anything more than paper and ink.

How do you pay $25 in BCH? By the time you are ready to send the BCH it's now just $23... $21... $19... Oh shit.

Don't confuse decentralization with democracy. 
It's *de facto*. Nobody anointed them.

Good question. I am about to move soms BTC off Xapo to a Ledger Nano S, would also like to know. Marginal to core BTC value but hey, 10% is 10%.

It's not an equity / security so there are no insider trading laws that apply. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:54:24
Ok, that is another way to view and value it, but is more open to interpretation because it's not a direct functionality, it's an assumption of equivalence to some other unit. But let's see where it leads.
There have been 187,000,000 kilos of gold mined to date, or roughly 10 X the no. of bitcoin that will be mined. So let's say that BItcoin is digital gold, and based on releative scarcity / volume as a store of value is worth 10% of all gold. A kilo is worth US$40k, so a BTC should have about that value too as we get to the steady state, if that is how people view it.
Again, it's not so much what you choose to place in the numerator, it's the logic that underpins the way people think about BTC as an asset. For me all the excitement around rising US$ value is misplaced if we don't have a yardstick for how accurate that valuation is, based on analysis. If we don't have a view on what it is really worth by itself, the comparison is just vapor.

Yes I understand that. What I mean is that the growth in value of the coin in the "real" currency (whatever it is) seems to be the main point of that comparison, rather than understanding why that value has merit.

Absolutely not true. All I did is add the Wikipedia link. The text is unchanged. You would be better off apologizing than doubling down on your error.

Interesting idea. A decentralized blockchain exchange is a very strong application of the tech - and inserts the miner mining the exchange blocks into the middle of **all** future cash flows. The way people get really staggeringly rich is leeching small amounts out of continuous streams of massive cashflows. Of course you would need fast execution i.e. large blocks, lower difficulty but that's fine if you're mining long term for relatively fixed rewards. All the halvening on coin issuance isn't needed any more.

You can value the chicken in isolation for what it brings you: eggs and meat, maybe companionship if you are a chicken fancier.
That's my point. The constant comparison seems to be only about saying "wow I can convert this chicken into real money at this rate!", rather than valuing the chicken for the products it gives you. There seems to be little valuation of the intrinsic utility of a BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:45:46
The comparison seems to be the main point, rather than the valuing of the underlying intrinsic worth of the coin for what it does and what it enables. Intrinsic value is not measure comparatively.
