Great. Of course it goes without saying that nobody will actually use bitcoin if they have to do research just to know how to stop their money from getting stolen.
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:17:00
The truth is neither here nor there, the question is whether bitcoin is a symbol of peace.

If it weren't for bitpay, my business wouldn't take Bitcoin.
You can't expect businesses that operate on thin margins to be ok with leaving a chunk of their takings in a form as volatile as bitcoin.

So, what, 0.0001% of people?

*quacks like a duck.
ducks don't talk. Well, most of them...

Bitcoin is far, far too volatile and young for a company like apple to accept. Apple has always taken it's time with new technology, for better or worse. Them not accepting BTC can hardly be called a criticism.
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:24:33
Absolutely bonkers. I'm pretty well off and the reason i don't really use BTC is the volatility.

Evan Davies is usually good, he approaches with an open mind but a critical one at the same time.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:04:39
This still puts me off to be honest. 3.2 cents for every transaction is a lot when i don't pay a dime for stuff through my bank. Or at least i think that's how a lot of people who don't know bitcoin might see it
@_date: 2014-05-06 00:57:49
What's the issue? We don't all live in the US.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:10:44
I don't think it is. Would my 99.99 headphones be 99.42 or 98.20 with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:51:19
You'd rather  a 99%-er? You get money by being good at what you do.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:57:28
90% of my net worth is in a pizza box. I'm quite poor.

It was meant to be the answer to ASIC-prone scrypt coins. You could only use GPUs because the idea was that the algorithm changed slightly over time.
The most of it went on GPUs, but he chose to sell when every other GPU miner did so he got less than half of what he payed. The other stuff like mining-oriented motherboards just got trashed.

You could be my flatmate who spent almost £20k on equipment to mine Vertcoin, being absolutely positive that it would be the next big thing.

In the UK it's usually around 40GB, then unlimited. I don't know anybody - young or old - with limited broadband.
ISPs will however kick you off the network for hosting a Bitcoin node or Tor relay.

The concept of everybody getting effectiy paid to be alive. What with the rise of automation and AI it's going to be a fact of life at some point.

Maybe because he's apposed to abortion and gay marriage, supports voluntary vaccinations because, quote "I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines".

Doesn't matter whether what he thinks will go into practice, the fact that he thinks it makes me not like him. I'll gove him that he's got principles, but I personally think some issues need a middle ground. I'm a big supporter of Bitcoin, but I think that allowing education to go into the hands of parents and local conmunities is dangerous.

...Poe's law.
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:33:27
I'm not saying i like it. i'm just saying that handing it off to parents and communities is *not* the solution. I personally have learned a lot more about coding from Code Academy than i did at school, so i knew where the idea is coming from.
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:31:18
I just don't think parents and communities can be trusted with something so nebulous as education. Bitcoin is an absolute; it's just like any other currency in a lot of ways.

R/Bitcoin deserves it.

Are you kidding? Comments about changing block size are banned for literally no reason.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:08:03
Very true. Friend of mine insists that people getting into BTC now are noobs or people who don't know shit about tech, but all things considered they're well below the ground floor.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:01:38
See i'd make a joke if i even really knew what bits were :)
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:24:33
Not if that wizard add keeps running. I came here because of that and i haven't the faintest iota of any knowledge of how this stuff works.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:13:14
Wow. I probably should have actually googled that 5 years ago instead of wondering what a megabit was. Thanks :p

What your analogy is analogous to is copyright infringement in the general sense, not hosting copyright infringing content.
@_date: 2016-07-22 18:12:42
But it's still worthy of being illegal though, however you label it.
@_date: 2016-07-22 18:16:57
It's not a crime, simple as that. Procuring or using the information might well be, but viewing a list of credit card numbers is neither a criminal act in and of its self, or aiding and abetting one.
