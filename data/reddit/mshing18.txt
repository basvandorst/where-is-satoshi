Of course there is a chance. There are buyers in the wings and they will make a move at some point &amp; when they do, it will take off. Annndd it will fall, it’s what markets do. Just how far down &amp; how far up is the mystery.

Imagine all the countries they will sell your coinbase info to. Every bit of your privacy is up for sale for a price with FB.

Exactly. And I agree w fun. The heavily invested can make themselves sick, but if they only invest what they understand they can lose, much easier to stomach...and enjoy the show!

Could this be why someone on here a few days ago seemed desperate to buy Walmart cards in bulk?
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:48:22
That is easily stated in hindsight. What if when it was at 18k it went to 50k? Would buying then have been a bad move?

Imagine if (each Satoshi) was (worth) what we can do with (a dollar) today. Figure out how much would your Bitcoin be worth.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:53:19
A second the $3-5k range. No less than $3500.

Time is a social construct. We are lead to believe time is linear, but we are in a loop...past, present, future happening all at once. Bitcoin in the future is larger than it was in the past, but none so much as the present. Buy some today...for it’s the past (giving you the opportunity to buy) and the future.

Seems like a good way to find out who is keeping their coins on these. Amiright?

What everyone thinks, or does? Thinking doesn’t change anything outside of the mind. Action, now that’s different.

Let’s agree to check back in three months, which seems like a lifetime in the crypto world.

No, I didn’t. There is no time. Or space for that matter.

He won’t comment on it. But you can bet he not only understands it, but has a portion of his fortune in it. If you think otherwise, get your head out of the sand....or better yet, expand the bubble you are in...respectfully.

If you want to just put it aside but have these concerns, do something like check on it twice a year like on your birthday &amp; New Year’s for piece of mind.

Question afor ya-  If Trezor device is lost or stolen but you can access the coin w/o physical device by using the recovery seed, can you just check to see the seed works that way &amp; if so, update w/o worry you would lose access to your coin in an update?

The problem often read on this site saying they can’t use an exchange or others who want to exchange their currency for bitcoin but the whole process is overwhelming &amp; basically just want some to hold.

Whenever you start seeing something get plastered all over any media, including this one &amp; your “bell” goes off, trust it. This is a propaganda campaign. This diverts attention. Recognize this &amp; search for the important news elsewhere. Talking points whether msm or on social media are for coordinated distraction!!

Thanks for that link

Here’s an idea- set a goal...how much btc do you want to acquire, short term, as in maybe 12 months? Have another goal, maybe 1-3 years &amp; a long term goal maybe 10 years. Then acquire that amount until you have it, don’t compare it to fiat. Just acquire it until you reach your goal. It will go up. It will go down. But it’s not going away. Change your goals &amp; you won’t fall apart with comparing it to the very thing (fiat or your country’s currency) that you agree is going to be obsolete in the very near future. Change your thoughts, change your life. Then you can be happy when it’s up..weeeee &amp; happy when it’s down...time to add to the coffers, life is good!

Charts like this should remind us that anyone can make a chart or write an article about anything they want.

That would solve the problem for all the posters that for whatever reason seem to have difficulty getting bitcoin. Example would be offer an ebook that is normally $10,  they pay more than that, just say $50, and get a transaction back of $40 worth of bitcoin.

Yes, good point. It seems like it’s so cumbersome to use as a currency now, but someday..of course to get it there it will take both spenders &amp; savers.

Andreas’ latest YouTube also reminds us to be sure to use latest software, use a passcode on wallet &amp; phone, &amp; don’t use the same passcode. Go watch &amp; secure your coins.

Every individual can be on any point on the chart. If you are counting on bitcoin to be the future currency and believe in it, but need time ( because of lack of resources) to keep accumulating it, you don’t mind when it’s going down, or getting cheaper.  If you watch the process for a few months, you can keep your emotions in check...how these emotions control when value skyrockets when you have some vs how you feel if you don’t are found on different points on the chart depending if you hold bitcoin or not.
