All visa has to do is add a "bitcoin currency" to their lineup. Just like they process USD, CAD, AUD, etc, they can also process XBT. Therefore bitcoin would piggyback on their super fast network. And just like at the end of the day the credit card processing companies send money to the merchants from the days sales, they can do the same thing with bitcoin.

Closure of exchanges doesn't stop you from using your bitcoins.
The price jumps are because the market cap is so tiny so it's easy to manipulate.

How would you know if some billionaire just bought a bunch of coins directly off some Chinese miner? Or directly off bitpay? Or off some early adopter? The sellers probably cut deals at a few % above spot and grt instant wire transfers so they dont have to deal with all the Bs of moving the stuff through exchanges. I mean if I was a miner and wanted to sell btc daily, having daily wire transfers directly to my bank account would be a big benefit.
 If the things dont happen on the big exchanges, they dont raise the price which is precisely what you'd want to do if trying to amass as much as possible for cheap.

If a country prints as much money as the US has printed, their money would become worthless, and cause their economy to collapse. Look at zimbabwe and their trillion dollar bills that are worth pennies.
Because the USA currency is used in the entire world, them printing a ton of money does devalue their currency, but because the entire world is using it, this devaluation isn't really significant. 
They need wars so that the rulers of other countries will keep using USD to trade. Gaddafi wanted to start using gold to trade oil..look what happened to him. They also need wars to distract the population from problems at home. 
If other countries stop using the USD for trade - like what Russia/China want to do, the US dollars will be sent back to America, increasing their supply, devaluing their dollar, beginning the economic collapse.

Why fail? The stuff he laid out is very simple and makes a lot of sense.
* 8MB max block size  (chinese miners were unhappy with 20 for not-entirely-clear reasons)
* Earliest fork date 11 Jan 2016 (miners and others want sooner rather than later)
* Activation when 750 of last 1,000 blocks are up-version (version 0x20000004 to be compatible with sipa's new versioning bits scheme)
* 2 week 'grace period' after 75% threshold reached before first &amp;gt;1MB block allowed to be mined
* 8MB cap doubles every two years (so 16MB in 2018, etc:  unless there is a soft fork before then because 16MB is too much)
Seems like an easy fix and has doubling built in, even a grace period for people to switch to &gt;1mb clients.

Buy off market on places like bitpay, off miners, etc, then keep dumping a small % of btc on the market to keep the price low so you can get as many coins as you need for cheap.
This is literally the only explanation I can think of for all this VC investment and good news and the price staying so low.
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:05:48
Because grandmas and grandpas and hedge funds and people who want to defer taxes could easily with a few clicks buy bitcoins with the ETF.

Difficulty retarget algo of Nxt makes it almost impossible to outpace the legit chain. Alice would have a very narrow window she have to hit targets in. If she generates blocks faster then difficulty grows higher and she have to spend a lot of computing power. If she generates blocks slower then cumulative difficulty won't be high enough. Difficulty of her blocks must bounce around difficulty of blocks from the legit chain. The most interesting thing is that her last rewritten block must be generated at time very close to time of the last block in legit chain, otherwise other nodes will notice the gap and throw a message that most part of the peers is on another branch. Well, this is a part of advanced consensus rule that is supposed to be kept in secret until we get 100% TF...

This is the crazy tinfoil hat conspiracy that I'm thinking.
The US government wants to buy as many bitcoins as possible so that if/when bitcoin becomes huginormous, they will not be left in the dust. How do you do that without driving the price to the moon?
Buy off market straight from the huge mining pools and early adopters.
Then sell a fraction of what you just bought ON the market to keep the price down.
This way you can maintain a steady price or even lower it over the years that you want to hoard up as many bitcoins as needed.
Which is why I think the price is behaving so erratically.

What you're describing is some sort of proof of stake system. Since the nodes don't actually have to do anything rather than just be turned on and connected. This brings other problems, how will the bank verify the nodes that they're not screwing around with transactions? What if someone fakes a million nodes? And what's the point of even doing this from the banks point of view? It gives them no benefits. Since they will still have to be the central authority to verify transactions.

"We've done a lot of work on the ruble-yuan swap deal in order to facilitate trade financing. I have a meeting next week in Beijing," she said casually and then dropped the bomb: "We are discussing with China and our BRICS parters the establishment of a system of multilateral swaps that will allow to transfer resources to one or another country, if needed. A part of the currency reserves can be directed to [the new system]."

Russians don't have many mortgages. Most live on apartments passed down from generations. Most also have dachas (like a cottage) that are also from their parents/grand parents. A very small minority do have mortgages so those will feel the burn. But mostly this will hit businesses with loans.

Yep and thats the great thing with PoS currencies. After bad guys spent X amount of dollars to try to attack them, if the currency forks or another comes around, they have to spend more and more money to keep attacking them, thereby running out at some point.
With PoW, the bad guys simply point miners to the new currency and kill it, no need to spend more money. So PoS is way more resilient in this regard.

Why would a person 5 years from now go to a bank, open accounts, pay fees, put up with slow transfer times, be under lots of terms and conditions, only be able to send and receive money from people/entities the bank is OK with? When they could download an app and send money to anyone anywhere in seconds nearly for free?
The next generation of young people will look at us using banks like we look at old people using the library. Yes banks will still have utility with loans, but other than that they are done for.
And also, regarding the free market and manipulation, if bitcoin gets to the world stage with a market cap of trillions, who is going to manipulate it? It's not like the US dollar or paper gold that the higher ups can print billions of and dump on the market. Look at gold. The only way to manipulate it is by selling off paper contracts.

I think it would depend on the type of collapse.  In a ussr style collapse where society still functions to some extent,  as long as the Internet stays on people will use bitcoin. If us dollar collapses,  people will want to use something else. And since many other currencies depend on usd economy they too will collapse.  This will leave physical gold,  other metals and bartering to transact in the local economy and bitcoin (since banks and payment providers will probably  go out of business)  to transact over distances,  as long as some sort of postal/delivery/freight system exists. 
In a total no electricity no Internet no government  left zombie apocalypse collapse,  precious metals,  guns and food will be most valuable.

They would then fund terrorist acts, scare you, and people would then donate money to "defend their freedom" willingly.
Oh wait, that's already happening...
*   FBI Breaks Up Another Of Its Own 'ISIS' Plots, Where It Supplied Most Of The Planning
*   How Washington Funded the Taliban
*  C.I.A. Cash Ended Up in Coffers of Al Qaeda 
*  35 countries where the U.S. has supported fascists, drug lords and terrorists
Hmm so I guess nothing would change, we'd just keep our doors shut then and tell these warmongers to fuck off. At least with bitcoin they wouldn't be able to take money to fund terrorism without our consent.

Even if a real person used their own credit card from their own house with total intent, they can still do a chargeback. They'll just say it was their child that did it. Or they forgot what it was and don't want it anymore or they were drunk, or tired or didn't know what they were buying, or don't really want it anymore.  Or any other retarded reason. And the credit card company will comply. 
I run an online business and people do this shit all the time. I've fought the chargebacks for the first few hundred of them, but after that you just refund because it's completely pointless. "Oh customer can't print out the receipt? Chargeback." "Oh customer has trouble opening your product? Chargeback." "Oh customer forgot that they bought it and don't really want it anymore? Chargeback."
That's why I never understood how companies can exist that allow you to buy btc with credit cards. Chargebacks cannot be prevented even if you have the persons fingerprints and iris scan and a video camera shoved up their ass monitoring that it is really them using their credit card. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 17:40:21
Of course they wouldn't want to do anything bad. 
But what about a rogue employee? Which already happened when someone tried double spends.
What about hackers?
What about governments? Under whatever save the children bullshit they can take control over the pool and make the owners sign gag orders. 
They can halt transactions. In a global economy, halting transactions even for a few hours could spell doom for Bitcoin. Don't think Amazon or Google or any other multinational corporations would like to have their commerce halted, so they would never trust Bitcoin again.

The whole point is not to beat western union and their physical locations but make them irrelevant. When bitcoin grows, you wont need all those locations to exchange into local currency because with bitcoin you won't have to. 
You send 0.1 btc to cousin in China, he receives money on his phone. He goes and spends it instantly at a store that also accepts btc. In this scenario, western union becomes completely useless.
Its like Netflix making blockbuster irrelevant.

It also can't drop in value, if more people use it, it will go up in value since there's a limited amount of them in existence. There won't be enough for everyone, so theyll have to buy fractions, then fractions of fractions, and this will increase the price.

And then if this $100 could be deposited right into their bank if they enter their bank details in Skype. Or be able to be withdrawn at a local ATM with a secret access code.

If the internet isn't important, then why do all the governments of the world want to influence the interenet/social media so much?
 Operation Earnest Voice is a planned astroturfing campaign by the US government. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking sites based outside of the US. According to the United States Military Central Command (CENTCOM), the US-based Facebook and Twitter networks are not targeted by the program because US laws prohibit US state agencies from spreading propaganda among US citizens as according to the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012. However, Isaac R. Porche, a researcher at the RAND corporation, claims it would not be easy to exclude US audiences when dealing with internet communications.

I think the only way another crypto overtakes bitcoin is if one of bitcoins flaws is exploited, and another crypto exists without said flaw. People will flock there.
For example, if a 51% attack happens, and the proof of stake coins fixed their nothing at stake problem, people might flock to pos coins.

Why exchange currencies at all? 
Go to China. Shopkeepers have price in Yuan. You want to buy a trinket for 100 yuan .In your btc wallet you enter 100 yuan and press send. It sends them equivalent in btc. 
Go to Australia. Buy something for 50 aud, in btc wallet, enter 50 aud, it sends equivalent in bitcoin.
Shopkeepers can then instantly convert received btc to local currency on their end with things like local bitpay companies or keep the money in btc.

Biden and co are the ones that started this in the first place because they wanted to kick out a pro putin president and put in a pro western one. That's kinda what the US does all the time. Incite coups, start revolutions, topple or assassinate leaders just so they can put in people who will do their bidding.
* Months before any protests even started: Sept 2013: The future of Ukraine, a country of 48m people, and of Europe was being decided in real time. The participants included **Bill and Hillary Clinton, former CIA head General David Petraeus, former U.S. Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers**, former World Bank head Robert Zoellick, Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, Former U.S. energy secretary Bill Richardson was there to talk about the shale-gas revolution** 
* Then right as the protests started: One of the politicians of the Party of Regions Oleg Tsarev worked with activists who disguised themselves as IT specialists and got inside information on a secret project run by the US embassy in Kiev called "TechCamp" to begin a civil war in Ukraine. This project trains specialists in information warfare and the discrediting of state institutions using modern media. It is also used to help organize protests to topple the government. This project is **run by the US ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt**. The project organizers even showed examples how they ran the same campaigns in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. He says the training happened right in the embassy of the US. What country allows an "NGO" to operate right out of an embassy? Here's info about this from US government themselves:  : More than 60 civil society leaders from throughout Ukraine came together to get hands-on training in a variety of areas ranging from fundraising using crowdsourcing, citizen journalism, PR tools for NGOs,
* Hromadske.tv a new TV channel created for propaganda purposes, one of the only ones showing live feeds of the slaughter on Maidan, which helped immensly with the Maidans goals, **received huge grants from Embassy of the USA** and embassy of Netherlands, and the International Renaissance Fund (an organization funded by George Soros):  
* And then when the shit started, we have **McCain and Senator Chris Murphy** getting all friendly with a bunch of radical neo nazis: Far-right group at heart of Ukraine protests meet US senator John McCain  
*  U.S. **Vice President Biden** shakes hands with Oleh Tyahnybok, head of the All-Ukrainian Union Svoboda, as he attends meeting with deputies of the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev
* Welcome to Nulandistan: Propaganda and the Crisis in Ukraine:  . Nuland planning the future of Ukraine out:   and 
* And would you look at that: **Sponsors behind the new Ukrainian government:  (US State department, NATO, Horizon Capital, National Endowment for Democracy,** etc)

Your friends on the ground can't see the full picture though. Obviously in any country in the world when a big protest starts, there will be people who genuinely come to it to protest against the current president. 
Russia didn't start this conflict. There already was a pro Russian president, Russia had absolutely no need to cause chaos in Ukraine. It was the US who wanted to pull Ukraine towards them who started it. Once the US started this, Russia simply reacted.

Yep. Conventional wars cost too much, give bad publicity when your soldiers are dying and are dangerous if they get out of hand.
What the U.S. Does now are proxy wars and the funding of internal conflicts so that a country tears itself apart from the inside.
Look at Libya, Syria and Ukraine, the U.S. didn't use any conventional means to engage those countries, they simply funded opposition groups who started riots then took down the ruling regime and plunged the country into civil war.
Have you seen the recent news of Putin closing down foreign NGOs in Russia? It's not because he's the next Hitler, it's because that's how the west funds these revolutions, by funneling money to radicals and opposition groups through these NGOs, main goals to destabilize the country from the inside.
This way the USA looks like a good guy since they're "promoting democracy" and the government in power looks like the bad guy when they try to stop these demonstrations/riots.

There is a huge flaw in PoS.
Look at all the centralized services bitcoiners use. Exchanges, wallets, mixers, etc.
Imagine if PoS coiners also deposit their coins in these centralized places. One central service could hold a huge amount of coins. If they decide to collude with another, they could 51% and totally destroy the coin.
With bitcoin miners would have to collude to destroy the coin, with PoS the centralized entities where people store coins would have to collude. So I don't think it's a good fix.

In 10 years, you're a 15 year old who now needs to get paid for his part time job, or even send money to friends to split a meal.
Do you:
1. Go to a bank, bring your passport, social security number, parents, other bills, sign a ton of documents, agree to monthly fees, transaction fees. Hook this bank account up to some online service like paypal that takes a few days. Wait for those cent deposits to verify the account. Abide by their rules.
2. Download an app (or maybe you already had this app since you were 9 to which your parents deposited your allowance) and start instantly sending/receiving money to anyone anywhere without rules or expensive fees.

Local bitcoins is still on the market.
Off market is buying direct from miners, long term holders or whales.
If you sold me 20,000 bitcoins and I wired money to your bank, that's off market. It didn't affect the price in any way since it didn't touch any public exchanges.
I then do a 50x short, dump 5000 of those coins on various exchanges and profit handsomely.
Won't even need to buy off market anymore as the money made with a short of that size would make you back all the money you dumped and more.

So if I buy 10k off a miner... will that in any way affect the price? No.
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:52:55


We have no idea what kinds of changes are happening behind the scenes.
If a big miner has been selling off thousands of bitcoins off market for years, that cannot affect the public market price. It will only affect the price if he starts selling them on the market. 
If someone slowly amassed 100k coins and now wants to manipulate the market down to make money short selling... that's manipulation.
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:18:08
If a whale has a contract to buy X amount of coins over X months with a miner, that won't affect the price, since they can just state "I will keep buying all your mined coins at 3% over market price"
Then the whale can just keep dumping coins on exchanges to lower price, making money off shorts, and buying cheap coins off market from the miner. 
There are a million things they can do.

Your theory works if EVERY miner sold ALL the coins they mined.
Then we'd have a supply. But we have no idea who sells, who holds, or who does fuck else with their coins they mine.
And like I said, it doesn't have to be miners. Fat pocketed traders who do shorts/longs, whales,  can all add to this.

@_date: 2015-02-19 23:39:13
Can't you just then not use Stripe for that? Just take bitcoin direct.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:07:37
Its also like a unicorn because unicorns are cool and so is bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:28:15
Your mom is not the target demographic of this.
Investors and speculators are.
If a lot of them buy this, it will raise bitcoins price.
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:10:08
Lying and scamming? They're following government procedures.
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:00:36
They're down now. Probably all that extra traffic. Cant send in my docs to get verified
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:16:50
Their welcome. I agree.
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:01:39
Canada :(
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:33:02
Or HSBC helping launder money for terrorists and narco barons. Had to pay just 10% of one years profits. No jail time.
@_date: 2015-03-01 23:57:41
And you don't own your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:05:55
Its because banks already went through this approval process.

And ive had every single one of those things happen to me and everyone I know.
Monthly fees, yes, transaction fees, fuck yes, especially sending money internationally . Paypal holding my money for 6 months because they are fuckheads, yes. My bank not letting me send money to grandparents overseas, yes.
Let me add to the list:
Them able to cut an entire country out of international trade at the flick of a button. SWIFT. Which could happen to Russia any day. 
People in third world countries not able to participate in international trade because they dont have access to banks or credit cards.
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:02:51
That's because nobody has encroached on their turf yet. As these guys grow and start taking market share from wu they'll start to panic.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:21:47
They wouldn't tweet something they dont agree with, so this is an endorsement.

@_date: 2015-02-03 18:51:36
Why are you so angry? They're bringing free publicity to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:38:06
Or if he was HSBC bank.

@_date: 2015-02-27 22:24:53
Those companies show all that info so you'd trust them. With bitcoin you dont have to trust it since its open source and secured with math.
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:24:18
Dontcha know that only large banks like HSBC are allowed to launder money and work with human traffickers, narco barons and terrorists?
@_date: 2015-02-27 04:43:50
It's not organic  growth, just a short squeeze. So price could come down in a few hrs.
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:07:12


Bitcoin could be the backend connector of all the worlds gateways/banks/money transmitters/etc.
You can pay to anyone's paypal/bank/credit union/alipay/etc account from any other account without using any of those services...

PR man, PR.
This is how you should have replied
"Thank you kind sir for your criticism, but blah blah why your assumption is incorrect"
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:43:24
Yes that's why I mentioned the west. The developing world doesn't have access to any of this.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:13:13
Every thing you described is exactly why the current garbage financial system needs to go and why bitcoin is so much better. Only problem like you said is the price volatility. Buy a couple hundred bucks worth and hold.
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:48:17
Hahaha. How did you find this old thread.
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:29:07
Buy 10k off market.
Short with 9k.
Sell 1k on market.
Price is now low,  they made a huge profit.
Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:07:18
Bitstamp and btce are available to the whole world. Coinbase exchange is only available to a dozen US states and already has larger volume.... Moon time
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:38:17
In Canada all of the big banks charge monthly fees. 
Your receiving fees are $5-15. Have you ever tried sending Intl wire transfers? Its about $50+
I was simply selling products. After switching to a merchant account I never had problems with money being held up.
Western union also costs a shitload more than bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:09:50
Wow this guy is really, really really really really into Bitcoin. Just can't get enough of them. Makes sense, since there's a finite supply.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:12:44
This is some ripoff shitty noname exchange.
Not related to Cavirtex.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:25:41
These shitcoins only exist to move money away from complete utter idiots into smarter peoples hands.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:21:23
What about all that "real"currency they print out of thin air?
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:58:45
Its because there was a huginormous marketing campaign from a well known brand and the phone was better than everything on the market. Bitcoin in the west isn't really that amazing for the average Joe yet, they dont see its benefits.
If Facebook and google embraced bitcoin and allowed you to send money instantly to all your friends, family and businesses by messaging or just sending an email, that would be moon.
But currently bitcoin is still in early development stages.

Wow someone is massively downvoting everything in this thread.
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:22:28
It's hilarious because these are the same exact people that will bitch and moan and cry if bitcoin goes to the moon about "the rich getting richer" and how "if only I knew about it then". There's a reason why some VCS, visionaries and investors get richer, because they can see things the masses can't.

The choice is using bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:24:09
Isn't there that one that invested in coinbase? USAA or something. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:01:05
Yeah but they dont have to drop bitcoin. Having a btc button doesn't cause undue hardship on anyone.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:06:21
And someone has a trigger at 100, someone at 150, someone at 200, and therefore we have today's price. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:34:04
looool. How the fuck are you upvoted?
Coinbase also exists in the same world and has to abide by the same regulations as those cards. Bitcoin doesn't. The reason for the invasive bullshit on coinbase is precisely why Bitcoin is better. Once you are in Bitcoin none of those things apply to you.
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:29:04
I like how "they predicted it and it hasn't happened yet" = their predictions are bullshit and they're quacks.
