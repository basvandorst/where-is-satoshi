But you didn't do the "Im Mike from VoS how can I help?" Thingy you do where the doges live...
They are also very active, open and super helpful if you have issues. =)

So if Bitcoin moved to PoS in defence, you'd totally be cool with the devs taking the best answer for them?
@_date: 2014-09-01 21:02:28
It was two big donations actually. One of their expanded devs matched :)
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:31:08
This can also do it too, but not sure how many use it.

Whatever you say dear, and no it was mostly given you are trolling without cause on a subreddit without need. However carry on it is your right.

Should also note that it is a very secure, and safe means of transactions for cryptos. That you work with banking regulations, laws, and stuff not *against* them.

Sad thing is he, has done more for the overall crypto/digital currency world than you or most people ever will. I defend those that actually are productive even if people do not like what they have to say all the time. =)
If you care to bite at me, take it to home turf don't bring it here.

No, see what happened was I was exploring, and I saw Mike from VoS, you know Mike, he's pretty cool dude. Then I got lost and found and well he's safe, I know him. So we were just on our way back home...I swear it...
*This seems legitimate enough right?*

Not hijacked, just an impersonator account around. There have been a few thus far. At least the fake one has removed all the things that made it look exactly like the real one.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:29:52
This please, with the stipulation that must post his on there too.

1. No, most of it is online and usually done via computers. It can be done however via smartphones as well. Apple didn't not support bitcoin, it just didn't want the applications used for transferring bitcoin on their marketplace.
2. Yes, anyone can without question. There are even companies that exist now to help anyone do it. No it does not devalue bitcoin in the least. Given that most tend to directly gain their first market valuation against BTC, there is no real harm to bitcoin by their existence. Some of the side altcoins/cryptocurrencies can however draw people into Bitcoin a bit.
3. No bitcoin is not illegal in Canada. The Royal Canadian Mint in fact had/has it's own cryptocurrency in trials. MintChip. One of the few fully legal, and transparent cryptocurrency exchanges functions in Canada as well. (Vault of Satoshi)
Hope it helps and maybe answers some questions. As well $0.50  This isn't much but it is still some =)

name grabbed an existing "DogeCoinDark" project. So we cannot directly go blaming us for their existence. Lazy, shady, and opportunistic developer that he is name grabbed and hype rode.


Verge rebrand came around when their darkmarket was found to be **truly** disgusting. This coupled with their inability to actually maintain and hold to any of the promises of their roadmap which causes massive issues with their userbase was not helped when someone hard attacked their network multiple times. Ergo, rebrand and they have done a fairly good job of erasing most of their history. Enough that Subway and Pornhub jumped onto them being clueless to their history. 


Not our doing, nor our project. In fact it is the one thing in the space since the creation of their market we have refused to help in any form or way.

We are birthed of the LTC branch..


You are aware that Dogecoin follows BTC's upstream since our 1.7 release? Perhaps, I hope? We have more codebase in common with them already than we do LTC.


You do not have a large active community. You are a member who posts on reddit. When you start actively contribution towards the project, we can have a talk.
I am sort of saddened that I got sent this post, with the question of who you are and why are you posting this sort of thing over here and attempting to speak in any form for the Dogecoin project. Also, very sorry to the mods here that one of our..puppies escaped.
Promise, this one; out all on their own.

I am curious about this given there are three core developers for Dogecoin.
Which one of these are you claiming is getting ready a new coin?
Ross spoke below about his thoughts and his stance. Speaking to the other two amounts to the same. But given we do have more developers outside of the core devs, I got curious and I did poke around. 
Currently I am contact with 74/101 developers that call themselves or relate to Dogecoin development. Thus far there is not a single one in that stack that is even imagining launching a new coin. 
If you want to make it a bit shorter, care to share which it would be? Given you apparently know something that everyone is clueless about.

I would be interested, if you are still looking for beta readers.
