I agree that he should be asked in a more professional manner but in this case it's absolutely the right thing to question his "authority" and challenge his credibility. It's not OK to let people listen and spread the ideas of someone who does not even seem to want to grasp what he's talking about. Why should Krugman be in the position of a thought-leader? For most of his life he's been bankrolled by the very parties who have every reason to act against bitcoin. Obviously there's a natural conflict of interest here. Don't fall into [the credentialist trap](

reasonably easy. Sofort is the best if you qualify, although initial payments are only up to 50 and then you have to wait at least 3 working (bank) days until they raise it. blockchain.info on the other hand accepts up to €500 with sofort straight, but i still dont see my coins 24+ hours later...
