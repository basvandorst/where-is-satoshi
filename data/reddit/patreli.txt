Halvening less than a year away, but if you feel like you have reached your goals then sell. Don’t listen to these angry hodlers.
If I had the chance to sell at $20k and buy back at $4k I would’ve. Just trust your gut and hope you have the right entry/exit strategy.
Good luck

Its use case is mostly a speculation tool and store of value, much like gold... its practical use isn‘t what defines its intrinsic value. Its scarcity and transferability via a dynamic protocol are.
Hence, being unavailable to Americans citizens due to laws will make it more scarce and difficult to obtain.


I think you need to read up the definition of FUD, 
“FUD is a *technique* used by larger companies who have a large market share.”
Hence, FUD means: lies which constitutes market manipulation. Thanks for going around in circles due to your superior understanding.


I don’t know which is more pathetic your investment (gambling) strategy, or your arguing skills.
Going through your post history, just clarified what type of mindset you have.
Like I said before, outlawing bitcoin in one country will only affect citizens of that jurisdiction, not the permanent evolvement of btc price. (Asia still has the most market share).

Insulting someone’s intelligence doesn’t strengthen your argument.
The inception of dark net markets make both scenarios negligible. 
Get with the times, 2018 anything is obtainable with the right resources. The days of back alleys and fiat have been old-fashioned since silk road albeit less mainstream.
Indeed, it did get more expensive, once it was established that the news was FUD. Bitcoin cannot be banned, It was all just market manipulation especially china at the end of 2016.
and there is a big wide world beyond USA that cares not for your legislations. It will be business as usual for the rest of us. Take that uncle sam!
Thanks to my ‘stupidity’ and investing in BTC when I did, I’m very much amused by your retorts.
Even more amused when I scroll through your posts and see you making threads complaining about 0.001 btc transaction fees. Cute.

The most profitable stock traders are successful psychopaths, completely emotionally detached from it all.

Can’t you go to the police with this information and get a crime reference number, since this person technically stolen from you,
To perhaps clear your own name?

Usually a transaction comes with a reference message? Surely that will help narrow things down.
Best of luck getting this resolved, the thief doesn’t deserve to get away without consequence.
I believe a CRN will clear you of the fraud accusation from your bank, but not on their policy regarding bitcoin.

God I love how people fail to exercise any form of comprehension skills.
I said while browsing the pirate bay NOT online banking or emailing grandma... it’s also illegal to download copyright content, hence why piratebay is blocked by several ISP’s.
