There is cash in them you know. Probably not enough to warrant this level of effort but still.

Thanks! Luckily no one has fallen for it yet 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:59:53
Well it is an ATM...

To quickly see if the address they are using to pay you from comes from an illicit source of funds, you can check the free service 
Blockchain Intelligence Group created it!

I think they have a software tool you have to inquire about
