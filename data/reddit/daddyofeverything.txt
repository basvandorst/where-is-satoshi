This is much better than the "get better income" or "you have psychological magic money issue" comments I've been seeing. Fucking cancerous redditors. I appreciate the advice, this is pretty much exactly what I was hoping someone would advise me with.
Unsure why people think I'm financially insecure. 80k a year isn't bad for a couple married a year and a half, something I stated in the comments before I removed the bloody post. It's not the small amounts, it's the "even if I put 5k in right now I'll be nowhere near 1 full bitcoin. Any tips or advice? Should I invest bigger, smaller, and if so where else?"
Hearing Bitcoin as high risk puts this into perspective for me, and for that I'm very thankful to you for being the only sane one giving advice. Thanks! :)

*waves wand*, ok, done. Thanks for the advice.

"Get more money."
"You'd be better off investing in ____ and ____ until you can invest more."
Thanks, I'll be sure to take your practical fucking advice and make more money. :D

The purists here really get on my fucking nerves.
I put $125 at no risk to try and get an ROI for my wife and soon to be family. Sure it's not much but I'll put it what I can, when I can, when it won't hurt us, along with Simple IRA matching at both our full time jobs. Whatever helps us plan for kids and retirement.
Hope the tech grows, and as a web developer it's fascinating, but don't be narcissistic about your intentions surrounding anycoin.

Thank you for the advice. I have only ever invested what I'm willing to lose. I'm not jealous, I'm simply wondering if such small investments are better spent elsewhere (reserving large investments or bonuses for Bitcoin).

So a $7.5k raise in 2 years isn't changing anything while I look into investing as a beginner, coming here for advice only to be met with this for "advice"? Go fuck yourself.

We're just shy of $80k combined with generous raises every review, so income isn't the issue. Wife's college loans and a few payments are a roadblock for investing but not a major problem.
Again, we could afford to lose $300 a month buying the dips. Still, that's 3-5 years of investing at it's current price ...

Did I say it was too hard? No. I was looking for a "keep doing what you're doing" or "until you can invest more at a time you're best bet is to go 401 or Simple IRA". How is that so hard? Instead I was met with the most immature advice possible. Way to misread and be rude.

When I get into something I like knowing as much as I can. Separates me from the people I know who invested hard at 20k, saw immediate losses, and backed out. Sad.

This. They're"purists". It's fucking weird man.

I have no idea what you just said, but I want to. Resources?

FUCK that argument. People like you say "oh, I've got nothing bad in my email, it's ok". I ask those people "great, so you'll give me your email and password? Nothing to hide, right?" Yet they still don't give me access.
Privacy does NOT mean you are doing something shady.

"I'm down ___k" lol complaining during a massive dip ... It was 15k last week. I'm down by a large amount too, but don't give a fuck. Stop crying and buy the dips! This is the opportunity I've been waiting for.

You must be the creator of *"My Butthole Hurts"* coin.
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:58:43
**$8914.99** as of right now ... when it hits 9000 again I'll be wondering about you.

I never wanted that meme to die, so good
