Agdeed Coinbase fucked up
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:48:38
Agreed. I'm in for the long run so doesn't really matter. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:42:10
Haha, they may be hoping for the same still :). Let's see what happens. Just gonna watch the storm blow over. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:55:29
Hahaha. Christ what is going on here

As a new bitcoin owner, I'm trying to reverse a dip by making random claims.
Cool. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:27:44
Lol. You don't even know what XRB is...
It's different to XRP. Pipe down :) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:48:05
Yep but it must be more than that. My other holdings such as XRB have plummeted despite having no wait times and no fees. So there must be something kicking off.

You're not far off. But also the media makes it that you will be a millionaire tomorrow if you invest. Unfortunately idiots believe this.
Just have a diversified portfolio and youll be fine 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:28:56
You are 100% correct. What we are now trading is not a currency, we are trading a social phenomena. We are merely riding a wave...
My HOPE and the reason I've constructed my portfolio the way it is, is that if BTC crashes, money will move to ETH or LTC. 
I am also tempted to buy 10 of every legitimate alt coin.
Once Coinbase goes public, as they have suggested they will, they will gain money by people buying currency. The more currencies they offer the more people will buy. The more people buy the value goes up. 
That can see something go from &lt;£0.10 a coin to $500 in a year.

It's actually genuine. I can't disclose anything else for obvious reasons as it was internal communications. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:50:52
I agree with this comment, or what I think you're getting at. A lot of the rise was new money, people who have no idea jumping in. I jumped in around then too, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:56:41
Bloody nora. It's Christmas eve, spare the riddles :) 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:41:02
Blockchain will start matching your repetitive comments off as completed transactions soon...
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:52:08
Good theory. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:49:23
Selling for Xmas, buy back on 26th, happy new year. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:14:25
XRB. Seems to solve this. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:31:36
Ah. Just disregard anything that doesn't support a rally. Fair enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:42:10
XRB Raiblocks. All of it. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:53:31
Suspect it means applied to. The whole image? 
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:12:45
It seems like there's a tonne of programs being used. I have very little knowledge of these games, but stenography is definitely a key part.

If you had registered on the website, how close are you to solving the 0.31btc part, and how close to the 310btc? A little clue would be nice to motivate people to look for the 0.31 as I think most have given up but it's still a decent amount! 
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:40:33
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:14:28
Please share the solution, for my sanity.

Imagine being such a pleb you beg for BTC on this thread �� 
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:35:01
You're close. You might have to add -Md5 depending on openssl version 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:53:00
To the moon.

I think the main issue is that the market sees a LOT of competition to Bitcoin. And many of them are contenders. LN is good, don't get me wrong, but there are coins out there that are fast, no fee, scalable... just like LN. So Bitcoin is now trying to play catch-up!
