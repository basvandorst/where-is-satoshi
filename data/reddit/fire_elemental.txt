This is actually a fallacy. It is irregular regulation that stifles innovation. This was one of the key problems with nuclear energy in the U.S., and was a contributing factor in the stifling and eventual downfall of nuclear energy development(along with environmental concerns and a plateauing energy consumption rate). 
For more on this you can read "The Atomic Energy Commission Under Nixon" by Seaborg and Loeb and "Reflections on Big Science" by Weinberg.

Problems with your statement:
1. The USPS has been in the red for years:
2. The only person offering any real innovation in trains since maglev stated that he didn't want to follow through on his idea because he wanted to focus on ***spaceflight***. And even after saying that it looks like they are still building test facilities:
So right there I already don't know what fucking planet you are on. But lets move on to the errors in basic verbal reasoning:
So a variable changes, and a constant doesn't. If a constant is set to zero, it is still a constant, not a variable. Why? Because an integer only has one value, ever. It's the law of identity. If an industry isn't regulated at all, over a fairly long period of time, that means that the rate of regulation change over time is approaching the value of zero. Virtually constant, not a large delta. So no regulation and no change in that would certainly be a case of regularity in regulation.
So by saying irregular regulation stifles innovation (and lets be honest, business in general, business needs some amount of trust and stability in the future or investment doesn't happen) I have left ample room for cases of zero regulation, with virtually zero change in that regulation. Your counter point is not that at all. In fact it makes it seem like you haven't really thought things through before you started typing.
If you want to just express the opinion that all regulation is bad, government is bad, and I'm bad for disagreeing with you, (which I haven't actually, I'm just pointing out that, historically, the original comment was not the fact of the matter), then just do it! It's ok to have an opinion! When you try and make your opinion look to be something more then it is, like an objective reality for instance, you make yourself look silly. You don't need to do that man, just have an opinion, it's fine!

The response is simple:
"Dear (insert bank name),
It has come to my attention with your latest questionnaire, and your attempts to force me into responding to it that you have forgotten the type of relationship we have. I will take a quick moment to remind you. The relationship we have is one of business and customer. This relationship is one which is mutually voluntary, i.e. one which can be canceled at any time by either party. This quality of being mutually voluntary is a necessary condition of this relationship. 
By forgetting the nature of our business relationship, and instead trying to impose a relationship of ruler and subject with the use of threats (which are likely based on a firm foundation of bullshit), you have broken the fundamental basis of our business relationship which, despite your best effort, is still mutually voluntary. I am terminating this relationship immediately, I will never again be a customer of yours, and I will warn away all other would be customers of your predatory and dictatorial business.
I wish you all the luck that comes from such practices.
Your former customer,
(person who you are)"

1. USD are the fiat currency of a financial system based in inflation and public debt.
2. She is being cheated by her masters every time she uses USD.
3. USD is also used to enforce dominance throughout the world with petro-dollars, making everyone in the world a victim of the power hegemony that finds its foundation in USD.
4. BTC breaks this monopoly. It does this by being technologically superior to the USD. Thus, it breaks up many monopolies that are built around people that need to move money around for various every day, non-criminal reasons, not just the Federal reserve's shenanigans.
5. Ergo, by abandoning USD, you are liberating yourself from a part of the slavery and exploitation of the power elite and encouraging others to do the same.
6. Finally, BTC is not only the desirable option for reasons of personal liberty, but also for reasons of withdrawing support from a financial system that is universally parasitic and exploitative toward all people. To a truly ethical person, the choice *should* be easy.

And as I said, regardless of what YOU think the VALUE is, it IS being traded at a PRICE that is comparable with bitcoins for the units traded, ounce:BTC. 
The problem here is that you think that your estimation of value for silver is more correct per ounce of silver then the publicly traded price per ounce, and either don't know or refuse to realize that your opinions on value, whether or not they are right, have nothing to do with the publicly traded price, unless you are about to buy many many tons of silver at a price that matches the value you assign. Which, if you had the money, I'm sure there would be a lot of people willing to sell their silver to you, whilst smirking at your foolishness and damning you for a fool.
So, to clarify, I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying whether or not you are right doesn't matter. We aren't talking value, we're talking price here in this thread. Price is a matter of fact, value is in the eye of the beholder.
