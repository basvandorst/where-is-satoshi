I just sold all my assets. This is huge! Nobody knows whats going to happen. I kept NEO and XRP. Those two comply with regulations and the Central Bank of China visited Ripple last week.

Yes I agree, but the Dollar is not a Crypto. If you have Dollars you can buy gold now. In the Crypto context, Ripple XRP has always worked with regulators, helping the banking system. Maybe it will deep after this news, but in the long term I see it as clear winner. The ones whom just banned ICOs was at Ripple headquarter for one week ago.

I do as well. I do not see XRP goes up to 4000$ in the near future but at current price it still very cheap. 1$ will be really big milestone for XRP and thereafter we wait and see. Today Ripple launched its office in India to target the Indian market. The company is doing their best, lets hope for the best. BTC and XRP can live together. In my opinion BTC is store of value, the digital gold. XRP is bridge currency for fast settlements and cross border payments. 
Now I sold my bitcoin to buy cheaper again. I followed Goldman Sachs chef analyst Sheba Jafari on her analysis regarding Bitcoin and she was right. Now she predicted again that bitcoin will go down to 2200$. As they said: "Nobody knows except Goldman Sachs".

Yes sure. They work close to central banks, thus, they have clear advantage over the rest of Cryptos.

In my opinion, Neo is good one they have already worked with regulators. But I think they will retrace more. Before the rally that toke it up to 50$, it was at 7$. I will wait for it at this price level. XRP, Ripple is important because the Chinese central bank was at their headquarter last week to discuss Blockchain technology. In my opinion XRP will be a clear winner at the end. But it is not an advice for investments. Please do your own research.

I dont see the differnence... 50% of Bitcoin is hold by China, more than 20% by US. Btw 100% XRP is premined. My idea is XRP has a use case at least, cross border payments and they are working on it. XRP is like a stock en a company. They had meeting with Central bank of china last week, so in my opinion they are doing very well. And if you want us to deeping and Scam, Fiat currency is the biggest Scam/Ponzi scheam ever.

XRP is distributed, different actors runs validators around the globe. Of course Ripple labs in San Fransisco mantain the RippleNet. The banks will create their own Crypto, they are working on it. So XRP will never be a global currency or banks currency. It serves as a bridge currency, for value transfer. Not just banks can use it, but payment providers as well, for example money gram, western union... XRP can help countries/people to transfer money/value cheap and fast. The cost is less than 0.01$ and it takes 4 seconds to settle. Is different from the other cryptos, but if I want to invest in a startup "stock"  I will choose XRP among them. Please this is my point of view, maybe I am wrong, do your own research to confirm what I said.

In my opinion different Cryptos has different purposes. Yes, right now everything seems threatened, but after the storm has passed we will see clear winners, the ready established coins, compliant with authorities and have defined use case.

The key as always is diversification. They are Cryptos that worked with regulators from day one. We like it or not, this  move was foreseeable. I will of course add to my position in those safe ones.
