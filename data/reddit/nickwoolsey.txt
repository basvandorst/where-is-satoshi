I share your pessimism.

I wouldn't worry yet. People have been complaining that it takes weeks to get money off of QuadrigaCX. I imagine it's partly because of our super-regulated banking system... which is also the reason we didn't get demolished by the mortgage crisis ten years ago, so I figure it's a fair trade off ;)

It is indeed a dream! Why do you think it's so far fetched? We know that Starbucks is involved, somehow. I don't see how they'll make big money selling coffee for Bitcoin. I can see how they'd make big money selling bitcoin, and it would be just as easy for them to set-up. 
Who else is in a better position to sell crypto over a retail counter? I think it's a slightly-possible dream, but I wouldn't place a bet on it ;)

(Edited for clarity) For thousands of years, the only way currency worked was when governments backed them with authority. For instance, cash is just pieces of paper, but we trust it because we know that our governments invest a lot of resources into anti-counterfeiting efforts. That requires multiple branches of the government working together, including police, the FBI, courts, and prisons. All that effort means that we can take $50 from some dude we don't know, feeling pretty safe that it's real money.
Two thousand years ago, the same was true with Roman coins. The Roman government would decree, "these coins are worth such-and-such... and if you fuck with them, we'll cut your head off." That gave the Roman empire standard units of exchange, which helped it to prosper for hundreds of years.
Then, in 2008, along came Bitcoin. If you send 0.1 Bitcoin to my wallet, I don't have to worry about whether it's counterfeit or not. It's mathematically impossible to send fake Bitcoin to my Bitcoin address. No authority required. 
To qualify that: Every hacker in the world can look up which address on the Bitcoin Blockchain belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, who created Bitcoin and disappeared. All those Bitcoins are sitting on that address, over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoins... but nobody has figured out how to hack it.
Thus Bitcoin is bringing something new to the global financial table. It solves problems that no bank or government before figured out how to solve.
...but invest in it? Be careful! There are now 2000 other blockchain cryptocurrencies all claiming to be better than Bitcoin. There's a chance that some of them will take over and Bitcoin will eventually be relegated to the history books. Nobody knows.
I hope that helps!

Buying coffee with crypto would be awesome. It's also possible that Starbucks is considering selling crypto, much the way newsstands and post offices have begun doing. This is my own speculation, based entirely on the fact that Binance published incredible profits during 2018, and I imagine many corporations noticed. 
"Can I get a tall latte, and $200 of Bitcoin please?" 
"Sure, just let me scan your wallet barcode... (beep). That will be $203.75. Have a great day!"

The first several statements are a quick overview of how difficulty works. If you know that already, skip to below the --- line
The difficulty resets every 2016 blocks (roughly every 2 weeks). 
The reset algorithm is designed to keep blocks happening roughly every 10 minutes. 
If hash rate has gone up by 5%, the difficulty will be set 5% higher to compensate, and visa-versa. 
For many miners, Bitcoin has fallen under the price that makes their operation profitable, assuming they sell Bitcoins as soon as they are mined. This is a variable because different miners pay different rates for electricity, rent, hardware, labour, etc. 
When price is below average profitability, some miners will start turning off their equipment if they deem the cost of electricity higher than their bitcoin earnings (it's complex because they may also keep operating, if they can afford it, with the believe that they will be able to sell the Bitcoins at a profit when price rises again). 
As miners turn off, the overall hash rate slows, and it will take longer to mine blocks. The next time the difficulty resets, the algorithm will adjust the difficulty downward accordingly. Those still mining will discover blocks more often.
Thus there is no critical line. If the price of Bitcoin dropped to $50, and stayed there for a long time, many miners would have to close shop. The drastic decrease in in hash rate would result in a drastic lowering of difficulty. The remaining miners would make many more bitcoins per day. 
The one serious threat via a massive price crash that I can think of: 
If Bitcoin fell drastically, to something like $50, that could result in a severe increase in mining concentration. As a mental experiment: If one large mining operation remained, and that miner had more than 50% of the hash rate, that would jeopardize confidence in the decentralization of the network.
So I call the drop-dead price, the price that results in one miner retaining over 50% of the hash rate of the network. 
Whew, had to think that one through!
If I'm wrong I look forward to the correction!

Some people know how to go back in time on [coinmarketcap.com]( to see how past bull runs played out. We can also go back on Reddit and see how people gloated about Bitcoin being dead in 2014. 
If Bitcoin goes to $50, and 90% of miners close shop, resulting is mass hysteria as one large miner is left with over 50% of the hash rate... if that happens, and you catch me saying everything is fine, you are welcome to accuse me of denial, because if that happens you'll be right! :)
...but for now, BTC is only at 1/5th it's ATL. That's pretty tame to some previous corrections.

Very possible. Also maybe he wasn't a single person. Maybe he was.... The CIA!

Starbucks has been underperforming, and I think the general sentiment is that they've saturated the market, and stocks/profits can't go higher unless they find new initiatives. 
I agree that the media coverage is risky, but we do know that they are somehow involved, so they are already taking a risk via association. Accepting bitcoin or selling bitcoin, I don't see why one is a reputation risk and the other not. Actually it would be strange for them to say, "We accept Bitcoin, but if you want to buy some, you have to give somebody else that 1.5% fee." 
Ok, I'll bet one dollar that Starbucks is selling crypto by 2021! :)

It's amazing that people can't seem to zoom back even two years to see the up tend. Although the next-ATH-is-higher pattern can't repeat forever, so eventually the Bears will be right. 
... But I don't think that's yet ��

Nobody knows what happened to Satoshi. It's a big mystery. I think he truly believed that the world needed a new kind of money, and that it needed to be somewhat decentralized. He was the head of Bitcoin, so he disappeared to cut off the head, so to speak. 
Satoshi's 980,000 Bitcoins are spread around several addresses. They are worth billions because 1 Bitcoin is currently worth around $4000. If Bitcoin goes back to $10 per Bitcoin, then those coins will only be worth 9.8-million dollars. If Bitcoin goes to $100,000, those coins will be worth 98-billion dollars.
The price of Bitcoin is determined through supply and demand, just like gold... but gold isn't likely to be replaced by a gold-alternative any time soon. It's also not going to replace the backbone of international banking. Thus the future of Bitcoin could go either way. 
Satoshi accumulated many Bitcoins because he was the first person mining, and he ran his mining rig for the first few years while things got up and running. Mining means you're running a node that creates the blockchain blocks. Every time you create the next block, you get a Bitcoin reward. There is a math-challenge involved, and whoever solves the math challenge first gets to make the block. The process is called mining. It's all pretty weird. 
If Satoshi never comes back, and nobody ever figures out how to hack Bitcoin, then yes those Bitcoins will sit on those addresses forever. 
So the moral of the story: If you buy Bitcoin, don't lose your private key! There is nobody in the whole world who can get your bitcoins back. ;)

I don't even know what Reddit gold is! :)

If you're sending it to somebody else's account also on coinbase, then possibly, because when your BTC is on coinbase, it's probably just a credit in a database, and they can credit it to another database without anything happening on the blockchain.
But if the BTC is actually going from one blockchain public address to another, it will still take time... But if both accounts are within Coinbase, then it wouldn't surprise me if they accepted the transfer as complete after just one Confirmation... Which would still take several minutes at least.
But for instant, you'll have to wait for the lightning network to mature. There is currently no way around the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain can only process 7 transactions per second.

For those who don't know what "liquidating shorts" means: On some exchanges users are able to short Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This means (at least in effect) they borrow the cryptocurrency and sell it, hoping to buy it back cheaper when the price goes down, to return it while keeping the profit from having sold it at a higher price. 
To further clarify, a theoretical short works like this: I borrow 1BTC. The seller thinks the price will go up, so they're happy. I immediately sell the BTC at $8000, thinking I'll be able to buy back at 7100. If that happens, I'll have made $900 minus the interest on the BTC loan. 
BUT, since I know that the price may go up rather than down, I put a stop-loss on the trade, which means I program my account to close the trade if BTC goes above a certain price, like perhaps $8150. If price hits that number, my account will BUY BACK that BTC. This means the most I will lose is $150 plus interest on the loan. 
Thus, dramatic price swings upward can partially be explained by a chain reaction of short-order stop-losses being triggered. 
If we apply this to the recent spike: While BTC was hovering around $8000, lots of trading TA commentators were saying that the price was going to go back to 7300, 6500, 4900 etc. There were a large number of short orders on exchanges that allow for them. 
In theory, most of those short orders had stop-losses, so as price went over a certain amount, a wave of stop losses got triggered, which set off buy orders, which sent the price higher, which set off more stop losses, which set off more buys, which sent the price even higher, etc. 
This chain reaction wiped out all the short orders with stop-losses, resulting in the $700 price spike we witnessed. 
I'm no expert, I just wanted to put forward a non-manipulation possibility and to explain stop-losses, since many people don't seem to know about them.

The halving effects how much BTC miners earn every time they create the next block. That's how BTC comes into existence. 
If you mean profit in terms of selling BTC for currencies like USD, then things get more complicated.
Every halving decreases the rate at which new BTC is coming into the market, so that can be a factor in price... But if demand for Bitcoin goes down, a decreased rate of new supply will not keep price from going down. 
Each halving will have less of an effect on the market. To understand why, imagine it's many years in the future. There are 20,843,000(ish) BTC on the market and halving takes the block reward from a fraction of one BTC to half that fraction. Will that effect the price? Probably not much, because it's just a trickle either way.
Over 17-million BTC has already been mined. For sure the next halving will have a non-negligible effect on price. But it will be only half as important as the last halving. We're a lot closer to that future scenario than we were a couple halvings ago.
I'm keen to hear any counter theories.

You're right, I was only talking near future. For distant future, Bitcoin price may eventually stabilize and prices will be quoted accordingly.
Lots of people don't think the point of crypto is to replace dollars. Crypto may work synergistically along with fiat currencies, to open up options that weren't available before. 
Crypto offers a new kind of rails for Internet payments. It also offers alternatives to traditional banks that can reach people who don't have access to banking. Crypto offers solutions for machine to machine transactions that fiat can't provide.
All of that can happen while Amazon still posts prices in fiat.
Crypto will replace fiat if it can offer a more efficient way to transfer value. I personally don't think crypto needs to replace or fight with fiat. Crypto will allow some things that fiat can't, like microtransactions.
Or it will force the banks to update their system to offer such things. 
Anyway, it sounds like you want to hear from a Bitcoin maximalist. That's not me so I'll just see what other people have to say.

The lightning network is rolling out slowly, but it's not the new normal yet. It's a network that works on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. 
In the past 1.5 years the Bitcoin network has rolled out other updates ( such as "segregated witness") that have improved network performance and lowered fees substantially.

Bitcoin interest can follow extreme price movements in either direction. The recent rise in Google trends for Bitcoin could partially be people wanting to see the fall, kind of like ambulance chasing.  Last time I checked, "Is Bitcoin dead?" Was one of the related searches.
Of course that could still lead to higher prices since word spreading about low prices might draw in people who thought they missed the boat. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:47:10
Lots of people don't know how short orders and stop-losses work. I don't think we can know 100% what caused the spike. I just wanted to explain short orders for those who don't know.

I expect we'll first see adoption via online merchants who have reason to prefer crypto over credit cards.
They will encourage their customers to pay with crypto by offering discounts or loyalty points.
It won't take off until some banks start offering on-the-fly exchange and payment.
The merchant will post prices in dollars. Customers will pay the going rate equivalent in crypto, either from their crypto wallets or on-the-fly as an alternative to credit cards.
The merchant meanwhile will choose whether they want to keep the crypto as crypto, or to swap to dollars instantly.
All of this will require crypto baking solutions at either end. Companies like OmiseGo are working on that kind of solution.
Just my speculations!

We know that a lot of companies successfully raised capital through ICOs. The article doesn't publish any details on who was contacted and about which products and services.
Thus it's very possible their criteria was, "contact companies that have used blockchain, but not including stuff that's actually been successful."
... Anyway, it's a bit like saying solid state batteries are just hype, because nobody's using them in cars yet.
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:47:11
I think so. I see people publish "x amount of shorts liquidated on such-and-such exchange" type posts, but I've never dug into the details.
The only thing I'm sure of, is that price movements happen through a variety of variables. I don't see why whales wouldn't try to affect price. But if they did, they would try to use their leverage to set off a price movement that the markets were primed for.
Cheers!
