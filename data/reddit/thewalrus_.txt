Oh, are you using a 5 year old smartphone?  What OS version is it running?

I don't understand how people don't understand Apple's *CURRENT* choice.  If it was a permanent and explicit quote from Cook saying "Apple will never add Bitcoin support" I'd be with you.  But all we have to go on is inferences based on their actions in the App Store.  Let's break this down.
Apple is currently more or less the most profitable company in the world.  Certainly the most profitable tech company.  They have *literally* the deepest pockets of any potential defendant.
Fully understanding that, how can anyone blame them for limiting their own *uncertainty* and **potential legal liability** in an international context?  Think about how much they spent on lawyers *before bitcoin was even known to the public.*  And think about the amount of money people could **still** potentially lose due to this technology.
Note the distinction from Google/ Android.  We're starting with the assumption that Apple uses DRM up the ass, and Android is basically the opposite:
* Because Apple has an enforceable commercial contract with every single app developer, this opens them up to potential liability to an unhappy end-user.  There is, arguably at least, a very close legal relationship between Apple's contract with App devs, and the customer's direct agreement with that App Dev.  They offer the Apps as a digital "retailer" and are worried they'll be liable if someone sues down the line for BTC losses, i.e. under a "Products Liability" lawsuit.
* That's extremely different from Android, where anyone can create anything and distribute it how they wish.  Google isn't associated with Android devs anymore than Windows is associated with Firefox.  Even though there are App stores on Android, they're not closely regulated by Google.  
*  Google and Apple both have legal teams who understand that the Android App Store(s) model limits Google's liability in a way that Apple's App Store, in its current form, cannot.
Knowing that these companies have these policies from the outset, and accepting these differences, noone should be complaining about Apple's perfectly rational decision to be cautious around BTC until a widespread need arises.  As I said at the outset, they have more to lose in terms of dollars in the bank, than anyone else.  Every person who relies on a potentially illegal iOS app is a potential lawsuit to Apple.  Bitcoin laws are quickly changing across the planet for better AND for worse.  
The only other rational decision at this point, imho, would be for Apple to scrap their current app store and go Open Source.  But noone honestly expects them to do so.  So what do you people reasonably expect?
