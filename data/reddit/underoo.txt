They are to an extent. When I was hired to work for a large insurance company, I had to sign release forms stating that they could contact my previous educators and get records. (I was 28 at the time) A few years went by and I resigned from the job, but on my exit I asked to review everything in my HR profile. "My" (They actually had some other persons records in there, not mine.. I didn't mention it, but they were from my school) and It certainly did have all of this persons information in it. Detention, tardies, etc. Not that any of it mattered obviously, but it was there.

Can someone remind me what information I had to send to Gox to get an account? I don't have any funds in gox, but I am a US resident and had a fully approved account... just a drivers license if I recall?

I'll re-listen and review later.

Why would you want something that doesn't integrate as well, doesn't sync, and doesn't have mobile apps?

And the right to what is being violated?

Excellent. We will put this in a sandbox tomorrow and see what it does.

You lack a sufficient knowledge of how LastPass works to comment on this.

This is kind of off topic and maybe a little ignorant... Once BTC is no longer economically feasible to mine given the difficulty rate, can these ASICs be used for something else productive? Or are they programmed in some certain way to work with mining programs?
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:43:12
Wow... OK. So as a tangent of my original question... What if I turned my current qt wallet into a paper wallet... there'd be no way to check the balance?
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:29:26
I think that's one of the reasons they freeze your stuff
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:18:44
Are they just going back and forth to manipulate the cost of BTC? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 13:32:31
They'll be interested, but keep in mind as a student, you probably don't have a lot of rights. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:16:56
I think they automatically HOLD the money. Don't they? Someone did this to me at one point, it came out of my account for a bit and then they dropped it, I got the money back. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:19:23
I haven't made any yet... Just asking in advance.
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:18:46
Are they a great target? Yes. 
Do you know anything about how encryption works? Or WHERE the encryption for LastPass happens? It all happens on the client. So all lastpass has is a gigantic blob of data that even they cannot decrypt. There is no voodoo in this, this is all science and math and can be proven as many times as you'd like. 
Blackberry enterprise Server is also just as secure... not being possible for anyone (governments, blackberry, isps, etc) to decrypt BES data because it is DONE RIGHT. This is why the Indian government forced blackberry to build backdoors and change technologies for them. 
The point is, it IS POSSIBLE to use unbreakable encryption... if you do it right... but it IS possible. LastPass has "done it right"

Fill me in here, Bitcoin is a technology. Are we talking about exchanges needing regulation / oversight?

Why the downvote? My response was in regards to "our parents are taking ALL the downside risk, but not much of the upside. "
My point was that I don't see the risk at all if they're getting FIAT dollars in the end.

I am not a scholar of the law so pardon my ignorant question.... 
Can they "Just do that" ? Meaning, apply laws to something like this? Could they apply the same rules/laws to pine cones? 
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:29:24
Wow. Amazed.

Hmm.. I can't remember if I sent them bank info or not... If I did... what should I do?
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:36:27
If you do your research I think it is beyond a reasonable doubt that LastPast is not in cahoots with the government. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:36:02
Sure. 
You are a bank. You have 10 customers. Each customer deposits 1,000 dollars. You have 10,000 dollars in your vault.
If you invest your 10,000 dollars in, lets say, bitcoin, (What banks and insurance companies actually gamble on is another story, some of it is long term loans, some is day traders, etc, each bank has their own team of smart people to do this) you've got 10,000 dollars in bitcoin. But then something bad happens and bitcoin goes to 0. Now you have zero dollars in your vault. 
3 customers come to the bank to withdraw 100 dollars each. With what money, do you give them what you owe them? If you were required to keep a certain percentage of your worth as a reserve, you wouldn't have this problem. 
If it were the 2008 crash, you could replace "bitcoin" with "really crappy home loans that people couldn't afford and everyone defaulted on" 
Make sense?

Pardon my extreme ignorance, I thought the difficulty part was based on how "far along" we are in the process... Is it based somehow on overall hashing power?

@_date: 2014-03-27 02:28:36
In a similar spirit; Can we "just" have bitcoin renamed to "othercoin" (or anything) and then the laws don't apply?
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:19:13
True, bit depends how they "bill" him. This is true if the rent is "1.2BTC" - can't you just agree that the rent is 700 dollars per month? (Or whatever)

That's interesting. Out of your list I have only ever used blockchain. Did any of these services suffer a spill of data?

15 years ago I was suspended for something similarly ridiculous under the same  "zero tolerance policy" - I went through the student handbooks that we were required to read so we knew all of "the rules" - Zero Tolerance Policy had been removed several years ago. My parents and I had a meeting and I brought up that I could not find this rule in the handbook and I would like an explanation. The explanation was given that "We don't go back on punishments" I heard the same thing from the school board when we talked to them. 
Perhaps our alleged student has an opportunity to spend his Monday out of school writing a report or white paper of his own explaining what Bitcoin is, who accepts it, etc. Don't forget that cash is used for drugs too, in your report. Just a thought. Show them that you're intelligent and that they're slaves to the local news channel. (Ok, maybe leave the slaves part out) 
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:53:00
But they're not bringing in cash like the article states... They're bringing in Bitcoin... perhaps they should also sell bitcoin... It's great that they're doing this, don't get me wrong, but what they are doing is bringing in 20-30k of unstable money.
