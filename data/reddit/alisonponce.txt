Hahaha no but it is pretty intense meeting someone you don’t know 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:50:19
Well you wouldn’t trust me because you don’t know me but you would take chance just like I did. My money got stuck on Coinbase a few weeks back and I ended up meeting someone I didn’t trust neither and the guy that ended up selling me BTC turned out to be my mentor and helped me and taught me how to invest.

@_date: 2017-11-23 08:51:06
My brother tested them out with $100 and I saw the entire process so I thought it was super easy. I figured I get serious and go in with $25K but now I see it was a terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:48:48
Scenario 1
March 1st 2018 - $8,950 per 1 BTC
March 1st 2019 - $68,059 per 1 BTC
March 1st 2020 - $517,536 per 1 BTC
March 1st 2021 - $3,935,454 Per 1 BTC
How I arrived at the above numbers........
July 17th 2010 bitcoin price was $0.05 (the price when it started TRADING)
and on Dec 6th 2010 bitcoin price was $375.00
Time interval between both dates is 1604 days or 53 months
The computed doubling time for Bitcoin worked out to be 4.1 months between the two dates
ie every 4.1 months over the 53 months time period , the price doubled
I then took the 27th Feb 2017 price of ($1177) as a start date &amp; price and using MS Excel's POWER Function in a spreadsheet projected it forward for the next 4 years again assuming it ( the price ) will be doubling every 4.1 months ( which is historically what it did between July 17th 2010 and December 6th 2010)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:26
Stay calm??? US just banned bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:53:29
Good luck, you’re going to need it
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:24:19
Get out of bitcoin, NOW! You don’t know what the heck your involved in
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:07:48
Calm the fuck down and invest in ETH
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:38:35
Yes, I hope I do as well. I’m tired of the old system we live in which is why I loved the idea of crypto currency
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:56:05
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:12:28
Thank you sooo much, I’m just very afraid of waiting any longer because i’ve read about so many people waiting months up to a year requesting their funds back. It’s been a very crazy experience for me.

I will never use them again, I hope others learn not to use them as I just found out they are not Licensed in California 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:25:50
I did the same day wire, Bank of America charged me $43
I know Coinbase Bank is Metropolitan Commercial Bank, I also called them with a Federal # and they stated that they received my wire transfer as well and stated that they sent the funds to coinbase the same day my wire went out.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:45:32
How?? If they are not even License by the Department or Business Oversight in California..

@_date: 2017-11-23 09:08:53
I agree. I just don’t get why they are paving the way as leaders in the crypto world....they are destroying it
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:27:00
That’s exactly what I thought. That’s why I felt safe depositing $25K, look at me now...
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:56:25
No good experience...leaving the crypto world after this 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:33:41
There is no limit to wire transfers
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:30:34
Yes, that’s the plan

The quickest way to NEVER buy the Lamborghini company is to buy a Lamborghini, NEVER FORGET THAT...buying cars, jewels etc slows you down 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:13:30
Yes :/ it really sucks that they have no customer service team to put your concerns at ease. $25K is a good chuck of change and getting no response and direction has made me fee very lost. Their website claims “same-day delivery” and now it’s been 6 business and no response to any emails and when I called them they had no idea and just advised me to email Wire Support. Wire support has not responded at all :(
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:18:03
It’s an exchange, I get it but it’s also your TOP entrance to get bitcoins here in the US

@_date: 2017-11-23 04:13:31
Thank you very much. I just don’t understand why Coinbase merchant bank has confirmed they received funds but Coinbase its self has not even acknolwged anything.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:46:02
I chose Coinbase because I liked that they were a California based company and FDIC insurance on your funds.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:43:03
They have been MIA with $25K that was wired to them 1 week ago. I called every day and emailed and had no response, no funds posted into my account...nothing...this has scared me a lot 
My bank account info matches my Coinbase account info too.
I don’t know what the problem is.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:23:08
I just trip out that they aren’t even licensed as a Money Transmission company in the state of California, I’m not sure how legit they are 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:05:09
Lol thanks for the heads up Haha 
But you’re right, 2018 looks great for Bitcoin...putting my life savings in lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:28:50

Of shit to me
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:17
Fuck coinbase, someone stole all their Bitcoins..
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:37:02

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:15:50
Stay away 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:35:58
Yes, I just contacted my bank (B of A) and requested a “wire-recall”....let’s hope that works...that’s crazy, I know they’re busy but  least get some good customer service or put a message on your website displaying how much time things are taking right now so we don’t end up feeling stranded and hopeless 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:59:31
My bank (Bank of America)  has verified all of that before considering the wire transfer. Why should Coinbase try to verify me for...
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:53:06
Their websites states “same-day delivery” if wired by 1pm
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:11:35
Fuck that, I just want enough to buy a home and get the fuck out lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:04:46
Thank you very much, I will try these exact steps :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:10:17
I think the problem here is that they been so unresponsive that it’s already scared me away. They have no customer service,

@_date: 2017-11-23 18:27:59
I like that idea better, meeting someone local to avoid taxes, scams and delays. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:55:43
Buy BTC from local people. Meet them at a coffee shop or at a bank and do the transaction with $0 fee
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:10:13
I would but I been reading different threads and it seems like the problem doesn’t get better from here...I have to jump now and address the problem when your gut feeling tells you

@_date: 2017-11-23 18:29:13
Yes, I hope I get it soon. I think they should be responsive and advise it’s users that wires/ach deposits take a while. The more communication the better relationship 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:33:48
The ones that own a lot of Bitcoins will become targets and they would have to detach themselves from their families.
Some are going to miss the opportunity on wealth and that alone will destroy them to the point of committing suicide...

Not good

@_date: 2017-11-23 09:05:25
Coinbase is a big player in the crypto world. If a big player does this what makes you think other companies won’t do the same...
If I get my money...I hope I do
