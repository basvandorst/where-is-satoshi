I run a decent Bitcoin directory. For the last 2.5 years been promoting Bitcoin to EVERYONE, everywhere, always.  The last 2 months, I have stopped. I don't feel right recommending something that could be drastically changed overnight, going to wait till a resolution to continue.   
   
I completely agree. This is a pissing match.  Nothing more. Money is involved.  It's hard to decipher between currency motivated decisions and functional purpose (for those who love Bitcoin but are not immersed in code all day)   
  


  
   
Spam is being overused like the word FUD in here.  People use it to classify a particular action that is always going to happen and arises logical questions.  So what if I decide to throw my pennies around. It is my money and I will do that as I please.  If spam transactions is the new word for that, well shit, I will leave here. Because for a guy who promotes freedom, anon and uncensorship, -ie. luke-jr, it is amazing to see that he would want to, basiclaly put limits on how people spend their currency.  
   
   
Anyhow. I don't know the answer. I do know every time i come across a luke-jr comment, it is 100% the opposite of my belief.  Representing anarchy 24/7 is good for a shitcoin, not a currency that is being utilized by legitimate businesses and growing numbers of ordinary people everyday.     
  
I would imagine there is plenty of ways to build infrastructure that is exclusive from the blockchain that helps a node run on tor.  Maybe it has been developed, maybe it hasn't, but scaling an entire payment network to accommodate what is holding it back is dumb.  Privacy is super important... but so is usage and transactions with a currency.  Is there really no alternative route to go? If there no tor alternative that increases bandwidth or whatever it is to pick up the slack? 
   
   
Spam transactions are a symptom, not the root of the problem luke-jr.  Spam transactions will be here tomorrow, the next day and the day after that.  If Bitcoin IS going to be as big as some of us wish, there will definitely be a tipping point at some time, and that is when you will realize how dumb it is to try and control "spam" ie. transactions that bitcoin promotes day in and day out as a core BENEFIT.

How so? Do I need to go through reddit and recall the vast number of posts (which I am sure you have commented on) in regards to people waiting hours for their transactions to go through?    
 Can you please describe how this is "no effect"?  Because, yes, there were people who were waiting a long time for transactions to clear...  And to turn the blind eye to this seems unproductive, just about as unproductive as this conversation.  I mean, one look at the response to your posts regarding this issue might lead one to believe you are either missing looking at this situation from all angles, or should open your mind to solutions regarding the matter.

Are there lawyers that would take a clear cut case such as this on the basis they get paid if you win?

It would be nice to know there is somewhere for these people to turn to in a case like this.

You cannot classify it as spam.   Spam will be here today,it will be here tomorrow.  Stress tests or not, you have to look at this like another day in Bitcoin.  No spam, just a regular day.

No, I didn't.  But thanks for chiming in.  There is no such thing as a spam transaction.  That is a useless term.  If they impact the network, and use it, they are transactions, adding "SPAM" is just emphasis on "don't look at me" "I am not important"... Well yeah, they are.   And if the resolution is a reddit post a week about "don't worry guys, it's just spam" this is a very unsustainable model.

Best ATM display yet. Now that is BBBBBBeautiful.  It's all about the setting!  Just plopping a Bitcoin ATM in the middle of nowhere, ie. 99% of the ones I have seen, doesn't really draw interest. This does.  Would love to see a live ticker one day, and perhaps an updating map of surrounding businesses accepting Bitcoin, and of course free marketing for the ones that do!  Maybe even a daily discount flash card for businesses that want to offer a discount for additional exposure. Don't mind my brainstorming lol

@_date: 2015-06-16 04:39:07
I like the advice given below, some very, VERY good points to consider.  Perhaps you could cater to the Bitcoin population without converting entirely into Bitcoin focus.  Kind of like a internet cafe that caters to Bitcoin users, but without targeting such a niche market, just focused on offering services that do.  Here goes some rambling of ideas that pop in my head....   
   
The locker service is actually a great idea, really like it.  Will you need to get licensing as a transmitter for this? Likewise, additional security risks?  If this is a cheap integration, i personally love the idea.   
    
As a tech based company, why not offer Bitcoin classes anyhow?  Perhaps since an ATM will be around, it would be cool to keep your current image, but be the heart of the Bitcoin ecosystem around you.  Promote and partner with businesses around you willing to accept Bitcoin.  Some low cost flyers targeted at the benefits for local businesses to accept, perhaps some educational nights for them. Also, perhaps around the ATM, a local directory for those businesses in the area accepting Bticoin so users are inclined to have a reason to try... Likewise, in return, those businesses can send their customer to the Bitcoin ATM in your location to load up.  
    
   
I see ATM locations as a great place to get an ecosystem going, and if it's in your location it's up to you to get everyone involved for educational purposes.  I think this would be a great start and a low cost method of bringing clients, and establishing a presence in the surrounding community.  With a few retailers on board for co promotions you really extend your reach to their clientele, but also extend your clients to them.  Win win without converting completely, just widening your offerings and availability to those who want to learn.
     
It's tough to know where to cut costs or look for revenue generation without understanding the business in it's entirety, but I know your oyster is going to be in local, highly involved marketing that distinguishes your brand from other internet cafe's in the area. A localized Bitcoin project (node or miner that brings people back to check on, perhaps somehow driven/funded by the local community for some sort of involvement prize) membership savings, coffee happy hours, computer time based happy hours, low ATM rate happy hours, loyalty coffee cards, computer time rewards, branded merchandise that receives a discount when worn to your location, unique drinks and lattes from the cup up, and utilizing the lowest cost methods to reach the most individuals living, and passing by the surrounding area... How is your shop front, space for appealing signage?  Perhaps a sidewalk in the front that can be utilized for additional signage or a catchy message with daily deals or offerings unique to the area...  I can imagine there is a bunch of competition in the area, establishing presence and culture around your brand is pretty important to standing out in the area... What is it going to take to get client A to tell friend B why your business is awesome, or unique.  
  
In my mind, the first step is understanding how much revenue is estimated for each body that walks in the door.. is it lower than expected? Is there a way to increase this by offering a new fixed cost service, or product with great margins such as merchandise?   Maybe that number is fine and the focus needs to be devoted to bringing more clients into the door... Info nights, gaming nights, competitions, video screenings, seasonal promotions, perhaps a Bitcoin club which brings in local speakers... Lots to consider depending upon your current offerings and direction you wish to go, but i think you need to use your location to it's full potential. Maybe ask your clients how your team could improve.   
  
Wish you the best... You are already miles ahead of lots of us.  An internet cafe is something I dream of doing in the future.  But I know that when you need to save coin, creativity is your greatest asset, just don't limit your offerings to something that might not appeal to current or future clients. 
   
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:11:31
People throw pennies around ALL day.  When you are dealing with currency, people's money... you cannot call it spam transactions, or tell them what to do with it... So we now censor micro transactions, one of Bitcoin's core benefits, nice.  I don't care if they are purposely doing this they are making a point.  Spam transactions = SCAPEGOAT term for a real issue that we will see in the future.

They are a rather heavily backed organization with a number of well known and smart individuals on the team.  I have faith that this was a miss-communication or a lapse in customer service, but all in all I strongly believe they are not a scam and do their best to maintain positive relations with the community.  I had a chance to speak with their team for a lengthy discussion early in my Bitcoin days and it left me with quite a positive outlook on the brand.  I hope your issue gets settled in a reasonable fashion.

Sooo, your glass is half empty?  There's two ways to look at everything.  The reality of how a completely new model of finance, and peer to peer value exchange has made exponential progress in such a short time, or whatever you said.  
   
Did you expect everyone in the world to be a Bitcoin holder over night? Not going to happen for a while, not next year, not the year after that.  But countries without financial access will be adopting it at growing rates.  People who find utility for it will reap its benefits. And once the barriers to entry reduce with innovation, this will happen at an increasing rate. Time.  This place is full of un realistic extremes, that yeah, will leave you disappointed if you think over night it will sole the worlds problems.

There seems to be some sort of entitlement that users in here can dictate exactly what services provide them.  I think some people need a refresher, that if an organization is providing a service, and you do not follow the rules, there is a good chance they will not serve you.  Every service is unique with their policies, but at the end of the day, they are the one providing it. If you would prefer to work by your own rules, you are free to create your own platform.  I would imagine there is a reason behind this, perhaps overlapping from the promotions when they were handing out free Bitcoin for accounts. Regardless, a reddit post isn't going to decipher the end policies of an entire organization.   
   
Like the other users, and the email from Circle said, you are free to use another email.  If you don't want to, I don't really see a reasonable explanation why Circles policies should adjust for your individual case...

Wasteful transactions? No wasteful transactions, can you point to where I suggested this? Who are you to judge what someone is sending.  Do you worry about what denominations of cash your neighbours are using?  If they drop a penny, or give you a nickel... Probably not.  Why should it be different here?     
  
And if the transactions are effecting the network, why should the term "spam transactions" be the solution to the issue?  I am asking logical questions that don't make sense to me.  Do you believe in the future these micro payments will cease because people understand it is negative for the network?  Would you not agree that preventing this from happening all together might be a benefit to Bitcoins future usage?  I just don't see reddit threads that suggest, don't worry about your 5 hour confirmation, it's just spam, as a viable future solution.  Am I missing something all together?   
    
Thanks kindly for the welcome.
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:43:32

@_date: 2015-06-17 16:02:41
When people send and receive currency, there is no such thing as spam.  Just because you have a spam tab on your email, doesn't mean people have stopped sending it.  It comes, and it comes, it will not stop.  It doesn't matter who or how they send it.  the quicker these "spam" transactions are thought of "regular" transactions, the quicker the infrastructure will adapt.  The longer spent on tying to "locate spam transactions" the longer we run on the same spot.  Sorry but, adding subjectivity to transactions in a financial system is probably not the best route, and believing that someone can distinguish the two is questionable.    
   
  
So, raise the default fees, and you believe it's all over. Not how it works. Quick adjustment and continue the rapid micro transactions.  Cost effective or not.  Some people devote currency to negative things, and to think because i is not economical it wont happen, is honestly, comical at best.   Trying to filter spam, is NOT a viable solution. It seems to me like a bandaid on a wound that needs surgery or at least stitches.

Going to copy and paste this again, because perhaps increasing fees is a viable solution, but it would be nice if you could maybe suggest a potential way that it would work in it's entirety.... "Raise fees" is the idea, how will it actually function in practice?  When we hit a larger then average volume of transactions, how does higher fees come into play with regards to the transactions not backing as seen with the microtransactions? What is a good estimation of fee size? Is it a standard for all transactions?  How will they work into current software, what will need to be changed?  How will the average joe understand what an acceptable fee is and where will they get this knowledge with all these "shitty" wallets out there?   
   
   


     
    
       
I am not trying to be rude or anything if that is how i am coming off,  trying to understand how larger fees interact with volume of transactions, and what exactly the benefit would be to everyone using Bitcoin, not just the miners.  I think we need to look at ALL angles of the picture, to understand a complete solution that leaves nobody stranded.

So how does this play into our exchange about these micro transactions not effecting anything? Clearly they do.  Clearly they are not going to stop in the future.  Clearly, something needs to be changed so when a stress test happens, or when someone decides to fire a whole bunch of transactions to a whole bunch of parties, it won't effect everyone else using Bitcoin.    
   
The assumptions in this post    


    
Would suggest quite the contrary to your responses in our discussion  -     


    
  
or   
  


    
     
I am still failing to see where these two are mutually exclusive.  So, with the assumption that stress tests will not stop in the near future, or that people will continue to send lots of miniature transactions, or as adoption increases more transactions will do the same thing, can you explain to me, how everything is fine the way it is?  Again, I am just trying to understand where you are coming from, and I can't begin in the slightest to understand how this is not a viable issue that should be dealt with.

What is your suggestion for an increase in fees, value wise... Do you think this will effect Bitcoin's ability to be used for micro transactions, one of it's core benefits? Also, is this something that would work in accordance with the wallet software that everyone is using (ie. each wallet provider would update to automatically process at the effective fee)? Raising fees would basically discourage micro transactions, so I don't really see how that tackles an issue of large volume.... which in the event that a more costly stress test was to occur, we would be in the exact same position as before? Do you mind expanding? And if not, is there a way to distribute the correct information to every new comer, everyone using Bitcoin currently, that if you do not manually increase the fee in your wallet, you are going to have a transaction lost in translation for days at a time? 
   


   
I do not believe you are looking at this situation from any other side of the picture but the one currently in your mind.   What is meaningless to you, could be a reason another person uses Bitcoin. ie, transacting tiny amounts of currency on a global scale without an intermediary service.    
   
Are you a miner?
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:15:13
Then the system should be designed so when people decide to drop their pennies, it doesn't effect everyone else in the world.  Maybe that means block size, maybe it means a creative solution implemented by wallet software / service providers... maybe the solution hasn't been thought of yet.  Not sure what the solution is, but doing nothing about it... just doesn't seem like a proactive future decision.

How does another coin Benefit from Bitcoin's downfall?  Bitcoin is the front runner and the poster child for what people understand about this peer to peer decentralized currency idea. If Bitcoin fails it will be a VERY long time before anyone reconsiders any sort of decentralized currency.   IMO Bitcoin failing has little to do with any other cryptocurrency succeeding and everything to do with people's lost faith that an ecosystem like this can work out.  I think it's in every altcurrencies / crypto related innovations' best interest for Bitcoin to succeed.
