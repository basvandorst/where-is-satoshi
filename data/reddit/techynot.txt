It sucks and just confirms what we already knew about this exchange. They're amateurs.
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:38:00
You asshole. So not only are u stealing from us but you will allow preferential exit from ur sinking ship to verified customers and "greenlined" accounts.
How stupid do u think we are? Prepare for a lawsuit and having ur bank accounts frozen asap.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:41:11
How much traffic
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:56:18
Asshole get ready to be sued
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:49:36
Why verified are preferential? Because they will get their USD out first and when the lawsuit hits us unverified accounts will have to eat that loss too like we just ate the loss from the synapse USD accounts.
Our alternative is to buy BTC which u must know will trade at a premium min 10-20% right after u open. So at no fault to our own, we will get a haircut over 50% when our accounts weren't even hacked.
Im warning you, do not open doors until everyone is verified and ur accounts are fully audited. This process should take several weeks minimum. Otherwise you will get sued and have ur bank frozen, I guarantee it.

Thats assuming they sell all equity which is highly unlikely. They want to keep control.

How do you know. If Snowden was a plant, then you can bet the Russians have plants in other departments of the US government. 
''Hello senor Ivan. We need to know when the US revokes snowden's passport.''
Then they conveniently scheduled to have Snowden in Moscow at the exact time when his passport got revoked. And don't forget to have a bunch of journalists follow him around the airport! Cmon....that whole thing stinks...
The KGB gave Castro the exact date of the Bay of Pigs invasion.
The Russians may not be good at much but they are good at spying.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:00:11
Snowden isn't god you know. We don't know how much of the stuff he peddles is real and how much is made up BS.
Add to this the fact that he hid in Russia, a highly belligerent nation to the West with a history of strong intelligence agencies (that's how they got the atomic bomb) and it seems plausible that he was a FSB-plant all along.
So I take anything he says with a huge grain of SALT.
Russia is one of the few countries out there that plans to outright ban bitcoin, with threat of prison and huge fines.

Oh how fucking convenient to get stuck inside fucking Russia just at the exact time his fucking passport got revoked.
I'm just waiting for the truth on this asshole to come out, he is no fucking freedom fighter like you're trying to portray him. Just give it some 20-30 years to declassify old russian archives. Just like we got a ton of shit declassified after the soviet union fell, including the famous clause to divide up Poland with the nazis.

Nope, they're going to Switzerland. The head of the SNB just said that part of the reason for the negative rates imposed today is inflows of Russian money.
Don't forget that russia has not deployed capital controls, yet. There are plenty of other options for Russians at the moment

Whatever, the russians have a history of pulling this type of shit so I'm completely rational. But according to you it's all one big fucking coincidence. I wonder if the same happened with a US spy planted in moscow, who happened to have his passport revoked at the exact time he was in Washington DC, would you ''buy'' the official story that he's just an innocent party fighting for the privacy of russians? I doubt it. 
That fucking rat probably releases 1 true doc and 9 false. It's only a matter of time until journalists start fact checking him BS. His latest crap is off the charts insane. As things heat up between the US/Moscow I fully expect the rat to peddle outlandish conspiracy theories to help his master putin.

So he says. I'm not saying all docs are fake but u take some truth and u mix in all this garbage and we don't know whats real anymore.
He fled to russia because he is working for FSB imo. It's naive to think that the russians didn't have a hand in this, given their KGB history. It's also very naive to bealive his offical story that he happened to be in moscow at the exact time his passport got cancelled.
Give me a break.
@_date: 2014-11-27 09:58:38


well DUH. My point still stands, most traders in Gox were Americans so picking Kraken makes 0 sense. 
Also way to jump to conclusions bro. Who's to say that BTC will be returned as BTC? 
Maybe it will all be liquidated to limit losses while the proceedings drag on? These things can last for years. Since the start of this mess, the 200,000 coins have lost over 50% of its value.
In addition, at the time of the blowup a lot of people converted to USD on the belief that Japanese authorities will give priority to claimants with USD/JPY claims over BTC.
One more point, as I understand it, on Kraken/Coinbase you HAVE TO VERIFY before you can do anything. 
My take on this is the trustee is expecting this to drag on for years. He's preparing a system where he can sell the BTC and eventually distribute the cash to claimants.
Think about it. If the BTC was to be returned as BTC, why bother with getting a partner in Kraken? Everything will be sold and distributed by Kraken, they will rip a massive commission on the 200,000 BTC deal

funny, the next sentence says this


Personally I never had a major problem with Moneybookers, knock on wood. 
Also unlike shitty bitcoin exchanges (Coinbase,Kraken etc...) , there is no AML crap until you trigger some of the ACTUAL AML LIMITS STATED IN THE LAWS. So none of this per-emptive BS ''we'll collect IDs from every single one of our users in case the Feds ask us in the future''.
so yeah, pretty cool
@_date: 2014-11-26 12:59:50
WTF is this shit






Why would you force people to open a Kraken account and go through YET ANOTHER VERIFICATION?
Also isn't Kraken BTC to EUR exchanges? I guess Americans will now be raped with Forex fees plus bank fees just to get their BTC out?
So after Japanese authorities proved completely incompetent on this matter, they sell out the accounts to Kraken. Crony Capitalism at its finest but I guess that goes with the territory in Japan.
@_date: 2014-11-26 13:26:47

Btw companies will also run those offchain payment solutions after segwit passes.  Most payments will go through 1-2 companies like coinbase and bitpay. Hows that for centralization?
