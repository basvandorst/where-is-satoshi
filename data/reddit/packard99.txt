Hello Pineapple,
I've been trying to purchase Antminer S9's ASIC hardware to create a mining farm and donate to research for Multiple Sclerosis and Tinnitus.
I so far have collected 6,000 euros and I am waiting for 2 S9's in January 9th delivery.
My idea is to donate 60% of all my profits to researchers. Imagine if you have 15x14,7/th antminer s9's mining all at once. I could donate over 10k per month, for life.
Imagine if you have 150 of those, I could donate more than 100k USD per month...
I am trying to donate them because I myself have been suffering from Tinnitus past 8 years and MS symptoms have been progressing past 3 years. It's not a thing you want in your life but you can't do nothing about it, especially those damn medicines that have so many bad-sides that may even worsen condition.
If you are interested and have a trust in me, that I could pull this off, I would love to send  you a PM with more info how my plan would go. If it helps, I could name it Pineapple MTÜ (Meaning Pineapple NON-PROFIT-ORGAZINATION) in our country.
Even a donation of bitcoin mining hardware would be better since I would have to buy those anyway with the money donated, my whole goal was and still is to run 15 antminer s9's - two of them I could afford, rest is still to gain. Even when you won't donate, no problems, I understand that you help alot and that is f*****g unbelievable. 
Faith in humanity restored. Thanks Pineapple!
