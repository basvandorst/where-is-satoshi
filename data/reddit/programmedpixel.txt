Guess as a programmer: Well, for starters, before you use a bitcoin wallet, you should always take a look at the codebase, or at least the bits that handle sensitive information. Are they being transmitted? Bad sign. Are they being stored in memory? You might need to look around and check that they are not being transmitted. Also for open source wallets there are many developers who keep their eyes on the code and each other - if anyone did anything fishy, it would probably be looked into before the next release, so it would only affect people who are using the absolute latest commit and then it would probably not make it into master. Running of the latest commit is bad when it comes to your hard-earned bitcoin. If you are using a closed-source wallet, however, try monitoring network traffic when you generate your wallet. If after a few minutes (adjust for paranoia level) you don't see anything out of the ordinary then it's probably safe. As for online wallets then you are pretty much just trusting that the execs at the company will not go evil and that your bitcoins are safe. That's why you shouldn't keep too much bitcoin in an online wallet.

Oops: As for the "change it back" all history for an open source project is usually stored in source control, usually Git. Git keeps a log of every line of code in every file you tell it to track, so you can easily go back in time and look at the code as it was for each individual change.
