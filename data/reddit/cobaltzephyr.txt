Moved, and switched phones. Lost hard and soft backups and 1.5 btc. *Goes to cry in a corner*

Nothing's better than moving and switching from Apple to Android. Fucks sake, there goes 1.5 btc. *Turns over and cries*

Burying it in the yard is a good idea, I'll use it next time I get some good luck.

Thanks for the suggestion, if only I new about these methods when I made the backups when I was 15 -_-

Fingers crossed, I had my parents send me it since it was my last backup, but after it arrived in Edmonton the tracking software started erroring out. I have post workers on the case, but it seems that someone intercepted it in transit for some reason. The only thing I can think of is that my parents made the package a little too conspicuous and someone pilfered it.
Edit: This is my luck in general, so I'm honestly not surprised it happened. *Sigh*

I'd like to think that, now I'm just wallowing in depression as I somehow managed to lose 5 seperate backups all in the span of 2 weeks.

2 corrupted files (crossover from Apple to Android), one stolen flash drive with an encrypted file hidden on it(someone stole my keychain). 1 lost in transit hard copy in a portfolio (package was sent to somewhere in Edmonton and disappeared), and 1 destroyed hard copy (movers knocked it into some water ruining the ink, and a lot of banking documents.) I've had a very harsh few weeks.

Just goes to show that there are never enough backups

Why'd I have to lose my wallet backup code NOW OF ALL TIMES!?!!!
