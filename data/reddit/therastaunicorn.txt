It wont 100% secure your future though... that's not a smart way to think.
She is expecting a ring don't be retarded, if you really want it to be Bitcoin then make a custom ring with a micro USB containing 1 bitcoin.

You can make educated guesses based on past performance. I think it's much more likely to reach 20k and beyond.
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:08:36
Don't cry, just hodl. It will get to 100k by December 2022 or I will eat a handful of rocks and live stream it.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:37:42
Have fun with your remote controlled Lambo.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:36:31
When it is worth $50k people will be saying the same thing about 10k.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:33:04
Or just buy now and hold... because in the long run a few K is peanuts.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:23:41
Such ignorance. Much wow.

I hate to the bearer of reality news, but Bitcoin is not anywhere close to breaking into the mainstream. 
People won't be getting paid in Bitcoin anytime soon. It will take at least several more decades or a massive financial collapse like Venezuela before crypto can compete with traditional fiat. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:10:01
New customers will try Bitcoin Cash, get scammed, and never go back to BTC again.
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:44:44
With clues like that I think you are trolling. Especially with this removed comment:
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:37:32
He didn't mention any of that, he just said that there are very few legal reasons to use more than 10k in cash. It's also been illegal to fly with more than 10k in undeclared cash for decades....
Many normal people think the same way, and if you go all crazy on them they will never adopt to crypto.
PS: I am invested in Bitcoin so don't lynch me please.
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:27:56
Calm down... I never mentioned anything that is related to what you are saying. I also hate banks, but I don't like being my own bank. I like crypto and I think it is the future.
If you want to fight the system you need to do it in a smarter way. When you spread gospel it drives the average person away, and for bitcoin to succeed it needs to be accessible by the average person. Simple fact.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:35:39
You do have a point... but people in this sub will blindly defend anything that is even slightly suggestive against crypto so prepare for downvotes and death threats.

The only reason why someone would feel the need to create a Bitcoin solution is because poker is banned in many countries.
This is what happens when you give people freedom to do what they want with their money, as it should be.
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:12:58
But it doesn't
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:50:18
Lol. People use cards because they don't want to carry around wads of cash &amp; spare change in their already cramped wallet. Also with credit/debit cards you can do a chargeback and get your money back, while with BTC its gone forever.
Don't lynch me I'm just telling the facts.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:00:04
That's not how chargebacks work... but ok.
No personal offence because you are probably under 18, it's ok to fuck the system, but your attitude is what makes normal people think Bitcoin is full of crazies.
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:21:27
If it got messed up somehow then it wasn't correctly written.

Doing it right would be sending those responsible to jail, or at least permanently banning them from the financial sector, like Iceland did.

*Laughs* in pennies.
@_date: 2019-06-30 06:44:21
If these whales wanted to keep the price below 12k, then they would need to sell their coins when it reached 12k. That doesn't fit their motive of buying all the coins.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:40:41
If it pays for a Lambo then it's not useless. Just like the useless numbers in your bank statement.
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:43:59


Bullshit. You just threw all your credibility out the window.
Also I am not poor I am actually fairly wealthy... the pennies thing was a joke about my fellow Americans who are still fucked from 2008.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:10:58
Bitcoin is simply not stable enough. Why don't you spend all of *your* bitcoin on drinks? Because if you're not retarded you know that in 1 month those drinks could be worth half or twice as much.
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:32:32
You are thinking about investing wrong. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and don't expect to withdraw your money for the next couple of years. If you can't do these 2 things, then don't invest.

Plenty of countries have socialist elements like free healthcare, even the US has some, although in the US people die and suffer because they don't have health insurance and moronic imbeciles such as your self think "socialism is bad hurf durf" and vote against it.
@_date: 2019-04-14 19:29:46
Free health care doesn't work? Are you autistic or are you just repeating stuff you heard on TV like a parrot?
@_date: 2019-04-14 19:21:47
It's not even close to the same as America. In America you don't starve and you're not homeless with minimum wage, and you have electricity.
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:16:59
"Parrot" haha.
@_date: 2019-04-14 18:17:13
That's the point, their minimum wage is really minimum, it's the absolute minimum you can barely survive on.
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:35:30
While Bitcoin may use a lot of electricity, I think that the energy consumed from printing and transporting physical currency to ATM's and banks far exceeds the energy used by BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-31 09:19:46
My point is exactly that, banks do more physical stuff.
If BTC became the global currency there would be an energy improvement, not a decline like people think.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:36:06
If you're a millionaire it wouldn't really suck...
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:56:06
Trolling or not, it's true. Have you tried to buy Bitcoin recently? It's improved but it's still shady as fuck.
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:53:15
This is the internet, not America. Also the stock exchange is global...

@_date: 2018-04-06 07:03:00


Lol what? You are saying there are no criminals in Sweden?
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:40:34
That's a complete lie. Unless you are doing something illegal they have no just reason to hold your money for 6 months, and there is no other payment processor in the world that does this.
They openly admit to putting your money in interest accounts for the 6 months, and they make millions from it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:38:44
There are grocery stores that accept BTC?
It seems there are still a lot of things you can't buy from BTC transactions, even in the EU.
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:19:05
Paypal is probably the most profitable criminal company in the USA. What they do is wait until you have a sizable amount of money and then they find a reason to close your account. Your money is held for 6 months while they make interest off of it, or in some cases not returned to you at all. Have bills or debts to pay? Their reps will laugh at you.
They have illegally held multiple millions of dollars, closed accounts, and damaged the lives of many thousands of small business owners, my self included. 
Fuck Paypal, I hope their executives get burned.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:07:54
How though? You've probably needed to convert that BTC to fiat to pay for a lot of things...
So not really.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:59:31
Nope, but the copied company can try to sue.
