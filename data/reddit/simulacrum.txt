Hi, I made the survey.  Cheers for the feedback, I've adjusted the comment under that question to remind people that it's as optional as every other question, and I explicitly discourage people from including personal info!

It's an economy where people give stuff to each other instead of buying or swapping stuff. It usually refers to early human exchange systems, where people would share any kind of windfall (be it food, hides, important information, symbolic tokens etc) with their friends and family, on the assumption that the favour would be returned in some way at some point in the future.

This.  Early adopters are really hard to reach because they're less engaged than they when were when they joined years ago, and/or they're now living on a yacht.

See if you can get a sense of how much he understands the protocol, and where he's getting his information from.  Has he read Satoshi's paper?  The Wikipedia page?  (a better starting point than most) Has he played with the blockchain himself?  Or is he just watching CNN and reading the Economist?

Too late to add it now, but I guess investor is the closest one there, though I realise it has a different emphasis.

There is an ongoing survey [here]( that you're more than welcome to take!  It goes into a bit more detail and is a mix of questions from the community and some academics looking at Bitcoin politics etc.  Goal is 1000 responses (to match last year's).

Oh man...you think that's a cultural insensitivity, try coming up with a language list that doesn't offend speakers of Serbian, Croatian, or Serbo-Croatian.  Minefield.

It also happens all the time with small-denomination coins, where the commodity value of the metal used is worth more than the face value of the coin (eg in Russia a 1 Kopeck coin [costs 45 Kopecks]( to make, largely because of the copper, nickel, and steel it contains). That said I imagine collecting and melting a worthwhile quantity of coloured satoshis would be easier than collecting and melting small coins.

Not quite that clear cut, the British convention is to make the decision based on context, i.e. whether the collective noun in question is behaving in a singular or plural manner ([source]( Reddit *is* hiring, no question.
If there is a hard and fast rule it's the same as in American English: "A government, a party, a company (whether Tesco or Marks and Spencer) and a partnership (Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill) are all it and take a singular verb."
Obviously there's colloquial variation, but standard British English is similar to American English on this.

So with a sufficiently long random string of valid characters there's a 1 in 2^32 (about 1 in 4.3 billion) chance of accidentally getting a correct checksum.
Are the odds the same in a standard typo situation (ie 1-2 characters away from a valid string) or is like the Luhn checksum that it's even more difficult to have the same checksum for similar strings?

Thank you!  I think the gift economy that creeps in with Bitcoin is as exciting as the currency itself.

OK thanks everyone, we're now safely over a thousand!  I have marked the survey as closed, but I won't literally close it because I know some people will be curious to see what questions were asked.

Yup, and if they don't have any marketable skill that can be easily sold online they're in trouble.  I think city-based Craigslist/Gumtree style boards would be more likely to result in actual transactions.

You could talk about the cultural meaning of money, especially physical money (the only money we had for 100,000 years).  Marc Shell has written a lot about the relationship between coinage and its importance to human understanding of things like truth and authority.
Then you have people like Vasillii Rozanov who focused on the metaphysical role of coinage, as something that connects us with the ancient civilizations of the past, and an intentional legacy we leave for the future.

No one is denying that there are contingents of users who are gamblers and hedonists, the point is that there is also a considerable group of users that might be described as sensible or restrained.  Maybe ascetic was too strong a word.  It's really tough to talk about this kind of thing in morally neutral language!
@_date: 2013-02-27 01:17:51
Aha...you have walked right into a trap!  I would love to be more granular in the political definitions but the problem is that one word can have many meanings.  Technocracy in Europe tends to refer to rule by experts, EU officials are often referred to as technocrats because they are usually recruited from academia and industry, rather than elected or trained in house.  This is different from a Silicon Valley view of technocracy, which might be defined as "rule by technology and technologists".
Don't even get me started on the different meanings of the word "liberal".

45 responses so far btw

Some highlights:
* The average user is a 31.7 year old libertarian male.
* Top motivators for new users are curiosity, profit, and politics.
* Bitcointalk.org is the dominant community platform.
* Far more people have used Bitcoin to make donations than to buy narcotics.
* 39% of users do not drink, smoke, gamble, or take drugs.

They price it in USD but accept Bitcoin (with Bitpay) at point of sale.

Very valid point, the responses are purposely broad to keep them manageable and I think ancap belongs largely with libertarianism.  I've expanded the two anti-statist responses, drawing the distinction between competing views on property rights: one is now  "Anarchist / Syndicalist / Anarcho-Collectivist", the other is "Libertarian / Anarcho-Capitalist".
I should add that I don't think a Nolan Chart answers all our problems, it doesn't really have a place for green parties (big in Europe) or faith-based parties (big in Muslim world).
@_date: 2013-02-26 19:42:17
Yep, I agree entirely and I do hope more answer over time.  That said, some of the trends (especially age and gender) are unlikely to be any different over a larger sample size.
