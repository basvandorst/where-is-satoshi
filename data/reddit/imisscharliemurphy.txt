So... Because 12,500 coins are issued per week and LBC's volume exceeds that, LBC is responsible for the upwards price trend? Your economics teacher has failed you. Do you really think that the miners are selling their coins in Walmart parking lots?

Everything is good for Bitcoin, simpleton. Full blocks, empty blocks, low fees, high fees, no fees, lots of miners, no miners, high hash rate, hash browns, all of it. You dig?
