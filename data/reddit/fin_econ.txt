I think the ad has a series of transactions.
1. An exchange in Kenya via SMS text messaging
2. A depiction of different people donating to a relief effort.
3. Somone remitting money to a grandparent/parent
4. A hipster buying a friend a beer across the country
5. A mom and pop transaction
And Finally…someone getting on the aircraft to go to space
with a tag line to the foundation/wikipedia or reddit for that matter

Article from 2009 and issue regarding qq coin and tencent has been put on the table many times. QQ was centralized, bitcoin is not. Also Chinese central banker hinted at bitcoin as permissable if not recognized last week. Troll.

The tech. Think about the network that developed without a centralized entity having to make the huge capital investment, needing to control the entire thing. This is powerful stuff.

This will be great for proving ownership transfers, authenticity of works of art, autographs--maybe even chain of custody in legal settings.

What about a big name in the spot?

Financial industry lobbyists will play a big role--look at what happened in Dodd-Frank. It all depends if they can spin it to their advantage somehow-- maybe licensing requirements for exchanges--KYC and AML requirements and fees to the large financial institutions.  
It's also interesting to note that the FBI is sitting on a pretty large stash right now, I'd think they wouldn't let the air out of it until they cash out.
Also increase in volatility.

That is an endorsement, no doubt.

They are a huge franchise though and there are those that own multiple franchises.
They also tend to share 'best practices'.

FWIF From the MBOA research note put out today:
As a rough analogy, suppose competing journalists (miners) are asked todocument the national news on each given day for the National Archives1. The journalist is asked to write down the events (transactions) in a book (block) and
the Archive will eventually buy one such book for a fixed fee. To determine whichof the books the Archive will buy the archive has an additional requirement for journalists that the book contains the fingerprints of 10 people whose birthday
was on that particular day. Note that the list of people isn’t related to the nationalnews (transactions) but is simply meant to control the supply of books comingout per day. As more journalists collaborate to find people, the Archive increases
the number of fingerprints required.

To a bitcoin enthusiast all returns look small.
