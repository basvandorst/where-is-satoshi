The article seems less affirmative than the title. Looks like we're more into conditional.
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:46:39
It's a very risky strategy. Some would talk about good debt with this kind of investment but I don't like it too much, actually.
@_date: 2019-07-22 08:47:27
The decision makes sense. It would be a heresy if India (or another country) voted a ban on cryptocurrencies.

Without taking into account the revolutionary side of Bitcoin and all that it will bring to society in the future, it must be admitted that Bitcoin is easier to buy than gold or real estate.
Bitcoin is divisible up to the 8th decimal, so anyone can buy even a small portion of it.
 Ideal to discover this universe.

I agree, but at the same time, the CEO of Binance has no interest in saying anything other than that.
@_date: 2019-11-18 12:48:31
Another huge advantage of Bitcoin compared to fiat currencies and the current banking system.

It would be better to provide Bitcoins to everyone Mr Yang.

Although I thank Bjarne Stroustrup every day for inventing C ++, I think he is overwhelmed by Bitcoin and the revolution it embodies. What he says on the subject does not surprise me so much.
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:27:49
Mass adoption continues on its way.
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:26:21
So true.
And the Bitcoin has always risen even stronger than before.
I can't wait for 2020!
@_date: 2019-11-15 09:47:49
Nothing new in my opinion!
You have to keep a budget each month and buy it on a regular basis.
This method of accumulation has already proven itself on the stock market for years and is still valid on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-16 10:52:08
High or Low, just buy and HODL because Bitcoin price will be higher in some years.
@_date: 2019-11-15 09:48:27
Many people in developed countries are not aware of the extraordinary opportunity Bitcoin for Africa for example.
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:36:11
Drop the shitcoins and buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:58:12
Astonishing to see Xi Jinping's radical shift of opinion on Blockchain and Bitcoin now. Is this to do with the trade war with the United States?
In any case, it seems positive for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-09 09:39:11
Better advice than this of George Soros:
Step 1: Buy, HODL
Step 2: Go To Step 1

99% of the cryptocurrencies on the market do not bring anything new.
They are clearly carried by Bitcoin and the euphoria that surrounds it. 
This article seems perfectly logical.
@_date: 2019-11-12 15:49:08
It is certain that millennials will favor the mass adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-11-20 09:41:14
Great video with a good explanation that everyone can understand.
@_date: 2019-11-09 09:51:27
Great news. It's time to buy more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-15 10:37:46
Things are changing fast now.
Xi Jinping's Chinese turnaround will benefit Bitcoin.

Bitcoin will not replace the USD but it will grow next to it by setting a new standard of greater value in the long term.

Is not it dangerous to start a such mining farm in Texas just a few months before the next Bitcoin Halving?
The timing seems tricky.
@_date: 2019-11-19 09:21:51
All this was already known, it seems to me, but the article remains interesting anyway.
@_date: 2019-11-08 13:52:47
 "Bitcoin fear and greed index actually is at 42  down by 6 points from yesterday’s 54."
Next week will be really interesting!

Interesting article about the Halving and its potential impacts on Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2019-11-18 08:14:59
Great illustration.
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:55:35
Not so high for Bitcoin.

Is the euro in its current form not already more than 90% digital?
What is the point of this digital currency controlled by the EU?
What more will it bring to the fight against Facebook's Libra?
@_date: 2019-11-16 10:50:19
Now, you have just to HODL!
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:06:25
When China again allows crypto exchanges on its territory, we can expect a boom in the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:49:38
The system is already built with Bitcoin. JP Morgan is now afraid of its mass adoption by the general public.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:15:23
Great achievement for the Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-22 12:25:34
Everything is good for selling paper and associating Bitcoin with criminal activities makes selling.

Bitcoin will save the world!

There is no reason to oppose Bitcoin and Gold. The two are perfect investments for the future.
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:12:45
Both options can coexist in the future.
@_date: 2019-10-20 14:57:12
Bitcoin is the only way for a digital global currency to be a great success while being totally decentralized, non-sovereign and based on a model that requires no leader.
It is explained in details here: [**"Bitcoin Will Emerge Stronger From The Failure Of The Facebook’s Libra"**](
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:42:54
The image is funny.
It should also be added that some people bought this Bitcoin in December 2017 but sold it in 2018 when the Bitcoin was at $3000 ...
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:48:38
Gold is very good but Digital Gold (Bitcoin) is far better ;)
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:15:33
Excellent post but you should change your tool to make charts :)
@_date: 2019-10-03 06:06:04
I am wary of this type of ads to seduce. I am waiting to see what it proposes concretely to support cryptocurrencies.
I take the example of France where the Minister of Economy said he wanted to make the country a crypto leader in Europe before announcing a few months later the implementation of a tax of 30% on realized capital gains in cryptocurrencies!
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:58:25
Is there the same infographic for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-15 13:21:42
Better, Faster, Cheaper ... All is said!
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:21:13
Good decision. Buying Bitcoin at $10,000 was already great. So, it's better at $7,500.
@_date: 2019-10-22 11:58:03
What is the purpose of running a full Bitcoin node on a smartphone?
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:51:09
Really nice. Bitcoin is perfect for this type of use as well.
@_date: 2019-10-22 12:37:36
Mass adoption by the general public also involves the education of as many people as possible.
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:02:00
It would be great for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-09 07:17:40
Bitcoin is the solution with a weak monetary and financial system.
@_date: 2019-12-20 18:02:59
Thanks ;)
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:11:33
The situation is delicate but this is what happens when you depend on a private organization with a centralized system.
Google has its own rules and does not respect its contributors.
This is true on YouTube but also on the Google Play Store or Adsense.
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:39:16
So true. Uber Airbnb or Snap are disappointing in the stock market.
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:20:00
If you choose to be a HODLER, you don't need these widgets.
Just HODL!
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:16:48
It's the best thing to do now.
Accumulate Bitcoins to get a maximum when the price has peaked.
Once Bitcoin is mass adopted, it will be time to move from accumulation to use.
@_date: 2019-12-09 12:15:11
It is useless to try to compare Bitcoin with the current system.
Bitcoin is a totally different new system that comes up in solution to the current system that is failing.
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:26:34
Deutsche Bank will probably not be around to see that in 2030.
@_date: 2019-12-28 09:01:44
An error or a test?
It seems too big to be a simple mistake.
I hope all these YouTubers will take this as a warning and leave YouTube to give decentralized platforms such as DTube a chance to grow.
They are less lucrative but help to promote them to fight censorship.
@_date: 2019-12-24 11:25:26
What a stupid decision.
I imagine that they had to leave a door open to allow the friends of the president to buy some in case ...
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:23:58
The media in general lack understanding on an incredible number of subjects.
They only want to make selling titles.
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:15:17
Excellent news for Bitcoin and its future.
@_date: 2019-12-24 11:25:55
Great idea!

Share your love for Bitcoin and continue to HODL in 2020 and beyond.
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:37:01
All of this is an important lesson showing why centralization is so bad.
YouTube allows itself to practice censorship and nobody can say anything.
Google does not respond because it has little to do with its contributors.
The best solution would be for all these YouTubers to decide to publish their videos on decentralized video platforms such as DTube.
These platforms are less lucrative because there are fewer users at the moment.
However, for them to gain popularity, one day we must begin to democratize them.
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:39:11
It's a certainty!
Bitcoin's margin of growth in the future is immense.
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:38:32
Yes, Youtube admits its error but in the end the centralized nature of the network shows its limits.
Anytime in the future, YouTube can do the same thing again.
The centralization of the platform gives them a very strong power of censorship.
YouTubers wishing to promote Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies should leave YouTube for decentralized platforms such as DTube.
@_date: 2019-12-25 07:34:05
Decentralized video sharing systems already exist, but unfortunately, they are struggling to gain popularity outside the circle of followers of cryptocurrencies.
YouTube has such an advantage that Google can afford censorship and completely dishonest practices.
@_date: 2019-12-15 08:52:28
Given his fortune, this does not represent much.
However, it is ultra positive because it makes Bitcoin talk in the media.

Great article. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2019-12-10 11:06:08
I like the idea defended by this illustration because for me, Bitcoin is a credible alternative to the flawed monetary and financial system that is currently in place.
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:28:42
Some seem to think this is good news for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry.
Personally, I do not know, I would wait to judge the acts.
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:12:37
Little by little, things continue to progress. The year 2020 will be grand for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:04:36
A very interesting study from Deutsche Bank, which highlights what we all know: cash money will disappear in the future.

Every time I heard that, the price of Bitcoin rose sharply a few weeks later.
So thank you Peter Mallouk.

It seems that the moment of truth has finally arrived for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-09-21 07:01:20
Not only the Bitcoin but the whole Internet should be worried.
@_date: 2018-07-16 09:45:29
Just HODL !!!
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:17:56
I also think so. The problem is that he will no longer be there to realize that he was wrong about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
