The real heroes are your local police and firemen.

I was secretly hoping I was the highest karma user to try that and would get loadsamoney. Ah well.
Sent the accept message. Woo.
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:09:15
Also: I now have two wallets. One I made and one I can't access that bitcointip made for me. Argh.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:31:36
Sure, I'm actually really interested in this now.
I did that redeem karma thing. What do you think I'll get for 128,000 karma? :)
And: How do I accept tips, and send that to paypal? I'm sure a user or two would want to give me a tip eventually. Might as well plan for it.
@_date: 2013-03-19 05:19:05
It means that is awesome.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:46:05
Awesome. :D
Also: Your bribes are working. I'm currently writing a feature in my handy-dandy notepad. I truly have no shame.
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:59:53
I was thinking something a bit sooner than that. Say, late March or so?
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:54:39
Money is only as good as what you can buy with it. So far I've yet to see any good way to turn bitcoin into objects I can enjoy without going through a dozen different websites in order to *maybe* put it in a PayPal account. Selling bitcoin to individuals gives no guarantee of me actually getting anything, making it a very unrealistic asset.
It's the future, but I won't be hopping on any bandwagons until it's secure. Security is the  priority in economics, as any econ major would tell you.
I hope to see it evolve.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:25:58
Oh wow, I can get bitcoins for my comment karma?
Finally, a reason for having 128,000 karma.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:27:09
I made an account at that website. Cool stuff.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:44:06
So long as I can send it to paypal I'll be ecstatic. I'm about to order parts for a computer and any amount would help me quite a bit.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:12:56
Contrary to popular belief, I do indeed accept bribes. Some call it dirty, I call it priority sorting.
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:08:23
Bitcoin can't buy me a new computer, though.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:36:45
That's awesome, but how do I use it? I've got this wallet on blockchain but nothing is showing up.
Sorry if I'm stupid, but, well, I'm stupid.

XavierMendel from Subreddit of the Day here.
Thanks for the nomination, I love seeing communities like this, and am especially generous toward those that make posts like this one in order to get community feedback.
It would be my pleasure to feature your subreddit on Though I don't know precisely *when* it will be due to scheduling issues it ought to be soon.
If you have any questions/comments/concerns, feel free to comment here or send me a PM.
@_date: 2013-03-19 08:59:23
Reminds me of a good quote by Jill Tarter. "The﻿ story of humans is the story of ideas, that shine light into dark corners."
Thanks. We do it all for you guys.
@_date: 2013-03-05 19:55:43
So, let's say I use coinbase. I make an account, send my bitcoin from the tip website to my account there, and it sends it to my bank?
This is beginning to be more confusing than real world money, but I can see why.
@_date: 2013-03-26 08:10:52
Not really. Being on SRotD allows for a community-wide celebration, something that brings everyone together for a day. It's no wonder some subreddits place it so highly.
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:25:22
Thanks a bunch. I'll watch that.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:15:25
Again, I don't know what to do with that.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:50:30
It's a bit different when you're retired like me, I guess. Not a whole lot of income means any amount extra is awesome.
I succeeded in life from hard work alone. Now that I'm done I might as well take the easy route.
@_date: 2013-03-19 05:36:21
No, but if it's good I'll take the credit anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-20 04:19:05
Thanks a bunch.
@_date: 2013-03-19 07:28:33


Few people know what we're about. SRotD doesn't affiliate itself with any other subreddits, nor does it spread their messages. We don't take necessarily take sides or anything. We just shine light on interesting places.

In the Dark Times, when time and space fought as children, PrincessChoadzilla wished for to be SRotD.
"I don't know what it is yet," they said, "but I know I want it."

@_date: 2013-03-19 07:23:15
Well, I can take credit for the last one, can pretend for the first, and I really don't care too much about Cyprus so I guess that's a necessary evil.
@_date: 2013-03-19 05:15:18
There's no such thing as coincidences. :)
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:02:04
One day I'll find a use for all this karma. One day...
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:12:23
I don't know what to do with that. I don't have any sort of bitcoin accounts.
