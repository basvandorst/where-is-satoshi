"Government-issued currencies have value because they represent human trust and cooperation." 
Me no think so.
"The harder-core pundits say “Even the US Federal Reserve is a bunch ‘a’ CROOKS, stealing your money via INFLATION, and that nasty Fiat Currency they issue is nothing but TOILET PAPER!!”
It’s all the same stuff that people say about Gold, which is also a totally irrational waste of human investment energy.
Government-issued currencies have value because they represent human trust and cooperation. There is no wealth and no trade without these two things, so you might as well go all-in and trust people. There are no financial instruments that will protect you from a world where we no longer trust each other."

&lt;To provide a more rigorous assessment of Bitcoin and illicit finance, the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance, a program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, teamed up with Elliptic, a cryptocurrency analysis provider, to study Bitcoin blockchain data and illicit inflows into digital currency services. This joint study provides insights for policymakers and financial industry leaders who want to better understand illicit finance risks arising from bitcoin and formulate ways to enhance Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance among cryptocurrency businesses.
This study aimed to identify where individuals turn in order to cash out or transmit bitcoins (BTC) acquired from illicit entities and to discover typologies for criminals “laundering” bitcoins. A true person-to-person payment using bitcoins will leave a record of that transaction and the addresses involved (analogous to account numbers) in the blockchain. This record can be an effective tool for law enforcement. Therefore, for the purpose of the study, we focus on those platforms and intermediaries that transmit funds on behalf of users by either cashing out bitcoins to a legal tender fiat currency, converting them to another cryptocurrency, or transmitting them to another Bitcoin address in such a way that the flow of funds cannot be viewed and traced directly on the blockchain. We call these platforms “conversion services” and they include virtual currency exchanges, mixers, online gambling sites that accept cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ATMs, and other services. &gt;

"The Council of the EU has . . . introduced a definition of “virtual currencies”.  . .The amendment sets out the following definition:
“virtual currencies” means a digital representation of value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority, is not necessarily attached to a legally established currency, and does not possess a legal status of currency or money, but is accepted by natural or legal persons, as a means of exchange, and which can be transferred, stored and traded electronically.
The amendment makes it explicitly clear in the preamble that virtual currencies should not to be confused with electronic money (Article 2(2) of Directive 2009/110/EC) nor with the term funds (meaning banknotes and coins, scriptural money or electronic money, point (25) of Article 4 of Directive 2015/2366/EU). The legislator made it equally clear that virtual currencies are not in-games currencies, which can be used exclusively within the specific game environment.
What is interesting to me is that the preamble also makes it clear that virtual currencies may also be used for other different purposes and find broader applications such as “means of exchange, investment purposes, store-of-value products or uses in online casinos.”
If we now try to analyse the content of the definition, we would break it down in the following:
a) digital representation of value — A lot of experts in finance, including some Nobel award winners, are discussing the value of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. This part can be argued two ways — one is that every token on the blockchain represents some value. Blockchain is a value driven system where nothing happens without fuel. In practice, every token represents some value, monetary or functional. It will be very difficult to argue that there is a token, which value is zero. The other way is that this digital representation of value needs to be direct — namely that the value of token is directly evident (but not linked) in EUR or linked to a known scope and type of service.
b) not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority — For this element all tokens, known to me, match. Let’s wait and see what Estonia does.
c) not necessarily attached to a legally established currency — In its essence, no tokens are attached to a legally established currency as of today. It is true that for the most popular and biggest ones there is a direct trading pair either in EUR or USD, but this should not be considered as “being attached”. Project Tether (and similar ones) was however different. Legally wise, this element is somehow irrelevant — it says that a token either is or is not attached to a currency and that does not have effect on whether such token is a virtual currency or not.
d) does not possess a legal status of currency or money — This criterion is met with all known tokens as of today. No tokens, to my knowledge, possess such status.
e) is accepted by natural or legal persons, as a means of exchange — Again, it will be hard to argue that any token is not means of exchange. They are designed to be exchangeable and this is their main feature. In practice, it might happen that some tokens will not be accepted by anyone (for some reason), but such perhaps only temporary condition, might not be enough to exempt a particular token from the virtual currency definition.
f) can be transferred, stored and traded electronically — Tokens are by design transferable, storable and tradable. There might be certain rare exceptions to this, but in principle all tokens match this criterion.
In other words — it seems that most of the tokens known and existing today may fall within the “virtual currency” definition. This could not be an error in the concept or a mere coincidence, the EU must have wanted to design a definition, which would cover as many tokens as possible. This is also evident from the preamble, which clearly reads that “The objective of this Directive is to cover all the potential uses of virtual currencies.”
This makes the EU the first “country” in the world (to my knowledge, but please feel free to correct me), which introduced a clear and legally binding definition of anything on blockchain.
The issue, however, might occur that the definition is too wide and that practically all cryptographic tokens will for the purpose of EU law be considered as virtual currencies. Is this really what the commission wanted and is this beneficial to the industry? As long as only the gateways to fiat are subject to AML regulation, such definition is probably not an issue. But most likely is that in addition to virtual currency definition, we might also need a definition of cryptographic token. In any case, legislators should be careful with using this definition of virtual currencies, because it seems it covers practically all blockchain tokens.
Which Services Classify as “Exchanges”? The amendment extends the scope of AML directive also to cover “providers engaged in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies.”
Again, the preamble gives us some insight into the rationale behind the provisions. It is said that fiat currencies are coins, banknotes and electronic money of a country that is designated as a legal tender and is accepted as a medium of exchange in the issuing country. The Commission is of view that exchange services poses a risk of money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and consequently competent authorities should be able to monitor through obliged entities the use of virtual currencies.
Interestingly, the preamble explicitly reads that a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without these providers.
My understanding consequently is that exchange of virtual currencies between entities is not governed by the AML directive as long as such activity is not a service. In other words, if entities A and B agree on exchange of 10 BTC for EUR and execute a transaction, this is not a service of exchange and such entities are not bound by the AML regulation. When A starts offering such transaction to consumers as a service, then it without doubt presents exchange service.
It seems that exchanges, providing only exchange of crypto to crypto, will remain free of compliance requirements under the AML directive.
Which Services Classify as “custodian wallet providers”? The amendment provides that:
“custodian wallet provider” means an entity that provides services to safeguard private cryptographic keys on behalf of their customers, to hold, store and transfer virtual currencies.
I am a lawyer and I do not want to get too technical in this paper, but to my understanding as long as I hold the private key to the wallet, and none of third party providers also hold it, then such situation is out of scope of the AML Regulation. But when a third-party entity holds the private key to a blockchain wallet, where my funds (or better said — funds, not owned by such third-party provider) are stored, then such situation is regulated by the AML regulation.
This means that using MyEtherWallet (or Ledger Nano S, Trezor, Jaxx, Mist) to open a wallet on a blockchain network does not fall under the AML regulation. But using Bitwala (or Coinbase), which store the private key (even though they might share it with the users) would be regulated.
It seems that there are two main elements: 1) the private key to the wallet is (also or exclusively) held by the wallet provider, and 2) the funds in the wallet belong to the user and not the wallet provider. If these two elements are met, then the service provider is regulated by the AML regulation.
What Does This Mean for Exchanges and Wallet Providers? Quite a lot. In practice, they need to comply with all provisions of the AML directive, or with the pertaining regulation of their country of incorporation."

Perhaps not the volatility of Bitcoin, and alternatives, but Central Bank controllers of the USD and other major government sanctioned currencies consciously debase them over time. For example, the U.S. Central Bank has a 2 percent per annum USD inflation target (of which higher inflation rates have been discussed).

This is pretty much a tried-proven method to regulate, co-opt.  It is now being tried with Bitcoin, crypto, DL.
"European governments are pushing for bitcoin regulation amid mounting alarm that the world’s most popular digital currency is being used by money-launderers, drug traffickers and terrorists.
“I don’t like it; it can hide activities such as drug trafficking and terrorism,” Le Maire said on LCI television, adding that he also had concerns for savers. “There is an obvious speculative risk, we need to look at it, study it,” he said.
France is not alone in seeking to regulate a currency which is stepping further into the mainstream financial world. Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan would be ready to discuss Le Maire’s proposal, according to the official in Rome, who said that the ministry had yet to receive any request from Paris.EU lawmakers and representatives of the member states agreed on a revision of the bloc’s anti-money laundering rules Friday, extending the framework to firms that “are in charge of holding, storing and transferring virtual currencies,” according to a statement from the European Commission. These companies “will have to identify their customers and report any suspicious activity.”
Two Nobel economics laureates denounced Bitcoin last month. Joseph Stiglitz said it should be outlawed, and doesn’t serve “any socially-useful function.” Robert J. Shiller said the attraction of the currency was a narrative akin to a “mystery movie” that draws in people who want to outsmart the system."

I agree with OP. I posted this not long ago: "Coinbase likely operates on a fractional reserve basis, meaning they can only return a limited portion of deposits-holdings at any one time.

When one sees the percentage price upticks, downticks in the ICO market tokens, it is a no brainer that the 'securities industry' regulators will seek to regulate.

It totally is at odds with the original spirit of Bitcoin and the crypto space.

We now live essentially in a socialist military-industrial-Medical-Education complex that requires gigantic budgets.  As such they run deficits, State Treasuries issue bonds, central banks in effect create new money of which it goes 'somewhere.'  The QE first begun by the U.S. Central Bank, picked up on by the EU, others injected trillions that a significant amount has gone into financial assets, rather than economically productive undertakings.  This can be done when rates are near the lower zero bound. Yes, Keynes likely did not have in mind what is going on now, but had he reviewed history he would have known that when political actors gain the keys to the kingdom of overseeing money, down the line they have abused this privilege. 
It is no different today, and hence why alts. like Bitcoin have gain traction.

A lot wrong, or puffery in the article (though a few good points too), I will focus on the hype:


--So this writer thinks Bitcoin/cryptos will get away with, be allowed to do what Gov Fiats are no longer able to do?
I doubt it.  


--Often not instant, and majors like Coinbase require a fair amount of KYC info.


--Maybe, but not 100 percent, even for a pro.  Also, in that the blockchain entry is permanent, if-when the party is identified may make it iron-clad when the the authoritah's come a calling.


--Baloney. We hear horror stories of days and weeks through exchanges.  Most are not doing direct transfers due to not knowing how, or complexity.


--Current fees might make sense for large transfers, but do not at present make sense for small-micro transfers. 


--Not happening yet, may happen down the road, so this is baloney. 


--Undervalued? Bitcoin is going up, because present buyers are hoping it goes up more.  Bitcoin is a Speculation and will continue to be so in 2018 "The Year of Bitcoin" It may increase in price (in terms of gov. fiat), but as they say, buyer beware.

Next up is paying to keep you fun bucks in an account vs. being paid something, AKA as NIRP. Interestingly, they need digital monies, vs. ability to withdraw physical, under the theory they can better control digital vs. ability to stuff physical in a mattress avoiding NIRP. 
As for Keynes, that is likely all that most are exposed to anymore, however, my advice would be to take a look at competing economic theories, and also why Keynes came up with what he did (hint, it was in the UK interest at that point in time).

Well, no one ever said govt. policy/law imposition is sane, but it has evolved to what it is (not my wish, nor choice).
Since much of this is new, including tax accounting, you can only do the best you are able, and may well end up okay.  But again, do what you are doing and seek out advice from various sources, then reach conclusions you feel comfortable with. 
This item ran on coindesk at Sept 2017, you can do a search and find the full article (or other about the $600 exemption, which indeed is not much, and unless in new tax legislation, may not yet be in the tax code). 
"US Lawmakers Seek Tax Exemption for Bitcoin Transactions Below $600
Sep 7, 2017 Two members of the US House of Representatives have filed a bill seeking to create a tax exemption for purchases made with cryptocurrencies. Back in 2014, the Internal Revenue Service declared that it would consider bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as a kind of property for tax purposes. Any profits made when selling or exchanging a cryptocurrency triggers a capital gains requirement. Yet due to the wording of the IRS decision, that covers any transaction involving bitcoin, including an oft-mentioned purchase of a cup of coffee – essentially meaning that if you bought some bitcoin at $1, and spent it on a $2 cup of coffee, you would owe tax on the difference. Reps. Jared Polis and David Schweikert, who co-lead the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, are hoping to alleviate some of the issues resulting from that ruling with the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act.Unveiled today, the measure, if passed, would create a de minimis exemption for cryptocurrency payments below $600 after December 31 of this year. Put more simply, transactions involving a cryptocurrency below that threshold wouldn't trigger a capital gains liability. As the text of the bill states: "Gross income shall not include gain from the sale or exchange of virtual currency for 5 other than cash or cash equivalents….[if the amount of gain excluded from gross income under subsection (a) with respect to a sale or exchange shall not exceed $600."

So this gets into the qausi Ponzi (or maybe fractional) aspect of exchanges. They likely never are at near 100 percent on ability to pay out, in particular as you point out when for the most part the BTC price is rising. They would likely need to have new Fiat coming in near the BTC exchange rate to service BTC transaction sells, as they would have taken in a lesser amount of Fiat when the price was lower. In the case of exchanges like Coinbase that claim to have FDIC backing for the USD holdings, this indicates a formal banking relationship.  Is Coinbase using funds from various user accounts that hold USD with the bank uses to payout on BTC to USD transactions?
What if a lot of BTC sell transaction orders hit, how much reserves would be available to payout in USD fiat?
Could be this is the problem with Bitstamp, and other exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:57:19
Coinbase likely operates on a fractional reserve basis, meaning they can only return a limited portion of deposits-holdings at any one time.
If too many seek to leave or cash out, sort of like a bank run, they might become insolvent.
I believe they claim their USD holdings have govt. insurance, but likely not so for BTC and other supposed holdings.

Select coastal regions, a few other locales (in U.S.), have enjoyed above average wages compared to many other places.  But, as you point out with the numbers you provide, one must likely have a very good paying job to subsist.  These areas still require service workers, who may make what for some regions would be considered good pay, but in the locales you cite are not adequate.
It is my belief that what we have come to know as money is far removed from assets, wage earnings, etc., which ultimately falls back to the privilege granted gov's./CB's to oversee said systems.
The Crypto's and other assets are simply a pushback, however, the status quo now begins to enter the space, so let us see what transpires over the next year or so.

Depends on the crypto currency. My understanding is some can and will be inflationary. Bitcoin was touted as a fixed issue of something like 21 million, and to be non-inflationary.  It remains to be seen if that will stay in place.  The CME/CBOE trading adds a new wrinkle, though since USD, not sure of the impact. ETF's are up next, which are supposed to hold the underlying asset.  Perhaps because Bitcoin is on a ledger this will be verifiable, if not then perhaps rehypothecation, derivatives, etc. could occur which could impact pricing.

As Blockchain is now configured, only select robust hosting apparatus can handle it(read Amazon, Google, etc.), which of course ditches the whole idea of decentralization.  Unless this is overcome, it kills the original concept!

TPTB want digital payment systems/money vs. cash. They now see efforts like bitcoin as a free method to get there. They will either take over bitcoin, or simply mandate whatever they (and TPTB) decide upon be used under severe penalty, and it will be.  
And IMO bitcoin cannot thwart any of this due to the transactions always being on the blockchain, and the masses going through strictly regulated exchanges (they will not bother with coinjoin, multiple throwaway wallets, etc.; same as they did not bother with anonymous mail servers, and other Internet tools to maintain privacy).
So there you have it, TPTB thank you for all the free work you are doing!

Much attention from the public happens when assets see rapid price increases, which can lead to more of the same.
Problem is, if the price stagnates, or begins to mildly drop, a lot of the Johnny-Jill come lately's start exiting, and the stampede stops, or goes in the opposite direction.
It appears this is what went down with Bitcoin in 2017, with reversal beginning in early 2018.
Whether more rocket ship rides up will happen, is anyone's guess, though with more of the public knowing about it, and not so new, may be harder for them to happen, as has happened in the past.

In that you are not a formal agent, you may be on the hook on the tax situation. Depends on how much gain, which party might enjoy a lower tax hit. If LT cap gains, seems that would be the same for you or her. Suppose you could just pay the tax, and have grandma reimburse.

Forking is like numerous Linux distributions, it leads to confusion and winds up not going mainstream.

If do not have to exchange anything, seems like a transfer would not be a taxable event.  Cashing out, then you figure orig. cost basis selling price difference, and any gain/loss for tax purposes. Original buy(buys) held less than a year before selling, normally a ST gain, typically taxed at personal tax rate.  If held over a year LT gain, typically at lower rate.
But find a tax person that is totally up on all of this to get best advice, as I think the tax authorities are having a hard time dealing with it as well.

A good read is a pamphlet by the late Murray Rothbard called What Has Government Done To Our Money. The discussion of private money reminds me of what is going on with the crypto systems vs. state sanctioned. 
The apple cart has been very upset, and because of international nature of crypto they are trying to figure out what to do to get it under control, or co-opt.

Income tax came about in 1913. In the beginning, .Gov took little, and was mostly from high earners. During WWII it was presented as patriotic to pay taxes, and the masses bought off on it (payroll deduction was also put in place vs. paying annually).  Today, it is just normal to do so, and no one questions it (as evidenced by the postings one regularly sees in this and other forums). Beyond direct taxes on income, increasingly a plethora of taxes and 'fees' are larded onto utility bills, property tax bills, insurance bills, in particular services that govt. has a monopoly over, or by law one must have.  The control the Central Bank took over the USD money supply at Dec. 23, 2013 and copied by other in place Central Banks enables another 'hidden tax,' the tax of inflation (that again, I see so many on message outlets such as this saying is wonderful).

They may allow many cryptos to be payable for taxes, but will in the end have to be converted to legal tender fiat, so this does not mean Bitcoin is near to being an accepted currency, simply a payment method that will be converted.
'Government' controls the present money systems through legal tender laws, mandated payment of taxes, other means.  They wish this to continue, so yes it has everything to do with Bitcoin and other cryptos becoming an 'accepted currency' versus simply a medium of exchange into present accepted currencies.
Why should anyone need to undertake 'political activity' to sort any of this out?
Perhaps the State, Government, those that control monetary systems, taxing authorities have grown a bit big for their britches?

What both the massive runups and now drops (equity markets) point out is pricing has little to do with fundamentals, reality. 
It is about computerized trading, and 'investor sentiment.'
Do you prefer managed, manipulated markets by the likes of Central Banks, regulatory authorities, or more honest markets with fundamentals, price discovery?
Sadly, history shows the masses prefer the illusion of managed markets, and those able to benefit from the illusion are more than willing to accommodate.

The IRS has an informational page on 1099-K
Do a search and you will find it. Including some text from it. A big question is whether the activity merited Coinbase and other exchanges issuing 1099-K's or if they just did it. 
"Understanding Your Form 1099-K"
Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions, is an IRS information return used to report certain payment transactions to improve voluntary tax compliance.  You should receive Form 1099-K by January 31st if, in the prior calendar year, you received payments:
•from payment card transactions (e.g., debit, credit or stored-value cards), and/or
•in settlement of third-party payment network transactions above the minimum reporting thresholds of – ◦gross payments that exceed $20,000, AND
◦more than 200 such transactions
What does my Form 1099-K report to me?
A Form 1099-K includes the gross amount of all reportable payment transactions.  You will receive a Form 1099-K from each payment settlement entity from which you received payments in settlement of reportable payment transactions.  A reportable payment transaction is defined as a payment card transaction or a third party network transaction.
•Payment card transaction means any transaction in which a payment card, or any account number or other identifying data associated with a payment card, is accepted as payment.  
•Third party network transaction means any transaction that is settled through a third party payment network, but only after the total amount of such transactions exceeds $20,000 and the aggregate number of such transactions exceeds 200.
The gross amount of a reportable payment does not include any adjustments for credits, cash equivalents, discount amounts, fees, refunded amounts or any other amounts. The dollar amount of each transaction is determined on the date of the transaction.
NOTE: The minimum reporting thresholds of greater than $20,000 and more than 200 transactions apply only to payments settled through a third-party network; there is no threshold for payment card transactions.
What should I do with this information?
It is important that your business books and records reflect your business income, including any amounts that may be reported on Form 1099-K. You must report on your income tax return all income you receive from your business. In most cases, your business income will be in the form of cash, checks, and debit/credit card payments. Business income is generally referred to as gross receipts on income tax returns. Therefore, you should consider the amounts shown on Form 1099-K, along with all other amounts received, when calculating gross receipts for your income tax return.
In addition --
•Check your payment card receipt records and merchant statements to confirm that the amount on your Form 1099-K is accurate
•Review your records to ensure your gross receipts are accurate and reported correctly on your income tax return
•Determine whether you have reported income from all forms of payment received, including cash, checks, and debit, credit and stored-value card transactions.
•Maintain documentation to support both the income and deductions you report on your income tax return"

I am a bit puzzled as to why a commercial business would utilize a "Foundation" structure.  I also found it odd that the Bitcoin Foundation utilized "Foundation" as well. I used to think of "Foundations" as primarily philanthropic entities not for businesses, or trade associations.  Is this for tax purposes; a marketing tool? I was under the impression that individuals directing Bitcoin to Factom may expect a future return on investment, or maybe not, so is Factom a startup business, or instead a philanthropic undertaking (where people just contributed Bitcoin with no expectation of return), or what?

"Bitcoin earners handle their digital paychecks in different ways. One method is the "immediate cash-out," practiced by Lindsay Holland, assistant director of the Bitcoin Foundation. Like all the foundation's employees, Holland receives her entire salary in the currency. "I hold a certain percent of my bitcoin and sell the rest. I try to do that on a regular basis," Holland said.
The portion she holds is part of her investment portfolio. Regular cash-outs help protect Holland's spending money from fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, while the part that she saves gives her the opportunity to benefit from the long-term growth in value that enthusiasts hope to see.

“That is Financial Fairness”
Although this technically may be true, the reality may be different at some juncture. Gold is a reasonably finite product, yet the financial Shamans have found a way to lease it, rehypothecate it, of which financial products like gold ETFs have been enablers. Same may be the case with some Stocks (equities). How do we know the title to the same stock is not sold to multiple interests either directly or through financial sleight of hand? What about Derivatives? 
So the point is, why cannot the same occur with Bitcoin, even if a finite issue? With new Bitcoin financial products in the works, I see zero reason this will not happen with Bitcoin.

COLAs are typically based on a formula, and a set amount. Very different than a wage increase, which in some cases may be formulaic, but in many instances is not (and is not called a COLA).
To state that "the middle class generally get COLA" without qualifying what you mean is absurd. 
Again, you really do not know what you are talking about, that much is very clear. 
The following ties to one class of government payment that receives potential COLA increases, it is illustrative. It has nothing to do with wage increases, or "the middle class," though it might affect a portion of said class, but again a different animal than what you present. 
"History of Automatic Cost-Of-Living Adjustments (COLA) 
The purpose of the COLA is to ensure that the purchasing power of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits is not eroded by inflation. It is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) from the third quarter of the last year a COLA was determined to the third quarter of the current year. If there is no increase, there can be no COLA.
The CPI-W is determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor. By law, it is the official measure used by the Social Security Administration to calculate COLAs."
