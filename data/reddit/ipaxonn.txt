I was thinking about this today. Some people have said two weeks, others have compared it to the crash back in April and speculated two months, it's really hard tellin not knowin
Bitcoin is very new and we are in uncharted territory. The market could crash tomorrow, or it could keep climbing for an extended period of time.
I'm betting that there is going to be a crash, but I don't know when or how big it will be. All I know is that when it happens, I'll be buying. I have a lot of faith in bitcoin.

Honestly? I don't really know. I think that for right now my plan is to wait and see how low it gets. When it seems to slowly start ticking back up again, I may buy in. Something with such volatile ups and downs like bitcoin is rather stressful for me, so I prefer to be cautious.

Coinbase is something of an online wallet that lets you buy bitcoins directly from your bank account. In order to get started you need to link a bank account. As far as I can tell, coinbase decides what the price of a bitcoin is (which is probably why it's so damn high). Coinbase does not keep your money on its site, and works through ACH transfers. The purchase-to-delivery time is lengthy, but when you buy, coinbase locks into the price of the bitcoin at the time of ordering (so if you bought a bitcoin when they were $210 and the price jumps up to $220, you still only have to pay $210)
When you sell your coins, the money is transferred directly to your bank account within 2-3 business days.
Bitstamp is an exchange, and people determine how much they want to pay or charge for bitcoin. As a result, prices are competitive. In order to buy on bitstamp, you first deposit money into your account and then purchase the coins. When you sell your coins, the money remains in your bitstamp account and you have to withdraw it into your bank account.
In order to sell/buy on BitStamp, you must verify your identity, which involves uploading a copy of a Photo ID and a Document showing proof of residence. For those in the U.S, I /think/ the only way to deposit and withdraw money is through a wire transfer, but I could be wrong. 
As for why one website can afford to charge higher commissions, it's not that they can 'afford' it, it's because that's how they make their money.
That's all I know. Hopefully it helps!

I've cashed out already. Maybe I'm just incredibly risk averse, but things were moving too fast for me to be comfortable with it. Bitcoin was valued at an average of $217 just last /week/. My gut tells me this momentum can't be maintained.

Fees, man. All the goddamn fees

I'm not really sure, because withdrawing through wire transfer requires a fee as well, and those are a buttmunch.

I breathed a lot easier after getting it out, too :)
