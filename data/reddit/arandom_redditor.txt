Only that it wasn't "suggested" where others were.

Thanks for the info. I'll review my options and try to make the best decision. Very much appreciated.

I see, thank you. I really only chose Jaxx because it was right there on the play store and the reviews weren't "horrible".
I live in a Windows and Android ecosystem and would prefer something that runs on either of those. I do like the convenience of being able to veiw my balance easily from an app on my phone.
The reason I'm looking at Trezor is just that I don't see myself really spending my BTC at this point and it seems more secure than simply an app on my phone or on my PC.
I'm nowhere near having hundreds of dollars worth of BTC at this time but in a year's time or more it may be more likely.

Thank you. I'm trying to keep things simple. Thinking of the Android SW wallet as you would a wallet in your back pocket and the Trezor more as a bank/safe deposit box.
I just don't see myself spending out of the SW wallet so I'm not sure I even need it if the HW wallet is easy enough to use/manage.
However I like the convenience of having a balance I can view from my phone without needing to fire up a PC and connect the HW wallet in order to review things.
I haven't thoroughly exploered the re covery process for Jaxx or any other wallet yet. So I'll definitely review that. And even test it.
Do you happen to know if a SW wallet on IOS or Android would simply come back to life with all data intact upon restoring the entire phone from a backup?
Or is it always a case of having to reimport the private keys (take that description with a grain of salt as I'm not clear on the process yet)
