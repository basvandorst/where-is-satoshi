Ah bummer. It was my only exchange had a verified account.
Are there any newer exchanges that accept bank deposits without having your account verified?

I think theyre going to stop allowing credit purchases soon though

Discover hasn't allowed crypto purchases for a while now. And I think the question is phrased fine? Visa and Mastercard are payment networks. What matters is if the banks issuing credit cards on their networks allow crypto purchases or not...which is what I'm asking about.


...visa isn't the one who has been saying no, it's the banks denying to lend you their money to buy crypto.

I know the feeling. I've gambled away what would become a similar equivalent worth of bitcoin.

How is it silly to consider that his investments over his life have biased his opinion as to what is a good investment?

Nah, the mistake was thinking the developed world would ever want or need cryptocurrency. It's the people of developing worlds which, as they come more and more online, have the greatest chance of actually implementing a new kind of banking system.

You can use localbitcoins and meet up with someone in a in person, use cash, and have bitcoin in your wallet in a matter of hours. ...though yes, this requires pants.
