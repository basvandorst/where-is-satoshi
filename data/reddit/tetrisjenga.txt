Right? We actually ended up in this carpark by accident and couldn't believe how cheap it was, just as close to the beach than the main carpark too.

You had to go into the cafe to pay, so I'd assume it was in there.

2012. Highly doubt it wouldve only been that little.

I kinda agree and I did think that myself when I saw it. I just thought it was cool that a little carpark at the beach was accepting bitcoin.

My girlfriend lives down this way so it was my first time around Plymstock and the beach, really nice area. Ahh I didn't know the cafe was for sale, I do know it does an amazing sausage and bacon bap though.

For some reason the first half of my message got cut off. It was back in 2012 so even a couple BTC wouldnt have meant too much to him at the time.

FYI, you can buy bitcoins in fractions, meaning you can buy as small as 0.001 BTC ($10ish)

Bitcoin mining is practically obsolete for average consumers now so you would have to actually buy bitcoin (you can buy fractions of it so you don't have to invest 10,000 dollars). The  sidebar on this subreddit is a good way to get informed.

Nope, when you first create a wallet you will be given a mnemonic code of I believe 16 words that you write down on a piece of paper. In the case that you break your pc you can simply redownload the program again and input the code to get your wallet back

You can buy and sell fractions of Bitcoins. Those with 1 bitcoin doesn't need to sell the whole thing in one go, and if they wanted to they could do so through an exchange anyway.

Yep, thousands a day. Not only that but you can trade in fractions of a bitcoin meaning you don't have to sell the whole thing in one go

Hey I know you're probably not too interested but the sidebar on this subreddit has some resources to help you understand what Bitcoin is and what it stands for. It's not as confusing as it seems.

There's no one behind a computer controlling the numbers, there is no way to be scammed, minus an exchange taking your money but you shouldn't keep your bitcoins there anyway

No one in their right mind was expecting 10k in November 2017 a year ago, it wouldnt be crazy at this point to think it could hit 50k before this time next year.

Everyone here knows it will crash at some point in the future, it's common sense. The downvotes come from you saying you'll take pleasure in people losing money

Damn I don't get money for a couple more days.
