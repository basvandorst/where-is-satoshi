I'd suggest writing it all down in a password protected document, kept in a safe location that your wife, or other trusted individuals would be able to access in the event of an emergency. Be as detailed as possible about logins, how to transfer, restore seeds--it's all for nothing if loved ones cannot live comfortably if something ever happens to you.

If it's utterly life-changing and means you can live a life of comfort and financial freedom, you ought to be taking *some* profit. There's no guarantee about today, tmrw, or even 5-10 years from now; who knows if you or your family would even be alive to enjoy it? 
It doesn't mean you have to sell them all, just at least secure some gains so that you can live in peace with whatever may happen next, rise or fall.
