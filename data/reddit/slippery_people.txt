The Alex Jones situation doesn't implicate the First Amendment, but the Supreme Court has definitely ruled that advocating violence or threatening violence can constitute protected political speech. 
In *[Brandenburg v. Ohio]( the Supreme Court ruled that advocating violence is protected under the First Amendment (except if the call for violence is "directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action" — which would necessarily entail some type of riot situation).
In *[Watts v. United States]( the Supreme Court reversed the conviction of man who threatened the president, by saying (in the context of the Vietnam draft) "If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.") — because it was not a "true threat" but rather a caustic form of political speech. And that's why Alex Jones won't be arrested.

It's not legally irrelevant because the judge made a specific finding that the evidence demonstrated that Ross commissioned and paid for five murders and enhanced his sentence on that basis.
Totally cold-blooded. Three of the people who Ross ordered executed were just people who happened to be in the same location as Ross's primary target. He had no idea who they were, but he paid for them to be killed because they were in the way. Ross transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars and received a photo of the murder scene containing random numbers that he provided for authentication.
