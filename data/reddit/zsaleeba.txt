The part that amazes me here is that there are so many people here saying "take the haircut". It seems pretty clear that their proposal is illegal. Specific people's funds were stolen. Now they're trying to bully the rest of their unaffected customers into covering other people's loss with absolutely no legal basis for doing so.
It's very convenient for them since it's their only hope of avoiding bankruptcy. But honestly a company that screws up so comprehensively really needs to go bankrupt. They should not be allowed to go on taking people's money.

This seems like a smart move. As bitcoin gets mined out it's going to become more and more important to give incentive to miners and others providing the infrastructure. A free market like this should be self-balancing and will set the transaction cost at fair levels.

The definition of fiat currency is one which derives its value from government or law. Bitcoin does not derive its value from government or law and that's why it's not a fiat currency.
The core bitcoin protocol doesn't currently have any known opportunities for serious attack or it would already have been attacked. Minor issues are being improved all the time so it will become even more solid as time passes.

The mining is necessary to help secure the bitcoin network. The more people mining the harder it is for someone to try to put false transactions on the blockchain.

It's less susceptible to manipulation than fiat currencies and it has by far the greatest capitalisation of any cryptocurrency so it's relatively immune to attack due to sheer weight of numbers.

Any malicious app could tell your SIM card to approve a transaction transferring all your bitcoin to someone else. Unless the SIM card has a separate display and buttons to verify the transaction with you the idea is unfortunately only as secure as your android device, and that's not very secure.

What's your plan for getting traction with the electorate given that you have no policies? Surely people will be sceptical of a party with no policies?
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:28:07
You're misunderstanding me. I don't mean the wallet software, I mean the actual wallets. If people continue to use their old wallets then there's no space advantage. It's only when they create a new Segwit format wallet that their transactions will move into the new space. We can't expect everyone to do that on day 1 so it'll probably be a slow process to getting the block size advantage.
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:55:29
What will your party's platform and policies be?
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:48:35
It's really not. It's only 2MB when/if all users change to new Segwit format wallets. That could take a long time. It's definitely not "right now".

Segwit's an ok answer to a pretty specific question. The reason it's not universally popular is that is that it doesn't solve the really pressing problems that people are desperate to get solved right now - expensive transactions and a big backlog. The fact that Core is flat out refusing to fix these serious problems is causing them big reputational damage.
Some people think Segwit will fix these problems but from a technical point of view it doesn't appear to even attempt to do that. It fixes some other less important issues and it doesn't look like it'll do much to ease our immediate problems at all. The small, one off effective block size increase will be very slow to take effect so it's not really much help at all.
That's why miners aren't signalling for Segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:56:39
The capacity increase isn't realised until users create a new Segwit format walllet and transfer their bitcoin to it. We can't expect everyone to do this on day one so it'll be a gradual process for the capacity benefits to be achieved.
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:36:21


Currently control of the block size is centralised with Core, isn't it? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 02:17:46
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:16:42
It provides a high degree of privacy. Transactions are essentially untraceable and at the same time a huge amount of space is saved on the blockchain making transactions cheaper for everyone.
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:48:26
There's no inherent immediate space increase - Segwit's space advantages aren't realised until users change their existing bitcoin wallets over to being new Segwit format wallets. That'll be a gradual process and it's not really clear how quickly it'll happen or what proportion of people will change over. If everyone gets on board really quickly there could be around a 2X increase depending on the transaction mix.

All of those options sound pretty good really, at least in general terms.

That's not how BU works. The maximum block size is consensus-based, not simply removed.
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:02:22
As well as solving the malleability issue for all cases (and not just the one case that Segwit handles) it also introduces an improved transaction format which makes future improvements to Bitcoin much easier.
In terms of complexity it's literally a tiny fraction of the size of Segwit so it's a lot easier to audit for security and bugs. It's a whole lot less "technical debt" meaning that future maintainability will be significantly easier forever.
@_date: 2016-03-17 09:54:38
Honestly I wish we were even half that interesting in reality.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:08:47
They really do fundamentally different things. Segwit is primarily designed to fix a malleability issue in preparation for some future technologies (but also has a one-time slow acting bump in effective block size). BU is a scaling solution which uses consensus to ensure that congestion is solved permanently.
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:58:09
Let me paraphrase that article: "gun crime decreased and violent crime decreased as well but we're still going to call it a failure".
The simple fact is that you're [21 times more liked to be murdered]( with a gun in the US than you are in Australia. Personally, being shot to death isn't something I'm looking for so I really like that people don't have guns in Australia.

Lightning network can be implemented separately from Segwit if necessary. It can already work without Segwit but some sub-projects benefit from Segwit. If Segwit fails lightning network could use other infrastructure instead - there are various possibilities including Flexible Transactions etc.. It'll require some significant rework for some of those projects but it's do-able.

Satoshi originally said that block sizes would be very large. Then when there were spam attacks he added a temporary limit which he said should be adjusted upward later as the blocks started to fill. That's exactly what Bitcoin cash is doing.

No-one wants this. He was just saying that if the consensus wants it to change it can be changed.

Note: this is a retrospective vulnerability disclosure. This issue was already fixed in release 1.0.0 of Bitcoin Unlimited.
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:45:54
In the short to medium term Lightning Network transactions end up being resolved on the blockchain so for it to scale it still requires the blockchain to scale well beyond its current level. Even if Lightning Network was implemented tomorrow it wouldn't solve our current scaling problems because today's transaction endpoints will still be on the blockchain.

"Shouldn't" doesn't really come into it. The way the system works it **is** up to the miners. That's just the way the system is designed and it can't really be changed.
@_date: 2017-01-26 23:07:52
It is possible. [Here's]( a post with a good description.
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:45:19
Segwit is not a scaling solution. It only offers a one-time step, and only when users change to Segwit wallets. That will probably be a very gradual process - it'll probably take years for everyone to change wallets. Meanwhile we need &gt;1MB blocks urgently and we'll be needing &gt;2MB blocks within a couple of years. Segwit doesn't offer any solution for either of these scaling problems.
@_date: 2017-01-29 01:54:20
If the great majority of miners decide to increase the block size then it will increase and there's nothing we can do about it. They don't have this power because we decided they could, nor because it's necessarily what we want. They have the power simply because it's "Nakamoto consensus" and that is fundamentally how the system works.
Sure, it's possible for there to be a mass uprising against the miners as you suggest but bitcoin would basically be dead before the fallout settled - everyone would decamp for an alt coin rather than deal with the losses they'd incur in the process.
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:13:45
Lightning Network was developed before Segwit and so it was originally designed to work without needing Segwit at all. It's really as simple as that. Some of the more recently added features of Lightning can get benefit from Segwit though.
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:52:41
I'm interested to hear what you think the alternative is.
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:18:45
Lightning Network can operate without Segwit so there's no need to wait. Some parts of Lightning benefit from Segwit but it's not a hard prerequisite.
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:19:53
The thread you linked to says exactly the same thing as the article you say it refutes - that LN can be implemented now but with Segwit (or something like it) there are a variety of advantages.

Like it or not the design of bitcoin is such that in the end the miners do determine the implementation. For instance if one miner was to say "I'm just going to change the 1MB block size constant to 2MB" and if &gt;50% of the other miners agreed and did the same then it would just happen. This is called "Nakamoto consensus" and it's a fundamental attribute of how bitcoin works. No-one can change that.

He always intended that the blockchain would expand to [large capacity](


would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.




sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:23:25
The market would set the value of a transaction in a natural way as miners competed with each other for the available fees. The market that we currently have is an artificial market where it's constrained so users compete for the limited number of available transactions, pushing fees up.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:31:50
Because it wouldn't be worth your while in the long run. Mining costs money and if you take transactions which undervalue your contribution to securing the network you're forcing prices down and will eventually contribute to bankrupting yourself. It's an indirect effect rather than a direct effect and different miners will choose to set their policy differently but in the end if they all choose to accept tiny fees then they all go bankrupt.
