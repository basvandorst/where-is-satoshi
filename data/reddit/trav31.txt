Hopefully the market is in the hands of ruthless professionals who will define the price and shake all the hope out of suckers. This way Bitcoin can start being used properly

people won't switch to thick clients  (installable apps)  from web. 
Websites are there for a reason

I retweeted this seven times but the price hasn't gone up. Is there anything else I can do to help community?

if you want to see the revolution in action, check trade volumes on binance.com - [over $500m daily ](
Everything in due time. Fiat is not easier, but few people are using crypto. As for me, i work for crypto for several years, and guess how much taxes did I pay

no, Bitcoin can't save people from socialism

i actually started to use Binance, hoping that USDT won't disappear.... They don't have any stupid KYC 
Will check out Coinapult and Coinjar.

I bought my first bitcoin for $2 
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:51:48
do you know if I need to get verified to trade buy USDT there?
@_date: 2019-02-27 19:52:48
no one is using this shit, you have to spend at least 10k for a domain for serious folk to even read about your project 
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:46:03
I feel a lot of frustration, are you well my poor friend? Try praying to fiat god, may be things will go better for you. Or pay more taxes, this also helps for good mood

You can start by saying bye bye to your savings.

hm i met some serious teachers and practitioners in Chiang Rai in the mountains. Also sometimes giving a young poor person education changes his life for the better. 
I dunno, but this sub is disgusting - all they talk here is about price as if it's not a pure gamble. Even when you invest in some cool startup you can change the world and your life for the better. Here it is just wealth distribution from more dumb guys to less dumb guys who happened to be the first. Btw I am an early adopter, got my stash stuck in MtGox.

I keep farting after beer, every time I sip beer, I fart just a little.A few months ago I farted and now I still fart more or less the same. I’m not really a “farter” type of person but I do get the urge of farting. I just wanted to share this, :)

give to some poor people in your country, pay for some monks, offer to some buddhist teacher. don't invest in something you have no clue about just because other people do it. use your own fucking head

does Coinbase follow [CRS]( Doubt it. And fees are better than 30% income tax in EU
