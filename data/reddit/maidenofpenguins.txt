Thank you!  That's a great idea.

Buying medicine.  I have a number of friends here in the US with shitty transphobic insurance/doctors who wouldn't have access to the medicine they need if not for overseas pharmacies that take bitcoin.
Usually I'd buy a little bitcoin at a time whenever someone told me they were running out of a prescription, then about a month ago I decided to just buy a whole bunch at once and save on fees and wait times.  Lucky me, I managed to buy during the $6.6k dip, and it's been a wild ride since then! :P
Edit: Forgot about my cousin's dog, too.  Puppy insulin isn't cheap, but turns out it's a lot more affordable from India.

Huh?  If you buy a dip and know it to be a dip, that means the price is less than some previous price.  Every previous price is less than or equal to the highest ATH.  Thus every dip buy is less than the previous ATH.
Maybe I'm missing something but I don't get the difficulty of buying dips.  I keep myself updated of ATHs.  I know how much I can afford to spend/lose next time I buy.  So when I hear about a dip, if I have some money allocated for my next purchase and I can buy at less than the ATH, I do.  Otherwise I don't.  I miss out on plenty of dips, it's impossible to get them all, but when I buy it's always a dip.  Then hodl!

I recently had the idea to make a tool for syncing my bitcoin balances with my Mint.com account.  Turns out I wasn't the first - there was a tool at one point, but it hasn't been updated in over a year and is currently non-functional.  So this is an updated version!
I use it myself and will try to keep it up to date with the Mint api should it change, but if anyone else finds it useful I'd be glad to hear about it, and feel free to contribute with bugs found, feature requests, or pull requests!

Good luck storing an infinite string in any filesystem.

Not from where I can see.  Perhaps a person (Roger, whoever) uses BCH in a deceitful manner, tries to trick new users into thinking BCH is Bitcoin, that person is running a scam.  But BCH is not a scam, it's a technology.  There are viable use cases for any technology, given the right requirements.

I don't think so.  But, assuming the previously dusty addresses are now dust free, more coins will likely never be sent to them in the future, and those addresses can fall out of any ram cache since they're never touched in future transactions.

You'd have to store how many times you dereferenced the indexes though.  Unless you store those numbers indexes... ��

It might help if you explained what you are trying to accomplish (bitcoin addresses can't start with an E.)  If you're trying to make a fork...best of luck?

Not quite those odds, my non binary partner is a fan.
