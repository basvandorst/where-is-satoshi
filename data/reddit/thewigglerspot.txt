Pretty awesome... What will happen to all the pending transactions that are still "pending" on Aug 1st?
I am not sure what the purpose of the email they just sent out was when they are clearly not instantly sending out transfers and on August 1st there will be a ton of people that initiated 12-24 hrs prior ( or more!).
Is this a blatant attempt to steal the forkCoin or what?  Why can't they just send it out to the blockchain immediately like everyone else unless there is larceny in their hearts? 
Going on 12 hours here.  I am not sure if "pending" means "we are considering stealing your forkCoin. When we decide, we will either leave you in 'pending' state forever, or pay you. Thanks for letting us rob you".
Surely these people have integrity?  They sent out an email telling me to take my money out of their wallet so I can have the forkCoin, but they are in serious slow pay mode right now.

How short are you on coins to redeem withdrawals? Is it 10s of millions or hundreds of millions?

Re-sending that email was definitely a gold-plated corporate suicide moment. What were they thinking? They already sent out one email, they clearly don't have the coins to send out for everyone else. Pretty awesome.  They knew a hard fork was possible. They knew they weren't gonna support the forkCoin.  WTF were they waiting on to by up the BTC so they could handle the run.

They begged their users to expose them as not having their BTC on hand. I mean WTF?

Almost 12 hours here.  Good luck to us.

They aren't processing BTC transactions or doing so very slowly. How does this fit your translation of "reasonable"?
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:26:17
They aren't sending out the BTC. "Aug 1" really means something different with these people.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:35:13
You can't get your BCC from Coinbase after Aug 1 and you can't as of now w/d BTC.
You can't see what the problem is?

I was talking fiat money. It's obviously a huge number.

"Why would there be any legal action against Coinbase?"
BC they aren't broadcasting withdrawals to the blockchain and it's not August 1st.

I think you are missing the point - they aren't paying.  "Aug 1" meant "July 26th" to them, or something

Giving a warning was the 100% right thing to do. They aren't processing the requests now.  Feels like a fractional reserve nightmare. Not sure why they kept sending out the emails telling people to expose them.  Friggin weird.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:43:32
So the people behind the biggest bitcoin wallet on the planet were really just fractional reserve globalists? Sounds about right
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:51:34
You don't know that. They never have to broadcast the withdrawals to the blockchain.  Who, exactly, is going to make them? And a better question is - what did they do with all the coins they clearly don't have yet exist as a liability on their excel spreadsheets or however they run this "company"
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:44:37
They sent out multiple emails basically begging people to w/d.  It's like the guy with the send button needs to have a convo with the guy with the calculator next time. I mean WTF?
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:30:22
They aren't processing the withdrawals.  They either don't have the coin or want a bunch of requests in limbo in Aug 1st.  Who knows. They are in serious slow pay mode right now.
