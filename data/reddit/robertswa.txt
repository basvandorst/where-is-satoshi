Record low? doesn't mean what you think it means....

I mean, if you are audited, the burden will be on you to demonstrate that your accounting methods are consistent and legitimate. They will, of course, reference records from the exchanges that you've used as available. The government will assume a cost basis that is unfavorable to you--you need to be able to clearly account otherwise. 
Furthermore, you've already (apparently) recorded some loss--did you already account for this when filing taxes previously? I would hope that your present story aligns with any previous filings...
There are legitimate ways to reduce tax burden associated with cryptocurrency transactions. Fudging your books (or making up a fantasy transaction history because you don't have any records) is not one of them.

You absolutely can do this--it's called arbitrage. It exists in most every market--more mature markets tend to reach equilibrium much, much faster. Add in modern mechanisms (i.e. computers trading automatically at high frequency) and arbitrage becomes more difficult.
In the BTC markets, a large part of the challenge is liquidity. It takes time to add more USD (or EUR, or your local fiat) to the exchange. If you don't have $$$ in your account, you can't buy. Then you'll need to move the BTC from one exchange to the other. This takes time (especially with current mempool depth). If you're willing to eat larger fees, this can be expedited-- but your profits are starting to erode due to TX fees. By the time all of this happens, the prices may have converged. 
If you leave substantial balances of BTC and fiat on multiple exchanges, you probably have a better shot at leading the market price and succeeding in arbitrage. You also then accrue the opportunity cost of leaving fiat (vice simply purchasing BTC and holding) on either exchange.
Also, every transaction back and forth from fiat is going to be taxable income for you (depending on your jurisdiction, but I write with a US-bias). You lose the ability to hold onto your position until it vests into long-term capital gains rate eligibility.
Just FYI.

Please, for the love of god, remember that you have to pay taxes on any gains--and that short-term capital gains tax rates are kind of high. The point being--short term cap gains + credit card APR means that you need the price to climb significantly to actually be profitable. There were probably lower-interest sources of financing to speculate with... but to each his own. Best of luck, homie! Just know you're being a little (a lot) reckless.

? I think it is worth being a little clearer with your suggestion, here. When you say "sell at the end of the year", you don't mean "sell at the end of the same year you bought it"--because this would be short term gain, which is subject to taxation as ordinary income at graduated rates... which may also bump you out of the lowest bracket. I kind of get what you're getting after, but it's not 100% clear to people who aren't well-versed in tax regulations.

No, sales tax does not cover the appreciation of your underlying asset. You still have to account for the cost basis (what you paid for the bitcoin you spent) vs. the realized value you exchanged it for. That is, as far as the IRS is concerned, you didn't exchange 1 BTC for a Rolex Watch--you exchanged it for the $$$ of the watch. In the US, there is definitely taxable income to be reported there.

I recognize this, and am usually sensitive to common errors (as a speaker of three languages). Given the username associated with the parent comment, it's pretty likely... but I still found humor in the context of the error.

There are a few options for reporting your cost basis--but the most common, and the most straightforward is called 'First in First Out'. In your scenario, this means that the first bitcoin you bought--at 1k, is the first one you sold, at 10k. You report 9k in profits. In the second year, you sold your second bitcoin (originally bought at 2k), for 18k in taxable profit. However, due to the time elapsed, it is now a LONG TERM capital gain, which is a taxed at a substantially lower rate.
The point to first-in, first-out, is that you consistently apply the method of accounting for your cost basis. You could just as easily do last in first out--but once you start using one method, you kind of have to stick with it. Make sense?

Note  You still have to file these capital gains, even if you're claiming 0% tax rate liability.
Note  You are only eligible for 0% long-term Cap Gains if your income is less than $38,600 for tax year 2018. The strong majority of people in the U.S. with disposable income to throw at BTC are probably in the second bracket (15% rate) with income between $38,601 to $425,800.
Note  These thresholds grow if you are married and filing jointly.

So, 1.2 billion annually? Chump change for institutions.

I'm sure you took the opportunity to short BTC and made boatloads, then... right?
