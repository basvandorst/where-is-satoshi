It's not really a server but just a headless version of bitcoin-qt, the regular client everyone see's.

I bought from Amazon (certified reseller) with no problems. Just make sure to inspect your package when you receive it. The Trezor comes shrinkwrapped and if you suspect the package was tampered with return it ASAP. It's not easy to open so you should be able to tell right away.

Maybe you should read the whitepaper; that would be a good start. You clearly have large gaps of knowledge regarding to how Bitcoin works at a fundamental level.

Yeah it's called buying Bitcoin directly. Don't fall for "stocks" or "ETFs" representing BTC, you don't own anything directly. Best way to own BTC is to buy it direct through an exchange or from another local person.

Providing some evidence would be a start.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:07:13
Yes. Wherever you had the BTC stored before the fork, move the coins off there to another location. Then get a Bitcoin Cash wallet and import that private key from the original wallet (if you were using Electrum for BTC Electron Cash would work) and sell it ;).

Scientists have already built basic quantum computers that can perform certain calculations; but a practical quantum computer is still years away.
Creating a quantum computer is a massive scientific and engineering challenge. As of 2016, the largest general-purpose quantum computers have fewer than 10 qubits. Attacking Bitcoin keys would require around 1500 qubits. Humanity currently does not have the technology necessary to create a quantum computer large enough to attack Bitcoin keys. It is not known how quickly this technology will advance; however, cryptography standards such as ECRYPT II tend to say that Bitcoin's 256-bit ECDSA keys are secure until at least 2030-2040.

Again you are just showing your own lack of knowledge. The internet was never proposed to be a "stateless decentralized platform." Perhaps you are thinking more of Usenet.
All internet traffic is routed through key major players; meaning it may be "flat" in a way (when thinking of decentralization) but a few key players still control all the "entries &amp; exits."
Either way it's clear that your opinion will not change because you are biased in your thinking and haven't done enough research and for that reason I have no further inclination to sway your thoughts.

Again, you don't need to buy BTC with fiat, or vice versa. And of course, you don't need to buy a full 1 BTC at a time so you don't need to bring $5,000 cash in your pocket. And you just proved my point, exchanges are not needed to do BTC transactions.

Bitcoin has been around for over 8 years; I wouldn't call the technology "speculative".. it has come a long way since it was first released.
Also your entire argument is based on subjective opinions. The price is what it is because people are willing to pay the current amount for it. If you look at Bitcoin's market cap; it is still tiny in comparison to almost every other financial tool.

You should write down your seed somewhere and store it in a lock box or somewhere else that is safe.

Agreed. I have almost every daily site I visit in a dark theme. It's so much easier reading grey/white text on a dark background. Hopefully they hear us and will add this feature. The new design is definitely an upgrade over the last one but it is very white/bright. Burns the retinas of us nightowls.

What a strange question.

No because actual quantum computing/programming is pretty much still theoretical at this point. No one is actually building hardware outside of a tiny minority that is doing something very specific.
It'll be tens of years before we see any practical hardware/applications.

Can you link me to the docs on this by any chance?

Oh my lord. This happened almost a year ago. I'm sorry! This is why I always triple check my transactions before signing them.

Bitcoin has almost a higher market cap than the entire GDP of Kazakhstan. Let that sink in for a moment.

In what world are you spending 20% of your transaction costs on fees? I sent $200 yesterday for a fee of 35 cents.

Anytime you hear things related to "levels" and "recruiting" other people to get them "below" you and such &amp; such; you run away faster than Forrest Gump running after the bus.

No one cares about Kazakhstan, sorry to break it to you.
