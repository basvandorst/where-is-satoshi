Okay thanks for tips. If i just connect my bank account the provider won’t be able to see my name right? So i could use my parents name and my account.

Yea I’ve heard some bad stories about their customer support and lack of care. What do you recommend i use?
Also, the debit card i would be using is in my own name, but the account would be in my parents name. Would that be okay? Or would i need to use their debit card. 
Edit: credit —&gt; debit

I will buy bitcoin, litecoin, ripple and several other alts. Looking to put about .01 BTC into ripple and holding for a while. I’m going to buy one whole litecoin and use the other .01 BTC i will buy to day trade alts. 
I will start with just needing to buy BTC and LTC on coinbase though.

Exactly. I just don’t want my account with a few hundred dollars in it flagged. With coinbase’s poor customer support it would be a bad situation to be in.

Ah okay. Thank you for the help!

There actually is a bitcoin ATM about 5 miles from my house. Thank you for pointing that out! Can i just use a debit card to purchase my bitcoin? Thanks for the help!

Okay that sucks. I’ll buy local then

Okay cool. Thanks for the help!

Awesome. I have a bank account with 40% my money and 60% their money so some of my profit is already going to them. Would it work if I use my credit card that is in my name on an account under their name? Do you think this would work on coin base? Thanks for the help BTW.

Okay. I’ll just buy local then
