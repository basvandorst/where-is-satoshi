You're *grotesquely* misrepresenting what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is a **fixed supply** disinflationary civil asset forfeiture proof GLOBALLY accepted currency and general purpose distributed ledger.


Absolutely true. With sidechains, LN and voting pools, you'll be able to make international BTC payments for nearly zero fee.


Bitcoin, at its best, is a transparent globally distributed ledger everyone can keep on their home desktop PC, trustlessly and without sacrificing privacy or censorship resistance. Cold storage is Bitcoin's  use case by a very wide margin.

just, no
**Which wallet do I use?**
- Full node wallet

  - You can afford to spare some computer resources (hard drive space, RAM, bandwidth)
  - You are an online Pablo Escobar who needs maximum privacy
  - You are a hipster who like using retro software
- Lightweight wallet

Anonymizing technologies work best with very wide adoption for maximizing the anonymity set.
Imagine Tor was active on all web browsers starting from the 1990s. Most people would have NO IDEA the benefits of running Tor, but would do so because that's what their computer did by default.
Wouldn't you agree that world is leaps and bounds better than the status quo for freedom of speech, privacy and civil liberties online?
When we discuss full nodes, yes - it's understood unversed users won't recognize any benefits - but just like they don't recognize the benefits of a wide anonymity set, enforcing the wide anonymity set IS WORTH THE PRICE.
By being conservative about block space, ordinary people will be able to make the initial blockchain sync - from 0 to current - **in 5 minutes flat**. This changes the game for SPV, because it means you don't need SPV anymore - full nodes, through conservatism, will have become affordable and within reach of *anyone*.
But if we don't do that, full nodes are going to end up in datacenters, run by Corporations - which you would know all about judging by your slides which read like a brochure for blockchain-as-a-service companies. You've even made a combinatory API for all these Corporations, and were planning on showing it off at the event.
