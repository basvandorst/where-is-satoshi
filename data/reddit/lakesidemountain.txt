If you 'spend' on transaction fees how is that handled? If the transaction moves BTC to an exchange and then the BTC is sold on the exchange I assume the transaction fee would be treated as a cost of sale. Is that correct? What about when you move BTC from one wallet to another for security? Is that treated as a 'sale?' Is there any difference in how transaction fees are treated if you are claiming short vs long-term capital gains?

Not surprised. Kraken is not allowing us to withdraw amounts that were stated on our withdrawal page that we could withdraw. They said it is due to recent changes in compliance, and that now withdrawals into U.S. bank accounts are lower. We deposited believing we would be able to withdraw much more. If anyone at  is reading this please respond so everyone will understand the situation. The request # for the case is 483028

Seems like USD withdrawals are a huge problem on Kraken. I have been having trouble for a long time now and I see so many others having trouble, too. Wish I had read about other people's experiences before depositing with them. my request number is 483028

We are actually trying to withdraw... something they may not want. I have seen numerous complaints on various subreddits about people having a very difficult time withdrawing USD. It is a big problem others should be made aware of. When asked if this was government compliance the answer was something like payment processor compliance I think. Anyway they did not say it was the government. The point is that everyone should know that if they plan to withdraw USD they should not count on what is printed on their account withdrawal page on Kraken as being their withdrawal limits. Too many people are complaining for this not to be a really big problem.

Already tried this, but tried again. Thanks for responding. Is there any way you can send the issue to someone? @_date: 2017-08-05 03:07:06
I am not at all surprised about your experience. I have spent literally hours emailing, going through support, etc. and have received numerous emails that do not make sense. Most of the time I believe it is due to a lack of command of the English language. My problem is with USD withdrawals, too. Kraken request number 483028

You are right about not blaming the employee, but I assumed it would be a fictitious name. I will edit just in case. Thanks.

I have sent a large amount to Dave and have received small amounts as requested but am still waiting on large amounts requested. Will let you know how this turns out.
YES!!!!!!!! Dave accessed my wallets! He did it in less that 24 hours! I cannot say enough good about the experience despite the fact that I got nervous at one point. He was recommended to me by 3 different people who are trusted by many in this community. I wish I could say who, but I feel it is up to them to give an endorsement personally. While I have never met Dave in person I  would trust him with money any day. Besides all that, he is a very nice and patient guy.

Dave has educated me at this point so that I don't make mistakes by doing what I was wanting to do by receiving large amounts in a way that would not be good. I will have to set up safe ways to receive. Thank you, Dave.

Dave decrypted my password, and he did it in less than 24 hours! Can't say enough good about him. Thanks, Dave. He was recommended to me by 3 different people who are very trusted within this community. I would like to say who they are, but I feel it is up to them to make any public endorsements.
