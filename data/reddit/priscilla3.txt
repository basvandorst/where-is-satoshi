What is a high powered assault rifle?  How does it differ from a regular assault rifle?

So it's becoming better because it's becoming like every other currency?
That's what I gathered from the first bit, and I don't care to read the rest of it.

It's not that most people really care (I'm sure some do but not the point).  It's a shared interest.  
Bitcoiners want to see bitcoin succeed, and what better way than by displacing a fiat currency?
Greeks want to have their money in their control, and not lose everything because of retarded governments. 
So you nudge them in direction of bitcoin because it fulfills their goals, making it beneficial to them, and fulfills the bitcoiners goals, making it beneficial to them as well.
