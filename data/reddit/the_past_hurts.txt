On the stock market they are contracts between two people on the estimated future (hence the term futures) price of an underlying commodity. For example you can buy oil futures, which is the same as buying a drum of oil without holding the physical product, you instead hold a contract with another person, the value of that contract goes up and down depending on the price of oil. But in this case it would be bitcoin.

Literally everyone on wall street. I have seen technology analysts say a company is a bad investment and people panic sell then it shoots to the moon. All people want is for someone else to tell them what to buy and sell so that they dont have to do any work.

Thats HOW you find the derivative. That second equation is the derivative of the first, meaning it is based off of the first and changes if the first equation changes.

Yes! Because GDAX is geared towards the trading part of it and coinbase is more for owning it, GDAX has significantly less fees! It might look intimidating but for trades in the box on the left, look up what limits and stops are on investopedia. They are the same as the stock market. Also if you are new to candlebar graphs look up how to read those.

It is possible but realize, those massive coroporations that have huge investment firms do not just have some guy sitting behind a desk saying "lets put 8 million in bitcoin" it has to go through boards, be voted on, and be discussed amongst peers. There is a good chance they are not because of how risky and volatile it is, and how it will probably be rejected as a decision about the company. This is the edge some retail investors get in the stock market which is speed to enter and exit positions quickly. Now many small investment firms may be a bit quicker and many doing this tactic at once could cause some serious commotion. But we will have to wait and see.
