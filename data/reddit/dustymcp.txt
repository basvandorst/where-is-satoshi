this wont happen instant and will take along time to implement for vendors and merchants, i understand the value of segwit and lightning, however it is a layer 2 protocol people actually need to use, the more using it the lower fees hopefully, but this wont happen instant, my guess is we wont see the effects for a year atleast, remember people needs to be on the same layer to transact so you will have localized nodes handling fees people need to go to these nodes, then is it even decentriliazed if few nodes hold the fee market and wont we end up with the same outcome as miners, with a minorty handling fees ?
Its all speculation, and i will be looking into creating fee nodes, seems very interesting atleast.

Get tenX card and just spend the bitcoins as needed? :D

I thought i did i said it would take a year for people to get onboard with segwit, if it happens and people are enjoying low fees, not much to do for bcash really.

Miners will go for profit, its their main role in the eco system cant blame a fox for killing the chickens yeeez.

How does this make sense, use another currency if you want cheap fees, so you want people to stop using bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:03:28
But you dont see the problem of sendng people to other chains for lower fees?
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:09:23
So high fees will get more merchants? im not sure what people really want, do you want bitcoin to be gold or cash it cant be both.. core wants it to be gold and bch wants it to be cash i dont see why both cant exist clearly 2 different types i own both btw.
