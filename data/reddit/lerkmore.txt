I did some searching, and I am having a hard time tracking down some of these libraries to their source. 
For example, the x86_64 version of [libzbarjni.so]( does not seem to match [its apparent source](
libzbarjni.so (samourai): 
8014f04c9b2c111d63cd0af15c66725903f04b10e02e6317b4b12d83c2782186  
libzbarjni.so (zbar): 
cef5fc833ba4e78f31387c386887b7403de82324a5c9a0e72df312a7d6a20376 
As for the jar files, I know I can look in them, but they are compiled class files. I imagine I would need to decompile them to look at their source, but even then I must ask myself: If I'm the only one doing this, can I trust myself to do this right? And by extension, can I trust my money with this stuff?
Please keep in mind that I really like the Samourai project. And I know it's alpha software. That's what motivates me to care :-)

A quick google search for "net neutrality poll" gave me an article titled [Poll: 83 percent of voters support keeping FCC's net neutrality rules]( Admittedly, this does not mean that NN has a big backlash. It just means that people do not like the arguments against NN.

You are right that our economy appears to be back on track, but it is disingenuous to say tax payers "made money" on the bailout. Perhaps the bailout to the banks could be seen as a very low interest loan.

@_date: 2014-02-09 23:29:13
Andreas mentions at around the 3:10 mark that all sorts of cartels are springing up in information, retail, electronics, media, etc due to patents, regulations, and lack of investment from banks. So, the implication is that bitcoin would help fight that. But the link between bitcoin and fighting patents/regulations is spurious, and the link between bitcoin as an investment platform and fighting cartels is also unfounded if we consider banking history (as I mentioned in my previous post).

As a thought experiment, what's your take on negative interest rates in Europe vs positive interest rates in the US? It seems like this rate difference incentivizes Europeans to covert their excess funds into US treasuries, which then drives up the US overnight rate. Since Europe is printing money (negative rates), the Fed must correct the imbalance in order to meet the Fed's target rate of 2%. This might imply that the recent overnight operations by the Fed equates to money printing since that is the only way to correct an imbalance caused by money printing in the EU. The feds other option would be to allow the rates to rise.

Don't forget about decentralization and the value of running a full node. Having your own full node gives you important security, privacy, and flexibility benefits. Plus, full nodes can give you a certain kind of "vote" in the bitcoin ecosystem (see UASF). Bigger blocks make it harder to run a full node, which in turn hurts you and the network.

If Obama separated children at the border, it does not absolve Trump of his child separation sin. But according to your own business insider article, the children in cages under Obama were unaccompanied which means they came to the border already separated. Trump's policy finds children with parents, and then separates them from each other. That is new, according to your article.
@_date: 2019-08-18 05:34:10
With you 100% on calling Democrats on their bullshit. Especially when they treat some people like crap and don't get called on it (and then get on the high horse). That being said, all my research points to the child separation thing as first happening under Trump. Not saying Democrats don't do bad things, but I've looked into this a lot, and I haven't found anything on child separation happening under Obama or Bush. 
Under Obama they wanted to detain whole families together for long periods but I believe the Flores decision put the kibosh on that. I think that's how we got to the catch and release policy which Trump tried to avoid by using child separation.

I don't share the parent's 'mortal wound' worries, but I do think that he's somewhat right about the 2 week loan bit. For example, [they list the repos]( and it shows a 14 day term repo for 49 billion on Sept 27th.
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:27:58
I think they use the spot price at time of purchase.
@_date: 2019-10-02 22:12:51
Yeah, they are probably 1 day repos for the majority. I don't think people normally worry when the fed greases the wheel to keep overnight rates low. I think people are worried because these are the largest repo transactions on record (since 2000). And they came out of nowhere. Excuses (reasons?) for these emergency repos include: the economy is bigger now; there is a demand for treasuries b/c of negative interest rates in the EU; basil 3 regs clamp down on liquidity; quarterly taxes are due or whatever.

My advice: people value plans/structure and people also value financial privacy. So, if they ask about it again just tell them you plan to hold until 2025 (next halving, but don't mention that). In a couple years when they ask about it, tell em you "lost some money, made some money" but don't give them any specifics beyond that. Be nonchalant, reserved, and private.
This advice also prevents panic selling.

Bitcoin Core nodes need to talk with each other in order to sync transaction data. The current sync process involves some duplicate (wasteful) talking because nodes only talk about individual transactions. This proposal claims to eliminate some of that extra talking by allowing nodes to talk with each other about many transactions at once. This proposal does not change the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead, it only changes how nodes will talk to each other.
You can think of this proposal as a more efficient method of streaming data. On a related note, have you noticed how you can watch higher definition videos today than in the past even though internet speeds may not have increased that much? That's because people figured out how to stream data more efficiently. I find it appropriate that Greg Maxwell's email on the white paper associated with this proposal is at xiph.org which is a group that has everything to do with improving the efficiency of data streaming.

Not sure if the poster got lucky in their prediction, or if they just submitted a bunch of predictions and only brag about the correct ones. 
Reminds me of an old sports betting scam that went like this: Get a list of mailing addresses and send out a mass mailer before a basketball game. For half the recipients, predict that Team A would win. For the other half, predict that Team B would win. Whoever won, take the winner group and send them another mass mailer before the next basketball game with half the folks getting a Team A prediction and the other half a Team B prediction. Repeat the process until you end up with a group of folks who believe you can predict basketball games 100% of the time. Send them a final mailer before the Big Game, and ask them to pay money for your useful prediction service.

Asking the Fed for perfect money and requiring ISPs to act like common carriers is not the same thing. 
Imagine for a minute that you might be wrong. What if things are really bad right now and we need to do something to stop it? What if the revolution hasn't come yet, but something bad is on its way and in a month or two it will hurt regular people? What if, in this version of world where you are wrong, certain types of physical infrastructure like gas lines, water lines, and fiber lines exist in such a way that it is really easy for the owners of those lines to hurt regular people by charging high rates and blocking certain things? What if it is super hard to strike back at the ISPs without appealing to the government? What if the brave and strong people who can stand are their own two feet are not brave or strong enough in this situation?
It seems like your ideology for hardening up the population is really just hurting regular people.

You can't get rid of the FCC with mesh nets because mesh nets are slower than traditional internet infrastructure. Also tor is not a good start because it can be blocked by ISPs. Do you understand the technical aspects of your plans? 
At the end of the day the FCC is still in power and ISPs can block websites. So the world is worse off. I understand that for ideological reasons you feel justified, but what does that amount to if you have no impact on the world? If the mesh net never gets built out, what will be your legacy?

I see. I guess its kinda hard to vote with your feet. Most people won't move, and those who can are typically considered refugees. And if someone moves into your turf, why should you need to move?
Also, I think your views on socialism seem shallow. If NN is socialism, then just about everything is socialism in our world. I always try to remember that the way things used to be were not that good either. The use of force by powerful people has traditionally been implemented by a govt on one hand and industry on the other. Check out the [East India Company]( as a good example. [Operation PBSUCCESS]( is a more recent example of this kind of power. Are these things 'socialism'? When powerful people do things, is that automatically socialism? 
I ask because when some people use that word, they say it somewhat thoughtlessly. For example, does classifying ISPs as common carriers actually make them effectively public property? Does that mean shipping companies are effectively public property?

I run a full node on one of [these]( It works great, and I see three benefits:
1. It allows me to verify transaction without relying on anyone else.
2. It helps me improve my linux, server, and bitcoin tech skills.
3. It decreases the barrier to entry for when I want to run a node on the lightning network.


Yes, but I would recommend a dedicated computer instead of your main machine.


It does benefit the community, but if you use a low powered pc, then it does not use much electricity.


Yes, you can point a lightweight wallet at it to verify transactions.


No, but when lightning deploys, you could collect a small amount of fees if you run a lightning node (or so I am led to believe)
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:38:32
So, your response confuses me because it seems like you want NN, but you want it to come from activist consumers who are willing to build their own fiber network? Seems confusing to me.
The reality is that when the FCC repeals NN the ISPs will still have to follow the FCC's rules. It's not like getting rid of NN will get rid of FCC control. In fact, the FCC will impose additoinal regulations on ISPs by creating new reporting requirements for ISPs. So, with NN out of the way, ISPs will have more power over residential customers, and ISPs will still have to submit to the will of the FCC. So, I'm unhappy that net neutrality is gone, and you are unhappy that the FCC still has all the control (plus new regulations). However, the ISPs are happy because they have more control. Can't you see everyone here loses except the FCC and the ISPs? Is that not obvious?
Also, ISPs will still pressure local jurisdictions to maintain their monopoly statuses. In fact, all companies seek monopoly statuses by their very nature.
You can fight high-minded battles about freedom and facing real problems, but at the end of the day your beliefs only strengthen the power of ISPs and ensures that the FCC still remains in power. In effect, your beliefs do nothing for the cause of freedom and do not face real problems. 
So, the question is, what real problems are you correcting? What are you doing for the cause of freedom? Joining with your neighbors to build out a patchwork of fiber connections does not count.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:35:59
Wouldn't that require multiple lines of fiber to each home?
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:40:55
How can you have meaningful competition among telcos? Wouldn't companies need to lay several redundant lines of fiber?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:10:04
The example you cite does not give the govt the ability to censor google search results or facebook feeds. The section you quoted says that people need to give the FCC the info it needs to do its enforcement work. That has nothing to do with censorship.
Also, lots of people have criticized the Communications Act of 1934, but [those same people]( often argue that common carrier designations are the right way to manage communications infrastructure. So, sure, the Act may not be the best in the world, but why would we do away with reasonable protections like designating ISPs as common carriers?
Also, I'm not a govt loving liberal, but I do think that we should classify ISPs as common carriers. The way we do that today is through the FCC. Perhaps we could come up with better legislation in the future, but right now I don't want to give ISPs the power to block websites. 
Finally, it seems like you believe that the govt gets its power from Title II. It doesn't. Title II prevents ISPs from blocking websites. If the govt wants to sniff and control, it will through other channels such as seizures and spy agencies. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:03:33
I don't understand how the government would ruin the internet with title II. Would they censor things like they do in the radio? How?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:14:59
It's cool that you have internet by radio in Brazil, but I think it is worth pointing out that you have one ISP per medium: one for phone line, one for cable line, and one for airwaves. Having one company per medium means that the company could block websites if it were not for common carrier designations. For example, in my home, I have the option of cable, dsl, and fiber. Fiber by far is the fastest option, but if that company decided to block a website I use, then I would have to downgrade to dsl or cable. And of course, those companies could also block websites. Do you see the problem here? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:00:38
Your link claims that title II allows the government to regulate Google search results and Facebook feeds. I have not heard that, and I don't believe it. Do you know of any real evidence for that?

@_date: 2017-11-29 02:33:51
How do you plan on "getting government out of the game"? Do you mean like an insurrection? Do you plan on voting the government out of the game?
The point is, after the FCC disbands NN, they will still have the power to regulate ISPs. Do you have some sort of plan to take the FCC out of the picture? Because if you don't, then you are effectively advocating for FCC power while also removing NN. I would say that your position seems shortsighted, but it isn't even that.

The entire point of the NN debate is that it will cost more money to use alternatives to facebook and youtube. Remember, facebook and youtube will become customers of the ISPs. They will pay money to ISPs to ensure access to users. So, if I want to watch videos online, it will be either youtube or something that costs more money.


That's a little melodramatic, but I will try to answer your question ...
I recognize that the government exists, and I recognize that business/industry exists. I also recognize that they are often run by the same cohort of people. So, when you talk about the government controlling things and when I talk about businesses controlling things, we are really talking about a very similar group of people controlling things. So, how do we make sure that we don't get screwed over by the government or by businesses? We could pretend that we are meaningful actors in a free market chess game, but we are not. Maybe "free market" is actually just an ideology, much like Communism in the Soviet Union or the Divine Right of Kings before that. Sure, I like markets a hell of a lot better than those other two options, but I have no illusion that I can depend on markets or central committees or kings to have our best interests at heart.
So, you can see how I find it very unsettling when people who deeply believe in the effectiveness of free markets will blame any shortcomings of their ideology on government interference. When, in fact, this "free market" is really just well-connected folks in business and government keeping things kind-of in some sort of balance.
And the thing is, I suspect you already know this. Most people can see that the FCC guy used to work for Verizon. We know about the revolving door of business and govt, Goldman Sachs and the regulators, etc. So if you believe that you can get rid of government and keep the businesses, then you are mistaken. They are made of the same people. You would need to get rid of or take over both! But how would you do that? I am not sure.
But while you are figuring that out, please don't shit on sensible regulations like making ISPs common carriers.

Right, we are not in a free market. So, why do you strongly support policy positions that assume we are?
As far as I know, in the US, we typically have one ISP per line. So, that makes one ISP for the cable line, one for the fiber line, and one for the DSL line. Maybe somewhere else folks have two different ISPs on a single line, but at the end of the day, one company owns that line and that company get to decide what websites get blocked if NN goes away.
Also, I recently learned the US does have wireless ISPs in rural areas, cuz I know we talked about that earlier.

So, instead of simply designating ISPs as common carriers, you believe that a better solution is to have a mish-mash of ordinary folks and piggy-back ISPs routinely threaten to double up the fiber network in each city?
Also, lots of business make money and still have unhappy customers. The way you do it is by getting money from side channels. In our case, the side channel money will come from internet companies (Googles and Facebooks). The importance of making residential customers happy will be in competition from large internet companies. Do you not see this?

As far as I can tell, Central Banks try to keep the interest rate market steady. This affects the interest rates for checking and savings accounts. Retail Banks want customers to put money into their accounts. Then, the banks loan out that money which provides income for the bank. To attract customers and stay competitive, the banks will return some of that money to account holders.
It used to be that the Central Banks kept interest rates high (such as 6%). These days, Central Banks keep interest rates low (1% or even negative).
From the perspective of customers who have accounts with Retail Banks, this change from high interest rates to low or negative interest rates seems different and strange.

I haven't noticed those comments, but I'll admit that maybe I have some blinders on. I went back through the comments for this article and noticed a comment that made it seem like banks were somehow screwing them over with negative interest rates despite the fact that banks make so much money. I can see how that could seem whiney considering retail banks do not exactly set monetary policy.

I agree that higher interest rates affect all types of loans. When the interest rates go up, people think differently about getting loans. They might get angry about these higher rates.
The change from high interest rates to negative interest rates for bank accounts makes people think differently about keeping money in banks. People might get angry about these lower rates.
I would expect people to get a little angry about both of these changes because they need to change their behavior in order to maintain their quality of life and not lose money. I don't interpret that anger to mean that people believe they have certain god-given rights. The anger probably comes from the changes they need to make to stay ahead in life.

I wonder how many fires have to burn until a 1-day block emerges. Also, could so many burn that the retarget block height becomes years away and blocks are only released every few days?

Not advocating for dilydude's argument or video, but we should note that the fed currently uses [overnight repos and 14-day term repos](

To be fair, the webush guy said that interest in blockchian tech is making a 'halo' around bitcoin itself. That seems legit.

Which attack disclosure are you referring to? I tried googling it but couldn't find the disclosure.

How much is a large amount? I would feel more safe using a trezor wallet bought from the trezor website. Alternatively, I would feel more safe using an old smart phone (non-rooted, wiped, install mycelium) as a dedicated wallet.

The trezor is available worldwide. Mycelium is available on android which may be of use to you, as well.

I might be confused, but I think revenue reflects volume which reflects Bitcoin usage. So, highest ever revenue would mean highest ever volume and therefore highest ever Bitcoin usage in the Square app.

To me, that's a lot of money. Do you have an old smart phone laying around?
