I want some of whatever you’re smoking.

Meanwhile Trump has had 2 calls with Putin in the last 4 days...

That’s because Comcast and AT&amp;T we’re suing everyone and everything out of business. Including Google Fiber. 
And literally cutting local ISP lines:

They're probably going to just allow users to one-time convert bcash to bitcoin.

I bought a coffee table on Overstock in 2014 for 1.2 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:36:50
No, you really can’t. Especially if you get audited. The IRS has tools to track BTC now. Good luck.

My limit is $50k a week.

You do realize that Title 2 of NN forced Comcast, AT&amp;T, etc to allow more competition on the last mile / utility poles, right?

Only if you're trying to hold BCH

This isn't even basecamp

Easy answer: because some people trust Coinbase's ability to secure their private keys over their own ability not to lose them.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:21:59
Not true. They said they reserve the right to give you your BCC in the future.

Fake buy/sell walls are nothing new in trading. Read the comments here:

What happens when both sides are equal in value? Not trolling. Legitimately curious as to what you'll do.

Uh, yes, that’s called an offshore shell account,  and why people have LLCs in the Caymans. Welcome to offshoring 101.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:56:43
That logic is true since the Fortune 500s receive that revenue from offshore entities that are technically not American companies (ie Facebooks European counterpart w/ offices in Ireland) is the company people buy ads from on Facebook Ads system, not the America entity, hence they pay Irish taxes on that money...

Like any other currency in the world. Gold has almost no intrinsic value anymore since new metals are better at doing the job Gold was supposed to be good at and at a fraction of he price.

Ding ding!

In this case it is though we know the future price of Bitcoin. Today’s price. A judge can assume that the plaintiff’s future earnings on that asset based on the market price today. In 2012 they couldn’t. Now enough time has gone by a judge can reasonably determine the damages. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:03:13
And not protect their customer’s assets. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:44:23
Actually it does. It's called Lost Wages / Future Earnings damages. Judges rule plaintiffs can receive what they would have made in the future all time. Especially in car accidents where people are injured. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:33:56
Tough shit. Pay up.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:33:22
This. You still owe the money regardless if you have it or not. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:27:46
If that money was earmarked for the IRS from the previous trade, you'd still owe that money.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:07:52
And the defense will make that argument, and they'll end up settling for around $10k a coin. Watch. But that doesn't mean the plaintiffs will be "made whole". There is a real case here and eventually judgements will be made.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:35:26
No, but a stock could be delisted out of no where and you’d lose your entire investment. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:52:04
So you're saying there's zero precedent for someone getting Furure Earnings judgement on a fraud lawsuit involving securities? 
Edit: Some light reading,
