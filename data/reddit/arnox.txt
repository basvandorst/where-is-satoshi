Silver and gold are now currencies? Cool!

Good god this is the most cringe thing I've ever read.

No, because I invest in real things. Businesses that provide services, that have customers, that produce goods and fuel the economy. I would never invest in a Ponzi scheme, especially one that depends upon wasting resources in order to exist (the fact that your coinz™ are acquired through electricity is the most damaging aspect of the whole operation. What a fucking waste.).
I have no interest in defrauding people. I have no interest in pumping and dumping. I have no interest in huge returns that are sourced unethically.


I'll donate $100 to a charity of your choice if you can prove this.

Seems like you drank the Bitcoin Kool-Aid around 10 months back. Guessing you bought in around $350?
Now that those coinz™ are going for $200, how do you feel about your investment? Be honest, how much have you lost already?

Because I don't own any Bitcoins and can look at the situation objectively. It's a pump and dump. You bought the dump.
Bad luck, move on. This isn't going to be a thing. Seriously - it's over.
