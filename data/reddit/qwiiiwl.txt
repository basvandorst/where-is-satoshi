I'm in Quebec, banking with the National bank. In July of 2013 I sold some bitcoins on localbitions using Interact E-transfers about $500 dollars worth.  
(it was my 1st trade, I was so nervous I posted about the entire process here :   
After 10 days after I received the funds I got a call from someone in the fraud investigation at the National banks Interact E-transfers dept. ( I came to understand that only two employees worked here, I was told I have banks second case of bitcoin related fraud, it was new).  Conversation was cordial. Bank employee told me my account would have been closed if I have not been banking with them for 20 plus years.
I was black listed from using Interact E-transfers till I could prove I was not part the fraud, Payment using E-transfer was sent to me via a hacked bank account.  I created PDFs of all my localbitcoins messages trade,  and escrow receipts etc.. showing that I have been acting in good faith.  I reported the fraud to localbitions and sent copies to my bank.   
About 10 days later bank called  to say that I  was removed from the black list and could use Interac E-transfers again. In the process I learned that E-transfers are reversible.   I never had to re-reimburse the $500 dollars.  It was absorbed by the other bank.  I
I have used localbitions again but never never with E-Transfers.  You should only use E-Transfers with individuals you know, even buying used goods on Kijiji.ca using E-transfers is a bad idea.  
You can sell a used fridge on-line accept payement with E-transfers only to find the buyer trying to re-verse the funds because he could claim the fridge was broken.  It's the bank employee that gave me a similar example, and when that happens your E-Transfers can be disabled while your investigated .  This seamed like BS, as if the Bank would start acting as a "negotiator" in trade disputes. But I now only use E-transfer with friends and family.
