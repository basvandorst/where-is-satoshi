Pumping and dumping is creating semi-artificial supply and demand. Pumping = buying lots of coins = increased demand. Dumping = selling lots = supply. The ones doing it are hoping to entice more people to do the same, so that they can get a certain momentum going.

"Bitcoin is not worth the risk."
That could very well be true, FOR THEM.
If they only invest in foreign exchanges, big stocks, or low-risk, rock solid, tangible assets, they could only lose so much if the market turned on them. Their investments would be mostly safe. Can you really fault them for that?
Claiming that there is no risk in BTC is just dishonest. It's pretty volatile right now, and it can easily go both ways. I think we're still just seeing the start of big-time mass adoption, and I'm hodling on to mine, but nobody can know 100%.

Are you sure you mean public key? That's basically just the wallet address. If you have the **secret** key (which you really should have!), you can add it to a wallet program (Electrum, for example) and it will calculate the public key and address for you.
If you do, I really recommend sending your BTC to a fresh, new address / wallet, to cut the ties with the seller.

I think the long transaction delays are offsetting the arbitrage opportunities.
Sell all BTC here and buy same amount of BTC there. Profit! ... And then your money and BTC are "stuck" on their respective exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:12
Yep. And then it galloped to $14,250 in a matter of seconds. It seems someone with a big wallet scooped up a LOT of coins.

Supply and demand. More and more people is interested in buying, and therefore driving the price upwards. There are no external factors, just people who believe it's worth buying, either as a fast and decentralized payment method, or as an investment object.
Lately, this has resulted in a crazy upwards spiral, where Bitcoin is getting headline news because of its incredible rise in value, and thereby creating even more demand.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:23:53
Too late to buy? Not at all. Just go on any exchange and buy some.
Too late to make money doing so? Who knows? Most people here don't think so (so expect highly biased responses to this poll), but nobody knows for sure. Easy as that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:24:23
No problem. Glad I could help. :)

There was much speculation about a dip, or surge, on the 10th, but there was no such thing. Who knows what the 18th will bring.
If you're in it for the long haul, I would just pull the trigger now. My justification: If you buy now at $17k, or during a dip to $10k-$15k (or lower?), you're surely doing it with the hopes of seeing much higher numbers than $17k later, right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:36:51
Looks fine to me. What exactly are you seeing?
I'm getting a handful of "/Satoshi:0.xx.x/", where xx.x is mostly 14.2 and 15.0.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:19:45
Wow, it was 1000 BTC when I checked an hour or two ago.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:42:42
Exactly. Right now, after having "fallen" considerably, it's at a +20% from yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:48:26
It's probably safe, but I'm always paranoid as hell when dealing with private keys, so I wouldn't just assume it to be.
Here's what I would do: Switch to incognito mode. Load the page. Disconnect from the internet. Generate, or type in your seed words. Find keys - write them down or whatever. Close browser window. Reconnect to network.
Clear cache, close browser, remove temporary files and reboot the PC before reconnecting for bonus paranoia-points.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:13:32
I'm mostly a holder, so I'll never sell it all, I think, but I might very well cash in some bits and pieces when I'm happy with the price or need some extra money. There's no use sitting on it forever.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:24:24
If anything, these fluctuations are CEMENTING my "hodlability" (I like that word!). Trying to game this market is insanity.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:32:27
Well, if BTC gets "completely adopted" (whatever that means), it's not impossible that we could get banks that store your assets, with a proper insurance framework to keep consumers safe(r).
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:39


My thoughts exactly! Climbing uncontrollably made me more concerned than the current correction and stabilization. Such a rapid growth makes people hot-headed and nervous, and leads to impulsive buys and sells that might not be ideal. That it didn't fall further is definitely a good sign.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:55:32
The safest option, actually the ONLY safe option, is to create the wallets yourself (digitally) and just send them (or get someone else to send them) the wallet addresses / public keys, and store the private keys yourself until you can hand them over securely.
You could then create some pretty graphic wallets and have a friend or family member print and gift wrap them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:51
Are you crazy? That could easily take a few more hours! :P
Edit: 16 minutes later. Now it's $17.6k. Wut.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:37
Well, they are different markets, so the prices aren't bound together by themselves. Traders usually smooth things out by arbitrage trading, though.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:48:48
It could be, but I kind of doubt it...
If the big boys collude and send eachother high-fee transactions, these "bogus" transaction will take up more space in the mined blocks, and push legit transaction out, and the legit transactions are their real income.
Taken to the extreme, they will only have their own transactions in the block, and earn NO real fees.
They also risk a non-participating mining pool finding a block and snatching up all their fees. If just *one* of the participating pools stops playing along, they will snag a lot of fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:24
Yeah, trying to trade in these conditions is just crazy. I'm just holding, and that's nerve-wracking enough.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:03
GDAX just came back. Trading at $17k and climbing again.
My nerves just told my ulcer to step aside. :P
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:40:04
This is the "correctest" answer. You own two coins, for which you have paid a total of $29k. The coins are indistinguishable anyway, so there is no "cheap coin" and "expensive coin".
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:28:48
If it's transferring to a bank you might be able to get Coinbase support to cancel the transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:15:41
[Oh no, look how far it has fallen!](
Calm down, man. It's fine.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:57:30
I'll yell it as loudly as I can.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:25:13
I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, but the price is determined by supply and demand. Nothing else. A lot of people want to sell at around $17k, and an approximately equal amount of people want to buy. (Well, not necessarily the same number of people, but they earn and spend a similar number of dollars.)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:09:27
I'd love to sell some high, ride the crash down, then buy back in, but there hasn't been any indications of when and where, so... For now I'm hodling as hard as I can. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:25:40
Generate a large new supply of hype, if nothing else.
Maybe some speculative traders will cash out after jumping on the $15-$17 ride and getting impatient.
Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:22
What in the...!? Someone is sweeping up MASSIVE amounts up coins right now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:16:52
1. I believe It is technically possible for a miner not to add any transactions when a new block is found (mined), but why wouldn't they? It's "free money" for them, and if nobody processes any transactions, nobody can spend their bitcoins. The system just stops. (In the future, block payouts (the reward for mining, so to speak) gets smaller, and transaction fees will be the miners' main income, not newly created bitcoins.)
2. You can set the fee to whatever you want, but as you correctly deduced, if you set it too low you run the risk of having your transaction stuck in limbo, potentially forever. (There are daily questions about this in this very subreddit, as there is a rather large backlog of transactions these days, as the fee needs to be set quite high to ensure fast processing.) It's the payer who sets the fee. The merchants will wait until the transaction is "confirmed" (= having been processed) before acting on it anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:29:02
Right. Sorry, didn't check what Lealana coins were until now.
Anyway, there's ZERO reason for the vendor to withhold the public key / address from you if you already have the coin. (Even if they were crooks they'd WANT you to deposit coin into it!) Maybe they're just very busy due to the sudden influx of new customers, or something?

Make a few columns: Dollars spent, BTC price, Total acquired BTC.
Sum the dollars and BTC columns.
Multiply total BTC with current price to see current value. Current value minus total dollars spent = profit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:19:44
And we'll laugh at you when it hits $19k again.
But as we both know perfectly well, neither of us have a fucking clue what will happen. So buy, sell, do whatever, or just sit back and watch.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:10:16
Yeah, I think that was the reason. There was a big spike in volume just as the futures market went live, followed by a little bit of rollercoasting. Seems to have calmed down again now, so... back to business as usual.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:29
In Electrum, and possibly others, you can import the public key / address of your wallet as a "read-only" balance. (Just don't import the private key, as that would nullify the whole point of the paper wallet, of course.)
