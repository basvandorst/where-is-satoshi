Too cool. I bought a Yalls article and the payment went through before I could switch tabs.

In the real world, I think you will see payment processors being middlemen. Remember bitpay? Imagine an entity like that, that makes one "class" of LN channel with each user, and a slightly different one with merchants. The merchant channels might close monthly or after accumulating X money, and they could have standby accounts ready to start picking up the transactions. The user channels stay active for X time, then roll over the funds to a next account. 
The middleman handles the "timing problems" and tech problems, and the merchants pay them for that.

Countless, in that he didn't bother to count them.

Yes. But, the way it is implemented is through ACS transactions. is simplifying, but s/he's not wrong. This is how P2SH transactions work too.

The reason is in the implementation. I don't FULLY understand it, but essentially every SegWit transaction is actually a "Anyone can spend" transaction; as opposed to a normal transaction which is an "only someone with the right signature can spend" transaction. 
So to any node that doesn't upgrade to segwit sees only the "Anyone Can spend" portion of the transaction, and assume it is a valid transaction. This is the "Small Box" in the video. Eventually, it will get spent by someone, and it will allow it because anyone can spend it. Meanwhile, Any node that has segwit will see the AnyOne can spend part, and recognize it as a segwit transaction. It will request the signatures aka witness from other segwit nodes. If someone tries to spend the transaction, it will check the witness to see if everything is signed correctly. If it isn't, it will discard the transaction.

What do you mean? SegWit transactions do use a private key. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:24:50
Nah. If you go to the link, Satoshi was talking about a highly connected node. The idea is that if it is connected to a high percentage of nodes, it could broadcast a given transaction to 50+% of the nodes before a double spender could. If it does that, and watches for double spend transactions, it could withing 10 seconds give a reasonable guarantee that the transaction would go through eventually.

Yeah. You could do that with a regular bitcoin transaction. It's like writing a check and handing it to dude and yelling "INSTANT TRANSACTION". No, dude still needs to go to the bank, and the banks still need to transfer money.

So far, every change to the protocol has been activated by signaling a "Miner Activated Soft Fork" (sometimes, you will see this abbreviated MASF). "Signaling" is when a miner puts a message in a block they just mined that says essentially "Hey, I'm ready for BIPxxx". When enough (&gt;95%) of blocks are signalling that they are ready for a BIP, it is considered"activated". (BIP = Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, the naming system protocol changes use).
Well, all of these changes have been activated through "Soft Forks" which basically means that anyone can continue to keep running their software because it doesn't break the protocol. But since the vast majority are now running the new software, anyone can use the new feature. 
But if miners never reach a supermajority, an MASF will never activate. Currently, there is only about 35% of miners signalling for SegWit. However, it seems that many or most of the non-mining entities of bitcoin (companies, developers, and users) want SegWit, so it has lead to a lot of in-fighting and political posturing. 
But the gist is that miners have provable ability to say "this is the support level for this BIP" because they encode their vote into a block. Every block represents an amount of computational power behind it so it is not possible to simply "buy a block". Users and companies run Nodes that signal information as well, but anyone can run a node. If I wanted to, I could run 40 nodes costing me probably only a couple hundred $/month. But if anyone could be running any number of nodes, then counting nodes is not counting people. So raw node count doesn't really represent support for a BIP. Thus it is hard to gauge "community consensus" in any meaningful way.

Aren't those all softforks?

One of bitcoin's biggest problem is scaling. We are currently using right around the maximum number of transactions/second processing power that the network can handle (I think around 7 Transactions/Sec). 
Segwit is a proposal to fix a not-quite-bug in bitcoin called "transaction malleability". Fixing transaction malleability will allow us to build "Layer 2" solutions that allow the number of transactions to scale up greatly while maintaining the security and trustlessness that only bitcoin can provide. They could also allow for instant transactions (currently, transactions take a minimum of 10 minutes to confirm).

Oh yeah. I was thinking about it the wrong way. My bad.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:14:20
Yeah. But this transaction isn't hitting the blockchain, and it doesn't need to. So long as they keep those computers connected to the internet, those transactions are as good as a confirmed transaction.
EDIT: My bad. This isn't a LN transaction. Just a regular unconfirmed transaction. This is indeed pretty dumb. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:35:39
This is true. But not really relevant.
