One thing that would be nice is if as a freelancer I could post things that I'm willing to do. AKA - 1 hour resume session for .002 BTC or similar. That way people who are looking for services can also come to your site looking for people who have the skills they need and just choose them straight out instead of going through the bidding process.

@_date: 2018-01-31 05:18:05
IMO it's quite the opposite. Wall Street understands the fragility of the dollar system. If they DIDN'T jump all over BTC I would have been very very worried.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:48:29
It certainly increased over if you had that savings in dollars that were printed away. That's my whole point. The value of the dollar will be inflated away and you're going to pay if your savings is denominated in that currency.

GDP is a terrible way to gauge how much stuff you "produce", because as I said, government spending is counted as a positive. It's no surprise that the establishment loves to frame the issue in GDP, just like they love to frame issues using official CPI and unemployment numbers.

By the way, inflation isn't a multi-generational thing. The money supply has doubled in the last 15 years.

% of GDP is a pretty terrible figure to use, especially when you consider that government spending is considered a positive.

The currency lost over half its value in 3 weeks. 


And of course you saying that bitcoin "lost half its value" is cherry picking the absolute very top and bottom of the charts. So MAYBE if you were forced to buy in at the very top and ALSO forced to sell at the very bottom you MAYBE lost a little bit of value in Venezuela. Outside that incredibly unlikely scenario, you're still better off holding BTC than the bolivar, because you KNOW what's going to happen to it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:23:18
I seriously see no difference in the end game. We're getting there slower than Venezuela but headed along the same path all the same. We have the ability to prop up our crappy paper money better than most countries, but you know what they say about the bigger they are....
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:56:31
I consider their willingness to pay what they actually owe, which is just under 0 in DC. They'll just devalue the debt to the point that it isn't very much money, and we'll all pay for it that way. Great.

Why do I care what other countries debt looks like? Being the skinniest kid at fat camp still means you're fat. Trusting one government's fiat scheme a little more than the others isn't an endorsement of the scheme. The end game is always the same, overprinting and a collapse of the currency.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:52:07


Did the people abandon those systems or did the people who benefit from fiat abandon those systems? Remember, they had to literally outlaw private gold ownership to institute the dollar system in the US.

Which stems in large part from monetary inflation. The thing is, when you give rich people a bunch of money it doesn't spread out evenly through the economy, raising all prices evenly. It tends to bubble up the stock market and land prices first, then when those explode we end up paying the price. (again)
Fix monetary inflation and you curb price inflation. Of course, nobody in DC is interested in fixing monetary inflation because everybody there is getting rich off newly printed money being "lobbied" about.

@_date: 2018-05-14 00:43:52

You're not understanding. When I say market equilibrium, I'm referring to the time after the disaster has passed, prices are back to normal and life resumes. We want to get there as quickly as possible. You're reading meanings into words that don't exist and then arguing against them.


They run out a lot faster if they are not able to adjust their prices to signal that shortages are imminent, say via anti-price gouging laws.


This doesn't have anything to do with the prices they sell their products at, except for if they could raise the prices they would be more likely to both have supplies in the first place, and be willing to stay at work to sell them. The storm is going to cause damages either way. You're only handcuffing the rebuilding by mandating they can only be open if they can sell things for normal prices.

You're completely ignoring the fact that the way that we help people is flooding the affected area with supplies. We incentivize people to bring in more supplies than normal by offering to pay more for them, just like we pay more for Uber rides on a holiday.


It's a really really simple question:
Do you want relief effects to have the power of the government and charities, or do you want them to have the power of government, charities, and the free market? 
If you restrict the market from doing its thing, you are simply going to funnel everybody into the government system, which then gets overrun because it only has the capabilities of helping the very worst off. 


And you ignore what actually happens: People see that water is selling for $20/bottle and the area is flooded with water, quickly dropping the price back to normal. People who don't REALLY need the water pass at $20, because making ice cubes isn't a priority. The people who need something to drink actually have it on the shelf, and are happy to pay $20 for it. 
In your scenario, whoever gets to the store first is going to get all the water, regardless of who needs it most. Since it can't be sold at more than $2, no more arrives unless it's via government or charity.
By the way, thought experiments should have some sort of logic behind them and not just be numbers pulled out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:15:11
Or maybe we just see that the dollar supply doubles every 11 years or so. Doesn't take a whole lot of math to figure out what the "living wage" argument is going to look like in 2030.
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:28:55
In a more severe disaster, your "anti-gouging" price laws are simply discouraging people from bringing you the supplies that you need. 
If you want to sit back and wait for government assistance, then that's your choice. Some of us like to have a lot more control over the situation. "Just fix the government" sounds easy but is practically impossible.
Allowing price gouging is the fastest way to return market equilibrium to a disaster area. Anti gouging laws just ensure that the people who showed up first get the stuff, leaving none for the people who truly need it later, while discouraging others from bringing supplies into the disaster zone.

I wouldn't say that bitcoin is the "one and true" solution, but I think that wresting control from the bankers is absolutely necessary. The decentralization aspect of bitcoin is why I've been buying it for years. I believe the "powers that be" will gladly print until we can't pay our bills and then buy up our stuff with newly created money if they think they can get away with it.
For some context, I lost a whole shitload of money when the US government shut down online poker sites, then started using btc to play again. So I have some experience that makes me a little gun-shy when it comes to trusting the system.
I don't see BTC "replacing" the dollar, but I do have a slight hope that the existence of BTC will allow me to shield myself from the coming losses of the dollar. Best case scenario it might actually cause some sort of reform to our monetary policy, but I just can't see that happening when the payoff for printing is so good.
@_date: 2018-10-26 03:42:29
Dude we double the money supply about every 11 years. 
I entered the job market in 1995 making $6.30/hr. Since then we've doubled the money supply TWICE. There's no way that entry-level job pays the equivalent $25/hr.
@_date: 2018-10-29 01:29:00
Generally us bitcoiners are talking about monetary inflation, which is expansion of the money base. Monetary inflation leads to price inflation, but not equally across all sectors. Through these means and also the hundreds of ways to manipulate CPI, you can have 2% "price inflation" (according to government, who has a strong incentive to understate inflation) while doubling the money supply every 11 years, which is closer to 9% monetary inflation.
It doesn't even really make sense to try to measure inflation any way OTHER than monetary inflation, because "inflation is 50% in health care and 25% in education and 10% in food" doesn't really tell you anything meaningful. If suddenly we could produce computers for $1, saying "inflation for computers is -99%" doesn't even make sense. Technology is the driving force behind innovation and price reductions, not some CPI measurement.
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:09:37
In 1995 we had $3.5T in existence. Today that is $14T. For every dollar in existence in 1995, there are now 4. 
You can do the math.
See the problem comes when you see this: "Annual inflation over this period was 2.19%." If you're doubling the money supply every 11 years, inflation is not 2.19%. 
An actual 2.19% inflation rate from 1995 puts us at $5.7T, just a wee bit short of the $14T actually in existence.

And your solution is to simply have the government solve the problem through magic fairy dust? Rebuilding requires SUPPLIES AND LABOR. Artificially restricting both because of feel-good policies end up extending the disaster and ensure that everybody is filtered through the government system.
What do you think the government can possibly provide that the free market cannot? 
[Do you think the free market turns trucks full of supplies around in the middle of a disaster?](


This is what you want to subject everybody to. Wait for government to come and fix it. Days or weeks if that's what it takes. 




You are nearly insane if you think that government bringing in supplies somehow hurts our argument. WE WANT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF SUPPLIES. Government will not be able to do it all. Charities will not be able to do it all. Do you want more help or not? 


So do I get 4x the water if I have my family with me? What if we all come in one at a time? Who's going to uphold your buying limit to make sure that "everybody gets some?" And even if are magically able to do do, the people who needed the water to stay alive got just as much as the person who's got cases of water already? And the store is somehow magically able to ration perfectly, even if that rich guy doesn't come and buy any water? This is why your scenarios need to make sense. You're just asserting things as fact and then passing them off as if you have a point. 
And of course your limit doesn't change anything AFTER the disaster hits and it costs more to get goods into the area. Once the store is out of stuff it will just sit empty since it's impossible to turn a profit by serving the community.
In the real world we use price signals as important information about what goods need to go where. Cut off those price signals and you simply extend the disaster.
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:03:45
Once again you're talking about increase in prices. This increase would (generally) not happen without expansion of the monetary base. As technology and logistics improve, prices should be coming DOWN for our goods and services. Instead the Fed tries to push on their rope to make prices RISE 2% year after year, and they do that by creating money.


No. No. No. No. No. No. 
The devaluation of the currency CAUSES THE PRICE INFLATION in the first place. In the last 11 or so years we've DOUBLED the dollar supply. What do you think that does to prices? How on earth does creating MORE money attempt to keep prices DOWN?
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:45:04
Today: $14.2T
Half of that is $7.1T -- Feb 2007
Half of that is $3.55T -- June 1995
Meaning if you were born in June 1995, there are now 4 dollars in existence for every one that was in existence then. Or maybe you entered the workforce in 1995 earning $6.30 like I did. Do you think that entry-level job pays $25/hr now? Of course not.
Now that in and of itself doesn't mean it has to be a COMPLETE disaster (If they used newly created money to fund government and slashed taxes, for example), but now realize that the vast majority of that newly created money goes to the politically connected, driving up the stock market and real estate. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:19:31
Your government is likely preventing the competition that would lower your price through sweetheart deals to the politically connected. That's the exact same situation as Comcast. The answer is to open competition, not enshrine bad economics into law.
@_date: 2018-10-29 20:54:45
First, expansion of the monetary base is what I'm talking about. Monetary inflation that leads to price inflation.


The value of a fiat currency doesn't "increase" in real terms because it's always being printed. It only LOOKS strong when compared to other fiat currencies that are also being printed. Having more purchasing power means your dollar is buying more because prices are coming down. You've got this entirely backwards.


You're talking about the price of the dollars, I'm talking about the price of the STUFF YOU BUY WITH THE DOLLARS. The expansion of the monetary base is what requires the price of the stuff you buy to go up. As they print money, the money already in circulation loses its value.
Expansion of the money supply causes rising prices through devaluation of the currency. All you're doing is falsely telling people to spend and consume via debt instead of building a solid economic foundation based on savings.
I'm sure nothing could ever go wrong.


And when their phony inflation numbers show up under 2%, what do you think they do?
We double the money supply about every 11 years. That's real monetary inflation of about 9%.
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:57:25

Having two or three different companies is a lot different than having actual competition, and such a situation is usually the result of favorable legislation.

Because the inflation rate isn't 2% a year, that's what I'm saying. We're doubling the money supply every 8 years. The CPI measures price inflation, which is a completely different and more easily controlled statistic.

Because even in the first world most people don't understand that the dollar supply is getting doubled every 8-10 years. They think the dollar is stable because prices don't often change THAT often, when in fact your purchasing power is constantly being printed away :/
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:03:09
One quibble: They SAY they're taking 2% per year, but the money supply is doubling every 8 years. That's 12.5% y-o-y monetary inflation. The CPI (which is the 2% target) doesn't even PRETEND to measure monetary inflation. Also, when you say that savings devalue, you're completely right, but the more important part is that **LABOR IS ALSO DEVALUED**.

That's my whole point, the price of bitcoin won't stay the same, because the dollars are devalued. A car goes from 15k to 30k. A candy bar goes from 50 cents to a dollar. A loaf of bread goes from $2 to $4.

Sorry, I'm speaking from the POV of a small biz owner. Crypto offers online transactions that cost pennies instead of online transactions with costs measured in percentage points. This is a huge opportunity to increase profit with no decline in service whatsoever. 


This is just not true. I've had plenty of customers have issues with their banking cards and simply walk out of the store without purchasing anything. It doesn't happen OFTEN, but it's certainly not a non-zero occurrence.

One of the reasons that bitcoin is so attractive is the constant and predictable inflation built into the system. USD just gets printed whenever the political elite need more money, and they ALWAYS need more money.

The price in USD doesn't matter so much, it's the fact that it can be sent worldwide for very very cheap.

@_date: 2018-02-21 05:32:01
That's backward. 
Let's say that today $15k buys you a car, and by happy coincidence 1 btc is $15k. So you can get a car with 1 btc.
But now let's say 10 years down the line the dollar is printed and printed and printed, now it costs $30k to buy the car because prices have generally doubled. What you expect the value of the bitcoin to be?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:46:59
It was all just conditioning so that "an acceptable" amount of inflation is expected. They're literally just skimming off the top and everybody's cool with it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:25:18
That's because in Dec 2013 you couldn't actually get $1200 for your btc. That was the pumped price during Mt Gox's dying days in which it was becoming increasingly obvious they didn't have the coins they claimed to have. IIRC the price never got above $700 on any other exchange at the time.

It's worth noting that if you believe in bitcoin the technology, you should be spending your btc whenever you buy anything (when possible) and then just using the fiat you would have spent to rebuy the btc.

Nobody cares except the people who own and run them. I got tired of running mine just to have the government taking home more money from the biz than I was. Certainly nobody in DC gives a shit about small biz owners, and dumb policies force more and more of them to close.

Well, sure. I'd be happy to set the inflation rate to population growth, or actual growth or something similar. What's clearly NOT going to work is "print as much as the bankers and politicians want". 
The fact that we're the reserve currency lets us get away with the scam for now, but how long will that last?
@_date: 2019-09-29 19:54:54


That doesn't make any sense at all. Why couldn't investments return more than deflation? If I can make 10% on an investment right now, suddenly I can't beat 2% in a deflationary environment? It doesn't make any sense. 
You keep saying that people will suddenly start saving while ignoring those people could be saving today.

Which is why "leave it up to the politicians" is not a sustainable way to run an economy. Venezuela is simply the latest example of what politicians do when in trouble.

Of course, cars and travel and food should be CHEAPER than they used to be because of technological advances. These savings are being robbed from you.

And that's exactly what I'm talking about.
And even in your first case, it's not difficult and part of how bitcoin is going to grow.
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:19:57
Exactly, they're forcing you to invest your $ in the financial sector so you don't get killed by inflation.
So first the banks make $ on the actual creation of money, then they make more $ when you're forced to put your savings in the financial sector to "beat" inflation, then they finally clean up after the crash buying all the cheap stuff with more free money.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:35:13
The dollar supply doubles every 8-10 years. It's a lot less "stable" than you think it is
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:24:50
Exactly. Monetary inflation in the US is running about 9%. Price inflation is a little lower, but without the monetary inflation we'd see prices falling as technology improves.
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:17:47
Stangnant wages because the fake economy based around printing new cash is overtaking the real economy. When you double the money supply every 11 years, people who work for a living will never keep up.

Surely the 937423rd time bitcoin dies will be the REAL death!
@_date: 2019-09-29 00:41:00
"Stagnating" a real economy is better than pumping it full of sugar until it dies. That's exactly what the federal reserve does. We double the money supply every 11 years at the behest of the politicians and bankers, then dole out the newly created cash based on political considerations. I'll take a sound, "stagnate" economy any day. But since we don't have THAT option, I choose to use bitcoin knowing what they will continue to do to the dollar.
The founders didn't say "Only gold and silver shall be money" because it makes the highest growing economy. They said it because they knew that if the power to create money were left in the hands of the bankers and the politicians, they would ALWAYS PRINT. 
And here we are.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:37:55
I thought they existed so that I could have something to trade to keep getting more and more bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:34:39


I hate to break this to you, but that's what's happening. Of course the money doesn't filter down EXACTLY and INSTANTLY, you see it pump up real estate prices and the stock market initially because those people generally have access to newly created money first. Then supply chains feel the pressure and bump up costs for manufacturers, who maybe just cut the size or quality of something instead of increasing price. Lastly, once nobody can afford rent or groceries at the "new" prices, wages finally "catch up" to the new normal. Of course while this is all happening there are tons and tons of people getting rich off the scam, while the dollars in your savings account and the value of your labor is printed away. 
Goods and services should constantly be getting cheaper because of advances in technology. Instead, government makes it harder and harder to get by because they are constantly flooding the system with dollars. This fact is at the heart of SO MANY of our problems, but nobody in DC wants to talk monetary policy because it's making everybody there rich.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:17:16
We can't actually see the FULL money supply because they stopped "reporting" M3 like a decade ago, but here's what we CAN see. When GW Bush was elected there were roughly $4.5T in the system. Today that's nearly $14T (that we can see). If we assume that the "real" economy was the 2000 money supply (it's not but let's assume), that means for every "real" dollar out there, there are over 2 other "newly printed" dollars that aren't based in economic reality. That's a whole lot of misallocated investments created by the running of the printing press, not to mention a whole lot of opportunities to "lose" a few billion here and there.
Edit: Actual 2% inflation from the $4.5T in 2000 would put us at $6.42T in the money supply. We're literally more than 7 trillion over that. That's a whole economy.

You don't just magically get rid of years of miseducation overnight. The people who put their money where their mouth was years ago are now being rewarded for their foresight. Those who don't understand the system will mock it and not participate, which is fine by me.

I'm pretty sure that we know Americans will still spend money even if it's technically not a smart idea. How many people buy new phones every year or two when they have a perfectly serviceable phone as it is?
Also if you believe inflation is 2-3% you're drinking the koolaid.
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:59:46
I put "stagnated" in quotes because an economy based on solid economic footing is always growing, although perhaps not as quickly as economies where the system is constantly being flooded with money. How happy do think workers in Venezuela are that min. wage went up last year?
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:19:30
But you don't get "steady and low" inflation when you can print money at whim. We are doubling the money supply every 11 years, which is 9% real monetary inflation.
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:25:28
That's because there are about 4 dollars in existence for every 1998 dollar.
@_date: 2019-09-29 00:43:51
Why would you not invest in a deflationary economy? If I can make 5% return on my money, that's still better than 2% deflation, is it not? Smart money will ALWAYS outpace moderate deflation, because the money being invested is creating things with real demand.
You can talk all about how people would rather save their money in a deflationary environment than spend it, but by that logic everybody would be investing RIGHT NOW because their pile of money will be worth more in the future! People spend their money because they want stuff. Sure, at the fringes people would save a little more, but that creates real capital for growth and we'd likely have a whole lot less empty minimalls.

We double the dollar supply about every 10 years. The 2% CPI raise that the government is feeding you is complete bullshit.
If real monetary inflation is 10%, you need much more than 2% raises every year. 
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:55:27
Since removing ourselves from the restraints of BW in the 70s, we've been doubling the money supply about every 11ish years.
$15T in 2019
$7.5T in 2008 -- 11 years to double
$3.75T in 1996 -- 12 years to double
$1.88T in 1982 -- 14 years to double
Government is only getting more brazen and less fiscally responsible, so we would certainly AT LEAST not expect the situation to suddenly reverse, right? So what does the dollar look like in another 20 years? We'll probably be "fighting for $30", right? :/

It's not an accident that the terms have been confused lately, because the government can pretty easily manipulate one but not the other.

Because prices should be FALLING when companies improve technology and reduce costs. You should be getting MORE for your money as these improvements are made. Instead of it getting easier to get by, it instead takes more and more dollars to get by. 
Not to mention monetary inflation DIRECTLY enables shit the government would never be able to do if it had to raise money via taxation, most notably bombing the middle east for decades at a time.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:35:30
I'm pretty sure YOU are talking about PRICE INFLATION, which is totally separate than real inflation. It's not an accident that the terms have been confused lately, because the government can pretty easily manipulate one but not the other.
In the post I replied to, measuring the "price inflation" of bitcoin wouldn't even make sense. We're obviously talking about real inflation.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:24:59
Because people have wants today. Why spend ANY money if you can invest it and have more tomorrow? This is possible right now! Yet we're all spending money all the time instead of investing it. People buy phones they don't need, they still subscribe to cable, etc etc etc. If people aren't investing to get 5% at least right now, why on earth would they suddenly start saving to get 2% in purchasing power via deflation?
What you'd see in a "deflationary" environment is people spending money they need to spend and saving what they don't need to spend. That puts our economy on solid footing, as savings is the driver of real economic growth. In contrast, simply creating the money and handing it out for political reasons means we're spending it on all the wrong things (ie, things people would not willingly invest their savings into)
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:29:44
If you don't care about monetary inflation, you just don't understand how more money in the system makes each dollar worth less. If you don't understand that, I can't help you. Constant printing of dollars devalues the savings in your account and the labor you work for every day.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:23:49

Except that the value was actually defined.




The government couldn't just give you whatever it felt like giving you, because the value of money was clearly defined. Now you can see why they had to confiscate everybody's private gold before they could get everybody onto the "paper standard".
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:56:57
So you think we're cruising right along at 10% growth without anybody anywhere mentioning it? Interesting.
Edit: Even if the "supply of wares doubles" you're still getting fucked by inflation because your money should buy twice as much. This is exactly what should be happening as technology improves. It should take less work to get by, not more.
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:49:10
Well we double the dollar supply every 10 years. You can do the math if that devalues your money or not. The government knows that it's impossible to nail down "price inflation" because monetary inflation hits some industries harder than others. Thus, you end up with hundreds or thousands of "price inflation" numbers, which tell you precisely fuck all about the overall inflation rate. 
If suddenly cars were free to produce and purchase, it wouldn't make any sense to say there was -100% inflation, but only in the car industry.

You're missing the fact that price inflation can be (and is) manipulated to mask your real purchasing power loss. The government has all sorts of tricks to convince you that since the quality of something went up somehow inflation is lower. 
Anybody who actually goes to the grocery store knows price inflation is higher than 2% a year, but when you can juke the stats you can really make the magic happen because you ALSO get to hide the real inflation rate, which isn't a perfect prince inflation indicator (because technology offsets the inflation in some areas, such as computers) and lags a little behind.
Monetary inflation, in addition to the loss of purchasing power and labor value, also allows the government to do shit like spy on us, feel us up, and wage war in the middle east for decades at a time. In extreme cases it causes the collapse of the currency, which you can see repeated over and over throughout history. The dollar is not special.
