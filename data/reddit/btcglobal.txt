With Bitcoin Startups you can have it
- **regulatory compliant and legal**
- **highly secure and well build**
- **fast to market**
but you can pick **only two** of them. Maybe it's amateurish, but we decided to go for the first two options and it took us a year. Here it is:

Hi Steven here,
if you received this email, then you were one of the handful of people personally invited a year ago to the share auction. I would have thought one would remember this. 
And if you don't remember this you could have at least remember to xxx my email out - I don't especially care about being spidered by spam bots.

 - Resend, we try to add as much last minute bidders as possible.

Anenome5 has explained it pretty well. :)
Thats the basic concept. We will make further details available as we go. Our over-all policy in all that we do is to make one solid step at a time. No need to rush, better make sure everything fits and then move on.

Licensing depends on the exact business model and the type of license you have to obtain for it. The $10M is an estimate from our legal team for our operations and take into account bonds, fees and consultation costs. There are additional costs in building the needed administrative infrastructure and one should keep in mind that there are also hefty anual fees.

Our headquarter is in Latin America where this is even more complex - so we are fully aware of this. I can assure you that we are working with the same professionalism on the legal and financial side of our products that we apply to the software architecture and the security aspects. I can't comment further on this at this time, as we are in negotiations with major financial institutions and politics but we are confident to come up with solid solutions in this aspect as well.

We have released a video about the Order Matching Engine earlier. Screenshots of the interface should be released in the next couple of days.

Yes, of course could that be done, we could also have better sound (and for those who pointed out that Vladimir has an russian accent: as we are an international team we could also create versions with speakers having German, Swiss, Swedish, Romanian, Uruguayan, a bunch of US American and some more accents.)
But honestly - We are not a video production compnay. This is just an internal quick shot we made this morning while we were testing for *ourselves* - turnes out some people wanted to see it, so Vladimir was so kind to repeat the test and say a few words. That's it.
There is a more detailed answer on bitcointalk if anyone is interested.

All of the above assumptions are correct. :)
We will roll out in Latin America first. We plan to roll out globally as well. There is a fixed schedule plan for the roll out, but we care more about solid technology, solid legal backing, solid banking support, solid customer service - then about plans. So we do one step at a time and make sure all fits. But no worries we'll also be as transparent as possible so expect news on this soon.
