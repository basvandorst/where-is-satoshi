I ave just done a couple of withdraws of around 5 BTC from my LBC account.  they were done around 1.5 hours ago but they are still showing as pending send.  
(i had 2FA enabled &amp; have lost none)
moving them to paper walet now.  
Yep I cant recomend LBC enough.  A really good BTC service.

Text from LocalBitcoins received a very dangerous attack against the site infrastructure on Saturday 3.5.2014.For now •All user data and Bitcoins are safe;•The site will be down for a while as the system is being rebuiltDetailsLocalBitcoins hosting provided received a request to restart the LocalBitcoins.com website server and give access to the server console (root) on Sat May 3 13:32:27. LocalBitcoins team did not initiate this request. For now, it looks like the request was made using spoofed email addresses and other weakness in the hosting provider support system. •LocalBitcoins team was alerted about the abnormal activity when the hosting provider restarted the server.•The attacker gained a root access to the server for ~40 minutes before the attacker was kicked out and the server shutdown.•All data on the website server is encrypted. Manual actions are needed to make this data readable, so the attacker could not gain access to the data even when having a server console access.  It is very unlikely that the attacker gained access to any data;  LocalBitcoins is still performing full investigation on the matter.•Bitcoins in hot wallet and cold wallet are safe, as LocalBitcoins runs its bitcoind and wallets on a separate server.•LocalBitcoins team has started to rebuild the website server on fresh hardware.LocalBitcoins team will make further announcements when the investigation proceeds and the site becomes available again.  We expect to spend at least 24 hours on this. LocalBitcoins team apologizes the issues the downtime may cause to the users.

the advertisment says for cash over counter only but you can do a transfer from westpac or another bank in NZ.   how many coins are you after?
@_date: 2013-10-06 23:06:14
Yeah localbitcoins.com mobile version is great.  "save to home screen" on my iphone.  Its even got a nice looking icon to go with it.
@_date: 2013-10-14 13:17:04
hahahaha..  what a champp.....
@_date: 2013-09-30 12:43:16
haha yeah yeah I know.  I have asked this question my self many times.  If these things were as good as advertised etc why dont these companys just plug them all in them selves and start mining.
@_date: 2013-09-12 11:52:54
this has to be a scam
@_date: 2013-09-29 13:35:04
I call a scam.
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:49:27
does the receipt paper fade under light? 
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:45:29
and then what? What can you do with 'MT Gox money"?  You cant with draw it.
@_date: 2013-09-30 09:32:19
Yeah wicked.  Are you getting the 200gh/s unit.  Hope this does not turn out to be like BFL.  What would be the max price you would pay for a 60gh/s BFL unit?
@_date: 2013-10-28 09:04:00
so wicked Ryan.   keep up the great work...
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:46:13
oh thats right.  Purchase Bit-Coins from MT GOX at a way inflated price.  Sounds like a plan.
@_date: 2013-09-12 11:54:41
i cant believe people still use mtgox.  
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:02:32
scam for sure.

I use ANZ &amp; CBA &amp; NAB &amp; Westpac.  I have had a LOT of Fraud attempts with ANZ.  ANZ have a great fraud team and 99% of the time we reverse the transactions before coins are released.  
I have recently had a issue with CBA.  They know what we do &amp; have no problem with us using their Bank to conduct a BTC business.
NAB seem fine &amp; so do westpac.  
CBA def has the best security measures.  Better than any other Aus bank in my opinoin.  
Wayside did you have much fraud through your account?  Did you actively work with ANZ fraud team to stop it from happening? I think this is their biggest problem with BTC traders but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:57:19
Youcan buy them from Me in NZ.  I have a westpac accou8nt you can transfer money into or you can cash over counter when the banks open on monday.  Ill post up a link in a couple of minutes.
@_date: 2013-09-30 11:36:40
UPDATE : I have since been speaking with the seller and have found out he is prepared to sell 2 X 60gh/s units for $4500 AUD for the both.  $2250 for each unit.  
any more thoughts ?  Thanks guys.  
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:29:53
yep.  not from paypal.  But stolen hacked accounts.
@_date: 2013-09-11 05:26:19
I pre ordered one of these a few months ago. So pumped for in in Nov!
@_date: 2013-09-30 11:24:18
Yeah I would never even get close to buying from them.  This is from a seller that has it on hand in Australia.  He has done the hard work waiting on it to arrive for over 1 year.
@_date: 2013-09-30 12:05:09
yeah . I think you guys are right. Thanks a lot for your help tonight.  
@_date: 2013-09-29 13:39:24
BFL. haha yeah if you want to throw you money away list to this guy.  They DO NOT DELIVER.  THEY ARE# SCAMMERS&gt;
@_date: 2013-09-30 11:35:37
Thanks mate.  Yeah to be honest I absolutely despise what BFL have done.    One of the worst stories I have heard about any company.  No morals or ethics.  I would never consider doing business with them directly.  Thanks for your input
@_date: 2013-09-30 10:15:15


wow after looking at that im not sure at all...
@_date: 2013-09-30 09:25:58
Thanks for your input.  Do you mine?  
@_date: 2013-09-04 07:49:36
hey mate.  I sell bit coins in NZ.  Westpac to Westpac online transfer or CASH over counter. check out the link.
message me through local bitcoins if you have any questions.
@_date: 2013-09-09 03:40:07
sell what ? BTC?
@_date: 2013-10-27 08:32:01
no you can just store them on your local bit coins account.  I would suggest signing up for a local bit coins account and go from there.  there are other BTC sellers in New Zealand as well
@_date: 2013-09-09 02:21:06
its all good and well to say you are going to 'tax' bitcoins.  The thing I cant understand is how they will enforce this. 
Long Live The Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:53:10
I had 20 BTC missing for a few days after a 'rogue' send shared transaction.  It did appear in my wallet after a few days but I have since not used this feature.  I cant trust it.
@_date: 2013-10-01 12:11:28
im still not holding my breath.   I'm not convinced until reddit readers start to post about their units after delivery.  This video is all good and well but I wanna see one in the flesh...  Looking good though guys.!
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:18:55
Yep I thumbs up LBC as well.  I use them all day every day to buy/sell BTC.  wonderful service. !
Their support has got a lot better just recently.

@_date: 2013-09-29 13:54:48
@_date: 2013-09-13 03:11:42
something has to be about this shit scamming company.  Need to be shut down.  This is way beyond a joke.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:21:53
because we sellers make it a LOT easier for people to purchase BTC.  Getting moneys to an exchange can be rather annoying.  Sellers on LBC provide MANY ways to purchase BTC.  eg. cash deposits/ Cash trades/ direct deposits.  Some sellers even except paypal !
@_date: 2013-09-28 15:23:37

Are you saying I should mine but not in a mining pool?
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:56:05
where are you watching these charts?
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:51:59
wow.  shit that dropped fast.!
