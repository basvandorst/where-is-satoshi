I'm assuming [HTTP POST]( probably means only buy/sell commands, not GET commands (like for just getting the price). Probably helps with server load.

This is how I do it:
1. Copy a zip containing the website (downloaded from github) to a flash drive
2. Boot a Linux live CD (I just use ubuntu)
3. Copy zip file to desktop on Linux
4. Remove the flash drive
5. Unzip the file
6. Open up the website .html file that just got unzipped in a browser, generate wallets, and print
7. Shut down
At no point do I connect to the internet while on that Linux CD. My printer has the ability to connect to wifi and do online printing, but since I printed paper wallets off of it I decided that I'm never going to use that ability. Maybe all that stuff is a little overkill, maybe not, but I'd rather be over-secure than under-secure.
Also, I got a laminator to prevent water damage. Hardware wallets are great, but I still think there's a place for paper wallets.

By searching online? Not sure if you've heard, but you can learn about tons of things by just looking them up on Google.

And even to try and get their money back, people have to *prove that they're innocent*, ridiculous.
I'm actually surprised places like WA and CO which have legalized marijuana but can only operate on cash (last I checked) aren't getting civil forfeitured them all the time. I mean, it's pretty much a blank check to rob people.

To generate the same address (public key), they'd have to generate a corresponding private key. Keys are generated by using randomized (as much as possible) input into an algorithm, the algorithm doesn't know anything about the blockchain or what keys have been previously generated, it's just math that spits out a number based on numbers fed into it.
So there's no guarantee that a particular keypair will not be generated again in the future whether it's made via a mobile wallet, paper wallet, hardware wallet, etc. It's possible for two separate people to generate and print two paper wallets offline that never get used that have the same key. It's also possible for a second person to generate a key for an address that currently has a lot of BTC in it.
The only protection is is the overwhelming unlikeliness of that happening. Splitting your BTC between multiple wallets might not be a bad idea if that (remote) possibility sketches you out at all.

They didn't need to add bcash support to help people avoid fees, they already had support for LTC sand ETH. Plus the timing is just too coincidental.

When I first got into bitcoin they advertised it as being able to send large amounts of money quickly and cheaply. Like $0.25 in fees, and generally confirmed within a block or two.
Now you either have to wait two days or pay $11? That's not what I was sold. Wire transfer being slower/more expensive doesn't negate the fact that it doesn't work like I was told it would. Like it used to.
Edit: I still believe in it. It's just currently not as great as I used to think it was.

Been telling my friends to drop even $20 on it since it was worth $250. They always said "I don't have any money to invest right now". They did, they just didn't want to. Welp, I tried, I better not hear any whining later.

I've been wanting to take a stab at a similar project for Android. What APIs did you use to get address balances for various cryptocurrencies? Did you need API keys? If so how are you keeping them secure?

I've been wondering something about using a Trezor with altcoins, what can I do to get my altcoins back if:
* I have a backup Trezor that I haven't taken out of the box
* I lose my original/daily use Trezor
* The Trezor website I would use to setup my backup is down (let's say forever)
I know I could use my passphrase on an app like Mycelium to recover my Bitcoins, but what about my Ether, LTC, Dash, Doge, etc? 
Do I have to just trust that the Trezor website will be up forever to allow me to recover my altcoins? If that's the case then I wouldn't feel fully comfortable storing anything besides Bitcoin on it, which hurts the desirability for me.

I'm wondering what the appeal of using a bank instead of a credit union is. I can't think of a situation where you'd want to do that.

It's amazing how no matter how many times it's said they still don't understand that. Or at least won't admit to it. 
I never understood the notion that some people seem to have that if they assert a claim hard enough that'll make it true.

I didn't know you could setup a Trezor with Electrum, nice. Also I'm liking the idea of the a Cryptosteel backup.
I did try using Electrum-LTC with my Trezor, it was wonky with passphrases, it didn't accept blank ones, but if I disabled using a passphrase on the Trezor it would work.
IIRC you can download a version of myetherwallet.com to use client side, which is promising. Also just googled "electrum-dash" and it looks like that exists too.
So as long as I keep a few backups of those pieces of software around in various places (safety deposit box, house, google drive, phone, etc) that seems like it would eliminate the need to trust that the trezor.io or any other website is up, right? (Besides the BTC and altcoin networks themselves, of course)
If that's the case then I might be convinced.

Good call, I want to do that but I'm not sure which android wallet to switch to :/

I'd rather pay a transaction fee once to move them out of an exchange and onto a paper/hardware wallet than leave them on the exchange and risk losing not just the transaction fee, but the rest of it as well.

* Don't write down your 24-word seed
* Lose your word seed
* Leave your word seed around where anybody can find it
* Don't remember your passphrase
* Don't set a pin or passphrase and lose the Trezor
* Buy only one, put all your bitcoins on it, lose it, then have no access to your bitcoins to buy a new one to get your bitcoins back
I mean, I've had to make my parents several email accounts for password reasons. Even when I wrote down the password and told them to stick it in their dresser they still somehow managed to lose it and had to create a new account.
The average user is just not responsible with their information. They check the "remember my password" button then immediately forget their own password. You and I don't want it to be that way, but it is.

I'm iffy about hardware wallets. I just got a Trezor in the mail a couple days ago and have been testing usage and recovery options, but haven't fully committed to using it yet.
What if the trezor.io site goes down, how am I supposed to access my coins? What if I lose my Trezor and can't get another one? The 24-word seed could let me recover my bitcoin using another wallet sure, but what about ETH, DASH, LTC, etc? What about if I use a passphrase with my Trezor, doesn't that ruin the ability to use the 24-word seed with something like Mycelium?
Sure paper wallets CAN have the private key in plain sight, but on bitaddress.org you can generate paper wallets with a passphrase (BIP-38) which would require a passphrase to sweep. (I'm pretty sure similar sites exist for DASH and LTC, I haven't found anything for ETH yet, that's a plus for the hardware wallet.)
I'd store my paper wallets in a fireproof gun safe, if something destroyed them while they're in there I'd wager a Trezor stored in the same place would also get destroyed under the same circumstances.
It seems like you're *always* going to have to trust that the trezor.io site is up and/or the chrome extension is available. Even if you buy a backup Trezor for the event that your primary one gets destroyed/lost/whatever (now you're up to $230+ worth of hardware, including shipping), the site/software needs to still be available to recover your coins.
And for what, what's the added benefit compared to storing laminated, BIP-38 encrypted, paper wallets in a fire proof gun safe? The only benefit I can think of is being able to access *all* of your BTC conveniently any time you want to.
I'm having real doubts that such convenience is worth having to rely on Satoshi Labs continuing to keep their site up and selling hardware.
