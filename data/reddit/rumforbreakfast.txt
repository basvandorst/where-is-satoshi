Most websites will have a method for disabling 2FA. Things like sending you an SMS code or logging a support ticket where you answer some questions.

Australia Post is pretty shit really. They're notorious for leaving cards in mailboxes instead of actually delivering parcels because it shaves time off each stop.

Two questions regarding addresses
What is the major issues regarding reusing receiving addresses? It’s often said it’s best to generate a new one each time, but if BTC is secure then where do the risks lie?
There doesn’t seem to be a DNS like solution for addresses. I’ve seen people like Andreas use a vanity address with his name in it, but is having a DNS like address like “johnsmith.btc” or whatever seems like an obvious thing to do. Is this due to a technical limitation?
