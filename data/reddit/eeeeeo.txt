my understanding is that they have sold the oil already, and once an oil rig starts you cant stop it. The problem is when businesses tries to get money sent into iran for the oild that they have sold. With banking sactions they cannot do that and therefore some of the workers arent getting paid. on top of that, few Iranians have access to CC, so if there were a right way to convert some of that money owed to oild businesses into BTC, and use those BTC to pay the workers, we would be solving 2 problems at once

i think at this point you would want someone to sit there and help people out. most the buyers are going to be first timers. it very difficult to understand public key and private key and how everything works.
im in the process of getting a bitcoin atm set up in london ontario. the process has being pretty difficult. you want to create a completely different business than the hotel one to run the atm because banks will shut your accounts down with little prior notice. youll have to get the blessing of fintract to have any chnace of opening a business account. After all that you need to register with canadian exchanges instead of US exchanges because of the legality of sending money over the boarder rather than within border.
for all the trouble above with respect to setting up a ATM, it would be understandable and worth your while to charge some service fees. Making it a Vending machine would also help along the process as money laundring would be more difficult. You would also need a system to track who have bought and how much, in case the banks come and ask for those records just to see if you are keep track of potential misuse.
pm me if you want to speak further about this, I would be happy to help you in anyway that I can!

We would be talking about a sizable amount of bitcoins. Right now a 10k btc sell on the markets would drive the price down quite a bit. Someone that would want to cash out, would probably sell a little once in a while to end up with more.
If that happens, we do have a group that seems to buy bitcoins at whatever price. Markets have memory, for some $30 is cheap, others $500 is cheap.
In the short term that might happen, but in the long run, the price will just go back up and to the moon.

I think all the major bets are in, if you take a look at crossing the chasm, contrary to what most people believe, I think with next years funding coming, we are really close to the chasm.
This means that we might be just seen price stagnation. Although if assuming bitcoin is experiencing an exponential growth, price stagnation equals more or less to price correction. 
Tax wise, I don't think people worry too much about taxes when investing, timing is more important.

In reality no, but on paper for financial purposes yes. Let's take your car rental placesfor example, they take a laon for buying cars, they buy those cars and on paper they own those cars but in reality they borrowed money to make those purchases. In a sense tthey've used their liability which is a loan, to create and asset.
 Now let's say they are a broker for car renter, and it happens a dealer would like to rent 10 cars to be then rented out separately. On the brokers account, he has 10 cars under assets, on the dealers account, when the cars are rented out by individuals, it goes under account receivable which is an asset. Hence cars now have magically appeared through the dark magic of accounting.

Optimally speaking, you'd have a pool of cash and a pool of bitcoins.
1. Someone buys bitcoins, you buy some from exchanges to restore your pool of bitcoins and make a margins.
2. Someone sells Bitcoins, you sell some btc on exchanges to restore your pool of money
3. For multiple currency, add pool of money for each pool
4. When high volatily, stop servicing.

Don't try to convince him that is it a currency, because Bitcoin is really bad as a currency right now with all the volatily. Also, concerning not back by anything, its backed by people who believe in it, for better or worse. 
Let me help you to sell a vision about the technology.
If anyone remembered their first time with a computer and internet connection, it probably wasn't all that exciting. I remember just going online and playing a game once in a while. Then came e-mails, online shopping, youtube, ebay, facebook...basically anything that can be put on the internet is on the internet. Arguably, because internet was "free". The state of information technology today exceeded most predictions than when it started in the 50's.I want to paint a picture here of the world in the next 20 years. A world where there are no ATM fees, Banking fees or Foreign exchange fees. Sending money to anyone on the planet will be as easy as sending a txt msg. For better or worse there will be no central banks where money can be printed at will. A money that does not need the backing of a government by its fire power or financial prowess. The supply is fixed, and people will be responsible for their financial mistakes if they are not careful. This money cannot be taken away from you by any means if stored correctly. This money is also programmable to the extent that you can link it to your death records so it gets passed along to your children and their children. By using it, you help others who are using it. Think money not being the root of competition, but the root of cooperation. Internet freed information so that everyone has an opportunity to acquire knowledge. Bitcoin is a step closer to freeing money so that anyone can have the opportunity to trade and prosper. Like anything in life, there is ying and yang, light and darkness, good and evil. I know that most of us are good, crazy sometimes, but good. All I have left to say is that I can't wait to come back to this post in 20 year!

Yeah I'm with you on this one, but I don't see it as a problem. I convert whatever I have in fiat after expenses to silver gold and Bitcoin. Its like finding out a cheat code in the game of life. Here are my assumptions
1. Bitcoin will be adopted enough so that I don't need fiat to live.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:06:03
Hope this helps,
Check out  print out a paper wallet.
Store your private key on a note pad and save file on a USB key.
Get a safety box or two at different bank branches, one for the paper wallet one for the USB key. 
Technically you can store it on a online file but you just need to encrypt your private key first, which can also be done with bitaddress.

Miners become bank. Right now there are less than 12m people actually owning some bitcoins. That's very very small amount. With 70% of the work unbanked, you going to make a lot more transaction cost, I'd imagine even more than 50btc per block when this thing really catches on.
Having control of a big chunk of mining would basically let you guarantee someones deposits. So Bitcoin miners are bank owners, and transaction fees are deposit insurance.

The book can be found here: 
Basically the idea is that there are: 
1. innovators: those people who bought before 2013, those who wants the tech, becasue they like new things and just want to try it out
2. early adoptors: VC, start-ups people who can link this tech to economic profit
3. chasm: this is where a lot of new tech fails
4. early majority: arguable most people got into computers when Mac and windows 98 came out. These people usually use the tech, if their friends uses it, and there are multiple source to acquire the tech. Alot of their decisions are based on referrals and who is backing who.
5. Late majority: These people are conservatives, don't like changes. These are the grandparent who goes to buy a computer and don't know why a mouse and a keyboard isn't included.
6. Laggers: these are the people who are still writing checks when they can do online banking and do credits, they hate changes.
To cross the chasm, think Apple. There needs to be an Apple solution to Bitcoin, where you can store, buy and sell and the service should be one button click.
On top of being easy to use, it needs to solve a problem that the early adopters are having. Think the rest 60-70% of the world that are unbanked. They need to get onbaord with Handheld devices first, which they will, and then Bitcoin needs to solve their banking problems, which some companies are already focusing on
Hope that helps.

Also to the point of bitcoin is never loaned out, I would like to point you to coinlenders. Furthermore to the idea that if there is a economic circumstances under which the rate of borrowing is lower than the rate of investing, or at least it is believed so, depending on ones risk profile, they might decide to borrow and invest in hope for a return.
Although such action is frowned upon by rational investors as it seems to be gambling or speculating, the outcome is not known until it happens. We win some we lose some kind a deal.

Let's say I have 1 bitcoin and you are coinbase. I give you 1 bitcoin because j trust you will be able to secure it better than I do for any reason. If there are 100 or people doing this, you now have 100 btc. Technically speaking you can now lend out those coins at a determined interest rates, whatever that might be, and also give a kick back to the person, me and others, who've banked with you. Thus giving us an economic incentive to keep our money there. Here I still have 1 btc to my name, and so does everyone else. Although on paper, the borrower also has whatever was lent to him which is the extra btc created. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 15:53:45
It's a theoretical idea that manifest itself on accounting logs. Even though the reality is that no new bitcoins are created, when you are doing accounting for financial purposes, those which are lent are accounted once by the saver as an asset, once by the bank as account payable under assets, both times as assets. In professional terms it is called asset creation.
The above is from a technical point of view. Whether this action is good or bad, usually depends on the consequences. Given the recent recession, people with hindsight which is always 20/20, mostly thinks thus is some bs. Although in foresight there have been many business who has foorished because of this principal.

You are right about 3rd world countries and wealth distribution. If you check out Ray Kurzweil, technolog/cost, increase/decrease exponentially. Eventually technology will cost less than a water bottle. 3d printer will be printing anything and everything that you want. 
For those in the 3rd world country, they have jumped from not having connection to hand held right away. Cell phone, and eventually smart phones will be cheap enough for everyone to have one, even those in the 3rd world country. Of course not Everyone is going to have a smartphone, but it's getting there!
When that happens, they will still be able to get on Bitcoin, just not as early.... I mean Bitcoin isn't end all for all solution to all the problems that our current money have, but it's a step closer towards that direction.

As an Actuary in Canada, here are my suggestions and my assumptions.
1. Steady job
2. Only stream of income of the family
3. May/may not have children
4. Mortgage payment
1. What you are doing is similar to investing at margins, which is not very good, especially if you are not an accredited investor, therefore;
2. If you can cash out even with a early withdraw penalty tax it would be better than a loan.
3. Here in Canada if you take out your pension money, you get taxed 20%, and another income tax at the end of the year. I'm pretty sure you guys would have something similar
4. Consider investing for the long run. Short term investment, especially in Bitcoins are very dangerous. As we have noticed there are more and more places that you can spend your Bitcoins. Consider not converting back in to Fiat, and just spending Bitcoins for your retirement.
*5. If you are just in Bitcoins to make a quick buck, I would suggest not investing at all, as it's more likely that you would lose money than to make profit; especially if you are investing with your retirement funds.
**6. To retire with 50-80k a year at age 65, you roughly need 1.5 million in the bank. Therefore the primary goal when considering saving for investment is protection of your principal, in your case $100k
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:18:17
I think the following model would work better as the volatility of Bitcoin is still up there.
1. model insurance rate based on actuarial properties and casualty models
2. charge premium in dollars.
3. acquire mining with premiums
4. pay loss claims with mining income stream.
This model avoids all dealings in Fiat to solve the volatility problem and also paying a premium would not require banks to do fractional reserve.
@_date: 2013-09-19 13:15:23
There seems to be a misconception about the difference between how banks create money and how the government creates money. In terms of the government there cannot be QE, or simply the printing of money to pay back debt. Although the government can decide to acquthr bitcoins and lend it out at a predetermined interest rates. As a bank, who somewhat depends on the interest rates of that the government sets, will have the ability to borrow at that rate and lend the money out on a fractional reserve basis. I.e. borrow 100, lend out 99. So in terms of bitcoins, bank gets bitcins from address 1, putting it in address 2, then lend out to you and me to put in address 3 and 4. As you can see there are no new bitcoins created, but on an accounting basis, the bank has an asset of 99 bitcoins under account receivable. We have whatever we borrowed under cash which is considered to be an asset. So if we tally up all the assets so far from the government down to us, it would be 100 for the government, 99 for the bank, and 99 for both of us combined. Essentially making the initial 100 bitcoins now accounts for 298 bitcoins on paper.
Of course this is all great and dandy if everyone makes a return. The bubble problem comes in, like you've said, when the banks aren't profecient at setting appropriate risk/interest risk, to attract and deter the appropriate borrowers. When people can't honor their debt then the banks won't get paid, which leads to the government scrambling for the bitcoins they lent out.
It is important to note that the current functions of the financial system, however illogical it maybe, was created in foresight as a great way of promoting the american dream. There are a lot of other places on earth where this not the case. Ultimately, if there is a need for a note which claims legal right to bitcoins it will be created and traded by the public. Which will in turn completely solve the loanable fund problem with the possible consequences of another bubble, but can be solved and monitored by setting appropriate risk/return levels. Not everyone fucked up the same extend as the us subprime mortgage industry.

haha you are right, it's my third language, even though most of my schooling is done in English, I seem to find my own way of explaining things lol
@_date: 2013-09-25 13:55:35
For the first point, in retorics we call it a hindsight fallacy. The idea is that in hindsight almost any sort of explanation which arrive at the current state of matter will have the illusion to be correct because the current state of matter supports the claims...which is the irony.
The second point makes illusion that there won't be a government or a system to monitor the repayment of loans. Governments will be here, bitcoin does not mean the end of the state. Before moral evolution catches up with technology evolution, there is a need to have Uncle Sam so to speak.
My point about interest rate here makes allusion to an entity. It just happens government and banks have been doing this for a while. It does not mean they will be the only one doing this. If we had enough coins, we couldn't probably start a lending service.
To build on yilour last point that only collateral is considered to be assets, there's a misunderstanding between what I would call assets, and the fact that you consider collateral to be assets. Both will run result in the same conclusion which is the fact that I'd collateral is posted, that's asset on your books, and if coins are lent out, that is also assets on his book.
Lastly I would like to point out that it seems that the underlining consequence for bitcoins success means the complete destruction of the current financial and accounting system. As wonderful as that thought may be, the truth is that those practices will be here and it will take generations to change, but while we are still alive, the rules of the game will still apply, which means there will be artificial bitcoin supply created.

the top and bottom cards never move, and at this stage, I don't think aesthetically it matters (although sorry for boring you!), it's gonna look really ugly, but I feel as long as I take out the part where previous record holder weave the cards then do a bridge to bring the cards together, I'm shaving off couple seconds.
