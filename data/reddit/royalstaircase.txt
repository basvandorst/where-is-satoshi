At this point you're just being a semantic troll and this is going nowhere. I've said everything I care to say on this matter. Have a good evening.

It's a completely different prize by a different organization that has absolutely nothing to do with the "real" Nobel Prize other than being named after Alfred Nobel. It's usually given out around the same time because it likes to pretend to be a part of the Nobel Prizes, but it's its own thing. 
But putting this name-tomfoolery aside, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics is still a very respected award that is consistently given to someone who absolutely deserves it (this year it went to Richard Thaler, one of the pioneers of Behavioral Economics, which emphasizes that humans make economic decisions based not only on mathematics, but emotions, psychology, and biases as well, and helped incorporate the field of psychology and sociology into part of the economist's toolkit.) 
And yes, theoretically you could also make an Alfred Nobel Prize in Computer Science too. It would also have nothing to do with the "real" Nobel Prizes, but if it's a well-run award people might look past the misleading name like they do for the Economics one.

This isn't a 'no true scotsman' at all. 
There is a [specific organization]( that gives out Nobel Prizes in specific categories, and none of those categories are Economics (or computer science). The economics one is "coincidentally" named after Nobel too, but it isn't a Nobel Prize. Just like how an Oscar Association of Best Sushi doesn't automatically get to say they give out "official" Oscars  that stand alongside the Academy Awards.

I have my facts mixed up upon further research, [but it still isn't a Nobel Prize]( 
Its official name is "the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel", and just gets affectionately shortened to the Nobel Prize in Economics because it wants to be a member of the clique. 
It has no association with the Nobel Foundation and isn't voted on by it. I think it's listed on their website because they know people will look for it there so they do a writeup on it too.

The Economics prize has no association with the "real" nobel association, and it's sleazy for them to ride the coattails like this, but it's still a respected prize in its own right.

Just wait until the bubble bursts and then see how James is doing.

Technology changes too. it's naive to think that someone won't someday find a crack in bitcoin's infrastructure that sends the whole thing tumbling down.
