I mean, ignoring iron, copper, lead, aluminium, zinc, lithium, nickel..
Gold isn't *that* important and not *that* rare. The special status is largely explained by history.

Yeah but even if gold was 10% of the earths crust we wouldn't make cars and buildings out of it like we do with aluminium and steel.


The definition of "precious metal" basically boils down to they are seen as valuable.


Sure, that's why the majority of gold is used for coins and jewelry and the majority of silver is used for tools, machinery, medical equipment, etc.


Literally any metal is desirable for its qualities.
