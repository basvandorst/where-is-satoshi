A whole country, arguably a top 5 or 3 market is liquidating their coins
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:50:17
It should be on the accounts tab where you see all your wallets.  You can deposit into the vault.   It takes 2 days for them to take it out of cold storage.

Actually it makes a lot of sense.

I use snake miner.  Everytime my snake eats it gets 1 Satoshi and grows longer. I still need to figure out what address its being sent to

I wouldn't rule it out.  Live 20 more years and see what body parts they can generate in a lab.  Plus, if you're hodling, maybe you can afford it.

He sounded like he had bitcoins when he was on Rogans podcast.   I raised my eyebrow at the donations as well.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:13:27
While you're deciding id at least put the majority of your hodling into the vault coinbase provides.

I also like the idea of quick transfers across borders for btc.  There are a lot of positives of btc as well as negatives.  
I do see it surviving and flourishing eventually.  There are still a lot of kinks but it has definitley opened up a new frontier on the internet and commerce.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:38:46
Its an interesting thing to watch these days. I do have some btc but I'm not heavily invested.  I still prefer traditional investments but appreciate the technology and the motive behind btc enough to root for it

I'll add to this, anyone who didn't think the CIA/NSA was doing this already is crazy out of touch and deserves what they will get.

I think you would
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:25:14
Some of the main reasons why btc is popular is because of the hatred of big banks.  
You make sense, but there will always be a demand for btc or something like btc because of how shitty the banks are.

Because the acceptance of bitcoin has given it value.  The more vendors that accept it and the more people that use it only give it more credence.  Its the same dumb explanation for why Gold or a piece of paper with a dead guy on it has value.  
More faith and acceptance =more value

Looks awesome.  Not sure if someone will be able to pay you in bitcoin though.  That's probably a good sum of bitcoin and you would have a small market to sell to.   It def would  to eliminate all the fees you'd have in a standard mortgage sale though.

Max is an idiot.  He's boys with Alex Jones.  Both love fear porn.  Alex sells you dvds and survival equiment. Max sells you gold and something he is already invested in.

Agree. I just think the technology is being showcased and if it works,  other big companies, bigger than the rumored Netflix join in

My limit is still 10 btc on coinbase. Is there a negative campaign against coinbase?
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:31:22
This is the showcase for bitcoin in 2014 I believe. If overstock can profit off this move, show that transactionss with bitcoin are smoothe and save them money off fees I think others will follow quickly. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:07:20
For a quick comparison  try to View Bitcoin as a product. It has a huge jumpstart on this new technology just like  IBM, Apple, and Microsoft. All were all first in the game for their product.  Btc has that large of a jumpstart that the acceptance will continue to make the price go up over time. More acceptance and exposure over time, the more stable it will be.  I also see the security aspect of bitcoin being a big business as well.  Technology of this caliber  rewards its firsts unless your tesla.  Theres probably more examples but you know what I mean.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:18:33
We have a long way to go until the 21 millionth coin.  I'm sure there will be a solution to the problem it comes up. 
Think about how technology has grown exponentially.   By the time that coin hits, we'll dead or immortal thru tech. We'll also be a space faring society so I'm sure we'll solve any issues with currency.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:10:38
Coinbase takes a while to get you coins you buy.  If you're sending/receiving its faster (obviously). Coinbase has to find the coins to give you which is tough when less people are selling and only 1800 coins are generated daily.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:58:20
I dont think so. Wouldn't be surprised if we dip back below 9000.  Seems thats the way these runs work.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:58:11
Sent you 3 bitcoins. Merry xmas
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:46:12
Upvoted for sanity.  Hold or buy is smart.  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.   China is scared and that's a good sign overall.  The US is afraid as well but they don't have the balls to do anything about it.  China is communist, of course they are not going to like someone threatening their system

This is the same conversation people were having two fridays ago.  I hope it drops lower so I can buy more.  There's no stopping btc.  It's only going to adapt and expand
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:20:04
Unless you're day trading or making a transaction you should hold. 
It sounds like you were wanting to buy it and keep it for an investment?  If that's the case, you need to have faith in the actual concept of bitcoin. If you had the faith to buy it at 1000, then your faith isn't that strong when you bailed quickly.  
Do you believe in bitcoin?  
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:37:16
Down again? I haven't had any problems with it. I just purchased some in the past 45 min
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:06:54
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:35:07
Its a buying oppurtunity.  If you believed enough to buy bitcoin you shouldn't sell.  China is scared of the potential of bitcoin.  Did you expect a hardcore communist country to willlingly give their people monetary freedom?
I bought today, and I'll buy more if it drops more.  You probably should sell if you have to question it.  Ye' of little faith.
