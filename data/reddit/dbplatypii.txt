156 tips and counting... 1.56 BTC. Great marketing for the cost. Cheers!

OK, so it's not hard to imagine double spends happening during a fork. This proves that as long as there is an provider willing to exchange BTC automatically, and is unaware of a fork in progress, then one can exploit the fork and double spend. This is bad, and should be fixed with a technical solution if possible. People will be looking for this in the future.
Here's another scary thing revealed by this bug however: **Causing  (intentionally) a fork is way easier than I thought!**
You don't need to control a majority of mining. All you need is to craft a block such that some large % of the mining clients will fail on it. This could be a failure at any point in the bitcoin software. If there is a size limit discrepancy between versions (in this case the DB), or maybe a unicode parsing bug in some library used, or whatever. It doesn't need to be an exploitable code bug. It just needs to cause some % of mining clients to fail and reject a particular block.
It's relatively easy to find a bug that causes some software to crash. Most of the time these bugs are minor, and don't allow any remote execution or anything, so programmers don't necessarily worry about them most of the time. But in bitcoin they could potentially cause a blockchain fork! Which could be exploited, as this incident proves.
This seems to lower the bar considerably to exploit BTC. I don't see how we can prevent this really, by design of the network.

My understanding is that this particular block got to 15 confirmations before the 0.7 chain got to be longer. If it was just about proof of work, 15 confirmations would be PLENTY.
How many confirmations would you require?

Sure, assuming you know there's a fork. I think some kind of automated fork-detection is definitely called for. But, we shouldn't put the onus on the merchants to always have a human watching.
I wonder if client diversity would help or hurt Bitcoin? Pretty much all we have is the official bitcoin client right now. Using a reference implementation to define a standard is generally a bad idea (see: web browsers). This is a case where two clients failed to implement the same protocol, and so they forked.
On the one hand, the different versions of bitcoin directly caused the split in this case. But if there were a dozen clients, based on different implementations, all running in roughly equal proportion, I expect it would be much less likely for a fork to survive as long as this one did.

More network services offered in BTC.

No. Place a bet on 75% satoshi dice. Boom! More likely to win than lose.
I get what you're saying. Expected value is negative, so every round you play will lose money in expectation. But if we're going to discourage people from playing SD, at least use legitimate arguments. SD thrives on bad math.

Storing passwords in plaintext is just bad security. It would be much better if they stored a hash of the password, or some sort of auth token.
The phone still has access to the account, so if your phone is compromised then so is the account. Whatever, there is no way around this. The difference is that with the password in plaintext, information is leaked unnecessarily. Now an attacker knows something about that user: what their password looks like. Even if they change it, that is useful information, because now an attacker knows that you like to use "correct horse battery staple" as your password pattern. Or "bl0ckcha1n". God forbid you use that password on another site. Why risk exposing this info when there is a better way?

Sigh. What you are saying is not strictly true. You can play one round of satoshi dice and have greater than 50% odds of winning some money.
It's wrong to say "you are more likely to lose than win." You need to qualify that statement (and I don't mean qualify it with your very convincing argument of "Period.")
True statements about Satoshi Dice:
**In expectation**, you are more likely to lose money than win money.
**In the long run, if you keep playing**, you are more likely to lose money than win money.

I can confirm that this works. Great Job!

Inflammatory title notwithstanding, some really good insights in the article

This makes sense as a way to check mining pool clients. Does it actually happen?

Passwords should never be stored in plaintext. There is no defensible reason to do it. At minimum, hash + salt. This is terrible security design and is never acceptable for a wallet! I expected better from blockchain. Please stop defending bad security practises.

I'm not 100% familiar with how blockchain runs their service, but for their webclient my understanding was that they never transmit your passphrase to bc.info, but rather they use some client-side javascript to process it (hash it, public key encrypt it? need to read more). That's one of the reasons everyone seems to advocate for them being the most secure of the online wallets.
It makes no sense why they wouldn't do the same on phones, when they can even do proper crypto without having to trust javascript hacks.
That being said, you're right that if they store authentication info in any form such that the user can use their wallet without entering a password, then yes, access to the phone == access to the wallet. But in my opinion it is still braindead for them to store the pass in plaintext.

What if one of the desirable properties is that the number be limited?

I've used bitcoin VPN and Usenet providers. I would like to see more services competing with the likes of amazon: VPS, hosting, domain registrars, storage (for backups, etc). 
Imagine a world where a business could operate on the internet, be paid in bitcoins by its users, and aquire the full stack of hardware and services necessary to run all in bitcoins. No identities needed anywhere.

This makes me feel MUCH safer...

That's the title of the Wired article itself, I didn't choose it. But I agree... interesting article, misleading title.
