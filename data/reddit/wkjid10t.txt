I read somewhere that this goes live in March? Does anyone know an exact date?

Are there any incentives for moderators?

How can you trust the moderator in a transaction? Are the moderators vetted?

Can moderator communicate with buyer/seller individually? If so that person can work together with a seller or buyer to scam the other. It's unlikely. But still something to think about.

Do you remember when Greece's banks refused to let people withdraw their money that belonged to them? Yeah. That same bank that has no transaction fees or whatever, it gambles your money on the market. Sure, you have to weigh the pros and cons and risk having some entity control your capital.
I've weighed the pros and cons and the risk of having some company hold on to my money isn't worth it. I am perfectly fine with taking the risk and responsibilities of holding my own capital. Many people think the same and are excited to see that a competing service is arriving. Bitcoin might not be the only system in the future, but hopefully it puts enough pressure on the existing systems to put the money back into the consumers hands.
