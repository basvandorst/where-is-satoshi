Dude yeah. Everyone wants to be the king. Deep down, Rog had to know the Wreckoning was coming. It was never about the coin as much as the implementation later &amp; after the fact. It's poetic justice really :'D

I dont either. I check on days I feel like trading, but only for conversions. You can't put a price on the Liberation of modern man for me. 10k, 20k whatevs. I HODL.

At least 5200 are on the software @  [cointracking.info

Yeah this is also what I think. The subset industry of million-dollar trash diving will be a big thing until they are all rediscovered. Like the last golden Wonka Ticket. Only, they'll sing I got a golden Satoshi.

In my personal opinion I feel like there's too many factors at play here for any one person entity or group of people to manipulate the market as a whole. Pieces yes, whole no. There's close to 8000 coins now and if Bitcoin were to crash I'm sure there's a few hundred of them would basically be the new Bitcoin in disguise, different logo different marketing similar principles and math possibly higher market cap.
Pandora's Box has already been opened and you can't stuff the new era back into it. The Liberation of modern man has already begun, and I would hardly say that any of the 0.001% could stop this train with 2 fists and a will to live imo :'D

I was wondering about this since I've been fully verified for 2 years..
I figured it was a way to slow the drip of Fiat into Bitcoin since you can add 10 grand from your bank account but it takes 7 days lulz

Haha you never go FULL fake charts! :'D

Great and interesting read.
I currently accept Bitcoin at both of my businesses, but instead of using the service I just send the person an invoice that I hand-wrote myself and they pay me directly. Now, I'm honest and I pay for the taxes from each transaction but I don't know that other people would do that given the chance.

Well then. Thats........ Yeah.
