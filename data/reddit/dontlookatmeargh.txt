If they'd be willing to meet with me that actually sounds like a good idea. If I am stymied on other fronts or the fees are bad enough with alternatives this will be something I'll look into. Thanks!

Oh good Lord, you don't think I'm stowing funds on an exchange do you? It's the ability to exchange funds for fiat and vice versa that I need, not storage solutions.
I already have accounts with Fidelity so that's an interesting point you make. I've been hearing they will be handling crypto in the near future, but hadn't heard that they were quite ready yet. But as I already have accounts with them that is a very hopeful possibility. I don't have 25M though - I'll need another big bull run for that to pan out. :-)

I would. I'm getting incredibly sick of the US government and its malfeasance and malevolence. It's costing me six figures (USD) a year in lost low-risk income opportunity just through its nanny state mentality as it is. I've been thinking of talking to my employer about setting up an overseas office and renouncing citizenship (which would have advantages for our operations for reasons unrelated to this whole topic).

By and large it's the other way around. I need to cash out for living expenses and charitable contributions.

I'll pass on the shady services. I agree about the Patriot Act though. There's absolutely no way the costs associated with the regulations and the wasted time justify any security obtained through the financial provisions in the act. I should draw up a list of all the absolutely stupid, pointless denials and arguing points raised by compliance teams lately (your passport photo's edge is trimmed (even though no info is missing and the scanner did it automatically), your address isn't on the utility bill (yes it is, spend more than 0.5 seconds looking at it), etc., etc., etc.) and turn it into a Medium article. It's not stopping any money laundering, it's just harassing citizens to no purpose.
