Sell now, buy lower.

Oh well don't have high expectations.

They are not lost. More than likely someone else knew their username and password and just sent them to their personal bitcoin wallet and now the user "lost' 6 bitcoins but really someone just took them.

So many bitcoins. I heard 18,000 so far.
20k sold now
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:22:18
There will always people ready to sell. Even if the price is in the millions.

Looks like the site is down right now. Once it is up you can see if there are sellers in your area.

Well once they are lost they are not coming back.

A repeat of April. It'll be back to normal once people stop caring about bitcoin again.

Buy more and don't look at the charts till next week.

People worried about why China is buying so many bitcoins and why their price is so high compared to other exchanges. People are just deciding to take their hundreds of thousands / millions of dollars and be happy. Once people are done selling then people will buy back in and the price will go up a few hundred.

Wait for the sellers to stop selling.

What did you have, bitcoins? They get hundreds of e-mails a day for their small team.

DDoS and bank problems.
