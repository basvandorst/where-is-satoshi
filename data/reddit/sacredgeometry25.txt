Are any of these superior to Electrum and if so, why? Thanks in advance!

Okay thanks for the reply but my balance is 0.02345493 and I am trying to send 0.022435. That leaves 0.00101993	
I can use on a fee, correct? Plus my balance is confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:57:29
Oh okay thank you.
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:14:18
Thank you for your service!
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:18:21
I have had eletrcum for years at this point? Do I need to upgrade or do anything manual on my end to switch?
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:08:13
Yeah that is very true
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:05:48
Thank you!!!
@_date: 2014-08-19 21:58:47
Wow thanks that was so fucking helpful!!! I wish I had some Reddit Gold to give out cause you would DEFINITELY get it for this comment!!
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:09:09
No I understand that he is correct but I am not going to wait that long because chances are if that ever happens again it won't be for at least a few weeks and I wanted to get some more within the week or so
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:07:58
Good point!!
@_date: 2019-03-04 01:09:17
Is there a generation that doesn't know this?
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:05:20
Ah OK I was going to say, "already?"
They'll be around one day unless the tradition really thrives.
@_date: 2016-12-12 06:21:23
Well there is your problem!
@_date: 2015-08-02 03:19:52
You're most definitely correct! :)
@_date: 2015-08-02 05:09:30
Well fuck man I hope you're all good! Stay safe brother!

So can you buy bitcoin and sell it at this ATM, or what are its functions? I am sure I am not the only one who is very curious! :)
@_date: 2015-08-02 04:30:20
Thank you for your concern but this is reddit so it really doesn't matter!
@_date: 2015-08-01 17:37:43
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:16:26
What personal info do they ask for? Just wondering, as privacy isn't a issue!
@_date: 2016-09-14 02:55:55
Is that the largest donation they have received? Looking to one up the highest donation :)
@_date: 2016-09-14 02:55:15
Please don't ever stop doing this and you have my word that in a few years I will be donating many bitcoins, thanks for what you're doing guys! :)
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:21:07
Saving up! I would love to spend a huge amount of money randomly but I currently can't afford that, but luckily that should change somewhat soon! :)

Samsung stores? Are these common? Never seen one in America before.
@_date: 2018-07-14 23:52:19
I'm going to do it right now just to prove you wrong
@_date: 2018-07-16 23:31:29
That's a fair point.
