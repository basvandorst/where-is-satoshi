It will be interesting to see what happens and also it will give you some closure in this situation.

You do because let’s say the value of bitcoin is (x) when you purchase and then when you trade for another currency it is now (y) the value change / worth needs to be noted. Then you do the same for your next transaction. Keep note of your fees as that is something you can deduct.

Long way to go. They need to fix their transaction times and fees to make people want to use it further.

Well I think the answer is simple. Try to call the number and see what happens. Who answers the phone etc. Let us know what happens :)

Haha yes, it’s a common misconception that only guys are into crypto.

I’m new to all this, I applied for Independent reserve. I went to the Coinspot Facebook page to see what people are saying and a few people mentioned that if the banks were a problem then you could still deposit cash at the news agency, but apparently that’s not allowed too. So it sounds like maybe Coinspot has issues with their bank and not the clients? Also a few people said they called their banks before sending any money to make sure their accounts wouldn’t be closed and their banks said they don’t have coin spot “black listed” or anything like that. However, POLi payment method is what banks have an issue with as you are giving your bank log in details and passwords to a third party- which voids any liability of the banks as you willingly give that info out. I’ll check out btc markets. I was just looking at low fees and a place to buy crypto to get in.

What exchange do you use in Australia?
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:12:47
Any exchange is realising a taxable transaction/event. So say you have bitcoin, you make some transactions- that’s all taxable events. If you want the long term capital gains to be applied- at some point you need to hold and withdraw a year later. Depending on where you are in the world will depend on how much tax you have to pay because there is a difference between short term capital gains and long term. Some countries only give you a 50% discount if it’s long terms vs short term. Always keep a ledger of all your transactions and fees associated with that. If they want to audit, they need all that info and the onus is on you to provide the info should it ever be requested.

That explains it :) Happy trading!

Not exactly; their statement and the tweets they used as proof all insinuate that the banks are closing customer accounts who try to transfer their money into an exchange in order to purchase bitcoins. They nowhere said themselves that their own banking is the issue specifically.

I don’t think you can ever define a number since every bitcoin owner has the ability to trade at any time and someone holding it indefinitely is not guaranteed

How did you get blocked? What was your exact method of payment?
