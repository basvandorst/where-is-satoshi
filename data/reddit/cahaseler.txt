Just saying that if the AMA has unnatural voting patterns because of this post, then people are liable to lose accounts. Not in my control, just seen this shit happen before. If you come across the AMA naturally and vote as you would, you should be fine.

Mods can't really see more than users. We've got to be clever about it, if we see a post on here linking to the AMA telling everyone to upvote it, we'll have some pretty clear proof. We saw some of that last week with the Elon Musk AMA.
Otherwise it's up to the admins for more detailed stuff. They can see that you're a subscriber here who viewed this post, or any number of other factors which could lead them to believe you're up to no good. Especially if you do obviously bad stuff.

IAMA mod here - yes, it is, and if people follow this guy's advice, there are gonna be a lot of bans and shadowbans.
EDIT: What did I fucking tell you?

Try nicehash. Pays you directly in btc, saves the bs of selling the small amounts you'll make and losing it all to transaction fees.

Then it should be:
total current value - total value at start of year - total new investment = profit, no?

Yea it's the money in his checking account he needs to worry about after giving it to visa/coinbase.

Total current value in dollars - total investment in dollars = profit.
