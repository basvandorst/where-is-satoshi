I'm sorry, but this answer in itself is just idiotic. You are telling us "we didn't have a 36% cut, but we could have put nothing, or any other number." 
And then you are surprised that people are pissed? You are being deliberately shady.

Who said he doesn’t? I do for example. Do you?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:10:35
I know, it sucks. I’ve been involved since 2011 and it saddens me to see such a huge potential wasted on egos and self-gain-oriented fights

When you are the few “allowed” developers of a project that has a daily market cap of ~235 BILLION dollars, then you can’t act like amateur hour and not provide timelines. BTC at the moment is broken (fees and congestion), and “features will come eventually” is not an answer that we should accept
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:37:10
And that is acceptable to you? 
“I’d like to purchase that item, I’d better start checking the mempool for the next two weeks so I can pay a fee that’s maybe less than the value of the object I’m buying or... oh they accept credit cards and I cna buy it now? Sweet”

I’ve been a coder since 12, and im in my 30s now. Worked as developer since 18, opened 2 startups and two businesses, and CTO of all of them. I know how open source works, since I push merge requests daily to several OSS. Having said that, an open source project is not a democracy. Only selected few people (devs with commit rights) can push changes, no matter how many people send merge requests.
Buggy should be denied, but any other conversation has been denied too. Draconian methods don’t help anyone.


Not once I attached you personally. Stop trying to lower the level of this discussion by going for ad-hominem unfounded attacks.


I’ve been around BTC since 2011, and I heard that timeline from the devs several times, be it in the bitcoin forums or at conventions. So stop that retorica. They did have uncertain timelines like that, and they still do for the other future upgrades. A revolutionary piece of technology that should take over the world financial systems should have deadlines like “Q1-2018” etc. If we allow them to behave like an high school project, we’ll never get to replace anything.
Anyhow, I came here to have a discussion, and so far you insulted me by assuming I’m a rbtc fanboy, not a coder, not understand OSS, and bullshiting. This is the reason why we (as in,  BTC) got to this situation: toxicity instead of open dialog.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:32:11
By allowed I mean it as that you, and I, and anyone else beside a selected group of people can’t make any changes to the code. So, we are at their whims, schedules,etc. 
BTC is massive, and if you don’t know what “market cap” means, I’ll dumb it down for you: a lot of money. More than the GDP of Portugal. It’s unacceptable that we have no timelines when there is so much money in/around the project.
The block size debacle has been going on since 2013, in one way or another. Timelines for lightening have always been “soon”, “18 months” etc.
And in your reply you are eager to:
- Tell me to fuck off (great toxic way to have a discussion)
- Blame others (Ver, etc) for.. spreading lies, I guess?
The only ones to blame for the situation we are in are the devs. They are in control of the code, they only can steer the ship, or other coins will keep on popping (and it will hurt adoption).
A solution has to be chosen FAST because BTC (and crypto) are finally getting mainstream momentum, but fees of 40$+ are just ridiculous.

Yep, of course, only 19 exclusive (and working for blockstream &amp; co) developers in the world are able to understand the intricate code of bitcoin!! No one else!! They said it!! /s
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:09:24
yeah, it looks ok now. I'm the creator of MyAltcoins.com and it was giving a lot of issues to all my users
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:29:34
I'm the creator of MyAltCoins, let me know of any feature you'd like to see.
PS: remember that the site is 100% free
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:16:22
It's not just limited to cryptos tho, it has BTC stock prices too
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:09:32
I'm getting the same problem even with the API. Anyone having the same issues?
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:18:22
:-) No need to go thru my history. The site has no access to your wallets. It's just an easy way to store your transactions and see what your profit/losses are in real time
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:36:57
Can you tell me what you'd like to have more explained?
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:11:06
Yeah, I need to take care of the homepage... i just suck at design :D Thanks for the feedback tho
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:36:34
That does sound interesting... complex but interesting :) I will think on it
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:42:22
Damn it, PM me your username and i'll see what's happening
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:11:50
Are you sure? mine is updating if i refresh any time there is a change in the exchange rates (every 5 minutes)
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:14:32
For any questions/improvement request/bugs etc, I created the subreddit I'd love to hear what the community thinks of the site
@_date: 2019-10-20 15:04:14
So, you are timing the market when “it falls of 5-10%”. And “because of their IQ”.. really? Condescending much?
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:44:01
Give it few minutes and it will be [deleted]
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:11:06
That's the problem: being patient is worth if progress is being made. So far we have a Core team holding the code hostage, and unable (or mostly, unwilling) to open their eyes and see that this is a massive issue. Fees are high, that's a fact. And they are high just because of their choices, not for impossible technical or technological reasons.
Bitcoin is/was the king, and to keep it up and succeed in the original idea, we all need to work together and admit there is a problem. There are no sides, and the table is much smaller than you think it is, so instead of pushing people like me away, try to listen to the problem instead of dismissing it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:40:26
Comments like yours are the reason why Bitcoin is in the middle of a stupid internal war.
It's 2017, having a payment system that is fast (instant even), secure, and decentralized is not impossible. Hell, look at Ethereum, they did it. So stop defending the flaws of Bitcoin by trying to pass them as features. Bitcoin is slow and expensive right now, that's not a good thing, no matter what the white paper said or what moral high ground you want to use.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:51:27
I've been in the crypto world since 2012, built mining rigs, built the original MyAltCoins.com (used daily by thousands of people), and I'm now richer thanks to BTC/Alts. Oh well, I guess I'm still dumb if I try to have a dialog with you 
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:07:01
It does not, and I never claimed to be. You are the one spouting orders, telling people to leave and that everyone but you is dumb. I, tho, am a business owner and a member of society, and can tell you that high fees and behavior like yours are what's keeping bitcoin from wide adoption. 
We should be welcoming people, not try to send them away. Btw, ever stopped and thought "man, a lot of people on those other subs are upset about this. Maybe there is something to it?"
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:03:54
There is really no way it can hurt you. It's a website where you manually input the transactions you had so you can keep track of them (read the faq if you can, it kinda explains it better)
