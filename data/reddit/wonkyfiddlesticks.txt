what if I don't want to use phone? It's incredibly prone to hacking. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:25:09
why? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:31:26
So paper wallet sounds awesome, as I think everyone should be very weary of hacks at this point. Nothing is secure, so would love to just have a paper wallet, but how you can you buy/sell with just that?

This doesn't work when you have institutional investors in play. One private equity firm can have more invested than 1000s of people. Which means even if 10x more individual people adopt, but fewer institutional investors do it won't grow (or vice versa).

Umm... what? Institutional investors are keeping the price this high for this long based on the new futures. Not to mention that the notion of Bitcoin as currency is increasingly distant given the higher and higher transaction fees.

Potentially, sure. I just mean that this "law" is moot in this particular instance
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:11:23
but I don't currently have a wallet or account anywhere
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:56:52
uh... no, not even close. Real super cars are $1mil each. Mansions cost 2 - 20 million to start with. Private jets? Maybe to get a ride for a vacation, but certainly not to own or even lease. 
Don't get me wrong, $25 mil is a hell of a lot of money, but it's not buy everything you want money.

who cares? are you kidding? In what universe are 10% fees acceptable for buying any kind of investment vehicle?

Where can I get a paper wallet from? Only the physical ATMs? With a paper wallet, how do you make purchases? Who keeps the details of the paper wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:13:26
... no. It's 1 single user with massive buying power. Totally different than many individual users. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:44:42
... and moving the goal posts. So I'll take it you finally understood how you were wrong? 
That's also a silly argument. The whole notion of BTC's value is scarcity. There will only ever be so many BTC, which is why the value is expected to grow over time. Now, if miners stop mining, guess what happens? Scarcity increases, value increases. 
Guess what happens when value increases? Miners start mining again! 
That's why BTC is so awesome, purest supply/demand economics.

... Okay. You're either a troll or reeaally not getting this. 
Let's say you have $1,000 a month to spend on either mining or buying 1 Bitcoin. 
You can either spend that money gradually over the course of the month paying for electricity, along with the time to mine that coin. Or you can just chill the whole month, then take 30 seconds to buy it. Either way you end up with 1 BTC at the same exact time, and either way that 1 BTC will be worth the same exact amount 10 years from now. 
The only difference is how much it costs in money and effort vs. how much a BTC costs on the market. For some people, it'd be worth it if they can save $10 (or mine $10 worth more BTC) for others that threshold is higher. 
But you're still comparing apples to apples, so future cost DOESN'T MATTER. Now, if the comparison was between mining BTC and buying gold, then yes of course the future value plays a big deal. But not when you're talking about mining BTC vs. buying BTC because future value is exactly the same. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:02:37
OMG. Please, please tell me you're just trolling and aren't this stupid. 
You buy it at dollar value when it doesn't make sense to mine even if it's less i.e. $950 to mine vs. $1,000 to buy. But if the cost of mining stays the same, and the CURRENT value of BTC increases dramatically then obviously it's more worth it to mine. I.e. $950 vs. $2000. 
As long as the increases to cost in mining outpace the increase in cost of buying BTC then it makes more sense to buy. If the BTC cost of buying starts to outpace cost of mining, then it makes more sense to mine.
How hard is this to understand? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:24:12
... and you don't need to predict them. You simply turn the mining on or off. Your friends might've been right in 2013, it just depends on what the costs were THEN. Because, again, if you mined 1 BTC in 2013 or if you bought it in 2013, it would be worth exactly the same amount today. The only question would be if you could get more BTC from mining or from buying relative to your initial capital available for investing.

My friends and I launched a startup. It crashed and burned, but we did get a $1,200 check. Because we don't have a physical location, and just a mailbox address (we're purely an online company) every bank we've gone to just refuses to open an account for us. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:40:15
Yeah, so what's gonna happen here is that worst case scenario fewer coins get mined. In which cases supply is shrunk, while demand increases. Price increases, miners are attracted back rinse and repeat. 
Not sure what the thought process was here. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:58:05
uhh, you still don't seem to get it.
The benefit of mining isn't the long term growth, because buying a bitcoin would enjoy the same long term growth.
Rather what you should look at is the cost &amp; effort of mining vs. cost of buying.
 Using your numbers: $50 in electricity costs &amp; some effort vs. $60 - 70. if that's a trade-off you're comfortable with then sure! But what happens if electricity goes up a little and it starts requiring more effort to mine and that profit margin gets narrower.
