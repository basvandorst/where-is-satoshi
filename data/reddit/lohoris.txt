I've just sent them this email
It works basically like paypal: they'll accept BTC from users, and will hand you USD, so that you don't have to bother with actually receiving BTC.
Either that, or you don't really need money as you claim.

1. fine
2. And what would you have suggested instead? He clearly explained that if he didn't do so, most users would just withdraw 100% and others would remain empty handed. Do you seriously honestly think this would have been better?
@_date: 2014-01-21 13:51:27
The linked "article" is just a few lines with no reference... quite disappointing.
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:09:05
And that's basically what he said he was doing, except the site would still run – but you would have been free to withdraw.
(of course none of this might be happening because he might just be scamming, but that's another matter)

The Rock Trading.
Started using it years ago, and coming back recently they are still as active, professional and quick as they were before.
Staying in business and keeping high standards seems to be most difficult in the bitcoin world, and they are doing an excellent job at that.

Sure, but the "provably unfair" claim is so fun that as a token of appreciation I sent this small "bet", which basically is actually a tip.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:27:18
Oh, fine, the way it was written, it looked like you had to manually link files there in order to sync them...
@_date: 2013-07-21 08:50:20
I don't see how this would be better: you would still be buying from a shady source a steam wallet card, and they might decide to crackdown that too.
Unless they already stated that it's fine, of course.

Then his involvement in Litecoin is irrelevant, like the thread title suggested instead.

Well, AFAIK ancient Chinese paper money was actually worth nothing. At least, that's what Wikipedia told me, and wiki doesn't lie, right?

I fail to understand if this post is ironic or serious :V

I suggest against mtgox price, which is inflated due to them having huge problems.

"creator" of Litecoin.
Did Coinbase need an expert at copypasting?

Aahahhahaah rofl thx
@_date: 2013-08-04 11:24:13
Not even trying isn't a smart move.
And anyway, they don't really have to understand bitcoin, the situation is pretty simple: you ordered something, you paid, you got nothing. Not rocket science.
@_date: 2013-07-31 09:10:35
But the same exact thing happens with stocks.

You should not keep BTC there unless you are actually trading them.

They have cash, but most likely not enough to refund everyone or build what they owe.

This site is UTTER CRAP.
If you want something which does that, but in a sane way, use 
The problem with that SHIT is that knowing that "for them" is down means nothing: the problem might be their side too, or it may be affecting a big chunk of the Internet but not everyone. The way to do that, instead, is to check from several locations and compare the results, which is what host-tracker does.
Please please please STOP spreading that horrible site, it's a plague. It has a catchy name. Still it sucks hard asses. Stop it.
@_date: 2013-08-03 21:48:40
And that's "misleading" to say the least.
So if your goal is to scam your customers into buying at a worse price thinking they got a nice price, go on with that... otherwise, use a real price.

Oh I didn't know ThePiachu was a mod here, nice.
I didn't notice theymos was mod either, less nice.

Quite ironic that turned out the problem wasn't the online wallet but the local one...

The average user shouldn't use *cash* either?

Much lol, I just [had]( to, even if it meant paying for the transaction fee 5x the amount of the transaction, lol.

Obviously not.

It says "without the prior written consent" or something like that. I.e. he *might* get the consent, if he wanted to.

It was good for its intended audience: whiny kids who wanted to "play miner" with their hardware, and couldn't do that with Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2013-07-21 08:48:35
Yes, this is my concern too. According to this article, Valve is already aware of this and apparently they are still up, but it's quite vague on this matter.
They should really write something about that in the FAQ.
@_date: 2013-07-30 13:55:10
Thinking this is a flaw is an incredible misunderstanding.
It's not a flaw: it's a characteristic. Which is good in some occasion, and bad in others. But you can't eat your cake and have it.
@_date: 2013-07-19 16:27:15
I didn't find it confusing at all, but maybe that's because I already know what it is talking about.

So what? Barter exists, doesn't really matter if you send them seashells or whatever: you sent, they didn't.
But if you really dislike getting your money back, fine.

You pay it and it doesn't even come out-of-the-box with a cloud sync? srsly?
