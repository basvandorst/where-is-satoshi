If you make sure that none of your orders execute when the market is green and rising, slippage is less likely. 
I had no idea buying in NZ was so tricky. I have friends in central america who are doing the same thing as you with websites that take VISA.

Do you understand what a decentralized permissionless cryptocurrency is? 
You can only regulate locally, and btc is worldwide. This can't be regulated nice and pretty like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have never collapsed since their creation because regulation makes things safer.

Every damn crash people like you come out. Let's see:
"past performance does not guarantee future results"
"tulips/ponzi comment"
Meanwhile everyone who understands what's happening is accumulating quietly before the next bull run. I hope it comes to 2k. It probably won't but if it does I will buy a long with many others. The patterns do repeat themselves.

Cool story... we're talking about the exchanges, which you can block individually country by country until you start finding countries that won't block those exchanges because they create partnerships with the exchanges.

Dude if you've been in this space long enough, you should know that the HODL mentality is useful because people don't know where the bottom is. Sell at 6k, and it never goes back down again, and you'll never be able to have a full bitcoin. If it indeed goes back down below 6k, then you can buy more btc. 
Myself, and many people, HODL a certain amount of btc, and sell a certain amount hoping it goes down, but the risk with bitcoin is towards the upside. What will you say if it goes to 80 and crashes to 30k?
BTC crash cycles are a game of musical chairs. Once a bottom has firmly been established the music turns on again, and then the question is what's the top? Then it crashes. And we rinse and repeat. 
Everything in life is a "ponzi scheme" by your definition. Used car dealerships? ponzi schemes. They're just trying to sell them for more than what they bought them for. New car dealership? Ponzi scheme. Any store ever? Ponzi scheme they are just trying to make a profit. 
Do you know a lot of people trying to sell their houses for less than what they bought them for?
Buying low and selling high is not a ponzi scheme.

No need to sigh. Fundamentally speaking, not your keys, not your coins. This concept is seemingly lost on so many. MtGox was not in the business of providing custodial services for crypto. That exists now. MtGox was created originally to trade cards. 


So some people, lost their funds while trading crypto on a website designed for trading cards almost a decade ago when the tech was in it's infancy.  That's your scary story?
Pirate Bay is still easily accessible, and it's impossible to shut down. That's your example?
Your scary liquidity stories don't scare me either. There will always be a market that doesn't conform to your regulations. It's called jurisdiction shopping, nothing new.

What's your source on this?
There will be 55 million job openings in the economy through 2020: 24 million openings from newly created jobs and 31 million openings due to baby boomer retirements. 
By educational attainment:
 • 35 percent of the job openings will require at least a bachelor’s degree; 
• 30 percent of the job openings will require some college or an associate’s degree;
  • 36 percent of the job openings will not require education beyond high school.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, The Economics Daily, ***69.7 percent*** **of 2016 high school graduates enrolled in college.**
More people are going to have degrees and will be competing for the same positions.

I don't think you understand Bitcoin, keeping in mind Bitcoin Is Hard to Understand because it's at the crossroads: 
1. Cryptography 
2. Computer networking and data transmission 
3. Game theory 
4. Economic and monetary theory 
You think btc has it's incentives somehow misaligned in this environment? This environment where companies routinely jurisdiction shop for the most favorable position to amass the most amount of profit, as fast as possible.. and do so legally.. you think btc, mining operations and exchanges will somehow conform? 
You can be any of these things...

* early adopter
* C-level exec

The thing about btc is as a unit of account it's almost flawless. 
US dollars are so easy to forge, and create out of thin air. 
More people are realizing this and buying btc in small amounts with money they don't mind losing, which is holding fiat accountable. 
I DCA, through limit orders. Some of my orders are fantasies, like buying 1btc @ 1k, but some are now more plausible like buying 0.1 btc @ 3300. Set your less likely and bigger (in fiat amount) orders at the bottom, smaller (in fiat) more probable orders at the top. 
This is just getting started. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:47:04
Some people are.
And some people are buying because there will always be more dollars... and if bitcoins can't be forged then we have a hedge. 
And some people are buying because they want to make a profit
And some people are buying because their country's currency is collapsing like in Venezuela.

@_date: 2018-12-07 01:07:19
Yeah exactly!
Bitcoin will dwindle to 0 because the Fed and all central and commercial banks of the world are solvent and they won't issue any new debt.
The global financial system is not fragile, 2008 was just a hiccup and all those structural problems were corrected by honest politicians and honest lobbyists.

@_date: 2018-12-05 03:49:18
The way btc works is it pumps to a crazy number, and crashes to 50-90% of that value, and stays there until the next pump.
What's pumping is the amount of central bank issued fiat papers, also known as dollars, euros, yuan, pesos, whatever.
Btc will never stay down for "10 years" because the halving happens every 2 years. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:29:11


People invest in the economy to get more dollars. Nobody cares about stimulating business, because if that were the case private equity wouldn't buy companies, load them up with debt and pillage the companies.
Btc isn't special, except that it can't be forged as easily as dollars. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:22:33
You must not be very familiar with how Private Equity acquires more $. 
They don't give a fuck about stimulating business. They want to stimulate their pockets.

It's the other way around. People are leaving their nation's currencies as they devalue towards sound money like btc. 
There are so many dollars circulating they are increasingly worth less, because of scarcity. There will always be more dollars. Always.
@_date: 2018-12-17 03:46:45
In the short term the price might increase, but I see it more so from the point of view that fiat purchasing power is collapsing worldwide.
I'm not married to the idea that btc needs to replace VISA or MasterCard by the year 20xx, and thus I don't think that adoption necessarily is going to come from people spending their btc online to buy a widget. 
I'm more attached to the concepts of wealth sovereignty and sound money, and I think adoption will come from the masses calling the banks on their bluff.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:52:05
I can easily forge a Monopoly currency. 
How do you forge a btc, besides using a 51% attack which at this point is virtually impossible?
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:16:39
Btc clearly doesn't that's the whole point. How is it going to drop to 0? Did you develop a quantum computer that breaks btc?
If you didn't develop a quantum computer then you must have a lot of hardware in your basement for a succesful 51% attack?
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:49:30
Btc isn't just a currency, and you can't look at it as just a currency because it's like looking at 3d object and only describing 2d properties.
Game theory, Cryptography, Computer networking and data transmission, Economic and monetary theory. It's something else entirely. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:13:27
The way btc works is people accumulate when people like you are saying "if it ever comes back".
Then once it's at some crazy number and all over the news, people like you say it's a "bubble and tulips" and then the price crashes to a lower high. 
We are still talking 3k  for a magical internet money, that either says the btc is a worthwhile investment, or dollars are just so worthless that's what they'll buy you. 
If dollars were so powerful, 1 dollar would buy you 100 bitcoins. They don't.
Watch the game of btc musical chairs. We all accumulate quietly for 10 -14 months after a crash and let it rip. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:02:21
The house always has an edge in the casino.
Investing in btc doesn't. 
Here you could average down increasingly until the sell pressure has ended. 
More importantly you only invested 800 at 16.7k, which means if you just buy in small amounts as it's going down your average cost also goes down.
This tech is going nowhere, the cat is out of the bag nobody trusts the banks anymore.

Except the way the world works nowadays is an exaggerated version of first mover advantage:
First-mover advantage (FMA) is the advantage gained by the initial ("first-moving") significant occupant of a market segment. First-mover advantage may be gained by technological leadership, or early purchase of resources.
A market participant has first-mover advantage if it is the first entrant and gains a competitive advantage through control of resources.[1] With this advantage, first-movers can be rewarded with huge profit margins and a monopoly-like status.
Btc was the first successful one, strongest hashpower and most minds all across the world trying to improve it and/or hack it.

My average cost was just over 6k. As it started going over 10k I was selling and setting orders at 5k and below. 
All of my 4k-5k orders hit and I still have stuff in the 2k-3k range.
Gambling isn't the right word to use. In gambling the house always has an advantage. Here the ledger is transparent and the rules are very clear. It's more satisfying to have more btc, than it is to have more dollars. I don't believe in fiat currencies long term.  
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:26:35
I believe people will increasingly look at the global financial system and demand something more transparent and accountable. How can you make sure some random person isn't forging whatever fiat you love and debasing your currency?
Unless someone just developed a quantum computer i'm not worried. And if they did develop a quantum computer, it wouldn't just be btc's network that would be at risk to hacking.

Less incentive to be spent? 
Where did you get that idea?
Bitcoin's main network isn't ideal as a payment layer because of the 10min block times. But that's what the LN is for. 
The lightning network is growing FAST. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:08:47
This is happening everywhere. Any country that "bans" crypto is in essence just promoting mining operations to bribe local officials. Local officials make peanuts in these countries, and they will take the money and look the other way. 
All of btc's incentives are right. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:52:51
There will always be more fiat than btc. 
Unless you've developed a quantum computer that can break btc the trend towards btc increasing in value in terms of fiat will continue.

If our orange president just declared *~~falafel~~* fatwah on brown people he wouldn't have to put up a wall, but unfortunately stable genius doesn't know magical incantations. 
The only magical incantation DJT knows is **Riddikulus** sanktion leviosa, by why sanctions are imposed on a country and once this happens, life in that country will cease to be worth living.

It's easy to just measure things in respect to the best they've ever been, but it's not a true representation of reality. 
Btc is accumulated through a period of 12-15 months, when people are bashing it constantly. 
For example AMZN stock peaked at $2039 and is right now at $1591 that's a 33% drop, but people aren't "leaving" the "buying amazon stock space" anytime soon. 
People are probably trying to acquire more Amazon stock because their belief in lord Bezos and the fundamentals haven't changed.
The cool thing about btc is nobody has to buy 1 whole btc, it can be done in the smallest of amounts, which makes it much more democratic and accessible than buying one AMZN stock at $1.6k . 
Can we talk again in 10 months?
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:59:57
Right now mc/visa have advantages that btc doesn't, but that may not be the case in the future.
Furthermore there are things that btc does that mc/visa can't do right now, and will never be able to do.
Btc is uncensorable transactions. Mc/visa is fully censorable. 
Furthermore there will only be 21 million btc, and that's not the case for visa and mc. So comparing them doesn't cover all the bases. Btc is a whole other animal.
