I couldn't get in either.  I replied to the email and cc'd at least 3 other emails I knew of there; no response but emails didn't bounce either.  
Kinda moronic of them to ask everyone to confirm - but not provide steps as to how.  They had to know their web site would get blitzed.

Yeah finally got in.  Clicked accept and got a window that said "some text here".  Lol.    Hoping that did it.

Between 5.5-5.9GH/s, 7 x 7970, 8 x 6670,  0 on my BFL single that will probably be obsolete by the time I receive it.

Quotes from a google search - 
"Banks must notify the government any time they receive more than $10,000 in a single deposit. They must also report withdrawals of that size, or anyone using that much cash to buy a negotiable instrument such as a cashier's check or a bank draft. This rule applies to American dollars and to foreign currency worth more than $10,000. It also kicks in if the bank receives multiple payments from the same agent or individual over the course of a year adding up to more than $10,000. Banks don't have to report personal checks, regardless of the amount.
Suspicious Activity Reporting
The federal government requires banks to report smaller transactions that may be a sign of suspicious activity. Federal guidelines say suspicious activity could include a deposit or withdrawal of $5,000 or more by a customer who doesn't normally make transactions that big. Banks may also report transaction that fall just under the BSA's $10,000 limit or that have no "apparent lawful purpose," just to be on the safe side of the law. Critics of the law say the standards for suspicious activity are far too vague to be effective.
Other Businesses
The Bank Secrecy Act affects any business that deal with a transaction or series of transactions for more than $10,000. If a customer buys an item such as a $12,000 boat or a $15,000 antique with cash, the dealer has to report the sale. Businesses do not have to report the transaction if the customer uses a negotiable instrument -- a cashier's check or traveler's check for example -- with a face value greater than $10,000. If a buyer pays with a $2,000 traveler's check and $8,000 in cash, they need to report the sale to the government.
Banks and businesses must file a form 8300 within 15 days after receiving the $10,000-plus payment. If the customer makes multiple smaller payments, the 15 days countdown starts as soon as the total paid exceeds $10,000. The bank or its parent must notify the person who made the transaction that he's been identified in the report, provide a contact number for follow-up questions and state the total amount of cash involved. Notification doesn't have to go out until Jan. 31 of the year after the company filed the 8300."

Good advice.   I could've cashed out a week ago and been fine for at least the foreseeable future..even if it drops 50% in value I'm good..but I am curious to see where it goes.  Going to cash in some of it though to hedge my doubts..but I've seen some people that really deserved a good break come out way ahead in all this and I keep telling them not to make stupid mistakes and squander it.

I've been told recently by a gentleman I've spoken with on the phone on a few occasions that unless there are any other unforeseen interruptions in their supply chain, or due to other unforeseen circumstances, that I could reasonably expect to see my 60-now-50GH/s miner that I ordered in January (my order # is in the 16000's for comparison) arrive anywhere from mid-July to early August.   Don't hold me or them to it as it will probably change next week, but that's the info being given, presently at least.   So extrapolate from that what you will.  If you order now you'll probably receive sometime between December and your death.

So glad I shifted all my btc to bitfloor yesterday.  I am so tired of this bullshit.    
I don't fault MtGox for this, as anyone in this position would have found it extremely difficult to handle the explosive growth they've seen lately..but enough is enough.  Time to spread the eggs among multiple nests.

I meant those that I'm trying to sell.  I keep most of mine offline in paper wallets.

I would be willing to be that in the short term (within the next 6-12 months) we're going to see a slightly higher than average price climb.  Why?  As more ASIC miners hit the network, it will become harder for non-asic miners to make a profit, and it will make more sense to simply purchase bitcoins than to mine them.    Throwing money at electricity and GPUs will no longer be a viable solution for mining; it's barely viable now.  
As ASIC miners become more mainstream and readily available, the prices of that hardware will begin to fall and eventually the BTC market price will return to the norm (if there is such a thing with BTC).    Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

I sold a small percentage of mine off because I knew that the bubble would burst at any given time.  I sold before the high but I still recouped far more than my initial investment.  
The rest I'm putting away for a rainy day, keeping a mindful eye on it like I do the rest of my portfolio.

Yep same here, bought BTC from them last week, had them in my account today even with the increase.  I've not had any problems with them whatsoever, but then again I typically buy in small amounts.

Eligius seemed to take a hit about the same time but recovered quickly.  Bitminter doesn't seem to be affected at all.

If you want it to succeed, do not use anything that has the words bit, coin, virtual, crypto or digital.  Sorry, but nothing will scare away non-tech savvy people faster.
Instead use words that appeal to the general populace, words that imply trust, security, solidity, stability.
Just a few off top of my head-
Freedom International
First Global / Global First
Criterion International  or 1st Criterion
Exemplar Bank or First World Exemplar Bank
Probity Equity International (ok so it had the word Bit in it, couldn't resist)

i went to bed with bitcoinity tabbed in my browser and my speakers on.  I was awakened around 6am this morning with liza minelli singing money money money money money money money.... and me scrambling to find out just where tf it was coming from.   Well played, bitcoinity.

Paper wallets.  I can't stress this enough.  Only keep active online what bitcoins you plan to sell/exchange and keep everything else offline.  It only takes losing your entire wallet once to really burn this in.
