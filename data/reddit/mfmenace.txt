You use this app called coinbase which basically manages all the investments you make and profits that you gain. You may buy or sell on coinbase as you please. A $50 investments will increase but at a very slow rate. The more you invest, the more you will see gain. Once you've gained a good amount and you are thinking of selling, there is an option in coinbase that says "sell" which will then ask for the amount you would like to sell in all. There will be an option to send the money you've invested/profited directly to your bank account, whether it is Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc.

Dammit. Okay thank you! I appreciate it

Bitcoin!!!! I just want to be rich. Filthy filthy rich. So filthy that I smell like semen, mud and musty vagina on top of the street where my ancestors used to live. However, uncle tom did not agree to make a kite with his son, so he decided to buy him toys instead. Samantha, Tom's sister, decided one evening that he was going to play bingo. Tom was afraid that if he were to lose, he would not be able to win the championship. The next day, Samantha and Tom went out for a drive and stopped to grab a bite. The end.

Does anyone know if it costs anything to deposit usd money from your bank account into the coinbase USD account? 
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:53:02
It'll be at 8k by the end of today
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:18:35
Lol April? Yeah right. You're talking about next year.

Oh boy did he! The unicorn was a bit challenging, but that was not an issue for the Pink T-Rex, as the blue whale had given him support. Such an astonishing way of helping someone else isn't it? No excuse for the brown turtle. He could have done so much better in these circumstances.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:33:21
Lol I like that. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:47:02
I'm just asking idiot. I wasn't planning on selling you scrub
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:44:05
Being at 7k is so depressing. Makes me feel hopeless in a sense. I will HODL no matter what though. Something this unique was not created for no cause.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:41:08
*Can someone please be nice and explain how the price will eventually go back up? What if no one cares about crypto currency? I mean half of the world still doesn't even know about it or cares to even put money into it, so how will the price rise? People keep saying the price will skyrocket within a couple months but HOW???? What if everyone stops believing in Bitcoin and sells everything. Bitcoin is not even being brought about, mainstream wise, so how will others wants to invest in it? I keep thinking that no one will want to put their money into it because they think it is a scam or just simply because they need their money rn and they don't want to waste their time.*

Thanks for your reply. Hopefully coinbase does not charge me. We shall see.

@_date: 2018-02-02 04:59:25

@_date: 2018-02-02 05:54:33
Oh. I haven't heard his new album. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:43:02
Bitcoins dead ��
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:35:47
It was clearly a joke. Go play your drums
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:24:27
Honestly I'm pretty over this whole Bitcoin getting rich shit. Once it hits 12k I'm out. Tired of that shit going up and then sinking faster than my cum dripping out my girls vagina. Sucks I had so much faith in this BS but all of a sudden we cannot get out of this loop. 8k-10k is where we have been stuck for the last couple months. Tired of that.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:32:12
Everyone needs to sell now. The end of Bitcoin is now. Even the Bitcoin millionaires agreed that this is the end of bitcoins run. There's an end to everything always.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:46:45
Everyone who is making the price go down 
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:41:06
Everyone's selling. People want out now. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:36:15
Lol just sell. Everyone wasting their time.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:58:51
A long with your grammar and your soul. You scrub.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:11:33
What. In the actual fuck. Is that. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:41:25
Damn straight 
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:19:25
I didn't even bother losing my money you poor human. ��
@_date: 2018-04-02 05:33:09
Bitcoin will crash now even more due to the 128 tariffs China has recently rolled out. Stock markets will ��
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:08:33
So we're going to be stuck in the same loop for maybe about a year or so. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:25:30
I really hope you're right.
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:07:19
You're the zombie you pathetic little butthurt scrub
@_date: 2018-04-01 06:28:02
I feel your frustration. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:05:28
Everyone please sell. You're wasting your time. Bitcoins dead.
