Just got back into coin last couple of week. Made the mistake of using Coinbase. Never again. They've had my funds on hold for nearly 2 weeks despite clearing the bank on the 7th. Customer service is beyond crap. Still no word on resolution. How is crypto going to move forward without legitimate exchanges? Serious question.

Thanks for the investment advice guys. Now my kid has to eat beef broth cubes for next 3 months.

I was like yeah this bitch is going to soar once it hits 10....Better wait for the 9700 dip before buying though.

As long as it's moving you can make money.

Redditors man. They're the types that dont give the acknowledgment nod or "hi" back when you walk by them. 
Most of these people literally have nothing to do but shit on one another. Funny thing is they never defend their views or discuss why they disagree. They simply neg and run away.

Technically, yeah I guess.

You know what a fugazi is?

Why does it go down right after I buy? Every. Time.

Number one rule of Bitcoin. Nobody... and I don't care if you're Brian Armstrong or if you're John McAfee. Nobody knows if a bitcoin is gonna go up, down, sideways or in fucking circles. Least of all, r/bitcoin, right?
