You should note the bait and switch here. Security is the true reason behind the suggested permanent limit on block size.
The initial problem in the OP is deteriorating blockchain security.
Most responses focus on bandwidth and storage issues. These can issues are obviously solved by falling prices for computing. 
The security issue is not so easy to solve. Falling prices for computing don't help one bit.

You are simply wrong. You speak of "average hashpower to produce a block". This doesn't matter in any direct way. 
Provided we ignore latency issues, all that matters is
a) the share of hashpower controlled by the attacker 
b) the number of confirmations the attacker needs to stay ahead of the main chain for.
(People who spit in the face of mathematics make me grumpy.)

Yes. 
@_date: 2012-11-22 03:25:13
You are setting up a false trade-off. PoW technology requires a choice between crippling fees and frequent double-spends. This is true and that sucks. Why not upgrade the technology to something that doesn't suck?
PoS technology allows minimal fees and extremely secure protection. 
Fees can be lowered by an order of magnitude. Simultaneously, attack costs can be raised by an order of magntitue. 
Inferior PoW technology creates the tradeoff. 
Finally, even if bitcoin sticks with PoW, there are better solutions to the problem. For example, reintroducing block reward is better than permanently crippling the technology by rationing use.
@_date: 2012-11-23 07:13:12
Great that you will check out PoS.
As far as b(t) is concerned. Your argument suggests that the current 1 MB limit is too high. Perhaps b(0) should be set to 0.5 MB instead. Then with B(t) = 0.5 * exp(0.2t), we would reach 1 MB in about 3.5 years, 2 MB in 7 about years, 4 MB in about 10.5. This path seems quite sustainable. My point is we should look for a sustainable growth path, not place a permanent cap. The 'permanent cap' will almost certainly get changed later. In the future, this change will become more and more contentious. Any change that affects fees will have big time winners and losers. Big disruptive arguments can be avoided by planning ahead. 
As far as f(t), I understand there is a (rather poorly thought out) commitment to reduce block reward to 0. However, I think a low mandatory fee on coin-age, say 1% per year could be levied without causing an uproar. This would be equivalent to 1% money supply growth in practice, but would not violate the letter of the money supply rules.
Think of the blockchain as a safe that needs to be secure. You can charge for security in at least two ways:
1) Transaction tax levied whenever money is moved in and out of the safe, irrespective of how long the money is stored.
2) Demurrage or inflation tax levied based on how long the money is stored. Demurrage is just taxing each send x% per accumulated year of coin-age. It operates just like inflation, but does not increase money supply or affect the price level. It is a form of mandatory fee equivalent to inflation.
Exclusively relying on (1) encourages people to never move their money, except in huge cash outs. In this case, bitcoin acts only like an investment vehicle rather than a currency.
Exclusively relying on (2) encourages people to only store as much as they need to buy things. This makes bitcoin act like a payments system. 
To be sustainable, bitcoin needs to be both a payments system and a store of value. This is best achieved through a balanced mixture of taxes. 
If you exclusively rely on txn taxes, you will find that tax evasion becomes a big problem. People can evade txn taxes by using a centralized service like Mt.Gox or blockchain.info to transfer funds. Decreasing block size to increase the average fee paid will encounter serious diminishing returns because it will drive users into tax evasion strategies. The txn tax needs to be kept light or it will be unenforceable.
By contrast, the demurrage tax is evaded by storing money in USD and only using bitcoin for payments. Since the US money supply grows predictably at say 5-7%/year, there is a lot of room to increase demurrage taxes without inducing any flight of funds to USD. I think 1% a year would work quite well. Again, the demurrage tax needs to be kept light or it will be unenforcable.

I describe such a system here: 
Tell me why it won't work in the talk page. 
If not then come up with a new slogan for your precious bitcoin.
Bitcoin: High fees and limited uses [that's the best I can do for now, perhaps you can put a better spin on it?]
Anyways, just because bitcoin can't incorporate the whole world doesn't mean it has to stay at 1 MB per block maximum forever. It is a matter of degree and quantity not a black and white issue. Properly done, even PoW should be able to grow in scale over time. Inability to manage fees is the bottleneck here, not storage space and bandwidth.
@_date: 2012-12-11 16:43:02
Yes, it is an even larger advantage for early adopers (though maybe not as you might think because the fees associated with PoS are extremely tiny [e.g. 1% interest per year in PPCoin). You could also offset any undesirable advantage through wealth taxes (inflation or demurrage). I'm not sure big advantages for early adopters are a bad thing. Finally, you could still distribute new coins via PoW, its just that the PoW would just be there to give handouts.
Yes, if someone has 51% of online wealth than they could do chargebacks. That is an extremely high barrier though. Much more difficult to reach than 51% of hashing power. It is also a more uniform barrier. BFL could get 51% easily, but they are on an even footing with any other wealthy guy when it comes to buying coins.
Would it make sense to pump $70 million into bitcon in order to start doing chargebacks? Could you even earn 1% of that from chargebacks? (i.e. you already have 51% of the coin, do you really think you can acquire that much more by ripping off anonymous strangers. The anonymous market would dry up pretty fucking quickly.)
Also, presumably bitcoin is worth $70 million because you can't do chargebacks with it. If so, then doing these chargebacks will completely destroy your assets.

Proving something wrong in theory is useful as a first step. 
Ultimately, I agree with you completely. For example, Bitcoin progressively alters monetary parameters, experimenting with new and more dangerous conditions. It is not safe to store wealth in a system that has never been shown to work in practice.
@_date: 2012-12-11 04:03:09
Bitcoin could have been cheaper. It is just that Proof-of-Work was thrown in there to ruin it all. If you want something bitcoin without the fees than use PPCoin. PPCoin has some design issues (I'm not sure serious they are). If you want bitcoin without the fees and with a more robust design, then convince developers to build one. I can tell them how.
If you want something cheaper still, then don't just get rid of PoW. Also get rid of permanent storage and spendability of low-value outputs. Eventually accumulation of low-value outputs will be another source of costs that need to be paid for with fees. They also restrict bitcon's potential for decentralization. (e.g. if we divide every satoshi among a different private key, then the block chain could be up to 41 exobytes = 1 million * 43 terabytes in size). Dropping low-value outputs after a time delay would effectively cap this. 
@_date: 2012-12-11 04:19:59
No, fees could not be almost as low as electricity cost. You also have to pay miners for their capital investment (both for depreciation and rental costs). In a competitive market, you have to pay off each factor of production.
output = wages + material costs + capital costs
capital costs = (interest rate + depreciation rate) * capital expenditure
This is an arms race. If you decrease material costs (electricity), wages and capital costs are just going to rise in approximately equal proportion. 
How much you pay is directly proportional to how secure the blockchain is. Yes, you can pay less, but then an attacker will also pay less to rape the blockchain.

Long chains are evaluated as a summation over the difficulty target of all blocks in the chain.
Therefore if you mine a special fork where difficulty is halved, then you will need to make twice as many blocks to overtake the main chain. (i.e. reducing difficulty doesn't help the attacker at all)

This is a constrained optimization problem. You are failing to search for an optimum solution.
Let's say we are trying to maximize V(b,f;t) where 
V is some measure of bitcoin's usefulness (e.g. total txn value in USD per year)
The choice variables are:
f(t) in [0,∞]. f is a block reward or an alternative fee type (e.g. demurrage) at time t  
b(t) in [0,∞]. b a max block size b at time t
Another important functional relationship is:
g(b;t) the equilibrium fees associated with a max block size b at time t. 
This function has an inverse U-shape, and the vertex depends on txn demand characteristics at time t.
The constraints are:
f(t) + g(b;t)-F&gt;=0  [where F is some amount of total fees sufficient to ensure security]
b(t)-B(t)&gt;=0 [where B(t) is determined by time-varying bandwidth and storage constraints] 
You are artificially imposing an additional constraint f(t)=0. This is not how you find an optimum. 
You should search over the full space, not just along the line f(t)=0.
If you relax your constraint, you will likely be able to attain a higher value for the objective function.
Moreover, even along the line f(t)=0, it is obvious that the optimal solution will be time-varying. t should appear on the right hand side of the equation. 
The correct solution is most likely b(t) = B(t) and f(t) = 0 if g(b;t)-F&gt;=0 and f(t) = g(b;t)-F if g(b;t)-F&lt;0. 
As a guess, I would suggest B(t) = 1 MB * exp(0.2t) where t is measured in years and t is normalized to 0 at the current time. That gives us 1 MB blocks now and 3 MB blocks in about 6 years. If 1 MB is too big now, then decrease it. 
Picking one solution and sticking with it is equivalent to sticking your head in your ass and keeping it there. 
Of course, you would be better off with PoS, but if you want to hamstring yourself with PoW you might as well try to make the most out of it.
@_date: 2012-11-23 01:06:25
You want an argument?
"Too low and miners will ignore your transaction."
Explain why this would occur if:
a) mining is decentralized AND
b) a block size limit is not centrally dictated.
Now, that you've done part 1. Explain why users will pay a fee larger than 1 satoshi unless either A AND/OR B are false? 
If you can't, conclude that either mining centralization OR some centrally dictated cap on block size is a necessary condition for a non-negligible block reward. Recall that double-spends occur when the block reward is negligible.
Finally, how can mining be completely free market if it fails to protect the network when both (a) and (b) are true?  
If you get stuck, post your work and I'll give you hints.

BeatySees is right about the problem. Increasing the block size poses severe security risks. 
However, BeatySees is wrong about the solution. 
Ideally, the system should be cheap, flexible, and self-sustaining. BeatySees' system may be self-sustaining, but it certainly fails on the first two counts.
Firstly, it is costly. Who wants to pay large fees? Secondly, it is inflexible. Who wants to place permanent limits on the number of possible txns? 
Here is how to do better:
Firstly, block size can be increased if an alternative security mechanism is introduced (proof-of-stake). Fee volume becomes much less important in this case and fees can be allowed to fall to near zero without risk. 
Secondly, block size should be decoupled from security. Rather than allowing block size to determine the average fee, you can simply impose a minimum average fee. If you do this, then block size can grow arbitrarily without any security risk. Demurrage makes the most sense as a mandatory fee. If coupled with PoS, then something small like 0.1% is adequate. If coupled with PoW, then something much larger like 3%+ becomes necessary.
Thirdly, even ignoring the fundamental security concern, block size remains an issue as jgarzik points out.
However, the storage and bandwidth problem is much less intimidating to deal with after you decouple it from security. Simply allow max block size to have a predictable growth rate. Say 20% a year. Simultaneously impose a fee per kb. We can just use the current fee to start. This fee can fall by 20% a year, so that the fee to occupy 1% of a block remains fixed over time. Growth in computing power solves the rest.

So set the fees to 5-10% via dictatorial decree and convince the users to accept the modified protocol. Alternatively develop a protocol which allows users to vote for higher fees (or smaller block sizes). Convince the users to accept this protocol. If you are right, then users should vote in higher fees.
Don't whine about the failings of the economic mechanism. Fix them. It is only going to get harder to make these changes. There will be many more Satoshi's dice in the future. You are not going to get anywhere by pleading with people to not take advantage of money making opportunities.

This is so idiotic. Sure you can replace wasteful electricity expenditures with wasteful expenditures on capital replacement and maintenance. To a first approximation, users pay the same fees regardless. The fees depend upon the amount of resources wasted and not on what form the resource waste takes.

Why should the transaction fee  be set based on supply and demand of block space? This is a coding choice not a law of nature. It is a foolish coding choice.
The primary purpose of fees is to prevent double-spends, not to ration block space. Right? If you agree, why is the amount of fees required set entirely based on the amount of block space available? 
If block space needs rationing, shouldn't a separate fee be used to take care of that? Why link security to block size?
Think outside the box.

"bitcoin has no value", and "nothing can be used for a currency without prior intrinsic value" 
Could you link to those? As an academic economist, I have never heard anything like this from legitimate academic economists. In fact the idea that items with no intrinsic value or gov't backing can be used as currencies is at the core of modern theories of money.
On this, see Kiyotaki and Wright, 
Another example is 
This paper posits that money is equivalent to public memory. Thus the use of the blockchain record appears to have a sound theoretical basis in economic theory. In fact, as you can see from the above paper, economists predicted the use of public memory as a monetary mechanism. 
Perhaps you are referring to Austrian economists? They have something called the Mises regression theorem which implies your false assertions. No real economists believe that crap.

If difficulty is in a stable equilibrium it should happen once every 190 years or so.
If the hash rate is twice what it should be given difficulty, then it will happen 2 times a year. 
So a seemingly small disequilibrium in difficulty can dramatically increase the frequency of these events.
These are approximate values. I'm too tired for accuracy.

I think that the 4 miners would probably implement a set of incentive compatible bribes to save electricity costs. Something like, if you mine then you must divide your block rewards evenly among the cartel. You must also charge cartel level fees. 
Otherwise, the cartel punishes you by orphaning your blocks. If you do not orphan the blocks of deviators, then your blocks are also orphaned.

These jackasses. They say, if you exclude the pre-1939 period there is no positive relationship between deflation and growth.
But look at their data in Figure 3. There are no data points of deflation post-1939 (well if there is one I can't see it). So the conclusion comes only after throwing out every piece of evidence from actual periods of deflation. 
So they are saying, if we exclude actual episodes of deflation from our analysis than we see no evidence that deflation is associated with low growth. That sounds like nonsense because it is. What they are doing is saying, "Hey when we have 40% inflation, then growth tends to be low." and then inferring "If we extend the linear trendline from low growth associated with hyperinflation into the deflation zone, then the implication is that deflation is good for growth. The first step is just to eliminate these pesky datapoints where we see actual deflation because they screw everything up. With the real data out of the way, we can extrapolate the trend..." 
Also it is kind of funny because the whole thing is a straw man. Textbook Keynesian theory (at least since the 1970s) doesn't even predict a positive relationship between inflation and growth once you get above 0% inflation. It predicts a positive relationship between changes in inflation and changes in growth. They never even examine the actual Keynesian prediction students learn in textbooks.
For regular people, such jackasses are hard to believe. In fact they would be better off not writing anything like this because it is such obvious horseshit that it (unfairly) discredits anyone holding similar views.

The authors' result does imply that terrorist type attacks may be cheaper than previously thought.
If the terrorist has enough control of hashing power / sibyl ability to make selfish mining solo profitable, then he would trigger retaliation.

In this case, there would be no reason to start retaliating.

The interest rates on savings accounts are horrible because the gov't owns all the banks, imposes capital controls, and maintains a high inflation level. The state banks earn a huge monopoly margin on the gap between interest offered to household depositors and interest charged on loans.
The value proposition for Chinese households is getting money into some assets that yield a higher real return, such as US treasuries or a USD bank account (well maybe the real yield is negative, but not as negative as what you get by depositing money in a Chinese bank).
Bitcoin allows Chinese households to do this if they want to.  Usually the option to avoid wealth taxes is only available to Chinese elites.

It's okay about the limit. It actually doesn't impose any constraint for Keynesians.
The blockchain can be used to implement monetary policy. Freicoin has shown that. All the FED needs to do is capture 51% and they can do much stronger inflationary stimulus than was ever possible before. Not only could they simulate money printing. They could also use demurrage fees to take money directly out of your wallet. This would stimulate spending. It is like Keynesianism on steriods.
Basically, if monetary policy could be implemented a la bitcoin, we would have escaped this recession a long time ago.

If subsidy is zero and fees are zero, then there is no reason for miners to care about latency. You can also reduce latency by operating a very large pool. Dropping txns is a less efficient way to do it. If the small pools drop txns, then this will reduce their competitiveness. It is not necessarily a good thing.
Whether fees will be 0% or x% of the block reward depends on developmemt decisions. It is not decided through a market process.

Yes, I agree with you. That suggests that the 'short-run payoffs' from attacking could be negative. In this case, even their analysis of the one-off game is incorrect. I also believe that short-run payoffs are likely negative and have argued this before. However, this point is debatable. I'm not 100% sure.
The case that bitcoin is a dynamic game is extremely strong. In a dynamic setting, their argument is wrong. Everyone who knows game theory will know about this. So the challenge becomes just to convince people that it is a dynamic game rather than make a complex argument about short-run payoffs.
Broader point: they do not use a reasonable game-theoretic model in their analysis. This is a much more serious criticism than miscalculation of short-run payoffs.

No. Delay almost completely solves the theft problem.
 
Ignore the limitations of bitcoin for a moment. 
Suppose that all txns have to be entered into the blockchain twice. First you announce a txn and then **at least 24 hours later**, you reconfirm the txn. Without this reconfirmation, the txn gets stuck in limbo.
Suppose also that their is a linked failsafe address. This address is irrevocably specified when the public key first receives coins. Coins can be sent to this address are sent without any delay or need for reconfirmation.
Due to the delay, attacker has to announce his theft attempt publically in the blockchain. You have 24 hours to say "swiper no swiping" and send the coins to your failsafe address. Provided you check your account every day, theft becomes almost impossible. 
If one is really paranoid then the failsafe addresses could be chained.

Large pools aren't harmful to security. Think of the top 3 pools as three powerful players each pointing a gun to each other's head. 
This doesn't seem like a stable arrangement, but because people like pools and dislike huge pools, the oligopoly structure has a way of persisting.
If you were to get rid of all large pools how would miners' coordinate opposition if a new malicious pool was created? 
There is a lot of misunderstanding going around. 
1) asics are good for security not bad.
2) an oligopoly of large pools is good for security not bad.

I forgot to respond to the first paragraph.
If you are judging things based on up front benefits, this sibyl attack is worse than the loyalty program. Benefits from the sibyl attack come from reduced difficulty in the future. Until difficulty drops there is a negative payoff. You mine fewer blocks now, so that you can mine more later. You are essentially forcing bad luck on all miners. 
Hmmm... actually the sibyl attack is infeasible unless accompanied by a loyalty program.
 Some pools use pay per share arrangements I believe (insuring miners against bad luck). As long as these pools commit to keeping there price fixed than bad luck will cause miners to switch to these pools. This will put an end to the bad luck and stop the attack unless also runs a pay per share pool in this case, the attacker invests bitcoin upfront to compensate miners. The investment would be quite substantial it seems.
The loyalty program does not require the pool owner to make an upfront investment at all and yields the same benefits. Again, this paper is a complete waste. The authors are useless attention whores.

Good comment. Three interepretations:
1) The potential BTC market is tiny. If people pay in BTC for novelty value, btc demand will be small and insensitive to price. Price gouging BTC customers is a good business decision. Entry from other companies is not worthwhile because potential volumes are so small.
2) The potential BTC market is large. In addition to a small demand as a novelty purchase. Large numbers of people will prefer to pay in BTC if offered a small discount. Right now the lack of competition leads to high prices and a focus on the novelty market. Eventually competition will enter and prices will drop slightly below fiat.
3) The price decision is due to incompetentence. You cannot infer anything about the market from a stupid decision.
I lean towards 3.

This isn't a refrigerator. Real demand scales with income. Growth will always be exponential unless the technology gets replaced (as in cassette tapes).
bitcoin money demand as a means of payment =(mean income of bitcoin user / mean world income per capita) × avg. share of a bitcoin users payment txns conducted in bitcoin × share of bitcoin users in the total world population × world volume of txns in terms of real value
Assuming no replacement:
The first item could increase or decline in the near term, but will decline in the long run as bitcoin scales, moving towards 1.
The second item will follow a sigmoidal curve.
The third item will follow a sigmoidal curve.
The fourth item has grown exponentially for the past 2 centuries. This will continue and will be the dominant effect in the long-run.
But there will be replacement:
To paraphrase some random econ phd student in chat forum for econ phd students: "the next iteration will issue stabilized units of value representing major world currencies"
Take note of this: random knows nothing of bitcoin, but already sees it is feasible to issue cryptoUSD, cryptoEURO, cryptoYEN, ..., all backed by underlying bitcoin or altcoin equity.
For now, this idea is being fuddled around with by people who have no idea how to manage it, i.e. they don't know how the algorithm works in the real world and thus can't implement it in code. Eventually, the dorky econ phd students will get together with the dorky cs phd students and make this happen. So far the knowledge of the first set of dorks has not been applied to the problem, but this could happen sooner then you expect.

Wrote a mathematical exposition of this here:
You are confusing a static game with a dynamic game. In a repeated dynamic game it is possible to punish people who behave opportunistically.
The authors make this mistake too. It seems to show up a lot when computer scientists attempt to employ game theory.
Think of it this way. Suppose that each miner  adopts the following "grim hair trigger" strategy:
1) if a miner never joins a selfish pool, then I will only mine at an honest pool.
2) if one miner joins a selfish pool, then I will mine at a selfish pool forever.
Miners have invested in mining hardware. The selfish equilibrium risks turning this hardware into a paper weight. This means that the selfish equilibrium has a lower long term payoff for miners. As long as people care about the future (and they do because they threw down money on an asic), playing honestly forever is a subgame perfect equilibrium even if selfish pools become available.
Yes, this theory implies that a selfish pool will take over the network if people were to join it. However, it is not individually rational to join the selfish pool so this is a moot point. 
Missing the forest for the trees we are.
The real problem is that declining block reward = extremely slow ticking time bomb

Thought I should link this here as well:
To summarize the main points:
1) A one-off subgame of bitcoin mining is not incentive compatible. This is no surprise to anyone. One well-known reason is the 51% attack. There are other known reasons as well. The authors' of this paper point out yet another reason which they call selfish mining. This is not noteworthy.
2) The infinitely repeated game of bitcoin mining is incentive compatible. Bitcoin is a repeated game. The miner who mines today is highly likely to mine tomorrow. It doesn't matter if he is anonymous or not, what matters is that he owns mining equipment. This ownership of illiquid capital assets is what sustains cooperation in bitcoin. 
3) That no one has pointed this out is shocking to me. I guess this is why we have economists who specialize in incentive issues. And computer scientists who analyze algorithms. It's great to do cross disciplinary research, but as a dilettante you must communicate with specialists in the field to make sure you are on the right track. This paper is an extremely embarrassing example of bad research done by disciplinary outsiders who are too arrogant to consult with experts. It looks much like one of those papers on cold fusion written in someone's basement to me.
Note: If it is really necessary I can clean up the pdf so that it doesn't look like a third grader wrote it and deal with some more complex situations (e.g. imperfect information). At this point, I just expect the authors to turn beet red and hide in their house for a couple days.

We need to get btc into china. The larger the spread  gets the more the Chinese are paying to evade capital controls. A small spread indicates that bitcoin is winning. A large spread indicates that capital controls are winning. 
It would help if people opened some mechanism for foreigners to pay for Chinese products in bitcoin. Using taobao outside of China is a bitch.. No one ships outside of China, so you need to use a middleman to receive and forward goods to you. Nominally they accept international credit cards but the last two times I did this my card got suspended for suspicious activity (online purchase in China = probable stolen card). I actually ended up using btcchina to get yuan to pay for stuff on taobao.
Someone in China needs to construct a seamless way to buy goods off taobao using bitcoin and reship them overseas.

There are different ways of modelling this. I think that miners are very free to switch between pools, so we can think of a miner's choice of pool as independent of his choice of pool in the previous period.
We would back the miner's game up to 
a) mine at trusted pool or p2p pool with assumed 0 attack probability [we'll see how this is sustained in a second]  
b) mine at untrusted pool with higher pps rate and an attack probability greater than 0. 
Again, you end up only mining at trusted pools because mining at untrusted pools will eventually trigger a period of collective punishment. In order to have two kinds of pools there needs to be some signal that allows attacks to be eventually traced back to a particular kind of pool.
A trusted pool is then a pool with a long history of good signals, or if there are no signals, then it would have to be something transparent like P2Pool.
An untrusted pool would probably be a new entrant with no history.
The pool's problem is also interesting.
The trusted pool can either
a) Decide to attack in which case it risks becoming untrusted in future periods
b ) Decide not to attack in which case it will accumulate more trust allowing it to increase the future its fees/user base
The established pool's trust status or reputation allows it to charge higher fees than a new pool. Reputation is just like a capital asset. It gives the pool a stake in remaining honest just like ASIC ownership gives miners a stake in remaining honest.
Note: Yes this can be formalized. If you got a PhD in economics at a good university, then you solved problems like this in school. I don't think formalization would help that much. Either you have an audience that can't understand the result or an audience that already knows the result.

Suppose one does not believe in intellectual property rights.
Is there way to undermine IPR using a combination of a fully anonymized bitcoin and an anonymous messaging service?
Many types of IPR are trade/national secrets controlled by multinationals and governments. They are not protected by patents, but are illegal to disclose and use unless independently discovered.
Suppose that Alice anonymously broadcasts an encrypted trade secret, a bitcoin address, and a price per word call it p. There are several sequential layers of encyption, say layer 1 encrypts word 1, layer 2 encrypts word 2, ...
Bobs would like to reveal the trade secret publically. They send bitcoin to Alice's posted address. As Alice's address receives p bitcoins, an encryption key is revealed, progressively publicizing the secret to the public.
Anonymization (e.g. coin mixing) makes it impossible or at least extremely hard to determine the identities of Alice and the Bobs.
The idea is to incentivize the public release of corporate and national secrets. Presumably the the number of self-interested people with access to these secrets greatly exceeds the number of idealistic whistleblowers. 
Note: progressive revelation helps discourage Alice from cheating. If she doesn't deliver goods in the opening words, people will stop paying.

Gold lost 33% of its value in the first 6 months of 2013, doubled in price between 2008 and 2011, fell by 7.4% in a single day.
To solve volatility, we need to back a decentralized USD cryptocurrency with bitcoin or something similar.

Because this makes security convenient and that is a very big deal.
* cold storage = secure and inconvenient
* hot wallets = insecure and convenient. 
* hot wallet linked to cold storage failsafe = secure and convenient
 
The failsafe address is a high security address (kept in a paper wallet in a safe). 
The low-security key is a hot wallet, linked to the failsafe address. 
Suppose you run an online exchange. The low-security key is your hot wallet. You store all your customers' BTC in this hot wallet. This is convenient, but it sounds risky. Is it?
No, you can review txns signed by your low-security key once a day. If you discover suspicious activity, you can issue the failsafe txn, **reversing** all txns conducted over the past 24 hours. All the stolen BTC would be reclaimed.

Let's examine the fees on the middleman who pops as the first search result (presumably they charge more than average, but they are also less likely to cheat you):
You pay in two stages. That is already pretty amazingly complicated for online shopping.
First Stage Payment:
1) actual cost of item
2) domestic shipping cost in China (no doubted marked up)
3) service fee is 1 USD per parcel
Second Stage Payment:
4) 10%*(First Stage Payment - Service Fee) 
5) International Delivery Fee (expect another markup over cost)
6) Storage Costs (if they need to delay shipment; you will see these occur when you try to consolidate several different items, somehow one of the items will take a month to arrive. They will suggest shipping them separately to add to their fees)
 
Optional Insurance:
7) 3% * (The total first and second stage payments)  
Passing on credit card fees:
8) Add 3.5% for paying by credit card.  
9) No guarantee that you will receive the actual item advertised on Taobao. Buyer Beware:
 
I'd estimate that (w/insurance) the average markup is 25% over the price of the item on taobao. If you want to purchase from some small online seller rather than the Chinese version of ebay, well, good luck finding someone to do this for you.

There is no upfront loss of money on either side.
The loyalty program only kicks in if the 51% attack succeeds.
As long as the attack starts with a non-zero chance of succeeding, then the dominant strategy is to join the attack until the chance snowballs to 100%. 
This sibyl attack really works in the exact same way.
I would recommend dropping a couple of coin on PPCoin, but saving your horde until something better designed comes along. Possibilities right now are Nxt and Netcoin. 
Netcoin looks secure/robust as far as I can tell, but is progressing either very slowly or perhaps not at all. 
Nxt has some intrinsic flaws like bitcoin, but I expect it to work in practice anyways. It seems to be progressing much faster.
Ultimately, someone is going to throw together a secure PoS coupled with sustainable, decentralized units of cryptoUSD, EUR, CNY, etc. and crush bitcoin. This is still not on the horizon. Mastercoin and bitshares are not designed well (you need to know something about international finance to design a long-run sustainable peg). 
I think I know how to do this and expect that eventually my ideas will trickle down into the heads of computer programmers. Problem is that they need to know international finance to understand why mastercoin and bitshares are broken and how they could be fixed. That's a bit of an obstacle.

Paper is about pool using strategy to earn more than its 'fair' share of rewards. Their are so many ways for pools to do this already that it is pointless to delve into yet another mechanism. 
In general, a pool with 51% of hashing power can capture 100% of rewards.
A simple miner loyalty program is enough to incentive membership in a monopoly pool and break bitcoin's PoW security model. Consider this as one (of many) examples:
1) Pool distributes standard mining reward as long as it has less than 51%
2) Pool offers loyalty program to reward contributors to 51% monopoly. If the pool gains 51%, then the extra returns are divided in proportion to each miner's cumulative contribution to pool hashing.
Result: 
If pool never achieves 51%, then miners do not lose or gain from joining the pool. If pool achieves 51%, then miners gain from joining the pool as early as possible. 
As long as there is a non-zero probability that the pool achieves 51% in the future, miner's dominant strategy is to join the pool now. i.e. competitive mining is not incentive compatible. I don't think anyone reasonably well-informed and intelligent ever thought it was.
Altruism: Bitcoin's security model relies heavily on altruism. This is the sad truth of the matter. The reason pools don't do this is because people would protest (at least for now). This attack strategy would fail for the same reason (and if it becomes successful in the future, then so would a simple consumer loyalty program).
Commentary: If you wrote that a simple consumer loyalty program achieves the same end, would anyone care? No. Consumer loyalty program does not sound as computer-sciencey as Sibyl attack and thus cannot be used for circle jerk purposes.
tl;dr paper is a pointless, masturbatory exercise telling us what we should already know and recommending whack-a-mole changes to the intrinsically flawed PoW security model.

In other words, each time a bubble occurs the long-term fundamentals improve as a consequence of the bubble. There is a circular relationship between the two.

The misguided part is thinking that this matters in any way. We should only care about behavior not algorithms. This does not have any implications for behavior.
This is why the selfish miner paper is completely wrong. Selfish miner gets more blocks sure, but this is completely irrelevant to understanding miner behavior.

Can we get a video of the following?
1) Someone buying bitcoins in Melbourne from the ATM.
2) Having them sent directly to a sale address for the ATM in Vancouver.
3) The person in Vancouver taking the receipt and returning later to get their CAD.
Seems like the video could make bitcoin real for average people without using any words at all.

The issues that killerstorm points out are the big ones in my opinion:
(i) declining block reward 
(ii) case where mining expenses are dominated by electricity 
I agree that the current rules are not sustainable in the long-run. The reason I'm pestering these guys is because they are investigating all the wrong things. Rather than looking at killerstorm's killer issues, they are looking at a bunch of irrelevant stuff. Sort of like playing selfish miner Sudoku instead of manning the blockchain's defenses.
The good news is that bitcoin is in unusually good shape security-wise at the current moment. It doesn't need to depend on altruism to operate for the following reasons:
a) Since block reward is still quite high the extra amount you could gain by imposing monopoly fees would be small as a percentage of total earnings.
As we move forward to block halvings, monopoly will multiply miner earnings by a larger and larger factor. Not good.
 
b) Mining costs are primarily depreciation of bitcoin-specific capital equipment rather than electricity. This is a huge improvement from the GPU days.
To see why high electricity costs get us into trouble, consider the following:
- Suppose for every 1 BTC mined that miners pay 0.9 BTC in electricity. A 51 % attack could cause revenue to go to revenue of 2 BTC and electricity cost to decrease to 0 (b/c you can simply threaten to mine rather than mine). This is a 20-fold increase in BTC-denominated earnings. If electricity costs are negligible, then attack only offers a 2-fold increase in earnings. 
As you can see, high electricity costs can cause a massive increase in attack incentives.

Follow on comment.
Economists are highly conformist on average. Regardless of what they think privately, they will not say anything positive about bitcoin in public.
Simon Johnson is a well-known maverick and opinion leader. He doesn't care so much about conforming. It is important to promulgate this. Once an opinion leader says something positive, it becomes more socially acceptable for other more conformist economists to say positive things about bitcoin.

For the record, mastercoin has design flaws and may be a bad investment, but it is NOT a ponzi.
 Appropriately timed, bitshares could be a good investment, but it IS a ponzi. Ponzis are zero sum games. If you play it like the bitshares developers plan to, you could come out way ahead. (Make sure to invest anonymously however because the FEDS will try to seize your winnigs to compensate the fraud victims.)
Tell Tale Criterion: No mention of interest bearing BTC deposits for savers in Mastercoin whitepaper or press releases.

This is one of the ironies of relying purely on math to derive conclusions. If you throw in one implausible assumption or modelling choice in the beginning, the math can check out even though the conclusion is dead wrong.
If you combine good intuition (basic economic reasoning) and math, then the results are much better than if you rely only on one or the other.

Yes. The above topic is relevant to this. Proof of stake is far more robust to gov't interference. 
Seeing ASICs as vulnerable to gov't control is just silly. All proof of work is equally vulnerable to gov't interference. ASICs offer better security against profit motivated attacks than GPUs or CPUs. Moving technology backwards won't protect anyone from the government and simultaneously will leave bitcoin users more exposed to 51% attacks from privateers.
The core development community dislikes proof of stake though, so don't expect this to influence development of the bitcoin protocol.
Aside: these guys seem a little unhinged to me.

tl;dr authors of "Majority is not enough...","Bitcoin is broken", etc. made very basic game theory errors leading to an erroneous conclusion; bitcoin only has to worry about terrorists; rational miners will never attack, ever.*

no. The point is you have to adjust interest in bitBTC to match whatever is offered in BTC. 
(i.e. The interest rate of bitcoin could be 7% 1% 3% it could vary among these variables)
It doesn't matter. The important part is that it is outside of your control (i.e. you are not the bitcoin devs)

Excluding question 4, these questions are specific to the PoS system I described in the [proof of stake wiki] ( Here are some answers:
1) Yes, you pay demurrage of 5% per year by default. This is equivalent to 5% inflation per year, about 1/4 of what btc users currently pay to PoW miners. Participating in PoS mining allows you to avoid demurrage fees. If your node is down when you are randomly selected to participate, then you lose your opportunity to avoid fees. 
Notes: For small holders, opportunities to participate and avoid fees are extremely rare (say once per year if you hold 0.0001% of the money supply). For these individuals, participation is only practical via a banking intermediary. Banks would maintain nodes and use PoS mining revenue to pay interest on deposits. Users with privacy concerns can opt to forgo interest and pay 5%/ year demurrage. PoW system would eventually need to offload smallhoder accounts on banks anyway or blockchain storage and bandwidth requirements will explode. 
2) Yes, payment happens at your next txn. Txns need to include demurrage fees in order to be included in blocks. 
 
3) PoW operates independently of PoS. PoW difficulty is uniform for all PoW miners. PoW submissions are validated by randomly draw PoS miners. This requirement ensures that all PoW mining activity occurs in the public eye, making double spends almost impossible.
4) Cementing is not a feature of any of my PoS systems. I think you are referring to Meni's proposal. Personally, I do not think that cementing is a good idea.
Finally, this PoS system is just a theory and has never been implemented. Tacotime is working on a project employing a closely related PoS system.  See:

Remittances would also be nice. Huge migrant remittance inflows ihto china.
I have an idea about this.
The remittance business has major scale economies. Western Union rapes you, but they offer the service workdwide so people submit to it. (E.g. another time the bank shutdown my cc when I was actually in China, I turned to WU to make rent.)
To be competitive BTC remittances should focus on city pairs with intense bilateral migration flows. For China-US, the most obvious choice is Fuzhou/New York City.
It is feasible to establish meatspace remittance offices in these two cities and advertise heavily within the target communities. It is infeasible to build a global network.

Don't agree. To function well, the currency needs at an extreme minimum 100-fold more users than it currently has. We are either:
a) using a doomed technology, or
b) still in the very early stages of innovation
Increases in the market price reflect an increased perceived probability of (b). But ask a random sample of 100 us citizens the following question: Do you think you'll using bitcoin to buy stuff online in 10 years? I'll be damned if you can find 1% of the popupation that says yes. 
This tells you that the market's probability weight on (a) is 99% or more. Sure, the people actively invested don't think so, but that is why they have exhibited different investment behavior from the other 99.9%.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:03:06
Here are the plus sides.
1) If you use cpu mining or gpu mining and bitcoin gets hit with a 51%  attack and the price collapses. In this case, miners aren't really screwed. They can sell their cpus and gpus to regular joe's for about the same price as before the attack. 
If miners use ASICs on the other hand, a 51% attack will impose major losses on them. That's a good thing.
2) Suppose litcoin prices tank. There will soon be too many gpus chasing too few litecoin. Some miners will just break even and others will shutdown. That's bad. Essentially the miners will have hardware that earns very little via honest mining, but could earn 20 times as much profit through an attack. That's temptation. ASICs are much more expensive than GPUs and more energy efficient as well. There is a larger safety buffer ensuring that honest ASIC mining remains profitable. I expect this to persist as long as ASIC energy efficiency keeps improving at a rapid rate.

Fair enough, but quoting a useful post on bitcoin talk:


The point is that whether the result is correct or not is inconsequential.
There are plenty of existing methods of incentivizing a short-sighted 51% attack. The important question is: Would miners join such an attack if it increased their immediate income?
