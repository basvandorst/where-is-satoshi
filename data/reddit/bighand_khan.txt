@_date: 2019-07-02 19:19:51
as more ppl get to know crypto and the control it gives them over their wealth, money and ppl flow into bitcoin market,but there is less than 21mil btc available, then we see the true value of bitcoi, then at that time one btc is too much and ppl living on satoshis.
right know there are still very few ppl owning bitcoin and its 10k imagine if just 20 percent of the population start tp invest in bitcoin,
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:51:52
what if in five years u look back and see the same thing ?

i do it sometimes, but just a small portion of my holding, and when i see the high probability, coz how do i know it does go up or down :D
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:48:35
its good f0r the price to go up, even less coins, scarce asset. and then in the future we live on satoshis, 0.0001 for the bills and rent
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:44:40

@_date: 2019-06-04 16:02:58
get trezor or ledger nano, but if u dont wanna buy physical for any reason get a wallet like coinomi, exodus, jaxx and many more, or use paper wallet
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:19:01
sell now and cry in 20 days
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:08:56
Lets hodl and see ,maybe it happens :D
@_date: 2019-06-18 02:51:18
i dont think so but if it goes to 5k, it be the same as the last drop from 20 k to 3k ,then we WILL have more parabolic move to top, but it aint happen before it hits 10-12k or more
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:23:45
almost had heart stop when i saw video thumbnail which was written 6k

im looking for tourist space x flight thing
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:03:13
well, if it drops i buy more....
if it pumps up,i just hodle 
sell off is not an option, never
just selling tiny amount whenever i need those filthy cash for living
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:55:57
asic machines, and powerfull ones since the  block difficulty is very high right now,mining is not a cheap option,also takes lotsa electricity, for start i suggest just dca and accumulate bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-04 02:50:56
in  4-5 years from now,no one gonna believe the bitcoin price
everyone gonna wish that they've bought bitcoin, at 10k$, its even more huge than 2017 move, ppl gonna live on satoshis, and bitcoin will be currency of the world.
its easy to see the future, if u just see how many nodes and hashrate is backing bitcoin,because in the future no currency is more trusted and established than bitcoin, this is something im very sure about it....
20k,50k or 100k is nothing,most ppl gonna sell at those prices and they Will regret it
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:17:07
agree leveraging rekt people and enrich exchanges
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:01:02
its just his opinion, although 1k is almost impossible, even if charts shows that, it is fundamentally impossible, unless some catasteophic chain of events, then everything else is broken, but anyone is free to say anything, in my opinion it dosent go down anymore and im long, but even if it does, thats not the end, btc is still bitcoin with all its quallities, do u think mining companies with such a huge riches ever let it go that low? i dont think so... even peter schiff didnt say 1k,he said 4k...ans im sure he holds btc himself secretly, most of the loud bears make those noises to drop the price so they can buy more... one must be blind not to see the qualities of this unique currency, it has every properties that previous currencies lacking. also TA, is not only ema, check rsi, macd and stochastic... all show bottomed
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:03:12
recover from what
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:39:58
lets see how this week closes ,it might just recover ,weve seen this situations before many times recovered ,lets hope this is one of those.
this is our saving money,not to be touched for long time,in few years this prices are joke ,even if i trade its for more bitcoin not more fiat ,so comparing the price to dollar is just one dimension in my opinion,also keep in mind that dollar is also a currency .... bitcoin is just 10 years old,very young yet made history
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:16:24
Dca helps u recover ur losses
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:24:38
buy at any price
and dont sell for fiat
keep it and later on buy what u need with btc
there are vendors who accept btc, i buy my vaping stuff and drone stuff and also clothing with btc i earn from mining and small time trading (dont trade on exchanges who ask for kyc) , from many websites
if one day bitcoin be accepted by all vendors and u buy all ur stuff with btc, then u control goverment not them control u,and the world will be a better place.
cryptocurrency wants to change the world, if we want to, if we force vendors to adopt it.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:45:09
Well,of course i sold !!!!
But bought more again , this situations always helps to hoard more BTC, using those filthy dollars,FOR holy BTC
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:25:32
