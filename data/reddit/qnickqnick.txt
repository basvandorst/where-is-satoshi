It doesn't matter what price they list if they can't fulfill their orders

And shopping at a co-op!  Best of both worlds being able to support locals using crypto.

As another guy said, value change is not the same as gaining interest

Its about knowingly accepting money from someone directly speaking about crimes.  There's an argument to be made legally for conspiracy at that point.  If someone is buying bitcoins from you and is talking about how they can't wait to get some blow from a tor market with said bitcoins, you may be breaking laws.

"Factory clean" you mean...

It wont grow, it will have the same amount of bitcoins as it did at the start unless btc is added or withdrawn.  If the usd/btc exchange rate goes up your bitcoin can increase in value... But you will not collect interest for a wallet

That speaks to the intelligence of the scanner though...

There have been serious concerns about electronics being rerouted to gov't sites to be modified.Perhaps there isn't an incident exactly like you mentioned, but if someone is concerned about security its something to keep in mind.  Maybe my tinfoil hats just on too tight...

Just don't lie and fraudulently accept money while fucking up and you're good.Its not them failing that is the issue, its that they tried to squeeze every penny out of their customers with bullshit delays

Switch to a credit union.  Why would you want to be an accountholder at a bank like Chase which looks down on your use of your own money?

I'm pretty sure you can get your account banned for calling for vote manipulation like that...Just fyi

Its easier to just use a UV light to simulate the proper triggers needed to fruit mushrooms.

It's not a BTC thing, it's an AML thing.  Large chunks of cash entering and exiting your account is the issue, not that its coming from BTC trading sites.  Any bank in the US will have to be compliant with AML and KYC regulations, and would flag your account for such transfers.

Not the point I was making but fair enough, can't argue with your conclusion.

So if I claim there are magic magma worms deep in the earth should that be accepted as true until someone definitively proves it wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:58:29
I'm kind of surprised at the amount of hostility you're getting.  Is it a sort of investor-snob thing where they're claiming your experience isn't valid since you're not speculating?  Do they not realize that the more people get on board the stronger bitcoin becomes? Do they think you're claiming you 'saw it coming' because you've been watching bitcoin?I'm not sure, but I'm sorry the internet is full of asshats.  I'll make sure not to say too much more on this subreddit

You're paying for power to run them as well (or so I assume, maybe you don't) as well as generating heat.  Not trying to tell you what to do, but if you scale up on USB mining your currently small loss will get scaled up as well.Edit: well I'm getting down voted for trying to let someone know bitmining isn't free.  I'm not wrong though. And USB miners are pretty inefficient.  I give up on this subreddit.  Bitcoin isn't a ponzi scheme but you folks sure make it seem like one

Bitcoin is complicated.  If people can't get their head around it at this point perhaps they should wait until a company like coinkite makes it accessible for people who know nothing about the function.
Maybe someone has to work a bit to understand it, but this infographic has most everything.  Add in some info on good privacy and security practices and it would be golden.

It seems you totally misread his post and put words in 's mouth.
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:41:35
It seems like it was just one guy tweaking hard hoping to bluff his way to a trillion dollar payout.The dude claims he's Satoshi, Nate Silver (but then he backtracks), a bitcoin developer Gavin, Fontas... The list goes on.The dude was (is?) thinking Gwern was singlehandedly manipulating just about every aspect of bitcoin.  That goes beyond conspiracy and into paranoia.Long read but worth it if you want to read about a blogger trying to unravel a madman's 'theory'

You can, but your wallet's address is not secure once you've sent bitcoins to someone else.So its safer to make sure to zero out any wallet addresses once you've used it once.A good password and better built in security like this BIP0038 thing ( I haven't read up on it yet) can help prevent people from brute force hacking your wallet, but if you have your coins in a wallet that only you have the address for you've got another type of security.

This isn't even news, its them stating bitcoin's price at three different times.  What's the merit of this article?
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:54:18
Fair enough. Ive seen a couple USB-only bitmining operations (40+) that had to have fans running to prevent overheating and just wanted to share.Wasn't trying to be a buzz kill, but can see how I was one.
