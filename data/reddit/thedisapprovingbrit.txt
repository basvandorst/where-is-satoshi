I only got in 3 months ago. The last month has wiped out most of my profits so far - if I cashed out now I'd only get a 30% return. 
That's a 30% return on 3 months, and a third of that investment was a month ago at it's peak. No panic here yet. It's just a shame that if I want to buy a marijuana, it's gonna cost me big right now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:23:50
In hindsight, sure. But with my luck I would have bought loads yesterday and found myself with a massive loss today.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:09:53
I tried trading before. Too much stress for too little return. Now I buy a little each payday and forget about it.

So where do you put the seed to keep it safe? And if you have to keep a seed safe, why can't you just keep the private key safe in the same place?

I keep my funds on a paper wallet, but I watch it on BC because opening the app at work and seeing my net worth go up faster than I'm actually earning it pleases me in a perverse way.

That bubble coincided perfectly with my last venture into Bitcoin. In the space of a month, I bought at £220, traded 10-20 coins worth, then sold at £800. It crashed about a week after I sold up. 
Just bought in again a month ago. This time I'm holding.

0.01btc is still $170. I'd go 0.001 if you're just "getting comfortable"

Sorry for your loss. I bought in 2013, watched the price jump from £200 to £800 in the space of a couple of weeks, then bailed and sold it all right before it crashed. The value got high enough that the thought of losing it all started to scare me. The fact that it crashed so soon after validated my decision, and I never thought about it again until a month ago, when I bought back in.
I've made 50% profit in the last 4 weeks, so I bought more this week. This time, I'm buying amounts I can afford to lose and plan to hold it a lot longer. If/when it gets enough that I can buy a house, I'll cash out again. If the market starts to stagnate for a significant period, maybe I'll cash out early.
I'd be a millionaire if I'd held back then, but I got scared and sold. That was the right thing to do, because you shouldn't be scared of how much money you have. Now I'm in a better position to reinvest. Looking back on the lost opportunity is just a waste of time.

I only bought back in a month ago, but I'm keeping track of the average fiat cost of all my bitcoin (i.e. how much I spent divided by how much I own).
My first purchase was at £5623 4 weeks ago. My second was at £9365 this morning. Right now I can afford for the price to drop to £6925 before I actually start making a loss.

I mean I can understand it'd be a surprise, but by that point you've already paid, so what can you do?
@_date: 2016-12-09 23:55:02
Not really. Its proof that people have bitcoin, and this is what it costs to spend/sell them. Its not like you really have a choice if you want the transaction to be processed. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:58:10
I consider the cheaper alts to be a lottery. For $10-20 you can get a respectable number of coins and be in early. If it grows, you're looking at serious profit. If not, you're only out the price of a pizza.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:53:11
Currency/commodity, the point stands. Unless some vulnerability is found or exploited, it's unlikely that the value will drop to zero overnight. 
Obviously there's a possibility, and in that case everyone will lose everything. But it's far more likely that it will crash slowly enough for most people to be able to be able to sell for *something*, and the longer you've been holding, the more likely it becomes that *something* is still a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:40:34
I'm confused. From your FAQ, you use your own internal coins to provide liquidity. Nothing on your website indicates that your customers should have to wait beyond the "10-60 minutes" to confirm the transaction. 
Your role here isn't to protect your customers against market volatility, its to pay out your customers in their desired currency in the timescales shown on your site. Your decision to send 165BTC to Uphold is a completely separate situation that has nothing to do with your customer. Why is that transaction not showing as "All done" yet?
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:56:38
Sure you can. I just bought back in for £120 three weeks ago - it's worth £150 now. I'll buy another £100 or so next month regardless of price. 
£100 a month is an amount I can afford to lose, but buying a little at a time also helps protect me, by building up a buffer of profit as long as the price keeps rising. Right now, I can watch the price drop back to £5600 before I start to lose money. 
Of course, if the market completely collapses I still lose the lot, but that's only going to happen if something seriously undermines it as a currency - for example if somebody figures out a way to reverse engineer a private key, or we find out a state level actor has spent the last few years brute forcing keys with millions of dollars worth of kit, and now possesses a significant number of the keys.

Or just forgot all about it. There's a lot of abandoned wallets from around that time. 
At some point, at least a few of those people will stumble across their old gaming PC and fire it up out of nostalgia. They'll see their bitcoin wallet on their desktop, open it, and see the 25 coins they were awarded from that time they successfully mined a block. They'll chuckle to themselves at the crazy shit they used to waste their time on back in the day. Something in the back of their mind will remember seeing something about bitcoin in the news a while back. They'll google the price just to see if anything ever came of it. 
Then they'll sell.

I'm not convinced that it's any worse than Nexchange, who claim to only use internal coin reserves for liquidity, and yet have apparently accepted an order which they can't meet without putting their clients funds at risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:26:59
So your next step is to use whatever liquidity you have in other currencies to fill this order while you're working to resolve this issue. It's not your clients fault, they shouldn't be kept waiting for their transaction to complete.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:56:00
In at $7500 here. Only for about $150 worth but 30% is 30%.

If something happens to disrupt computers on a large enough scale to bring down bitcoin, we're all going to have way bigger problems to worry about.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:53:41
I think Nexchange need to stop talking about this as their clients money. It isn't - the transaction between Nexchange and Uphold has nothing to do with the guy who wanted to change his currency. Nexchange are very clear in their FAQ that they don't use third party exchanges for liquidity, so as it stands right now, they are holding 3179 ETH of their client's money. 
What they need to do is pay their customer using their internal coin reserves as per their FAQ, and then deal with Uphold as a separate issue. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:25:51
Same. I've been watching for weeks on the run up to payday, saying to myself "Its fine - the actual amount of bitcoin I get isn't really relevant, the important thing is that its going up." 
Literally as soon as I bought it seemed to go into freefall.

I'm so happy right now. I got a new phone this week and because of work, I haven't been able to call the bank to set up 2FA on it. I've been watching the price go higher and higher, every day planning to set up 2FA so I can buy. Then when I finally have cash on hand I check the price and it's lower than it was when I first looked. Result!
