But the life span of FIAT that exists in shitty ass countries that are failing as a whole and even god himself could not save them counts?
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:01:07
Reading all these comments makes me think 99% of people here have never learned even BASIC economics in school. Do they not teach you or were you sleeping in class? I have lived trough 3000% inflation and every time i start talking about it here some one gives me the most retarded points on how basically my life is a lie.
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:40:35
I remember few people on CryptoCurrency telling me that using LocalBitcoin is legit. No middle man here LMAO.
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:14:07


Yeah and we have 99.9% of shops not accepting it. If i can't live on Bitcoin by buying food gas and paying my bills its not really relevant.
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:17:23
No one. In my country we had inflation up the ass (because we dropped communism) and got paid weekly and at times daily and spent the money ASAP since you could wake up and your money being worth shit. Currently Bitcoin as a currency is exactly that. Your boss can pay you 1000$ and you can go to sleep and awake up with 400...
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:19:32


What makes a cryptocurency a counterfeit? You not liking it? If so even if you remove the "counterfeit" coins you are left with way more failing curencies than FIAT...
@_date: 2018-05-06 22:29:50


Yeah because places that accept Bitcoin don't list dollars but list like 0.00024 Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:32:18


And then the meth wears off? 
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:35:05
I have a theory that the main reason people on here hate banks is because most of you are from the US and are terrible with money. That or your banks are complete shit. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 13:31:19
 That's implying anyone used it. Most was just people on reddit pumping up the price. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:17:40
Citation needed. Also comparing your coin to a failing country is not a smart thing imo.
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:46:15


Well if i say "Well X country is good because its better than North Korea" it doesn't sound good imo.
@_date: 2019-08-04 12:20:23
Posts like these really make me love my bank.
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:38:24


Yeah he never said that in his comment WTF?
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:11:24


At this point I can assume anyone trusting this sub is a complete moron who was dropped as a child.
Every time you fuckers hold you get shafted. I didn't sell at the ATH but do you know what I got? Fucking profit. The same profit I used to buy all my shit back from you suckers after the price dropped. So now I got coins in my wallet and money in my pocket. Please don't sell so I can do more easily...
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:59:44
Most of you people will never sell so how will you buy a lambo?
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:04:45
Do you get something for running a node? 
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:56:07


What about the reason its NOT accepted anywhere? Can't pay my bills, cant pay rent, cant buy food and clothes.
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:47:20
Hey im not the one who replied 30 times dodging the question. So i have that going for me.
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:31:08


While you argue Cash vs Bitcoin. Unless we can agree than the argument of some one mugging me and stealing my cash was retarded?
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:21:50


Banks vs Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:58:41
Took you long enough to admit you don't know the answer. We are done here. You lost wife beater.
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:26:06
You spend so much time telling me Bitcoin is Cash and Cash is differnt that money in a bank yet not you go back to Bitcoin vs Banks. Its like you are going in circles.


Unless its like... Coinbase right?


Sorry im not American so i dont follow these traditions.
@_date: 2018-07-29 05:02:43


@_date: 2018-07-29 15:10:33
Its pretty simple. Yet no one answered it. Strange.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:40:04


You have replied to me like 10 times today. Please stop. You are making a fool of yourself. I hope my ELI5 comment helped you understand how banks work since you have clearly never seen or used one in your life. I have 0 fucking idea why you think that im talking about CASH when im talking about money IN THE BANK. Did a bank fuck your wife or something?
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:31:29
So yes a bank seo did fuck your wife. I can't say i blame her if she had to put up with you LMAO.
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:53:35
Nah i understand that you are the only one dumb enough not being able to answer it. Other people had 0 problems. Seems like the problem is not the question.
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:59:37
1. So its in no way comparable to banks as the title states.
2. So banks still are better since they protect you even if you are incompetent.
3. 0 Idea what that has to do with anything but im ok to pay for protection of my funds.
4. Why i like the idea i don't know what will happen if any of the Bitcoin banks and so on get "Hacked" and you get a middle finger in the end.
5. So stay away from bitcoin and use banks? Gotcha.
So why are you all hating on banks again?
@_date: 2018-07-29 03:15:21


The cash in my wallet has nothing to with the bank you fucking moron thats why your argument is shit. The cash in my cards is in my bank i would love to see some one mug me and get it.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:32:51
Ok ill just try to explain like i would to a toddler so please read this slowly.
I have my MONEY in my BANK, and if something happens to them MY BANK can get MY MONEY back to me. Ok? Good.
If i send MY MONEY trough MY BANK to someone BY MISTAKE i can still get them back. Are you following me Timmy?
If some one stole MY PRIVATE KEYS (card details) and gets some of MY MONEY out of MY BANK i can get it back. Get it? I hope so.
If i have CASH outside MY BANK, MY BANK has no obligation to get them back to me. (I have no idea why you think that they should)
I hope you have learned something about banks today.
Now lets try the Bitcoin shit.
If i send some Bitcoin to the wrong adress? Fucked.
If i get hacked and some one gets my Bitcoins? Fucked.
If something else happens and i lose my private keys. Fucked.
Can there be any case where im not Fucked? Nope.
I honestly can't think of a more simple way to explain this to some one with mental retardation but i can try to draw you some pictures on paint if that would help.
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:08:11
You can't answer my question with a question bud. I got a few replies to my comment and not a single one answered my question.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:47:24


Yep you are correct. If some one steals my gold bars there is absolutely no way for me to get them back. Nope. None. LMAO
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:45:07


And yet from 30 retarded replies i still understand that BANKS have insurance and Bitcoin doesnt so it still safer and better to use BANKS. So in short the context of the comic is dumb because BANKS&gt;BITCOIN. Bitcoin sounds real good when no one could answer a simple question about it.
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:16:04
Whats the answer to my question and why do you have such a hard time with it? I got 1 normal reply that made a pretty solid point while you are still shaking in front of your keyboard writing dumb comments.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:26:47


You honestly think that the bank has anything to do with the cash outside my accounts/cards? I don't think you have the right to use the word moron.
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:35:49
BAN ALL CARS BECAUSE SOME ONE MIGHT DRINK AND DRIVE AND KILL SOME ONE.
I used guns as an example because reddit goes buttmad when you talk about banning guns.
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:35:13
You think i need a bank to use my money? Why? I can get paid in cash, spend cash and store cash in a safe. No idea in what shitty country you live that you NEED to use a bank all the time. Must be that family mixing thats finally gotten to you.
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:48:22


You are explaining that to some one who lives in an ex soviet country that had hyper inflation and had pretty much nothing to eat (even if people on reddit telling me that communism is amazing). Also so far we are keeping shit [pretty smooth]


Maybe in the US yes but where i come from that was never the case. Both my parents worked, they got extra work to do at home after work, my grandparents also worked and the took care of the children when they could. I started working shitty jobs at about 15-16 (in b4 BUT ITS ILLEGAL) so i have never even been close to the American dream and yet we have a 87% of home-ownership.
In short i know there are reasons to hate banks but CURRENTLY i can't see using bitcoin for anything thats talked about in this sub. Also thank you for your normal comment since pretty much every one else replied like i insulted their wife with my comment.
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:05:58
So your way of winning arguments is acting retarded until people give up on replying so you can go "Ah yes run away".
Most people dont reply to morons who see no difference between cash and money inside a bank and think that if some one steals something from you there is nothing you can do to get it back?
Do you live in some country like the UK where the police are worthless or something?
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:54:00
Just ask yourself. If an outsider comes here sees me asking a simple question and then reads all the shit you wrote what will he think about Bitcoin and its users? Probably not highly. Good job being an anti-ad for the thing you fap to so much.
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:25:30
I seem to have finally broken you old man. LoL.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:38:09


So if I have money in the Federal Reserve and some one steals them from there they would do absolutely nothing to get them back to me? Sorry i had no idea that Banks in the US have 0 protection on their customers. That explains all the hate then. My bad i was wrong. ^^^^/s
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:37:19
I would love to know how Bitcoin protects me if some one steals some of my bitcoin/money like my bank does.
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:07:05


Um... no. A few weeks ago a friend of mine who uses the same password everywhere got his paypal compromised and some one from Italy ordered some sweet sweet SSDs. He got refunded in 2-3 hours without having to do anything.
Years ago my bank called me because i got something like 300EU out of my card after using a shitty ATM and they just told me the card is deactivated and i should get a new one and got me my money back.


Yeah WILL is kinda different tho. You can keep on circlejerking the FOOK THE BANKS thing as much as you want.
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:42:33


So storing those "fireworks" the way he did is not? Not a problem then.
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:45:11


Woah maybe... use them correctly? I can make that claim for pretty much everything.
BAN ALL GUNS BECAUSE THEY MIGHT GET SOME ONE KILLED IF HE DOESNT USE THEM CORRECTLY.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:51:37
Maybe read the title of the post?
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:39:54


So is being retarded the correct way to comment on reddit?
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:00:13


I feel like im explaining to some one who is autistic and Bitcoin is his fetish.
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:33:19


You mean just like every one in the crypto world? If you honestly think anyone cares about YOU and not trying to make a quick buck of dumb idiots then you must really lack "life experience" LMAO.
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:45:43
Im not from the US so im not really into fucking my cousin or hitting my wife.
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:04:10
Thats a pretty retarded argument my friend. How will the mugger be able to take the cash out of my cards after he gets them?
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:26:01
And banks are like a safe. If some one goes and robs the bank i get my money back if they are less than 90 000 EU. So why should i hate banks and use something thats pretty much worse in case of theft again? Your comment makes the bank sound way better.
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:33:07


Your question is flawed because im not American. Also even if i was i would have to dig quite a lot to tell her that i beat my wife.
Can you answer my question? Did a bank seo fuck your wife or something?
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:50:39
The fact that you still don't get it makes me worried. I give up. Its like trying to explain something to a toddler.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:01:52
Are you saying he will just order shit online with my card? How will he confirm the orders on the app? Will he steal my phone too? Cut my finger/get my password to also get unlock it? You do also know that i can cancel my card in less than 5 minutes?
Also i love how ignored the part where thinks that MY CASH thats in my pocket has anything to do with the bank LMAO. Its people like you that make me come to this sub.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:16:23
My friend got a huge return from just playing in a Casino. Would you go and try your luck there?


No where. But that doesn't change the fact that i cashed out from greater fools than me and i literally invested 0$ for the coins i had since i mined them for free.
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:43:18
I don't think anyone should trust an investor if he invested in Bitcoin lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:32:50
Yeah im sure hedge funds scour reddit comments to find poker players to hire. My point is that a rando on reddit going "I GOOD INVESTOR I KNOW THING" means basically nothing.
If i listened to people on this sub i would have held trough the ATH and lost so much profit instead of having "weak hands" and selling at 15k. Everyone with a brain has a price they aim for and sell then instead of holding for 10 years.
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:00:22
So basically nothing? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:39:43
You know what they say. Its not a win until you sell but... you kinda lost the money you invested... so its a loss...
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:23:09
Because he has a brain? I mean I held BTC from the time when you could mine with a single gpu and cashed out a little before the ath. Got a shit load of money and fixed most financial problems with my life. Now I can buy all the coins I sold and still have insane profits.
Most people here are retarded bag holders with no plans on when to sell when they could have done what I did. Get money in your pocket and still buy their coins back if the greed is too strong. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:18:42
Oh fuck i forgot everyone here is rich and not coping with the insane losses of their funds because they HOLD FOR LIFE instead of having a sale price to aim for like every sane person would do.
Do you also trust random poker players for financial advice?
I wounder who here is holding my bags?
