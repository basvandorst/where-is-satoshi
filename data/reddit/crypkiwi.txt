I think it also comes down to trust....
Of course people could make mimics.... But people will need something to trust and all the news and infrustructure is going on bitcoin it's branding the currency... People will tend to go to the biggest and most trusted new thing.. and also   how bitcoin is decentralized and the world doesn't know satoshi nakamoto adds so much value in my opinion.

At the moment they are more concerned about eating than the system. The time will come in the next 2 years when they start realizing the fiat system is corrupt and bitcoin is king...

This is how it starts. As long as they are transacting with bitcoin the industry will grow.

Was that American dollar because here down under you will be swallowing a coin. Lol

Yes I think as time goes on the momentum will pick up as people start realizing how good bitcoin really is

It's not 100 years away. The last coin will be mined in 2140. Miners will get the transaction fees after this. The idea is that the price of bitcoin is high and stable by this date and that miners will get money from the transaction fees that everybody will be doing. The miners will still make a decent amount of money hopefully by then because the whole world will be using this.

You miss one main fundamental bitcoin can only reach 21 million coins first and foremost it's currency and fundamentally discentralized. Ethereum is still speculation and there is no cap and also like all the other coins apart from bitcoin to a certain extent CENTRALIZED........ I think people forget why bitcoin was created. It was created because our current fiat system does not work. The math says it will fail us one day. So keep it simple. BITCOIN IS KING

The simplest answer is that it's either going to succeed or fail. Every day that it still exists the more likely it will succeed
