With your credit score, you should still be able to get a loan easily if you have the debt ratio to support it.  You should call a broker and let them do the work for you and have them call multiple underwriters to get an answer before you submit paperwork and pull credit again.  
In the meantime, as the previous poster said, create a bank account for btc transactions only immediately.  Worst case you have to wait until your next two statements.
You are having this problem because all money going in and out of your account must be sourced and subject to verification.  The reason for this is because, they want to avoid fraud and money laundering.  If they loan you the money and Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac decides they do not want to buy the loan from your local bank because of the question marks.  Then the bank is out of luck and has to hold your paper for the lifetime of the loan.

I think more people are giving away bitcoins they already own, rather than buying bitcoins now to give away.

You mean like an option to buy at $600?  Why wouldn't I?  I'm planning to buy at every reasonable dip.  But yeah it's not guaranteed and you have to have faith in the longevity of bitcoin.

"On Dec. 18, Bitcoin prices tumbled to 2,400 yuan (US$400), down from above 4,000 yuan (US$660) on Dec. 16 on China's bitcoin transaction platforms. As of Dec. 22, bitcoin prices consolidated at around 3,500 yuan (US$375) and have yet to return to previous highs."
What a junk article, apparently written by a staff reporter today.  12-25-13.  As of now bitcoin is trading above the purported high of $660.  He used the word "tumbled" and "40%" to emphasize how much bitcoin has dropped without realizing that bitcoin is trading higher today than the amount before it tumbled and dropped 40%.  What an idiot.  Do some current research before publishing online.  Zero cred.

I can't quantify my statement, but just from casual observation. I see a lot of people cashing out bitcoin for gifts.  I think it it should be common knowledge that people need more money to spend during the holidays and have less money for investments during this time of year.

Buying now seems like a smart move.  After the holidays, I personally think we are going to see it go past 1K.  Especially after all the new bitcoin farms come online in Jan and Feb the bitcoins are going to be harder to come by and increase in value every month.  Personally a bought both times when it dipped to the $500 level.  Thoughts?
