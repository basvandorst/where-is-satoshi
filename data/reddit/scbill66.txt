Is there a crypto for that? VanityCoin?

Or not

If charts predicted the future charists would all be millionaires. Charts are great for looking at what has happened.

Maybe we edit the title of this one.

Just saying.....in a Armageddon situation cash will be worthless also.  Those  that have, won’t sell. Those that don’t have  won’t be a able to find what they need (unless they find a school bake sale). 
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:05:22
Second sarcasm vote
These days cash does not work without electricity either. Everything is barcoded and must be read. Registers are basically computers. Stores close when the power goes out. Good luck finding what you need from the public.

Im only trading for NEO right now..how much of that do you have?
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:09:54
Agreed 100%
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:31:47
What I described was really going on at the time, it was not propaganda. If you are referring to the "Only a store of value" statement. I have heard that from core supporters.

Do you think there will be a final revolution (shooting) as the powers that be feel there control slipping away?

That was why I though he was a lunatic, but his article makes sense!

Thank you it finally worked....I waited 3 hours and guess the servers "synced"

Wealth will always come with "followers".  It is human nature to reach for the next rung once a goal is achieved. Even if that means riding the coat tails of those in front of us. I think this is what he meant by leaders, and not a ruling class. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:24:53
Agreed....the main goal should be to promote crypto as a whole. Bitcoin \, Bitcoincash, Ethereum, NEO, Dash, ETC, Iota ...I love them all and hope they all succeed. I don't get the Hate and Vitriol 
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:58:12
10years?...That's an eternity in the crypto space....odds are you will have made a boat load and moved on to something else by then.   I was all bitcoin but now own bitcoin, ethereum, neo, and iota. In 10 years all will probably not own any of the former and own something that has not even been thought of yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:31:59
Yes finally bitcoin will be usable! 
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:06:19
If they have money to buy it.  During the 07/08 crisis gold dumped because people were selling to raise cash. Months later it went up. So while agree with you, there might be a buying opportunity during the crisis, with a pump coming much later. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:44:32
I was so afraid this post would get a bunch of replies agreeing with it (meaning I am a complete idiot who has limited reading compression).  wheew. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:00:23
Crypto is competition for gold, which he pushes. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:49:25
When I first started looking at bitcoin it was going to be the new cash. People were posting about where it could be used, websites were beginning to except it, a couple was trying to travel coast to coast spending only bitcoins, ATMs were popping up. During the Downslide in 2014 I was mostly absent from the scene. When I returned in late 2016 to take another look,  things had changed. Bitcoin was no longer going to be the new cash, but only a store of value. It was being touted as the new gold, and was never supposed to be what you use to buy a cup of coffee. I thought  "what the heck happened"? So, I can see how those who were expecting it for daily transactions could be pissed. Now with 1 fork down and another possible one in November, hopefully everyone can get what they want and we can move on from this argument.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:59:45
I thought he was a raving lunatic but this article hits the bullseye!
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:58:49
���� on all the media attention....I have seen more crypto stories on CNBC, Forbes, Bloomberg and other mainstream sources than ever before. This rise to 4K will just add fuel to the fire. 
Friends that told me bitcoin "is a fad" last year, are now asking me how to buy in lol.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:16:55
Why are bitcoiners so obsessed with putting down others coins? I love all crypto, and hold bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Neo, Iota, and ripple. They are all awesome!

unless the other village has the water, Food, medicine, and wont let it be decentralized.  You can digitally decentralize the water from the lake in a way that everyone is due their fare share, but someone still has to grab a bucket walk to the waters edge and take it. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:53:59
Yes anyone could give you some bitcoin.

Yes, but what is a bitcoin in Zimbabwe dollars...10Q

You can always tell a bitcoin cash hater because they can’t even type the name. Lol

@_date: 2017-11-17 05:15:47
Cost average invest.  If you have 4K put 1K in now. If the price goes up at least you have something in, And if it drops you have dry powder to get in at a low.  Do this in 1k increments

They both can exits together. Lee said he does not like to pick sides, so why is the author asking him to? Pitting one crypto against another does not help the community as a whole,

On another note...I did the same thing to get my coins off coinbase about 1 hour ago and they are still not in the wallet. This is clearly why we need better transaction times.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:30:55
It is not an attack....just blocks moving in another direction. You can participate or ignore it. Sounds perfectly fine to me.

I think I figured out the problem..this time I received an withdrawal verification email where I had to click a link to confirm.

No doubt it will go higher from a bottom when “most of the public shares” his opinion.  He is saying The euphoria that brought it to 20 K may never return. And you have to admit that’s a possibility. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:30:57
Who has their taxes ready in JAN? You don’t have to pay till April, why give your money to the government three months early? I would think just the opposite,  People start getting refunds in late January And can spend them on bitcoin!
