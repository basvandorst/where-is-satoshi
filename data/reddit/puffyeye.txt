Yes, especially concern trolling from people who just found out what crypto currencies were despite my talking about them for years.  I've officially hit "yall said I was crazy!" mode.

This is how things get jinx'd.  Thanks a lot OP!

Where I live it gets to -15 degrees in the winter frequently.  Mining them doesn't seem so bad.

Logged into coinbase, it's all there.  I make them send me a verification code to my phone with every log in.

This is the bullest of shit!!  If you wrote about the regular ole USD I wonder what she would have done?  Probably nothing, but I might be the devil's advocate here.

I use coinbase, and asked our bank beforehand if they had any policies regarding bitcoin purchases.  Everything is good to go as it seems. We use a small local bank.

YAY!  I use them!!

I've been sharing info graphs like "how to explain btc to your grandparents" but this might make people more interested.

Wow, as someone who didn't celebrate growing up, what's the occasion? 
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:50:43
We moved, long story short have a large electric credit.  Less risky time to start mining right?  But, I'm much newer and need help choosing how to mine.  Any recommendations?
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:54:34
I feel bad for not being an active with replies now.  I lurk a lot, but it's very hard, being new to bitcoin for less than a month and not wanting a ton of downvotes and all.
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:10:41
I don't see how it has to be mutually exclusive. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:20:38
How long has that account been open?  Coinbase does have a few levels of verification with caps and limits.

The further BTC can be away from silk road the better.  This is a good thing, not a bad.

My spouse knows all about my crypto investments because if anything were to happen to me they need to know how to access it, pass it down, etc. Also, what if myself &amp; my husband both died in a car crash?  I don't want any of my assets to go into probate.   
I used *our* money to invest so the return is also *ours.*
Not to mention, they have always reminded me to HODL when I got nervous.  I look back at several instances where I wanted to cash out and am so relieved they talked sense into me.
I've seen lots of tips on how to withdraw smartly, but few relationship anecdotes, so I suppose that's just what my take on this is.  I wish you the best and congrats!

Should we alert you about the USD, Euro, and so on?
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:04:40
i set up someone a wallet for their birthday awhile ago, and i think i'm going to do that as a regular thing.  like a crypto grandmother.

2013 vet too. Im not worried, just trying to keep newer folks from making rash choices. I do a bit of trading as well. I truly believe am honest choice of cutting your losses is different from a panic sell. At the same time, i've always considered bitcoin a game of accumulation. Haha not sure if any of that makes sense, but it keeps me sane. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:08:59
we HODL with them and day trade with other exchanges.

My husband wouldn't understand how to spend them. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:46:45
i believe in decentralized currency so that's why i bought in when it was about $ 2000 lower.  granted usd is monopoly money though.
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:19:26
That's crazy. Hey have you ever done DMT?
