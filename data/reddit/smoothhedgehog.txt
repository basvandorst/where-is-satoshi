Formatting, Checksums and Encoding reduce the risk in most cases.  For example the following (uncompressed) addresses are generated from the same 256 bit private key (in Hex): 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF 
* LTC: LWZp7dnmcYC2VpveM2tqFrhWH3xQLgghCD
* BTC: 1CLrrRUwXswyF2EVAtuXyqdk4qb8DSUHCX
* BCH: 1CLrrRUwXswyF2EVAtuXyqdk4qb8DSUHCX
* BTG: GenDijMv769fG8HkCyNyR9bo49cTmZ4cGo
Notice that that the BTC and BCH addresses are identical - this is because the developers hard forked bitcoin with a clone and chose not to change the address formatting.

That's me! That's me!
I also dropped NZ$3k (USD$2k) on 4x Graphics cards back in 2011 not because I wanted to make a profit, but because I was interested in the tech, and if it all went tits up, I would still have four graphics cards.
In hindsight, I should have just bought $3k worth of BTC - would've saved me a hell of a lot in power bills!

Including DHL to NZ it works out to ~NZ$120 each, plus say $5 for nationwide postage.
The deal is for two black, one white, we can flip a coin blockchain hash style if we can't decide on colours

In New Zealand it's ~2.75% for Visa/MasterCard and ~4.5% for AmEx/Diners. Many retailers over here won't accept AmEx/Diners due to the fee. Some even charge a 2.5% premium when paying by CC.

Dunno how you browse, but I tend to open tons of tabs and then read/close, read/close, etc. 20-30+ is not uncommon for me
