Do you have to create a new wallet to use segwit addresses? What type of addresses will be the default?

Thanks to both of you and for the answers!

Wouldn't work because
a) there's no guarantee they would solve the next block to be able to include their transactions
b) if they include their own feeless transactions, that means they would have to exclude other people's paying transactions, losing that income
c) if they do this, it wouldn't be free anyway, since it costs money to mine (main costs being the hardware and electricity)

It depends, but yes, theoretically, it could be changed.

Except it's not. You can't time markets. It could have gone to $30k then crashed. It may have continued up for 2 years, then crashed.

Well, a tiny portion of the BTC as BTC.

If a database schema change is needed to support a new currency pair, you should run away from that exchange, as you can guarantee it's poorly designed and executed.

A script plus however many millions of years it would take to test each one.

Statistically, it is considered impossible.
EDIT: I'm being downvoted, but "statistically impossible" is a thing:

The downvotes probably happened because I hadn't explained.

Are you in the US? How do you do your income taxes?

What? That is sketchy as all getout.

A dollar bill is also worth nothing if all of us think it's worth nothing. What's your point?
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:45:05
Well, it won't go to zero as long as people decide it has worth. Even if it doesn't immediately solve it's problems. Which it can. (Subjective, I know, but it goes both ways.)
