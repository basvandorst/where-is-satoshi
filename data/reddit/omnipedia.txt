Or android, it's even worse. Not because google is bad, they aren't, but because the carriers gate update that patch vulnerabilities. 
Within a few weeks %90 of everyone runs the latest iOS release but for android, more than % 90 of devices are out of date.
@_date: 2016-08-29 04:15:21
By definition they are less secure because they don't have the level of hardware integration an iOS device has.  They are most secure for android in sure, especially if google keeps patching them.
But at the end of the day they are a generic piece of hardware running an unsigned OS.
@_date: 2016-08-29 00:29:07
iPhones are more secure because they have the secure enclave which better prevents running unsigned code.  When a third party is delivering your code it's hard to do that.  Also they have a more focus on it-  all the things people complain about- and call a "walled garden" are security features.  The walls keep malware out.  Unlike android which is rife with it.  Remember most if Apples profit comes from mobile devices, while google loses money on android, it's a defensive move for them.   Apple has more resources to put into security and a strategic advantage in making secure devices. This is why Apple has far fewer vulnerabilities in the wild (and no serious ones) vs googles bad record.
Security is a matter of degrees. Deciding everything is insecure is making the same mistake as assuming things are secure!
Better to choose the solutions that are most effective against the threats you consider most relevant.

It is, read the New Libertarian Manifesto.  Black markets are what took down the USSR.  Pretending like they are evil shows you haven't grasped the nature of the situation- e.g. What Snowden revealed.

Only thing I disagree with are the claims about market share.  There is no evidence that android smartphones have more market share than iPhones.
People like to pretend that Apple is a small player but that wasn't even true at the height of Windows dominance where MSFT had %75 of the consumer market.  Apples %25 was represented as "%3" by "analysts" paid by Microsoft.
Similar fraud happening here. Apple reports actual device sales quarterly in SEC filings.  No such evidence for android sales are reported. Google doesn't, Samsung doesn't either.   But they issue BS press releases of course, claiming absurd numbers of devices, and if course the ideologically oriented like to take them at face value.
The idea that Macs are never hacked because they are obscure was never true. It's not true for iPhones either.

Compared to keys on a server, oh yeah. Part if that is actually security by concealment- a thumb drive is easy to hide.  Even if people know you have Bitcoin (e.g. It's not an obscure fact.)

Oh yes, I am mindful of the failures, and they are orders of magnitude less than android both because Apple has a better process, a better architecture and more ability to ensure things are locked down the way they need to be.
This is objective reality.  I understand for whatever reason people really hate Apple, at its root I think it's jealousy stemming from the days when Apple was relegated to the high end.  But with subsidized devices like phones, they cost the same so there's really no reason to run a phone whose OS was tampered with on a half assed basis by a electronics maker under the direction of a carrier and which is running a release of the base OS that is unpatched and three years old. 
To pretend like the average android is anywhere near as secure as the average iOS device is just silly. Silliness based on prejudice I presume, but it doesn't matter why.  I've given numerous concrete examples of why, and in response I've gotten none.  So there isn't much point in continuing- because I can't be rebutted on the facts so the only thing left is to paint me as a fanboy-- a smear that is profoundly ironic and hypocritical given that it is primarily used by fanboys to attack people who are usually just defending their decisions from unsubstantiated smears.
There really is no basis for an argument against the iPhone and you will notice I've been pointing out relative strengths while the opposition is just bashing iPhones or bringing up Mac examples (irrelevant by definition) or claiming everything is equally insecure (absurd on its face.)
I see this regularly. I understand people don't want to believe that Apple is really doing a good job. 
But it's your data that you are putting at risk by letting insecurity make you choose insecure devices.

I don't know if anyone advocating or defending security by obscurity.  Apples security comes from well thought out practices that are publicly attacked by those nation states as too strong.  You don't see the FBI suing google to unlock an android device.  And that's not because google is more complicit, though I suspect they might be.  All you have to do is replace the OS.

And any real economist knows that bitcoin is very innovative, has grasp otential but is not a foregone conclusion that it will be a success.
A real economists criticism of bitcoin is this: "as an economist I'm not a cryptographer, and thus I cannot know if the cryptography will hold up in bitcoin, but assuming it does, then the economic question is whether the market will accept bitcoin, and it seems certain that this will be the case at least in marginal areas, and quite possible could become the case for a large majority of the population."

I have walked into a random branch of a bank with someone I was selling a very expensive item to, and gotten way more than $9k from the guys checking account  right there in the franchise to pay for it. 
The biggest hassle was proving the sale to the teller so she could fill out the forms to report the transaction to the government. 
They're the money on hand though, in a tiny branch with only 3 tellers.
Anyway, referring to current messed up banking practice is not a good justification of bitcoin practices.

I have never sold BTC this way but I used to sell high value items and sometimes needed to meet strangers.
What I would do is find a well secured bank and meet in their lobby.  So we would do the exchange in front of a security guard who was armed - he didn't know why we were there he was security for the bank- but it would be pretty foolish to try something in a bank (or show up armed to one!)
I would usually arrive 15 minutes before the appointed time, to minimize chances of getting jumped in the parking lot should the buyer have figured out who I was.

Your comment is supremely ironic.  
I've been speculating and investing for over twenty years.
If your point is to say bitcoin is a speculation- I agree. And I'm hedged. 
But you seem to be the one Ho thinks he knows something but really doesn't.
I'll just say your concept if risk is looking at noise and thinking it's risk. The entire world of risk makes that noise like a blade of grass in the real world.
You are way underestimating risk- and I expect you will have no idea how that is true.
Edit:  response confirms you are clueless. Volatility is not risk. Volatility is rate of change over time.  Risk is likely hood if that change going against you. Equating the two is literally saying you lost money when BTC dropped from $1k to 800 recently-- even if you didn't sell.  Which is obviously idiotic.  I've proven this thrice now but you're too stupid to educate.

We are both right.  Bitcoin has a predefined issuance schedule. But I believe the market is valuing it as if all 21 million are already issued and there is no monetary inflation. Of course mining is currently bringing the supply into circulation. It's true that the halvenings have a market effect in the short term but in the long term it's value based on adoption-- I just don't think using it as a currency or for trade is necessary for adoption.  Fixed ultimate total quantity is s feature for a store of value.
@_date: 2017-02-15 15:29:09
Fair enough, wish I had heard that a year ago. Back then I didn't really believe SegWit was a solution. Now I do.  That change came with its release on testnet last April.
I'm. It sure what will persuade the big blockers now.
SegWit happens to also allow big blocks of SegWit data.
There's nothing to object to, as I see it.
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:13:23
Ah, but your answer is very helpful.  When you say inverting then takes 2^n, that's 2^n operations?
So if you take a relatively small/short version of the hash and randomly try values you could find out statistically the number of operations to find a collision and invert, right?
And that would be the random oracle model. 
Doesn't prove there's not a vulnerability leading to a shortcut, but does give evidence of the difficulty.
So from this it seems that any hash function in use would be better paired with another one.  E.g.:  if BTC used sha256(scrypt ()). Then a vulnerability in either one of those would be backstopped by the other, right?
Just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly.
Thanks for the explanation!

Of course it depends on how many you mean by "everyone".   If bitcoin becomes a successful worldwide way of saving or investing, even if it doesn't move much (e.g. Low circulation) it will do well.
Just being a savings account for people that is immune to inflation is enough to make it a viable investment for at least another 40 years. 
Of course if "everyone" remains a small number of people and/or a better solution comes along it might be a bad investment.

I don't see anyone making bad decisions, except letting being on the losing side stop them.  I was a big blocker. I think we lost. SegWit is still good stuff, and it solves the problem so let's get it adopted.
I'm not tuning anything out.

What's more important is bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:40:39

But what's important is that any crypto system that can't survive a hostile government is not strong enough.  We have to assume all actors are going to be hostile and find solutions that counter their moves.

I think you misunderstood my question.  I want to know what software these pools are running for their full nodes, not whether they glad SegWit support.
My hypothesis is that the largest pools in china are 2-3 releases behind current, but are running core code.
As core releases versions, pretty soon you will have to be running really old code or switch to non-core code.
All of the non-core code is lower quality than core so far and I think the pools are very conservative.

Why are you unwilling to compromise?  Or are you saying, you're unwilling to support going to 2mb blocks with SegWit? (I might be misunderstanding you.) 
I'm curious about that.  IIRC last spring core said that SegWit would go into beta and then the next quarter (eg: last summer) they would support 2mb blocks... but they never did. That right there feels like the biggest failure on their part in this whole thing.
And the blocks do seem full, though I haven't had any trouble with transactions.

By your argument Linux is closed source as well because there are closed source UI packages and components and drivers and of course the whole google apps and UI layer us closed source and also there are closed source packages out there and I bet I could find a closed source Linux kernel, GOU violations be damned, to insist Linux were closed source-- if I were going to be consistent with your ideological and dishonest argument.
Your bitching about open ssl being open source Is not relevant-- nevermind the fact that a Apple wrote their own crypto and open sourced it.  The fact they ship openssl on macOS as a convenience to users means Apple is "taking but not giving."  E.g. Your ideology is more important than the facts.
You're just a stallmanite who can't even be honest about the situation and is in denial that Apple open sourced their operating system.
Further the most popular open source operating system in the world is Darwin running in billions of devices. There's no evidence Linux has cracked even a billion.
And no, android is not hardened because it's software and hardware layers come from separate companies- so you can't do things like sign the software and validate that in the hardware, in a secure fashion.
You don't understand the situation but you want to believe Apple is bad so you're lying.  Fuck off.

Google and Facebook both will use data they collect on any platform to target ads on any other platform.

You're using the term intrinsic wrong. The arguments that industrial uses give gold an intrinsic value are the same ones that its use as a store of value gives it intrinsic value.  Read Murray Rothbards "What has the government done with our money" for an explanation of what gives money value.
There are very few rare metals in the world with the properties of gold that make them good for use as money.  Silver is the closest competitor.  Gold beats silver because it is more valuable per unit.  Platinum is also good and might be better but gold has more historical adoption, and thus network effects.  Palladium, Rhodium and even Uranium are used in various ways as investment metals, so there's nothing magical about gold.  All of these metals have industrial uses too, but their use as store of value is not related to their industrial use.
Bitcoin is not capable of visa scale right now. It may be in two years though. But that doesn't matter. Consumer adoption is what's needed first and for that to happen the price has to be stable or going up and the system has to be stable. It has nothing to do with merchants.
@_date: 2016-12-25 22:38:05
Golds intrinsic value is the exact same as bitcoins. To say one has it and the other doesn't is to confuse your feelings for reality.
What gold has that bitcoin doesn't have, is an industrial use. Both electronics, jewelry and other uses create non-investment demand.  Bitcoin has some of this (e.g. Use in remittances, or as an intermediary currency for buying alt coins) but it is far behind gold.
When a primary use is as a store if value, being a store of value is what gives it "intrinsic value"- it's only because people value it that it has intrinsic value.
@_date: 2016-12-25 22:33:25
Agreed. I think all of those uses and ones we aren't aware of yet are potential future uses, but not yet drivers of the value of bitcoin. I think a lot of them will happen in chains other than bitcoins chain. 
Th core team is being careful in order to preserve the integrity of bitcoin, which is good and important, but it also means bitcoin is going to be slower to innovate.

@_date: 2011-09-09 12:54:11
You're operating from a fundamental misunderstanding of economics.  Government spending comes via taxes and inflation.  This money comes out of the economy in the first place.  The more government spends the less money businesses have at the end of the year when they say "Hmm, how much expansion (i.e. jobs) can we afford in the upcoming year."
It is ludicrous to say that government handouts to political cronies (Which is what that "stimulus" bill was) for pointless programs helped the economy.   The economy has worsened and has gotten worse than they said it would if we *didn't* spend that money. (so at he very least their economics are nonsense.) 
You shouldn't believe what politicians tell you.  After all, if they were right, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place.
PS-  We are currently in an economic depression.  That's another of the bits of nonsense they tell you.  But you'll never be able to see how they're wrong if you don't learn enough economics.

I give you credit for recognizing that you're making an argument from authority.  But I must point out that this is not simply a weak argument, it is, in fact, a logical fallacy.
You point out that here are a large number of people, so-called "authorities" and books written by these people who are political hacks spreading a sort of economic religion to support their political ideology and calling it "Economics".  That's true.  This is also why argument from authority is a fallacy.
A real science allows predictions. It supports hypothesizes that are consistent, and supports measuring results and then updating hypothesizes to be consistent with the results.
The so-called "economics" that the neo-keynesians preach does not work this way. When they advocate policies that cause damage (like the creation of the housing bubble) they pretend like they didn't after the fact.  Or, in the case of the "stimulus" they engage in the equivalent of "the patient died because we did not apply sufficient leeches!"
Mises and Heyak were able to accurately predict the fall of the soviet union, the great depression, etc.  mises.org and Ron Paul predicted the housing bubble and then crash, in 2001.  Krugman, et al, were advocating FOR a housing bubble between 2003-2006 and claiming there was no bubble in 2006-2008. 
He advocated for the "Stimulus" which is based on a theory that Fredric Bastiat disproved centuries ago (The broken window fallacy)... and not surprisingly this policy has hurt he economy.
The correct way to measure inflation is via a measure of the growth of the money supply.  Full Stop. 
If you want to talk about the changes in consumer prices, that's fine, that's a separate topic.  CPI doesn't measure them, though, because CPI is manipulated/fraudulent. 
By changing the definition of inflation, and then manipulating the CPI, the government and fake economists like krugman, et. al. are able to pretend that policies that damage the economy are helping, etc.
But, since it is so fundamentally obvious, they can't pretend that inflation has no effect.  You recognize that monetary inflation results in a rise in prices.  Simply project deficit spending forward-- increased debt, increased interest on that debt, requiring ever increasing amounts of debt growth, eventually will go vertical as all exponential processes must.   Inflation is rationalized to let politicians get away with it, when they get away with it, they will use it to put off til tomorrow dealing with the problems of today. Bernanke is famous for talking about dropping money from helicopters.  Ultimately this results in zimbabwe.  Always has... can you give me a reason why it won't always will?
The US dollar has been destroyed by hyperinflation how many times already? 2? 3? People forget, or blame it on the war that was the proximate cause but the mechanism and the event and the cause are the same.  Why think it is different now?  Especially when the best proxy for measuring inflation-- gold-- is starting to go parabolic, just like debt and money supply growth. 
Rather than arguing with me, I suspect a more fruitful expenditure of time would come from reading "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt.   It is a short book and you can find it free online... the main point is, read that, and see if you find that his arguments make sense or not.
I believe you have an open mind, and I believe that if you'll expose yourself a little bit to this other viewpoint you'll see what I'm saying.
But I can't construct the quality and precision that Hazlitt has already done, and so reading him would be the most efficient way.

Krugman, being a political propagandist, is spreading the ideology that inflation is always good.  For them, inflation is always good because it allows governments to spend without limit.  In the real economy, inflation is bad.  It drives up costs to consumers and businesses faster, starting with raw goods, than wages or manufactured goods can go up in price, meaning that company profits suffer and consumers suffer.  Meanwhile it distorts the market because "inflation" as reported by the government is not actual monetary inflation (that comes from printing money) but fabricated "price index" which is easily manipulated and which is the basis for krugman's lie that prices haven't gone up since 2008.  Anyone who does the weekly grocery shopping or buys gasoline knows this is a lie. 
Further, in order to support the "let my political friends spend as much as they want without regard to the consequences" brand of economics, he has to pretend like deflation is bad.
A given economy where ether are advancements in science and productivity will experience deflation if the money supply is held steady.  These advancements will lead to a higher standard of living, and result in an increase in the purchasing power of money.  However, those who argue against "deflation" do so making the claim that all of the value of these advancements should instead go to the government to spend! They do it by printing money, giving the government the value, and denying the populace the value of scientific and productivity advancements. 
That's how we can have a major scientific revolution like the ubiquity of computers, that should produce a massive boost in quality of life, but not experience it... the whole increase in value was absorbed via government inflation.
In a deflationary scenario, people don't "hoard currency" to the point that it hurts the economy.  This doesn't make sense and is easily disproven. 
It doesn't make sense because people still need to buy things. When the value of their currency is going up (purchasing power rises) they can buy more with less, and so they have more affordability for luxuries and thus are more likely to buy things they wouldn't otherwise buy. Further the idea that saving is bad (what he called "hoarding") is also nonsense. You know he know's he's lying when he uses a loaded term like hoarding instead of saving.   Saving is the basis of capitalism.  You save and then you can make big purchases.  You save and then you can start a business. The act of saving involves either investing in stocks, which helps the economy, or putting it in a bank to be leant out to businesses which helps the economy. 
Finally it is easy to disprove the claim that deflation is bad.  Personal computers, due to Moores Law have been getting radically cheaper on a constant-price-performance basis for the past 20 years.  Do people, knowing that they can wait 18 months and get a radically better computer for the same money, never buy a computer?  Or do they buy a computer every 19 months or so?  The answer is the latter. Certainly some people may keep their computers longer, but the economy of the computer manufacturing industry s not suffering because nobody will buy computers.... as Krugmans' theory requires you to believe. 
Krugman is wrong, he's peddling nonsense, and it is time for every rational person to stop paying attention to him. 
It is not surprising he gets bitcoin wrong, his only purpose is to bash bitcoin because it isn't issued by a central bank, and cannot be inflated to profit his cronies. 
Krugman is not an economist.  Remember, this is the guy who advocated that we have a housing bubble, and at the peak of the bubble claimed there was no bubble and then after it burst advocated that we engage in a "stimulus" and then after the stimulus hurt the economy claimed it was because it was too small.
He's consistent with taking whatever positions supports more government spending, but he's never taking the position that is consistent with economics, or whats' actually best for the economy.

I think it is unfair to Keynes to call what they advocate Keynesian.  In truth, Keynes only advocated inflation during rough times, and that the government should deflate when times are good to keep a steady money supply.  Keynes understood the dangers of inflation and thus basically agreed with Hayek most of the time.... it was just when things were bad that they disagreed.
However, politicians are using Keynes to pretend like what they are doing-- which clearly benefits them by letting them spend as much as they want without raising taxes-- is somehow "good economics". 
I don't know what most economists think.  I think there are a lot of political types like krugman who represent themselves as economists but who don't actually practice the science of economics. 
I don't think Keynes was as opposed to deflation as the neo-keynesian people are.  There is a reason he cautioned against inflation and advocated deflation to balance out the inflation.  But I'm open to being proven wrong (and maybe I'm connecting two periods of different thinking form Keynes.) 
Anyway, I think one of the errors is that people think that Obama, Bush, Krugman, Bernanke, et. al. are educated about economics and advocating things that have a basis in scientific reality.  They may have gotten an eduction, but it wasn't in science, and they are not advocating rational, defendable positions. 
They're advocating ideological ones.

One thing I did that I think helped me is dollar cost average. 
%100 of investing skill is controlling your emotions and not making decisions based on FOMO. I literally had an order to buy $10,000of AAPL at basically $0.24 a share that would be around $8M now.  I did worse with bitcoin because I was I to "libertarian money" before bitcoin was announced and found bitcoin interesting in 2010.
You have to judge your performance on the investments you make, not the ones you miss.  Not making that AAPL investment also means I skipped a lot of other decisions using that same criteria that would have turned out bad.
If you can honestly say you will keep buying if the price drops to $1,200 then you're ok.  Just dollar cost average over a year.  
You should be confident the price will be higher in 5 years, not in 5 days.  Lots of people bought at $900 and sold at $400 last time and then didn't spend the next two years buying at $200-300.
I know lots of people who made the right play on bitcoin 6-7 years ago and now are millionaires. But you can't let jealousy drive your thinking.

Yes, you creationists claim that your beliefs are based on science, but they do not hold up to scientific scrutiny.
This is also why you continue to support the argument from authority fallacy here, rather than address the fundamental errors I pointed out in Krugers claims. 
You can lie about his "prize" and his education, but even if you were right, you'd still be engaging in the argument from authority fallacy.
Of course, if you understood anything about economics, you could make an economic argument. 
It is the profound ignorance of people like you that lets krugman get away with his nonsense, and it also is only among people like you that he is considered an authority.
Simply taking him at face value allows any rational person to see the fallacies he's perpetuating. He's not even consistent with himself.

Stress comes from trying to time the market.  Here's a better tragedy- just buy, every week, a small amount you can afford to lose.  Like a cup of coffees worth. So if it goes to zero, it was just coffee.  Whether it's up or down that $5 will buy more or less, and you will basically be getting the average price over the period as a result.
Then, in advance, decide when you are going to sell.  I sold a little for random things so if it crashes I feel like I made a little money.  We are up %100 since that time.
When we are at 10X my average entry price I will sell ten percent of my holdings.   We aren't too far from that right now, but the stressful time was when I started and I was putting more than coffee money into it.  This is why you just put coffee money in for the early time.

It's not having a different opinion, it's being irrational. I once talked there about a resource trust that was paying around %7 a year consistently and shared the idea of putting %95 of an investment in that and using the remaining %5 to engage in speculation.  They weren't having any of it- speculation is evil, I was throwing my money away, etc.  even though this is a hedged situation and losing the entire speculation would have resulted in around a %2 gain....
Actual results:  speculation returned %100, and the trust returned %10 that year.

Velocity of money is one of those things that hand-waving political "economists" like to use to make their theories seem to make sense.  You cant' really measure it objectively, and so it's best not to assume too much about what it does. 
For instance, one of the errors people make is confuse money for value.   The economy could be in a depression, with the value of goods being sold declining each year, but due to inflation the prices, and velocity of money, skyrocket.   But that doesn't meant he economy is healthy.
Poor economic figures, like GDP, would show a thriving economy in that situation, even though it is actually declining.

How can a contract be legitimate when the participants didn't consent?  In real contracts, the participants must consent, it's part of the law.

It may be the beginning of the end-- the beginning of an agorist market as described in SEK3's "New Libertarian Manifesto" (worth a read!)
It was the black market that brought down the USSR, ultimately.

Consider that the FOMC (part of the federal reserve charged with "price stability") may be that seller.  
Here's what they do with the gold market:
When gold is flat or rising, they accumulate gold over months, until they have a stockpile.  (In this case, it's not actual gold but gold futures.)
Then when gold starts to rally, they sell into it to kill the rally.  If gold is too high, they dump a lot on the market all at once to bring it down.
As a result, after hitting $2,000, gold is around $1,200 right now, when it should be closer to $3,000.
They've lost billions doing this, but they don't care, they have $80B a month to work with in new money.
Given that Bitcoin is only a $10-$15B market cap right now, they could run the price up slowly, buying and buying and buying and buying, then dump it all at once. 
They don't care if they lose money, and it's a "win" if they take out a competitor to the dollar (on which they have a monopoly,y don't forget.)
They aren't selling yet, I think they're still accumulating their position...
But I'm certain this will be the next thing BTC has to deal with.... and it will be brutal. 
Their goal is to destroy BTC, and they are going to make everyone feel a lot of pain in the process.

If you find a paper wallet with 100BTC and you return 95BTC to the original owner (assuming you can find them)... how have you not done them a huge favor?  Getting most of their lost money back is a good deed, even if you do keep %5.
Of course, what the portion you keep is by definition a grey area.  Only returning %5 and keeping %95 is not nearly as good a deed and most people might feel bad about it, but at the same time, it's still turning a %100 loss into a %95 loss. 
Frankly, when money is lost, returning  most of it or the majority of it should always count as a good deed!

In my experience, most of the "imperfections" are errors in the person's understanding of what money is, rather than problems with bitcoin.

Prove it, or admit you're a liar.  There is no evidence Apple has ever done what you claim, and they always cite a specific reason for rejecting Apps.   So, either you know you're a liar and you don't care, or you've got some evidence to back up your claim.

Computers make the money to buy them deflationary.  That is to say, if you hold your dollars for 18 months they'll buy twice as much computing power.
Yet people still buy computers.
This is what the inflationist can't seem to wrap their head around.  I don't think most people give it a second thought before buying their computer. 
The idea that deflation causes people not to spend money is a myth perpetuated by inflationists who profit from inflation (and various forms of other people who believe the inflationists, usually because they want a part of that money, usually by it being spent on some government program they support.)

There are no downsides to a deflationary currency, all of the ones you mentioned are made up by inflationists to try and justify the theft that is inflation.   Simple logic and economics will prove this to be the case, the problem is, people often believe what they are told rather than think about it. Deflation is a feature, not a bug, and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they are talking about or has an agenda based in stealing from you.

How can stealing from others to put that money where it benefits you (either directly or by putting it into things you value) allow people to live "peacefully together"?  Taxes are collected under threat of violence - jailtime and death if you try to escape jail (and lets be honest, jail is a form of torture which also includes a lot of physical abuse.) 
If you recognize that taxes are collected using violence, you can understand why people who want to live peacefully are against tax. 
Government can exist without tax, the same way any legitimate service provider does- by charging for its services.

The important question is why.  There are many reasons that the app could be removed, and "hating bitcoin" is not one of them.
Apple removes apps because they put the user at risk or use private APIs.  Without a copy of the letter Apple sent coin base (citing specifically the rule they broke) we can't know why.
Coinbase not releasing this letter fosters the anti-apple hatred that so many want to spread, by taking a mundane issue and turning it into some sort of Cause.

People who talk about "Deflationary Spiral" when talking about a delfationary currency are conflating two completely different effects: monetary delfation with economic deflation.  One is when the value of money increases over time, the other is when the size of a market decreases over time.  They are phenomena that have no relationship.  (except that they rarely happen together.) 
Generally the people who oppose monetary deflation are people who want the government to be able to spend without limit and really don't give a damn how many poor people are made poorer by fatcats in washington spending money for their own benefit.  
Of course they attack bitcoin and I think the above mentioned conflation is intentional, because they want to pretend like economics is on their side.
It isn't.  Even Keynes wasn't a "keynesian", because he advocated monetary deflation in periods of prosperity to balance out the monetary inflation he advocated in periods of depression.  (he may have been wrong, but he's far more honorable than those who use his name in modern times.)
