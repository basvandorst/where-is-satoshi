BTC price is surely a factor and processing power is increasing exponentially - generally getting more bang for your buck every year, right? Surely BTC price could reach a point where it would be worth filling a warehouse with extreme hashing power, solar power and batteries for continous 24 operation? 
Expensive outlay initially but that's fine if successfully popping out coins that cover the investment quickly enough. As new advanced processers become available you sell off the old gear and update. Rinse and repeat.
On a another note - couldn't people charge their Tesla at one of the many free charge points available in major cities, drive home and power their mining rigs off it? Free electricity to mine coins that could potentially cover cost of the rig and the Tesla. Just thinking out loud.

So there's like ten people in the queues? Hardly thousands clammering for cash as implied. You will see queues at ATMs like this at 1:30am in the morning in most cities in Europe.
"Already 500 out of 7000 ATMs in Greece are now out of money". SO? What is the figure normally? It's far from unusal for ATMs to run out of cash - particularly at the weekend. I would have thought it would be much higher.
"The bank run is real."
You've provided no evidence of this. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:22:29
Bit late to the party aren't you? As I said OP didn't provide proof for his claims. Is that no longer required for posts or is this just a gossip and speculation site?
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:32:58


So what is the purpose of OP's post? 'Bank run is real now'?


But that's what OP posted as evidence. I'm questioning that.


And yet ...
"There are reports of lines at ATMs across Greece. I have relied on Twitter to get current reports, and the general tone is that there are lines at 3:00 a.m. local time. 
"However, it’s Friday night/Saturday morning, and the Greeks don’t start dancing until midnight. 
"Perhaps it’s not a bank run but just a few more late night revelers than usual. The photographs posted show orderly lines, with no signs of panic."

@_date: 2015-06-27 16:38:45
Again - you've provided no evidence. Unsubstantiated claims and a few pics of people queuing for ATMs. So yes, you're correct. Nothing to see here.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:58:09
There are problems in Greece. Nobody is denying that. I have a problem with you making unsubstantiated claims. 
Your evidence is photographs of people queuing on Friday night/Saturday morning.  Where is the evidence that is anything more than a few late night revellers getting cash out? Scenes you will see all over Europe. Do you get it?


Where did you get this figure? What is the figure normally?
You can keep making snarky comments but it won't change the fact that your post is at best gossip and speculation upvoted by circle-jerkers with hardon thinking bitcoin, of which I'm a massive fan, can solve Greece's economic problems.

You're assuming 100% response rate to this 'call to action'. You really think 90,000 people give a fuck or use Netflix? If these sort of things worked, and I've accepted already (multiple times) that it was a flawed *idea*, it highly unlikely everyone in the subreddit would actually contact Netflix. I've already referred you to my revised post on the matter aimed solely at Netflix customers. If they wish to pay for Netflix using their hard-earned bitcoins they are entitled to contact Netflix and ask them to consider doing so.

What you're describing is natural. This sub used to be like that - more fun and had people who were really passionate about bitcoin technology and could see the potential. Now it has gone mainstream and there are lot more people just out to make a fast buck and obsessed with the price.
If dogecoin was to start going mainstream you can be sure that sub would go the same way. It is similar to reddit in general. 
As it has become more popular it has lost some of things that I used to love about it. Comments for example have really gone downhill - mostly people trying to be funny, act like 4chan or post memes. Front page used to dominated with politics, science and really interesting stuff...now mostly jokes, advice animals, cats and TIL.

Make a note of the word 'customer service'. Look there is no point being dicks about this. I and am sure many other customers of services such as netflix would like to pay in bitcoin for my services. Asking customer services if they can pass this desire on to management or why I can't do this doesn't seem like spamming to me. Customer services is surely there for this reason - to answer queries from customers. Seems like a legit query to me. Perhaps there is a better method to this but right now I can't see how.

OK. I'm just thinking out loud here but surely it costs very little for a company to accept bitcoin payments and the rewards for the company would be them having next-to-nothing transaction charges. Isn't that the business case right there? 


I don't see people enquiring about whether would consider adopting a preferred payment method  and possibly pointing out the benefits as spamming. It might get the attention of management.

Facebook also owns Whatsapp. You can be almost certain intel agencies have a backdoor.

"The most important answer is yes – bitcoin is entirely taxable and no it is not anonymous.
The beauty of bitcoin is that it’s distributed and there’s a public record of every transaction.  Thus, every transaction is always recorded.  It’s like an accountant’s wet dream – debits and credits everywhere.  Some may say that their identities are “hidden” or “obscured,” but that really doesn’t matter unless you’re actively trying to hide the fact that you earned income.  If so, then we’re talking about something entirely different.  That is tax fraud – plain and simple.  You’re attempting to defraud the government of its fair share of your gains."

I don't think they were 'stuck' at all. They had 'feature phones' with much more advanced functionality than in the west and didn't have the need/desire to swap and possibly lose those features. Smartphones are still playing catchup in many areas. It also seems that Japanese consumers are more accepting of new tech (like qr codes that never took off in the West) and make use of it. Just because it works there and they still use it doesnt mean they are stuck with old tech just that it works for them. They've also had phones with features that were successful in Japan but never made it beyond the country and features which are only now being added to smartphones in the West.

Smartphones perhaps but Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) launched the world's first first generation (1G) mobile phone service in Tokyo as a car phone in 1979. 
Also wasnt the US also quite late when it came to widespread use of cellphones?

What are you talking about? You clearly haven't read the article and if you have you don't understand much about global politics or international affairs. 


Yeah, you got me. I'm trying to prop up the ruble by correcting some idiot who thinks 'Eurasia' in a headline means Putin wants a currency union with countries using the Euro ie: the EU countries - who have imposed sanctions against his country. Yeah. That's it. Cover is blown.
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:14:19
What is hilarious is people see Eurasia in the headline, don't read the article and think Putin is talking about a currency union with the European Union merging the Ruble and Euro.
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:11:37
Did you have to add in Russia? It's obvious when I said:


Meanwhile people who clearly haven't read the fucking article think this is about Putin calling for a currency union with the Euro.
@_date: 2015-03-22 12:59:42
This has NOTHING to do with the Euro
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:41:31


This has absolutely **nothing** to do with the Euro. 
Try reading the actual article. It is about a union with Kazakhstan and Belarus. Two countries on Russia's borders.
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:51:45
No, it isn't. Seeing as Putin is calling for it, nobody was confused that this is about Russia and I said 'with' the other two countries involved. The confusion came from those who haven't read the article and thought this was about EU countries and the Euro. Judging by your '[Iknowright? Lol :D]( comment in response to [retarded comment]( - you also thought this was about the Euro and are trying to compensate.
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:30:10
Top comment. Hmm. What do you find funny? Seriously.

@_date: 2015-03-22 00:38:20
Thanks. However you've even gone to the trouble of linking to XE and to all others who haven't read beyond the headline - this would seem to lend credibility to bullshit comment. It appears that  isn't the only one in these comments who saw the 'Eur' part in the Eurasia and automatically thought this was about the Euro.

I ask because you said you 'lost 8 coins by selling them at $171'. Then the price went to $189 and you felt sick. I don't understand why you consider this to be losing 8 coins when you bought them for 60-120. How can this make you sick? You bought coins for 60-120 and sold for a massive increase at 171. How did you lose?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:17:25


Yeah, what about to foreign countries?


Not all. Many charge.
"UK banks offer free ATMs in their branches and some other locations, while fee charging machines tend to be located in petrol stations, bars and newsagents."
Having fast payment techniques such as NFC and security like chip and pin is irrelevant. These could be used with bitcoin.


You are generalising. It depends on the bank and the account.

You think that is something? Wait until you see what is to come. Since everyone else acting like the Oracle I will do the same. Here is my prediction: The price will spike to a record high of 882 before the next major slump - similar to April. It will then climb back again. Mark my words.

You're being unfair there. "Grassroot under the table operation"? There is nothing under the table about it. Just because something isn't approved/sanctioned by the government doesn't mean it is bad or sits 'in the dark shadows of the internet'. There appears to be little involvement from governments at the moment and bitcoin is doing just fine. Nothing shadowy about it despite the picture being painted by the MSM a month ago. That uneducated perception is changing. You are saying if governments don't get involved it won't work. It is working because governments aren't involved.

What happens when government and the media start saying that bitcoin is only used by terrorists and drug dealers? The people may not like their government but they generally dislike terrorists more.

Not being overly dramatic - bitcoin is a huge threat - lets not kid ourselves.

Title/headline is a bit misleading, no? "Bitcoin is falling..." sounds like Bitcoin is crashing. Nothing of the sort. Bitcoin rocketed passed 1,000 and has now stabilised a bit and is hanging around the 1,000 mark - what is the big deal here? Wasn't this expected? Doesn't this follow the trend/pattern? Dramatic headlines 'Bitcoin is falling' are irresponsible. Personally, the greedy devil in me would love to see a real fall to 500 or something so I can dive in again and scoop up more coins. I don't see that happening but this is why it doesn't really matter. As soon as there is a significant drop lots of people will jump in and buy again and push price price back up. A while ago Kevin Rose implied that he sold his coins. Now it appears that he only sold some and kept some. That wasn't made clear at the time. Why was that? People listen to you Mr Rose and it would be appreciated if you gave greater clarity and took more care with your announcements. But I digress. The financial gains are great but so is the community that has sprung up around the coins, the innovations, new businesses and freedom from banksters.  But people need to stop the obsessive watching of the charts and freaking out at every minor dip. Keep some bitcoins tucked away (if you don't need the cash right now), spend some this Xmas on gifts and be merry. As has been said many times we are in for a rollercoaster of a ride. Everyone knows that. Personally I am enjoying it  - whether it shoots up or dips - it's all good.

The first brothel or prosititute to start accepting bitcoin is going to be very successful.  I can see the day when cellphones touch using NFC and then you fuck. The oldest profession in the world meets the newest form of payment. Hmmm....I wonder how would this work legally? Would it still be prostitution if no actual money was involved? Would be difficult to prove the client paid for sex. I see bitcoin revolutionising prostitution. 
Edit: It would make the job safer (not having to carry cash) and less chance the prostitute would get ripped off. Amsterdam is bound to lead the way with this. Same with buying weed.

Don't get me wrong I want this to happen but you're implying that most people aren't easily led sheep. The currrent evidence suggests otherwise. The bailouts happened.

I agree with your title it is not consumer friendly yet...it is early days.
However: 


I didn't have to verify my identity or link to a bank account. I bought at an online market and sent to my wallet. The 'difficult' part was making sure (as best I could) that, once bought, they are secure but I guess that's to be expected when you become the bank. The process from market to my wallet took about five minutes. Overall though you are correct it does need to get easier and this will happen.
