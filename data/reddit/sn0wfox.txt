I agree that some of the Chinese exchanges have faked volumes, OKCoin was caught red-handed a while ago, and Huobi's number is just ridiculous. However, I agree with  that BTC China is not faking the volume, if you look at their volume in the past few months, the number is 1/10 of Huobi and OkCoin, I don't see a reason they'll pull that? And plus, it is China's first Exchange and have been reputable!

But wasn't Huobi's trade volume reported as fake, despite their CEO denying the rumour? Heaps of people have been talking about that with evidence and all.

Not exactly. For your bitcoins to remain secure you rely on the network and people around the world to keep their computing resources on the Bitcoin network. Don't get me wrong, I like bitcoin too.

OKCoin got caught red handed that they were faking volume, I personally think that Huobi is also doing the same but in a smarter way...they'll get caught sooner or later!

In short, they are just like OKCoin - "faking volume", but just better at it. Soon or later, they'll get caught! Just a matter of time!
