Just read that the bch guys will say it's because of txn volume reductions.  Interested to hear what BTC guys say.

Or they buy it on an exchange.  Sellers have no idea who the purchaser is when trading on an exchange.    
I don't understand OP's logic.

I agree, average Joes really want to own a whole one. I've had numerous conversations where people say they want in,  but it's too expensive. I always let them know they can buy partial amounts but they aren't interested.

If you  really want crypto to be truly adopted globally it will have to provide credit mechanisms.  Once crypto becomes popular, and commercially accepted banks will *absolutely* start providing credit.   
It will be a great day when banks start providing crypto credit because that will show widespread adoption and usage of crypto.

 But also Crypto purchasing power can't be reduced at the whim of a government.

It ain't that country any more. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:11:48
The poorer you are the more reduced buying power hurts.   
I'm not saying Crypto is perfect, just pointing out that there are both pros &amp; cons for the 'people'. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:42:08
No, but people do pull their house off the market if they can't, at least, break even.  Same with miners.  
Then reduced supply will bring prices back up to break even.... which will include electricity costs.

Very cool site, thanks. 
Using this &amp; looking at Hashrate - really big increase in the 'Unknown' category starting  Jul 8.

Does it hold actual BTC, or is it a derivative?  
Edit: looks like a derivative which does jack shit for buoying the price: "develop a range of investment products that track bitcoin and other virtual currencies."

"I'll watch it closely" is what people who've never been in a bubble say.
When you're actually participating *in* the bubble it's a whole different ballgame.
"It went up 5%... do I buy? Is this just the tail end of the pump? Is it going to continue or will id dump?" That's the reality... you have no idea what it will do next, no matter how closely you 'watch it'.

QE is, effectively, taxation.  It's basically curtailing your spending by reducing purchasing power.
