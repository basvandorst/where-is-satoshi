nice try, dubious person.

Remember this one guys..
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:33:57
That's just 4 reasons though 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:11:36
Wtf happened to this sub. Seriously...wtf!
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:12:44
God dammit! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:52:38
That’s actually a coin too
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:12:09
Glad you’re still around. ��
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:23:07
Then stop posting that shit. You're confusing noobs. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:15:46
That's not the right mindset to help grow confidence in crypto for new users. I've been in crypto since 2012, just voicing my irritation at the fact that he posted a link as sarcasm but can easily be taken as fact by newbies. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:45:01
My head...
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:21:06
Fuck that guy

me too!

This. People who think splits / hard forks are a good thing are being delusional. Bitcoin came to be worth 50+ billion in large part because people could store and transfer non-trivial amounts of money without having to trust anyone. If they can't trust the reliability of the network anymore, that promise disappears quickly and so does the value. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:44:52
This is bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:28:04
We can keep talking about that capitol hill sign guy, or talk about more important stuff... like the upcoming potential hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:09:25
Yeah this is concerning to say the least. Its impossible for every single business or user of in the bitcoin space to prepare and act on this information. Do they really expect everyone to read this announcement? People will lose money and there's going to be chaos if a fork happens.

Will BCC instantly have the market adoption, the saturation through exchanges and wallets that BTC has earned through the past 7+ years? 
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:04:53
Contact exchanges directly 
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:17:25
Imagine how many of these BTCs are actually lost forever?
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:37:08
No satisfying answers so far. Can anyone ELI5?
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:04:00
But but .. he just caused the price to crash /s

MT4 (MetaTrader 4) is a popular trading platform among Forex traders, primarily due to it's user-written plugins capability called "Expert Advisors" or EAs. There's a huge community of traders/programmers/nerds who have written EAs to trade the forex market. One of my favorites is [Steve Hopwood's Forex Trading Forum]( . He initially contributed to the forum called [Forex Factory]( which is one of the largest forums in this market.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:12:52
Right? As if this sub has a crystal ball.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:32:56
Now imagine Bitcoin QR codes embedded in images shared on social media such as "Like/Share/Donate if you wish to help this poor girl in Somalia".

In a day or two, $1309 USD will buy 1 BTC

There are no such rules. Don't think of it as a stock, think of it as another currency, like euros or rupees. It is designed to be scarce and thus it is a deflationary currency as opposed to the ones issued by governments. Being that it's an internet currency and internet being an international system by nature, it is treated more like gold by regulators in their respective jurisdictions. 
So you can buy (or convert your US dollars into) Bitcoins for a portion of your savings that you are comfortable with. You can buy as little as a few dollars worth or a few billion, there's no law that says you can't, unless there is where you are. 
You can also say trade with as little as you want. Gdax is a good exchange. Also check out kraken, Bittrex and others. See sidebar. 
Edit: correct inflationary to deflationary. Add info about day trading exchanges

Chicken and egg problem. Get some people to post their ads on there. Not sure how you can do that easily.

Feedback: On my 24 inch monitor, the website content overflows horizontally (requiring me to scroll left-right). You can fix this by removing: .item-list { width: 110%; } or change the width to 100%

Not as bad ass as OP's but [this website sells QR code plaques too.](
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:35:26
Thanks for sharing. What would someone use this for? Can you give an example, or maybe a screencast?

Bitcoin = Money

This stuff scares me away from day trading bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:41:35
But... he has a load of bitcoins stashed away somewhere doesn't he?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:17:26
How does one "illegally" generate bitcoins?

It looks like a storm is coming.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:23:20
Every day that goes by, it feels like our money is safer in Bitcoin than in banks.

Getting tired of seeing the Winklevoss twins' interview on the bottom of every bitcoin related article on that site. lol

You don't lose until you sell.

Yeah, like downloading a multibit wallet and buying some bitcoins from localbitcoins.com. how difficult
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:49:00
Thank you! Will look into using it.

@_date: 2013-12-06 23:30:13
bitcoin.org has bitcoin-qt on top of the wallets list. This is a bad idea since most newbies consider it as THE resource on Bitcoin. Someone needs to change this.

I think everyone should read it. Bitcoin is one of those "highly improbable" events likely to have major impact, akin to the others he talks about. [Here he talks about some of his ideas](
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:03:54
it depends...
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:58:44
jeez.. I'm currently demo trading on their MT4 and was thinking of depositing 1BTC to trade with. So thanks for the warning and good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:10:54
wtf did I just watch
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:39:54
Yes and no.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:22:27
How about asking fiverr to accept bitcoin? It's not easy getting membership to grow on such sites - classic chicken and egg problem.

Coming from a Forex trading background, this sounds very familiar with small brokers. Bitcoin doesn't have the kind of liquidity afforded to the Forex market, so I guess one can expect things like this to happen (not that they should). But, as a general rule of thumb: always use stops on all of your trades and take profit regularly. Trade small amounts and target small, but regular profits. Don't shoot for the stars.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:46:21
Buy and sell in small increments. As it drops, buy small amounts to average down the overall cost. As it spikes, sell small increments to pocket some profit.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:06:10
This is HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:25:53
True. But the Bitcoin market never sleeps (doesn't close ;)
