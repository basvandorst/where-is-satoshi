SegWit should be a good indication of which services and wallets takes bitcoin seriously. It's up to us to use those services, or replace them if they don't want to keep up with the technology.

The argument that being "closer to the original whitepaper" narrative is just stupid and misses the point of what is going on and what it takes to make bitcoin useful for more use cases without compromising its promise as a censorship resistance currency and permissionless access and innovation.
Here is an example of this mindset
The conspiracy theory about one guy in one of the many investor groups investing in one of the many side projects to bitcoin happens to be associated with the Bilderberg meetings is just absurd and embarrassing.
If they are worried about mysterious, dangerous "strangers" investing in this space, how about questioning Jihan Wu?

@_date: 2018-01-29 14:07:24

He did mention LN though. Some people see conspiracy, but the truth is that Bitcoin was not designed to keep old money out, or to prevent big money from playing their games. If SegWit, LN &amp; Co. turns out to defeat censorship resistance, or self sovereignty, better solutions will have to prevail. 
Either way, there is no point in all the coins running for the same solution without really knowing the result. 
Personally I think 2x blocks would be fine, and I expect it to happen at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:14:00
I think the original idea was that mining were supposed to be decentralized, so node centralization wasn't considered possible. But now that mining has become centralized into a few pools, node centralization has become a problem because the nodes keeps the ledger, and the ledger has to be decentralized and distributed in order to stay immutable and censorship resistant. 
It gets kind of complicated, but I would say this is a problem. The ideal situation would be if mining became more decentralized again.

Bitcoin is where all the activity is happening. Science, new technologies (side chains, drive chains, lightning), development, institutional investments.
We have seen this before. The futures market, BCash, Coinbase, Roger&amp;Co and miners may all have been involved in this "attack". But it doesn't matter in the end. The reason they created BCash is because they realized _they don't control bitcoin_

There is another problem with high cost nodes, people won't be able to verify their own transactions. Self sovereignty and sound money are fundamental for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin will become a slow, inefficient and expensive system that someone will replace with a SQL database sooner or later. A SQL database is much more efficient than a distributed ledger, and it can handle thousands of transactions per second. 
Think about it. Bitcoin as we know it will be gone, and your wallet will say "Service no longer available" when you try to spend your coins.
Is that fine with you?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:45:42


Yes, if you want to move the coins to a paper wallet


No. forget that. Only when you want to sell or use it. No need to do that until then.
Also, I suggest you avoid sending your private key to any online wallet, use a locally installed wallet like Electrum or MyCelium and import the secret key there. Then you can send it normally to Coinbase or whatever.


Yes it does. You can swipe the secret key with a wallet app or something when you want to import it.
Some apps/wallets also allow you to import/swipe the shared key to create a watch only wallet. This allows you to send coins to the "paper" wallet without having the secret key stored on the phone/PC.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:09:22
What split?
The B2X split was called off.
If you use a paper wallet you will typically have coins on both chains after a split. It's not the paper wallet really, it's the fact that you have and control the private key yourself.

@_date: 2017-12-09 03:09:01

The major promises of Lightning is speed and low fees without sacrificing security and censorship resistance. Two of the biggest hurdles in order to make Bitcoin an efficient medium of exchange.
From a technical perspective it makes a lot of sense, we just have to create good user interfaces and services around it.

How is it not working?
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:56:22


Thinking about it, you could try to install the BCash version of Electrum, called Electron
And create a new wallet based on the same seed you have for Electrum. It could actually work, but I would try it on a different computer so you don't mess up with the Electrum key files.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:37:48
So there will be hubs...
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:45:11
That's true, maybe it was Goldman buying in
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:25:05
This is where you are wrong. The core community recognizes what it takes to not ruin the immutability and censorship resistance of the distributed ledger. Without that, bitcoin is pointless and can just be replaced with a SQL database doing a lot more transactions per second than a distributed ledger ever can. The BCash camp is going to learn that the hard way.
Of course, a lot of people are trying to get rich quick, but that doesn't mean bitcoin doesn't work. It grows in a boom and bust cycle.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:29:05
No, I mean activity.
There are some alt coins that add features that bitcoin doesn't have yet, like Monero for example. But when it comes to solving the scaling issues, Bitcoin related projects are miles ahead.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:29:11
lol, that happens every now and then, even though this post was actually about both
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:27:46
I can understand that. Personally I have no reason to expect any issues. I have no illicit intentions, and the requirement to register crypto-currency gains for taxation doesn't differentiate any coins in my country
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:23:52
Yes, you can send coins between wallets, either between Electrum wallets or between different wallets on different devices. Just remember that there is a fee associated with sending coins, and the fee required to have the transaction settled within an hour or so is quite high at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:21:24

Another thing to note here is that if we are talking about "the masses", we are talking about billions of people living in countries with either a non existant or completely dysfunctional monetary system. They generally don't need to understand "why" bitcoin. They already get it.
Among other things, bitcoin is also a disiplinary hedge against current and future abuse by the powers that be.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:39:40
Actually, I'm not sure. I don't think it has to be banks though
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:11:26
Their "solution" to scaling will centralize the network of nodes into just a few, expensive hubs. When that happens, the BCash ledger will no longer be immutable or censorship resistant, and without that, the whole technology is just a waste of time and resources that could better be replaced by a couple of data centers with SQL databases.
Another problem with centralizing the network into just a few high cost hubs is that self sovereignty will be ruined, regular users won't be able to verify the correctness of transactions them self. Those few hubs will become "gatekeepers" subject to attacks and crack down by authorities.
It may sound strange to some people that this is important, but these are fundamental building blocks of this technology, without them, bitcoin is just a slow, inefficient and expensive system that no longer provide what it once promised, self sovereignty and permissionless access and innovation.
The way I see it, there are two ways to make sure the ledger stays distributed:
1. Decentralize mining. Miners have an incentive to store a ledger and keep it in sync. With thousands of independent miners spread around the world, the ledger would stay safe. This would be in line with Satoshis original vision, unfortunately, mining is no longer decentralized the way it once was. For this to happen, we probably have to change to a ASIC resistant PoW algorithm.
2. Incentivise economic nodes to store and sync a ledger. This is hopefully what the Lightning network will do, introducing a lot of independent, economic nodes incentivised to keep a ledger through the collection of fees. Given that the Lightning network can achieve this, it would be a real scaling solution (massive scale) without sacrificing the most important aspects of bitcoin, as mentioned earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:12:20
If it does, it has failed in reducing fees and friction and should be discarded.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:03:37
No problem, I don't know how things will work out, but I'm betting on the core team so far
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:03:37
To keep the ledger safe, we have to spread it all over the world.
This can be done by making mining decentralized (change PoW algorithm)
or by incentivising economic nodes to store and sync a ledger (Lightning network)
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:36:49
I can confirm that the same thing is happening in other EU countries as well, some barrier were overcome today.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:03:49
BCash believes bigger blocks is the solution to scaling. This is based on the idea that miners is the backbone of bitcoin, which is wrong, the distributed ledger is also the backbone of bitcoin. If the ledger is no longer distributed (decentralized), the immutability and censorship resistance is gone and bitcoin makes no sense anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:24:18
Yup, I really enjoyed reading all the white papers, BIP's and source code from Ver. It took me about 0 seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:00:07
To use a mnemonic phrase I would generate it with a wallet that supports it, like Electrum.


You would have to import the private key on the paper wallet into a wallet that supports importing a raw key, or a wallet app that can swipe the picture.


You should download the website, disconnect your PC from the internet, open the downloaded page in a browser, generate the key and obliterate any trace of it on the PC before reconnecting again. Preferably also restart the PC before connecting again.

@_date: 2017-12-26 05:02:50
Bitcoin was never about shutting anyone out. Everyone with money can invest if they want to. The important part is that nobody controls it in a way that prevents self sovereignty, permissionless access and censorship resistance.
The conspiracy theories coming from Roger &amp; Co. are ridiculous and their only purpose is to be in control.
The fact that some investor behind Blockstream happens to be associated with the Bilderberg meetings doesn't prove or say anything. A coin that is completely controlled by a cartel of centralized miners from China is much worse.
If it turns out that Lightning doesn't provide the what we need without sacrificing self sovereignty and permissionless access, we will replace it with something better, but I don't see how that is the case right now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:27:51
Yes, that's one reason why the Lightning network is a much better way to scale and also keep the ledger distributed.

There may be some truth to this, but still, this dip was healthy and expected. The price has been pumped lately, and if Roger, Wright and others are leaving, we will be better off in the long run.
I also get the impression that the BCH guys are getting desperate because they know LN is about to happen.
Chances are Coinbase will be dwarfed by the first exchange that supports LN transactions. No wonder they invested in Blockstream recently.

We should have all of those. At some point Litecoin blocks will get full, and the blockchain will become huge. If we don't have a better solution at that point, we're in Barney.

He doesn't understand the equilibrium between the different parts of the system. Not surprisingly, Ver and hes supporters are those who make money from doing transactions alone.
Ver appears to be a salesman and has never contributed anything to code, BIPs or discussions. Neither has he ever participated in the forums relevant to development and science, like the mailinglist, IRC or github.com
He did invest early, and he has funded some projects, but the fact that he doesn't understand why keeping the ledger distributed is fundamental to bitcoin says everything I need to know.
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:47:14

If you want to start with a desktop wallet you could start by installing Electrum and create a wallet in there (You can have many)
Make sure you write down the seed words on paper, opt in to encrypt the wallet and write down the encryption password on the same paper as the seed.
Keep the paper secret and secure. The seed is all you need to restore your wallet on any PC/Phone at any time. The password is just there for convenience (People tend to forget their passwords)
Now that you have a wallet ready, you can try to buy some
If you buy some bitcoin on a online exchange and you want to move the coins to your personal wallet, send/withdraw the coins from the exchange to an address you get from the "receive" tab in Electrum.

You could say the same about the upper 21M limit, but changing any of them requires a hard fork, which essentially means that such a change requires consensus from the network peers.
In general they will all be against such a change because it inflates their coins. Even if you got say 70% consensus, you would still create a fork of the blockchain, and that fork is likely to be less valuable than the original, and most participants would just consider it another dividend.

Bitcoin and BCash has the same ability to scale. If BCash continues to increase the block size, they will achieve a bigger throughput than Bitcoin, but this is just a constant increase that has nothing to do with the ability to scale.
The ability to scale is typically measured using big O notation 
If BCash keeps increasing the block size it would be like kicking the can down the road, it's not even a naive form of scaling.
The problem I see with trying to "scale" this way is that running a full node in the network becomes more and more expensive, which means fewer and fewer will do it.
In the end, there may just be a few huge nodes left (exchanges and miners) and at that point, the ledger is no longer distributed throughout the world, but kept by a few big operations. These operations will be easily controlled by an authority, which might decide to demand an increase in the max number of coins, for example.
At this point, the ledger (blockchain) is no longer immutable or censorship resistant, which means that it has no purpose anymore. It will just be a slow, expensive and inefficient "database" that could better be replaced by a SQL database which has no electricity cost, no delay and can handle thousands of transactions per second.
You see the problem?
We need to make sure the ledger stays distributed and decentralized. The BCash guys keeps claiming that the miners are the backbone of Bitcoin and that they are the only ones that matters, while in fact this misses the point of crypto-currencies completely. The distributed ledger is just as important.
Note that this is just my personal opinion, BCash or some other coin may have a clever way to solve things that I don't see yet. Besides, the world is a complex place where the best solution doesn't always win.

Maybe not, but my initial comment in this thread was about the fact that miners don't decide what bitcoin is, the nodes does. All the hashing power in the world can't change the consensus rules used by the network of economic nodes.
That aside, it is sad that services like Coinbase and ShapeShift refuse to implement features like SegWit which actually _is_ a capacity increase.
Another mistake NYA did was to hire a thug to force a soft fork on everyone. If they had brought the community onboard instead, my guess is we would have had both SegWit and 2x blocks in the pipeline now.
Of course, there is also the POW change option, but at that point all bets are off anyway.

Well, B2X used a different code repository with different coders, administrators and procedures. Core didn't really have much other choice than to compete. If the B2X guys had stuck to the regular repository and BIP process, things may have turned out differently, but also taken them longer.
In addition to that, the core developers are more conservative in their approach to scaling and that has a price (literally).
Bitcoin already has plenty of cuts and bruises from having to move too fast through the first years of development. I may be wrong in the end, but I still think we have to pay that price to avoid becoming obsolete in the long run.

Then you didn't read it all. Block size increases are being discussed by core developers as well.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:09:45
Due to how mining is designed there is an equilibrium for the total amount of hashpower, so if some amount of hashpower leaves, the profitability goes up for the hashpower that stays. The halving of block rewards will play a role in this equation, but there will always be an equilibrium.
If LN works out as we expect, it will allow bitcoin to scale dramatically, so there is no reason to believe blocks will not be filled up again at some point.
It does move some of the profitability from miners to LN nodes though, which is actually a good thing in terms of keeping the ledger distributed.
If I were a miner, I would be looking into running some LN nodes as well right now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:51:59
I'm not saying you're wrong, but the flip side of that is that bigger blocks is not a scaling solution the way LN is. It merrily kicks the can down the road.
Also, one of Bitcoins weaker points is that full nodes are not incentivised properly. The hubs in a LN network could, given there are a lot of them and that they receive some fees, could remedy that problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:45:13

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:39:39
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:15:22
There is no way you can scale to visa level on-chain without reducing the distributed ledger into a few hubs of "Amazon" size. And when that happens this whole technology is ruined and can better be replaced with a good old SQL server that can handle thousands of transactions per second without wasting electricity and bandwidth.
If LN works out, it will strengthen the distributed ledger by motivating more people to run a full node, making sure the ledger stays immutable and censorship resistant.
Also, LN doesn't have to provide perfect security, it only have to provide enough security so that most people feel comfortable moving some amount onto the second layer for spending, and for exchanging with third parties that you normally would trust.
Scaling on-chain using bigger blocks will be a race to the bottom. If Bitcoin Cash doesn't go for huge blocks right away, someone else will fork it and do it for them, so on and so forth. At some point the distributed ledger is not so distributed anymore, immutability and censorship resistance will be gone, and someone will just go ahead and replace the ledger entirely with a SQL database. And they would be right in doing so.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:49:31
Jesus, this is embarrassing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:43:07
The other coins won't be useful either. Just look at how Google, Facebook and Amazon has handled scale over the years. They got hundreds of thousands of servers running in massive silos.
At that point, why not just use a battle tested SQL database and solve it the same way they did?
Distributed systems are the only solution that has the necessary resilience and censorship resistance we need, but scaling is going to be slow and painful.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:24:19

Just a personal opinion, not an advice.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:52:40
Well, that's not the whole truth. If 30% of the miners leave because the reward are too low, the reward increases for those who stay. There is an equilibrium for mining.

For a start, there is not one ledger, there is a copy of the same ledger stored at every network node.
The trick is to make sure all nodes end up with identical ledgers over time.
In essence, if you drop a transaction into the network, the nodes will propagate it to the miners, the miners will collect a bunch of transactions into a block, calculate a valid nonce for said block and send it back to the network for validation and storage in the ledger.
In this process, every block and transaction are validated using cryptographic signatures.
If I were to start a business today, I would look into how the Lightning Network works and how Rootstock works, and draw inspiration from that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:38:25

Well, if there is only a handful of huge nodes left in the network, it will be relatively easy for governments to collude and force those nodes to make changes to the rules, like censoring certain addresses, or even increase the max amount of coins.

It's really sad to see Roger Ver these days.

The big blockers will end up with a centralized system similar to what Google, Facebook and Amazon have built, and at that point you might as well replace the distributed ledger with a battle tested SQL server that can handle thousands of transactions per second. Censorship resistance will be gone anyway.

@_date: 2017-12-22 11:27:20
Increasing the block size will centralize the network of nodes, which means weakening the immutability and censorship resistance of the blockchain.
It is also a race to the bottom where BCash forks will compete on providing the biggest blocks, until eventually someone realizes that BCash nodes has become just a few Amazon size hubs and decides to replace the entire distributed ledger with a SQL database. No electricity cost, no delay and thousands of transactions per second. It makes perfect sense since immutability and censorship resistance are long gone anyway.

In my experience it's very hard to say about bitcoin, nothing is unlikely to happen when it comes to the price.
It's also important to remember that bitcoin as a technology is not about price but rather about self sovereignty and as an exit from a completely broken system.

Well, it's up to you really, but the reason to store coins on a paper wallet is usually that you want to avoid storing the secret key on any phone/computer in case it gets hacked. 
If you import the secret key on the paper wallet into your software wallet, that security guard is gone.

The honestly behaving (non-mining) nodes, have essentially forked themselves off "the network".
I would prefer to define "the network" to be a specific set of consensus rules. Sure, a majority of hashpower forking off can cause a lot of friction


Running SPV nodes may not work out after all


I would say that centralization of mining is the failure here, and something Satoshi didn't envisioned when he wrote the whitepaper


I would say nodes keeping the blockchain, relaying transactions/blocks, and validating the consensus rules are a very deliberate choice and a fundamental part of the security model.

No, they can't. As soon as they start buying, the price will sky-rocket. How long do you think they would keep paying an ever increasing price before thinking "Hmm, the price is now at $500k per coin because of our own buying spree, maybe we are fooling ourself here...". 
The tables would turn pretty quick, who's the elephant now?


I didn't say if, I said when. I have been right for 9 years straight.
The price is only volatile if you use $ as the unit of account. If you use Bitcoin as as a unit of account, it is 100% stable and 100% predictable.

No, it is a global, scarce, censorship resistant payment network, medium of exchange, store of value and potentially a unit of account. All in one. 
The fact that some people invested early and made a profit doesn't make it a Ponzi.
Bitcoin is also circulating through miners and economic nodes (Lightning) constantly as fees, and will continue to do so forever. A Ponzi doesn't work like that.
This is sound money, a Ponzi is not money.
Also, you have to look at how it is used in places like Venezuela, Greece, Africa and so on. Investors can make the price fluctuate, but that doesn't change how it works, and why different markets find it valuable.

Nobody knows that. If we think it will be, the bitcoin price of goods and services should go up.


This is pretty much what people describe as price discovery, the markets determine the true value of goods and services. If people doesn't want to spend x amount of bitcoin for a product, it's because the price is too high.
Just because this mechanic was undermined and destroyed by the Nixon shock doesn't mean we can't get it back. Gold was a great currency for people, Fiat never was. Fiat was designed to be useful only for the elite on the sunny side of the inflation rate, and that is just scratching the surface of how terrible Fiat is as a currency.
If we think about it, it is actually a great thing that bitcoin is useless for anything else than being money. It makes it much easier for everybody to agree that money is exactly what we are going to use it for. It means that it will always be available as payment for goods and services.

1 - Simply put, the majority of validating nodes in the network
2 - They don't. The algorithm is simple, and it will adjust over time depending on how fast it gets solved, always converging towards 10 minutes. More total hashing power will reduce this time window, and the algorithm gets "harder" to solve as a result. Loss of hashing power will increase the time window, and the algorithm gets easier to solve as a result.
The algorithm itself is simple, each block header has a counter in it, and the miners keep changing this counter until the SHA256 hashing algorithm generates a signature for it that starts with a certain number of zeros. Increasing the the difficulty becomes as simple increasing the required number of zeroes.
3 - The network consists of independent, validating nodes keeping a complete copy of the ledger (the blockchain). In essence, the majority of nodes decide what the rules are. In other words, if the developers makes a change, they depend on the majority of nodes to accept and upgrade to include this change. If some nodes decides to accept a change, and others doesn't, the network will effectively fork.
Considering the game theory involved, those with skin in the game has an incentive to not increase the max number of coins. This includes both investors and miners.
There are no leaders that can overrule any or each network node. The network is considered more healthy and successful the more decentralized and independent it is. The different development groups on the other hand are  typically hierarchical meritocracies, doing they best to provide the most popular solution.

No, it needs adoption for the price to become stable. As that happens it becomes a better store of value and a better unit of account. It is impossible to design something to be stable from the start without relying on third parties and worthless political decrees. 


Yes, it isn't. You can't compare the housing market to Bitcoin. If you do you don't understand what is going on here.


Look at the real statistics, not the price history and market caps. Those are useless. The relevant statistics at LocalBitcoins.com shows that adpotion is constantly growing all over the globe. The reason for this adoption is different for a poor country with hyper inflation and rich countries like EU/US where speculators dominate.


Wrong, 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin out of max 21 million. It always will be.
The reason paper money had to be pegged to gold is that gold was scarce but wasn't convenient as a medium of exchange. Paper money was a good medium of exchange, but not scarce.
Bitcoin combines these properties. A lot of people can't get their head around this fact, including Peter Schiff.

It's not that simple. I would say that having enough hash power is important. Any more than that doesn't really change anything, except increasing the difficulty. I'm not sure what the complications of that are, but it's probably not good for decentralization.
I would say Bitcoin is secure as long as it has many miners and nodes that are still reasonably decentralized.
It's also a "safe investment" as long as adoption and infrastructure is strong. This is probably where Bitcoin still dwarfs all the others.

@_date: 2017-08-25 15:48:54
That's not correct. There is a lot of threats in this space, and anyone can be bitten at any time. The whole space is also going to grow and improve going forward. Even if I agree that Blockstream has some interesting ideas for scaling and availability, core does not.
Core does have some interesting ideas around privacy and fungibility, unfortunately, until this is implemented and adopted, other coins does it better.
Also, from what I hear, Blockstream are building in-house technologies that provides privacy solutions for companies, or something like that. While they are free to do that, I'm not interested in that at all. Specially not if it is designed for big companies and banks only. What we need are decentralized, neutral technologies that are available to everyone and that are not encumbered with legalities and political regulations.

I don't want a "legit" currency, I want a currency, period.
As far as I am concerned there a re no decent alternatives, and if there were any, they would be volatile too.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:26:21
Well, personally I consider censorship resistance and fungibility the most important properties of cryptocurrencies, so anything that hampers those would be bad side effects.
Also, anything that makes scaling difficult, or the ability to upgrade the protocol in a safe manner would be bad side effects.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:47:58
It doesn't really matter if we are a cult or not. Crypto currency technology speaks for itself. They will never survive as what most people consider legitimate.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:13:27
SegWit seems to be easy to defend. Pretty much every developer agree that it fixes annoying issues and enables valuable opportunities without introducing dangerous side effects. Neither does it favor anyone over others, or prevent block size increases in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:43:18
We could go all the way back to 2009 when there were no scaling issues, tiny market cap and less than a dollar for a coin
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:33:42
It is not unrepresentative and biased to try to recognize the facts and identify the source of the problem. 
Considering Rusty's suggestions, the developers seems to be the only common denominator that can get us out of it.

You can buy small amounts. No one can predict the price
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:37:35
can you post the confirmation transaction here, so we can look it up?
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:22:11
Just ask them if the coins were sent, and if it was, ask them to give you the transaction ID.
When you have the transaction ID, you can look it up on  and find the receiver address.
If the receive address was a buy address from blockchain.info, maybe the blockchain.info support can move the coins from there to one of your receive addresses
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:17:02
The state of the blockchain when internet went down will continue to live forever, but internet is required for anyone to add new transactions on top of it.

@_date: 2017-08-03 23:59:03
This is a bad idea from a technical standpoint, even though it makes sense strategically. 
Let's wait and see what sidechains and L2 networks can do in terms of scaling.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:33:08


I wonder what he means by this. All code that goes into Bitcoin Core is copyright by the core developers, under the MIT license.
The DPL makes more sense for Blockstream's own technologies, like Lightning etc, but SegWit is _part_ of the core client, and as such should fall under the MIT license.
Anyone know how that works out?
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:29:46
Most of the world is unbanked, and the rest of it is stuck with a flawed economic system that is increasingly used to control the masses, benefit special interests and funding wars. We need a open, neutral, censorship resistant economy to bootstrap a truly free market.
This is not just kumbaya stuff, it affects everyone, all the time, in a negative way. In addition to that, as much as 50% of our savings are lost to inflation every 10 years, assuming you have any savings left after the excessive taxes we will see in the near future.

When you withdraw coins, you have to give them the address to withdraw to.
If I understand it correctly, you used a receive address from blockchain.info, which is correct.
It sounds like you just have to wait for a while.

Coins like XRP are typically tied to some US company, which in turn ties them to the US judicial system, and any regulation and gag orders that comes from it.
These coins are just toys. The rest of the world has every reason not to go down that path.

The reason gold was used as a currency is that it was scarce and the fact that it wasn't really useful for anything else. If it had been useful as food, or for paving roads, it would not have been chosen as a currency.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:08:11
People have varying opinions about this, a few problems with bigger blocks I can think of
1. The size of the blockchain increases
2. Network bandwidth requirement and latency increases, benefitting bigger miners over smaller ones and pushing more nodes off the network. Also making it harder to distribute blocks using long range, low bandwidth equipment
3. It is not a scaling solution, it merely kicks the can down the road
4. A lot of the blocks being produced right now is either completely empty or only partially filled. Given the size of the mempool, this is a serious malfunction that has to be fixed first.

In addition to that, Bitcoin will continue to exist even if mankind moves to 100% clean energy and reduces the overall consumption to 10% of what it is today, which indicates that they still haven't been able to identify and state the problem correctly.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:48:17
It's pretty much true, even though increasing the block size may be just as bad. It's all about controlling the software.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:51:34
Which blockchain is it, and how distributed is the hashing power that makes it censorship resistant?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:28:47
Maybe, but there is a risk of special interests getting too much influence over a project that depends on open and neutral processes.
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:15:55
I'm not worried. If BCH is better at delivering censorship resistance, it deserves its spot in the sun.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:07:44
I don't really care too much about the block size as long as it allows people to mine efficiently using general purpose infrastructure. It's not because I want to mine with my home PC, it is because increasing the size of the blocks will eventually lead to centralization and censorship, something we can not afford. Back in the days, the idea of forking the project and competing on the source code level was common, but we can't afford that now with real competition from other coins that are working on solving this exact problem.
Also, if I want my fuse box to buy the cheapest power every 2 minutes, or I want my refrigerator to order food automatically, or my browser to pay for content while browsing, on-chain scaling will never work. It just won't. In that context block size doesn't really matter anyway, other than being small enough to prevent mining to become centralized, and big enough to allow people to use it when transacting higher amounts.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:04:19
I'm afraid Schiff will be late to the party.
There is two reasons gold was considered useful as currency, scarcity and the fact that it is useless for anything else.
If gold were needed for other things, like building houses or as food, it would not have been used as a currency.

We don't know, but it isn't unlikely either :D
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:51:11
A huge amount of coins were bought by an inconsolable baby at a very early stage. We probably have to pay the price for that for quite some time going forward. In addition to that, the centralized mining has lead to a situation where a single person has the ability not only to attack the network using hashing power, but also by destroying the economy at it's infancy.
If those same people are able to succeed with what they are doing now, trust in the system will probably never be restored, no matter how much snake oil Ver are able to force down peoples throats.

No problem. 
Actually, if you dig into how validation works, there is something you could call _competing chains_ that can happen temporarily sometimes, but that is just an implementation detail so I assume that was not what you were thinking about.

That's not necessary if you just want to see the ballance. The private key is only used to sign transactions that sends your coins to someone else.
If you have the address you sent coins to, you should be able to create a watch only wallet based on that.

@_date: 2017-08-04 22:33:13
The main problem with BCH is that they are trying to steal the name. People are going to buy that thing thinking it is Bitcoin.
Also, the main reason behind all the problems is that the miners doesn't understand why bitcoin works.
Chasing adoption by increasing block size will not only drive nodes away from the network, it will also centralize mining itself, and with that comes censorship. I can not see how this can be solved other than to replace SHA256
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:42:39

No wallet should allow sending to invalid addresses. Which wallet did you use?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:51:02
The miners mine in order to get the block reward associated with every block, and the fees associated with each transaction in that block. The block reward decreases according to some formula, so around year 2120 the fees is the only reward they get for finding a valid block.
Validating blocks is done by both miners and full nodes, but it is only the full nodes that maintain a copy of the blockchain.

Meritocratic isn't really the right word for open processes like that, but I guess we use it anyway in lack of more descriptive names.
The traditional interpretation of a meritocracy talks about educational screening or other kinds of tests, something you don't find in open source projects. It's basically replaced by collective independent review of each contribution.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:19:17
I didn't mean to dispute your point, only this part from the post you linked to


The miners doesn't do that, they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes.
The idea that the miners add blocks to the blockchain is quite common, but wrong. Strictly speaking, the miners just do one thing, calculate hashes, they don't have time for _anything_ else.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:36:19
No, there is no talk of that. I don't think we will see that in a long time.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:52:01
1. yes, even though software wallets can be used in a way that is just as secure as hardware wallets. Typically requires 2 computers, where one is offline. Software wallets like Electrum can also give you a seed, which is really just as good as a paper wallet. The key is to generate the wallet/seed in a safe way
2. Mycelium, Electrum, Coinomi, Jaxx. Tha last two has support for other coins I believe.
3. Looks like an easy way to get some coins, but I'm not familiar with those products.
3. Basically yes, but selling for fiat money requires you to have an account on some exchange. You typically send the coins to that account in order to sell it.

In that case, it's either over, of full war. It is as says, this technology doesn't exist without all the underlying fundamental constructions in place, and they specifically prevent censorship and control by any single party. That's the whole point. Without that, it is just an inefficient, pointless waste of resources, which is better replaced by traditional databases, which is also what banks already have been using for decades.

It depends on how you see it. If you payed $5 for those coins, its also the cheapest games you ever bought.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:59:49
Your transaction gets included in the next block, and that block is added on top of the blockchain. Not sure I understand the question...
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:34:25
It can take time before the transaction is confirmed, so the blockchain wallet may not show the final balance yet.
If you have the address you sent coins to, you should paste it into  and see if there is a transaction waiting.
If not, there is something wrong, and you should talk to BTC direct support.
Also, the receive page on blockchain.info will probably generate a new receive address every time you enter the page, so you can't get it from there, but maybe there is a transactions page you can check

I completely agree. I have heard Samson Mow of Blockstream talk about focusing on privacy next, and I know Greg Maxwell has been working on this for years. Some of hes papers have already been implemented by other coins.
Without fungibility, hence privacy, I don't see Bitcoin dominate the future of cryptocurrencies.

They depend on that in order to extract taxes and duties so they can redistribute wealth the way they see fit and to keep the planned economy alive.
Bitcoin flies in the face of anyone who wants to keep the population hostage as sheep and livestock, and that includes elitist systems like socialism and communism.

I believe Marxist is the new slogan for everyone that blindly follow along the path provided to them, not realizing that there is a global elite leading them on that doesn't care squat about freedom, human rights, democracy, free markets, capitalism, socialism, communism or whatever it may be. They are into large scale brainwashing across continents and will happily apply any of them to steer the herd.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:41:52
I think everyone knows who that is. We are talking about 8-10 guys who all run some kind of business that could benefit from bigger blocks in the short run.
It's all about taking control of the software. Their problem is that they have no idea what it takes to not ruin this technology, how to create it, or how hard it is to create it while it is already in use. All they want is a quick fix for their bottom lines. All the accusations about original visions and Reddit censorship is complete nonsense.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:18:00

That's because I never said anyone had. I'm talking about _all_ the challenges and threats ahead, not the scaling problem in particular.
Some people think high fees are good, and some people think high fees are bad. Personally I think fees, and the scaling issue, is much lower on the priority list than censorship resistance and fungibility. Those are the ones that are going to be hard to achieve and preserve.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:09:35

About when the WannaCry virus showed up, a couple of months ago, some guy at work came to me with some questions about buying bitcoin. The cool thing about it was that he didn't want to get rich quick or anything like that, he wanted to hold some just in case fiat hits the fan again. So yeah, a lot of people "gets it", and I believe this thing will be able to sell itself for the right reasons.

I can certainly see some benefits of that BIP. Both as a strategical move, and the fact that it scales with infrastructure and not adoption.

Jesus, this drivel will never end.
For God's sake, stop listening to Ver, he is the reincarnation of a snake oil salesman.
Until proven otherwise, bitcoin is a open source project, managed according to rules. If that should change, the code will be forked and we will all move over.
Discussions that actually matter take place on the Linux mailing list, IRC channels and Github issues.
Some developers are payed by companies that have interests in the project, and some are not. If the miners want to be heard, they will have to hire some real developers and make them work _with_ the rest of the dev community, not against them.
For those that haven't noticed, a core developer just proposed a BIP that increases the block size over time, based on expected increase in network throughput.
We don't write this software just to fill the pockets of some miner. Never did, never will.

It is true that Bitcoin was created to remove the control of money, and thereby freedom, from the hands of governments and institutions.
They have abused those powers in the worst possible way for way too long. Bitcoin was not created to manipulate or achieve unrelated goals, whether it be substituting the cold war, or fighting terrorism.
Never the less, I'm sic and tired of all the bashing around here. The truth is that we have no idea how anything is going to play out. From here on out I'm going to encourage everyone to do whatever they find necessary to preserve censorship resistance. I no longer care about block sizes, time frames, overblown egos, terrorists, starving African kids or anything else.

You could try Zebpay  
Personally I would install the Electrum wallet and transfer the coin from the exchange to the wallet.
The wallet is free. Just make sure you write down the seed it gives you when you create a new account, and keep it secret. As long as you have the seed, you can restore your account on any computer/phone.

Imagine a dice. It has 6 possible outcomes, in other words, there is only 6 coins total. If anyone tries to change the dice, or claim a number that has already been used, or whatever, the network of nodes, which all imposes the same set of rules, will recognize the cheat and just reject it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:53:53


Scale happened. Unfortunately there is no easy solution to that, bigger blocks scales linearly at best, up to a point where it flips and starts physically slowing down the traffic and causing all kinds of mysterious lag and latency.
If the second layer solutions doesn't ruin censorship resistance, that's your scaling solution right there. In addition to speed, it should also lower the fees, increase the number of network nodes and even provide some income for node operators.
At least, until proven otherwise, that's what we are hoping for.

Today, miners get a block reward in addition to the fees associated with each transaction in the block.
The block reward goes down in steps and disappears around 2115 or so, but the fees are still there. Also remember that as adoption increases, so does the fees.
The end game is a decentralized, self sustained economy driven by fees.

On one side you have the core team who has developed bitcoin since the beginning.
On the other side, you have one guy who used to work on bitcoin but suddenly took a 180 degree turn in what he consider bitcoins future to be, and for some reason still insist on working on the same technology.
If it were the core team that suggested a block increase, I doubt anyone here would object much to it

I'm not saying forks are unheard of, I'm saying that the SegWit2x fork could have been dealt with in the usual way, and provided as a patch. The stubborn and narsicisstic approach we have ended up with now could easily cause harm to everyone.
I'm not familiar with any earlier, internal conflicts, but it seems to me that core has provided reasons for why they want to be careful about increasing the block size too fast, while 2x hasn't really given any rational reasoning, they are just running around making up conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:26:57
BCH supporters are actually just stupid and easily fooled. The miners behind these attacks say they want to continue Satoshis vision, which is obviously BS since they didn't show up until 2014. 
The truth is actually quite simple, they want to control the consensus rules of the software so they can make sure every change goes in favor of the miners. That's why they keep trying to fork the software, completely not interested in "working things out" with the current developers. 
Just look at the proponents of bigger blocks, they are all either involved in mining, or are planning to start a mining operation, and it's not that many of them either.

As already said, the seed is all you need. Making backups of the wallet.dat file isn't the best idea, in fact, I would make 2 copies of the seed and store them at different locations. I would also encrypt the wallet file stored on disk (can be done in the gui menu), and write down the encryption password on the same paper as the seed.
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:02:38
Well, every full node on the network keeps a copy of the blockchain on disk. If I had a node, and internet went down, it would be as if I turned my computer off for a day. As soon as it is online again it will start "talking" to other nodes on the network and start syncing with the others.
Private keys, which is used to move your coins, is also stored locally on disk so nothing would get lost.
Basically, internet is required to move forward, but it is not required to preserve the current state.

Yeah, it's hard to say, in a way the structure is flat by default, but a dynamic hierarchy of trust seems to play a part as well. One nice property is that it is up to you how you influence the project, and your work is treated by it's own merit.

Don't underestimate that beast. Specially not when mixed with all kinds of spin doctors and social engineering going on.


As I understand it, the core developers haven't decided on this, other than doing the SegWit increase first, which we now have. The block size debacle started after that decision because someone considered some agreement to be broken.

Last I heard, he is planning on starting a mining operation himself. Same with Craig Wright. No wonder they want to see big, juicy blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:41:39
Every full node holds a copy of the blockchain, so having many nodes spread around the world helps to secure the integrity and immutability of the blockchain. 
It also helps in propagating transactions and blocks in a resilient manner. If, for example, there were only 100 nodes in the network, and most of them were located in Bangladesh, that would give Bangladeshian miners an advantage in terms of network latency.
Without further analysis, that's how I see it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:51:24


I believe that can be done without SegWit, but SW makes it more secure.


I was thinking about upgrading to stronger cryptography and things like that. If those things can be done with a soft fork, that would be great. But, there is other things like some of the protocol rules and the coin cap that should require a hard fork. As far as I know, SegWit doesn't change anything there.


The way I see it, companies will create closed solutions around the blockchain no matter what. In fact, most transactions today are already done off chain by closed systems developed by Coinbase.
The most important thing for me is that the open source project is neutral and independent from any company or special interests. So far, this seems to be the case, and Blockstreams technologies are optional, and separated from Bitcoin itself. If this changes, we _do_ have a problem.
Also, the fact that people can swap coins between blockchains without a third party involved is a good thing isn't it?

Actually, I believe people put different things into it, but in general, it seems related to issues like the dismantling of democracy and traditions, the idea that everyone is a result of their environment including gender, the war on identity, the idea that everyone is equal and that we should force equality on everyone down to the last detail, so on and so forth.
These ideas are indoctrinated like never before, in politics, education and through company policies and across populations.
I believe the reason behind a lot of the anger and dissent lately is because people don't like to be told what to think, or who they are, or to give up their rights and beliefs to some greater ideal based on false premises put forth by what appears to be an elite of idiots, narcissists and psychopaths.
A lot of people will follow along like sheep being told what to believe, but there will always be many that knows better and refuses to do that. The patronizing aspect of it, and the fact that people are being forced into this mindset against their will is causing a lot of problems. At the same time, the sheep that unknowingly follow along are being filled with fear and disbelief, which is exactly what the masters wants in order to achieve the above.

The word "money" is a bit misleading of course, since the currency itself is useless, it is what you can exchange it into that matters.
It is when you receive that icecream that you see the whole picture. That's when you learn the _value_ of your labor, and how you can convert it into something you need or want.

Either that, or it will go through eventually. The fee is probably lower than the other transactions waiting in the mempool so it takes a long time. There is a way to push it though if need be, by basically spending it again with a higher fee, or something like that

Basically you want to withdraw the coins from Blockchain to an address you get from the receive tab in Electrum.
But before you do that, make sure you have written down the seed that Electrum gives you, and make sure you use a password to encrypt the Electrum wallet, and for convenience make sure you write the password down on the same paper as the seed.
You also have to make sure that paper is stored safely and that nobody else ever finds it. You may also consider making a copy of it and store that copy in a second location in case one of the copies are destroyed by fire, water or whatever.

As a software engineer, SegWit seems like something you absolutely want to get done before announcing version 1.0
It's a good thing when the right set of rules gets "set in stone", but the problem, and the difference from gold, is that bitcoin has competition. It really need to be optimally designed before the freeze happens. If not, it is much more likely to be superseded.
@_date: 2017-04-12 23:30:45
I didn't say quantity of nodes, I said quantity of transactions.
I thought the UASF signal was part of the agent string in each transaction.
Isn't that how web sites can count and keep track of the current UASF status, by scanning the blockchain (the only "central" point of information)?
@_date: 2017-04-20 05:34:13

Well, people were always warned about not investing more than they can afford to loose. There was a reason for that, and there is a reason the software version starts with a zero.

I mean, it says a lot that UASF is our last change to evolve at this point, thanks to people who have no clue what the real challenges are with technology and software development.
@_date: 2017-04-22 10:00:41


Not sure if it generates the transaction, but it generates the part that requires access to the private key.


No. And neither is the seed, or any key presses that could compromise your private key.
In essence, with something like a Trezor, you can spend coins safely on any random PC infested with malware and key loggers.
It's worth noting that if you install the Trezor software, their website provides you with a online wallet that does not compromise your keys, so you can have both security and convenience.

I have been looking at some discussions with Roger Ver lately and he's arguments seems to rest on two issues:
    1. The one who holds the most coins and does the most transactions should get to decide. Even technical decisions.
    2. censored him
The first issue is absurd and the second has nothing to do with anything. Even I have been censored by recently.
But, what puzzles me even more when listening to Ver is, why should he get to decide any more than me, or anyone else?

There is probably many ways to describe this.
A Turing complete script language has richer and more powerful control flows, including loops that can potentially run forever.
By "rich statefulness", he means a script language without complex features like loops.

If Bitcoin depends on paper futures to be stopped by force, this game is over.

Bitcoin shows how people can simply replace a broken system. Any communist regime is going to be run and inherited by incompetent fools. 
China is a good example, as a communist regime it was completely broke and had no incentive to innovate at all, until it decided to take advantage of and abuse the western capitalist system using what is practically slavery as a leverage. They have attracted investors, yes, but that is not going to last as their living standard continues to rise.
There is a certain type of people that think they have to "be in charge", and they are never suited for exactly that.
Democracy is about checks and balances, and the US is the only nation with a constitution that properly reflects that.

Your transaction gets confirmed when it gets included in a block that is accepted by the network as the next block in the chain.

Don't forget that the private key in that wallet.dat file also gives you access to the same amount of Bitcoin Cash.
You should do some research on that before doing anything though, so you don't end up overwriting your keys, or sending Bitcoins to a Bitcoin Cash address etc.

BCash keeps talking about the original intention of Satoshi and how that is supposed to be "quality".
Guess what, the white paper as well as the original version of bitcoin didn't differentiate between miners and users, _and_ the client software had a built in miner so that anyone who wants can join the mining effort. Satoshi changed hes mind along the way, just as he did about implementing a market right into the client itself.
Determining quality based on how old something is doesn't hold water. There is no reason to believe Satoshi would disagree with the latest improvements.
It's time to call the real reason why the miners created a fork of the protocol, they are worried about not being in control of the hashing algorithm.

The wallet.dat file was created by the bitcoin-core wallet
You could install that and replace the auto generated wallet.dat file with the one you have.
Since bitcoin-core is a full node, it will download the entire blockchain (130GB) which takes quite some time.
Alternatively, you could extract the private keys from that file and load it into Electrum:
To do this, you would have to install both bitcoin-core and Electrum, but you don't have to wait for bitcoin-core to download the blockchain, saving you some time
By the way, the wallet.dat file is not a backup type of file, it is the actual wallet file for bitcoin-core, containing the private key
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:19:41
You mean like this?
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:22:26
Well, I would at least make a complete image of the disk anyway
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:04:34
It's the reference client, bitcoin-qt
It will take a couple of days for it to download the blockchain, and you will need about 130GB of free disk space.
Once the blockchain has been downloaded, close the client, find the wallet.dat file (same location), and replace it with the old one.
Keep a copy of the wallet.dat file in a safe place, in case you mess things up while copying. Also keep it from being found/stolen.
Btw, if the wallet.dat file was encrypted with Truecrypt, you may be able to decrypt only that file, assuming you remember the password.
Good luck :)

This fork is designed as an attack trying to change the consensus rules and kill the current chain at the same time. This probably has to do with the fact that some people think the name of the project is the important thing, and to a snake oil salesman it probably is.

@_date: 2017-10-28 01:25:00
Well, the bitcoin blockchain is a sequence of blocks containing transactions, and each transaction in a block transfer coins on to the next owner (address).
Basically, for a transaction to be accepted by the network and included in a block, it has to be cryptographically signed using the private key that corresponds to the address that sends the coins. So in other words, you need the private key in order to send your coins to someone else.
Once the transaction has been included in a block by a miner, and that block has been accepted and added to the blockchain on all the nodes in the network, the coins has been effectively moved to the new owner.
That's just a simple explanation though, you can read more about the details in the Bitcoin whitepaper, or you can check out some videos like this series
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:46:19
First of all, I'm not saying the current block size is the optimal one. That's really not my point here either.
Second, if you are right about what you are saying, there is no way they will be able to compete in the long run. But as of right now people seem to stick with their roadmap, whether we like it or not.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:19:58


That's what the miners, and now also some exchanges wants you to believe.
They are deliberately misunderstanding one of the chapters in the whitepaper which talks about how network nodes behave when there are more than one competing block propagating through the network at the same time.
They are of course free to deliberately misunderstand this concept, which basically means that Bitcoin Cash has been Bitcoin a couple of times already, and that coins like Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin could possibly be called Bitcoin every now and then in the years to come.

It also goes on to say:
    The following general advices may apply:

        Use other cryptographic algorithm (e.g., ECC) instead of RSA on affected devices.
And the QA section:
    Q: Is the RSA algorithm insecure in general after the disclosure of this vulnerability?
    A: No. If the RSA primes are generated as a truly random numbers, our method cannot be applied. For example, keys generated by the OpenSSL library are NOT affected.
It seems that OpenSSL is not affected, which makes you wonder if this vulnerability is worth all that commotion

The LN network provides an efficient way to transact small amounts cheaply without affecting the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network. As long as there is an economic incentive to run a LN node, this is really huge. If we had stayed with miners only, we would have hit the wall eventually, and centralization would have killed this tech sooner or later.
This is much better for everyone.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:06:55
Okay, so they have said that _during_ the fork (is there such a thing?) it will be B2X, and at some arbitrary point in time after the fork, they may or may not swap the names of the coins?
What if the miners start moving back and forth between the chains as they did with BCash?
And what happened to the NYA agreement that there should be no fork?
At this point I think the best solution would be for the two camps to come together and create a new, premined, unbuyable and useless coin and donate the name Bitcoin to it. If the wallets, exchanges and media would splash those news for a couple of weeks we may end up in a situation of pure, fair competition again.

Byrne is legit, but I'm a bit disappointed actually. He keeps talking about the blockchain as the revolutionary technology of bitcoin.
Cryptocurrencies exist as an equilibrium of the network of nodes, the cryptography and the ledger (blockchain)
The blockchain in itself is not new or revolutionary in any way. It's just a plain old level DB. It could have been any key-value store, or even plain files.
The magic happens when this ledger is replicated and synchronized throughout the entire network, and kept consistent by a combination of consensus rules (network nodes), transaction ordering (miners) and the ability to add to the ledger protected by cryptography.
There is no _single part_ of this equation that makes any sense by itself.
Without the incentive for the miners to keep minting/collecting coins, and the ability of the network nodes to prevent consensus changes like an increase in the total number of coins, it all falls apart.

People are not trying to avoid 2x. They are choosing wallets that allow them to take control of their private keys, so that they end up with both coins if a fork happens.

@_date: 2017-10-25 14:49:15
You don't _have_ to use a hardware wallet like ledger. You can also use a software wallet like Electrum. If you do that, I strongly suggest you say yes to encrypt the wallet file on disk, and write that password down on the same paper as the seed :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:14:07


Oh I forgot that part, but yes, you can do that with Electrum. Just install it on a PC and take that PC offline for good. You can then generate your keys there.
Then you can copy the master public key over to a online PC that also has Electrum installed, and create "watch only" wallets. That way you can both watch and receive coins on the online PC, but if you want to spend coins you have to sign the transaction on the offline PC and copy that transaction over to the online PC to broadcast it.
This is not as convenient as a hardware wallet of course, but it is possible, and a lot of people did it this way before hardware wallets existed.

The consensus rules. A government spinning up thousands of nodes is not a problem as long as they fork the blockchain as soon as they try to change the consensus rules in those nodes.

@_date: 2017-10-25 13:32:24
Nakamoto never said anything about altcoins (different consensus rules) in the whitepaper, obviously.
What he described was how to _avoid_ a fork when more than one valid block were propagating through the network at the same time.
The work is not a barometer, but the market cap could be considered one. This is kind of obvious. If NSA decided to dedicate the entire Bluffdale facility to mine a Bitcoin fork, would we _have to_ call that fork bitcoin, even if nobody were using it for real life transactions?

I have no reason to believe this.

You want a hardware wallet, but you don't need it.
You can use Electrum pretty safely if you opt in to encrypt the wallet file stored on your disk and write down the password on the same paper as the seed.
A key logger could catch that password so I would avoid using operating systems like Windows and Mac. Hardware wallets on the other hand protect against this so in that case the OS doesn't matter.

If I understand your question, no. It is possible to do both and still end up with a single unified network, if care be taken.
However, bigger blocks is a non-compatible change so it requires a hard fork, and a hard fork is by nature a persistent network split.
Enabling off-chain scaling using SegWit only requires a soft fork which is not a persistent network split but a temporary one. As long as the temporary split exists, people are advised to avoid doing transactions.
Also, doing a soft fork is considered safer and less intrusive than doing a hard fork, obviously.

No, the miners get the fees. I think one confirmation means that there has been mined one valid block on top of the block containing your transaction. With two confirmations there has been mined two valid blocks after the block containing your transaction, and so on. 
This is important because there is a "competition" going on in the network where the longest chain of valid blocks eventually wins. Transactions in the chains that didn't win the race is left in the mempool so they can be included in a block for the next race.
Typically, mining software favors transactions with more fees in them, which is why those transactions tend to be confirmed sooner.
Validation and confirmation is done by all full nodes in the network, so eventually your transaction will have as many confirmations as there are full nodes in the network.

Bitcoin wouldn't exists if it wasn't for the core devs. Neither would any other crypto coin. As long as they continue to make the best possible decisions for humanity as a whole, we depend on them. If they don't, we have other options.

If bigger blocks is needed the core team will do the HF but right now SegWit is the next step.
Also, considering SegWit has several positive features, and no negative ones, why did the miners want bigger blocks as a compensation for it?

Neither does he recognize that he, or the miners he is hanging out with, has never contributed anything to the project.

He's a whelp.

I think those of us who has been around since the beginning knew something like this had to happen. Hell, we didn't even expect to get out of the dark without a fight. 
Increasing the block size will probably do 2 things, give the miners more fees and Ver more room to scale up hes pump and dump operation.
We need UASF for stuff like this, and we should make it as easy as possible for people to use it
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:53:22
If we are doing a HF, isn't there a lot more we want to add, including a new hashing algorithm?
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:46:18
We are fans of SegWit, but thanks to people like Ver and Jihan, UASF is the only way to get it any time soon. Nobody wants the network split and uncertainty UASF comes with, but it seems to be the only option.
But, the real disagreement is between those who wants to double the block size again and again until it reaches hundreds of GB, and those who want to avoid that.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:06:23
If you ask me, losing the core developers is more risky for bitcoin than forcing a HF tomorrow morning.
They _do_know best, and they have never been arrogant about it in any way.
Try saying that about the centralized miners who just wants more fees, and are willing to force a HF on us to get it. If it were up to them, they would make them self the kings of bitcoin, and they would expect you to bow your head in awe

Decentralized development doesn't work that well. The fact that the most competent collection of developers get some funding is as expected.

You can create different types of wallets with Electrum. The default type will store the keys in a file on your disk. If the disk is on a computer that is connected to the internet, it is not cold storage. If it is on a PC that is not connected, and has never been connected to the internet, it is considered cold storage.
It is possible to generate transactions on the online PC, sign it on the offline PC, and copy it back to the online PC and spend it there, given that you have Electrum installed on both. That way your private key never leaves the offline PC.
Hardware wallets like Trezor does something similar, but makes it much more user friendly. Electrum also allows you to create wallets where the key resides on a Trezor, which is probably what you want. I'm not sure if you can call it cold storage since the private key on your Trezor is connected to a online PC through a USB cable. But the important part is that the key never leaves the Trezor, so it's the best compromise you will get of both security and user friendliness.

SegWit is needed to enable layer 2 networks, so to speak. It is not a layer 2 network it self.
Also, people should be aware that centralization is even more likely to happen if we keep increasing the block size, but in this case it is mining and the verification process that gets centralized.

No we don't. If you gather all the developers in one big pile of meat, you could say that development were centralized in that place at that particular point in time.
However, once the meat starts moving around, it is no longer centralized.
More importantly, the development model is the closest model we have for representing a meritocracy, which by nature is decentralized.

@_date: 2017-05-22 18:33:07
The real problem here is not MASF or UASF, but the agreement it self. 
Even if we would like this thing to move on, and even if we go along with this agreement, we have to appreciate the fact that mining has become too centralized. Because of that, the community should continue signalling using UASF, miners should continue signalling using MASF, and we should all seriously consider what should go into any future HF.

The block size will be raised if and when necessary. It is risky and it has unwanted side effects, so why not start with the better options like SegWit. SegWit also increases the number of transactions per block, so its a win-win situation for everyone. In fact, doing anything other than that at this point is just a bad idea.

I'm not saying blocks can not increase above 1MB. As bandwidth increases, and 24/7 broadband becomes available to more people, a block increase could make perfect sense. It does give a block propagation advantage to bigger miners though, and that effect has no equilibrium, making unlimited block size a really bad idea.
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:29:41
Some of the propaganda statements coming from Jihan and others at are actually quite ludacris. The truth is that it is the nodes that enforce the consensus rules and provide security for the blockchain. The only security provided by miners are protection against double spending. 
It is also a fact that all the money that the miners collect are payed by the users in terms of fees, and the users also provide the traffic needed for the miners to generate new coins. It's not like they are creating the coins out of thin air.
If could just get these simple facts correct, maybe the attitude would have been different around here.

I think the easiest way to do it is to install electrum, create an account (make sure you type down the seed words and keep them secret), and transfer them to that account.
As long as you have the seed you can always regenerate your account on any computer.
For even better security I would use Linux and acquire a hardware wallet like Trezor. Electrum also has support for those.

Is there anyone doing massive amounts of hard work in this space without getting payed one way or another?
That said, no, I don't want bigger blocks if those blocks are going to be filled with transactions coming from speculators and pump &amp; dump tricksters. If we want bitcoin to facilitate that kind of trading, we should use Layer 2 networks for that. Trying to solve it by keep increasing the size of blocks isn't going to work out the way you think.

If I were to find a juicy address, I would just do a search there, rather than finding your store etc.

We don't want bitcoin to become another playground for crony capitalism.

If someone wants to put a shitload of eggs in one basket, that's fine, but it doesn't make them the rulers. Besides, we are all putting millions into bitcoin.

In software engineering, problem solving is an art. We shouldn't do risky hard forks just to "be fair" to a small group of miners, or investors.

@_date: 2017-07-12 15:07:20
If a miner starts to generate blocks that the nodes doesn't find valid, those blocks will not end up in the blockchain (of which a copy is stored on every node). They will simply be rejected, and they will not even be propagated to other nodes for consideration.
If the same miner creates a fork of the node software that consider he's blocks valid, that node software will of course accept hes blocks and store them in it's blockchain. At that point, this duo has effectively created an altcoin, and that miner will also get payed in that altcoin.
Proof of work is really just a way to guarantee that finding a certain answer to a riddle took a certain time. In bitcoin, this is used to achieve several goals: make it expensive to spam the network, make issuance of new coins into a competitive lottery and to determine the final order of transactions (important to prevent double spending)
Both nodes, miners and the cryptography are crucial parts of the security model. The reason I support the core team is that they understand this, and they will not do anything that ruins this balance.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:40:27

@_date: 2017-07-07 22:11:18


I didn't say that. I said that the full nodes decide the rules, not hashing rate.


Nobody said bitcoin can not be attacked given enough resources. 
Has it occurred to you that this kind of attack only makes a POW change more reasonable?
Has it occurred to you that this kind of attack can also be taken advantage of by centralized authorities?
Has it occurred to you that the more miners there are, and the more wide spread they are, the safer our coins are from adversaries like that?


Morals can never replace incentives in a truly free and open market. It has been tried so many times before and it never works. That is not what we are trying to build here.


Miners mine for profit, nothing else. And that is how it have to be for bitcoin to stay neutral. Stop trying to give miners Christmas presents, they are already the ones making the money. Even most miners agree that nodes should have been compensated in some way, just to keep the count and incentives up, which _is_ important.


I could agree to that, but neutrality and decentralization are crucial, which is why those things I have said matters. In many ways this debate over block size was always unnecessary and leads to unprofessional behavior from both sides, which is dangerous. We all want the same thing, so lets not ruin it.

You're right, Satoshi had that vision, but at that point he didn't consider what happens when a single miner has accumulated enough hashing power to become a threat to the censorship resistance, or a threat to the open review and development process.
I consider the white paper a description of the concepts. Implementing them in a hostile environment with lots of technical limitations and weaknesses was not Satoshi's strong side.
What I'm saying is that mining in itself is a very simple process. It takes transactions as input, and produces blocks as output. Without receiving transactions from economic nodes, miners has no input to work with. And without economic nodes accepting their output blocks, they are not building on the accepted blockchain.

The wallet doesn't store any transactions, only private keys and addresses.
Transactions are stored in the blockchain which is stored and kept in sync on all full nodes in the network.
1. I have no idea
2. Not necessarily. You can generate as many keys and addresses you want without actually use any of them to send or receive coins. I believe the core client will generate new addresses when you receive coins, so that will probably increase the size of the file. Sending coins doesn't generate addresses, so shouldn't increase the size of the file.

The address is not secret. People use it to send coins to you. 
The corresponding private key on the other hand is secret. This is only used when you generate a transaction that sends coins to someone else's address.
If you generated a private key and a corresponding address on a online web server, I wouldn't trust it. You should generate a new wallet locally using a wallet application, like Electrum.
Also, it is possible to generate a sequence of addresses from a single private key. This is what wallet software often do. Basically, all the addresses are derived from that private key using some deterministic mathematical algorithm.
Also, a seed is a more readable representation of the private key. A deterministic mathematical algorithm are used to convert between seeds and private keys. As long as you have your seed, you can always use it to regenerate your private key using wallet software

Not exactly. The consortium have made a fork of the code repository and called it "btc1"
If nobody runs this fork, nothing happens and SegWit gets activated.
If everyone runs this fork, SegWit2X will get locked in at some point.
If some runs this fork, and others runs the core client, some kind of blockchain fork will happen, I think.
Either way, the person who has write access is different on each of these source repositories.
This may or may not turn out to become a problem.
It's important that people can make a fork of the source code, but there should be a good reason for it, considering the fact that the development model used so far is open and meritocratic. People are worried that the consortium are trying to replace the existing reference client, rather than just forking it into a new coin, or creating a merge request for it, which would be the professional way to do this, and in accordance with the meritocratic development model.

I'm sic and tired of one-liners claiming that nodes doesn't help, and that only miners does.
It shows a complete lack of understanding of the security model.
The nodes validates both transactions and blocks, hence enforces the rules. They are also the ones securing the blockchain itself, by replicating it and spreading it out in large numbers. This is what makes it immutable and unreachable for adversaries able to run thousands of nodes, or able to manipulate operators by law. The more nodes we have, the better.
Strictly speaking the miners doesn't do that much for security. As long as there is many independent miners spread throughout the network, we should be reasonably safe against 51% attacks. That's about it.
edit: I should add that the proof of work done by the miners helps to prevent double spending, something that is also part of the security model.

2MB block size increase is a linear improvement. Its literally just kicking the can down the road. You might as well argue for 10MB, or 500MB. It's still just a linear increase.
The devs has spent a huge amount of work to find a solution that can actually scale exponentially, and that doesn't require a hard fork. Just apply it already.
If a HF turns out to be necessary later on, there is no reason to believe it won't be done.

1. 
2. If someone has a corrupt blockchain, that person will consider the transaction invalid and stop propagating it to others. This is not a problem though because everyone else will consider the transaction valid, and the majority is always right, basically.
3. I believe it is possible to add smart contracts to bitcoin using side chains. See Rootstock. Also, multisig can be used to introduce a trusted third party.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:44:29
The biggest threat is all the attacks that could potentially lead to a fork. 
If we take a step back, increasing the block size is not a scaling solution, it is just kicking the can down the road, and doing so repeatedly has negative consequences. 
However, there are several other solutions that will make bitcoin viable for other markets like micro payments and smart contracts. Both payment networks and side chains will expand bitcoins reach. They all make some kind of compromise to either security or something else, but they do it in parallel to the existing protocol. That way they are voluntary and doesn't tamper with the the security model of  the bottom protocol layer.
At least that's how I see it.

Charlie has a point though. From a technical point of view, miners can't create a fork. Miners just mine whatever blocks the network of nodes consider valid. And if they don't, they will be replaced surprisingly fast.
This is also what the big blockers got wrong. They thought the key to a successful fork was to convince the miners.
In order to move bitcoin in a new direction, you have to convince the nodes in the network, and the only way to do that is to propose a change that will move coins more efficiently for a lower price without ruining the censorship resistance.
Right now most people seem to think second layer networks will be more efficient in doing that than bigger blocks. But the truth is that at the end of they day the best solution will win, and nothing will be lost.
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:12:00


They do. Nobody has come out against SegWit on a technical level. 
They know how important SegWit is to everyone, so they decided to block it just so they could get what _they_ wanted, which is bigger blocks.
SegWit does increase the transaction capacity, but not in a way that miners can squeeze more fees out of, hence all the political blackmailing and horse trading. At least that's where I think all this comes from.

@_date: 2017-07-07 21:03:57


Sure, but that is true for anyone. Even a guy with 1% hash rate can have himself a hard fork if he wants.
It was always the full nodes that decided which blocks are valid. Mining anything else is not going to be profitable.
The idea that hash power decides the rules is a misunderstanding. Bitcoin never worked like that, and it was never meant to work like that either. Miners get payed more if they mine the transaction format that most nodes generate. If they mine a format that nobody uses, they get nothing, no matter how much power they put into it.
This is in fact the beauty of bitcoin, nobody gets to decide for their own.
Also, the miners are not as important as some of them like to think. If 20% hash power disappears, it will immediately become more profitable to mine, and someone will immediately take their place. Another beauty of bitcoin.

The general understanding among those who has been in this space for a while is that it will either go up in the future, or the whole thing will collapse, for example if someone breaks the cryptography, or if mining becomes too centralized and becomes a target for adversaries.

@_date: 2017-07-08 18:14:43
1. Data Immutability (The network of full nodes)
2. Distributed Computation (The miners)
3. Cryptography (The math)
When you generate a transaction, the nodes connected to you will verify the transaction. If it is not valid, it will die right there. They will not propagate it to the rest of the network, and therefore it will never reach any miners, and never end up in any blockchain.
If they find it to be valid, they will pass it on to more full nodes, which passes it to more nodes, so on and so forth. Eventually it propagates all the way to the miners. The miners will eventually include it in a block and then they announce that block to the network of full nodes, which again will verify that block and add it to their copy of the blockchain. At that point the transaction has actually happened. Not before.
As you can see, the full nodes are actually doing the most fundamental work in this network, validating transactions according to the rules, propagating transactions throughout the network, validating blocks and keeping a local copy of the blockchain which is what makes the transaction history immutable and infeasible to attack.
The most important functions the miners does is to make sure the order of the transactions ends up being the same on all the full nodes, proof of work which prevents spam and issuance of new coins.
So, removing any of those three pillars would make bitcoin completely pointless and ridiculous.

The problem with it is that it isn't a scaling solution. It's not even supposed to be. 
In order to improve scaling we need an algorithm, or some infrastructure, that allows the network to increase it's capacity over time. The efficiency of such algorithm could be linear, which won't be efficient enough to accommodate mass adoption, or it could be exponential which is probably what we need as a minimum.
Simply increasing the block size is neither. It is literally the same as kicking the can down the road.

He also built a miner into every node, and he described "One CPU one vote" in the whitepaper. You have to remember that this was going on in the early days. He wanted everyone to run a miner, and back then, we still hadn't seen specialized hardware like ASICS.
That said, I'm not saying anyone are wrong, and I'm not saying miners can not be nodes and vice versa. The problem we have now is about centralization of mining and control of the consensus rules. Try to find a quote where he speaks favorably about that.
He's idea was that miners will always do what is most economically beneficial. Not to take political control of the protocol rules and development, something they are not competent to do anyway.

Bigger blocks increases the capacity of the network linearly, but makes it less viable for Average Joe to both mine or even run a full node (responsible for verifying validity of transactions) because it also linearly increases the the disk space and bandwidth requirements.
Since this solution is linear it won't take long until we have to increase the block size again, and again, and again...
After a while both mining and verification has become monopolized, which in turn makes it an easy target for adversaries.
Too many people doesn't understand that this is the biggest threat to bitcoin. Decentralization of those properties has always been key.
On the other hand, using layer 2 networks to solve the scaling issue may have unwanted side effects as well, but at least it doesn't mess up the fundamentals of the underlying bitcoin network, and it should be able to scale exponentially, simply by adding more networks, or in the example of Lightning, adding more channels.

I don't see why changing the PoW algorithm would be a big deal. It is even supposed to be doable because of 51% attacks and quantum computers. Moving away from PoW would not be bitcoin though.

Looks like Electrum can import a WIF encoded key
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:56:20
It's basically a permanent account. You can keep using it indefinitely.
Even if your wallet creates more receiving addresses for you, which some wallets do, you can use any of them at any time.
@_date: 2017-07-14 05:55:33
You should start with getting a computer you trust.
If you don't want to download the blockchain, you could try the following:
1. start bitcoin-qt with the wallet.dat file you have coins on
2. In the bitcoin-qt console, use the dumpprivkey command to get the private key for your bitcoin address
3. Install electrum and create an account based on that private key
If that works, you should have a standard electrum account with your coins in it. Then you can create a hardware wallet account in electrum for your trezor. Finally you can transfer the coins from the standard wallet to the hardware wallet.
I haven't tried this myself, but as far as I know all this should be possible.
Btw, downloading the blockchain didn't take more than 10 hours or so for me on a 30/10 Mbps connection.
@_date: 2017-07-15 03:05:48
The seeding thing is getting out of hand. btc1, given their agenda, needs people to abandon the current development model, so changing the seed addresses is not a big surprise, and not really a conspiracy. Neither are the core seeds.

Maybe not, but I _do_ expect the actors that knows what bitcoin is (and what it can never be without being replaced with a simple SQL database), to let the market decide where we end up.

It would be interesting to see some models on how this would play out. How the incentives and fees shift to other parts of the system and so on. The current model does work quite well when it comes to incentives, even though I think full nodes could have been compensated in some way that doesn't skew incentives, or open paths that doesn't converge in a way that keeps the network decentralized.

There is no reason to believe it will. The reason Bitcoin is a good long term bet is because adoption of the technology is icreasingly meaningful and needed in huge parts of the world. But that kind of adoption doesn't happen in spikes.
Personally I would buy smaller amounts on a regular basis, and try to increase the amount during dips.
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:04:09
Bandwidth is a limited resource. The more bandwidth required, the bigger the advantage for the big miners. This trend has no equilibrium, it continues until there are only a couple of huge mining operations left. Those operations are easily controlled and manipulated by a central authority.
Another worrying fact is that bandwidth of that size are easily controlled by central authorities through ISP's. Politicians are already talking about giving different priority to different types of traffic. If they _can_ do it, the _will_ do it at some point.
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:05:28

From 3000 to 4000 is 25% increase.
Your investment of $100 would also have that 25% increase, so you would have $125 worth of bitcoin.

Sure, but this is a whole new way to develop bitcoin. So far the developers have use Linux as an example of how to develop a big project, and splitting the source into multiple camps isn't a good idea.

He is making several assumptions and narratives. I can't really say how relevant he's scenario is, but it seems he is talking about how a SegWit chain could have a disadvantage over a non SegWit chain given that enough nodes decides to attack it.
I guess this is one of the reasons core wanted as much as 95% support for it.
It seems to me like a hypothetical scenario just like the 51% attack. The threat will always be there whether we like it or not. In fact, I see a 51% attack to be more likely and more dangerous than this.

I think most of us would have been fine with a hard fork to 2MB if it was done right.
1. The core team is an obvious participant to any meetings about scaling, Jihan and Ver is not.
2. Stop doing all these embarrassing outbreaks, just get it right from the start, SegWith now and possibly 2MB hard fork later.
3. Keep politics out of it.

I'm not an expert on this, but I think too big blocks would cause issues with general purpose broadband speeds, and it would favor big players when it comes to block propagation and messaging over the network.

Right, hence they didn't choose to run either Classic, XP or Unlimited.
The real issue here is that Jihan &amp; Co. has been extremely juvenile approaching the core community, trying to overrun core for the fourth time, rather than having a mature discussion about issues and interests in the open. Maybe it's a honor thing or something. I'm pretty sure the Chinese honor codex isn't mentioned in the white paper.

This is the most relevant hint. Armory requires the bitcoin wallet to be installed, did you do that?
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:36:43
That's not what I worry about.
If Garzik &amp; co. are going solo, there will be a fork at some point, in particular when Jihan wants another bump in block size and are willing to pay for it.
If they are aiming at merging this patch if the majority of developers accept it as the best way forward, no harm has been done.

If the other wallet supports the format, sure
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:13:45
To start with, use the dumpprivkey command in the Bitcoin-Qt console window, giving it the bitcoin address that has coins on it, and see if you get the private key from that.

No. The device is completely independent, and it uses a standard seed format that can also be used to restore the private key on other wallets, like Mycelium or Electrum, if the device is broken or lost.

It would be logical to start by looking for traits that these people have in common. Things like religion, communities, background, behavior and so on. I would be surprised if these groups hasn't been mapped and identified quite thoroughly already.
When May says there should be no safe havens for these people online, she is showing her lack of insight and ability to think strategically and tactically. 
Then again, maybe her strategy is something else entirely. 
It's as if what she really want to do is to attack the internet, implying that it would eventually strike a terrorist or two. 
It appears very inefficient, expensive and destructive to everyone's privacy. I'm not buying it.
I think it is safe to assume that these politicians are more involved in creating a problem than they are in solving it, and the covert hacking tools leaked from NSA recently is a good indication of that.

It's impossible to predict the future, but if you ask me we are at the bottom of a recent dump. It seems to me that there is a large scale pump and dump operation going on these days.
Personally I expect the price to climb for some time now before it plummets again, and when it does, it shouldn't go as low as it did this time, simply because there is growth going on at the same time, establishing support at a higher level.
That's my guess.

@_date: 2017-06-15 12:58:52
I think this is a new kind of pump and dump. If you look at coinmarketcap all the coins are being dumped right now.
We have seen this a couple of times now in 2017.
Considering how hard it is to buy coins these days, it's either the exchanges them self, or a huge network of users/bots.
At this point I would guess that everything above $2000 is part of this pump and dump scheme, and once the dump is over, it will keep crawling up again.

@_date: 2017-06-13 23:48:02


You are implying that the system is perfect. It's not. It just have to be good enough to avoid 51% attacks.


There is a limit to how big the blocks can get before it ruins the security and integrity of the blockchain. We might as well find the ideal block size, rather than hammering on about this.


Again, the system is not perfect. Thanks to the security and integrity of a neutral and trustless system like bitcoin, many of these people have a real chance of improving their living standards. At least that's one of the things we are trying to achieve.


No, it will never be perfect, but as long as we keep the properties mentioned above, everyone doesn't have to run a node.


Governments collude, while making the impression that they don't. Forget it. I don't trust them to take care of something like this, and neither should you.

All coins are always stored in the blockchain.
A copy of the blockchain exists on all full node computers participating in the bitcoin network.
All that happens when you "move" the coins to your Electrum address is that the bitcoin network from now on associates those same coins with a new address.
I know this doesn't answer your question, but it's worth thinking about.
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:59:24
That's not a shill, it's a fact.
Most of us had our doubts at some point, and quite frankly, Roger Ver has donated coins to a lot of disruptive startups and organisations.
Trying to bypass a rather fragile development process by deliberately confusing the names of the coins, and the motives of the developers, is where I draw the line, but Cøbra never did that as I am aware of.

Bitcoin is gaining adoption among the general public, and they have no idea what all the fuzz means. Besides, the fight over the block size is in many ways hyped. I'm sure there is investors out there who would be fine if nothing changed. They are moving into bitcoin for other reasons.

@_date: 2017-06-13 01:16:20
There is several ways to do it. It kind of depends on your environment and the amount.
If you want to hold your own coins, an easy way to get started is to create an account using Electrum. Once you have secured the seed for your wallet you can delete the wallet file from disk if you want, to make sure it doesn't get stolen too easily.
There is also an Electrum App that can be used for day to day amounts.
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:11:30
Well, this is the challenge with Bitcoin. We have a good start and I don't want to ruin it. People have been looking into making PoW algorithms for general purpose computers since the beginning, including Satoshi, and there is a reason for that.
Raising the block size is a very simple and rudimentary way to scale, and raising it too much can have serious consequences for a p2p network.
Second layer solutions is a much better way, and opens many more possibilities
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:23:05
If the governments believe in democracy and free markets, they will participate. But we can't create software that depend on their whims. Democracy no longer works in most of the free world, and even if it did, power will corrupt this, as everything else.

I assume you mean a single increase in block size, which has nothing to do with scaling.
Why do you want this, is it so the miners can collect more fees, or so that more speculators can fill it up with more cross coin transactions?

Electrum has all you need, except for the blockchain.
If you want to keep a local copy of the blockchain, bitcoin core wallet will do that.
I'm not sure what the common way is to store the blockchain on an external drive, but if you are on a Linux system you could try to create a .bitcoin folder in your home directory and mount some external partition on it at boot, by editing the /etc/fstab file.

I don't think so. According to coinmarketcap.com all the coins are being dumped right now. It seems to me that this happens regularly now.

There are lots of good advice here already, but I want to add that the ability to research and understand complex systems is important.

Also, being persistent and not giving up during hard periods is key. This is also why it is important to find something rewarding to learn and experiment with, and stick with it. Time and persistence is the only way to get there.

Ethereum does everything you want. Why are you trying to force this on us?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:38:23
We are all doing our best.
But I have to say, back in the days, all the developers from all the interesting coins were friends and helped each other, and they still do. It was always the most obvious thing, and we were all in the same raft.
The fact that Ethereum are having some success is actually about time. All this fuzz about being the one is a bit hyped, even if I understand the concern.
If you think Ethereum has a technical advantage that Bitcoin doesn't have, buy some.
It's not too long ago Andreas Antonopoulos were talking about how there would be thousands of coins in the future :D
In many ways this is as expected, and all we can do is to be the best Bitcoin we can be.
Also, Ethereum has several issues that may eventually force them onto a path that doesn't even cross Bitcoin's

I would rather have used Electrum to generate a seed.
Write down the seed and store it safely.
You can delete the wallet.dat file if you don't want to have the private keys lying around on the PC.
The OS doesn't really delete files from the disk, it just removes the inode pointing to them, so this is not perfect security, but it should be good enough for most people.
Also, I'm not sure I would password encrypt the file either. The most common way to lose keys is to forget the password.

Before we answer that, we have to realize that there are two different prices here.

Governments collude, pretending they don't. My government doesn't give a flying f*** about me, or anyone else here, if it would cost them a business deal with some foreign private company who probably just want to collect data about our population in some form or another. 
So far they have been outsourcing everything from knowledge to production, leaving behind a massive trail of paperwork for the lawyers to play with.
We can vote all we want, governments are not going to respect the outcome, and when that happens, participation in voting will start dropping, as always.
If you really believed in the technology and incentives behind Bitcoin, you wouldn't ask for this. We don't need it.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:53:18
You are still not getting it. 
Mining has to be decentralized in order to preserve the neutrality, security and integrity of bitcoin. 
There is a reason that Satoshi built a miner into every node. 
This isn't exactly rocket science. Everyone who has been here since the beginning know this very well.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:32:48
In that case I don't see how fees, transaction time and backlogs can go up the way they do.
But, I'll admit it, increasing the block size will change things. If it didn't I wouldn't have a reason to say that it's a bad idea, which I do.
I have also said that raising the size once probably won't hurt, except that doing a hard fork is risky, and the only reason we consider doing it right now is because some guy with no rational reasoning insists on it.
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:27:36


both the operational and the governance requirements
of a range of applications – because you are not going to
move equity settlement, for example, to an environment
that cannot meet the disclosure requirements of capital

Economic Forum. “Capital markets regulators are not going
to change their view on what should and should not be

I would say the point of Bitcoin is to be a neutral, trustless and global store of programmable, exchangeable value that is shepherd by everyone and controlled by no one.
In this context value can be cash, proof of ownership, basic contracts and more.
It also allows people to own and control their bitcoin without any third parties involved.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:36:26
Increasing the block size isn't going to help. It will get filled with speculative spam in weeks, no matter how big you make it. In addition to that, it will drive out more and more participants in the network.
This is why there is no way around second layer solutions. 
If you think about it, with the current state of affairs, the fees get higher when adoption goes up. With second layer solutions like Lightning, the fees potentially goes down when adoption goes up.

Purchasing power depends on several things, including price of goods. If prices of goods fluctuate along with the price of bitcoins, the bitcoin would seem stable.

Where did you get the idea of "centralized hub"?
LN does to transactions what factorization does to equations. It is clever, and can go a long way. There is no reason to believe fees will become a problem, and if it did, people would turn to cheaper and better alternatives, or to sidechains like rootstock.
Second layer solutions could also help fungibility, working a bit like a mixer.
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:52:01
I think you are right, _if_ we can scale without necessarily increasing the block size.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:56:41
The most interesting thing about Craig is that Satoshi still hasn't appeared on the P2P Foundation website saying "I am not Craig Wright"
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:33:00
I'm not the only one who thinks this can work.
And if it doesn't, we should abandon the whole thing. It is not efficient compared to other available solutions (centralized databases, etc.)
Keeping out of reach from everyone is all we got. It's either that or nothing.


That's not all I'm doing. I also make sure it stays neutral and trustless until the developers find a way to scale without compromising the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-06-13 09:56:15


That's not how I see it. Layering can be very efficient when building complex systems. Just look at the layering of internet routing, or the TCP/IP network stack.
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:48:52
Software that stores a local copy of the blockchain is called full nodes. A full node are helping the network by validating and relaying transactions.
In addition to that, you don't have to trust anyone else.
By default, Electrum talks to a remote full node when doing transactions and lookups, so you are trusting someone else to provide correct information. However, you can configure Electrum to talk to your own full node if you want.
If you are new and just want to get started using bitcoin there is not much point in running a full node. You might consider it later though, since the security of the network improves with more full nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:39:59


They chose that them self. Bitcoin security doesn't depend on that. In fact, the best security comes from having thousands of miners spread all around the world. It was never supposed to converge into just a few.

The so-called New York agreement.


The core community and everyone who think they have made the best decisions so far.


It is neutral as long as nobody can control it despite of what the majority agrees with. Anyone else are free to fork away.


If more than 50% of the community wants what the core developers suggests, that is what we should get.
Hashpower were never supposed to overrule this.
Bitcoin is not a competition over power and influence, it was supposed to be neutral. Is it really that hard to understand?
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:57:24
Be careful with trading around end of July, beginning of August. There is a soft fork going on at that time, so keep an eye on it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:17:15
If LN doesn't do what people expect, another, more decentralized network will be created and used. In addition to that there will also be side chains. It's amazing what competition can do, I mean, if you asked someone from the sixteenth century if it was possible to land on the moon, they would probably imagine a very tall ladder or something.
 As long as the layer 1 is neutral and trustless, we're good. I'm not necessarily against slightly bigger blocks, but it isn't going to save us in the long run.
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:07:43
We have to find a way to scale that doesn't prevent nodes and miners to operate efficiently on a general purpose broadband connection.
If it hadn't been for that, on-chain scaling would have been fine.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:34:15
The fees solves several issues, one of them is to prevent spam.
If transactions are free of charge, anyone can flood the network, and hence the blockchain, with transactions.
I haven't heard of any viable solutions to getting completely rid of fees so far.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:49:56

This is why fiat money has become so dumb.

It seems to go up in price, but that is certainly not because it has become easier to buy. It is much harder than what it used to be, and we see posts here all the time from people being stuck in some KYC related quagmire.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:40:54
I think many of us would accept a bump in block size, but allowing the protocol to scale up and down based on heuristics sounds like a terrible idea. 
Making it easier to increase the size in the future also seems misguided and the opposite of what we actually need if we want to keep layer 1 decentralized.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:30:35
The whole point of Bitcoin is to be neutral and trustless. If it was possible to freeze an account like that, bitcoin would not be censorship resistant. Not only that, but someone with a gun, lets say a government, could say "Miners, transfer 10000 bitcoins to 1fYUst6w5AsafYu762gG18sdk9dj01Bmzc7Uy7st3d or else..."

@_date: 2017-06-24 16:15:39
Yeah, lets just keep them in the dark for now
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:50:22
The miners we are talking about here wants control and influence. They see them self as more important, and therefore should get to decide. This is very obvious to anyone who has been following what these guys have said publicly.
The protocol can not favour some over others. It has to stay neutral. Those who thinks controlling the evolution of the protocol is a good idea are either incompetent, or too immature to understand their own best interest.
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:58:16


Then you should educate yourself. I'm not making a point, I'm stating a fact, and those who understands the technology behind bitcoin knows this.
In order to preserve the security, integrity and neutrality of the network we have to find a way to keep mining decentralized.
Those who thinks bitcoin is some hype thing to push up the price should go take a look at one of the ICO's out there, they are designed for that kind of thing. No need to ruin bitcoin for that.
All the stupid outbreaks that have been going on have done everything wrong when it comes to the development of this technology.
Just do the right thing, the right way, in the right order and for the right reasons. That's all it takes.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:26:09

I can't see how that can be the case. There has been uncertainty many times and it doesn't seem to affect big money much. Also, the fact that all the top 100 coins are being dumped simultaneously indicates that Bitcoin is not the target here.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:20:48
Multi-national corporations has captured pretty much everything from resources to political power. Hoarding doesn't cower what is going on. We are past that point.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:52:57
I doubt it. Only a few bitcoin developers are getting payed by Blockstream, other than that, bitcoin is a open and independent project as always.
Everything Blockstream has done so far follows the rules and principles of open source software and governance.
Also notice how Blockstream doesn't complain when other coins merge Lightning into their code, in fact they are helping out.
That's a lot better than having closed meetings and outbreaks of developers working for Jihan and Ver.
At this point there is no conspiracy in sight, so please stop yelling
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:17:41
Both second layer networks and side chains should be able to help making a neutral and trustless bitcoin accessible to most people.
But, if a block size increase is necessary, I would agree to it on the following condition:
I don't want to see or hear from miners ever again. They were never supposed to materialize as political or technological adversaries. This is a serious flaw that needs to be addressed.

@_date: 2017-06-14 04:45:02
I'm not an expert, but I can say that Litecoin is much more like bitcoin, so the technology is sound. When they say Litecoin is silver to Bitcoins gold, it makes a lot of sense. So no, that doesn't apply to Litecoin.
I have some Litecoin myself. I'm not sure what I think about it's price prospects. To me, the most interesting part about it is that Lightning may be used to transfer value between Litecoin and Bitcoin in not so distant future, and that it could attract developers from Bitcoin if something goes wrong with BIP148. The question is if Litecoin has anything to add to Bitcoin, like a specific market. I can't really see that right now. Unless Bitcoin fails to apply SegWit.
I consider Ethereum much more speculative both on technology, politics and investments. I think it is much more likely to go either up or down than Litecoin.

A new address is generated for each receive, and you can send coins to any of them at any time. Basically, you get a chain of addresses, all derived from the private key.
Also, you will not see your coins until bitcoind has downloaded the whole blockchain (can take a couple of days), and your transaction has been included in a block (can take hours depending on the amount of fee and current traffic)
What you can do in the mean time is go to a online block explorer, paste in the bitcoin address you transferred coins to, and see if it has coins
PS. 
As long as you have the private key you are fine. Even if Armory doesn't work for some reason, there is other wallets you can use to import that private key.

Um, that's not a point, that's a question without a question mark.
Anyway, science indicates that we apply SegWit now. That will allow for more transactions per block and buy us time to prepare for a hard fork later if necessary.
Unfortunately, something as ugly as politics are trying to force us to do things backwards based on irrelevant and personal reasons, as usual.

It seems to me that the exchanges has put us in this situation.
We pretty much knew this would happen at some point, and the exchanges chose to obey The Miner and he's motley crew of developers rather than safe guarding bitcoin on behalf of their users.

In terms of scaling, there is no difference between 1MB, 4MB or 8MB.

It would be nice if every fuse box out there had a builtin miner and a wallet.
Since everyone has one, mining would be properly decentralized, and we could fill up our fuse boxes with bitcoins and let it buy power for us

You are trying not to get my point. I have already said why bigger blocks is a limited resource if we want to stay decentralized.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:00:39
We have to make some choices about what a decentralized network can do in a safe manner without compromising security and network distribution. 
Nobody said bitcoin would be able to solve everything for everyone. The closest scenario I can think of, if we want to be able to buy coffee or whatever, is to use coffeecoin designed for many small transactions, and make it compatible with something like Lightning so that we can use cross-coin payments to move value into the chain we want to use for some specific use-case.

@_date: 2017-06-26 18:11:23
First of all, they hard forked after the DAO scandal in order to please investors. Even if this seemed reasonable, it shouldn't be possible. It shows that the Ethereum blockchain was not immutable as it was supposed to be, and probably still isn't.
Second, they are running around the globe trying to add features and adjust every aspect of the software in order to please whoever it is. This is terrible management and is unlikely to end well.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:23:08

You have to use the full path of the executable.

Several world wide networks of executing transactions and settlements including all their infrastructure.
Unlike Bitcoin, Swift, Visa, and others are both expensive and unavailable in most of the third world.
Take Nigeria for example, they have plenty of sun energy, but storing and transferring that energy is a problem. What they can do instead is to put up a crypto-mining operation right at the solar panels and convert that energy to storable, persistent value instead, which will benefit them economically as well as every one else who needs to do reliable transactions.

If you have a rocket that goes 10 meters up in the air, and you increase the amount of fuel and the size of the fuel tank, you might get 15 meters. Another doubling might get you to 17 meters.
Continuously increasing the block size isn't going to work out well, and it will kill decentralization of the network pretty fast.
I have no doubt Jihan Wu and the communist party would love to see this happening.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:40:11
I have tried but it didn't work. To them, bitcoin is just a price barometer
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:21:29
Imagine this:
There is no coins, in the same way that there is no spoon. Not on your computer, or anywhere else.
When "bitcoin" is transferred to your address, what really happens is that the distributed network of nodes agrees that these coins are from now on associated with your address, and your private key is required to generate a valid transaction that will convince the network that the coins should be associated with the next owners address.
In a way, the private key does not give you access to the coins, rather it gives you the ability to move the coins on to the next owner.
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:10:30
No, you don't have to be online. If the address you sent to is correct, and you have the private key for it, everything should be fine.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:48:26
You are not getting it at all. There is several ways to scale, and continually increasing the block size is the worst of them, because it will destroy one of the most important property of bitcoin which is decentralization.
If we can make bitcoin viable for buying coffee without compromising the security and distribution of the network, that would be great, and we can, by using second layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:54:09
That's a good question.
Using a European exchange seems like a way to go. I also believe Coinbase provides services in Europe. Personally I would consider having a solid relationship with a well regarded trader on LocalBitcoins.com
In either case I would buy relatively small amounts at a time.
But before anything, get your self a hardware wallet if you haven't already. I can personally recommend Trezor. And learn how to use it before you start buying too much.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:10:20
Okay, I though UK were part of that

I will accept addressing ASICBOOST on one condition, that the 2MB block increase is removed for now.
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:00:47
I don't see layer 1 ever becoming the payment network. The block size required would be astronomical, and both mining and full-nodes are already too centralized.
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:31:52
Once we get SegWit enabled a lot of possibilities opens up. The kind of business you are talking about will probably implement some kind of second layer solution, based on something like the Lightning network.
SegWit itself will buy us some time to get these second layer payment networks up and running.
At least that's what I'm hoping for.
Also, we have to remember it were never a guarantee that bitcoin would be the only show in town. It's quite amazing that it has been at the top for so long, but we should expect some other coins to be part of the competition as well.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, and in my opinion bitcoin should continue to be a conservative store of value first and foremost. Second layer solutions will have to take us into specialized markets.
In fact, looking back, the threat of losing control of decentralization, development and the ability to move forward has always been right by our side. I think bitcoin has done everything right so far and I trust it far more than any other coin when it comes to not stepping into any traps.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:59:37

If you are using an exchange, you typically have to create an account with them and use their platform to buy. After that you can transfer the coins to your own wallet if you want to.
You can also use  if you want to buy directly from a trader.

No, it is the only way to get a patch accepted to Bitcoin (Core)


No it isn't. There is only one way to get anything merged with Bitcoin (Core).
It's a patch created by a couple of guys to come up with a solution to a specific issue. 
If it doesn't get accepted and merged by the 100+ developers that has been working on Bitcoin for the last 10 years, no one in their right mind is going to run it.


No, I'm just not stupid enough to alienate 100+ developers doing hard research and creating really interesting technology.

The best answer to this is that crypto-currencies are here to stay because it is a technological break through. Any government or bank that tries to fight it will find them self on the wrong side of history. And they know that.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:43:42
Well, I'm not against digital cash, the thing is that increasing the block size once is not scaling, it's kicking the can down the road, at best. And there is a price to it that we don't want to pay if we don't have to.
In order to actually scale using block size, we would have to double the size regularly. That is a very rudimentary way to solve the scaling problem, and the price for doing it is completely detrimental to a system that needs to stay trustless.
The way I see it, there are some people who thinks cut-throat, Darwinist capitalism is some gift from God or something.
The thing is, Bitcoin was not designed to create winners. It was designed to be a neutral, trustless medium of exchange.
Those are not compatible.
Maybe you see it, but there is a lot of people here now that doesn't, and they really need to take a closer look at second layer solutions
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:08:14


Yes, but this doesn't prevent centralization, and hence the inevitable corporate scam.


So what is your solution to increasing that number?
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:32:05
Passwords doesn't make any sense. You have the private key, which is required in order to create a valid transaction that moves coins on to the next owner. Then there is the public key which is derived from the private key.
The private key is just a random number that is selected from a sample space that is so large that nobody can ever guess it.
The public key is used as your bitcoin address. It is not necessary to keep it a secret because you can't derive the private key from the public key.
Wallets that optionally asks for a password is doing so in order to encrypt the file that the private key is stored in.
This is not required for anything to work. It just makes it less likely for someone so steal the private key from your PC.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:18:36


I believe this is the main reason for the current, uneducated hype
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:59:32
It's not that easy.
Buying that much would drive the price up enormously, and as good hodlers we would wait it out. Besides, there is limited supply.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:53:56
In engineering, scaling is a measurement of how well an algorithm increases efficiency and/or capacity as the input gets bigger.
A single step doesn't count as scaling. If we keep doubling the size of the blocks indefinitely, it could be considered a very rudimentary, naive form of scaling.
Second layer networks is a much better tool for dealing with these issues, and they can do it without compromising the decentralized nature of the layer 1 network we have now. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:53:49
I don't think you have to wait for the blockchain to download. The console in the core wallet has a command "dumpprivkey" to get the private key for an address 
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:09:17
There is so many morons who doesn't understand where bitcoin came from, why it is here, and what it takes to ruin it.
Proving that UASF BIP148 can be done is pretty much our only hope at this point.
If major exchanges want to change bitcoin into the typical corporate coin that doesn't even keep developers around, it's not much we can do.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:24:26
Sorry to tell you, but if that was even possible, bitcoin would be useless
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:04:29

I didn't read Amir's argument to be that the negative news about SilkRoad lead to the first wave of adoption.

This would not be a problem, or even a possibility if there are enough nodes on the network. And the same goes for mining.
In fact, in that scenario it would be a good thing. The more nodes the better.

You don't even know what consensus means when it comes to bitcoin. The more independent nodes and miners we have in the network, the better the security gets. And the neutrality, and the integrity.
In bitcoin consensus simply means the majority. It is not supposed to work like a boardroom with a handful of members agreeing among them self. That's the whole point of this technology for Gods sake.
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:39:05
It would be nice if someone who understands the bitcoin basics could make a writeup like this.
In particular, the game theory that makes bitcoin a neutral and trustless medium, shepherd by everyone, controlled by no one.
There seems to be a lot of talk about game theory these days and it appears to consider the psychology around online discussions.
Sure, there is game theory involved in those, but that is not the game theory we talk about in regards to bitcoin.
People like Satoshi and others who started this thing had a vision for this neutral and trustless network. Creating a set of rules that
provides these properties, as well as implementing them in a secure way, is hard.
When trying to lay down these rules in a way that will allow bitcoin to be neutral and trustless in a sustainable way, game theory is one of the fields that have to be understood and taken into consideration.
Basically how the rules are going to affect the different components, specially when considering all the hostile attacks something like this will be subject to.
Bitcoin was not designed to create winners or losers. It was designed to be a neutral and trustless medium of exchange.
People who try to change bitcoin in order to make them self some kind of winner simply doesn't get it, and should be told so in a very clear way (That's where the OSS development model and BIP proposals come in)
To put it bluntly, if we see "winners" when it comes to mining, or controlling the rules or development, we have lost. Plain and simple.
It's about time people realize that the core developers have been laying down a secure and wise path for all these years. They have done it without compromising the properties that makes bitcoin bitcoin, and they have done so in time. 
If it hadn't been for all the stupid renegades fueled by Ver, Jihan and others, we wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.
Chances are we would have been drinking cocktails with little straw hats, discussing how to squeeze the most out of Lightning, or some other second layer solution.

You mean when the network was bootstrapped, and provided no security what so ever?
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:47:46
Who knows. The discussions about scaling around here doesn't seem to matter much really.
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:12:11
It never occurred to me we would have to explain these things
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:52:29
That's great, keep up the good work

Just make sure you write down the seed for the wallet. As long as you have that you're safe
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:13:42
I concur
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:43:51


Not for long. 


I want lower fees, but I don't want them by ruining the bottom layer by continuously increasing the block size.
The second layer can be used for everything from coffee to high frequency trading.
Let them go at it with everything they got. At least, when it blows up, we still have our decentralized layer 1 network intact.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:39:25
I believe so
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:43:07
It does.
Basically, install Electrum, create a wallet, go to the "Receive" tab to get a receive address.
Then, go to Coinbase and withdraw your coins to that address.
I haven't used Coinbase myself but that should be the steps more or less.
Make sure you write down the seed that Electrum gives you when you create the account. You can use that to restore your account at any time, on any computer.
You should also be aware that Electrum stores the private key in a file called wallet.dat (If I remember correctly)
You don't want this file to be stolen, or read by anyone!
If you are not going to do any transactions for a while you can just delete this file. It will be regenerated when you restore your account from the seed.

I don't know about the republicans, but I can assure you Socialism is nothing but a utopian academic experiment that could never work in the real world.
It's amazing how people fail to understand that this reality is a never ending flow of opportunities, not entitlements handed to you for nothing.
If you want to be useful to others, give them the same opportunities that you had. Don't make it your mission to take from everyone and give it to a few you know about. The Robin Hood thing doesn't work at scale, and it doesn't work over time.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:06:25
That's true, but they are all victims of the same game theory at this point.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:53:50
No, this is happening to all coins, just look at coinmarketcap.com
This can only be a cooperating group of miners.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:20:54
There is probably plenty of ways to do it from the UK, including using an ATM.
If you go for an exchange, chances are you will have to provide some personal info, and wait a while for the account to be activated.
Some typical exchanges would be Coinbase and Kraken.
There is also a dutch exchange that I have heard good things about

Electrum connects to online servers. Take a look at which server they are connected to, under "network" or something. Are they connecting to the same server?

He seems poorly informed, cherry picking skeptical arguments.
Bitcoin has revolution built into it. Deal with it.

It's tempting to go binary on this one. Long term, you either remove "incompatible" culture and religion from within your borders, or you go much deeper into what immigration requires and how to succeed with it.
Short term, actively approach the groups we are talking about here. If MI5 etc has been focusing on their job, they shouldn't be too hard to identify. This is of course harder than it sounds, specially if the general population doesn't cooperate.
I really don't have any better answers.

That's true, but they have a huge disadvantage, the old economic model is collapsing. In fact, governments need crypto more than crypto needs them at this point. And that's just speaking for the first world countries.

The line between a dubious and a regular actor is when you start posing that BCH _is_ BTC.
Is he really a dubious actor?

Can't wait to get rid of those idiots.
I bet the BU shill around here will disappear about the same time
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:47:10
That's a stretch. I would say the financial crisis and the terrorizing state of global economics are more likely some of Satoshis motivations.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:33:12
Are you saying that a Chinese miner should decide what the Bitcoin protocol rules should be?
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:06:14
It depends how you see it. Core has never made any rash decisions. This all started when someone wanted to break out, ignore the development model and redefine bitcoin for them self.
There is nothing wrong with that, but they shouldn't have tried to use the bitcoin name.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:31:26
Unless I'm a complete retard, this guy is spot on.
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:26:20
If you want a simple solution, I suggest installing Electrum, create an account (make sure you write down the seed correctly) and transfer your coins to it.
Personally I keep my coins in Electrum, but I wouldn't be too worried about having some on Coinbase either.

This is what people doesn't understand, including gold bugs. The most important property of gold that made it work as a currency was that it was useless.
Secondary, it was scarce and divisible.
The idea that it was useful as jewelry is ridiculous. It was only used for jewelry because it was valuable. And it was valuable because people accepted it as a store of value and a medium of exchange.

Gavin always seemed nice. He's Achilles heel though is he's meeting with CIA.
If Satoshi is in fact CIA, a lot of bricks falls into place around Gavin, like pushing for bigger blocks, partnering with Mike Hearn and endorsing Craig Wright, who has been warning against SegWit in rather peculiar ways.

It good to know that $5.5 billion has been spent on this, rather than spending some on open source systems which is our best defense against worms like WannaCry

You are talking about two different prices. Only one of them are inflated.
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:15:30
Your welcome.
By the way, Electrum allows you to encrypt your wallet with a password. What this does is to encrypt the wallet.dat file.
That's probably a more convenient option than deleting the file. Just make sure you use a good password, and type it down on the same paper where you have the seed.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:13:45
A good question, someone give us a solid answer please.
