You don't have to do anything.  Bitcoin is ultimately about freedom.  I was just stating as a matter of opinion that his views share some common threads with the Bitcoin community.

As opposed to a "community organizer"?  At least Paul ran a successful business in the form of a private medical practice.

He's actually not anti-education.  He's against the Federal Government running something that is much better facilitated on the local level.  Paul's views are decentralist in nature and should be popular with anyone who's into Bitcoin or alt/crypto currencies in general.    
  
The fact that you are on a Bitcoin thread stating the Gold standard is fucking stupid seems weird to me because the same instrisic economic principle of currency being backed by some sort of finite resource, be it gold or math should resonate with any bitcoiner.

Frighteningly, there are about 3 single points of failure in the United States alone

What?!  Can you source the outrageous comment you made?  What does that even mean "has their SSL keys"?  You mean Russia has the private keys to WL SSL certs?
I find this highly unlikely and think you may be watching a bit too much CNN.  WL has always been a journo org without any govt ties.

Calling a journalism organization that exists solely to facilitate the leaking of government abuse a foreign intelligence front.  Pot meet kettle

Downvoted for asking for sauce.  The absolute state of Plebbit

I think you're confused friendo.  DTJR met with a Russian Lawyer who used to work for the Russian Govt.  You just fell for the Russia Bogeyman meme the mainstream has been pushing to distract from the actual content of the leaks.  Go read the leaks, they are damning for HRC, podesta, the DNC and the global elite.  Pretty obvious why they want you to discount the content and mistrust the source.

I don't even have a TV retard.  Fox, msnbc, CNN, etc are owned by the same 6 megacorps.  You should try thinking for yourself sometime

They did release stuff on Russia, and can easily be found.  There was no dirt on Trump, but Assange was asking for people to leak if there is

You obviously weren't alive during the Clinton/Lewinsky special council.

Loling too, since I personally would love to see it.  Hasn't there been a special counsel in place for over a year digging for something to connect Russian "interference" with DT?  HRCs dirt is being covered up daily, but the entire political apparatus has been digging on Trump.  Where's the beef?
