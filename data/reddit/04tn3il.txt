You think 25% is low battery? You need to take a ride on the wild side at 5% while driving home listening to a podcast

This is bullshit fuck society .. they’re all a bunch of psychopaths just trying to figure out the next way way to fuck someone to benefit themselves. I work in business development and it’s like we are supposed to working together to you know .. build the business and all everyone does is claw and scratch to get ahead for themselves with no concern for the company or the people they work with. I’m stacking up so I can wake up, smoke some ganja, tend to my garden and chickens, excercise, fuck my wife, ride dirtbikes, chill in my steam room, read a fucking books and listen to the motha fuckin Joe Rogan podcast.

I tend to veer on the this is a risky investment and anything is to be expected philosophy rather than the dumb ass “invested more than could afford to lose.” When I go to the casino and lose $1k it is by no means going to have any impact to me financially but that doesn’t mean I can’t be pissed. I am well aware of the risks, but am I happy bitcoin is so low .. no I am not. Am I going to spew nonsense on reddit.. no I’m not. So looking from the outside in according to fit in with the crypto mentality .. I must buy and not complain when it goes down because that means I invested more than I can lose and I must HODL even though everything tells me to sell. So to sum everything up no I have nothing to add.. people should not blame others for their losses and people should not assume since someone is pissed about losing money that they invested more than they can lose. When people say that shit it just screams that you are a dumbass because you take pride in losing money because you could afford to lose it.
