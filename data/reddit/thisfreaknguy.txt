When a man falls in love, it is advised he wait to propose until he can afford the three rings: the engagement ring, the wedding ring, and the suffering.

I'll take it off your hands for $20 plus shipping (assuming you are in the US). 
No need to answer right away, this offer won't expire.

Okay wow. I really need to do some more reading on this because it definitely seems huge, that's for sure! Thanks for the info.

Random question out of curiosity: wouldn't this be less profitable than buying high and selling low? Or did China have way to easily move fiat between exchanges?
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:58:58
Pardon my ignorance, but wouldn't this drive the price up and cause a greater volume to be bought and sold as people try to take advantage of the rising trend?

I suppose it might for someone interested in mining an altcoin, but the only coins I am interested (bitcoin and litecoin) already have a difficulty that makes your jalapeno not worth mining with. I just want it as a gift for a friend of mine who was big on GPU mining back when it was still profitable. Feel free to try and sell it else where, but if all else fails I will take it off your hands.

Pardon my ignorance, but what is the expected ETF bubble?

Noob question: what if someone has the .dat file for the main wallet(s)? Would they be able to remotely recover anything?
@_date: 2015-05-28 03:08:48
So it this profitable or just for the good of the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:38:45
Unfortunately, yes.

What exactly is going on in China? I heard something about digital currencies being banned/ illegal? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:13:12
Why? If they threw out 950, I doubt they were very secure in the first place.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:51:50
Pardon my ignorance, but what's the ruckus about? I thought litecoin did something with segwit and turned out just fine. 
Disclaimer: I am very much out of the loop when it comes to these things.

Do you have to make a new account or can you use your coinbase account?
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:42:23
Alas, we may never know. Such is life. 
AND I HATE IT!!

Sorry for being out of the loop, but what happened to btce?

Hey man. The quarter I flip hasn't been wrong yet! 50/50 nothing. This is a well educated coin! I mean, it is a physical crypto so I guess he has the inside track what with them being family and all.

I actually have the magazine that article was printed in. I consider it my own little slice of history.

Well dang. Thanks man.

Wouldn't this make the price of coins rise over the next few days seeing as the supply goes down as the demand stays relatively constant?
@_date: 2013-10-07 06:32:24
But the two jalapenos I purchased from BFL have come in, and now three weeks later are past ROI and making a profit. I am in no way endorsing the cesspool of false promises that place has become (I too am still waiting on a 30Gh/s and a 60 Gh/s) but surely there are some ASIC's out there that can still make some decent coin?

The economy is bad enough as is, and you want to take away less fortunate AMERICANS' life blood? There are plenty who would replace the ones who could not afford to work anymore for the pennies the job would offer. You'd be surprised what a man will do when he's hungry enough. Yet you want to make AMERICANS with family's and bills go hungry while they look for another job just so some people can save a few bucks?? You don't get hired just because you are hungry. A crying child does not get you a job. Fate smiles on some and frowns on others, and these AMERICANS have swallowed their pride, worked a grunt job sometimes dealing with people that make them hate the planet earth, remained in control as some entitled prick berates them for something that wasn't their fault, patiently trucking through picky old ladies and screaming children, and moving on to the next table with a smile to hide the rage boiling within them, all so they can eat and have a place to stay. You expect us to spit on AMERICANS who have flipped fate the bird, refused to roll over and die, gone out and got themselves a job, a source of income? You expect us to abandon fellow AMERICANS who are doing what they can to get by? Now I'm not saying every server is poor, but it'll be a cold day in hell before we turn our backs on these men and women, our fellow AMERICANS, so some greedy sticklers who can apparently afford to eat out but not throw their waiter a bone for their time and patience can avoid giving up a few more bucks, all on the whim that some foreign douche bag says they should all loose their jobs. You are certainly entitled to your own opinion and I can see how this may offend some, but on behalf of myself and my fellow, like-minded AMERICANS.... Screw You.

Bfl's shipping status is different for each model. Where the jalapanoes haven't quite been shipped through September 2012 orders, the singles haven't even been shipped past July 2012 orders. I'm in the same boat as you and boy howdy is it going to take a while.

I've been trying to move some money from my dwolla account into my mtgox account through your site as I have done so many times in the past, but as of yesterday I can't seem to find out how to do it with the new format. Help?

I haven't had any experience with bitstamp. How easy is it to withdraw funds?
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:37:25
@_date: 2013-07-02 08:17:10
Is there any place you can check on how far they are in shipping? Or do you just wait for updates?

Is there ANY way to get money (USD) out of mt gox?
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:23:14
Doesn't mt gox do wire transfers? Or is that yet another thing they have neglected?
@_date: 2013-07-10 04:42:20
So seeing as how google is how I found BFL in the first place, what would be recommended as a good alternative source for ASIC's?
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:45:25
Wow. Okay then. Thank you very much for the help.
