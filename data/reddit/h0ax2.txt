What's the difference between lowest fees and cheapest?

That doesn't look like a dedicated bitcoin thing? Is their a benefit to this over Coinbase or Kraken or the others I've heard about?

Never bought bitcoin before, If I want to buy strictly for investing/hodling, what website has the lowest fees for credit card/bank transfer? What one do you recommend?

Hi guys, trying to buy some bitcoin for the first time using a limit order on Coinbase Pro:
[What options do I pick here?](
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:03:18
How comes there's a lot of poo-poo about coinbase on Or is coinbase pro completely different?
Also, is there somewhere online with a list of the different services and their fees/prices?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:24:23
But how do I get money onto Coinbase Pro, is it not a 4% fee?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:29:20
How? Bank transfer?
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:20:14
Cool, I've done that. A shame I can't trade on the BTC:USD market, seems like there's no way of converting EUR/GBP to it

Deposit Fees 	
Cryptocurrency: None
ACH: None
SEPA: €0.15 EUR
Wire transfer: $10 USD 
I found this. I don't know which one bank transfer is, is it wire?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:27:51
But I still need to get the GBP into the account, which is at 4% apparently. Also for limit orders, what value do I place them at?
