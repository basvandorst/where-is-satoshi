to be more specific, I have 2 computers one of which I use for cold storage which has never been connected to the internet. The computer where I cold store my coins is using the same linux distro (mint 14) as my online computer, which is vulnerable to the bash bug, 
do you think that I will have to update my offline computer with a newer version of mint since it is using a version the bash bug is vulnerable on? 
hope this is a bit more clear,

not on the web via terminal i get this error, i think it has to do something with the severs im trying to download the updates from but everything im doing following google is leading me to dead ends since im not to versed in linux 
gonna keep at it or just cold store the coins since im only updating my online computer,

This is a test 
after typing in the command, does that mean i have to update? also after trying to do update i get error 404 messages, and apt-get install says that im already running the latest version

im using linux mint 14 but am sitting here getting ready to upgrade it to linux mint 17, 
right now my cold storage wallet (bitcoin armory) is on the same distro im using right now (linux mint 14) for a computer that has never seen the internet since a fresh installation do i have to upgrade my cold storage computer as well? 
not worried at all just making sure that im up do date with safety the chances of getting exploited is probably slim to none and would just be extremely unlucky if it were to happen to someone, 
thanks for your input
