So true. 200 bits @_date: 2014-07-29 01:54:58
Great! I've inboxed you with a bit more about the overall vision / my own background. Let's chat further there so we don't clog up the thread.

Not thousands, but I am putting a lot of my own time (development / design) and a reasonable amount of money into this. The rate would depend on the author / experience, but I am paying fairly and at market rates for content. When stacked up against my other projects the content for this site is getting priority - normally I could get articles written very cheaply through crowd sourcing but I'm trying to avoid that here so I can make a better quality product instead of just trying to turn it into another cheap ad-sense revenue stream.

Thank-you very much! Appreciated.

Agree. The theme is a placeholder at the moment - it will be replaced soon

Honestly - how do you find it these days? I gave it a fair go as my default browser back in February and it was quite horrid - I found myself using the "!g" so much for anything non-technical that I had to give up on it

I don't think we can quite discount that yet - there's a lot of reasons people go into the bank beyond their individual banking needs.

In this case they must follow [this]( law for poker/American citizens specifically. Australia has a version of this as well (see: [IGA]( that could potentially affect Australian exchanges in the future.

There's evident steps in this direction when companies such as Overstock are retaining BTC, however I do understand why a company such as Dell is going to be more hesitant. Really, until the Tax and Legal landscapes become more clear in the US and abroad I don't think we can expect too much progress in this space with the corporate players given the amount of unclear risk involved.
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:17:48
I'd like to think so, but the corporate world isn't that agile. It would cost a significant amount of internal resources to change those processes for relatively little (if any?) gain.

Happy birthday from the team at [coinmanual.com]( birthday-cake @_date: 2014-04-05 10:21:30
Fair enough, thank-you very much for a reasoned response.

A bit childish given how mainstream general knowledge of the internet is now, don't you think?
@_date: 2014-08-05 06:37:51
I'd rather they kept it up. It engages an audience better and makes everything look more legitimate (from a layman's perspective). When they read / learn about it they will find out more, so where's the harm? If they changed away from this, what graphic would they use that would have the same impact?
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:13:32
Great minds think alike :)

Do you mind elaborating? More information is always better!
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:12:24
This is going to be a very common problem though, incorporating Bitcoin is hard enough to begin with - finance departments will struggle to understand it, and the implementation. Tacking on international markets to that takes time. At least they're making inroads though!

They're an American company aren't they? I'm guessing that you're an American citizen, and Coinbase is following the law according to the [UIGEA](

To be fair: You're not going to overcome with bespoke software what the open source community has already tried with far more significant man hours and feedback loops

I'm new, but trying to find good writers to build more of an information source then a clickbait news source:  Finding good, reasonable writers is very hard though, so it's a slow road.

I'm a software engineer with a financial services background and this shouldn't be a mistake you can make if they were to follow best practice (Model, View, Controller). This clearly shows that they weren't doing that. I definitely agree that the test team has a lot to answer for here, but I'd be lopping heads in the development team well before that.

Maybe it appeared fine from a consumption viewpoint but web developers / businesses have been up against the wall with domain squatters for a long time. More TLD's is a massive sigh of relief and helps to alleviate that problem (it can never solve it as there will always be squatters, but it's a lot more expensive / spurious now then it was before).
