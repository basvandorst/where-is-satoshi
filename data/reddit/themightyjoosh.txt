Question about setting custom fees on Ledger Nano S bitcoin segwit transaction: I see the mempool is doing quite well now and 140-200 sat/b fees are being included in blocks (Yay!). I went to make a Tx from my edger (first time) and set fee to 200sat/b. Once the transaction is sent I check block explorer and the fee has actually been set to 132sat/b. This is a problem. Which is the actual fee ratio? Is it a segwit thing that the fee is displayed lower and i don't have to worry? Or is my actual fee 132? Because if it is it will take a long time to confirm. Also, if this is the case, how is it possible to know the actual sat/b before confirming? Either way this seems like a pretty big design flaw.
Edit: Furthermore how can I update the tx with higher fees if need be? Thans for any help!

There's gotta be more panels that aren't included in this version

Thanks for the help. I've uploaded my seed onto electrum but it has not imported the previous transations onto electrum i.e. the balance is zero. I see the load transactions from file etc option but I don't know how to do this. Do You?
Edit: I deleted and reuploaded the wallet and the funds synchronized properly

Hey I have a Segwit question. I currently use Coinomi and want to transfer my BTC to my ledger segwit address. If I load up my coinomi wallet seed onto a segwit address like Electrum, will the transaction from Electrum to Ledger then be a segwit transaction?

That's the problem. Maybe LN will help, if it works. We don't know if it will work. We don't know when 2018, 2019, 2020? Meanwhile segwit adoption is poor and exchanges aren't grouping transactions, clogging up the network. These issues need solving before LN will come and the longer it takes, the more time there is for the market to reconsider bitcoin as the frontrunner.

But those were futures after the snapshot. has the actual blockchain gone live or is it still being premined by the scamlords?

Can anyone tell me what the latest is with BTG and how/where/when I can sell it? Seems to have gone quiet since the snapshot. Is it available to claim yet? Thanks team

Comparing the chart of bitcoin to the value of a company seems like a very strange prediction model to me. You're making many assumptions to pull any value out of that. Stick to promoting the technology folks

If this is not a troll post I am seriously concerned about your view on personal finance let alone world view.
I also hope 'price prize' was a well chosen pun

How long will it be until software wallets like Coinomi and Jaxx begin to support Segwit transactions?

Where I'm from there's always at least one toothpaste on special any time I need to buy, so I'd never need to buy full price. Then I can use my current purchasing power on Bitcoin instead of a stockpile of toothpaste.

May I ask why you have been interested in Bitcoin for so long without investing?

The Y axis has 26 rows labeled A-Z. The X axis has 6 columns referring to the words 1-6 on of the key. Each of these columns has 4 sub columns referring to the first four letters of each word. Dots are scribed at the coordinate for each letter in a word. The first word in the key is AGREE, so a dot is scribed in in column 1 row A, column 2, row G, column 3 row R... And so on.  the key BIP39 mnemonics mean all words in the code are uniquely identifiable by their first four letters so you do not need to record the whole word.

Exactly. No one is selling BTG yet
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:50:29
That's a fair argument I hadn't really considered. In my mind continual forking is Bitcoin's biggest risk because it dilutes users down into too many groups and could destroy confidence in the system. But I see logic in your reasoning too.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:58:23
Always wondered why bitcoin doesn't get much attention on We've got volatility in spades over here
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:20:38
I'm no expert but that seems like a reasonable assumption. Real words are easier to remember

The risk even bigger regulation is fracturing. Segwit2x is coming up and many people supporting it still don't think it goes far enough which implies future forks. There's a real chance Bitcoin could keep forking and split the community apart. Why would it stop at Segwit2x. If the bitcoin community can't find a common roadmap it could tear itself apart in favour of other coins
