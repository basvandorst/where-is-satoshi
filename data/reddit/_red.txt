Everyone who understands anything about current financial networks, cringes a bit when this topic comes up. 
**10,000 VISA transactions != 10,000 bank settlements.**
You need to understand what your comparing for the numbers to mean anything. 
Yes, Bitcoin should try to improve, BUT from a bank settlement view (which is what you *really* care about), Visa performs several orders of magnitude worse than the numbers bandied around (eg. 10K TPS)
If you are a Visa merchant, you likely get a settlement once every 7-10 days that bundles together all your transactions. So from a settlement perspective you may have 300 individual transactions that your receive as 1 net settlement.
 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:24:09
Well, to be fair I think due to sheer numbers, Visa probably still outperforms BTC in daily settlements, however its certainly nowhere near "10K TPS per second". 
Further, banks are only open 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, and closed holidays. During that time there are zero settlements happening. 
As a user, the ability to receive BTC - even if delayed by a few hours is still a huge improvement over the 5 - 10 day Visa wait. 
Further, for lots of practical uses, the raw TPS of the blockchain is not going to be a hinderance, since off-chain transactions will often occur. In a sense mimicking the Visa model. 
For instance, suppose there is an Ebay-like site that transacts only in BTC. It may well be that the site only does a net settlement once or twice per day per account. 
So if you sell 15 widgets today, you may get 2 transactions that day of 8 widgets and 7 respectively. So this reduces network load from 15 to 2 transactions (an 86% reduction)
Again, I'm not saying that the dev shouldn't look for ways to increase TPS, instead I'm saying that comparing Apple-to-Apple requires a bit more thought.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:58:04
Its not a fair comparison at all. A more accurate comparison would be "what is the average VISA bank settlements per second"? And that number would be lower by several orders of magnitude. 
VISA may only settle up with merchants once every 7 days, which bundles hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single settlement. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:13:01
Exactly, and given that the archaic bank system is only open 8 hours per day - closed weekends and other statist "holy days" - the true TPS bank settlement number is probably very very low. 
Perhaps VisaPRDepartment can post those numbers?

I was speaking of the prices of goods will rise due to increased money supply (ie. standard inference regarding inflation).
Regarding the .5% increase, yes it was not meant to accurately model how new BTC will be distributed, but to illustrate the point that the potential increase is so small that it would be overshadowed by the other bullet points. Hence, for all practical purposes this is a hugely deflationary currency, opposed to the OP initial concern that increased supply was going to lead to price inflation. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:47:45
We agree. 
Open-source is better, the only thing is when you get to hardware is it becomes a much tougher proposition. 
How can Apple "open-source" a chip? Apple is using ARM's technology and Samsung manufacturing. In hardware, there becomes too many players involved to open source it. Multiply this by all the chips on the board and throw in patent lawsuits and you arrive where we are. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:32:54
You have the definition of inflation and deflation exactly backwards. 
More money supply = higher prices. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:13:49
But you are wrong. 
Please read up - a 2 sec google provided [this overview on how their encryption works]( 
relavent bit below: 
     Their approach is to add a 256-bit device-unique secret key called a 
     UID to the mix, and to store that key in hardware where it's hard to 
     extract from the phone. Apple claims that it does not record these keys 
     nor can it access them. On recent devices (with A7 chips), this key and 
     the mixing process are protected within a cryptographic co-processor 
     called the Secure Enclave.
With advent of "Secure Enclave" only the phone has the key. The only thing that Apple could do (or anyone else), is to create a special boot rom to load on the physical device which then tries to brute force the "Secure Enclave" chip into turning over the key. 
However due to the use of CPU / Memory intensive hashing algos (think scrypt), it would take somewhere between .10 sec or more for each brute force attempt. 
The result of this is it would take years (if not more) to successfully brute force the chip into giving up the keys.

Supply and Demand doesn't control the market?
Look at what happens when a company steps out of line....imagine the general uproar if a restaurant was caught refusing service to gays. The company would be forced to apologize and take remedy action immediately. Moreover, the more popular the restaurant, the more outrage would be generated and thus quicker remedy.
Its one thing that is endlessly fascinating. The average statist slob will rant (correctly so) in such a situation, demand boycotts, etc. Almost always the situation is remedied within a day or so....they will loudly proclaim this all to be part of the "evils of capitalism". Meanwhile their own states have killed hundreds of millions of people, literally dropped atom bombs on cities, and the slob will shrug his shoulders and say "what can you do". 
Its as if they subconsciously project all the impotence they feel against the state against their local McDonalds.

Exactly right. 
Moreover, it implies that there is some mythical "unregulated" state that is possible - one that will result in evil companies preying on victims. 
"Unregulated" is not a possible state for any market. All markets are regulated. Clients need to buy for Vendors to sell....and vice-versa. All markets are regulated by default.

Open-source or not, Apple has about $700B reasons to be telling the truth. 
By publishing in their IOS Security Guide that this is how their encryption works, they would become liable if it was later discovered they had lied and really possessed some "super secret key". They would be sued out of existence. 
Its in Apples benefit *to not have the key*. This absolves them from lots of legal liability. 
Moreover, Apple knows their demographic would be pissed if they were caught handing over info to spy agencies. 
Again, this is what the Feds are so pissed about, Apple thumbed their nose at them and said "sorry we can't comply with your request because even we don't have the keys"
*This is the entire point of the lawsuit*.

The Fed is not there to make a profit for itself, its there to make a profit for its shareholders!

But, "winning the fraud suit" is not trivial. This still takes time and human effort to manage. Secondly, its not exactly completely impartial, banks will generally always side with the cardholder - regardless of the evidence. 
To put it in perspective, most industries have a ~1% chargeback rate. However, some industries (online gaming, digital goods, etc) can have as high as 10% chargeback rate - *as the norm*. 
So imagine TruCoin is able to bring their CB rate down to 5% and they manage to do 1000 transactions per day. Thats 50 cases to manage per day. 
Lastly, and this is perhaps the biggest issue, is that CB are not evenly distributed across all transactions. They tend to be "bigger than average" due to their nature. 
So if you successfully process 990 transaction per day for 1 BTC each. But you lost 10 transactions per day due to CB and those average 10BTC each, are you making any money?

I'm all for thinking critically about things - even if it points towards 'conspiracy'. However this fails Occams Razor pretty easily. 
So, we are to believe that Apple spent an extra 50-60M in development cost to include an expensive dedicated crypto chip, and then coupled that with publicly lying throughout their IOS Security guide, all so they could participate in this conspiracy?
If they wanted to participate, why didn't they just do nothing and be like every other cell phone (ie. wide open).

From a strict sense, you are right that the BTC money supply is increasing, therefore presents a slight upwards pressure on prices. 
However, there are several countervailing forces which will prevent that from ever being an issue. 
* First off, we will not hit the 21M mark until 2140 
* Secondly, that only represents a doubling from where we are now. Therefore it only represents a growth rate of .5% per year
* Thirdly, coins which are loss will shrink the supply
* Lastly, demand will far outpace all of the above, which mean that for all intents and purposes it will exhibit lots of deflationary pressure.

I understand the distinction you are making, however I don't think its fair to say anything *is* money. 
Money is an idealized concept: Sort of like a triangle, it exist purely as a concept of which there can be various implementations which satisfy its ideals to some degree or another. 
For many millennium, gold was as close to the ideal of money as possible. I think with the advent of crypto-currencies we have come up with an implementation closer to the ideal.

The chip is in-between storage and CPU.

I was always skeptical of Trezor's advantage over a paper wallet (I'm not looking to get into that debate as I understand the use cases are different). 
However, this reaction from them makes me question their technical skill as well... I mean if they are this "newbie" when the first competitor shows up, it makes me think what else haven't they expected?
They could've spun this soooo much better. Their message should've been:
    "We are happy to see people adopting our platform as it validates the 
     technical and security decisions we've made. As always, we know that 
     our customers first concern is with the safety and integrity of their 
     wallets, which is why we don't feel threatened. This is a big enough 
     market for multiple competitors and we know that our customers see 
     that the Trezor name signifies a commitment to transparency and 
     safety."

Moreover, part of the disingenuous rhetorical strategy is to "compare bitcoin vs VISA"
The problem with that comparison, is a VISA transaction is NOT a bank settlement. 
It may take 7 days from the time you buy your sandwich with a VISA until the vendor's bank account is credited. 
Having a bitcoin transaction, which even if it takes 12 hours to complete, is still a huge improvement. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:07:36
Exactly. Moreover "bitcoins" (which are really just markers for blockchain security) will always inevitably have value, even if you actively *tried not* to make it currency. 
For instance, lets say 5 huge companies all jointly decided to use blockchain technology for some project. Lets suppose they knew it would take millions of dollars in computing power to secure it, so agreed to somehow split the cost. 
They wouldn't be able to design a better system for splitting the cost, then to use bitcoin as the valuation method.

It actually isn't that no one has figured out the credit card thing....its chargebacks that are the problem. 
There is no essential "fixing" this problem, since charge reversal is a fundamental feature of the credit card system. Its why, for instance, many businesses use Amex for large purchases. Because they know that with a phone call they can get my money back regardless of what the merchant policies are.

Nice explanation. 
This is why you can generate new valid addresses even if your bitcoin client isn't connected to the internet. 
To simplify: The address is just a hash of two random points along the elliptical curve of your public key. 
Hence if you posses the basic model of your specific curve (ie. your private key), you can then generate a valid address that will automatically be able to receive transactions without need to "register" them first on the network.

He's delusional (or to be more specific, he's too young to know because he has little real world experience). This is more akin to a private equity deal than a true vetted public market style IPO with audited financials, reps &amp; warranties, underwriters, etc etc.
I was just part of a PE deal for a hospital that has 8 locations. They got a 6.5x multiple....and they made real money (eg. $75M EBIDTA). A smaller competitor sold out last year for a 4x multiple.

Yes, I think this was a legally dangerous move on his part. Certainly most judges would've granted such an injunction as the move completely wiped out a whole swath of creditors for very capricious reasons.
I'm willing to bet this is how it went down: The vast majority of his creditors were sub $300 / 30BTC. However, he had a few major creditors who had large USD holdings. 
Before doing anything, he talked to them and explained the situation and effectively got a no-action commitment if he allowed them to withdraw their USD. 
He's willing to take a chance on the others because he knows no one is going to file suit over a 20BTC account.

Your analysis lacks some perspective:
There was a bitcoin gold rush, you just missed the first part. 
Back in the day (~2010) you could (a) mine with your CPU, and (b) get free bitcoins from the bitcoin faucet (got my first 5 coins that way). 
Just like real life, the easy-to-get gold gets picked up quickly....and then it becomes increasingly costly to mine it. 
Furthermore, there was never really a time when gold was comparatively easy to find....in order to get to all that easy gold in California, they first had to build ships, sail across the atlantic, and then travel across the continent. Hardly an easy way to get it.
Gold gathering ability and technological advancement have always been in an arms race not unlike the 'difficulty' setting of bitcoin. 
Lastly, you could well be in the middle of one of the greatest bitcoin gold rushes right now -- but you just don't realize it. In 20 years, you could be telling your kids "in 2012 I had the opportunity to buy BTC for $10 each!"

I don't necessarily disagree with your points, but to use linux as an analogy (which I think is entirely apropos). 
The Medium / Long-Term developments will not be about bitcoin per se...in that no one will really think much about it....same way consumers aren't gushing about linux because their phone runs it...or the website they bought their movie tickets uses it...its all just infrastructure at this point. 
Most likely is that the bitcoin network will branch off into dozens of other directions. Some large companies will probably get involved with running their own BTC networks - some with slight variations on the explicit tech, but overall adhering to the general principles. All of this will be well hidden to the public...no one will know about RIPE hashes or Merkel trees. 
There will be lots of competition in this space and instead of government currencies being replaced by some hugely popular single alternative, they will be swamped by thousands of hyper-specialized currencies. 
The need for a "single currency" is intrinsically tied to a specific phase of human technological progress. When everything is networked and computing power is ubiquitous, there is no need for a majority currency - since exchanges will exist to transparently handle all possible use cases. 
So, Apple will have their own iTunes currency. And yes, you will be able to buy physical apples at the grocery with them....Kroger will automatically buy/sell iTunes Bucks for Associated Grocer Credits on worldwide markets. Likewise, apple growers will demand payment in AgriCoin so Kroger will buy/sell those on an as needed basis in the same process to prepare for their next order.
All of this will be transparent and seem ordinary to the consumer. No more complicated than currently your decision to pay your bill with Visa or Amex. You won't have to bother for what the price of bananas in AgriCoin is...since all prices will be presented to you in the currency of your choice. You will intellectual know these other currencies exist and may occasionally dabble in them (everyone will think its good to have at least 5% of your net worth in AgriCoin, just in case). But, by and large you will choose to spend the majority of your time pricing things in iTunes credits or ProGoldPlus or whatever....
This consumer choice, will largely keep these currencies honest....and news of companies debasing their currencies will be spread fast around the internet with people dumping them instantly on exchanges. The punishment will be so severe that companies will become exceedingly vigilant about being honest in this regard....particularly after the big event in 2040 when Walmart was totally bankrupted in 3 days after reports of their currency manipulation was made public. 
In the end, people will look back at these times and ask: Grandpa, you guys *knew* the governments was manipulating your money....why did you guys go along? How could people be so stupid to think such an idea could work?

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big believer in gold (and maybe even more so silver). I own both. 
It would be great if we could free ourselves from the grip of the pervasive central banks and politicians. And yes, taxes are theft plain and simple. 
My point above was simply to point out that we've all been implanted with this idea of "intrinsic value" and the more you look at it, the more you see this concept is a subtle yet powerful way they keep control. 
For if they can convince us that somethings are "inherently" more beneficial than others, then that becomes the basis for them to do all their voodoo economics (and bailout their friends along the way). 
Yes, I think a 10 acre plot of crops has more value than some shares of google stock....but its not inherently so, its only because of my personal subjective belief. If I owned 10M acres of cropland I may prefer to get some google stock, rather than add another measly 10 acres to my holdings....

The core of Keynesian belief is that employment, wages, investment, and interest rates can be centrally managed. 
This itself is imposing "values" on the market. So, instead of allowing natural corrections to occur, they deem those outcomes as "unfavorable" and therefore engage in all sorts of market distortions to coerce people into other behavior (ie. pull interest rates down to nothing to "encourage" spending and investments, etc). 
Of course, politicians, are naturally interested in any and all ideas that give them more power, so they are natural champions of these ideas since it ultimately puts all economic control into the states hands. 
If Keynes wasn't actually born, he would've had to be invented under a different name. The Fed after all was founded in 1913, so it was only a matter of until these philosophies were fostered to give academic and political cover to the monopoly owners of US currency.

For instance could it describe that Party A has purchased wallet public ID: 12345 for $25.00 USD?

If you look at the provided chart, you will notice two large plateaus at approx 12 and 16. 
Inside these two plateaus, things slope downwards until they meet at the clearing price (ie. the price where things are actually being bought and sold) 
Obviously there are no real open bid/ask at the exact clearing price, since those 'open orders' quickly become 'filled orders'. 
So what this chart generally tells you is that the vast majority of sales are happening between 14.5 and 15. But there have been some sales outside of that (hence the gradual sloping)...but there is a real resistance band at 12 and 16 respectively, as there is suddenly much resistance to executed trades happening above/below that.
@_date: 2011-06-27 19:29:10
The problem with these arguments is the question: intrinsic value. 
The notion that things have some "intrinsic value" is a fallacy that has plagued economics for the past 100 years (put forward by Keynesians who we have to thank for our whole ponzi-scheme economy). 
In reality, all value is subjective, because humans are the ones assigning the prices and we ourselves are inherently subjective. A glass of water is worth one price to you and a very different price to someone dying in the desert. 
Even if gold has industrial uses, doesn't then confer any magical "intrinsic value".

The fundamental difference here is that these "electricity cost" you are talking about are really miners earning money. You are choosing to look at it strictly as a cost, when its really just one side of the profit margin calculation.  
People are only doing this because the 50BTC they earn for mining offsets any and all electricity cost. Moreover, if the price of bitcoin drops significantly people will stop mining so the "total cost" will drop. 
In short, there is no "cost" per se in the bitcoin system, since people are only doing this because they are earning money. 
With regards to to transaction fees, I have no doubt many schemes will be tried. But in the end - given competition - the transaction fee will hover very close to the actual electricity cost of processing a transaction. Right now, that cost is about .8% - which is still many times cheaper than you can get by using Visa / MC / etc.

By devaluing the currency you effectively give everyone a stealth pay-cut, thus bringing the cost of labor back in-line with its value and preventing unemployment from increasing dramatically.
That is a very unique (and immoral) view of being an advocate for liberty. 
By the way, calling yourself a "libertarian" and having never read Rothbard, von Mises, or Hayek is a bit like calling yourself a computer expert that has only heard of Win95.....

I can believe such collusion happens in something as heavily regulated as food production. There is a dearth of suppliers, and a very high regulatory hurdle that prevents new entry to the market, so its only natural. 
You really need to look at the absence of collusion in 'true free markets' to apply to bitcoin. What is the price of porn on the internet? Although there is massive demand, why has it become essentially free?

Well, the network tries to keep blocks being created at 6 per hour (every 10min) regardless of what the coin creation rules are....
On a tangental, but related, discussion is how free transactions will eventually be crowded out in such a scenario. 
Currently, the maximum transaction size of block is set to 1MB, of which no more than something like 50k can be 'free transactions'. 
1MB at current averages would represent something like 3000 transactions total transactions per block (18,000 per hour), of which no more than about 16 "free transactions" will be permitted per block (96 per hour). 
Obviously as bitcoin creation slows, miners will move into transaction fee mining (and many may reject all free transactions to maximize revenue). 
I'm willing to bet that even though new coin creation will no longer be 50 BTC per block, that those inherent economics will persist, but with the balance coming from transactions fees. 
So @ 3000 transactions per block, that implies that the average transaction fee may eventually stabilize into being something like .016 BTC. 
The whole transaction fee scenario is something newbies generally forget when they get in their long debates about the profitability of buying mining gear. I'm in no way taking a side on that issue, just pointing out that that current mining rig may likely be earning money in the future as a transaction processing rig.

I share your sense that bitcoins may be a worthwhile speculative investment. However, I would add that in addition to accumulating BTC....you also need to agree to spend some as part of your investment.
What I mean is, in order for BTC to really take off, we need a vibrant marketplace - therefore instead of just buying say $100 USD worth of BTC, instead buy $110 USD and sit on $100 and spend the other $10.

You are right that Friedman wasn't really a true advocate for "free markets" (nor really liberty) - which was a grave flaw in him. 
Its sorta to be expected, since UoChi is primarily a Federal Reserve-run university. 
He could never truly bring himself to see the world without central banks, monetary policy (ie. theft via inflation), etc. 
Moreover, his first real job was during the war working for the Treasury Dept in which he came up with the idea taking tax money directly from your check monthly - instead of relying on you to pay them a lump sum at the end of the year....so, you have him to thank for that little "efficiency gain".

Yes, an interesting history of this was the Carr v Carr case in 1800's in UK. 
That case established, when you deposited money with the bank, that the bank was responsible only for the 'general liability', not the 'specific coin'. 
Meaning, prior to that - deposits were protected by 'bailment laws' (the same laws that govern things like storage facilities). The *specific* gold coins you deposited were considered your property and the bankers job was to warehouse and safeguard your property. 
After the Carr v Carr case, this opened the door for modern fractional reserve banking, since depositors essentially just became creditors to the bank. 
This is an interesting factoid that I often point out to the uninitiated, the reason why your bank statement says "Credit" as the term for your account balance is because they mean that literally. You have loaned them money, which they have already spent. Hopefully they will be solvent when you ask for it back.

Its all quite comical actually, because their reluctance in supporting bitcoin is because they don't want to upset their corporate benefactors. However, had they accepted the thousands of BTC offered to them over the years, they wouldn't even need those corporate donors.

Your premise contains a faulty assumption. The central banks set interest rates, therefore an inflationary event from excess liquidity cannot happen. 
Remember that ultimately setting the interest rate is the primary mechanism that CB's use to control money creation / destruction. 
As people start to flee fiat, they will respond by raising interest rates...maybe even up to 30 - 50% (in the 1980's Volker pushed it up to 18% for a year or so). This will accomplish 2 things: 
* will soak up massive amounts of liquidity (ie money will disappear into the CB's balance sheet), and
* will make that currency an attractive place to park cash. 
Further, high interest times are great for Grandma, because she will be earning 25% per year from her corner bank's savings account. 
A nice side effect of this is it will essentially collapse the size of government by perhaps 10x. They will be reduced to essential services only as the debt payments will be too much.

I used the term "broker" somewhat colloquially - it typically refers to stocks. 
Legally, what you need is a known as a "Money Transmitters" license and they can be quite expensive depending on where you are (like posting a $1M bond with the state to get a license). However, some states are much more reasonable, you will have to check. 
A lower cost alternative would be for you to act as an agent for someone like coinbase or bitpay (sounds like what you want to do is more bitpay anyway). 
So, approach bitpay and say "hey, I think I can get lots of customers signed up, is there some way I can earn some fee in the process?"

Immaterial, because it misses the larger point. 
Its not about looking at *specific transaction* and identifying what is Change and what is Destination. Its about seeing a chain of thousands of transactions and knowing the same person made all. 
Again, imagine you have shopped with bitcoin for 25 years - building a list of 100,000 transactions. When you go to pay for your doctors visit, do you want him to then being able to see all 100,000 previous transactions you have made?
This suggestion is like someone saying, "why don't we all put our thumbprints on our paper money before we spend it?" - ummm, no.

Crazy idea, but have you thought about selling blank "Gyft" cards complete with mag stripe that user could program at home? 
Obviously you could partner with someone to sell the mag stripe writer...those are pretty cheap these days...$15 or so.  
This would massively reduce resistance among potential retailers since it would still be "swipe at register"  
For your users, they would simply download a small file from your website that had the encoding information and run a little app that transfers to mag writer and then swipe their card to program.  
Could be interesting, probably open you up to massive more VC funding also by just having said technology.

Broker is a better word, but yes I suppose there is an escrow like quality to managing the float. 
My guess would be is that CoinBase is just doing a combination of (a) buying on other exchanges when necessary and (b) brokering their own clients buys/sells.

I think your calc is off (40K not 400K), but I agree with your point. 
Regardless of what the final number is, I think bitcoin (or some competing crypto currency) is going to bring about the most massive redistribution of wealth that the world has seen thus far. 
I don't know the timescale - could be 5 years, could be 100 - but those early adopters are going to make incredible returns.

You can use  to decrypt and put in WIF format so you can import. 
For security measures, after you load the website disconnect from the internet, do your decryption and then close out your browser before you reconnect. (this site will run in offline mode and has all the javascript it needs to do decryption already downloaded)
There has been no problems reported with bitaddress - but I'm just offering you the standard 'be safe' advice. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:13:20
Why is that?
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:34:57
Sure, but given the exponential monetization that happening, that 20K USD may just get you a candy bar. 
My point is that a real long-term view (say 10 - 50 years) leaves out fiat completely, since its hard to imagine *why* it would even matter. 
The rise of bitcoin, as a concept, is a direct by-product of the corruption and totalitarian nature of the fiat system. More interestingly though, is that as bitcoin continues to rise it will in turn put pressure on the fiat system to become ever more corrupt. We are locked into a positive feedback cycle. 
In the end, relative wealth will not be how many pieces of paper Janet Yellen prints you for your 1 BTC, because those will literally have no value. The measure of how wealthy you are will be how many BTC do you have in relation to other people who also hold BTC. 
My back-of-the-napkin estimate of 60M was meant to be ultra-conservative - as if bitcoin became as popular as something like Justin Bieber downloads and merchandise. 
If bitcoin breaks through, where a sizable portion of the world population used it regularly (say 1B people), that would give something as mundane as 2 BTC some incredible purchasing power (like private jet purchasing power).

Did the fake website ever launch? Who do you theorize leaked the emails?
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:55:36
The full implication of bitcoin is not that it reaches 40 or 1M USD each. 
The real implication of bitcoin is that it will replace the existing financial system - and along with it will permanently remove the concept of nation-states from the human psyche. 
Obviously, I'm not talking about 5 years here....but this is the redistribution of wealth that I'm talking about. 
A thousand years in the future people will look back and see the very large brush strokes of humanity groping forward: Breaking free of the church, breaking down aristocratic rule, development of the printing press and internet, and the formation of decentralized currency will appear on that list. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:58:53
I'm not missing your point. But you are assuming that USD will always exist and have a value, and thats not the case.

Yes, a kind of NAT for the blockchain. Additionally, such a widespread initiative would have the benefit of helping to practically fully anonymize the blockchain.

Hi btc-student.
I would love to send you several bitcoins so you can play with in order to write your paper. 
However, unfortunately my bitcoins are locked by miners right now. If you can please forward me a few bitcoin (2 is fine), so that I can use to pay this fee, then I will be able to unlock and send you 15 BTC so that you may complete your studies. 
God bless,

Have you tried this? [
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:59:45
Oh, I fully agree. 
Back in the day, it was important that everyone had the full blockchain, because we were all adding to the strength of the network - certifying transaction blocks. 
However, those days are long long long gone. The only people who are "helping to decentralize" the network *are* the miners, therefore the whole argument misses the point. The growth of the blockchain will not affect miners, but they are the only people that matter. 
Random Joe Blow BitCoin-QT guy running on his Dell is doing nothing to help 'decentralize' the network now. He might as well save a few GB and use Multibit (or whatever).

Thanks for the clarification. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:21:55
Yes, I agree fully about Mike. 
I believe he's been a big boon to the community. I just think he is strangely naive - either that or I misjudge his strategy. 
At times, its almost like he doesn't understand that no matter what concessions are made to the power structure vis a via 'regulating bitcoin', it will never be enough. 
He seems to operate from a space of "we can just all get along", and its not clear that he recognizes that in the end this will winner take all. 
Or perhaps he is just doing a "lets get our nose under the tent" strategy - hoping to buy time to gain critical mass...
I think from 0 to a 4B market cap is proof enough that existing strategy is working just fine. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:38:33
Yes, but because they are essentially random its difficult correlate that in a provable way. 
Imagine you were looking through the blockchain (with the knowledge that change always comes back to a static address). Look at the following two sets of transactions and see if you can guess the "change" address. 
1. Input: abc Output 1: 63e Output 2: 9ff 
2. Input: def Output 1: 49a Output 2: 9ff
Compare and contrast to this:
1. Input: abc Output 1: 9ff Output 2: c37 
2. Input: def Output 1: 49a Output 2: 7d3
In the second case, which one is the change and which is the destination? (considering its not always the 2nd output, you have no idea).

Second to the excellent points you make, governments must wisely choose their battles. Biting off more they can chew is one of their worst fears because it can lead to drastic loss of confidence across the board. 
For example, the collapse of the soviet union happen in just this sort of way. The population suddenly woke up one day and collectively realized that it was all just a shell game. The government was too broke and too impotent to act on any of its threats....boom no more government within a matter of weeks. 
As it relates to BTC, I fully think they will tightly regulate the USD-BTC interaction points, but will largely leave the BTC-BTC transactions alone. Which, interestingly, will help force the creation of a BTC-only economy. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:13:04
Yes, further most of civilizations large scale infrastructure was built with deflationary currency (gold / silver) almost precisely because it solves most budgetary issues  
Once you raise the initial capital, you usually have enough to carry you through the entire process. 
Compare and contrast this to how it works in a post 1971 world where projections are always off by 3 times too little. 
It's very difficult near impossible to do large scale projects with inflationary money.  
@_date: 2013-03-31 20:14:28
Doing what you propose would severely limit the pseudo-anonimity. 
It would become trivial to track transactions, since ultimately every transaction would have a commonality to tie them altogether.

@_date: 2013-04-20 02:02:38
Good analogy. 
If I had to bet, I think they will let runaway inflation be their solution: (a) Its the easiest, and (b) There is a built-in escape plan for the banks: Ditch the USD, and move to IMF World Currency.

Given a 100 year view is almost mathematically certain that (a) the USD will not exist, and that (b) Bitcoin will exist in some form (although likely there will be lots of competition). 
The fact is almost no gov controlled currency has survived for more than 150 years or so....all gov currencies eventually disappear. 
Secondly, in essence bitcoin is just math - specifically large prime number factorization. It also happens to be quantum resistant thanks to its use of Elliptical Curve....Further its not a product or a company...as long as 2 people exist that agree to use the protocol then its still has value. 
Therefore given a long enough time scale, its easy to predict this outcome.

Once you integrate with bitpay, they will instantly convert any bitcoin you receive to whatever national currency you, so there is no risk. Its effectively the same as taking donations via credit card.

I've looked at it from a different way. How many BTC will you need to be "rich"? 
Currently, M2 money supply is about $10T - and assume there are probably 600M active daily USD users. This means that on average the distribution of USD to Users is about $16,000 each. 
I would consider someone wealthy if they had over $3M USD - so this means you would have to posses approx 180x more than the average person. 
Applying this same metric to BTC, and assuming all 21M are in circulation amongst an active user base of 1M users, which gives us an average distribution of 21 BTC per user - therefore a user that holds 3,780 BTC (21 x 180) would be considered wealthy.
(Yes, its all speculative)
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:03:53
Asking such questions by relating price of BTC in USD/EUR/CNY etc is actually the wrong way to look at it. 
For one, eventually a large portion of BTC commerce won't involve fiat at all, it will be BTC-to-BTC. Therefore its really just all about purchasing power - not the nominal exchange rate. 
A much better way is to look at what distribution constitutes "rich". For instance:
* Right now there are approx 16T USD in existence.
* Right now the 'daily users' of USD is about 600M (Figure 350M US citizens, plus reserve currency trades, plus other nations who are directly pegged to USD). 
* Therefore, thats a per-capita distribution of about 26K per user. 
* Currently about 3,000,000 is 'well off' (not entirely rich per se, but you won't need to work the daily grind). 
* That means that 'well off' or moderately rich is about 100x average distribution. 
So, what does that mean regarding BTC?
* Its sensible to assume that eventually there will be 60M daily users (thats less than 1% of the worlds population). 
* Therefore that will be an average distribution of .3 BTC per person. 
* Finally, that implies that about 30BTC will be considered "well off - to rich".

One helpful way to think of it (not a perfect, but reasonable analolgy), is imagine the way ATM worked is you had to take *all* of the money out of your bank account each time you used it. 
So, want to withdraw $20 to go buy lunch? Well you would need to take all the cash out and then redeposit the extra again


No, change address are created on the fly and are transparent to your use. Remember Wallets own Addresses (which there can be many). So all Addresses under your Wallet are owned by you. 
So from your point of view, the actual addresses are bit of a technicality that you don't really need to worry about. Your private key secures your Wallet and all addresses in it.
