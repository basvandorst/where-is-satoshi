Well, some of the time it's because our immigration process is a labyrinthine nightmare.

Sure, I'm at fault if I try to defraud an insurance company (assuming that my policy doesn't cover theft of an unlocked vehicle or something like that). That's not the same action, though. The thief is still at fault for the theft. And if I were to proceed to *not* attempt insurance fraud I'd be at fault for nothing. 
"Negligence" only applied when you have some sort of duty. If I was borrowing your car I might have an implied duty to prevent it from being stolen, and you could rightly be upset at me if you found out I stored the keys on the roof so foolishly. But I don't have a duty to look after my *own* happiness and security. You can't owe a duty to yourself.

That's not how fault works. The agent who behaves immorally is "at fault". That's the hacker here. If I leave my car keys on the roof and my car gets stolen I was *stupid*. But I wasn't *at fault*. It's still the thief's fault.

Two graphics cards consume twice as much electricity as one graphics card.

Each GPU consumes a certain proportion of those resources. We're talking about a giant collection of GPUs. You aren't going to run them all off of one CPU. You're going to run X GPUs per CPU. And each GPU is "responsible" for 1/X of the electricity consumed by your CPUs. And each GPU is responsible for a certain fraction of the electricity consumed by your air conditioner, while we're at it.

That's in case they go up there and discover you tore off all the wallpaper or something. It gives them the ability to charge you for damage that you caused. That's the idea at least. And, tbh, it doesn't sound totally unreasonable.

Doing whatever you want to your body is a human right and any law saying otherwise is evil and disgusting.

If anything, using Linux probably makes you more of a target. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that every known Linux user is on some "elevated scrutiny" list or whatever somewhere.

I mean... all executive orders sound kind of imperious. They are, after all, *orders*. There's a lot to find at fault with this, but focusing on the *tone* seems strange.
