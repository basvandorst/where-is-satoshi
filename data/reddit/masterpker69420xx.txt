Yes, it's Tai Lopez. KNAAAWWWWWLEDGE. All we are missing is a nice Lambo in the background.. Cmon Tai..

One of the cringiest things I've ever watched. Couldn't watch more than 30 seconds. No in depth conversation at all.. just a bunch of Tai shilling the alt that 'coincidentally' appears on the necklace of his butt buddy to his right. Who's paying these jokers?

its not about the investment for monetary gain, it's about the investment in KNOWLEDGE.

i think it's important to know that the gold you buy on markets is just basically digital as well. It requires a huge amount to be able to redeem shares of gold for it's physical counterpart.

OP is trying to slander Bitcoin in hopes people will believe him and switch to Bcash.

Is this someone from r/btc trying to troll? 
"bcore" lol.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:51:42
ok and?
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:10:49
No, use your regular "Receive" address for whatever wallet you would like them to send to.
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:44:09
r/btc getting desperate as their bcash altcoin plummets, stop trying to cause fear over here
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:28:28
Funny how you have exact statistics for bcash yet you ask this question about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:11:36

you're right bitcoin has no use... no need to bank the billions of people who are unbanked and enhance payment systems globally.. man.. bitcoin is USELESS... what a waste of time. I'm going to buy gold because i know rappers will always need it for their grillz.. thanks WindHero.

Glad to hear you agree about Golem, what do you think about Sia? A long way to go to prove reliable? A good risk?
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:04:14
See you on the top bud, glad i didnt get caught in the hype, throwing my first ever $1k if i see it hit around 1700, then I'll just have to decide what to diversify it into. Got some things on my mind already.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:09:40
Bittrex. Look into exchanges.

A good idea better developed by Golem perhaps?
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:07:49
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:41:58
Yeah, good thinking. I'll get her coinbase and stuff set up tomorrow. The trouble is getting her to diversify her investment in other cryptos. She won't do the necessary research and I don't necessarily want to be the holder of the burden if something I tell her to diversify into folds.

club goin up on a tuesday then either way im in
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:23:55
It's still not BAD news, regardless.

Imagine trying to explain BIP148 to my mom hahahaha, better just leave that topic out.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:16:29
I think I'll be able to talk her into it after she saw me do it and gain some small gains in such a short time. I'll be able to convince her that there may not be a dip and even if we get in before one, we can be confident it will go back up.
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:29:33
I think I watch the market enough to let her know when a good time to buy in will be though, so I can push her to make a good decision hopefully :)
@_date: 2017-06-03 05:45:57
Of course, and I think any investment is and we both realize that.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:11:21
Hey thanks, exactly what I was looking for. I don't hold my BTC in Coinbase, but I do in a wallet that claims "to give 100% control/decision making in the event of a split", however, I also kind of assumed Coinbase would make the logical decision if I were to have BTC in my coinbase wallet. Am I wrong for assuming that?
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:45:47
Right, and my point was my mom saw and it made her realize what I'm talking about isn't some short term gamble like she initially thought.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:01:59
false, tons of them have bitcoin specifically listed in the job description,
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:34:39
Just read them before you linked, thanks though. Makes a lot of sense. Always had an eerie feeling about coinbase, not that I don't trust them, but I could easily see it going south.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:30:55
So do I tell her to buy now?
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:44:45
Cheap in relation to the recent activity of BTC these past 2 weeks is what she means. If we continue to see this sideway trend, I will urge her to get in (or if it drops of course). But I will also make her get in before the next parabolic phase, hopefully.
