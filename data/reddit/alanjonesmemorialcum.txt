Bitcoin refers to all digital currencies though, that's the definition of bitcoin.
One bitcoin has chosen to call itself Bitcoin (or the Bitcoin), but that doesn't take away the actual meaning of the term bitcoin. It's right in the word! BIT COIN.

Then why do we just do what banks do.
@_date: 2014-01-22 09:44:30
Ha-ha! Good one!
No Banks are why the people love Bitcoin - the banks are their own un-doing.

Which bitcoin are you thinking of investing in? Bitcoin is probably the most well-known one but they're expensive. Dogecoin is another option - you will be able to buy many more than if you invested in Bitcoin, but dogecoin is generally considered a Joke.

I was using bitcoin to refer to many cryptocurrencies at once.

It's all good friend, Linux is inherently a more secure-system for bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-22 09:19:53
The same thing though...equals centralisation in one entity!
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:26:02
Deny it all you like but facts are facts. It's people like you who have held the financial revolution back for decades. 
Welcome to Bitcoin, friend :)
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:44:47
No thanks, I use bitcoin to Be my Own Bank. I like Decentralisation of the protocol - that ensures the systems integrity.
Why should we trust your enterprise?

No need for belligerency, Friend.
When you consider the many Advantages of bitcoin, you can understand just why its' imminent global Hegemony is near!
Thanks friends

This community has been far more Accepting and you should be - not everyone once knew what you knew.
@_date: 2014-01-22 05:27:58
You can give us a First Hand account in a few years! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:58:34
I don't believe you. Who even are you?
@_date: 2014-01-22 06:42:22
Unbelievably, some Smart People refuse to switch to bitcoin - possibly because they aren't able to understand the Protocol, but also possibly because they are afraid of change.
They will be the ones left behind though, as the world continues to turn and Bitcoin spreads over Globally.
Thanking you :)

I am just trying to clarify a controversial point in bitcoin - your belligerence in not appreciated by the community.
@_date: 2014-01-22 05:33:20
Soon we will all just be able to use bitocoin, then a few years after that, we will Only be able to use bitcioin.
Many thanks.

It's not ambiguous at all. If I say dollar, it's obvious what I'm talking about, as is US Dollar. This is not a new thing, please pay attention.
@_date: 2014-01-22 09:51:29
What's the point in decentralising something which is designed to be Centralized though? Seems like one way in which a bank has the Advantageous upper-hand though?
@_date: 2014-01-22 07:16:47
Can you ELI5 Double Spend-Prevention please? Why do we just do what the banks do? You can't Double-Spend a coin.
@_date: 2014-01-22 08:08:06
So it's centralised in one blockchain?
@_date: 2014-01-22 07:53:23
I think you'll find, however, that the blockchain is all the transactional integrity One requires :)
@_date: 2014-01-22 07:04:09
Easy. Bitcoin was first, so it's only fair that people use bitcoin.
Dogecoin is just a bad Joke which is scamming people of their hard earned Dollars. When time will tell, Bitcoin will adsorb dogecoin users (and uses - for a quick fix at least).
You see, Bitcoin has exceeded expectations and soon, Dollars will just be Locked Out.
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:20:59
Why don't banks just switch to one of the bitcoins then? Bitcoin, or maybe dogecoin or Litecoin?
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:58:10
They are all bit coins though. Like Dollars vs US dollars/Australian dollars, etc.
