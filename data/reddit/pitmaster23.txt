Nice. Just a suggestion :
Always wait for at least 4-5 confirmations.

Posting this for the 3rd time for Mods attention.
I am copying from one of my earlier posts : 
**Request to mods.**
Being a coin Lover / hodler, I love this community. But lately, as we are growing, sub is being filled with all sorts of posts. I think it's about time we some flairs so that one can find what he/she needs and also the valuable contributions to the sub will remain surfaced (or at least easy to find.) 
I can already think of some if it helps :
(requesting fellow members to comment / suggest, so that this gets noticed)
**[ATH]** : for all the lovely memes/ posts we do after every kilo gain. [Technical] : for all the technical discussions (at times related to chain / forks)
**[General]** : for newbies / senior members to discuss the notion of BITCOIN as a concept
**[Bit-Economy]** : for when Post is related to Bitcoin as asset

Tax is always profitable for governments. 
They have to pull on ways so that citizens can spend coins in India itself.

Can any of you bitches answer me, if a set up a node, then am i helping in saving segwit legacy and saying NO to 2x?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:49:05
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:36:10
Quick questions:
* Is me using ledger nano with segwit in anyway helping the cause?
* Can I transfer from legacy to segwit addresses?
 
* Can I identify from wallet address to which chain it belongs?
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:40:01

Love the post and optimism. 
Am also a coiner.
But given the extent of study that I did, I think rate of growth wont be liner or constant with time. In a way, its not good for any asset if it's here to stay.
you're welcome to correct me.

@_date: 2017-10-21 05:53:03
I agree with you partially with the pumping point you made and there needs to be something.
In the regular asset markets, we have same thing going on even with the SEC and in general, there will always be ways to do asset manipulation as far as there is some sort of centralization. For BTC, only thing helping us is more adoption.
Thanks for your thoughts.
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:12:11

My question too. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 07:58:49
* Primarily, if you take a look around 70's when it actually took off, Gold had so many downfalls.
* after 2000 it pretty much proved to be a good asset for a decade.  
* Current decade seems very unstable though.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:16:02
Then Do I do it or not?
