Haven't listened to this show yet, but Bitcoin was also mentioned last time they had the Merlin Project guys on.  They released a Timetrak of Bitcoin on their website. They were very bullish.

Theoretically there must be a point where if the price drops far enough, Bitpay loses value as a company.  I would think that the leadership's fiduciary duty would be to make adjustments to protect their company's value.

Responsibility vs incentive is an important distinction that I failed to make in the OP.

I'm referring more to the overall value of the Bitcoin ecosystem shrinking because the price has dropped too far. This is just a thought experiment - I don't think we've established a direct link between the price and the 'value' of Bitcoin.
I don't think it's a given to assume that we will see even growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem forever.  If Bitpay's growth outpaces the rest of Bitcoin's growth we could see the situation I describe.
Their profit is directly tied to how many people are spending Bitcoin. If a lot of users dump Bitcoin because they have decided "the party is over" (price has dropped far enough) then their value as a company also declines.
Their business is not directly tied to the price but it may be indirectly tied to it.

I will be tipping the EFF for all their hard work.

A free HUD software would be a nice feature.

Since Voat is open source perhaps it can be forklifted to Maidsafe/Ethereum/etc when they are fully baked.

Why did I read those comments...

Any plans to decentralize the platform itself?

Not a Bitcoin economist, but I speculate that the exchange rate will rise as miners will have to sell at a higher price to offset their expenses.

I don't know why you think owning BTC (I do) qualifies one to make comp-sci evaluations that can affect huge financial ecosystems. As Szabo said: less politics, more comp sci.
(FWIW my meaningless opinion is to implement a fluctuating scalable blocksize to avoid future hard forks)

Are there investment opportunities for BTC holders?

Please explain - I'm out of the loop.

Really enjoying this service - thank you! Is there any way to link directly to a notepad (like  It would make it really handy to be able to create a browser shortcut to a specific notepad. Also would love a checkbox that can toggle 'auto-save' in case of browser crashes.

I don't think it wouldn't be visible due to https... the bookmark would expose the password but that's up to the user to protect their endpoint and people don't have to use the feature.

Would love to see direct linking to passphrases as a feature.

It will probably be a bit like Linux. Used heavily in very niche markets but may take 30 years to become widespread.

It would probably be easier to get off the ground using the same concept and apply it to IT help (software troubleshooting, tutorials, malware removal, up to higher level sysadmin tasks). I guess like a Bitcoin-based Mechanical Turk.

You have designed a casino where betting is allowed on the price of bitcoin and deposits are also only in bitcoin.

Changetip is Bitcoin's Killer App IMO.

If this had Nearfield Communication (NFC) it would be unstoppable. Tap two fobs together to complete a transaction.

The question is, will they deactivate your inactive account once your balance reaches 0.  It seems wise anyway to move any BTC to another wallet if you aren't actively trading.
Simple solution - execute your trades and withdraw your BTC.

Sounds like a great replacement for Libertybit!  I'm going to sign up.
