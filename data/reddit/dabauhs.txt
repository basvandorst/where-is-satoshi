Actually, receipt of stolen funds when the origin of those funds are likely stolen carries the same penalty as initially stealing them.
Of course it requires you to not make an attempt to return the funds to the original owner in order to be found guilty.

There is a built-in checksum to protect against mistyping an address.  The chances of the mistyped  address being validated are so slim that it will most likely never happen to anyone ever.

You can't "Purchase" btc with a credit card via Coinbase as far as I know.  It is only a backup funding source in the event that the ACH bounces.  If the ACH bounces, it is my understanding that you would receive an NSF fee.  Repeating this behavior would most likely end in an cancelled Coinbase account.
None of this is verified, just my understanding of how it works.  However, I have looked specifically for ways to purchase using my CC as a funding source on Coinbase and was unsuccessful.

Each time another 2016 blocks are found the difficulty is adjusted automatically.  The lucky miner that finds the 2016th block determines the difficulty that would have been needed for the previous 2016 blocks to have taken exactly 10 minutes per block and then writes that new 'target' into the block for the next 2016 blocks to follow.
The truth is that we are averaging far more than a block every 10 minutes, so in truth we will end up mining the last block far before the year 2140.

Matt, great job at the end there with the comparison to USD being used for drugs etc.  However, any and all references to coin validation are bad for bitcoin.
Coin validation attempts to accomplish one thing, and that is to ruin the fungibility of bitcoin.  Every bitcoin has to be worth the exact same thing as every other bitcoin.  Otherwise it is worthless as a currency.

It's 100% due to the fact that BTCChina switched to a Maker/Taker trading model that pays traders a fee to place limit orders and charges them a fee to place market orders.

I love the certainty of your statement.  It's blissfully ignorant, yet supremely confident in it's ineptitude.
Isn't it just pesky how truth sometimes gets in the way of your crusade?  Bitpay allows the merchant to simply select the percentage of bitcoin vs. USD they want to receive.  The simple truth is that bitcoin isn't ready for complete merchant conversion.  Merchants have to pay for their consumables in USD. Until that loop is actually closed, they will need a convenient way to receive at least a percentage of fiat.
You can't simply WILL bitcoin into mainstream adoption.  It's a process that we are still in the early stages of.

Bitcoin is both a payment network (like Paypal/Mastercard) and a currency like (like USD/EUR).  Generally, the network is referred to with a capital 'B' and the currency is referred to with a lower case 'b'.
Basically, the payment network (Bitcoin) is a distributed (everyone has a copy) public ledger that tracks that trading of ownership/value in a peer to peer fashion.  The peer to peer nature of bitcoin makes it censorship resistant as there is no one point of failure or central authority.  Transactions are completely public but individual identities are 'hidden' as only each individuals public address is publicized (making it pseudonymous). 
The currency (bitcoin) is the first application to be utilized on top of the Bitcoin network.  It is also what is used to reward people for providing computer power to verify and record transactions on the Bitcoin network (these people are called miners).  The currency will have a total of 21 quadrillion units called Satoshi's (named after the anonymous creator of Bitcoin).  100,000,000 Satoshi's are commonly referred to as 1 bitcoin (of which there will only be 21 million).  It is impossible to counterfeit a bitcoin and bitcoins can be transmitted anywhere in the world instantly for little to no fee.

I've made a purchase and thought I'd pass along my thoughts...
1) I tried the Coinbase API integration and it was just too creepy to give you the ability to spend from my Coinbase account without my authorization. I've since revoked the app api access and will be trying out your invoice method.  As a consumer, I would have expected it to work more like Paypal where a login portal is displayed that lets you authorize the payment.  Granting you anytime access to spend coin from my account isn't going to sit well with anyone.
2) Again, the item price isn't working correctly on TigerDirect at least.
3) The order was placed in about 20 minutes... That seems unsustainable but great while it lasts.
4) Your order process is actually easier than going through with the website shopping cart cc/paypal payment process.  It's much easier to just snap the item and not give the site all my personal details.
In short, I love your product so far, but you need to look into the portal coinbase login concept like Papal uses.

Mining is a self correcting market.  The network won't collapse as once a few miners stop mining, it becomes profitable again keeping the others in the game.  
Realistically however, the pre-order game that we are all playing will cause miners to purchase vastly more equipment than they could possibly be profitable with.  By the time the equipment arrives they will have already lost the possibility of recouping their investment.  They will however mine with them to recoup as much as they can.  In other words, even though they are losing money, they will continue to mine.  
Not until 28nm chips start losing the battle to electricity costs will you see people turn off their mining equipment (and that is a long ways off).

That is many years away.  The original algorithm puts it at the year 2140 though with the exponential increase in mining power we are actually going to get there much earlier.
If bitcoin is still around in 70-80 years, it will be so large, handling so many transactions that the transaction fees will be sufficient incentive.  You have to remember that the network is self adjusting... if incentives drop and miners stop mining, then it becomes more profitable for the remaining miners. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:48:50
It's already been said, but all bitcoins won't be mined until sometime after the year 2100.  It's supposed to be 2140 but with the exponential rise in hash power, we keep mining more than one block every 10 minutes.
As time goes on and the bitcoin network ends up handling more transactions per second, then the fees will become a larger part of the incentive to miners, eventually replacing the block reward all together.

Initially, the room will fill with mice and snakes as the room has food (that they want) and only they can find their way in as their small body size permits their entry.
Eventually, the opening is enlarged and other types of animals find their way in. These new animals will of course find their selves vastly out numbered and treated as a curiosity to the rest of the snakes and mice that have been there for a while.
Once the room fills with various animals and the entrance is yet widened again, the process will continue until the new comers are no longer a curiosity.

You were in a tough spot, being on a panel with others that are completely clueless about the subject matter.  You handled it well considering the limited time.
Why is it that every time someone in the media talks about bitcoin and has obviously not done their homework, they think they are making a salient point by bringing up the volatility... How the hell could you bootstrap a decentralized global currency from 0 - 7 trillion (wishful thinking) without volatility?
Speculation drives adoption, adoption drives acceptance.  Without the speculative aspect, nobody would hold bitcoin. If nobody held bitcoin, there would be no point in accepting it as a currency.  This is an entirely predictable and necessary stage we are in not some gotcha media point as to why bitcoin is somehow deficient.

The PBOC has slipped that they don't want the price of bitcoin to go over ~3000 CNY (~480USD).  Each time it nears that level, they release some FUD to drive the price down.
They seem to be worried that if the price runs again, bitcoin will gain more ground with their citizens.  They understand that they can't 'stop' bitcoin, but they definately can stifle the rate of adoption by making it seem less desirable to speculators.

If you think you are actually preventing drug use or terrorist attacks by regulating bitcoin you are simply wrong.
Bitcoin is GLOBAL and the world exists outside of New York.  If I were a terrorist "mastermind" and I wanted to get money to my terrorist buddies sitting in New York, I would simply buy bitcoin at an unregulated exchange or locally from an individual and send it to them where they would then sell it locally for cash.

I don't use multibit, but if it is a deterministic wallet, then the change address that your funds were sent to is 100% recoverable.  The issue sounds like the client software simply isn't looking forward enough in the address tree and doesn't see the address holding your funds.
As I am not familiar with multibit, I won't be able to help you with the settings in showing addresses further out but I'm sure their tech support (once they decide to help) can.

Create the wallet using your livecd, write down the seed, generate the master public key and then shut down.  As long as you have accurately written down the seed, you can recover your private keys at any time.
You can install a read-only wallet on your normal OS and import the public keys using the master public key.  You can then use as many addresses as you need (you shouldn't re-use addresses) and you will always be safe as long as you have the seed saved.  I would recommend saving it in multiple secure locations.

This just came to me, but you could obfuscate it sufficiently yourself.  Take the word list and paste it into Excel or Google Spreadsheet.
Next to the column of words, in the top cell type =rand() to generate a random number.  Fill that column down through the end of the wordlist and then sort the list based on the random column.
You now have a randomized wordlist.  Save that list somewhere safe and then write down the row numbers of each word.  As long as you don't store the wordlist and the numbers in the same location you should be sufficiently safe.

Even if there is no fee, as long as the sender didn't use an output &lt; .001 then the miners will most likely include it fairly quickly.  Merchant's not using a payment processor should not only verify that the transaction has been widely propagated, but that it was also valid and not going to be ignored by miners.

Great video, I especially like how it doesn't pretend bitcoin are actually sent (and travel) over the blockchain. It was a fairly easy to understand explanation of how transactions are signed.
I also like the concept of a hardware wallet that uses smart cards as a storage medium. It's like having an unlimited number of hardware wallets that allow you to have a nice balance between physical and digital security.

A wallet is mechanism for storing private keys.  If you have a private key, software can determine the public key. 
What I meant was that you should setup an offline wallet of some kind... Paper, cold Electrum etc. and then transfer your bitcoin there so that nobody else but you can spend your bitcoin.  Leaving it on the coinbase website just exposes you to risk.

IMO it has nothing to do with transaction fees and everything to do with adoption.  By limiting block size to 1MB we are effectively capping the number of new users that can enter the system.  Their business model I'm sure depends on adoption to increase to many times the current user base.
On that same point, the price of bitcoin is completely dependent on speculation.  If we cap the potential growth of the bitcoin protocol, there will be a significant drop in price.

Welcome fellow bitcoiner!
One thing you really should understand, being new is that the bitcoins aren't stored in your wallet.  The bitcoins are just entries in a global ledger.  Your wallet stores your public and private keys and keeps track of all of the unspent outputs to present you with a current balance.  
With the private key, the wallet allows you to 'spend' the coins (transfer value on the ledger to another public key).  That is why it is so important that you backup your private keys... Without them, you won't be able to spend the bitcoins.
Great quick overview:

Each investor has different acceptable levels of risk.  Having said that I'll relay my experience to see if it sounds more palatable to your investing style.
Rather than invest X% monthly, I decided to leverage my investment by taking out a Discover Personal loan where the monthly payment was the amount I was willing to spend each month.  For me it was $500/month which gave me a $20,000 personal loan.  My thought being that I was willing to gamble that amount monthly in the event that my investment tanked.
I chose this path as prices were low (in May @ around $118/btc ) and I wanted my investment to take advantage of the low prices.  I correctly assumed that the price of bitcoin was going to increase.
Because of some lucky investments in Activemining, labcoin and Asicminer, I was able to pay off the loan in 2 months with 33% of my portfolio.  Now I'm completely debt free and loving watching my investment grow each day.  Long story short, had I taken your method I would only have the amount I was able to purchase each month.

The new bitcoinj feature was discussed on lets talk bitcoin Episode 15.  
The transaction ends up being written to the block-chain.  But instead of each 'payment' being a transaction, many payments between two parties end up being 2 bitcoin transactions.  One to initiate, the other to finalize.  
Think in terms of agreements like, I agree to pay the D.O.T. .001 btc per mile for the privilege of driving in the fast lane.  Then each mile, road side monitors record an off-chain addition to the overall total.  Then at the agree'd upon time/amount the 'transaction' is completed and written to the block-chain. This wouldn't be used for single micro-payments.

The receiving addresses are your public addresses, if you want to see your private keys you can use the dumpprivkey command from the console:

It's very difficult in a situation like that to decide how technical to be.  I think she would have had ended up with a better understanding if you had given a tad more technical information.
Example, when asked about mining:  Miners verify transactions and store them in a global ledger called the block-chain. For this service they are rewarded bitcoins at a pre-determined and controlled rate.  It is this computing power provided by the mining community that secures bitcoin and ensures it's accuracy and continued value.

The Post-IPO price wasn't moving for two reasons.  Lack of news as chips weren't set to be ready for another month and the fact that an additional 2 million shares were set to be released at an unknown amount.  Nobody wanted to buy above IPO for fear of getting caught with their pants down.

Three easy steps to remain sufficiently anonymous:
1) Use Tor (protects associating your IP)
2) Use a different address for every transaction or use the "Shared Send" feature of blockchain.info
3) Don't publish your public address anywhere.  Nobody will tip you anyway.

The only mining equipment I'd consider purchasing at the moment is one of the KnC offerings and $1000 isn't currently enough to get one.  I'd take the money and invest in AMC/Active mining stock and hold long term.  Assuming you want a shot at higher returns and have a high risk tolerance.

Just purely speculation, but I'm wondering if the timing isn't a little suspect.  I'm thinking that coinbase was the mysterious 14k coin buyer this week that started the rebound.
If they continue to buy large quantities whenever the price gets low they will always make a decent profit and will have enough room to cover the occasional loss from fraud.

*1) Instant low cost payments, anywhere any time to any one. (to borrow a line from Trace Mayer) The reality of this doesn't really sink in until you start using it.  I paid a friend my portion of dinner last night in bitcoin in about 5 seconds.  He could have been on the other side of the world for all the bitcoin network cared.
2) Assets can't be frozen
3) Nobody can control who you send money to.  This includes artisans in Nigeria etc. (not just illegal transactions)
4) If desired, nobody can know who you send money to.
5) As a Consumer, it removes the risk of identity theft.  No storing Credit Card numbers etc.
6) As a vendor, Bitcoin has huge advantages.  
  a) No charge backs
  b) No fraud
  c) No need to know or trust your customer at all
  d) Low fees (much lower than CC). Amazon for example could literally double their profit per item by using Bitcoin over CC.
  e) Makes setting up an e-commerce site trivial and monetarily risk free.

$500,000 moves on a thin exchange cause huge price swings.  They seem to happen all the time.  
Historically a large purchase/increase is usually quickly followed by another, causing the price to move $5-10$.  Unfortunately the opposite is true as well, once someone decides to sell, it's generally followed by one or more additional large sells.

Sorry if others already mentioned this but I haven't read all of the replies.
If you are recently logged into Mt.Gox (read currently valid Cookie) and then browse a forum that isn't properly protecting user content, then you were most likely hit by a XSS script that uploaded your valid cookie to a server.
Once the attacker has your current cookie, he can log in and do anything he likes without worrying about 2 factor auth etc.
Something like %80 of web based exploits are due to attacks of this nature.
One idea is to download VMware player (free) and create a VM that you use to do all of your forum/browsing etc.  This way you don't have to have a separate computer yet you are completely insulated from an attack on the VM.

I'm throwing in my 2c as a few of the comments re: paper wallets aren't totally clear...
If your coins are currently on a paper wallet, you will eventually use the importprivkey function (most likely on the bitcoin-qt client) to import your funds.  At that point, the funds exist in your wallet on the same public address as was printed on your paper wallet.  Once you perform your first transaction with that wallet, the 'change' is sent to the first available unused address in your wallet pool (100 addresses pre-loaded in your wallet).  At that moment, your old paper wallet is empty.
You now have a few choices:
* Send the remaining funds to the old paper wallet public address, effectively re-using the old paper wallet.
* Send the remaining funds to a new paper wallet. (this is the preferred method as the old one is no longer as secure having been seen on the network)
* Leave the funds in your wallet and use them as usual.  This has a large risk as the wallet.dat could be stolen by malware on your computer.
Generally people end up losing coins when they (incorrectly) assume that the importing of the private key and subsequent sending of coins leaves the change on the original paper wallet.  They then delete the wallet.dat and lose all of their coins.

I don't want to get drawn into an argument but I do want to try and clear up what might otherwise be mistaken by your comment.
Miners verify transactions and add blocks to the block-chain.  They also validate blocks that other miners complete.  They very much contribute to the bitcoin network and don't just perform the function of adding new coins.

You aren't thinking very creatively.
