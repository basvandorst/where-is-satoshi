Nice it seems pretty legit, from your experience can you really withdraw and deposit US dollars with verification of only Name, phone number, date of birth, home address?? I know some exchanges say that but then surprise you with a mandatory ID verification when time to withdraw, thank you
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:00:56
What are verification tier levels please

How’s your experience with them? I’m trying to research but it seems they are fairly new to the US.

Basically how do you buy ultra cheap altcoins that are under 1 satoshi because exchange minimum price on btc is 1 satoshi instead of fraction of a satoshi 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:22:51
Um thats why you buy the alts?? Like i did

But GDAX uses the same limits as Coinbase .....
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:14:59
I will, but only going to borrow ad much ad I can easily replace if I loose it all, like 6 grand

Who needs math when you have coins
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:46:30
Fuck you, and I guess I want the cash right away but Ill be able to get the 6 K to invest in two and half months 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:12:22
I want to do this to invest all of it now, as you can see alot of the coins are going  up pretty quickly I guess I do feel like I’ll miss out if I don’t get all the money now instead of investing monthly 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:44:34
Wow, cant believe its that simple to make that much money
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:59:02
It’s not that hard by researching on the internet, you can filter out most of the coins with some consistent research.

anyone can say their opinion that’s what I want, but if you insult me expect to be insulted back 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:12:44
Like $50, Ive invested sine two weeks ago only $750 in, I don’t have anymore money until next week, might get a small loan
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:30:50
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:49:23
But you say bitcoin has already bursts but that doesn’t even matter because if those people would of just hodl their coins they would be making a huge profits right now

You are a bot and cannot respond, therefore don’t respond.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:37:57
Yes that is true and yes those bad things MIGHT happen, the difference here I guess is the possibility.... what if that doesn’t happen, what if I actually do make a good profit , the difference Is the opportunity that is presented to me is right here right now
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:11:21
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:25:32
Yes that is worst case scenario scenario but then again I might get a one way ticket to the moon ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:17:22
That was exactly what I was thinking about, people get loans all the time for 5+ years for new cars that depreciate instantly and no one bats an eye, me getting a small loan for 2-3 years to invest and everyone loses their shit , why thouugh.

Response on Reddit was under 10 secs, checkmate.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:01:06
Where you get that, I want one
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:08:36
Why not though? People get loans all the time to buy dumb things , I’m getting one to invest and possibly make alot more.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:34:36
Or success story
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:13:28
Why not though, what is your reason? you might just get it all make and more by investing it
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:09:40
Maybe Ill be able to in one year
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:24:21
I am currently in a position to lose 10k without it effecting me much at all, I might be able to pay the whole 10k in a year and 6 months
