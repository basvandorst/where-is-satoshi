Roger Ver has a tiny knob by the look of it.
Or is a tiny knob.

I use a Trezor hardware wallet.  Store the recovery seed in a couple of places.  Use a passphrase - essentially a 25th word.  I give myself a hint to it with my recovery seed - after all, if someone has stolen my recovery seed I'm already in trouble, but even with the hint it will buy me some time (it would actually take about 6 months to crack my passphrase, even with the hint!)
I also have a couple of 256 bit ultra secure USBs in two locations.  They have a password hint option too - but get it wrong and they self wipe after 6 attempts.  They are made by Integral, for a few quid from Amazon.

So get a cheap phone with a SIM card.  Problem solved.

She goes up and down?  Crikey, that's a bonus.  Normally hookers just lie there motionless like an American girl.

Well, I use the hardware wallet to carry out secure transactions.  But I agree that if you are a hodler there isn't much point.  I used to be a hodler, but recently went into panic mode - just as intended by Dodger Ver and his shitcoin - I'm back to hodling tho. - it is complete bollocks in the cryptoworld!

Eh?  That doesn't even scan you fuckwit  :)

It is a very risky market - if we knew the answer to this, we would all be rich - but of course that is impossible!
Personally, I stay in the cryptomarket and move capital around cautiously.
I've been forced to diversify recently, mainly due to the mess that BCH's confusion has thrust upon the market.
I hold a basic stock of BTC, as it is still the prime store, but take a look at Bitcoin price equivalents, BPE's.  You will find some surprises like ZCash, and to some extent the slightly tarnished Monero.  You may need to buy some shitcoin BCH to cover yourself.  Good luck.  p.s. I am still 70k up on the year - but would be doing better if Ver and his sock puppets hadn't messed up the market.
Look out for further implementation of the LN.  It may put these shillers back under their nasty rocks.

Oh yes.  Because the word is already an unusual one, and only pending status in proper dictionaries.
And to add insult to injury, it was misspelt.
So you have a dodgy word, that is also misspelt.
Any more questions?

Buy a cheap phone?   Doh!  Call me Captain Obvious.
p.s. do you have a car?  If not you can take your horse and cart to a mobile phone shop.

p.s. I don't use gold to buy a coffee.  That would be silly.

I think there are 15% capital gains taxes if you cash in for fiat. 
I don't think there are currently any regs about simply holding - after all, no-one really knows what this stuff is worth! :)

Are you Dr Craig Satamoshi-Wankeromi?  You appear to be thick enough.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:15:01
It's just not enough though, is it?  
Not that it really matters.  
Serious investors in crypto go to BTC, not Shitcoin Cash.  
But it would be good if BTC could get its act together.

You are quoting the word 'majoritively.'  I don't see that word above.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:13:45
His mate, Dr Craig Hakamoshi-wankeradoo actually invented the knob.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:02:24
Oh, and I'm REALLY sorry if this is off topic.
What I'd like to know is what is ON topic.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:57:07
Is majoratively a new word?
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:08:59
Actually, my Mom was the first mathematician to point out that 2 is an even prime number.  
Dr Craig Satamoshiwanker (whose degree is in theology) and his friend, Dodger Verging sur Cunt have discovered a new one: 67,002.
It is being integrated into the Shitcoin Cash algorithms as we speak.

I would tidy up your grammar and syntax before questioning the intelligence of others.

Anything with Ver in the background has an odour.  I put some money into the apparently excellent ZCash - and it turns out Ver is in with that project too.  A bloody cancer on the face of crypto.

Oh fuck off, you boring wanker.

p.s. I have reminders of password hints stored widely in my Google account and MSoft and on my computer - to remind me what I have done.  This is a low security document - only useful if you have my recovery seed as well.  I also have a high security version, including the hints AND the entire 24 word recovery seed - but that document is only stored on the two secure USBs.
The only money I hold on my laptop is 1.6 GBYTE coins.
