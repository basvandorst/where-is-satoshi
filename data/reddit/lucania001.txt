Brilliant work guys and congrats getting BTCpay set up. You are most likely still working on the site but just a quick heads up
You still have staging links on the site 
Navigation is broken/missing for me
Otherwise looking good and good luck

Cash is always accessible? This is just as brain dead as some of the other statements in the thread

This is awesome. Would 100% use you if you were more local to me.

Will take a look, any better than wirex?

Still one of the most ridiculous things I’ve heard being parroted about. I can’t remember it saying credit card in the white paper?

Thanks man just download on iOS via TestFlight, can you fire over a few cents to try and I’ll send some back.

You can use electrum to pay bitpay. Annoys me that so many services I use I can only pay with bitpay , but at least I’m transacting with bitcoin

A quick google will show you countless tales of people sending money to the wrong bank account. It happens, human error will always be a thing.
As for banking cartel , I’m not sure if they’ve made their mind up yet. They seem to be deciding if they can control it, live with it or attempt to kill it. I actually think it’s more robust than you think, it might not sustain a high price but I always believe the network will be sustained as a means to transfer value.
So back to the watch and wait stage I guess... either way excited to see how this all pans out

Block size increase. End of really 
L2 and L2 will come but for now we need block size

We can fit 1tb on a micro sd now. Plus internet connections within 10 years will go through exponential growth due to people like Tesla/space x offering there satellite mesh broadband.
Honestly I see 2mb now as a minimum to see us into the next generation of bitcoin as a currency

When my mortgage provider starts to accept bitcoin.
Hopefully by then price is good enough I can pay it off without having to go back through fiat conversion
