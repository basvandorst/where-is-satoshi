Jim's original vision was for it to work like cash--Not like coins.

Totally fair comment. I don't like to participate usually, but some of the shit Ver says just gets my blood boiling lol. There is definitely some truth in what you're saying though. Same shit that was going on with the last election.

I agreed with everything until "you don't need to greatly change true supply and demand". Either the speculators make up a part of the demand or they don't. If speculators think the value will hit 100k and it does, then that's not really a bubble, right? If speculators pump up the price and then all sell, leaving the underlying demand for bitcoins in tact at a much lower price. Then, yes, that would be evidence that a bubble existed. Seems very hard to predict before it actually bursts though, no?

So you're saying bitcoin is going to keep going up at this absurd rate we've seen over the last year? Damn, can't wait to be a trillionaire!
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:06:37
I'm positive people won't confuse the two. lol you foreal with that? Ver must be writin paychecks today, you guys got the shill squad out in full force.

Roger Ver is quickly becoming the Donald Trump/LaVar Ball of bitcoin. He just does dumb shit that gets enough publicity for him to benefit from it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:59:55
No problem. I think we're on the same page here. We're throwing around scam artist like Ver believes he's scamming people. I don't think that's the case, I do think he *believes* he's on the right side. It's more about the methods he's employing, which has led to all the outrage. He bought r/btc and is very active in social marketing (aka shilling), or at least that's what it seems like to me. I could totally be wrong here, there's definitely been an ongoing campaign to tarnish his reputation from the other side too -- typical 2017 politics, you know the drill.

An unbiased person would've said why bigger blocks are better is what I'm guessing.

Okay... but bitcoin is so young. The point I was making is that once the crypto market is fully saturated (yes, there will be multiple bubbles and crashes on the way there), the price will become much more stable. It will appreciate in value as a deflationary currency which could cause people to hoard as we have already seen. So, maybe it's not the best national currency. That doesn't mean it can't still be an incredibly viable new currency because it's so easy to exchange, holds a good store of value (presuming this holds into the future) and serves as a unit of account. It is the *internet of money*, it's going to serve a distinct purpose. People thinking it will entirely replace the dollar are most likely misguided imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:53:20
Sounds like my kind of place, actually. Small talk culture here is annoying as hell. You envy GDP but if you think cryptocurrencies are in a bubble, watch out. Quantitative easing and years of near-zero interest rates are about to catch up to us real quick. Huge crash incoming next year more than likely. Probably going to hit everywhere though, unfortunately. Not a sustainable system.

It was the prevailing market price. People don't only look for houses in a 10 square mile area. If the price starts plummeting in one area, it could potentially be contained as new buyers move in. If multiple areas start dropping in price, no area will be unaffected because there's no new buyers to move in.

Ahh Denmark? Nice. How is it over there? Looking to relocate soon, obviously this place is goin to shit. Although I am trying to get away from the cold weather.

Right, the only reason there's is such an astronomically high investment potential is precisely because of how unstable it is at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:40:46
I agree with all of your points there, considering that housing units aren't really fungible compared to a bitcoin. But I also think you're underestimating the impact of the increased demand from people trying to flip or invest in real estate for profit. They didn't want 4 or 5 houses to live in, so that over production of houses definitely triggered a down stream devaluation of all the other houses as banks just tried to move foreclosed houses at whatever price they could sell them for. That is going to have a huge impact on most areas.

He wanted to scale bitcoin too fast so that people could buy coffees and other small transactions, making it easier to use his shitty website. Others feel that giving up the security and potential for centralization is the wrong way to go about it. It's not that he forked his own coin, it's that he's now calling his bull shit fork coin the "real bitcoin" and is calling ours "bitcoin core" and "bitcoin legacy". He freaks the fuck out when we call it bcash, yet constantly disrespects the bitcoin name and misleads people into buying his coin that he has to keep pumping with his own money to stay at an even somewhat respectable price level.

Up 1500% primarily because of grants, and an endless supply of 18 year olds getting however much loaned to them that they want. Just wait until every high school student isn't pressured into taking 80k in loans, while the jobs disappear. You'll see how fast those tuition prices drop, how many schools will close altogether. The price is that high cause we've convinced naive kids it's worth that much. supply and demand people. *That's* a bubble too.

Look up what happened with Mt. Gox. I can't say I have a particular link but I'd type in "Roger Ver Mt. Gox" and get the full details on that debacle if you're unaware. I wasn't in BTC at the time so I can't really attest to experiencing it at the time. Hopefully someone with more info could chime in here.

Bitcoin Cash Classic Gold Diamond Platinum Uranium Token is my idea for the next fork. One coin to rule them all!
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:51:03
well then I guess it's a good thing I can "use" it to send small increments of money almost anywhere in the world.

Someone crying at the thought of ridding the world of wars?? As he's on the way to making a billion dollars? Idk man that kind of screams scam artist. Just look into his history and you'll get the full picture.

That's fine, it's a muddy issue I'm not trying to convince you to hate him. Was just explaining why most people do, myself included.

Does anyone know if coinbase pegged BCH to BTC? It looks like the exchange rate between the two has stayed pretty much constant this whole time...
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:01:42
Lol except that's already the name for one of the proposed forks, although I'm not exactly sure what's different about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:17:24

If him running around presenting his own own coin as the real bitcoin and making no clarifications on his website doesn't do it for ya, then I'm not sure what will. What do you want to hear, that he's murdering bitcoiners or something? It's not like its that extreme, he's just a dick.

I enjoyed your little story and got something out of it. Thanks for posting, my one buddy keeps pressuring me to get in on these penny stock altcoins but stories like yours are what has stopped me.

How do you know exactly which news is influencing the price? Both are FUD campaigns that are nothing new to the people have been around for a while. Are you saying the market is reacting to the  actions already taken by China (banning ICOs, crypto-exchanges) or  because of the threat of a future ban of bitcoin altogether? 
Also: what do you mean "it's time to just bail out"?? Why?

Is there a software wallet that can store Bitcoin and Ethereum? Should I not get a software wallet, it sounds easier? I have like $3k combined value so not sure what to do with this fork looming. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:31:47
Does anyone use breadwallet or know of a better wallet on your phone, or why I should/shouldn't use one of these. Very confused about this whole Aug 1st thing.
