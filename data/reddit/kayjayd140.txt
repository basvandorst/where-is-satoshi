IF tether released an audit, it would do wonders for consumer confidence and BTC price would skyrocket IMO. Just sayin..

This reminds me of a time when 30% dips were like an inside joke to this sub... now every dip is headline news. We don’t need the media, we’ll moon on our own.

@_date: 2018-01-16 12:23:47
Lol new account ... but very observant of you
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:32:34
Lol no bitterness.. this is just a really bad attempt at fud. You need more detail, something believable. 
Someone posted during last months crash that He heard Coinbase was facing insolvency. Had details and everything, that was good. This is just really bad.
