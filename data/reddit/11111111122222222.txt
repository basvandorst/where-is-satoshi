Not $200k but 200,000 btc

It’s a Chinese ponzi liquidating 210k bitcoins. 
They have been selling blocks of 50 and 100 Btc for a few weeks.

I have a question. 
Just bought my first hardware wallet and am still adding to my stack. 
In terms of transferring new coins bought on an exchange to cold storage. Does anyone think it makes a difference how I route those coins. 
1). From exchange transfer to hardware wallet
 
2).  From exchange to hot wallet to hardware wallet. 
Do either of these two options make more sense from a security perspective? Or does it just equate to more fees?

Bitcoin has in the past dropped around 40%, three to four times in each bull run. 
Welcome. This ain’t a straight line up.
Also no one knows shit about short term price movements. If you did you would be a literal billionaire in short order.

Because they are incredibly paranoid, they see some hidden hand behind everything. 
The world has gotten too complex to be understood and they have retreated into the idea that a hidden force (nefarious secret cabal) controls it. 
If they don’t understand it, it is must be aligned against them. They are victims.

How do you know this. 
All you have done is assert this. What is the mechanism that pumps bitcoin? The way this would happen is if they are minting tether to pump bitcoin but so far this hasn’t been shown. Not to say it isn’t happening. But I haven’t seen evidence yet. 
Another interpretation is that, without access to large scale banking these exchanges have had to create a work around. In order to move money between themselves (balancing) and holding large scale deposits and they did that by minting a token. 
I would be very surprised if tether was backed even 50% by reserves. 
I have seen this play out before, online poker sites operating in the US after the UIGEA had a very hard time finding banking support, complicated by operating in a legal grey zone. 
The biggest risk to the exchanges is securing non shady/mainstream banking services.

I know a number of people who bought at 15k+ last time around and who have been bag holding waiting for it to rebound. 
Many of them will jump to sell if they can end up square. 
It just seems like there might be a lot of selling pressure if we break 15 at any point.
