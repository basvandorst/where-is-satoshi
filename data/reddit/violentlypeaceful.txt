but I guess it's still cheaper to deposit and withdraw CAD directly on Canadian Exchanges. I was looking for a good alternative where I don't lose so much on fees, and even if I can open an USD account in a Canadian bank, they get their own part of the cake when converting this USD to CAD.

I don't even have Bitcoin and I'm willing to help on this. If Bitcoin crashes in value because of the lack of LN then all the cryptocurrency sphere will suffer with it. Bitcoin is the mother of all coins and I want it to be healthy. Count me in.

I wish we stopped spreading these images, they spread a lot of FOMO by encouraging hindsight bias.

Great quote, but people are completely unable to ignore the "drama", that's why it's so efficient. People with weak minds will just answer and start throwing accusations. Always. History of humanity. Won't be different here.

You guys are doing it right!

and how do you cash out this USD as being a Canadian? I've been using Kraken but I'm looking for alternatives.

Because bitcoins can become "tainted" depending on how they were used in the past. There are multiple cases (you may search for these cases on the internet) where Coinbase and other Exchanges will refuse specific bitcoins that were used in illicit deals in the past.
So let's say that someone sent me some Bitcoin and I tried to sell it at Coinbase for $4000. Oh, but this Bitcoin was used in a drug deal so we won't accept it. I might be inclined to sell to someone else for $3700 only because I need the fiat and because maybe no one else will want this Bitcoin.
On the same note, I have one of the first Bitcoins mined by Satoshi himself, which means there are people who will want to pay more than the market value for this coin since it has "special" properties.
This is a concept called fungibility and I recommend looking for it on the internet search engines of the world.

I'm not so sure this will work well in my case. I'm just too much into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.


The answer might be BTC if I ask it too consistently. :-P

Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, you're right.

He's a human being named Satoshi Nakamoto, but he isn't "our" Satoshi Nakamoto.
