I have uploaded a python script that generates graphs comparing the fees of Wasabi Wallet &amp; Samourai Wallet's Whirlpool. 
Regarding whether to scale anonymity set as A^R or A*R.
A = Anon-set per round
R = Rounds participated in
I used A*R, so perhaps I should have used a new term rather than anon-set.

I might have an off by one error which is why it's 1.8% rather than 1.5%
Edit. It actually reads 1.5%
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:51:36
I agree.
A neat feature would be spend threshold warnings;
Users have the option to set a custom spend warning (in BTC of course) so that sending any amount more than say 0.005 gives a pop-up.
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:25:40
Mostly correct, but I think it's 720,000 sats ($76.3) (0.4×100,000,000×(1.8÷100)) (and it's actually 1.5%)
With whirlpool you pay to get into the mix, and then mixing is free.
With wasabi you pay per round, but you have more users per round (currently).
I haven't included mining fees at all yet, I expect that this is to the benefit of whirlpool more than to the benefit of wasabi.
Wasabi has a pool of 0.1 so it only makes 10 UTXO's at the upper limit in this model (1 BTC), in reality it would split it into 0.4,0.4,0.2 I think.
Whirlpool splits your input into multiples of the pool size so for the 0.001 pool a 0.4 BTC input would be split into 400 UTXO'S

Ask the merchant for 100 addresses? 
I joke but this is actually a good solution, it just requires standardisation.
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:15:29
To achieve a 500 anonymity set with wasabi you pay 0.003*500 = 1.5% of the amount you are mixing.
With the UTXO line both lines are on-top of each other so you can't see the wasabi one.

It's by far and away the best mobile bitcoin wallet available.
It has unmatched functionality whilst also being an incredibly simple user experience.
It's a Bitcoin wallet, there is no way to hold fiat in the wallet, so having $XX.XX makes no sense. If you are spending at a merchant the merchant sets the rate, so it adds more confusion having a fiat equivalent.
Imagine you go to buy a $10 T-Shirt, click pay with bitcoin, the site shows a payment request for X BTC, go to send and see that you are sending $10.04 -&gt; wtf what is the $0.04 fee?!? 
The sooner you get familiar with sats/BTC the better

The people of Venezuela are suffering as a result of the failure of fiat currency. The paper is now worthless and lines the streets.
I am truly sorry for the situation in which the people find themselves. With the power out Bitcoin is not a viable solution right now (though it is possible to use Bitcoin without grid power). 
With global bitcoin adoption this situation could be avoided.

Matt Odell (creator of the project) has acknowledged this limitation and suggests that it should be assumed that the service has access to your data, for example a decryption key for an encrypted drive should be provided rather than the seed itself.

I have written an [Bitcoin Seed FAQ]( that I would encourage you to read if this type of thing interests you.
If an attacker knows the first/last 12 words of a 24 word seed the security against a brute force attack is greatly reduced (compared to brute forcing with none of the words known). Importantly it is more than twice as easy to brute force the half known seed (to understand without going into too much detail consider that 2^24 is 4096 times greater than 2^12).
All else being equal you should make it impossible for an attacker to access to any of your seed words.
In reality, all else is often not equal. It is important to consider the relative security of the options available to an individual when discussing bitcoin seed security. 
Take Alice &amp; Bob;
- Alice stores a full copy of her seed (24 words) in location A and a second full copy of her seed (24 words) in location B.
- Bob stores half his seed (12 words) in location A and the other half (12 words) in location B.
If an attacker (Charlie) goes to location A he can easily steal Alice's bitcoin with minimal effort or technical expertise - he simply has to identify that what he has found is a bitcoin seed and use a tool to try different derivation paths for the seed until he finds bitcoin to steal.
For Charlie to steal bob's bitcoin he will have to identify that he has found half a bitcoin wallet and then brute force the remaining 12 words. It is possible that he would be able to brute force Bob's seed given enough time, but it is also possible that the attacked would not be technically competent enough to brute force the seed, or that he wouldn't even realise that he has 12 words of a 24 word seed (perhaps he would assume that it's an invalid 12 word seed).
It would be natural to conclude that Bob's bitcoin seed is more secure than Alice's.
But now consider what would happen if Charlie is an arsonist (not a thief) and he sets location A on fire.
Regardless of how Alice stored her seed (on paper, stamped on metal etc.) she has a full backup in location B - she does not lose her bitcoin.
For Bob, how he stored his seed is now essential. He has no full backups, no redundancy. If the seed in location A is lost then so are all his bitcoin. Even if he stamped his seed into a metal plate it is possible that location A is an old building which collapsed in the fire, and his metal plate is buried under tonnes of brick and iron.
It would be natural to conclude that Alice's bitcoin are more secure then Bob's.
This example was simply meant to highlight that it is easy to forget that there are often trade-offs when it comes to securing your bitcoin seed. Though you should take care to minimise the risks posed by a sophisticated attacker capable of brute forcing half a 24 word seed you should first limit your exposure to risks which are more likely to pose a realistic threat (such as fire / malware / social attacks). 
# Three 2/3 Partial Seed's 
People will suggest using 3 partial seeds, each with 16 words i.e. [1-16] , [9-24] , [17-24 &amp; 1-8]. This does give some redundancy, but as discussed previously the relationship between number of revealed seed words and security against brute force attack is not linear. 
As a simple exercise to compare of relative strength of 24, 12 and 8 unknown bits (0/1) compare the number of combinations possible. 2^24 = 16777216, 2^12 = 4096, 2^8 = 256. 
There are ~ 4000 times fewer combinations of 12 bits than there are 24 bits, and ~65000 times fewer combinations of 8 bits than 24 bits. Other people will be able to crunch the actual numbers for BIP38 seeds, and it may be that the security of this method is still sufficiently high that it is a reasonable approach for almost everyone (excluding those which huge bitcoin holdings).   
This method (splitting seed into three 2/3 pieces) is simple, and does not require evaluation of any additional code (as is required for Shamir's Secret Sharing) but it does significantly lower the security against brute force attacks.
# Shamir's Secret Sharing 
Shamir's secret sharing is (IMO) going to be the best way to minimise brute force risk &amp; redundancy risk, though it will require use of additional software to split and recover the seed which will increase the risk of inputting your seed into malware. Tools are coming out soon which will make using Shamir's Secret Sharing far easier.

Full quote:
"During the manufacturing and production process, these two vital components are generated separately, on different devices located in different geographic locations (different countries and jurisdictions, thousands of miles apart). This data is never transferred electronically, and never copied, duplicated, or backed up onto any other storage device. This also means that our employees will never come into contact with all of the necessary cryptographic key information. Thus the capability of others decrypting or stealing funds from the Ballet physical wallets is eliminated."
All this text does absolutely nothing to add validity to their claim.
They are lying, they cannot guarantee that there is no possibility that someone can steal funds from a ballet wallet.
Do you disagree?
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:12:32
No worries. I'm sure you are aware but you have no redundancy if each person only has one seed in a 2-2 setup.

Screenshots  appear to show that Binance are blocking users who use Wasabi Wallet  from further withdrawals. In this article I explore what reason Binance  my have to distance themselves from users who use Wasabi Wallet.
TL;DR. I speculate why I think that it’s likely that Binance received lots of the scam PlusToken bitcoin that [ErgoBTC](  tracked going into Huobi. This would explain why they are now blocking  of anyone mixing with wasabi (which was known to have been used as part  of the scammers mix process) as they try to publicly distance themselves  from the scam.

Have a look at this site, you can see the fees required to get int the next block quite easily. 
If you can't set the fee with the wallet you are using simply use another wallet. You don't need to send the coins, just restore with a better wallet (like Samourai wallet) which gives you control.

It's all too do with the backlog of transactions, how the wallet estimates fee rate and whether you are using RBF (replace by fee). 
I can't recommend switching wallet enough, with Samourai you can set RBF on for all transactions and then send with a low fee and bump the fee if required at a later time.
