Oh fuck off, I have a business degree from a major University (top 100 in America) and I have a (five-figure) job as an economic research analyst at a major respected firm. I understand how economics and business works. You're a nobody, kid ��
Go back to fiat where you belong ��

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. Its future applications are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of computing and economics most of its possible functions will go over a typical investor’s head. There’s also Sitoshis’s free market outlook, which is deftly woven into his creation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Robert Malthus, for instance.
The shills understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise that it is not just speculation - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in Satoshi’s brilliant programming method - the “Blockchain,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Haber and Stornetta's Merkle trees. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as our lord and savior's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��
Bitcoin &gt; food, normie.

I'm sorry that's just dumb though, go up to a food vendor get a slice of cake eat like half then only pay half? He can't resell that half of the cake.
Just because something can be divided up doesn't mean there is a use case lying in there.
Also with the current transaction fees how feasible is it paying for one page of a book? You'll end up paying more in fees.

But why use bitcoin for this compared to other technologies which are built around making that as simple as possible such as ethereum?
