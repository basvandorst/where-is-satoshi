The assumption I disagree with is "It's a disrupter of the banking system".   It's 300-500B market cap is small, smaller than the largest US corporations.
People keep talking about Bitcoin as if it was as big as the 56 Trillion derivative dollars that burned-up during the Mortgage crisis meltdown in 2008.  Or the 250 Trillion that are at stake today.   Did the US Govt care when that was going on? Under a Republican administration? I think the US Govt has bigger fish to track,  Bitcoin is still a guppy and the concerns expressed are more in my point of view centered on losses that might impact economic upticks, or gains that aren't taxed for Govt revenue.
Am sure the US Govt behind the scenes might be quite happy that they get the potential ability to tax gains created by foreign investments in Bitcoin,  it's a whole new level of tax base as I have no doubt that many of the bigger Bitcoin and derivative stakeholders are US based.   US Generating wealth is a benefit not a determent.

These aren't covered contracts, they are cash settled, the 'bet' happens outside the actual bitcoin market.  Like going to Vegas and betting on the football game.
If you're a fund manager and want to create a crypto fund and minimize the downside risk you're going to go long on bitcoins and want to buy short futures to hedge,  you'll buy them under market at an acceptable risk point.   If the market goes above strike they are worthless and you're out the $$ you paid for the contract.   Bitcoin is the market 'bellweather' if you notice when it drops all cryptos drop.
If you had a substantially large position you could go short and sell at what you think is the peak, and cash in your contracts -- but that's a bit of a one and done play and you don't know whose on the other side of the market to buyback.
I think if anything you'll see more future straddles then anything, banking on the swings of the market.
BTW: Forgot to mention futures contracts are a market in itself,  sellers and buyers,  which can limit the availability and manipulation.

Well, it's not really Bitcoin is it? Blockchain is the 'how it works'.  You have to understand Blockchain to understand the decentralized trust model, as well as the gold-modeled scarcity design of Bitcoin itself.
But, does it really matter? A long time ago, when Apranet was around the only people who used it were the people who really understood it, the internet was the first step in the tech moving to mainstream.  
As technologies go mainstream,  they do so typically because they've obfuscated the technology enough that people no longer have to understand how it works, they only need to know the derived value.   This is a good thing, as it means it's become more consumable to the masses, which solidifies the technology in the market.

GBTC gives access to Bitcoin w/o people having to open accounts, buy Bitcoin, and manage their private keys.  It also makes it accessible in IRAs and 401k (where allowed),  and they get the added liquidity and security of it being accessible directly from their brokerage account.  Don't under-estimate the herd that wants simplicity -- there the ones that are entering the market in hordes right now.   
You may feel the premium over NAV is ridiculous,  but if BTC keeps growing to 50k, 100k that premium will seem very small over time.   It's a supply/demand equation,  and GBTC is increasing rapidly due to that fact.

In the very simplest terms, and an over-simplification, it indicates that the distribution of prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ....) aren't as unpredictable as they seem to be.  If someone could solve for Riemann then we'd have a more clear view into, and potentially the ability to identify primes much faster.
Public key encryption is based on the trivial fact that numbers cannot be factored by an equation.   You only know 21 is 7*3 because you either brute force it or you learned it specifically in school.   I if I take two significantly large prime numbers (like 32 digits each) and multiply them together it will take a long long long long time for a computer to figure out what those two numbers are.

Value of anything is mostly based on perception.   Even Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc... (though Microsoft pays a dividend),  most markets are driven by potential.   And, Bitcoin isn't a company so it's market isn't defined by the same boundaries as an Amazon, Apple, etc.... It's in a market that's an order of magnitude larger.   
I'm not going to disagree that it's not highly speculative and one should throw caution to the wind,  everyone should take their risk seriously and limit their loss exposure.   It could all vaporize tomorrow, true.   But I also believe there's a ton of confirmation bias happening within a small domain of people that are not representative of the 99% of the world that doesn't even know what Bitcoin really is.

This is mostly true, but institutions can, and do have positions in bitcoin -- look at ticker $GBTC,  which I believe has 186,000 bitcoins.
What you are pointing to is these futures are uncovered and cash settled, unlike  futures where the contract is commodity settled.  So the betting happens outside the market with nominal direct impact to the market itself (except for psychological impact based on the volume of short/long contracts).  
What this will provide for is for ETF creation, where bitcoin positions can be taken and hedged accordingly.

I look at it this way -- with futures institutional investors can hedge their positions, which means more institutional investors can offer bitcoin funds with more secure returns.  It's all good in my books :) 
I don't see it driving bitcoin down, I actually see it going up as this paves the way for funds getting SEC approval.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:33:11
Well, they are cash settled futures so there's no obligation to be covered (e.g. long or short on bitcoin itself),  so for someone to manipulate the market they'd have to buy a substantial position and sell with a volume of short contracts.  Which seems risky.
That said, I think we'd see more people straddle with futures due to the large swings, hoping to be 'in the money' over the opposite side of the straddle they paid.  In that case, nobody cares if it goes up or down,  just that it goes up or down enough during the contract period.
I also think funds like GBTC will use them to hedge their positions to thwart large losses.  It'll most likely open the doors for more funds to invest in bitcoin as they can hedge,  which they can't to today which opens them up to a very high risk.

GBTCs accelerant is people wanting in on Bitcoin but not having easy access to the underlying asset w/ the funds they want to use (e.g. IRA, 401k).   And, most people aren't liquid, their money is locked up in their house and retirement savings are a huge slow-growing asset for most.
It's also easier, for 99% of the world who doesn't know or trust GDAX, Gemini, Kraken, Binance, and the 100s of other recently sprouted exchanges to buy directly from their brokerage vs. wire money, buy coins, trade, figure out what to do w/ forks, etc... it's simple for most of us here, but we're in the &lt; 1%.
Also, how many of you have liquidated out of an exchange and wired your money out? It's a pain in the ass.   A big crash and your locked in,  GBTC provides greater liquidity w/o the fear of locked-in.
Premium? I just think about 56 Trillion in derivatives in redundant mortgage insurance, laugh and think... oh man, we're just getting started.  No brokerage cares,  they make money off the transaction and mgmt.

They are cash-settled futures, so they are uncovered.  This is a psychologically driven market.
I've read a lot of cons, but here's my pros:
- Institutions can buy-in and hedge their funds, limiting down side risk  
Net: more money into BTC.
- Drives awareness of BTC and makes it more legitimate as a asset/currency/store of value. 
Net: more money into BTC.
- Someone has to sell a contract for someone to buy a contract.   
Net: Just as many want it to go up as go down,  so for a dumper, there will be a vested interest by a pumper.
- Trader legitimacy: It's not to say anyone should trust the Wall Street crew, but it's an exchange of trusted traders.
Net: if you manipulate the market, a trusted party will get burned,  that's bad business.

But if you lived in a country w/ a very unstable currency,  what is your option to gain stability and not lose your life savings through hyper-inflation, or the govt banning rupee notes, like what happened in India the last year.  The countries central bank? Nope.  The stock market? Nope.  You're screwed.
I'd argue that most stocks are just as much as an illusion,  we base the value on revenue and P/E Ratio -- but it's really a value store,  unless the company pays a dividend.  Amazon at ~1050 isn't profitable, never has been, doesn't pay a dividend, people own it on perceived value and we correlate revenue into that stock value, but tell me what you get from that?  It's truly value based on an equation,  just a perception that more revenue = greater stock value.  The only value I get is other people buying into the same belief of the equation and I can cash-out into more fiat because of that.

What cracks me up is if it doesn’t move 50% a week people get panicky.    Which is a clear indicator of inexperienced investors who probably shouldn’t be putting their money in here to begin with.
Word to the wise,  if you achieve 20% consistently a YEAR throughout your life on your money you’ll be a miracle investor.  What’s happening here with Bitcoin and it’s derivatives is an anomalous event.  Be patient.

The beta value is high enough, why not just straddle and play both sides of the market?

If you want bitcoin to be adopted broadly in the long run, and not be seen as a threat to govt, then paying taxes on your capital gains is most likely worth it.  
Why limit bitcoins upside by forcing it to be scrutinized, banned or over-regulated by side-stepping tax laws?

Did you have any money in Coinbase? Or were you doing it as a withdrawl against your bank account? If it's a withdrawl, it'll confirm the price and say it's a pending transaction until your bank clears the funds.  That can take up to 5 or 6 days.

Program trading, just like on Nasdaq, Dow and S&amp;P the lines diverge but always follow the same patterns.  It means more institutional investors are in on the crypto market.

Transactions can be whole, but if the lot size is larger than the at-market available it will break up the lot across the buyers as they sell at bid.

My interpretation of decentralized may be different then yours. I see decentralized as meaning no dependency on traditional centralized banking systems; a cross-border currency without the pain of fees and variations in fiat values.  A system I can exchange and store currency without the intermediary; fast and painless.
I don't see it as a ploy to not pay taxes.

As someone who invests in a highly diversified portfolio,  my methodology is margin (borrow) as a function of risk.  The higher the beta value, the lower I'm inclined to borrow unless I can stomach the volatility and am highly confident on the upside.   I don't think of interest rate to borrow, it's a non-factor typically.  Unless loan % &gt; expected earn %.  I also cost average down,  rather then all-in.  By .3 of a coin at a time, with some time in-between.   Just realize you'll never time the market accurately.
In your case it's a matter of when the loan is called back,  what if there's a major dip that lasts a few months?  Then you'd owe and lose money.  
But, as they always say, don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Panic? There was a lot of profit taking,  as well as big volume buy-ins at various levels.   Look at the 7 day trend line and the associated volume levels.  Also we're still significantly up over the last 30 days.   Stabilizing and building a solid base at these levels is pretty amazing.  If it sits in this zone for a week or, all the better for the next step-up above $11k.

If the CME and Wall St. can find ways to make money off it,  the chances of regulation, especially under the current US administration is fairly low in the near term.    It seems a few are already diving in.  For example you can buy into GBTC ETFs through some brokerages like Schwab.
If taxes can be properly accounted for, then even lower chances.    
That said, it could happen. And early Investor’s to anything know (or should know) they take the greatest risk with the highest returns for taking that risk, but they could lose it all.

The main concern with GTBC is it's premium over NAV.  Right now the NAV (before tomorrows big pop) is  ~1610 for 1/10th a bitcoin.  In other words you're paying 16K per coin they hold.  This premium is driven by the fact that they are CURRENTLY the only player in the market and everyone is starting to want in on bitcoin for their IRAs, or don't want to transfer large volumes of $$ to a potentially unreliable exchange where they can't easily transfer it out if they cash-out, so they can demand the premium. 
Don't be surprised once CME opens up futures trading on bitcoin that there isn't some type of NAV correction,  either through a NAV drop when bitcoin is increasing in price, or some type of reduced NAV increase % as bitcoin increases, because that will open the doors for other funds to enter into the market.

Without even reading the article I can say absolutely NO.  
Not every millionaire can afford to buy even 1 bitcoin.  Why? Because it's not a matter of net worth it's a matter of liquidity / cash flow.   There are many millionaires that are so because of property or ownership of non-liquid assets.  They don't have cash in the bank,  they are "paper" millionaires.

Easy to do as it's very much a symbiotic model, which is why decentralization is so compelling. 
It'd be interesting / fascinating to create a decentralized loan system where people could opt-in for a fixed or variable rate of return without an intermediary.  It would be complex to pull off, but would definitely change the model of the banking system.  I can see that as something in the future, but only after market stabilization occurs.

It’s a sign of institutional programmatic trading.  Ever watch the stock market?  90% of the time the lines are all following the same patterns across Nasdaq, Dow and S&amp;P...  i actually see it as a good thing.  Because they bounce in a similar pattern.

Super simple,  uses the same login you already have for coinbase.  Just go to gdax.com,  you can then do a deposit from your coinbase account, trade, etc...   For safety reasons I usually put the coins back into the coinbase wallets when I'm done, then to cold storage if I'm hodling for a long period of time.

People are hyping this up, not sure why... seems completely expected. Of course you pay taxes on capital gains once you convert to local fiat. And you should never walk into any investment thinking otherwise.
Am sure Coinbase fought it moreso to protect the privacy of it's users,  rather than skirting tax obligations.

I'm doubtful it will shoot up,  but continual media coverage, mention on BBT and institutional banking exposure all reinforce the Bitcoin brand -- more people will think "I should check this Bitcoin thing out"

Are you using GDAX? Or just Coinbase?  GDAX and Coinbase are the same company,  GDAX is the more sophisticated trading system.  Only market orders have fees and there's no fees for transferring between Coinbase and GDAX.

Not that I've ever looked at the source code myself, but:
base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS] = std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt;(1,0);
looks to be that base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS] is a key/value hash dictionary based on std::map&lt;int, vector&lt;unsigned char&gt;&gt; , so there's most likely a base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS_TEST] mapping to another vector for the TEST.
Vectors have much more flexibility for insertion, deletion, moving, swapping, sorting, etc... ( than using an array (e.g. unsigned char myucarray[1] = { 0 }).  Only issue is that vectors allocate memory non-contiguously so there are some speed differences when traversing.   The '&lt;' and '&gt;' indicate the vector is a C++ template.

Bigger block size adddesses a near term challenge, it’s a quick fix, more of a bandaid then addressing the bigger problem and It’ll run into similar barriers of transaction time and cost.  Hence why lightning network is being developed, it’s about creating transaction efficiency in the network, instead of just increasing a parameter in one line of code.
At least that’s how I’ve interpreted it from what I’ve read.
