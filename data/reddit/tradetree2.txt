You asked a question without all the information on what you are asking. Will you actually get what price? How could anyone answer a question of this format? The length of time is dependent on the mining operation. There is no set time. It may take minutes or days.

Thanks for that example. That calms me down a great deal! It was about half a bitcoin so some money for me. :-)

Update: I learned that you can get stuck and never confirmed. Then I found a great site that kicks unconfirmed transactions: 
In one minute I was confirmed.

It was like $5 or $6 something like that. I used the default for one and "premium" for the second. They both have not cleared. I thought "premium" would go through!

A famous economic event happened a couple hundred years ago in Holland. Some growers figured out how to grow better tulip bulbs. There was a run on the price of these better bulbs, i.e. some hysteria. One unlucky person was the last to pay a high price for the best bulb. Suddenly everyone realized that the value in the bulb was based on emotion rather than rational considerations, and the market collapsed. 
Bitcoin does not have the same properties. You can't create a better bitcoin, only a different cryptocurrency, or a better way to transact the existing bitcoin. It has a fixed amount, unlike growing more tulips. It has more fungibility, in that it can be used as a store of value anywhere in the world, not an expiring tulip. It can't be confiscated (at least easily or practically) by any government.

Interesting. Looks like LTC blocks are under 3 min. while BTC is about 10 min. What I didn't realize is that the 10 min. is only the current block, but you can have a really large set of unconfirmed transactions. I thought something was terribly wrong if I didn't clear in one hour, but in reality I'm sitting at the end of a long line of 200k transactions.

Here is another, but it didn't work for me:

Value is intangible. If you store a painting in your attic it may just gather dust and never be seen. If you discover the painting is a Picasso, it still has no value while in the attic. But you bring it to others who value it, then it is worth something. All forms of fiat currencies lose value over time, but bitcoin does not, not its core intrinsic value. It can have speculation, but unlike a fiat currency there is no printing of more money. Hence it will be treated like a stock because it is the first time in human history when there is both a non-fiat currency and no cost to mining it like gold. It just exists as set of bits that can't be increased. This gives it a very stable inherent value

The basis for buying is still true, so why would you worry? I am thinking of buying 0.5 bitcoin at this price, so I can have 1 full coin. Did I mess up by buying my other 0.5 bitcoin at $2500? It is now worth $8000 so it is all relative. No one can increase the number of bitcoin out there, so supply and demand are in the balance. The tulip analogy doesn't apply because everyone could create new tulips, while they can't create new bitcoins.
