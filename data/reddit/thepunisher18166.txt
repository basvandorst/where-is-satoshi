i bought them very cheaply in 2015 and at the start of 2017 when they were worth very little but i didnt sell ATH in jan 2018. well it s like that. in the doge subreddit they would say anyway 1 doge - 1 doge ahahah

the coins are what i really have. what is not real (at least on today's date lol) is the value in fiat 
@_date: 2019-03-20 23:55:02
I'm sorry. Heard about cryptsy. What a scammer that guy. Luckily I stored them first in dogechian info then I n paper wallet and now in hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-03-20 22:27:57
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:40:24
They now changed the date to DEC 12
@_date: 2018-10-29 06:46:38
I would put a reason just not to have to deal with calls or else but i would" drain" my account slowly but surely and change it in crypto. After all soon thats what everybody will do lol

Ross shouldn't even be in prison. He was just a business guy that's all. I'm for complete freedom. Even if I don't use any illegal drugs, as long as two people want to buy or sell something they should be able to do that without any interference by anyone. The real criminals here are people in the Us government who are incarcerating a young guy who has done zero to deserve this. He has been kidnapped.

i tend to think in bitcoin prices now lol. i have the wirex card , that is the easiest thing to buy , exchange or receive. then i send crypto to my hardware wallet,
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:25:48
true what people say about the fees. when fees will be lower I will use them otherwise I will keep buying bitcoin online from the PC/mobile
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:35:36
never used localbitcoins, don't know if it's trustable, even if i heard that many people buy there. wirex, however, to me seems very fair and safe. you download their app and have to verify a document and take a simple selfie. usually accounts are verified in 5 minutes. . some other websites i used to buy bitcoins are bittylicious and blockchain.info but they were more expensive
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:41:43
very interesting. i watched the video on the website and will download the paper, thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-30 13:10:37
Thanks, it's a nice link and i love geography so for me the visuals of this are even more interesting.  I'm not a miner, i just asked because i wanted to see the correlation between bitcoin price and cost of mining  1 BTC during the past years
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:28:22
Repeat with me" THOU SHALT NOT SELL"
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:01:01
Don't live in France but I'm happy to see this. also i'm a cigar smoker so if fees were good i would have the temptation to say " the change in BTC please " :)
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:28:04
he just shouldn't pay anything, report nothing. crypto is not government business , fuck the governments anyway. even worse , he s in the usa , they re going to use that money in taxes to finance some war somewhere in the world
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:56:51
Good advice , i agree
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:54:23
Did  Jamie Dimon  send you here?
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:23:32
This is my portfolio today. I don't feel scared at all about the recent crash. i bought most of my btc at a level of 4600-8000$(small fractions daily or weekly), the dogecoins were bought super super cheap in 2015 and 2017 before the big spike. i know, back then i should have bought more BTC but back then i didnt understand much about cryptocurrencies. Litecoins were bought at 30-90 euro /coin . GRS stands for groestlcoin, DGB stands for diibyte , JSE coins are being mined by me daily (super easy). i purchased 1 ETH yesterday seen the crazy drop. i hope i will never have to exchange these coins into Fiat again and hope to spend them when the coins will be super valuable as they go up or if I need money. I believe in a decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain future! please let me know what you think if you would have everything in BTC instead or any other comment or advice you want to give
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:50:06
I hope it's a joke lol, because i heard similar stories
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:33:21
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:07:47
you don't seem to have paid a high fee but don't worry , probably in approx 5 hours(out of experience) it will start to confirm. you can see that the priority is low on your transaction. check here:
EDIT: it's confirmed now
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:15:21
Why? better not to ask, i want to avoid making you feel bad.. i prefer to sink with the boat than sell BTC , especially at a loss. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:29:26
I buy 0.01 Btc a day these days on average
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:17:37
he smelled the "money" i guess....well if it can increase adoption. as an outsider i can forget but i didnt know about this. i heard about the bitcoin center i saw a documentary about it.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:19:47
the problems with all these ATMs are the fees, ridicolously high
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:52:49
Welcome aboard, i'm buying fractions of btc daily these days
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:13:08
Wow i must have not paid attention then because i read the article twice and i didnt see he talked about zero value. Btw article is pretty bullish long term
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:49:34
but you still have the coins or you sold?
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:57:41
i buy from wirex, zero fees, well they certainly make a gain but final price for me is low compared to other websites. i also ordered a crypto euro debitt card that should arrive soon. i send the bitcoins to my hardware wallet using theirsite and it gets sent to the blockchain very fast
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:12:10
i once read somewhere that 90 % of Us dollar bills have traces of cocaine .....also i'm sure ALL hitmen are regularly paid in hard cash.i could go on for years listing stuff but i will stop here
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:04:06
this article is "dedicated" To all the detractors, pessimists, BTC trashers, trolls and faketoshis around
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:22:43
Thanks for your comments, really appreciate your advices and ideas i'm considering everything, exchange some alts into btc , go btc only or consider other coins too
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:18:27
It's CONFIRMED NOW
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:48:35
it's a sign LOL
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:26:55
Dear Bot, you can remove my post but come on you should do these stupid robots a bit more intelligent. Do you sense in any way that I want to promote bcash? 
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:53:55
Or Maybe he pays that guy and others to run that subreddit lol
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:42:40
These 5000 will be 5 k$ soon lol ����
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:40:57
500 is not that much but it's not that little. never ever lend any money again, my advice is not to lend it to anyone. just pretend you have nothing
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:26:09
Agree I don't even like cars ahah
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:35:45
In my opinion it is a good "sign" of mass adoption that will eventually come. Who would have made bomb threats in 2012 asking for Btc? Lol
@_date: 2018-12-19 09:55:18
this tells you a lot how this post got 98 % upvotes and so much visibility and it isnt even linked to bitcoin.  when i posted something off topic i was downvoted to 0 ahaha. well there are lots of marijuana smokers in here, i still prefer cigars
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:40:50
The joke started because Lamborghini was the first (and only?) luxury car to accept bitcoin directly as payment
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:37:36
You don't believe in the bitcoin power? 
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:25:30
Or someone who already made a lot of money holding and wants to do more :) 
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:32:51
Hope you didn't lend him a lot of money.... 
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:08:44
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:42:18
I don't know why many people here don't believe that you actually bought 10 BTC. a lot of people have 30.000 $ to invest, less people put it in BTC but you made a good decision, congratulations. whatever the price will be (going up) you should never sell 2 BTC out of 10 you own, under any circumstances unless it hits 10 million $ but if it does you will not have to change it anyway lol
@_date: 2018-12-03 11:42:07
Happy my post got many likes. when i saw it on youtube i said instantly to myself:" i will share it on reddit :)"
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:55:44
very interesting podcast. 38 minutes lenght, click on play after page loads from the link
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:07:46
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:01:28
Correct. Well try to ask for something back at least don't lose hope. For the future this will be a learnt lesson
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:50:53
you got it's a joke, right?
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:52:36
BCH and SV are IMO the most centralized coins in the market , even if they go down to 5 $  i couldn't get myself to buy a single fraction of them lol
