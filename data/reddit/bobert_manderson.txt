In the second quarter of 2018 there were 244 million accounts active worldwide.

You could protest by not using their service. Since they are a private corporation and it the government they can do what they want and suffer the consequences just like Nike did.

They also won't let me use my funds while prices dip and will let me when prices increase. Fuck coinbase.

I've been with them for over 30 years now. Started with car insurance when I was 15, over time now they have my house insurance, banking, car loan, and investments. Still the best.

I joined a long time ago but their shitty customer service and sketchy practices made me quit using them recently.

It’s not even that, I would deposit cash on coinbase with the intent to transfer it to the pro website for trading. They advertise it as a way to avoid fees. The cash would take 3-6 business days to become available in the regular site and if I wanted I could spend that on bitcoins on the regular site with all of its crazy fees. But it wouldn’t let me transfer to pro. I would usually wait a few days and finally I learned that if I didn’t email support asking why I couldn’t transfer my funds to pro it would never make them available to transfer. Usually my funds wouldn’t be available to transfer until there was a huge upswing in BTC price and I missed out on plenty of opportunities to buy low. Fuck coinbase.

They held my funds for 3 weeks until I repeatedly pestered them and complained in reddit. The next time I waited a week to contact customer support and lo and behold as soon as I say something my funds magically are available. Why are you defending them so much, they are known for being shady fuckers.

I like to refer to it as fucking bullshit. It honestly pushed me away from trading crypto. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 22:29:34
Hmm �� almost like that wasn’t always the case and depositing cash through coinbase to transfer to GDAX (now coinbase pro) was the only way to get fiat into a no fee trading platform. Sounds like you didn’t do your homework. And no, I don’t trade any more. I just buy occasionally and hold it. Never going back to coinbase even if they added direct fiat deposit to pro.

During the transition of gdax to coinbase they were not letting me use bank account, only wire. Looks like I was just unlucky to be using it during that time and the workaround was to just deposit to coinbase and transfer the fiat to pro. Just logged on and yeah, it looks way better now and even migrated my bank account to pro, but the way they held my funds until prices were high pissed me off too much to ever use them again.

So now we can’t be critical of others? Sounds an awful lot like you’re looking for a place that you won’t be criticized. A “safe space” of you will. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:35:23
Lol yeah not the best metaphor.

That emoji is enough to keep me away. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:57:05
Still not censorship. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:49:40
Yes.

Bought at 9k. And 8k, 7k, 6k, and cant wait to buy at 4k. Since I spend the same amount each time it’s nice seeing more coins per buck. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:43:37
Lol sure buddy. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:35:25
Good. Been wanting to buy a little more volume at once. I hope it keeps dropping. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:00:49
It’s not. Just what far right loons cry when businesses don’t want them as customers. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:59:10
But how else will they feel superior on the internet? 
@_date: 2018-11-13 22:27:22
Yeah that sub is usually pretty spot on. Sort of like iamverysmart but for politics. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 19:42:43
Is this sarcasm?
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:22:11
They never dismissed, they simply mentioned that the post history calls to lift a certain attitude. Quit playing the victim card. If people wanna post hateful shit, fine but don’t be upset when it other people call you hateful. No censorship there, just common sense. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 22:20:46
Actually I believe businesses should all have the right to refuse service to whoever they want. If some sad fuck doesn’t want to bake a cake for a couple of gay guys that’s his prerogative. He doesn’t get to complain if he loses business because of it though. PayPal sure as hell won’t complain about losing the few whiny pricks who are upset about this nonsense.

Its easy to spot morons because they always have a phrase or word they latch onto and parrot in every argument. NPC is just the newest one from the_donald and it’s fairly ironic.

I bought my first pieces in 2016. Played around with trading and moving. Thought, “this is neat but I need that money now” so I pulled it out. Would’ve made like $5000 if I hadn’t. 
Bought my second pieces now around 7500 and have been day trading with them. New rule though, they stay bitcoins at the end of the day no matter what. 
HODL on.

Don't know how more people aren't seeing this.
