Its been 5 long years of BTC and I'm struggling
Survival got me bugging, but im alive on the bull run
A man with a dream with plans to make crypto
Which failed, i went to sell at the price of 10k yo
A young buck sellin BTC and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch when i HODL  which can make my mind really boggle

So are these lile regular stores but they accept bitcoin? I bet it wouldn't be bad to do here in the states as a niche market.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:18:26
So when BTC gets hacked, can it be recovered? I dont understand here. I thought we had our own keys that were nearly un hackable. I dont understand enough about this sort of thing can someone elaborate?
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:43:42
Thanks man. I was reading about it before too, but how does adding on another layer actually make it faster? Does it pur transactions on the back burner to verify later, or is it really just that quick?
