Bitcoin has got thriving potential and seems to be steadily gaining traction within communities. I have been closely following Bitcoin and DCC and I must say, their progress thus far is excellent
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:25:44
Smart move. You're well set my man.
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:29:09
Using that transfer method makes you anonymous?
@_date: 2018-08-27 02:48:49
Thoroughly nerve wrecking.
@_date: 2018-08-06 05:08:45
Well basically the hate may be founded. Bitcoin in a way determines the price of other coins. Just as developing nations are not huge fans of the super power nations that control the global economy

Thanks man. I'll definitely try that out.
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:59:24
Certainly. Like how does is collapse the market? something is up.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:13:29
Lol agree to disagree fellas. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:18:34
More bitcoin for sure. We need as much of it for the next gen. But  I do believe it is going to go through.
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:49:49
Thank you for staying in this long. You shall not be forgotten comrade.
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:04:23
Lol she doesn't need to see it now. She might get a stroke.
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:18:48
This is insane mockery. Why? just why?
So flipping annoying
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:39:00
That is absolutely true. It's like a bubble filled with helium gas. 
Bitcoin has immense potential
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:13:51
Most definitely . It's just for now. Soon they won't be able to track nothing
@_date: 2018-07-18 08:31:23
I would say the same. Betting site, you definitely need a the luck available lol
@_date: 2018-07-26 03:41:07
You need to market man. How does one get to familiarize people without advertisement .Great project concept man 
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:23:25
Find the two best things in one place. Crypto acceptance and great food
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:53:36
Definitely a long term value. Governments will have a tough time controlling what flows in and out through trade.
@_date: 2018-07-04 02:49:18
Touches base on a lot. What you can do with crypto and a brief history on it.
@_date: 2018-07-10 02:06:15
Wow this is getting hectic. But it will eventually rise looking at past rates . This is just a now thing. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 02:44:32
Time travel ? lol well that's a nice way to put it
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:25:57
