On the other hand, I recently walked through my 85 y/o Grandfather through his first BTC purchase.

Make sure that if you have EVER visited a phishing link, even if you didn't use the link to login - you delete it from your browser history to save yourself from a lapse of concentration and a browser auto complete.

I'd honestly be OK with not mentioning price at all here. This should be a technical sub, not a place where people spam the price. Anyone interested in BTC price is likely checking them themselves.

Pretty understandable as to why it is not yet published as well. Very reasonable that devs wish to tidy it up before making it public, that way outside contribution will be far more seamless. Everyone wins with a bit of patience and good faith.

How can someone interested in crypto and decentralised tech downvote your first comments? Makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:18:50
You are all too unfortunately, correct.

Fuck yes!

You'd expect these kind of words from a group with 'community' in their title. Pity that those pushing SegWit2x don't give a shit about the community.

Lining their pockets.

Anecdotes don't mean much in the grand scheme of things though.

You're underestimating network effects. Thiel is an enormously influential individual and people listen to what he has to say.

Well they are certainly masquerading as that.

Yes, China banned ICOs as a fund raising model - mining was left unaffected.

Sketchy source.

Oof. You went there.

Classic reddit wanting to get the pitch forks out.

A technical issue that prevents mass adoption too.

Yeah, but we all know that Australia is massively behind other Western nations in many regards.

Yeah it's bizarre, they are still very much a cash oriented society. Much like Germans, they seem to have a fear of a cashless society.
