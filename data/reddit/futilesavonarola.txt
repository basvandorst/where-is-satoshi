I have a similar sum bought at a similar time. 
First of all, sell. It's straight out madness to take out mortgages and the like just to be able to hold on to a incredible risky asset like bitcoins. Especially since you have enough to keep a very significant sum of bitcoins. BTC+BCH is over $9000 dollars these days. Even including taxes you need to sell at most 50 bitcoins to be able to buy your house cash, and that is an asset you will always have use for, unlike bitcoin, which future is very much more unknown. 
As for your marriage it is only you who can judge the worth and value of your relation with your wife. Personally, my wife know all details of my bitcoin investments and their financial implications. My advice would be to disclose everything to her and then discuss the alternatives. The risk of loss due to divorce is, I assume, very much dependent on local jurisdiction and the details of your marriage. If that is of significant concern to you I suggest you contact a lawyer. 
This said, I have not sold any significant amounts of bitcoins myself. A small amount I have diversified into eth, but it is minor. I try to buy things with bitcoin whenever possible, but apart from Amazon through Purse it is not very easy to spend any significant sums that way, although over the last 2-3 years I have probably spent $10k+ on purchases made with bitcoins. It is a slow but sure way to cash out. Also tax free if your conscience is not to soft. 
As a side note I'm not primarily using a throwaway account to protect my privacy (although it is a welcome side effect) but due to the fact that I'm banned in this subbed along with many, many more. Point is, you might want to post in the other sub as well since a significant minority of us oldtimers are unable to take part here.
