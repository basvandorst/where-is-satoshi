Oh I see! Thanks so much for the explaination :) I can see why it's such a divisive issue now.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:16:56
Oh I see! Thank you. Long term it sounds like 20 is the way to go then, but as you said if the requirements go up by 20 then perhaps that's too much too soon? I'm surprised a middle ground isn't being discussed, but then I also guess that it's so much work to upgrade that it doesn't make sense to do it in incremements.
@_date: 2014-01-25 09:06:20
She's going to try, but the fact that PayPal have taken the money without even informing her or explaining their reasoning doesn't bode well.
I also guess there's a chance the buyer wouldn't have enough money in their PayPal account to pay it back? It's all a bit of a disaster tbh
@_date: 2014-12-11 07:07:20
The 12 word seed :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:50:02
Thank you, it looks like they will charge a fairly considerable $7.50 for each transaction though? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:43:58
Reminds me of the 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE conversion site.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:08:22
Very honest of you, I could see you hesitating for a moment when you were hovering over your phone... I wasn't sure if you were just ensuring your aim was correct, or if you were really having second thoughts. Wouldn't have blamed you at all for the latter... either way, welcome to Android!
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:03:47
Thank you! Sounds nice and easy. Will download a wallet now :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:45:25
I'm ashamed to say I still don't really fully understand the differences.
I looked at this ELI5 thread: 
But to me I'm struggling to see any negative to the 20mb blocks - what are the potential problems associated with 20mb blocks? Also, would 20mb blocks make transactions faster, or not? IMO the transaction speed needs to be improved somehow.
Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:22:50
Oh! I see... kinda :) I obviously still have a lot to learn about this so thank you for the advice and explanation!
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:04:16
Thank you for the reply... that sounds good, but having to download linux distros, and using code to generate paper wallets... I don't know, I'm not a technophone by any means but all of this just sounds like an accident waiting to happen with me doing it. No doubt I'd make a mess of it and end up losing my coins somehow, or my house would be broken into, or a fire etc etc and I'd lose all of the coins.
It's a shame as I love the idea of Bitcoin, and am a big advocate of it generally, but now I'm really thinking that in it's current iteration it just isn't for me.
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:36:34
Thank you! Coinbase vault looks absolutely fantastic, especially with multisig (so I can keep one key, give another to my parents, and you'd need both to be able to withdraw? And even then there would be a 2 day period that will let me cancel it?!)
Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:28:01
I think the WWF is a much better comparison with Greenpeace than PETA, fwiw.
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:05:43
Thank you, it sounds like I need to be very cautious before just jumping in (or better yet, not jump in at all!)
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:23:37
Thank you! :) But yeah, they accept a number of cryptocurrencies which is neat
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:42:40
Thank you... I'll do some research then :) Though I have to say I'd trust others more than myself, I think. Mostly because I wouldn't want the responsibility though.
I guess a Trezor and a fire proof safe (we need one of these anyway) would be a good buy.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:46:09
Thank you, wow Fiatleak is mesmerising! 
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:41:53
Thank you... I'll do some research then :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:26:00
And then we have to buy more to replace it :)

Thank you so much! Just watched the video... Very interesting - when he kept generating new addresses I was thinking "don't do that! All of the addresses will run out" but I guess the exact point he's making is that he won't :)
What I don't get though is the chance of conflict when picking numbers... So assuming I pick my favourite people, or my favourite colours etc there's surely a chance that someone may pick the same
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:43:19
Thanks, I'm thinking of reading up more on the paper wallets then hopefully moving most of my coins into them and leaving some in an online wallet :)
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:19:48
Looks perfect, thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:09:33
Thank you, though reading around reports on here and bitcointalk it sounds like people are very lucky to even get their initial investment back.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:55:16
Thank you Rich! I'll show her your post and can hopefully win her over. We're based in the UK so the minimum settlement in GBP could prove tricky but hopefully she'll give it a try :)
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:44:51
Still $30 higher than it was an hour ago though!
@_date: 2014-12-09 06:45:48
Thank you, that's a couple of people who have recommended Mycelium now but with how easy it could be to either break or lose my ageing S3 (or next time I update CM etc) I have to say I'm not sure I'd be very trusting of it :(
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:40:03
Very bizarre! Thank you. Time to investigate :)
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:03:34
That sounds fantastic, thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:35:28
Yes, I've been a huge believer in the concept of Bitcoin but if I'm honest am very ignorant to the specifics when it comes to the technical issues, to me this is _really_ worrying... what will happen to the price when the media picks on on the panic?
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:16:03
Thank you for the reply, I'm not sure how NLockTime works but Coinbase's vault basically gives you two days to cancel a withdrawal before it's processed... ie if the account is hacked they would have to wait two days of me not checking my email/phone before the withdrawal goes through.
Coinkite does look very good though, thanks :) If it had the 'Vault' feature I'd go for it for sure, but it's still tempting with the features you mentioned.
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:19:28
This is absolutely fantastic, thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:05:59
Thank you... I guess between the two, I'd prefer the time based withdrawal (I'm usually pretty good at checking up on my emails so would see before a transfer was made) and privacy isn't a big deal for me especially with a platform that is holding my coins
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:39:40
Thank you, I signed up to Coinkite earlier and I'm very interested in the multisig option :)
One thing though, I'm actually now looking at Coinbase as an alternative because I really like the idea of their vault which prevents any withdrawals from being processed for a couple of days.
@_date: 2014-10-02 12:58:21
Thank you for doing the sums, I knew it'd be expensive but I didn't realise it would be quite so much!
I have a Halifax Clarity card that's great for foreign currency which I'm tempted to try, but I'll probably just wait until Circle add the option to buy in GBP.
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:22:12
This is one of the first dips that I haven't bought, usually it drops massively as a result of some temporary bad news but I have absolutely no idea what's causing the drop this time. Whilst I'm still very bullish on Bitcoin, it doesn't make any sense to me that the price is dropping despite so many positive stories.
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:25:44
Thanks! I really like the way bitcoinity works :)
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:46:12
Thank you, I'll give this a look
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:25:56
Thank you! And will do :)

Thank you! She's just read the article and still doesn't think Bitcoin is appropriate for a lingerie site unfortunately, urgh 
@_date: 2014-01-16 13:22:24
Thank you, BitPay would be perfect, but unfortunately it looks as if there is a [£1,000 minimum]( payout in GBP.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:41:25
Thank you, neither of them are the site I was looking for in particular, but both are still a huge improvement on what I normally use :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 06:45:57
Thank you, so how would you store it?

Thanks, I've noticed a couple of mentions for Greenaddress now - going to check it out properly and compare it to the others :)
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:18:09
Fair point, you're not wrong but it's still a good service and honestly I'd trust them with my wallet more than I'd trust myself.
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:45:07
Thank you, that sounds great! I'll look into it now.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:52:30
Um, something like that yeah :)

@_date: 2014-10-02 11:46:03
I didn't say the fees were from Circle's end, nor the exchange rate, but currently I can only buy in USD.
I contacted them yesterday and they said:


So, still no timeline for when I can buy Circle in my native currency (GBP)
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:30:20
Bitcoins are not easy to buy for non-US residents still... to buy from Circle I'd have to pay a small fee, plus a fixed % fee, plus suffer an awful exchange rate.
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:34:04
Exactly my thoughts too, I think we're probably better off not worrying about it until the tax laws are set in stone, I'd be amazed if CGT didn't apply after a year
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:21:40
Whilst I agree with you, in pretty much anything other than Bitcoin, 7% would be a significant drop...
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:21:38
How did you pay for these? Just using a wallet on your Android phone, and then scanning the QR code and entering the amount? I've bought a few things online using Bitcoin, but want to make sure I'm prepared in case I ever see something like this in a store and would like to get something :)
@_date: 2014-01-17 23:19:56
Wait so... If you hold onto the coins for a year or more, it will be completely exempt from capital gains tax!?
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:43:50
Thanks, it looks like on sites such as Coinbase and Coinkite you can take sole ownership of the key (or multisig etc)
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:20:47
Thanks, I've noticed a couple of mentions for Greenaddress now - going to check it out properly and compare it to the others :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:53:11
Thank you, that's part of the problem though - I'd trust a bank with my money far more than I would it being in my house. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 11:40:52
 - the site doesn't exactly inspire me with confidence, but good luck to them.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:19:58
Thank you... as I said in the original post I've heard great things about Trezor but honestly I would trust one of the companies above to hold onto the coins more securely than I could at home, IMO. I know there are backups and failsafes but I'd also be worried that it'd get damaged, break in some way or simply I'd screw up and lose my coins with a Trezor.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:03:10
Thank you for your carefully reasoned (and re-assuring!) post
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:24:14
Thank you, a few people have recommended a Trezor now but as it's at this level I'll reply here... basically, this looks like a great idea, but I'm worried it'd get stolen, or broken, or if there was a fire etc etc... I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable having it around the house, similar with a paper wallet I guess.
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:22:06
I would buy the hell out of Bitcoin if it dropped to $200 again
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:18:47
Thank you, I do quite like that they're a huge organisation (as far as Bitcoin goes) and have the insurance. Mostly the Vault feature is what's tempting me towards Coinbase though.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:30:58
I'm *really* hoping now I can finally convince my girlfriend to integrate Bitpay into her Opencart store.
@_date: 2014-12-09 06:45:42
Thank you, that's a couple of people who have recommended Mycelium now but with how easy it could be to either break or lose my ageing S3 (or next time I update CM etc) I have to say I'm not sure I'd be very trusting of it :(
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:27:57
I know this was posted only recently by the site creator but it went mostly unnoticed here (I was the only person to comment) and I figured it deserved more exposure.
For probably around a year now I've been wishing that you could buy gift cards in the UK just like you do in the US via Gyft but they've constantly stalled in implementing UK gift cards and pock.io have done a fantastic job - a very easy to use site, a great conversion rate and a very good starting variety of gift cards.
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:21:01
Thank you! The site looks great - I am tempted to invest, of all the sites this one looks the best I think, and the most professional/ethical :)
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:32:49
I've noticed this to be the case for every user, not just me - is there any particular reason behind it?
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:18:03
Thank you, I'm not after a swiss army knife per se... I actually want something that's incredibly simple to use (idiot proof!) but also something that's going to be secure for the long run. Still seems like Coinkite could be the best option :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:51:58
Thank you, i feel I need to do a lot of research then because I can imagine myself forgetting or losing those words somehow - do I need only the words to get the BTC? What if I have the same words as someone else? 
@_date: 2016-06-18 12:51:15
The reason it isn't higher is because way too many people here are willing Ethereum to fail, thinking it will make Bitcoin stronger and increase the price - IMO, in the long term that is absolutely not true. I think both can exist and thrive, and as we have just seen, they can possibly learn a lot from each other too.
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:15:39
Well, this is his chance to prove you wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-18 15:29:13
Good shout, thank you, but then my bank would charge a fee plus a currency conversion charge on top - still would be less than £60 though I guess!
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:56:21
I'm in the UK and all bank transfers within the same country are free. To use my debit card I don't pay any fees. To use my credit card I actually get cashback.
PayPal, Skrill and Neteller all let me transfer money globally for free.
I bought a £10 Steam gift card the other day for a friend using Bitcoin and it cost me 80p. That's a fee of 8% on what I would personally consider not to be a spam transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-18 09:30:02
£60 withdrawal fee for GBP is quite obscene :(
Shame there aren't really any other alternatives right now other than selling through somewhere like Localbitcoins
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:22:31
In this case, isn’t it a good idea to start with the APU and then buy the graphics card at a later date if and when you need one?
As someone still happily rocking an 8 year old cheap Dell with a 750 Ti put in a few years ago, the idea of an APU intrigues me and would no doubt be an upgrade for me.
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:22:41
Thanks, Lazycoins looks good but it isn't apparent how I'd buy using GBP? Unless I'm missing something
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:21:30
Thank you, very good shout on bittylicious!
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:45:35

@_date: 2015-09-02 06:01:56
Even on here the response is worryingly muted. Large bank announces it's going to start processing Bitcoin payments - 150 upvotes after 7 hours?!
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:46:09
Thanks, I quite like bitbargain but it's very similar to localbitcoins and maybe a bit more expensive.
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:20:34
Sounds perfect, thanks!
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:06:03
Thanks, I'll give it a miss then :)
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:52:13
Ah, that's very interesting, thank you! I guess the one thing that doesn't factor is the phycological issues also - either that people will be fearful that a big dump of coins will drop the price, or the other way where it'll act as free publicity and people buy more.
Or maybe they will cancel each other out and like you said, it shouldn't make much difference :)
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:20:08
God this place is so much more fun when the price is going up
@_date: 2015-11-05 21:07:46

Realistically, will this have a meaningful impact on price?

Random question, but would increased use of the blockchain have an impact on the Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2015-10-29 13:59:30
Thanks. And can these companies use the blockchain without owning any Bitcoin? I mean, is there an actual direct correlation between blockchain use and the Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2015-02-07 08:03:26
Please forgive me if this is a stupid thing to say, but whenever I see things like this it just seems like a horrible waste of equipment and energy. Are any of the alternatives (ie. proof of stake) viable?
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:49:16
A world where animals aren't harmed and killed for our own selfish purposes sounds boring? It sounds amazing to me. Bring it on.

Very interesting, thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:40:12
Thank you very much for the response, one thing that makes me trust in the site as it is (and you!) is that it'd probably be very short-sighted to actually take people's coins... it'd have huge repercussions, and right now you can get on average 0.001% (I think?) of every single bet placed on the site anyway! :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:15:45
Thank you, bitcoinpaperwallet looks perfect, hopefully you're right about the value increasing too! :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:49:36

@_date: 2013-12-13 13:50:44
Sounds great, thanks - the person I'm getting it for is on Android so that could be a great solution
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:07:30
Oh, I see - thanks for the explanation, the way you've setup the site with investors really is win/win, IMO :)
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:43:34
Yup I was thankfully :) in for the long haul!
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:51:41
Thank you :) Sounds pretty straightforward and nice to have a few different options for the import
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:03:54
This looks perfect, thank you! :)
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:44:43
That is absolutely insane!
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:40:50
Not a bad thing really, since with Bitcoin you're not limited to spending the money at a specific store, no expiry dates, risk of the company going bust etc
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:03:38
Fair point... it was for my little cousin, so I figured at the very least he could use it to buy a Humble Bundle or two. I'm kinda hoping that Steam will accept Bitcoin at some point too, just thought it was potentially quite a novel gift idea.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:50:06
This sounds great, thanks -didn't realise you could simply scan the QR code :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:22:47
Well, like I said I think it's a great idea so thanks for making the site - my only complaint (if you can even call it that) is there are so many investors it's almost impossible to make a dent in the total invested %... I guess on the plus side that smooths out the big wins a lot more at least :D
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:47:49
BitBargain is good from experience, for both BTC and LTC: 
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:26:57
It's very similar to Bitcoin but has a few key differences (in particular when it comes to mining, which sounds like it won't directly effect you) but one of the main differences is the uptake and adoption levels for Bitcoin at present completely dwarfs people's awareness of LTC, hence BTC is valued much (much!) higher. 
People (incorrectly or correctly, I don't know) have sometimes compared Bitcoin to gold, and Litecoin to silver.
You can read more about it here: 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:08:22
That would mean insane profit for anyone who can actually time it...
It's sad but I'm actually hoping for a bit of a crash now, so I can get some more coins
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:14:14
Thank you :) Yes that was the plan, just buy some chocolate to go along with the BTC. The idea generally was to get him a Steam gift card for a similar amount, but like I said, the Bitcoin thing seems a bit more novel (and he is very techy, probably more so than me)
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:51:01
Thank you :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:15:09
That's an understatement! Lucky nephews :)
