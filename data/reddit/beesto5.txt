I don’t know if I would say it’s back up necessarily
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:42
Don’t bother talking to Coinbase, they can’t do anything for you. The transaction is sent. Talk to the person you sent it to

Sounds like me. I strategically time my buys at ATH’s
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:50:13
Shit I’m just wishing I had a job instead of in college when it was at $200 because then I would have bought 10 instead of just 1

Take a look at the depth chart for orders on gdax. I’m not seeing anything anytime soon
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:28
Who knows. May never dip
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:24
The problem is I already spent my money on the last three dips
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:09:15
That’s the insane part. After watching 19.5 yesterday and the crash, 15k still feels like shit until I pull up the weekly chart and realize we’re doing pretty good
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:18
Coinbase is extra slow right now. They probably haven’t confirmed the transaction. It’ll probably take a few hours at this rate
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:47
It’s just a matter of when
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:07
That’s the golden question. 30 minutes ago it dipped $500 and within the minute it was back
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:26
Depends on who you ask. There is no threshold that it reaches and then it’s invincible. But look at the charts, there’s billions of dollars being traded every day.
I mean it just broke 16k
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:47
You fucking kidding, prep the 18k NOW. It’s 17.5
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:02
Prep the “It’s over 90,000” memes for next year
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:13:29
The madness!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:12
Your investment is already paying off. Check out gdax charts right now. Good timing
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:32
Go pull up the 12 month chart of btc and see for yourself 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:22:51
By the end of the week? While I’ve been typing this it’s gone from 16200 to 16900
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:20
A ledger nano or trezor is about $100. If you have over 1k I would say you NEED a hardware wallet to keep at least the majority of it on.  At that point it’s a 10% investment for security
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:24
Coinbase is overloaded right now, very slow. I recommend moving your coins somewhere else if you have a decently secure wallet.
As for the ones you sent, the ledger is proof that payment was sent. You might have to call them, but you did pay them.
