If you actually read the blogpost (and/or the previous one) you'll see that they talk explicitly about hardware attacks and compromises and how they are secure against those. e.g. see the "what about hardware attacks.." section:

Why do the performance results sound like bulls**t? From what I know of this project already, using trusted hardware like they do provides some pretty good performance benefits, no?

That's fair.. although they do say the results will be released in a future blogpost, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see!

I think "synchronous blockchain access" is another way to describe the "always online" problem in off-chain networks, like the Lightning Network?

I actually had a read through the README. It looks like:
(1) the GitHub repo doesn't contain the binaries, but instructions for downloading the binaries/package through the website (see the section titled: "Downloading the Teechain binaries")
(2) the README also talks about Side-Channel attacks and how they are handled at the software layer. I'm not sure if these are meant to include Spectre types attack or not though (see the FAQ)
(3) Regarding SGX counters, I'm not an expert, but from what I remember, Intel issued several patches to the ME to fix the code execution bugs. I also remember someone telling me that Intel's remote attestation has a way of ensuring that these patches are applied otherwise attestation will fail.
