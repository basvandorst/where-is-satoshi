You will be fine. They will have to be really desperate to try and impersonate someone, and the exchange has to have some really dumb staff in order to fall for it :)
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:03:32
I really like the Ledger, never used the Trezor but heard good things as well. 
Note: Ledger got so popular they have backorders till March, luckily they've had some investors pour in tons of money to ramp up production and clear the backlog as soon as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:44:07
You are completely right. But as of now, far superior (my opinion) verification systems have entered the market which could potentially be as secure and work better as a digital currency.
I understand why people are so passionate about Bitcoin, it's the reason all of us are here after all, but in the end I think tech will eventually win.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:00:59
Good, mining has no longer a future in this world, it's bad in the long run and better options have arisen (just my 0,02 cents, hate all you want with your fancy rigs).
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:47:59
Can anyone explain to me why I should keep using Bitcoin as a currency without going through this entire lightning payment channel hassle? I mean... there are coins out there that offer instant and feeless transactions with the click of a button, no workaround, right now, even without the huge waste of power consumption (mining)... Why would I still choose Bitcoin over those currencies? What does Bitcoin still have to offer (except for brand, and highest market cap) that others don't already have?
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:18:39
I saw a post recently that it's not smart to post your ticket number anywhere public, because people could try and impersonate you. Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:01:47
System upgrade, check Twitter.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:13:05
Dude, this was a month ago, what are you on about. Coinbase sucks, we all know.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:54:47
You do realize that it's because of people like you the price is dropping right? Just hold, be patience, this is normal.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:32:06
I've gotten two DM's of people promoting Bcash lol, they are getting desperate.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:41:40
You are right, but there are other verification systems by now, far superior tech (that still has to fully prove itself) which I think is a better alternative.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:31:19
Using it for a few weeks, works perfectly for me.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:56:02
Better invest in some coins in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:09:30
Bye bye
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:43:25
Copycats? There are others out there that make Bitcoin obsolete and outdated, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:43:38
Ugh, sounds like a lot of hassle to do a damn transaction. Hope I'm wrong... 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:21:30
I feel like mining will be banned globally eventually. Think about it. Think about the power it consumes at this very moment. It's not sustainable, it's bad, and there are better alternatives than solving cryptopuzzles. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:45:25
Smart people harming the environment, good call.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:51:09
Don't take it too seriously, not a fan of the whole mining thing, just my opinion, I feel like there could be better alternatives.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:11:26
Good, was getting tired of seeing all these shitty coin ads.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:46:23
Hahaha okay buddy, was just stating facts.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:53:53
Mining of crypto currently uses more power than several countries combined, just think about that, and think about the future... It was a revolutionary tech back in the day, we can all agree on this, but I think it is not sustainable this way, the more it grows the more it will consume and harm. Yes, green and overproduced (or whatever you name it) energy is used by certain big mining farms, but every average joe can buy mining rigs, hook em up, and shoot their electricity bill to the moon, just because they can make money the easy way.
Several other coins are already proving they can have a way faster, feeless and as secure/decentralized network without the need of miners. I think those coins will be the future digital currencies, or whatever best techs will pop up and wins the race.
Just my opinion, and I do own BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:49:57
Mineable coins are terrible for the environment and will unfortunately have no place is the distant future if we keep going at this pace, this is my opinion, not hating. I'm just wondering how this is even allowed. Mining consumes more than some entire countries do, think about that...
Also, new coins coming out with far superior tech that are as secure and don't require any mining...
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:47:24
Why would you subscribe to such a site in the first place? NOBODY can predict the market. You are better off doing research yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:32:22
Bitcoin? Lol.

Piss off, reported.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:07:03
Patience my friend, by the way there are many sites you can buy from. BTCDirect is also a fast way (but higher fees).
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:11:20
Do some research, learn their technologies... Nobody can predict the market, so if you're only in it for the money, it will always be a gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:14:32
Why? To improve performance, support, move coins from cold storage to online storage, increase security, ... If you don't have patience, crypto might not be a thing for you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:04
Get a Ledger Nano S or Trezor, they are worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:23
Wallstreet is here, these guys don't trade in a few BTC's, they haul millions a day.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:29:15
Lol... Okay there, crystal ball.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:07:36
This is obviously a fake site dude, you can tell immediately by the looks of it. Stay away from it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:22:30
Then I would recommend buying one from Bitmain as it is the most well known.
AliExpress and other chinese websites offer more cheaper ones but not sure if they can be trusted.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:23:04
Just hold lol, don't give in to the FUD
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:36:27
Most likely a network issue, the Ledger probably can't retrieve the info from the blockchain. Merry x-mas!
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:51:41
We need more things to spend or coins on. Right now it is just a store of value, we need more businesses to start accepting it. Only a 'handful' have adopted it as a payment method so far.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:53:07
I have a Nano myself and I love it. I feel a lot better now that my funds are safe. Apart from some network issues lately, it's pretty easy to use and secure.
Trezor should be good as well.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:12
FUD attack probably. They even have huge discord groups where they organise these things, also pumps and stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:09:50
That's indeed the biggest problem we are currently facing. Actually I see BTC more as a giant digital gold mine or storage, something like that, while other currencies could perhaps be used for microtransactions with little to no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:05:59
Invest that money in a few coins instead of mining
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:17:25
Supply and demand
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:09:35
Ledger Nano S :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:15:57
Nobody can predict the market. I'm curious what's going to happen after Sunday once the 'big boys' start entering the market. We could skyrocket, are go down, nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:06:04
Depends on what they will censor. Maybe the Americans will have to pay 30$ monthly to access crypto sites, lol.
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:58:09
Can a DAG, which has no fees and no mining, be copied and used with this ledger? I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:22:32
Well it took BTC over 8 years and it still has major issues. That's why they decided to start from scratch and took a different approach. The internet itself wasn't stable in the first two years either. 
I personally think it has enormous potential, but as of now, they have some major issues to fix and prove their network actually works.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:42:30
You know when people start calling Bitcoin a currency, it can and will be regulated, right?
Bitcoin is not a currency in my opinion. It's just a commodity, a database, a product that people buy WITH currency. It's basically just text and mathematics. Or I'm I seeing this wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:56
Noobs selling, FUD, correction...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:41
Supply and demand I guess?
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:14:06
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:06:17
I kinda have a feeling that most of these trolls bought BCH at an ATH and lost some moneys, and therefor are trying desperately to lure people into their coin.
Imagine being a serious investor, a massive whale, and you end up in that subreddit... Lol, good luck getting new people on board.
But once LN comes to BTC and is successful, I think BCH will slowly die out.
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:01:25
It can function as a store of value, but that's it. No way it can function as a day to day payment or transaction currency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:21:49
Don't mine, just buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:41:13
It's never too late, at least for now I think it's still worth it.
You might however want to look at some altcoins as well to increase your percentages / profits.
Take a look at Ripple, Cardano, Stellar, IOTA,... these are still fairly cheap and I'm certain they will greatly increase in the future.
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:39:10
Few of several hundreds.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:57:31
They are spreading everywhere, lol.
I've encountered them in the XRP, IOTA and even XLM subs. I still think these are just paid trolls or something, can't understand how a normal human being can be this salty and toxic.
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:07:17
The maximalist cringe is hard on this post, ugh.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:14:34
What have we learned? Hodl!
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:17:40
I would stick with the well-known sites. There are thousands of scam sites out there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:42:50
Just buy them mate, only if you have special hardware you will be able to mine... And difficulty will increase -&gt; less money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:31:32
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:21:13
Well we'd have to find a different solution than Bitcoin because it can't support the entire world, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:20:14
Yep, reported
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:17:58
Put those 1000-2000 bucks in some (alt)coins instead. Miners are loud, hot, require a ton of power and maintenance...
@_date: 2018-09-16 20:40:39
Sample size = 14.000 people. This gives an unrealistic view.
@_date: 2018-09-23 17:17:31

They are, as always, experiencing heavy loads of traffic and purchases. I think they even went down again multiple times this week.
I was able to verify within a few minutes few weeks ago. Just give them a little more patience.
@_date: 2018-09-09 08:46:02
I think there are just too many issues with crypto right know for it to be adopted on a massive scale.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:46:00
If an entire country would be using a blockchain it would suffocate lol. Fees would skyrocket again. That's what I meant.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:51:57
Patience! It's still in very early beta stage.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:36:42

20 per month, holy crap. That's like an hour work in my country.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:50:12
It would be a good place to store their money. But for day to day payments and transactions... meh.
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:58:49
Saying all current 'alt coins' are idea incubators is straight up ignorant and retarded. Some of these 'incubators' are functioning literally an 100x better than Bitcoin currently does, with some even having more advanced features and wasting 1000...x less resources. Just think about that... Although some are not as battle tested as Bitcoin, I'll give em that.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:30:28
Yeah I've read that they often require a lot of maintenance, there are fire risks, software bugs etc.
@_date: 2018-09-10 10:47:04
Facts ≠ stupidity.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:28:03

IOTA is definitely going to do some great things in the future, as it is still in a beta-phase. But they really gotta step up their game, improve security and release a decent wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:55:51
I don't think he was. He asked the IOTA subreddit for some information regarding their technology, developers, marketing, etc., because he noticed a lot of hate and FUD towards it in the media.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:48:09
"Not your private keys, not your coins" is what you should remember. You don't know what's going on behind the scenes of an exchange or online wallet, and if something ever happens, your coins are gone...
It's best to move them over to a desktop/mobile wallet so you control your private keys. For bigger investments and more security, buy a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:18:53
It is a waste though. It's uses more energy than several countries combined while it's barely even used (compared to fiat that is). There's just so much money and resources involved in mining that those participating won't acknowledge it. 
Yes it's secure, but is it worth it in it's current state? No way.
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:28:56
If Google ever decides to seriously make a move into crypto, they'll be at the top of the game in no time... Just think about all the resources they would be able to put into this.
@_date: 2018-09-16 00:00:34
BTC will completely take over? Lol.
@_date: 2018-08-20 14:09:45

Damn. Maximalists crawling out of their caves.
@_date: 2018-08-20 13:56:55
These ads, ICO's, crappy crypto blogs and journalists, useless money grabbing projects,... are the cancer of crypto and do not benefit adoption.
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:30:06
Probably all of those things. Cash out a certain amount over a period of time and leave the rest divided among certain projects, that's what I would do.
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:06:26
Because they believe that they are the real Bitcoin and are trying to lure new people in by using Bitcoin's name and brand. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:16:29
Heard it was a shitcoin though.
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:22:37

@_date: 2018-08-25 14:15:56
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:34:18
No. Bitcoin is nowhere near a 'perfect' or 'final' cryptocurrency. It will take dozens of years before a cryptocurrency could ever replace fiat.
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:51:05
A country will not adopt a high volatile and irrational cryptocurrency / market,... they can't control.

Mods really need to start banning these type of posts.
@_date: 2018-05-21 10:24:03
God these kinds of articles have to stop. Are people seriously going to report everytime Bitcoin increases or decreases a couple of percentages? Holy crap crypto-journalism is the worst.
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:29:26
I disagree. Distributed Ledger Technology is evolving fast, and there are already projects arising with far better technology, possibilities and non singular use cases like Bitcoin. 
They might want to get rid of the absolute waste of mining first, before making 'others obsolete'. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:37:06
Don't mine, it's a waste of energy and resources unless you spend thousands of dollars on special hardware. Diversify your funds over a few projects. Do your own research, don't trust anyone on here.
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:09:01
BTC will not take over the financial world and is not a 'final' cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:46:28
Institutional money won't be entering crypto unless things start to change, drastically.
Currently about 85&amp; of the ICO's, tokens and coins are absolutely worthless crap or scams with barely any real world use cases, still money keeps flowing into these projects at crazy rates. This market is too crazy and irrational for the big boys.
Once they hear about all the scams, hacks, huge amount of energy that goes to waste, thousands of different projects built for just singular problems that doesn't even require a DLT, etc. Do you think they'll still invest in this mess? How do you think non\-tech savvy people experience crypto right now? It's a disaster for newcomers.
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:41:54
I agree, heavy PoW is not sustainable. Especially not in the coming years. We will probably have far better and more sustainable alternatives in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:12:15
I hate these bullshit articles.

@_date: 2018-05-19 20:41:43
Mining is a waste, PoW does not have a bright future. There are far better alternatives already.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:12:08
Lol, these are absolutely pathetic statements that have been debunked so many times already. Shows you have done barely any research on IOTA lately and are just a fudding sheep that follows the maximalist herd. 
But yeah, I'm guessing we both are smarter than the companies IOTA has partnered with right? Those multi-billion dollar megacorps bigger than the entirety of crypto? Right? I'm guessing they blindly invest and adopt this technology for fun, ri.. right? 
But nahhh, lets just keep spreading the same debunked shit over and over again because I'm scared my 1000$ investment is threatened!
God, this market sucks.
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:48:39
And I predict BTC to dry out, who cares? Pure speculation, predict whatever you want. It makes zero sense.
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:01:57

Bull run imminent? Nobody knows, might as well go down much more or stay stagnant. ��

It's complete and utter crap.
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:30:11
And a very good chance to be wrong as well.
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:02:11
I do lack them indeed.
I just know Bitcoin, in its current state, is not able to replace fiat, it's having a hard time at busy times already... (yeah LN and all that isn't really fit for mass adoption either) and also things like this won't magically happen overnight and will probably take many months or years to implement. I do however believe we will be using a digital currency in the future as the old (or current) system doesn't seem to work that well.

Wrong on what critiques? There are projects with 100x the transaction speed of Bitcoin, on which you pay zero fees, with some of them providing a ton more features like transfering data, etc. which require no mining and thus don't waste so much energy. These are facts.
They might not have been battle tested like Bitcoin has, but in my opinion have a much brighter future ahead...
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:21:58
I know it serves a function. Bitcoins are distributed in a kind of lottery where each ticket is purchased with electricity... Do you realize how much energy goes into solving these 'crypto-puzzles'? And how much worse it's going to get? While far better alternatives are arising...

I'm very passionate about Bitcoin, don't get me wrong, but "all the innovation is happening in Bitcoin"? Dude, this is absolutely wrong. Bitcoin might be the first of its kind and the biggest crypto to date, but it's years behind regarding tech on some of the projects that are arising these days...

Don't mine, the craze is over \(and it's a waste imho\). You have to invest a significant amount in order to make some profits.
Either invest in a few promising projects for long term hold or pull out if you don't feel comfortable anymore. I've traded all my Bitcoin for other coins/tokens because I personally think it will never be a 'final' cryptocurrency, even with LN \(will probably get hated for this\). Especially now that the technology is advancing faster than ever. Bitcoin IS years behind on some already, this is a fact.

If you've been following the news lately you should know why. IOTA is closest to major adoption and well on their way of becoming the backbone of IoT (which in the next few years will be a market in the trillions $) and they are backed by industry leading mega-companies. They also set up a legal non-profit organisation in Germany, which means they don't give a crap about prices and values, they are in it for the technology. Now with more information revealed around Qubic, they have an infinite number of use cases that can be built on a scalable and fee-less protocol. 
Also, check out their developers and advisors... That alone should open peoples eyes.

@_date: 2017-11-21 08:59:48
I don't think they 'split' user bases. I think it is some kind of subsidiary they took over or are cooperating with to provide a better service. Coinbase and GDAX are working fine, all exchanges have problems, especially during these times.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:47:24
Hodling it is then :D
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:20:56
That's right, because LTC has lower fees than BTC. I only used Shapeshift so far and does a good job for me, there are exchanges that also allow you to buy/trade many altcoins, I think Binance or something does this. But Shapeshift is just the easiest way.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:13:06
I'm guessing it is not possible to use the seed more than once? I own a Ledger so I'm not sure how the Trezor works, I only know you should be able to use the seed to recover your 'account' instead of configuring a new one on startup. Might be worth asking at the Trezor subreddit?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:21:08
I personally use Coinbase to deposite my Euros - I'm from Belgium - via bank tranfers (1-2 days). Then I transfer it to GDAX and exchange it for the currency I want, this way the fees stay low. 
I usually exchange to BTC for long term investment. In case I want to buy an altcoin, I buy LTC and exchange this afterwards using something like Shapeshift.
Heard good things about Bitstamp for the UK as well, never used it tho.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:55:28
Lol, this is shady as hell. Barely any information on their website. Looks like it was made with a free web-host of some sorts.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:58:22
Many of the major exchanges went down, even some smaller websites. They couldn't handle all the new traffic, so when the first one goes down, everybody switches over to the next one, which then goes down as well... We are getting lots of mainstream attention so they can't handle the new folks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:44
Well, for now none of them seem to be good. All of them are having trouble handling this traffic. Even some small websites I use are down.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:23:13
On Coinbase you pay for the convenience they offer you, you can easily buy and sell coins without having any knowledge of trading/crypto whatsoever, that's why they charge extra... I guess.
GDAX is an exchange for trading currencies, but it is owned by Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:29:46
If they ask for an identity card, you know they probably take it serious.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:58:13
Check their twitter or status page, should keep you up to date. But you are right, hopefully they learned their lesson and will step up their game
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:23:51
Yes indeed, if you use bank transfer it's reasonable depending on the amount you deposit. It's a convenient platform, but you pay (much) for it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:34:08
First of all, get a hardware wallet (Nano ledger or Trezor) before buying such big amounts.
Then there are several ways to buy bitcoins, or any other altcoin. This is done on an exchange, a place where fiat money is traded for coins. These are the ways I buy them:
+ First, create an account on Coinbase and verify it. Coinbase is one of the biggest digital asset brokers and is pulling in tens of thousands of new users daily. However, they tend to be very slow on support, so try to avoid needing it ;).
+ Once verified, head over to GDAX, which is an exchange platform that is owned by Coinbase. Login to GDAX using the same credentials as you used for Coinbase. (You could buy BTC directly on Coinbase as well, but they charge high fees)[
+ Once GDAX is up and running, deposit fiat money to this account using bank transfer (recommend but slow, low fees) or credit card (instantly, high fees).
+ Then exchange your fiat money to BTC using a limit buy order. (Little tutorial here)[
+ Voila! You have your first coins listed on GDAX!
+ Most important step: get your coins away from the exchange, don't leave em their! They have full control over your coins and should something ever happen to the company, your bamboozled.
+ Send your fresh coins to a mobile, desktop, or preferably a hardware wallet!
If you are located in Europe, you could also buy them with many payment options on LiteBit. You can directly buy BTC with your fiat money but they charge a little fee. Once bought, transfer the coins to your personal wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:54:07
I also have a prepaid debit card, but that card is still owned by my bank (at least here in Belgium it works this way I guess). I just had a hard time believing all these 'whales' or millionaires just exchanged all their coins into fiat with the click of a button so to speak.
It's good to see more businesses are thinking of using or accepting crypto tho!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:52
A lot of platforms are having serious trouble at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:48:30
They just popped up out of nowhere, so we don't know for sure if it's a scam or not. In my opinion the site looks really cheap without much information.
+ "What is your company name and official address or any contact details apart from this twitter account and email address?"
Barely any info on their site. Looks like they just put a sticker on a S9.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:01:10
Not sure how a Trezor works but... can't you buy a new device, enter your seed there, and recover the coins?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:00:10
Should have said 'lower fees' instead of 'low fees'. And don't buy coins on Coinbase, buy them on GDAX...
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:25:44
Coinbase is fine, not the best, but fine. And GDAX is a good exchange as well for newcomers. I've done several transactions and trades on this platform without a single problem. Just don't keep your funds on their wallet and try to avoid needing their support.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:12:02
What a shitpost. Almost all exchanges had outages, even some smaller websites. Nobody expected or was prepared to handle these volumes...
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:22:19
Yep, transfer it to GDAX (the exchange from Coinbase). 
OP check out this [video](
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:14:49
Did you fill in the correct reference code? Maybe your bank has blocked or frozen the money somehow? I've read that as well, it could be your bank that is taking longer due to the big amount of money.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:30:34
Not sure. Credit cards are instant, but you pay high fees for it. Might be other websites that are able to handle this faster, but bank transfers always take a while unfortunately :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:46:27
There you go buddy! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:46:21
Move your money to GDAX, this is the exchange from Coinbase. You can use the same credentials as Coinbase and login there.
There you can switch your Euros to BTC without fees and afterwards move it to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:36:41
8000 bitches? Damn, where did you get those?
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:02:35
Fairly easy as well, you send it back to the exchange and sell it for fiat with just a few clicks. I'm using GDAX for this. It looks overwelming at first but is actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it.
GDAX is the exchange from Coinbase, so this is what you do:
Get a verified account on Coinbase / GDAX  -&gt; deposit money on GDAX -&gt; buy BTC, LTC or ETH for AUD -&gt; transfer to wallet. And vice versa.
Oh, and use bank transfer! It's slower but less fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:49:34
Bitcoin is currently all over the news, their network / traffic is being overloaded with new users in the tens of thousands each day. Maybe that is why they charge high fees? I'm not sure. Also consider using bank transfer, it takes a little longer for your money to arrive, but you pay very low fees.
For fees see following link:
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:48:03
Depends what you are in for... making a quick buck, or long term gains?
If you just want to make some profits, you could sell and buy back in when it's lower (if it goes lower at all...) or you could just hold on to them, and sell when it's tickling the Moon :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:55:01
Can you adopt me? :3
I'm not sure since most exchanges have some sort of limit that you can deposit. I personally use Coinbase + GDAX because the fees will stay low. Heard some good things about Bitstamp as well. Not sure about Kraken or Bittrex, never used them before.
+ Buy a Ledger Nano before you buy such amounts!
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:02:29
I'm still a huge noob. But, for example, when a peak occurs and I want to sell my BTC's (or any other coin), wouldn't it be hard to move the coins from the paper wallet to the exchange to sell them, because of all the transaction times/huge traffic?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:57:09
Could be the start of something great! :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:18:40
Yes, GDAX will spare you from the high fees ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:56:42
It's not recommended to leave them on an exchange for several reasons:
+ You don't control your private keys/seeds, should anything ever happen to the exchange platform (if it gets hacked for example) you can kiss your coins goodbye because there is no way of retrieving them without a private key or seed.
+ If you drop them in a good wallet, you have control over your private keys and seeds, so should your hard drive ever crash, you can retrieve them.
You can leave small amounts on an exchange if you are a trader, but I would recommend getting them off GDAX and only send them back once you want to trade it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:16:52
Not sure, good question tho.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:08:49
Not sure, I'm from Belgium and don't seem to have any problems. I've heard good things about Bitstamp as well, and they are based in the UK, could be worth looking into?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:22:38
So you have to be on Reddit for x-amount of time to give your opinion about something? 
I just think the site looks really unprofessional with barely any info on it. But more news articles start to pop up, so let's hope these guys can deliver!
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:42:25
Been using Coinbase + GDAX for a while, never had any problems so far (except for a few slow transactions). And it's pretty simple: deposit money on Coinbase -&gt; move it to GDAX -&gt; buy BTC with your money -&gt; move BTC to a wallet (don't leave it on the website!)
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:56:12
A hardware wallet is always recommended, but depends on the amount you are wanting to invest or in worst case scenario, lose. Anything above $500 is worth getting a hardware wallet for, in my opinion.
Buying and selling takes place on online sites or applications. Some well known are GDAX (Coinbase), Bitfinex, Poloniex, Binance, etc. This is where you deposit fiat currency, change it to cryptocurrency, then transfer it to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:26:20
You should check the bitcoin cash subreddit, have never seen so many trolls grouped together. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:25:30
Check out Vertcoin! They already have a one-click-miner but it's a very popular coin for GPU miners and the community will definitely help you out.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:23:46
Use GDAX, it's the exchange from Coinbase. You can transfer it and sell it without fees I think.

What's with all the hate suddenly, at first everyone was praising Coinbase and the GDAX exchange...
I get it, it was messed up yesterday. But all major exchanges had outages and severe problems. Even a local website I use to buy my coins on went down. Nobody could prepare for this after the mainstream media attention.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:29:50
Unless you have experience or lots of money, I would stay away from day trading. Just hold on to it and let it increase in value.
If you work with limit orders, it won't cost you anything. Look up some tutorials on YT.

Don't put everything in BTC. Also wait for a decline, will probably happen in the coming day/week.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:36:34
Yes indeed, banks are still very suspicious when it comes to cryptocurrency, so this could one of the issues. But don't worry, I don't think your money is lost, just stuck somewhere until it is processed.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:53:27
Monero and Vertcoin to the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:17:12
I don't have the patience and time for 'day' trading myself and I also stress out a lot when doing it. I bought a Ledger, put all my coins in and will just wait. And remember, for every successful story there are probably 20 unsuccessful stories. You could try with some lower values to get a feeling for it, but if you expect to make big profits, you'll have to put in bigger values as well.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:03:50
Coinbase is fine, not the best but fine, and GDAX is a good exchange as well. People just do stupid things with big amounts of money. I've done several transactions and trades on this platform without a single problem. Just don't keep your funds on their wallet and try to avoid their support.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:46:24
Depends what you are in for...
If you want to make some quick profits you could sell at a certain limit and buy back in lower. If you are in for long term gains, just hold.
But who knows what happens after 10k? It might shoot up to 12k and beyond, or dip back to 6k... I personally don't recommend too much trading, but that just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:50:49
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:05:55
It will go back down for sure, I'm personally gonna wait a little longer.
And for long term investments, it's never too late :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:43:09
+1 for Vertcoin. Go green!

I think the best way is to start with Coinbase as I have found it to be the most user-friendly.
+ 1. Create and verify an account on Coinbase.
+ 2. Transfer money to your account using bank tranfers (recommend, but slow) or credit card (instantly, high fees).
+ 3. Transfer your fiat money from Coinbase to GDAX, which is an exchange for trading crypto that is owned by Coinbase. You can login using the same credentials and easily transfer the money with the click of a button.
+ 4. Once the money is on GDAX, exchange your fiat for BTC, or one of the other coins that are currently supported on GDAX. You can set a buy limit on which you want to buy for a certain amount of money, look up some tutorials on YT. Looks overwhelming at first, but is pretty easy after a while.
+ 5. Once you have bought x-amount of crypto, transfer it to a digital wallet on which you store it. I recommend a desktop wallet or hardware wallet. Don't leave it on the exchange, because they control your private keys, and should something ever happen to the website, your coins are gone!
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:33:06
Yep, went for a shower thinking I could buy the dip afterwards... nope.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:15:16
It is way too high indeed. Deposit money on your Coinbase account and then switch it over to GDAX, takes only a few seconds and it will eliminate the high fees.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:59:27
Potentially lose 150$ or gain... I dunno, triple that amount? Your choice of course!
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:51:32
Your account should be accessible no matter where you login from. That's why they also have an app right? So you can use it on the go. 
You might get a prompt telling you that a different IP is used from a different location, and might have to verify it using email / text message, but it should cause no issues. (unless stated somewhere in their terms &amp; conditions, not sure)
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:35:58
GDAX is the exchange from Coinbase, you can transfer your money/coins to it using the same login. There you can use it to trade or just keep it there to sell it later on. I do recommend however to put your coins in a wallet on your PC.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:44:19

Nobody can tell when it's going to dip or rise, it's a little like gambling. Best is to buy and hold for long term gains.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:43:24

@_date: 2017-11-16 19:00:19

@_date: 2017-11-29 10:50:26
Spread a little over multiple coins, maybe go 60-70% BTC and the rest in altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:56:47
First you create and verify an account on Coinbase, on which you can deposit money using bank transfer (recommend, but takes a few days) or credit card (instant, but high fees). Then you can login on GDAX (an exchange for crypto/fiat) using the same credentials as Coinbase, because it is owned by them. 
Once on GDAX, you can transfer the money from Coinbase with a single click. Then you'll have to exchange your money to BTC using a limit buy order. Once done, you have your first BTC in your wallet on GDAX!
But don't leave it on the website, should it ever crash or get hacked, your coins are gone because you don't control them. So you'll have to download a desktop/mobile wallet where you can send you bitcoins to and have full control over them.
Once you've setup a wallet you'll get an receive address (long and alphanuleric string) to which you can deposit the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:08:09
What else? I heard bad things about the other exchanges as well.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:11:58

@_date: 2017-11-17 09:15:25
I would start with investing smaller amounts during 'dips', invest what you can miss or can afford to lose. Should you feel more confident after a while, you could increase your investments.
Also, nobody knows what will happen tomorrow, next week... So my best advice is to read and learn as much as you can. I've only started few weeks ago myself, but I've learned so much and feel more confident now.

@_date: 2017-11-19 20:46:27

There are several good ones out there. Heard good things about Coinomi (mobile) and have used Electrum (desktop) in the past which is easy and lightweight.
Recently switched to a hardware wallet, for security reasons. Once you start to invest higher values, I recommend getting one of those.

@_date: 2017-11-28 16:56:52
No problem, I like to help people out :D and yes, it's just a normal transfer which avoids the high fees, but it could take up to 3 days (usually just 1 for me) before the money arrives on your account.

OBS, Xsplit, TinyTake,...
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:14:26
And you wasted hundreds if not thousands of dollars on power consumption. GG.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:05:24
Lol, cringe.

Indeed, they are doing some use cases with IOTA at the moment but I'm sure other technologies and projects will follow! This is great for crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:32:57
Lol, no.

This is the exact same site as: 
Might as well create my own one and place my logo on it.

And this is why heavy PoW isn't sustainable. ��
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:27:46
I get angry each time I see pictures like this. What a fucking waste.
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:04:12
Lmao. Here comes the maximalist miners.
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:00:55
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:05:35
There is indeed so much manupilation going on, this doens't look healthy anymore. I actually hope this shitshow will end soon, and those with actual working and useful tech will eventually flourish while others dry out.

Hodling is a way of life.

Good, PoW has to go.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:54:52
No denying that, but I feel posts like this will only make it worse.
@_date: 2018-11-03 09:39:10
Distributed Ledger Technology is the future. Bitcoin will be surpassed at some point (marketcap-wise, technology-wise it has been surpassed years ago).
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:38:56
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:35:47
What the hell is going on with this massive FUD?!
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:49:26
Yeah, because of all the negative news...
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:39:45
God, stop this crap.
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:10:06
Those posts are so retarded. Damn moon- and lamboboys. Everytime they see a little green they go nuts, expecting some kind of magical bullrun. Please.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:37:44
It's barely profitable anymore to mine with normal hardware, you'll end up with pennies.
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:03:34
Why do you record your monitor? You know there is tons of software that you can use to record your desktop, right?
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:41:33
Personally never had any downtime issues...
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:34:09
Nobody knows. It might skyrocket and be mass adopted. Or it might dry out as other more advanced technologies take over. ��
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:01:12
Yeah, very mature. Nice research you did.
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:07:48
Screw her, she is full of shit.
You can see her body language shift dramatically when asked and talking about IOTA.
First she says she has no financial interests in the whole IOTA affair, then when pressed about her holdings she admits to having a "small amount". Sorry, but her credibility just left the room, a long time ago actually. Attacking other projects without even providing any practical proof.
Game over, there were vested interests in discrediting other projects.

@_date: 2018-07-11 05:40:02
Bitcoin Bull(shit).
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:50:58
No. You can't mine (or at least not profitable) without special hardware.
@_date: 2018-07-01 14:48:43
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:47:59
Mining in general turns people off, but nobody faces it...
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:56:58
Lol, here comes the bullshit articles again.
@_date: 2018-07-06 13:11:28
God, where is my tin foil hat at?!
@_date: 2018-07-07 11:01:09
Yeah, my dog said it will go to $34k.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:28:33
I bet you did buddy. Please, for once, tell me (and others) why this project is a scam? Enlighten me with non-debunked topics, proofs, sources, whatsoever. Please, bring it on. I bet you're going to bring up the same crap all maximalists do. God, this space is fucked, no wonder the world still laughs at crypto.
I'm not here to freaking chill IOTA if you think so, I'm saying she is a disgrace to this space by discrediting other projects without providing actual and practical proof, no matter what project it was, even if it was Bitconnect. She is still full of shit.
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:41:24
Hurts? I love it. 
What a massive waste of resources in one picture.
@_date: 2018-07-11 05:38:44
Yeah, because he probably is invested in it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:09:30
1\- Near free is not free, also wastes **huge** amounts of power...
2\- LN has many disadvantages as well, that \(in my opinion!\) outweigh the advantages.
3\-  China is home to four of the five largest Bitcoin mining pools. Having so much mining power centralized in one country put in doubt decentralization of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:22:40
Nano, LN?
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:02:34
It's manipulation, not moon, idiots.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:29:45
Fool. At least buy something with a brighter future.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:15:43
Not. It's too fucking slow and still a hassle to use. Haha ��
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:57:09
Terrible comparison. Stop trying to compare and justify the tons of energy that goes to waste mining. It's unsustainable whatever way you put it.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:27:56
Care? It still can't scale, it's still fucking slow, it's still wastes a fuckton of energy on solving crypto-puzzles and don't start with 'oh but the LN will solve everything'. No it will not, and everyone who used it should know.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:17:32
Yup, they always ignore this issue or start babbling about how the majority of it is mined on renewable energy jada jada. Still, it's a huge fucking waste of energy and 'money' that could be used on more important things.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:51:05
Environmentalists are not wrong though...

These kind of stores must be running out of business... Can't imagine them having hundreds of visitors buying crypto at ridiculous prices...
@_date: 2018-12-01 05:24:50
I'm hopeful about the future of distributed ledger technology. Bitcoin? Meh, we'll have to see.
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:50:11
What a fucking idiot.
