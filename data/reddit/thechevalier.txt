Thank you.
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:17:13
Yeah, I am the original owner. I bought a few of them after watching "The Bitcoin Show", which had an interview with the creators. I have indeed been around for ahwile. Here's my account on bitcointalk  
I'm pretty sure I can substantiate who I am. But yeah, I get what you're saying. This is part of what makes me think I should just cut the damn thing open.
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:29:21
The trouble is that I don't know how to sell them. I actually have a few others "physical" bitcoins too. I have some 1 BTC Casascius coins and a couple of really obscure silver rounds that have 1 BTC on them.  I thought about grading them to help authenticate them.  
For me they are savings. I ran out of most of my liquid bitcoin and need to dip in, sadly. This is the problem with them. Having the physical coins really helped me not spend them for all this time, but I feel like I'm destroying important historical artifacts. It sucks. On the other hand, I feel incredibly lucky.
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:47:51
Thank you for the advice.

Well, I wasn't.

Surely not every single tweet about Bitcoin tagged  is scathingly negative.
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:40:36
Actually sounds like a backhanded slap to bitcoin. While acknowledging it's benefits he's suggesting it needs to be replaced with something with more "attribution".
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:57:26
Yes.

Neat. I wanna wear my bitcoin paycheck around my neck too!

Fear, uncertainty, doubt. The US govt. has its priorities almost completely backwards. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:38:13
Yes, I feel dumb. Sorry. That should have read, "Because I buy a few bitcoins a week from *Coinbase*.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:16:47
Not particularly rude as far as tone of email or anything like that. But if they are kicking me out, I think it's just common curtesy to tell me why. I have denied running a MSB. They obviously disagree with me. Don't I deserve an explanation for why? They have made quite a bit of money from me over the years and I have been a regular, good customer referring other people to them.
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:31:18
Yes, they are free to stop doing business with me for any reason, AML or otherwise. There's also something called common curtesy and customer service.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:32:32
This is my question. What makes them think that? No answer from them.
@_date: 2014-07-31 00:07:01
That seems weird, because I have had a Coinbase account from the time they first opened, and Bitcoin was worth way less then. As a result, in the past, I would have purchases and sells of 10 or 20 or more at a time. Now I rarely buy or sell more than 2 or 3 a week, if that.
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:34:18
@_date: 2014-07-31 22:06:47
No, not so. They gave me a chance to show my MSB licenses and federal registration as a money transmitter, and to provide them with info about my KYC policies and asked whether I have a department to spy on people.
This crap about how I can prove to them what I did with the money via blockchain records is just speculation. Who knows whether they would accept that kind of thing. It's a naive mode of thinking.
One of the reasons I use bitcoin is for personal financial privacy. I don't want to disclose what I spent bitcoins on or who I give money to. What if I am donating them to Wikileaks after running them through a mixing service? What if I am giving some bitcoins to my girlfriend? How do I prove that she owns a specific address? Why should I have to say what I do with my money, or where it resides?

@_date: 2014-07-31 04:53:09
Yep, I know it's not Coinbase's fault. My only beef with Coinbase is I want them to tell me why they think I'm selling Bitcoins on LocalBitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:58:07
I hate this product and I haven't even seen it in person yet.

I think it's an excellent product. Good customer service too. I just bought a couple titanium wallets from them. Couldn't be more pleased.
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:49:25
Yes, well, any US citizen who has ever sold bitcoin for USD should be afraid. We live in a country that puts a priority on prosecuting victimless crimes.

Coinbase has started doing aggressive cover-their-ass aml/knc investigations of its customers too. If you give them a lot of your business they will eventually accuse you over being a MSB.
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:34:10
Exactly. I always use Starbucks.

Seems odd. Beta is generally a term used inre to testing.
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:36:33
Uh, no I did not say I was a LocalBitcoins trader. They did say "we will be suspending your account." (exact quote). Did you even read the email exchange?
EDIT: Apologies for not including the email they sent me about LocalBitcoins. Here it is: 
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:26:59
Sorry, I forgot to post one of the emails. It's a long thread. Here is where they mention LocalBitcoins: 
What could I have researched? Yes, I "incriminated" myself. I make no bones about having in the past sold some bitcoins. Anyone who has ever sold a bitcoin to another person without going through a special licensed broker like Coinbase is also a criminal, under your definition.

@_date: 2014-07-31 02:37:31
I meant Coinbase, not LocalBitcoins. And a few bitcoins a week is an overestimate. More like a few a month. Some months I don't buy any at all. I've had an account for years.

True. I don't really even have any animosity about the situation. I'm just posting this because I think people should know that if they ever sell even a small amount of their personal bitcoin to another individual for fiat, that companies like Coinbase will consider you poison and distance themselves from you, no matter how great of a customer you have been. In fairness, they probably don't believe they have much of a choice.

No, if you exchange Bitcoin for USD directly with another ordinary person you are in violation of FinCEN's guideline, and therefore Coinbase's policy.
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:36:13
Why is it hard for you to believe that Coinbase is aggressively trying to be compliant within the crappy regulatory environment? 
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:27:22
Agreed. :)

Perhaps op has a chronic medical condition and uses his bitcoins to buy drugs to treat his condition from dark markets... Perhaps op sends money to a mixer as a general precaution in order to preserve his pricacy. Perhaps op send money to Wikileaks or other organizations he does not want anyone to have a record of. Perhaps op buys bitcoin for his his friends or family and has no way to prove they own the addresses he sent them to. Perhaps op uses bitcoin to retain a semblance of financial privacy.

I kinda feel like he's a Szabo is a dead end too. 
Who is he? Has anyone actually met him? Supposedly, he gave the keynote at the IEEE International Workshop on Electronic Contracting (WEC), and my googling shows that he (may) have worked for some defense contractors and electronic payment companies.

Why do you have to trust them? You can send them a BIP-38 encrypted private key. That's what I did.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:34:39
Sorry, I forgot to include the email in which they mention LocalBitcoins: 
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:42:49
I do? Since when?
@_date: 2014-08-02 02:43:15
I agree with just about everything you say. 
Except, retaining privacy (financially) is not equivalent to money laundering.
Bitcoin is such a lowly vehicle for money laundering that it doesn't really merit this kind of attention from the govt. The bitcoin market cap is under $10 billion, while the drug industry does something like $300+ billion per year in transactions. Laundering is a job only the big banks can really handle. We Bitcoin users are just being harassed.
@_date: 2014-07-31 00:02:09
The amount of BTC I was buying was very low in my estimate. A few per month (maybe like 5 in one month max). I also regularly buy small amounts on Coinbase ($5-20 worth) to pay for things in bitcoin conveniently, e.g.: domain name registrations and small purchases from Newegg. I like to transact in Bitcoin whenever I can and I found Coinbase very convenient for that.
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:57:11
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:54:04
Isn't LocalBitcoins pseudonymous? Short of sending out an agent to entrap sellers, what evidence could they have that someone is selling bitcoins there? I don't believe it's really their business to know whether I'm doing business there, whether they think it is or not. I'm still waiting for Coinbase to show me any evidence that I am doing so. I don't believe they have any. I don't want to deny it. I don't want to confirm it.
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:45:03
I don't have any bitcoin on coinbase. I move bitcoin there to sell it, and sometimes I buy bitcoin and either spend it immediately, or send it to one of my other wallets. I don't trust online wallets.
@_date: 2014-07-31 00:09:47
How do I back my position? I don't really have any position other than I am perturbed they are going around the Interwebs snooping on me and accusing me of being a seller on LocalBitcoins without any evidence.
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:41:57
I'm closer to the latter demographic.
That kind of possibility is what I'm concerned about (tagging).

I just thought it would be of interest. The idea of "virtual coins" is catching on. Sure, it's not really the same thing as a currency (digital chotskies redeemable for hamburgers or whatever) but these concepts being popularized by big marketing machines will be a *good thing* for Bitcoin. So are other, albeit lame, digital currencies such as MintChip.

That's all well and good as long as Tor isn't connected to the rest of the Internet. If you can see the flow into Tor and the flow out of Tor, simple math lets you correlate them.
@_date: 2011-08-26 07:18:11
How could he have known that Bitcoin was going to actually be worth so much? Obviously he(?) was a genius, but are we also supposed to believe he was precognitive?
There's lots of speculation about Satoshi having mined tons of Bitcoin when the difficulty was low, but is there really any evidence for that or is it simply speculation?
The idea that he's keeping a low profile to avoid retribution from the govt. makes some sense, but on the other hand, do you think a guy as smart as he is would be naive enough to think the govt. couldn't track him down if they really wanted to?
@_date: 2011-08-28 01:08:22
You make a good point. The Truecrypt guys are anonymous too.
Of course, I'm also suspicious of the Truecrypt origin story. :P
@_date: 2011-07-13 01:35:59
Really balanced piece.
@_date: 2011-08-29 05:14:04
Yes, I agree with this line of reasoning. Personally, I don't think there's a hidden vulnerability in the protocol itself, although I'm sure there are ways to manipulate the entire market (but that's true of any market). So that leaves us with option one.
Who cares? I dunno. Ultimately it probably does not really matter *who* unleashed Bitcoin. It has a life of its own now. But I am very interested in the motive. Knowing why Bitcoin came about may shed light on all sorts of things...
What could the goal possibly be? Again, I don't know. Obviously, the technology is disruptive. How disruptive remains to be seen. Maybe it's part of a bigger plan. Maybe it's groundwork for something else. Maybe the goal is to create some sort of reaction. I dunno.
@_date: 2011-08-27 04:58:46
Interesting! Why?
@_date: 2011-08-26 06:09:01
I don't have a conspiracy theory formulated (yet). That's kind of why I posed this question.
The difference between the airplane example and Bitcoin is that the Wright brothers didn't package up their finished work and give it to the world as an altruistic gift. In fact they spent their entire lives trying to take credit for inventing manned flight. Geniuses who invent game-changing technology certainly exist, but they usually like to take credit for it.
@_date: 2011-08-26 07:30:35
Yeah. Someone appears out of nowhere, single-handedly drops a bombshell technology on the internet that creates a whole new industry and challenges the existing financial system, and then disappears off the face of the Earth. It seems a bit odd to me.
@_date: 2011-08-28 01:04:58


Yeah, I don't really want to believe that.
@_date: 2011-08-31 07:40:26
Kind of a weird angle on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-08-18 18:56:15
I'd be really surprised if Bitcoin.com didn't have links to the official Bitcoin project when their new services finally roll out. It's in Tradehill's best interest to get as many people involved in BTC as possible.
@_date: 2011-08-26 17:04:22
I stand corrected about the date of the first publicly available Bitcoin code. However, the code in those early distributions comes without any history. Was it all written by a single person, Satoshi? Is that credible? Was there a dev team before the SoureForge project was set up? If so, who was involved and how did they collaborate? 
I can't even look at the original code because bitcoin-0.1.0.rar doesn't seem to be available anymore. Anyone have a link to a copy?
@_date: 2011-08-27 05:48:02
Well, [it's pretty well established]( the NSA is sucking it all in. I disagree that monitoring encrypted traffic is mostly useless. Encrypted web traffic is probably a relatively small amount of the total traffic on the Internet; while still massive, it's susceptible to all sorts of traffic analysis and side-channel leakage. SSL, PGP and other public key crypto systems are very vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Even if the algorithms aren't crackable, they have ways of listening to you talk. But before people put too much faith in these encryption schemes, they should realize that the NSA's technology for signals intelligence and cryptography is probably a decade or more ahead of what's available (or even known) to the public. If you do become a target, you're not going to avoid the NSA and DIA with things like PGP and Tor. The best thing is probably not to become a target in the first place.
@_date: 2011-07-09 01:00:08
Which is lame.
But you could use it as a second factor with a password manager like LastPass and be just as secure. Actually, considering Mt. Gox's security record I'd rather do that than trust them to implement two factor auth correctly.

Maybe, maybe not. People expend massive amounts of time and energy on hobby projects and labors of love.
@_date: 2011-08-27 06:47:46

I'm sure they are somewhat selective about what they store, but I wouldn't underestimate their resources. These agencies have astronomical budgets and advanced technology. I've read, for instance, that back in the 1970s the NSA was able to record and store every single international phone conversation.
@_date: 2011-08-26 16:35:20
I didn't say he doesn't exist. I believe Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym and the original Bitcoin author's true identity, motives, etc. remain unknown.
@_date: 2011-08-26 07:02:26
Why? 
[Notice the date on the first commit]( It's on August 30, 2009 by "sirius-m" (who is also ["retired"]( not by Satoshi. Note there is also a slight date/time discrepancy between the Git repo and the Subversion repo. But let's chock that up to git-svn, or whatever was used to migrate the repository.
The "genesis block" was established on January 3, 2009 and the first publicly available code was released roughly *seven months* later. AFAICT, there's not a lot of information about what was happening with Bitcoin during that time or before, other than the appearance of bitcoin.org, which seems to have been registered (initially) for the express purpose of publishing the Satoshi's very short paper, ["Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"](
@_date: 2011-09-03 20:14:48
Sigh. From the [Tor FAQ](
*[S]uppose the attacker controls or watches the Tor relay you choose to enter the network, and also controls or watches the website you visit. In this case, the research community knows no practical low-latency design that can reliably stop the attacker from correlating volume and timing information on the two sides.*
@_date: 2011-08-26 16:42:33
Yeah, I think certain agencies of the govt. could if they *really* wanted to. I believe they capture practically every single packet sent through the Internet and can use forensics to reconstruct activity. The also have practically unlimited resources and can be completely unscrupulous. They may have made secret advances in factoring that make PKI and PGP tractable decryption problems if a target merits the attention. Yes, I am somewhat paranoid.
@_date: 2011-08-28 00:03:14
I think you're assuming *way* to much about me. I know about Austrian economics and monetary policy. I consider Bitcoin quite revolutionary.
@_date: 2011-08-27 06:40:46
Sure. But doesn't that imply he knew it likely *would* challenge the existing financial system. Who (or which group of people) would be so worried or *certain* that Bitcoin would wreck havoc?
But maybe it really was just a single genius guy toiling away in secret--because he knew how disruptive his technology would become, and knew there was a likelihood that it would take off bigtime--and so he worked alone patiently until he had a fully-formed masterpiece ready to go. Then, after anonymously bestowing it upon the world, he returned to his Batcave to work on his next invention... or retired to his Bitcoin vault to swim in a mountain of Bitcoins like Scrooge McDuck. Oops... I've fallen into sarcasm, sorry.
Seriously though, you might be totally right. 
What makes me suspicious, though, is in my experience technologies like this tend to come about in more iterative way, with many people involved, vetting the design and implementation and experimenting with proof of concepts, testing, etc. And I have a real hard time believing that this technology didn't as well. And that in turn makes me think Bitcoin was a project developed over a longer time than we've been told, and probably by many more people. Who would do so and why I don't know exactly.

If the NSA (or other intelligence agencies) can monitor the entirety of the Tor network, then Tor is not going to keep you anonymous from them. If they are indeed doing that, then, like you say, they would not tip their hand in some court case.

Well, again, I'm still cooking it up. I'm interested in possible intelligence agency (governmental or otherwise) involvement in Bitcoin and other crypto systems, such as Truecrypt, that have shadowy 
provenance... e.g.: appearing fully formed out of the ether, authored by anonymous individuals.
I think people get upset about this topic because they feel that if the story of Bitcoin's orgin is fake, there has to be something wrong with Bitcoin itself. That's not true.

I had the exact same thought a few weeks ago.
 I've been thinking about this a lot. Seems like we could also make our own "bit bills" with something like moo cards. 
Maybe have the private key printed in a QR code and fold the card in half to keep it obscured? It could function as a form of paper backup.
If it were possible to easily verify that a Bitcoin was still good without revealing the private key it could even be used for transactions.
Still pondering...

Well, all I know is that trying to share truecrypt containers across multiple machines with Dropbox results in multiple conflicting copies of the file.

Seems cool...
*SpiderOak uses a layered approach to encryption, using a combination of 2048 bit RSA and 256 bit AES.*
*Most importantly, however, the outer level keys are never stored plaintext on the SpiderOak server. They are encrypted with 256 bit AES, using a key created by the key derivation/strengthening algorithm PBKDF2 (using sha256), with 16384 rounds, and 32 bytes of random data ("salt"). This approach prevents brute force and pre-computation or database attacks against the key. This means that a user who knows her password, can generate the outer level encryption key using PBKDF2 and the salt, then decipher the outer level keys, and be on the way to decrypting her data. Without knowledge of the password, however, the data is quite unreadable.*

None of this shit has been tested in court inre Bitcoins, and it is not clear how the guidance will be applied to small time guys like me who don't have any capacity to launder substantial amounts of money. Yes, it seems clear as to the definition of who qualifies as being considered a money transmitter by FinCEN (from the guidance) but it is not clear what the implications of that are. It's a mess. You are considered a money transmitter if you sell .01 BTC for USD without a license, but in most states it's impossible to get a license unless you are a corporation or an LLC. These laws are designed to deal with money laundering. Generally, MSBs are not even required to report transactions under $1000. It's not clear whether FinCEN even gives a crap about small, person-to-person transactions, whether the seller is considered a money transmitter or not. You need to stop playing lawyer. Unless you have a bunch of case law to show off, you're just spreading a bunch of FUD.
It's very tiresome to have you keep calling me a criminal. I am not a criminal (period).

Well, platinum doesn't really have much of a history as a monetary metal, so I doubt I'll be able to barter with it in a SHTF scenario. Silver's industrial applications are also much broader and more numerous than platinum's, and silver's price is ridiculously low right now due to manipulation in the fake paper silver market (ETFs).

Yeah, although I think Casascius coins probably fall in the "exonumia" category rather than coin category... not sure how must more valuable tokens, etc., with errors on them are than from tokens without. In the world of govt. issued coins, I know errors are highly prized.
With gold coins the numismatic value tends to get compressed as the price of gold goes up. So, for instance, a first run American Gold Eagle isn't worth that much more than a 2013 Gold Eagle, even the first run proof AGEs aren't worth that much more.

The nice thing about silver is that the *best case* scenario (and most likely) is world-wide economic growth. There isn't really a good substitute for it industrially, everyone needs it and there isn't enough of it. It's a great hedge against regular old inflation. In the case of a hyperinflation, it could be one of the the best things to barter with. That being said, it's not a bad idea to own some guns and ammo as well.
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:05:30
It certainly is not a crime to engage in anonymous or semi-anonymous financial transactions. Anonymous does not equate to illegal.
Liberty Reserve is a red herring. a) The guy running LR has a previous conviction for operating an illegal financial business and fled to Costa Rico while still on probation, b) He continued operate and expand LR (and several other related businesses) after he was denied a Costa Rican licence to operate a money transmitting business in 2011, c) LR has long been associated with transactions involving criminals and hackers, and d) it was the Costa Rican authorities that initiated an investigation, not the US Treasury.

Why the downvote? Isn't this interesting? It means that the market is so tight that people are willing to buy them through a crappy channel like eBay for large premiums over Mt.Gox price. That's a Bitcoin *cent* (.01) going for $2.25. Whole Bitcoins are selling for well over $100. This is an indicator of how much buy pressure there is and bodes well for the price to keep rising for awhile.

I don't think what's going on on eBay with Bitcoin is that well known. It's crazy. People are selling their **preorders** for BFL hardware for thousands. Original 1 BTC Casascius coins are going for over $500. The new ones are going for as much as $200. People are selling Bitcoin in tiny denominations for big bucks, etc.

One of the great features of bitcoin is that it can be transferred internationally cheaply and directly. It would be great if we could send bitcoins to someone on the ground in the Philippines actually providing direct relief to people. There are always small groups like that.

Remember, the FINCEN thing is a *guidance*, not a law, and Bitcoin has not been established in court to be a currency.
I certainly was not laundering money as I had no idea that the funds were stolen (there was no intent). Secondly, nobody was damaged except me, as all of the funds were repatriated to their original owner.
That being said, I certainly do not want to run afoul of the law.

Maybe I should have prefaced by saying: **In no way do I endorse buying or selling BTC on eBay** *this is strictly for informational purposes*!
Yeah, it's not a good way to buy BTC. That's kind of my point tho... I think this shows how much pressure there is on the buy side.
As for this risks, I can see why some sellers would be willing to take a chance selling Bitcoin "cents" or "dimes", especially if they picked up their BTC when it was say $10. It's not a huge risk, especially if you're the gambling, speculating type -- which, BTW, I am not, and do not advise anyone to sell BTC on eBay under *any circumstances*.

I do see it from their perspective. I'm sure things are tough for them. And it's totally their prerogative to sacrifice customer satisfaction and throw me under the bus in order to appear proactive about fraud and compliance with the law. However, I don't want to do business with any company that treats its customers so poorly, and I don't think most people realize how unreasonable and heavy handed Dwolla can be. That's one reason I posted about it. I'm shocked! But ultimately, I'm glad to get rid of my Dwolla account for this reason.
The other thing is, I don't think most people realize how unfriendly Dwolla has become towards Bitcoin. They have a "zero tolerance" policy about "peer to peer" (meaning one Dwolla user to another) exchanges of Bitcoin for Dwolla. Yet, they haven't really spelled that out or even really done much to make customers aware of that policy. The only thing I could find is a new section in their ToS about the recent FINCEN guidance concerning virtual currencies. Apparently, they are expecting that to telegraph the information about their "zero tolerance" policy (without spelling out or defining Bitcoin, peer-to-peer, virtual currency, zero tolerance, etc.).
And there is the issue of Dwolla damaging me. It's one thing to close my account, but to go around to other companies and get them to take action against me, is something else entirely. I'm still trying to determine how and with what justification Dwolla was able to clawback money from CampBX.

I'm sorry, but that is some serious BULLSHIT.

No, it's reversible. Don't use it.

Why didn't you do capacity planning ahead of time? Do you guys just not have enough money to buy servers and bandwidth? You guys have been around for four years, it seems like you should have been ready for this latest boom/bust cycle.
