I have driven 60k miles on new rotors and pads on my 1996 civic and then i sold it pads and rotors still had a bit life left and tires were also good and i didnt need to replace them yet. 
It just depends on your driving style, i rarely use the brakes, look far ahead andlet the vehicle roll out instead of braking and downshifting also helps to use less brakes and on the highway you also dont need the brakes only in emergencies and i drive alot of highway. 
For a track car its different obviously but thats not a daily driver

People driving 200k + on a set of brake pads. 50k they even last on a normal car

60k miles in 1,5 years max 2 years the tires where not old and the car was checked regulary by a good mechanic.
