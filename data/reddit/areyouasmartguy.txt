My only regret is that I dont have any extra fiat to turn into bitcoin today.

one of those whats the point of making money if you dont get attention/status from it guys I guess
what a douche tool

Good question.
I don't invest huge amounts of money. Like 100 dollars at a time usually of extra money. I only buy when its just extra money that would go to video games eating out or whatever. Never more than I'm willing to lose. 
I think the assumption when people talk about buying bitcoin is they are spending like 100k$ at all times or whatever. I would hope the amount of people like me that aren't high rollers increases over time.

about last april I spent my .5 btc because I believed in btc and by the time I had money again to put in my wallet btc was at 17k. I just thought I had a few years before it got this big. Bittersweet I guess.
 its gonna take me years to get it back to that if ever. I doubt I will ever own a full btc. I wont give up though.

I don't really know. I just buy whenever I have extra money despite what the price is. I'm not smart enough about bitcoin to try and play the market. I just in particular wish I had money today.

thanks so much
I was more worried about my math than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:11:55
the worst thing is I don't have any extra fiat to buy btc
I want to buy the dip so bad and cant

I just watched that video like 5 minutes ago.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:48:01
because its less of a risk 
less chance of 10x or 100x but also less chance of going completely bust
its up to you what to do with your 10k$ if you are ok with making an even bigger gamble than btc then go into other crypto

our president is so shit that the morale is down and we need a boost so he made this thread

tried to send money today
is 0.00036 total fee for 226 bytes total about right ? or is that too low ? or do you need more info ? 
I thought I did the math right that I sent it about 160 satoshi per byte but Im nervous I did something wrong.
in general how long should this transfer take ? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:56:00
I cant figure out how to set my own price for fee in bitcoin core. It confuses me since it uses bitcoin numbers instead of the satoshi per byte itself like Ive seen in other wallets. I feel really stupid.

personally I really like Doug Polk's crypto youtube channel as I trust him to be non  biased. Im sure theres more knowledgeable people out there on the tech side of things but his content is great,hes funny,and most importantly hes a credible source (in my opinion from knowing his poker channel/training site where he always ran everything with integrity in a space where its easy to screw people over). He just gives out information without shilling things or telling you what to invest in.

we dont fuck with bitconnect thats that bernie madoff
god damn
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:01:03
We should stop using it. 
But bitcoin is far bigger than this subreddit or the amount of people who will know to stop using it. And most wont want to because of the convenience of it.

he had me at digital gold and then the nas stillmatic reference sold the deal
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:34:11
why do they keep reopening when Im asleep this sucks
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:14:53
It is fine if you believe in bitcoin long term and followed the  rule of crypto.
 Never invest more than you are willing to lose. Bitcoin is high risk high reward. I think its a really great thing to get into but if you've invested so much you are in a panic situation you've done something wrong.

Some guy on instagram reached out to me and wanted to see if I wanted to invest in bitcoin alongside him.
Did you get scammed? Yes
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:01:26
I know it was perfect right?
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:20:47
is it a good or bad idea to increase fee that may be too low in a bitcoin core transaction thats unconfirmed after about 2 hours ?
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:38:47
but did I screw up by increasing it ? I just want it to go through
