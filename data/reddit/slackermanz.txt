Yes, I would give it an above-average 8/10. Was mostly objective, though I would say it had a minor bias. Not to concerning, or discrediting levels, though. 
It doesn't cover anything after Jan 1, 2014 though - the year bitcoin was the one of, if not *the* worst performing of any semi-recognised asset.
The underlying technology was, and remains reliable and heavily innovative.
If anyone has a curiosity, I feel this would be enough to propel them through the "I've heard of it, but don't trust it" stage, in most cases. Good luck getting a non-fanatic to watch it, though.

*Oh. In that case, let's not worry at all. Clearly no preventative measures are required.*
Are you *really* suggesting that you know the future, and that we should ignore a systematic threat to Bitcoin?
That level of naivety and apathy is what allowed this issue to arise.

That sounds like forking the technological evolutionary process..

We could instead create configuration-transparent pools and pay people to mine them. Miners follow the money.

Am I correct in assuming that when using Armory, change addresses are handled automatically, and I am not at risk of sending a transaction with a fee in the thou$ands?

Bitcoin is currently inflating at ~10% per year. We **are** pouring money into the system. All of us.

Please include filters for different countries! Many of the retailers likely do not serve all countries worldwide, but I'd like to know which ones can distribute to NZ, for example.

New Zealand.
Late 2013: Most people have not heard of bitcoin, those I told thought it was a scam. It was scary and dodgy as hell to them. Also, "Ew, free money" when I offered $5.
Mid 2014: Almost everyone I mention it to has heard of it, although a lot of misconceptions exist. Isn't the CEO dead? ^(I honestly thought this was an joke.. maybe not) 
Also, they now typically accept a free $5 without hesitation, at least on Android phones. I've probably handed out $100+ in the last two months. Worth it.

Right, so all of this happens in the absence of the blockchain, correct?

No, I think I could trade my fiat for BTC at a better rate than the rate chosen entirely at random by an employer.
At worst, my attempts would be just as random as theirs; at best I get more BTC for the same fiat value.

I used the Armory downloader to get my core software, so I'm running bitcoin-qt (bitcoin-0.9.3-linux)
And there's definitely no hanging, just a simple crash. The '.armory/databases' folder is always left 100% empty.
Okay, I ran it via terminal to get the raw error outputs. This fun ends in a *Segmentation fault (core dumped)* which I understand to be an attempt at over-allocation of resources.
**[~20,000 lines of errors]**

No, I do not have enough space on the SSD. ~24GB is left. I'm running armory from my 2TB storage drive via terminal with
    armory --datadir="/media/username/HDD_name/FolderName/.armory/"
Perhaps it is to do with my distro? Could there be an issue running 14.04 Xubuntu 64 bit on an Intel i5 2500k?
Also, what do you think the chances are of this being a result of some hardware failure? This machine is a bit overused and the hardware (including CPUs, HDD &amp; SSD) seems to have miscellaneous failures from time to time.

I think I have a solution, and have finished scanning the chainstate and have begun scanning the blocks themselves.
[This was the post containing the command line addition I required.](
Final sequence was the two commands combined:
    armory --datadir="/media/username/HDD_Name/ArmoryFolderName/.armory/" --satoshi-datadir="/media/username/HDD_Name/BitcoinCoreFolderName/.bitcoin/"
Thanks for the help!

This idea *is* really cool. Autonomous mobile devices like drones could refuel based on their 'personal' earnings, gained by providing services.
