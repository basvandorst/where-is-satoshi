We're not concerned about returning customers (our products are really good), but moreso interested in gaining new customers.

Great idea! Added bitcoin logo to the bottom of our page.

omki2005, appreciate the support.  Thank you!

I would agree with you, but we garnered a lot of interest from Bitcoin users on Black Friday.  I know there's more hemp loving Bitcoin users out there! :)

Just got your order -- thank you!  You'll love the lotion.  Definitely leaves your skin very moist and help clears up skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, acne and dry skin.  
Any idea of the type of product you'd like to see?  We're thinking of adding a hemp hair gel/pomade.  Pretty tough to add guys product lines since hair and bath products are generally fawned over by women more than men. But men possess Bitcoins...Catch 22.

More than happy to plug away, but just don't want to wear out our welcome. :)

High quality lotions help reduce chaffing on certain *ahem* body parts.

That's a really good idea.  I wouldn't see why we couldn't do that.  Would you prefer a soap or gel?

That's great to hear! Glad she loves it.

The "Hemp" scents are unscented.  The smell is comprised of the hemp seed oil that goes into the product.

I'm not quite familiar with Gyft aside from the ads I've seen on r/Bitcoin.  I'll make sure to check into you.  Thank you for the ideas -- you guys have been great.

Great idea, thank you.

I've registered on the website bitcoin black Friday website.  I also have very dry soon -- the hemp lotion does wonders!

I have, but I get this error when I specifically try to target r/Bitcoin with the maximum date ranges:
"We have insufficient inventory to fulfill your requested budget, target, and dates. Only 3,367 impressions available on Bitcoin from 12/12/2013 to 03/13/2014. Maximum budget is $2.52."

Stay tuned for another post in the future when we come out with hemp shaving soap/gel. :)
