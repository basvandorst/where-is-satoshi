But the government’s interest payments are not even 5% of GDP.

Zero evidence for this tired conspiracy theory.

I honestly feel pretty bad for you, living with so much fear.

But it isn’t, because Austrian “economics” is a religion, not a academic theory. Austrians began with the assumption that human beings behave rationally and postulate from there. Austrian beliefs are completely untestable and in fact the “school” rejects the idea of econometrics and hypothesis testing entirely. It’s not a science and not worthy of being taken seriously.

...has absolutely nothing to do with Keynesianism.

You can put it in T-bills, the world's most liquid and safest asset.

It's fun to see you bitcoiners finally begin to understand the problems with deflationary hard currency.

£6 million into $6 million is a loss of 22%. Seems just right for Bitcoin.

Private entity? All profit the Fed earns is returned to the Federal treasury.

You are comparing apples and oranges. The sum of all debt is a "stock." It's a fixed amount, a picture in time. Annual GDP is a "flow," a measure of all activity in a period of time. GDP is the annual product of all American assets. These assets are worth hundreds upon hundreds of trillions, far more than total debt.

This is comedy gold.

Debt doesn't need to vanish. A healthy level of debt promotes economic growth. Debt is a tool, not something to be feared.

This is a poorly-informed comment. You forget that assets also produce a return, one that is expected to exceed the rate of interest on associated debt.

Sure is, and it remains family-controlled. They own a majority of voting shares.

What? Wrong. Sinclair is run by a single very conservative family.

Bitcoin has close to zero use beyond buying illegal goods on the darknet. Everything else that Bitcoin does can be done faster, simpler, and cheaper using existing systems.
