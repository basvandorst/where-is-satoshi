Similar to the way people find places that accept Bitcoin

What would happen if a government began to accept Bitcoin for taxes, but with the qualifications that the payment can not trace it's parentage back to a wallet address that is on some black list? Would the standard Bitcoin implementation accept a change that implemented a black list excluder?
So think of it like this: bitcoins are used by some seditious organization to pay for their operations. Eventually the government comes to know a wallet address that was used by the seditious organization and says no payments can be made to the government unless the money has been reverified. The reverified process is simply providing the physical details of the transaction. So to pay my water bill I have to say I got the Bitcoin from my employer as wage. My employer says he got the money for services rendered to some other business (which works closely with the seditious organization) the other business has the choice of forfeiting all funds that have been contaminated by seditious transactions or giving up the seditious organization.

I would watch out for the Federal reserve using the [embrace extended extinguish]( strategy. Watch out for recommended changes for compliance with financial laws

They are hoping that the number of transactions they can include will be greater than the reductions in fees.

I have to challenge you on the claim that maintain forwards compatibility is cheaper than free; unless you mean socially then yes it is easier to get acceptance for a change if you play down the fact that the new code will rejected blocks generated by the old code, or maybe I don't understand soft forks could you provide me with an example?

You know I've always wondered about that. Does it violate the no FTL communication stuff or could you swap around entanglement with only half of the entangled pairs. I figured we would be working on ansibles with a finite number of transmissions if this was possible

To bad for BIP-66. With BIP-66 it sounds like "soft fork are any forks that have been approved from on high, but virtually all soft forks are simply assigning meaning to a meaningless subset of valid transactions". Without BIP-66 soft forks would have a cleaner definition

Sorry misunderstood. It's clear now. Soft fork the hash power to the subset grows. Hard fork the hash power to the superset grows.
Soft fork the network has a negligible chance of producing a contention block
Hard fork the network has a non negligible chance of producing a contentious block

Srr wrong comment

So increasing the maximum block size is a soft fork because the new code could still generate block smaller than the old limit, but creating a minimum block size greater than an old upper limit would be a hard fork because the new code will always generate a block that will be rejected by the old code

Why couldn't the BU buyer turn around and propagate the transaction on the core network?
@_date: 2017-03-12 03:23:10
But not all blocks generated by the older code nodes are acceptable to the newer code. Right? So a soft fork is just a reversed hard fork right?

I was confused by your definition of BIP-66.
