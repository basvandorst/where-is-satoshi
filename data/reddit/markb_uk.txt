99% of these coins are total shit though and despite being cheap and ripe for a pump n dump have no use.

My fellow subjects of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, otherwise know as the United Kingdom. It is clear that the pound is going to take another spanking, with a little forward planning this can easily become a big positive for your wealth. At this moment in time you should be ditching sterling, investment it to bitcoin would be quite prudent, also gold and UK listed companies which have large foreign earnings. 
With a little forward thinking Brexit could become one hell of a opportunity.

In 1992 our small and isolated country got first VHS video player for many days and nights people would come look in wonder at it, some people would come every day and men of government would say 'go home to your wife, you've looked long enough' sometimes even a fight would break out, this happen for many weeks and even years later people would still come to see the wonderful machine. It wasn't until many years later that a foreign man came to our small country and told us that if you put in a special type of cassette tape you can see past things and over on a TV, at first people did not believe him and they tied him up and took him to the 'house of elders', the elders were very angry and set punishment at 100 lashes of bamboo, however the man have VHS tape of 'Smokey and the Bandit' show the whole people. Much excitement followed. And a new law was made to stop people racing their oxen in reckless fashion a man even died trying to jump a old broken wooden bridge on a yak.

Most starvation is by design, it is just another weapon of war. 1) Sanctions against countries only hurt the poor, the rich just pay more but still get food and medicine. 2) Western backed governments (esp in Africa) use starvation as a weapon, a starving population will not physically be capable of revolution. The death of the World Bank, IMF, US Dollar and other fiat currencies will help in ending this horror.

Hi OP. Thank you for sharing this.
To anyone else in a similar situation please remember that you had the intelligence and foresight to see the potential of bitcoin years before anyone else. 
What is not to say that you can't do the same again but with some other technology. 
I was born in the seventies. So far I've been through the the mainstream adoption of PC's, Electronic Payment Systems (VISA etc,), Mobile Phones, Budget Air Travel, Internet, E-Commerce, Smartphones, GPS/Sat Nav and I'm sure I've missed a few.
Even over the next decade they will be technologies created that make everything that has come before seem old fashioned, outdated and boring.
Around 2000 I had quite a few shares in a uk internet company called Freeserve, they didn't seem to be going anywhere so I sold them and bought a pinball machine.... Not long after the price skyrocketed. I was young and foolish but learned a important lesson.
Also I would suggest that it is much better to make your worst fuck-up's in your 20's when you've got plenty of time ahead of you than to make amends than to start making major fuck-up's in your 60's. Which I see all the time.
Take care folks!

Bitcoin is not the panacea to all ills in the world, gold coins (ideally UK minted sovereigns) and tinned food would be great investments too. Bottled water, camping stove, quality warm clothes, basic tools and fuel would also be great.

Even if you are right and the UK goes totally to shit, then one thing will be guaranteed, there will be capital controls to stop money/wealth leaving the UK. If this happens if you own property/gold/stocks/cash you will be stuck, with bitcoin you can simply book a flight and leave taking your wealth with you and there will be nothing anyone can do about it.

Don't worry my wise friend, yes their will be some pain for a year or two, during these times Bitcoin will preserve your purchasing power and wealth. However once the dust settles the UK will be in a much stronger position than that of mainland Europe which for the last 10 years has done nothing but kick the can down the road or extend and pretend regarding some of the fundamental problems with the Euro and the wider European economy in general. When the EU ship sinks the UK will be protected by a 23 mile wide moat, our currency problems will have resolved themselves and we will be in a strong position to do business not only with mainland Europe but also the rest of the world (esp. the commonwealth and North America). 
There are many occasions in life where some short term pain is required for the greater long term good. As mentioned already IMO bitcoin will be a great way to mitigate against the initial discomfort of Brexit.

Good post. I too have thought about what you have posted above and can sum in one sentence.
**People enjoy their servitude**
The longer version might be..
Most people are slaves who are given an illusion of freedom. You have the choice to be free but this comes with great responsibility, most people would rather be on the plantation and outsource their responsibilities to the state. This will ultimately mean that they are poor and in debt but will also have a guaranteed minimum standard of living and are able to watch 8 hours of TV per day.

The EU will try to 'punish' the UK as a deterrent to other countries who might want to leave. This will most likely be an effort to crash the GBP, causing inflation and and therefore higher interest rates, this will in turn put the UK economy in to a deep recession. 
One way to hedge against this would be to have some bitcoin.

Instead of having 'ordinary' people elected to rule over you, power is given to people who are deemed 'experts' in their field. Usually Big Brother knows best types who operate with disdain for the general population. 
Often what is perceived by the technocrats as correct is usually best for the technocrats and a disaster for normal people, i.e with austerity the IMF will class what the technocrats have done as being a great success whilst vast numbers of people lose their jobs, are made homeless and some may even commit suicide.

I am prepared to make a bold statement which I will stand by forever..... Without a single debt, a single currency will never work. It will be doomed from the beginning.  It was dead before it was born, etc, etc. Unless the countries of the Euro consolidate all their debt into one big lump of debt (which will never, never happen) them the Euro is a dead man walking.

For anyone who cares about democracy Brexit was really the only option, forget all the nonsense about immigration or racism. The simple question was do you want to live in a democracy or a technocracy. I value the fact that collectively we have the power to both elect and eject our representatives in parliament, unfortunately the EU is only a pseudo-democracy and all the power lies in a unelected commission, with your MEP's merely being there to collect a massive wage and expenses and give the impression that democracy is happening.
The more people research the set up at the EU the better, no democracy is perfect but what they have in Brussels is as far away from a democracy as you can get whilst still (just about) being able to legally say that it is a democracy. This is the stuff of banana republics not the birthplace of civilised society.

If we take Coinbase as an example for general adoption of bitcoin, they currently have [9.4 million users](
Recently they've been gaining 150,000-200,000 new users per week! So if we take the 150,000 figure they will have over 12 million users by the end of 2017. 
This means that their users will have increase by more than 25% in 3 months. If the relationship between price and users was linear you may expect a 25% increase in price. However due to the hodlers out their the supply of bitcoin is much more limited than what most people think, therefore in order for these 25% to acquire bitcoin the price needs to rise to a level where people will be prepared to sell. However most people won't sell (unless they are desperate for the money) as they know their bitcoins will be worth much more if they hodl for a few more months.

All central banks are politicised, some much more than others.
The Bank Of England is NOT separate from .gov The chancellor can no longer set the interest rate, instead he/she now has to phone the BofE governor up and tell them what the interest rate should be, this is called central bank independence!
One of the great things for me about BTC is that it can't be rigged (at the moment) like the gold, silver, LIBOR, FX, equity and bond markets have been shown to be. Long may BTC be free from the corruption of world politics and central banks.

The basic premise is that the price does not increase in linearity to the number of users. If it did then if the number of users doubled the price would double, this is clearly not true.
I try to calculate the number of users historically, presently and in the future and work out how user adoption affects the price.
I'll be honest here.... I've assumed that user adoption between now and xmas carries on on the same pace as the last few months, TBH these figures could end up being conservative.

Notice the size of the derivatives market, this is why gold is not $10,000 an oz. they can make a derivative of gold and sell it as though it was the real thing to manipulate the price lower. 
They could in theory do the same with Bitcoin and set the price to pretty much what ever they wanted.
There is only one was to stop this, that is to demand physical delivery. In the case of gold it would be actually taking deliver of the gold and storing it yourself, in the case of bitcoin it is **holding your own private key.**

Central bankers target 2-3% inflation. This means 2-3% more oil burnt, plastics made, cars on the road, etc, etc every year. Compounded this means that in order to maintain growth our consumption must double every 25-30 years. Clearly this is not sustainable.
Now I am no SJW environmentalist, but it is obvious to anyone with a brain that we can't continue this trend much longer, a period of stagnation and recession is due in a big way. This however will cause great problems for the FIRE sector, eg pensions need 7% growth per year to keep to their projections, the property market needs capital gains almost every year else it collapses and takes the banks along with it.
These are very interesting times to be alive. It is going to be great to see how bitcoin plays out in all of the coming chaos.

tmosely on ZeroHedge for one... sad that so many people fell for this scam.
I myself nearly did, it was very convincing. The hype at the time was to convert all of one coin to the other as only once coin will win in the end, the first few rounds looked like going to BCH, however at the beginning of Dec 18 the knock out blow was given. It is clear from the charts that this is when they stopped propping up the price. IMO BCH will slowly wither to less than $100.

@_date: 2019-02-09 15:01:15
In the last few months I have reached the following conclusion... 
At the minute personal tax levels are at breaking point. i.e. they can not be raised any further with out civil unrest, we are seeing this in France at the minute, but Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and even the UK are not too far behind. 
Only those in the middle pay tax, those at the bottom are too poor to pay, those at the top can afford elaborate schemes to move money off shore out of the reach of the tax man.
In order for a ever indebted and ever larger state to function it's revenue needs to go up by more than inflation, with wages and the economy going no where fast this just leaves one option.
**Confiscation of wealth**
Initially this will be targeted at those how are portrayed as being too rich, i.e. Very, very high property tax on second homes, raids on pensions/bank accounts, state gets 10% stake of your business (already floated by Labour in the UK), forced nationalisations of businesses, etc, etc.
Eventually the confiscation will become even more widespread to include most of the middle class.
IMO the end goal is for 90% of the population to have no assets and no savings. UBI will play a major part in achieving this. 
For me Bitcoin seems the ideal long term proposition to maintain or increase my wealth at this moment in time.
If anyone was five or ten minutes I have a little teaser for you.....
I write down how much your gross take income was last year.
Then minus 1) All taxes, direct and indirect 2) All interest paid on any and all loads, 3) What you think inflation is currently in your region... 
These are the three ways in which your wealth is currently confiscated.
Hypothetical example
Gross Earning £100,000:  Tax + NI = 34,000 - Interest 10,000 VAT - Other tax 12,000 - Inflation 7,000 (
Total confiscation £63,000. Money kept by you £37,000
33 out of 52 weeks you money is confiscated
19 out of 52 weeks you get to keep the money.
The system as it stands is truly sick and unfair. The sooner the Bitcoin revolution comes the better.

Some good points... However I would like to expand with the following points.
1) Does man made global warming exist?
2) Mining will gravitate to the lost price electricity, this will end up being surplus hydro energy, therefore bitcoin mining might use a ton of power but it will be sustainable 'green' energy.
3) Consumerism has peaked, bitcoin is the reason why. Why buy some useless poorly made shit today when you can buy twice as much crap in a few months time. However after a few months you still hold your BTC as the price has gone up by so much!
4) Fiat currency is (in certain areas) experiencing out of control hyper-inflation, bitcoin and stock being two. However it is only a matter of time before it affects things people buy day to day, once they realise that their savings are getting creamed they will get out of fiat in to bitcoin, property and other hard assets. This will add fuel to the out of control inflation train.

LME is the London Metals Exchange. It's where gold and silver are supposedly bought and sold. These days they just trade paper contracts and on some days 10x the annual production of gold and silver can be traded in a few minutes. i.e It would be impossible to trade this amount of real gold or silver it simply physically does not exist. 
Basically it is MtGox x 1,000,000 but is far, far too big to fail.
BTW These paper contract are used to manipulate the price of gold and silver (normally lower) to stop people rushing from fiat in to gold. A consequence of this is that people are buying Bitcoin instead. So in a strange way many of you hodlers should be thanking the somewhat scammy LME.

I've been out and bought a copy of the FT today firstly because to have Bitcoin as the main spread on the front page IS a big deal. Bitcoin has made it. Only six months ago the editor of the FT would have laughed you out of his office. 
Secondly reading between the lines, some trading (gambling?) services have shot themselves in the foot. Basically that have encouraged people to made leveraged bets on bitcoin, most people went long, they thought that the price would collapse and they would be massively quids in however it's gone the other way and now they're crapping themselves at the massive payouts they've got to make. BTW these sites never owned any bitcoin it was pure gambling and now they're screwed.
Thirdly if people have crypto exposure on sites like IG/Plus500 and this is no longer available to them all that money that they've made so far will leave these platforms and end up going in to GDAX or Coinfloor to buy REAL Bitcoin.
Interesting (financial) times ahead ;-)

I may be worth considering that when the price of Bitcoin becomes stable it is fiat currencies which are the unstables ones.
i.e 10 Satoshi's = A loaf of bread. Has been the same for months. 
Monday a loaf of bread is $3, Tues $4, Wed $5, Thursday, Friday, Sat $2, Sun $5 etc.
Then why would you want to hold fiat??? Bitcoin will be the most stable currency. i.e. what you can buy with one bitcoin today will be the same in a months time, whereas if you wanted to pay in fiat the price could be 50% more in a months time (or 50% less) depending on the demand (or lack of) for fiat at the time.

1) Shouldn't BTC users then migrate towards wallets that do implement it or is everyone happy paying $10 per Tx?
2) Without wide SegWit adoption and LN BTC is going to lose out to BCH, the 8 MB block size can really only be seen as a temporary solution, blocks could maybe go to 16 MB eventually but something like the LN will be implemented for micro transactions on  BCH, alternatively LiteCoin could be the method for day to day purchases. Long term if nothing is done high Tx fees are either going to kill BTC or turn it in to some weird elite millionaires club of hodlers like the owners of Berkshire Hathaway stock (I'm sure this is not Satoshi's or anyone else's 'vision')

It will happen because your bitcoin will be unallocated and the banks will be very happy to have a such a valuable asset on their balance sheet.
IMO though fractional reserve will not happen as if a banks says it is holding 10,000 BTC on behalf of their customers there should be someway a customer can verify this on the blockchain.
The  banks will have to show that they are trustworthy via the blockchain else other companies will come along who do and they will get the business.

Best post I've read for a very long time.
Can we please stop acting like kids and members of a personality cult. Present the hard facts, the pro's and the cons and let people make a informed choice. If they choose badly: tough shit, that's life.
Some questions I would like to see answered 1) Why has segwit not reduced Tx fees, has it been a waste of time? 2) When will LN be implemented. 
Why can't both sides BTC/BCH draw up detailed plans for their development of their coins, maybe a rolling 12 month plan detailing where they see their respective 'product' in 3/6/12 months time..... Then let the market decide.

Great to see further bitcoin acceptance.
Just been out for a bit of a drive and was having a think to myself about bitcoin and the future. Here are my conclusions.
Bitcoin will bring about the end of government as we know it as they will no longer know who owns what and therefore will see the tax revenues drop substantially.
Things like inheritance tax and means testing will no longer work.
The collapse of .gov social security schemes like benefits, food stamps, healthcare, state pension etc are going to hit many people hard for a while but as we progress in to a new age without bogus wars, MIC, corruption, cronyism, lobbying, etc, etc a much more fair world will emerge. People will be paid more but work less, but also will be expected to look after sick family members, etc. Children will receive a 'useful' education not dictated by the state which will prepare them as  productive citizens in this new world.  Some people will fall by the wayside (drug addicts,   alcoholics, dangerously stupid, etc), however many of societies most vulnerable will be better off than before as the wider family unit becomes more important.
Most power will be devolved locally, nation governments will still exist but only for the few matters that cannot be handled locally.  Above all government and central banks will have nothing to do with the supply of currency. In just a few years from now the idea will seem so stupid in hindsight.

Population distribution is like this: Middle/Upper class 10%, Dirt poor 90%.
They tell the middle/upper class that the reason taxes are so high is that the poor majority only use cash and therefore don't pay tax.
Ignore the BS about empowering the poor, its just about bringing the 90% dirt poor into the tax/banking system so that they can be kicked a little bit harder.

Buy $50 and have a play with it, send it to different wallets, learn to make a paper wallet, learn about bitcoin security and best practice.
Then if you end up losing your $50 not to worry as what you've learned will have a much greater value than $50 in the coming years!
Once you've become familiar with the whole concept and how on the whole it all works and you're comfortable with it then buy a little more.
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:31:45
If there was good bitcoin liquidity on the exchange then the spread would not be so high.
For someone to buy... someone must sell, but once you sell you can't easily get your fiat back..... So you don't sell but instead move your bitcoins to another exchange.... which further reduces bitcoin liquidity and causes the spread to increase.
Ergo.... sooner or later if this is not sorted out bitcoin withdrawals will have to be halted or the exchange will collapse.

The bitcoin etf failed for one simple reason. Bitcoin is unregulated. 
Why did it take so long for the SEC to reject it?
The Winklevoss twins took tried to argue that because their exchange was legit and regulated that this was enough. The SEC (quite rightly IMO) disagreed.
If anyone on here follows the price of Silver then you'll know how the price can be influenced by imaginary Wall St devices. Futures, rehypothiction, outright fraud. IMO a few years down the line the would be MtGox all over again.
Now I know that Wall St is where the big money is at, and a 100 billion injection into bitcoin would make some of you very happy,  but Wall St. has a long track record of hyping something new, making a ton of money from it, getting joe public to buy it at the top of the market, before trashing it.
Eventually Wall St and the big banks will 'take over' Bitcoin, just like a handful of companies now pretty much control the internet. But for the time being we are living in glorious unregulated times (just like the internet was pre Y2K), enjoy it people because it won't last forever!

If you take a real close look at society. You'll see that what I've detailed above is in the very, very early stages. This wont happen overnight and will be gradual but the change is starting. Brexit and Trump are will be seen in hindsight as the beginning of the end for big government, gradually you'll see the end of high taxes, MIC, vast regulation, etc. People will be left to get on with their own lives the best way they seem fit. The loss of the power to print money will be the final nail in the coffin for them and they'll use every trick in the book to keep the fiat ponzi scheme alive.

In my dealings with the 'Homer Simpson's' AKA turning 60-ish Baby boomers, is that they have no concept or personal responsibility. Got a problem, it's the .gov's problem to sort out for you. Cocked up a big bank transfer, no problem, just phone up the bank get them to sort it out.
This is the reason why they're massively in debt, with no pensions or savings as when it all goes wrong they think they'll get bailed out by the .gov.

In the 1950's Elvis Presley and Eddie Cochran where death metal.
In the 60's it was the Doors and Hendrix
In the 70's it was the Black Sabbath and later Sex Pistols and Punk
In the 80's it was the Beastie Boys, Slayer &amp; Judas Priest.
In the 90's it was Metallica and Guns N' Roses.
In the 2000's it was Marilyn Manson and Slipnot.

With interest rates already historically very low, the FED, ECB, BoJ, BoE will not be able to lower then enough to jolt the economy back to life. This leaves two options. 1) Negative interest rates... Possible but will just mean people flow in to gold and bitcoin. 2) Try to reduce the debt burden on the economy by CTRL+P their way out of this, i.e you owe the bank a million and can't pay... if they inflate the currency away so that a ok second hand car is now costs a million then your debt doesn't look so bad anymore.

As the EU showed no desire to reform the savvy and astute people of the UK basically said 'fuck the EU' not through violence but legitimately through the ballot box.

It will play out as follows.
Central Banks will print fiat. It will be too obvious for them to buy US$ 5 Billion on coinbase so will get in to mining.
They will start accumilting crypto on the quiet. Then if the fiat system collapses (not really if but when) then $, £ etc will be worth a load less. However as the central bank has  managed to accumilate large amounts of crypto they still maintain their power base as a mover and shaker. The CB's will never give up their power no matter what and if they see crypto's gaining a foothold (have they not already???) you can be assured they will be aquiring them on the quiet for power preservation reasons.

Now it you mention bitcoin please either ask you how many times a day you check the price or where can you get some.
Bitcoin ATM is not perfect but neither was the PC experience in 1990 or the internet experience in 1996. The fact that it's out their working (in a fashion) independantly and correctly and that average people are taking a interest in it is what counts. 
For anyone that has the time, relax, close your eyes and then begin to contemplate what would be the ramifications if your government/banking system did not have control over your local currency and you just might begin to see how big this is going to be.

All news is propaganda to a certain extent, every time a story is published the whole reason for publishing that story is to change your opinion, even if just slightly, other wise they would just publish a table of (hopefully) facts and let you make your own mind up.

Once had a few too many drinks and started trading some LTC to BTC on a exchange. It's all a little blurry now but I thought that I had incorrectly entered the price and basically gave all the LTC away! It was not a small amount either (house money) anyway I began to feel real sick, thinking what the fuck have I just done, then started to justify it... I can make it back, it'll be ok, etc. Anyway after a minute I unblurred my vision, rechecked my account and it turns out I did pretty well out of the trade and had not made a mistake after all. I spent the next 10 minutes curled up on the floor hyper-ventilating like a asthmatic!
Learned my lesson there. When dealing with life changing amounts of money do it sober!

My take on the current crash is....
This last week has or two has seen the beginning of serious amounts of professional/smart money come into cryptos. Because these markets can be very volatile and are open 24/7 a smart speculator would close out all his positions before leaving for the weekend (also a bank holiday in the uk) so were seeing a sell off. Come Mon/Tues all that money (and more) will flood back in. Rinse and repeat....

I very much agree with this advice, buying bitcoin is a risk, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, etc, etc, all great advice.
However for the last 4 years I've been investing in the most reckless fashion possible, taking out loans to buy bitcoin, delaying paying bills (even tax) to buy bitcoin, working all the hours god sends to buy bitcoin, as well as many other things which may be considered grey areas (nothing criminal or immoral). All for the pursuit or more bitcoin, to be honest its been a wild four years, lots of ups, some downs, mad celebrations turning quickly in despair, etc, etc, Anyway back to the point.... Investing recklessly worked out great for me.

OK... here's what happened.... I got in to bitcoin at £180..... after that I was hooked.... I carried out my reckless plan till it hit £3000, then I held off for a bit and basically became close to a real mess as it kept going up. Then I quit my job (by all measures a very good job), I handed my notice in at the end of December 2018, and left at the end of Jan 2019... (Ouch....).. Then I did nothing for a few months and lived off a bit of bitcoin cash I got from the fork. A few months later I ended up getting another job, the price was around £6000, I started buying small amounts again, as the price dropped I started buying more and more and becoming reckless again!!! (The absolute best) I am still buying now and guess I will keep buying until I quit my new job (which I don't think will be too long ;-) but who knows???)


Anyone who knows me, knows I only speak the truth, whilst not wanting to disclose too much I hope some of the facts presented above may sway your opinion of me!

Point taken.... But surly coinbase should have let regular customers know that the rules were changing. 
How would you feel if you deposited money it to your bank account and was free to spend it one day and the next day you found you couldn't as 'new rules' meant that it was locked for 5 days. Surely they should have sent something out communicating the new rules before you made the decision to deposit the funds??? Very poor.

The idea of UBI has never appealed to me. Especially as you look around and see thousands of jobs that need to be done but are never done, maintenance of parks and gardens, bridges to paint, etc, etc. The likes of Zuccerberg claim than UBI would allow people to become creative geniuses and vastly benefit mankind as a result, but all I see happening is that even more people will become feeble minded, substance addled, unhealthy, spiritually numb, state dependent slobs just joining the long queue to eventually be turned in to dog meat.

Remember the days when it felt like AOL would send you 5 CD-ROM's every day in the post.
The late nineties were a great time on the net, before it all became commercialized. You would spend your time stumbling from one crazy website to the next, bookmarking the best ones you found. Now to most people the internet is four or five sites, facebook, google, amazon, ebay, etc.
Yes, bitcoin does feel very much like the early days when the internet was starting to become big. TBH it's got me interested in technology again, as the 2000's progressed the internet became really boring esp after the whole napster thing. I think that scared a lot of people from doing creative stuff for fear of breaking some obscure law and being sued. 
Just on with a project to bring a old pc very much back from the dead to run a full node on, installed Lubuntu, got about 300gb of HDD spare but only 360ish Mb of RAM! Tried to sync the blockchain but the lack of ram holding me back, have just ordered 4GB of DDR2 off ebay, should be running by the weekend.
This is so much fun! Just like the old days except back then we were swapping SNES ROMs over ICQ or uploading them to clandestine websites!

No I have never sold any of my Bitcoin... If I had sold some at close to the high what would have happened if it has gone to the moon... I would have been gutted. 
However the main question is this..... what would I have done with the money? Pay off debt.... I can get as much credit as I want at sub 2% (i.e not worth using bitcoin to pay off) , bought a flash car/house, the sums involved would have been very hard to hide (tax wise)  so I just though fuck it I'll HODL. 
**Remember you don't own possessions... they end up owning you.**
Deep down material things don't make you happy, the might for a short time but will ultimately leave you feeling empty. Its a bit like saying I'm the happiest guy in the world whilst been off your head on coke every waking hour.
I didn't need the money... I live quite frugally and have everything I need in abundance. So I HODL.

That happened to me on coinbase too. If ever the buy looks to have stalled halfway though I always wait for a few hours to make sure I don't double buy.

I used to to use coinbase/GDAX but with the new five day rule it has to be [coinfloor.co.uk]( only thing is.... is that minimum deposit is £1000. Which might be a lot for some people.

Iraq wanted to use Euro's for part of their oil sales. Whereas Libya wanted to use a gold backed Dinar.

...but every time the price goes higher some hodlers will sell to pay off fiat debt, mortgage, car, student loan, etc.
Every hodler has a price.

Fractional reserve banking is such as scam that people will actively shun finding out the facts as the truth is more than most of them can handle.

I have a bit of a habit of making (often correct) predictions based on nothing more that gut feeling.
Prediction 1) The bitcoin price on 1st Jan 2018 will be around or greater than twice the price of bitcoin tomorrow.
Prediction 2) The economy will next crash when the price of gold drops below $1150/oz. Interest rates over the world will rise, only so they have room to lower then again. The crash will happen sometime in the next six months. 
Prediction 3) If prediction 2 is correct and the crash is epic expect the price predicted in prediction 1 to be a gross under-estimation.

It has already happened in Libya.

I would like to go on record to predict that UBI will not help anyone find a path out of poverty and will in fact do the opposite.

For the millionth time.... bitcoin is not a stock and coinmarketcap is not the stock exchange.
They are very much different. A new form of money with a limited supply is not the same as the current darling of the stock exchange.
When old people realise that their means tested benefits will not be affected if they have bitcoin, they will buy bitcoin. When guy who lost his savings through a bail-in realises that this can't happen with bitcoin, they will buy bitcoin. When the pensioner whose savings were destroyed through run away inflation realises that bitcoin protects him, he will buy bitcoin.
The use cases are many and tbh bitcoin has barely started to get going.

If you think about it Trump is the perfect guy for a crash.
1) Bankruptcy expert - Check
2) Populist - Check
3) Liked by the poor - Check
4)  Master of distraction - Check
5) Expert deal maker -  Check
He's the best candidate for the job of flushing this debt upon debt upon debt charade down the toilet.

Grandad still should have a punt with say 1% of his savings though.

Expect more of this.
Central banks cant print to buy bitcoin... The fiat con would collapse uncontrollably.
1. Steal
2. Print fiat and 'invest' in mining operations.
Expect more of both.
IMHO Coinbase will be ok (friends in high places???) expect the smaller exchanges to be eaten alive by actions like this.

Not too bad a story for the  MSM
How can you be for anarchy but want a central .gov to pay your way? Can someone please explain this... seems contradictory to me.

Encouraging people to be 100% dependant on the government instead of taking responsibility for themselves is not helping them.

Once your core software has synced I would be great if you had some bitcoin.
Please keep us updated and good luck!

Gold has its place, as does silver. Bitcoin also has its place which whilst being a similar place to gold it is not the same place as gold. Why? Well bitcoin and gold are very different. Gold has value due to its history, bitcoin has value due to its future.

Second this.. Initially send a small amount of bitcoin to your wallet then try to recreate your wallet from seed, then try to imagine a host of disasters, food, fire, theft, etc. could you still recreate your wallet. Only when you can answer yes to all of the above should you move significant funds.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:50:24
100% agree. Great post.

2017... The year bitcoin goes mainstream?
Oh and if HL are raking it in through fees you can bet every broker in the UK will be offering this by autumn.
I predict that we'll see $5000 bitcoin in 2017.

Big banks will simply lobby for a change in the law. They do not have the skills to destroy from within.

I don't think KDC is the grand bitcoin wizard you proclaim him to be.
His vast amounts of hot air does not set the prices on exchanges.
