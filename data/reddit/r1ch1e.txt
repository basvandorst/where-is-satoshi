When it's proposed and/or supported by the 'central' Bitcoin community and isn't developed by inept hackers in a rushed attempt to wrestle control and assume sole ownership of Bitcoin itself.
I'm in favour of 2MB, I think it's needed as a stop gap until the various L2 scaling technologies are fully developed and tested (something we want to avoid rushing).

In case it is a case of just not quite 'getting it'....
Shelf price $1000, your company receives $1000 to their account
Payment of 1BTC @ 1000USD/1BTC rate
6 months later, item returned
Refund of shelf price, your company refunds $1000 from their account
Payment to customer of 0.5BTC @ 2000USD/1BTC rate
Payment to customer of 2BTC @ 500USD/1BTC rate.
Customer still has $1000 refunded to them, you received $1000 and then 6 months later refunded $1000 they just made their payment and received their refund in Bitcoin.
It's really that simple. If you have a customer suggest that they should receive 1BTC back after 6 months, simply point out that would be like refunding them $2000 (or $500). The shelf price was $1000 they got back $1000 'worth'.

Did you download a program on your computer? Are you using the same computer you were using back then, or do you still have it? Check for a "Bitcoin Core" program. Any other files saved to the computer around that time with any info in them? 
Did you use a website to buy it? Does your web browser history go back far enough to help you out? Look back through your emails around that time for accounts you might have signed up to, and try some searches for "bitcoin", "gox", "btc" "btc-e" (others may be able to suggest some more).
You're gonna need something more to go on, at the moment it's like saying "I had a $20 note once, but I don't know where I put it".
