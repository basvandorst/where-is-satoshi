This sounds like blaming newcomers which know 0 about bitcoin and are fuelling the current price. You should be thankful for some of the money cause there are lots of people who sold at 17k-20k.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:36:56
Has been shown that segwit doesn't ease the pain (fees). Bigger blocksize (which doesn't have support) is the solution

60-70% of BTC hashrate comes from China... I don't think you should mention "china shitcoin" cause you have just shitted on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:37:55
Look at all ats, they doubled in last week. People are just finding someone to blame that BTC so not 100 000 already.

I think I would have to do my own counting. Script would be transparent. I don't have time for that now.

You blame him that you don't earn? That is the true greed.

This can have a devastating effect. Once banks stop moving money from/into exchange bank addresses all crypto coin prices will plummet...
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:32:22
If the bitcoin price went to the moon they would love coinbase. Don't trust anyone here. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:17:51
You should also point that is good to read other subs and have unbiased opinion. You won't read on this sub about companies have who stopped accepting bitcoin due to fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:34:45
Where are your network fees? Please fix and use other crypto currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:08:58
That will happen with Tether, not BCH dump.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:58:24
It is like divorce, one day BTC and BCH will hopefully find peace. Only those who sold BCH early can complain about their stupidity. Same stupidity applies to those who switched from BTC to BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:25:02
I don't understand people here. It was your wish for Coinbase to add BCH. Now you call it attack!
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:03:51
Currently neither BTC nor BCH can be used as a payment for coffee twice a day by each person in the world. They both try to get usable by different approach. Currently Bitcoin is an asset (gold) with slightly higher fees than BCH.

It is good to read this sub and btc sub cause in each I learn what the other sub is silent about. But I am surprised that with $3000 you call it trap. If it is going to be $100 000 coin still a trap?
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:10:03
Someone doesn't understand forking. Developer my explanation: fork is an exact copy of original process. In this case it means = copy of brand ownership rights. This should be explained to noobs: "every new bitcoin fork has full rights to use bitcoin in its name"
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:09:25
If no one is able to buy bitcoin with real cash than whole crypto is doomed. Doesn't matter if it is digital gold or usable for payment. Where do you think your employer will get those bitcoins to pay you for your work? (he must exchange it for cash) 
PS: Actual gold has industry/fashion usage. Digital gold - sry, just a bubble. If you can pay for items - this is a real usage.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:29:54
Not ALL: "Bitcoin Investment Trust has decided to sell some of its holdings and distribute the cash to its shareholders.". Those who are smart read carefully. I don't trust this sub or btc sub.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:35:10
I think all cryptos should have a set price cause people are here to get rich and lambos, not to have a better world without banks.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:32:49
How do you think regular people buy bitcoin? If it is forbidden by law for bank to transfer money from/to well known accounts  we are all doomed and whole crypto bubble pops. There is no way one can use bitcoin for purchases (fees) or be paid in bitcoins (employer has to buy them on exchange)
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:40:32
Are you complaining because you lost money? I don't get you people. You have all you wanted so you can dump. I think you only want to get rich. If not you blame all others.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:01:28
You expect people to mine their own bitcoin? Of course they need to buy it first with cash.

BTC will be back to 20 000 next year before march. Question is summit G20 which can impose taxes and blockages.

@_date: 2017-12-29 21:19:07
You keep your coins on coinbase? LOL
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:44:34
You shouldn't focus on LN release day but on G20 meeting date. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:42:13
People should be feared of G20 summit in March not Coinbase or BCH. G20 summit can make their coins unusable.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:33:20

I received the same but as an email in summer 2016. 
It is in Slovakian language. Basically they asked what I did, why and if I plan to do it again and also reported me to police according to local laws.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:31:58
Those who are smart read both subs (bitcoin and btc). I don't trust any of them but it is a source of links. Those who read btc are informed that is getting adopted with speed of light and all those people who stopped supporting bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:45:09
Cause bitcoin cash is promoted on media like CNBC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:23:15
Pure speculation
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:57
Just a correction which is good. You shouldn't be thinking get rich fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:35:17
First of all you should thank them. Without them it wouldn't be so easy to buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:27:09
Have lightning code doesn't mean all bitcoin nodes will adopt it... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:27:57
How sure are you that there won't be another fork? Some nodes might decide not to support it. This is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:39:48
How do I verify this claim?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:12:09
How do you know that those people will dump? Is it because you believe in it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:28:06
I think this is why we should not continue in the discussion cause you don't listen and don't give arguments or answers. Any money is a bubble that is controlled by central bank. Bitcoin is currently NOT even wannabe money. You call it digital gold.  And the first moment any crypto money will threat monetary system or current taxation there will be a big ban on crypto. Now, it is still something small. We are like in the same time when internet was born (1980s).
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:32
Basically you suggest hard fork to increase block size. Not sure if there is agreement...
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:53:15
I don't understand people (fanatics) here. There is a shared history. How do you explain newcomers that just 3 months ago it was one unified coin? How are you going to explain the fact that 3 years ago bitcoin was meant to be main crypto for payments (not an asset) and now bitcoin rebranded to asset (meant to be stored like gold). I have BTC as well as BCH but I can't stand people here and there are both full of lies just to take newcomers money.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:21:05
This is such a political statement (really). Block size is immediate remedy. I am just surprised it did not happen already. Who is profiting from current block size. I am for block size increase but I am it won't happen cause some people won't make money...
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:24:23
Political statement. There is a proof that historically Bitcoin was for blocksize increase before segwit. Someone is making profit now - so blocksize increase won't happen. Even LN needs another hard fork...
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:26:56
STOP!  It was your wish for Coinbase to add BCH so one can dump. Now you call it attack! I don't understand people here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:35:26
i agree that the poster described it correctly. But the comments here and there are blaming Coinbase suddenly that it was a wrong move. All I see is people wanting to get rich quick complaining. They want newbies money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:08
If there is agreement for hard fork what is blocking it? I don't think there is agreement... I am surprised by some people that originally wanted to increase block size, at the time of BCH fork were strongly against and suddenly are for block size increase. Fees are a threat for the whole existence of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:38:22
Today I read about 3 important economist warning about bitcoin + this article. Why do you blame BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:11:19
From MAN page:
"fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process, referred to as the child, is an exact duplicate of the calling process, referred to as the parent, except for the following points:"

Cryptocurrency = alts + bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:33:31
You want to get rich or use bitcoin. If get rich - PANIC, if use trust bitcoin and don't be feared of correction. BTC will rise again. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:38:58
So you basically ignore other toll roads. The toll of bitcoin is the highest but it doesn't mean there are no other toll roads...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:51:46
Some people told me that lightning doesn't require hard fork. I am surprised that bitcoin has to go through so many hard forks. This is what BCH was criticised for.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:08:09
I just recommend to read other subs and have unbiased opinion. Use brain and never trust others with your money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:34:00
If CNBC can make bitcoin to fall than it is not that great as one things. If anyone thinks that CNBC makes bitcoin popular than they have problem getting rich fast.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:11:55
I thought it is related to Australia where banks announced they freeze accounts that send/receive money to bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:33:07
It will drop but it doesn't take much time to be back to 1000. If we want bitcoin to be usable we need to fork to 16-32 MB blocks. Lightning needs time (1-2years). Miners doesn't want fork. Honestly I am watching bitcoin slowly dying.This can be reversed by bigger blocks instantly.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:32:52
Price of bitcoin moves up whenever new tethers are printed out of blue. When it is going down tethers are printed just few hours after it went down. Coincidence?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:19:56
It is really hard these days to use search for finding information. Mostly you find unverified claims or financially motivated claim. No one has time to verify what is true or what is missing or information intentionally omitted. Majority of people wants to onboard new users so their *favorite* currency goes up and they profit. So they say lies just to onboard. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:01:44
The number of unconfirmed transactions dropped by 50 000 from 170 000 but the total fees increased by $4 millions -&gt; From $9 to $13. Why the fees are increasing? Can someone explain. Thanks

When I see movement of BTC like 25 000BTC. It happened this weekend and it shaked the market.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:12:40
I don't understand the logic. Does someone needs to move bitcoins quickly because of some crash or other attack?
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:43:45
Nice coincidence. Those 30 mil tethers moved to bitfinex just at the same time bitcoin went up.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:18:53
I agree. I just replied that the analysis wasn't complete. It is just one man view saying it's FUD from his point of view but he omits some facts that for some it is not FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:52:42
Cause regulators regulate. Market cap $128,000,000 x 9 = $1,152,000,000 thats a nice way to introduce Bitcoin Bank tax. Anyone who tries to cash out in a public bank gonna pay taxes. This will push the price down.

To see how much you need to pay for instant confirmation is listed here.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:08:29
Aren't we solving question, fee vs confirmation time? Consider that you are a trader and you need to get those money to/out of exchange. You simply said that if you have enough time you are ok to send with low fee. You did not answer question how much do I need to pay for next block confirmation (confirmation in 30 min).
