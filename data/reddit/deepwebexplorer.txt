I love this perspective. The comparison to the early internet is spot on in terms of expectations vs reality. I loved the internet, but it was so damn frustrating. It still is from time to time, but those early days were painful. I had to make plans to go on the Internet!

But then again, I’m totally cool with my debt being inflated away.

Wonder if there is a way to automate this???? Seems like a really cool idea for a service. Maintain your BTC balance while encouraging use and acceptance.

To be clear, I’m not about to read this article...but women do drive way more purchasing decisions than men. So if it was true that women are becoming more interested in Bitcoin or crypto, it’s actually a very big deal.

I’m buying. It’s a million more times exciting than my 401k.  I can’t imagine that the upcoming trade war is going to be good for the stock market anyway. Might as well take some risk on percentage of what I was gambling on wall street.

Is there a website/app that keeps track of vendors who accept Bitcoin? I’d love to start spending some locally in the city where I work but as far as I know, I’d just have to look for a “We accept Bitcoin” sticker in the window. Seems like a Bitcoin vendor app would be really beneficial for adoption.

Did you ever look at the back of a $20 bill...on weed?

Because they might just be 15 years old. Remember, on the internet no one knows you are a dog.
