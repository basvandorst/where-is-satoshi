Yes. Really. Their reasoning was that to understand the technology , the Blockchain. They thought a good way to do that was to set up their own wallet to buy and sell bitcoins. But bitcoins are not that big in Norway so it isn't really a big competition... and we don't have such aggressive banks as you do in the us so.... no biggie. Is it that strange?
edit: i will even one up you...
[this seems to be the bank employees bitcoin wallet.]( probably not the banks bitcoin wallet... but still, no worry. People can play around with it.

I know these people are supposed to be big but... except being in conflict with Facebook, what have they done and why should i care about what they will do soon?

I was at a programming conference here in Norway where one of the biggest banks of Norway was having a stand with a competition. Their competition was to sign up for a bitcoin wallet (any wallet, not theirs), and then they gave me 0.0002 btc. Not much of a competition, or amount of bitcoins, but the bank gave me bitcoins. But again, Norway is kind of different than most countries....
