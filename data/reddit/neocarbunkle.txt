I don't feel bad for people who didn't buy in already. Bitcoin was all over the news in 2014 and then got super cheap for a while. Plenty of chances.

I laughed so hard.

How are they able to sell my coins? They got 1/4 of the coins back, they should return 1/4. I don't understand this logic.

I agree. Until you can go to a supermarket and grab some sort of prepaid card or something, most people won't use bitcoin.

I feel like more and more companies are doing what bitcoin does, but does it with out the fear that your money might lose its value.
Of course bitcoin not being controlled by any government or group is great, but I think something like this might be more practical to use for most people.

Something similar happened to me two years ago. Lost a lot of money and couldn't do anything about it.

I knew a guy 15 years ago who had three and went to segway conventions. He was also kind of a weird guy...

So many old people still write checks for everything. Why would they adopt to bitcoin?

I just set up a weekly buy on coinbase a few years ago and left it alone. Too bad I didn't have the extra cash to budget more back then.
