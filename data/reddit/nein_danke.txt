I am a fan of both Bitcoin and Dogecoin.  I own and use both.  You are far too young to be a curmudgeonly old man, kamlem1; I am thirty-five and I love cryptocurrency, including Dogecoin.
What is good for Doge is good for Bit, and vice-versa.  Doge is Bit's best friend.  Peace.

I love a good fanfic.

Who the fuck said she didn't expect it?  *We all expect it.*

Now my curiosity is piqued.  *A Song of Ice and Fire* gets bumped down the queue, again.

Are you a troll or an idiot?
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:35:17
To be fair, that's actually pretty good.  The first bitcoin pizza cost what, 10k BTC?

Your fedora is quite something.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:10:23
You sound like a fool.

This happened to me on New Years Eve, also probably because I put an unsecured copy in Dropbox.  I was an idiot, and I'm grateful that I only lost six dollars worth of bitcoin.
These days, all of my cryptos are in cold storage.  There is simply no other way unless you intend to spend right that moment.  I keep a laptop that I can painlessly wipe if I ever need to unlock my wallets.
I'm sorry for your loss.  I know it stings, but try to consider it a lesson that you've paid for.

Lol.  Seriously? That has got to be the smallest dick I have ever seen.  Get the fuck outta here.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:36:25
I can't argue with that.

For me, it's actually very difficult to be happy-go-lucky.  I've suffered from anxiety and severe depression for half of my life.  All of the things you've written here are things I could have written, things I *have* written, in the past about other things, activities, people... I was a very unhappy person.  Sometimes I still am.
But we are not soulless or brain dead.  To the contrary, most of us give the best of ourselves to that community.  I know that I do.  And Doge gives back; in the morning, I want to get out of bed and see what's going on.  For once in my life, *I want to get out of bed.*  I simply cannot overstate how good that is.
I hope your mood lightens soon.  We are not who you think we are, and if you ever change your mind, we'll be happy to see you in our community.  Until then, keep this.  You never know what might happen.
+100 doge
Edited for grammar mistake.

I think that would be received very well.  We'd love to get to know you guys better.  Even if you decide against tipping BTC, please come by and introduce yourself to everyone.
+100 doge
(I hope my tip does not offend, I mean it as a compliment.)

I told my SO about it, because I intend to win.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:18:38
Thank you, you're very kind.

Thank you.  Please don't decide to end the contest early, I'm still working on my submission.

I love this one so much.
