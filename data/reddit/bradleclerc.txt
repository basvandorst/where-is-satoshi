I usually use CAvirtex, including having their debit card for withdrawls into CAD when needed. Been pretty smooth.

Nah, just moved more such things to other parts of the world until they have a freak out and make it easier in the US again. Same old story with a lot of things.
Temporary annoyance for some, for sure, but not the end of the world by FAR.

Other than it not at all being the first, it's still pretty neat... assuming they can find a provider to work with them.

Love the idea, but seems to take forever to load, or just hang, about half the time. Sometimes just loads the balance, sometimes just the qr code, sometimes neither, sometimes both load nice and quick. Very inconsistent.
Still the best app of it's kind mind you, but I'd love it to load consistently...

Started with about $5 USD worth of coins in late 2011. Recently sold them off for a good chunk more than that and back to holding about $5 USD worth.  If it starts climbing like mad again, I may get to cash out for another batch of profit... if not, meh.
Cheapest roller-coaster ride ever.

I hope it doesn't happen, but hell, that's not going to stop me from dropping a comment!

Well hot damn that is a high quality shitpost. Almost too high quality really. Shitposts are this caliber are truly a paradox.

Seriously. 99.999% chance no transfer took place at this point... so... meh.

The other 8% are so off the grid they couldn't be found for comment.

What if we don't care how, and are just morbidly curious where this is going?

Didn't know tipping Tuesday was a thing until under 30 seconds ago. I'll have to remember to pass along the good vibes!

Seems like the site has been down since pretty much just after people noticed this donation? About a day now? :/

Been pushing for this for a while. Nice to see it finally escape beta and enter the wild! Fun times ahead!
