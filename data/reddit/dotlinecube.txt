It is artificial, and these claims are not backed by research. 
If you have any real research please link it.
Miner incentive to include as many transactions as possible has to be fixed, yes.
That's what IBLT, SG and the existing Bitcoin Relay Network are for.
Your other points are merely assumptions.
For example, while costs to run a node would indeed rise with bigger blocks, there is a good chance that with increased utility of the network any business relying on correct blockchain data will run at least one node themselves.
And there is no evidence that mining has become any more centralized over the last year, except for most of it happening in China, which is a consequence of cheap electricity and faster access to mining hardware rather than anything else.

Where are the questions?
The breadwallet conversion rate is likely wrong, you could help by writing [bug reports ]( for this issue and the crashing.
And what's your comparison criteria for your "last thing"?
In terms of functionality it's more like:
Mobile is to desktop what:
breadwallet is to Multibit (since both are SPV wallets without blockchain) and
mycelium is to electrum (since both are light wallets where a server holds the blockchain).
Armory can't be compared since it is a full blockchain desktop client without a mobile equivalent.

I believe "FSS RBF" means you can only doublespend the same amount to the same outputs, but with a higher fee.
Following from the requirement that the outputs won't change:
If you try to double spend the same input, but with less coins from that input, the output(s) would have to change as well to since the change has to go somewhere.
What you mean would be RBF which would allow for completely replacing any transaction with any other from that input, as long as the fee is higher.

For a "study" there's an astounding lack of documentation in that link.
But anyway, it says "a single machine" can **today** (Oct. 2014) handle 32mb blocks at best. 
The current proposal is 8, and Gavin said he tested 20 without problems.
Assuming Moore's law holds, a single machine should be able to handle 8GB blocks in 2036 without problems.
Then again it is also complete conjecture since nobody can pretend to know what happens in the next 20 years.
At least we now have a plan which is more progressive than "let's do nothing and see".

By that logic a large chunk of gold is worth more when it's on top of Mount Everest or the bottom of the sea, because it's much more expensive to move.
One characteristic of good money is transportability, and if transacting is expensive then the utility is diminished.

The whole giant discussion about raising the blocksize/transaction capacity over the last year, which got very emotional between several camps.
Now Mike Hearn declared it dead and failed, and his word apparently still carried some weight. 
Bitcoin actually did move inversely to stocks during the last days/weeks, this current drop seems (to me) more tied to the internal fights and some uncertainty where to go from here.

You are missing the part where several BIPs were proposed and all rejected by Core. And where Core made it clear that there will be no increase in Blocksize despite public demand, rendering all BIP proposals for an increase pointless.

"a few".
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:41:29
Blockstream depends on *their own* version of Bitcoin.
Demand for their product "Lightning Network" only exists if people can't transact fast and cheap enough on the main chain.
Therefore they have a clear incentive to shape Bitcoin in a way that people would be forced away from using the main chain.
Don't pretend they are independend and doing things just out of the goodness of their hearts. They also have to answer to the people who gave them $21M in funding.

Well, actually there is some evidence that some developers are trying to push their own agenda. 
I have a lot respect for all their work, but some statements and actions have led me to assume bad faith, yes.
But we don't need to argue. Let's just wait and see what happens once Bitcoin Classic goes live.

Alright, it's closer to anarchy. 
Still, everyone has a voice, and as we can see now there seems to be a majority of people agreeing on something despite the resistance of the "ruling elite".
That's quite close to "rule of the people" and pretty democratic.

Why is there even a need to "wrestle control" from them? Ideally they should be open to compromises, yet they rejected every single one.
Their motivation doesn't even matter, if they refuse all compromises and cooperation, then control has to be handed over to someone more willing to cooperate.
What you are seeing with classic is not infiltration, it's democracy slowly finding a consensus.

It simply makes no sense. Either they trust each other, in which case they should simply use one of the many distributed databases, all of which are vastly more efficient than Bitcoin.
Or they want an immutable ledger, which means "trustless", which means they need a system to secure their blockchain against tampering. 
For this, they need someone to mine, as well as an incentive to do so, which means they'll need a valuable token.
If they think they don't need mining, we're right back at "why not just use a distributed DB".
Please explain to me how "tokenless blockchain" is supposed to work, and is any different from an existing distributed db.

Of course I'll hold my coins as long as possible and only spend when necessary.
Since a currency with a fixed supply is theoretically better at retaining value than the ever-inflating fiat currencies, I will of course spend all the depreciating fiat I have before using the better money.
It's more a matter of "not getting poorer" than "getting rich".
Besides, getting rich off Bitcoin would currently take quite a long time, and there's still the risks that it might become obsolete or even fail completely.
I won't sell/spend at any specific price, I'll only do it when I have no fiat left.
(Altough I did spend some on a computer game as a gift for a friend, because I have no credit card AND it was a better deal than anywhere else. I immediately rebought the coins.)
Finally, it's simply a hedge against a global economy and monetary system that I consider to be broken and slowly failing.
How can I save some money for my retirement when I believe there are no safe assets left anywhere in the world?
Stocks are overvalued and in my opinion in a bubble, property is overvalued, precious metals are just as much valued on belief as Bitcoin, and interest on a savings account isn't even enough to keep up with inflation.
Bitcoin is just as unsafe, but at least there's still a possible upside.
So I'll continue to put 10% of my monthly income in my "Bitcoin Savings Account", and hope that it will at least keep its value.

Where do you get this "quadratic increase" from?
I can't find any sources saying that verification time scales like that. 
The load on a single node scales linearly as far as I know, that talk about O(n squared) is usually thrown around regarding the load on the the whole network.

You can't "move" your savings, they are on your private key no matter what.
In the event of a fork you would have the same coins on both sides of the fork, and could simply wait it out until one chain wins.
The dangerous part would be accepting coins during an undecided fork, since transactions from the losing branch could either be invalidated as a double spend when the network converges again, or become worthless if one side wins without reconciled chains.

@_date: 2015-09-26 19:37:52
It doesn't mean much to you. When a fork happens, your coins will be on both sides of the fork, with the same private key. 
The biggest danger lies in sending/receiving coins during the time the fork is not yet resolved since you might send/receive them from the side of the branch that is later declared invalid by the longer chain.
So as a casual user, just sit it out and wait until the fork is resolved, update your wallet, and continue as usual.

I do the same, saving a small amount every month.
I believe it is slightly crazy, seeing that it might still fail.
Then again, I already trust it more to retain value over the next 20 years than any other investment/savings fund.

Because for me it's like a longterm savings account.
I don't try to time the markets, I just slowly keep saving more. Because I believe it will still be worth at least what I paid for it in 10 to 20 years. Maybe not, but trying to trade just means a higher chance to end up with less coins.

@_date: 2015-03-20 19:32:15
I would be happy to see them succeed, but I have specific issues with Ethereum.  
First one is the marketing, they have been telling everyone how great it will be even though there is no guarantee it will work.
And their crowdsale was slightly dishonest in stating that this is NOT AN INVESTMENT, when most people clearly hope for a higher price. But I suppose asking for donations would not have yielded as much. At least they were honest in also stating the possibility of total failure.
It simply looked like a bit of a cashgrab, promising way too many features and hyping a nonexisting product.
I too am excited about things like smart contracts, but remember the one universal truth in crypto:
Until there is a working product in the hands of users, it must be considered vaporware.
And about the "focus", while experimentation is useful and required, I believe right now it would be more beneficial to join together to build on the already existing technology, fix its flaws and make it bulletproof. Instead of already trying to invent the next big thing, when most people don't even know about/care about/can use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-28 14:18:01
Sorry, but it simply does not make sense. 
If it is directly tied 1:1 to Bitcoin, you'll get the worst of both worlds: the volatility of Bitcoin transferred to physical banknotes, and the possibility of counterfeits transferred to Bitcoin.
If you insist on establishing a local currency, a dual approach might work better: 
Promote both the local currency to support the local community, as well as Bitcoin, the "local currency of the internet".
Get as many merchants and people on board as possible,
gain the benefits of the local currency while also raising awareness for Bitcoin.
Backing it 1:1 by Bitcoin would couple the local currency to the global trade of Bitcoin, which could work in the long run, but is not a particularly good idea right now.
@_date: 2015-10-26 12:41:24
Yes, it would work if Bitcoin was the only existing currency.
However, right now most of their expenses are probably in USD, and the volatility is still pretty wild, which would make running a business solely on BTC very entertaining.
And even if they hold only BTC, how will they spend USD?
All Bitcoin payment processors and exchanges will deny them service just like the banks, for the same reason.
While it is obviously a very good payment system for this industry, it will only be used once weed is completely legal.
