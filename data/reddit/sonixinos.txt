There doesnt seem to be any fees but they are charging you more than the market rate for BTC $11343.14 when GDAX has it at $11168.40

works for me. There doesn't seem to be a fee associated with it either.  Is that right?

You're not kidding I love this the interface is so much better! I just signed up I like that it lets you track your investment in USD and tracks your return.  Awesome website.

When you go to purchase it tells you how much you're buying at what rate.  You dont have to complete the transfer to have it show you the rate though.

Not the original post.  Im guessing OP put his wallet on there hoping for handouts.

This is what happens when people just tell everyone to HODL.  Challengly took it to heart :)

Minimum $5 USD too

But at this point (assuming BTC is our new global currency :) ) there are going to be millions of transactions every second so at a certain point the number of nodes would have an affect on transaction times wouldn't it?  A single machine couldn't run a global economy.  I'm taking it to the far extremes just to clarify what I'm asking.
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:25:19
But with no bitcoins being mined?  
@_date: 2018-08-21 16:37:35
That's what you get for not HODLing
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:11:50
But it's mining with no new BTC generated so the incentive drops dramatically
@_date: 2018-08-06 03:57:22
But if there are 21 million bitcoin they will be mining for no blocks.  They wont be generating bitcoin anymore.  What is the incentive to run heavy CPU cycles to get nothing in return.

Why do these charts always looks so bad?  Pixelated AF. Content is good presentation could be better.
@_date: 2018-08-06 03:55:52
But thats the point that once there are 21mil BTC there will be no blocks mined right?
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:53:28
Thats assuming that the price is high enough for it to be worth the electricity cost to run the nodes.  If its not, hypothetically wouldnt the number of nodes drop significantly, making transaction times much slower?  Also the size of the blockchain will be massive at that point.  Maybe not an issue if data transfer rates continue to climb.

It's your art man!  Whatever you like!  Cool idea either way.
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:02:12
Might be better if you had them separate.  It looks like you're comparing them like they are the same.  Maybe put it in landscape orientation and put a line down the center.  Fiat on the left under "Problem" then a vertical line and "Solution" and the BTC address on the right.  I get what you were trying to do but its not really that clear.  I like it though.

says the guy who is going to have to eat his own dick if BTC doesn't turn around...
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:09:19
This ^ .  Supply goes down price goes up.  May be insignificant or substantial. No way to tell.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:34:37
Just from your gif and with out doing any research whatsoever.  The only feedback I'd give is that your plot is too smooth.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:09:29
HODLING* FTFY
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:00:39
I guess if you're trying to keep the analogy going you might be able to stretch it to be called a "financial institution" by using the definition of "an established law, practice, or custom."  still a stretch but would be better. BTC is definitely not a bank.

Today is my birthday too!  I had no idea... am I Satoshi and not know it?

Didn't expect to see the Willamette Week on I'll have to go grab that issue.
