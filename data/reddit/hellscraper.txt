I was rendered homeless and it has been a struggle ever since mtgox took off with my money =(
It has been a struggle alright, but thankfully I have found a friend who has let me sleep on his couch but I feel like I am intruding... I have two job interviews coming up! fingers crossed!

$5000 / $175 = 28.5
0.03 x 175 = $5.25
$5.25 x 28.5 = $149.6 + $100 one time fee = $250
No thanks.

"There is only 0.007 Bitcoin per person in the world."
how did you come up with this figure?
that number is more like 16.4 million in circulation / 7.53 billion = 0.00217 (without taking the bitcoins-lost-forever into consideration)
and if you did it to the 21million that will ever be in circulation it will be 0.0027

"If i cant pay it or find a buyer for the bitcoin I would effectively go bankrupt"
- this is impossible as there will always be a buyer/seller, and if there isn't - the price is probably zero in which case you don't have to pay tax on your $0 :)

The company will received 1 BTC and as soon as that 1BTC is received say it was worth $1000 USD, then it is converted to $1000 USD at that point in time. No volatility involved.
