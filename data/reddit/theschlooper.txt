I believe there was a period of time where Tulip bulbs were extremely valuable. Then once everyone figured out you could just grow them their value tanked into nothing.

@_date: 2017-08-07 16:28:37
When you compare 1 tulip bulb then to today's price, yes nothing.
Wikipedia: "[By 1636 tulips were traded on the exchanges of numerous Dutch towns and cities. This encouraged trading in tulips by all members of society; Mackay recounted people selling or trading their other possessions in order to speculate in the tulip market, such as an offer of 12 acres (49,000 m2) of land for one of two existing Semper Augustus bulbs, or a single bulb of the Viceroy that was purchased for a basket of goods (shown in table) worth 2,500 florins.[35]](
And the link you included was 50 Bulbs for 19.99 euros.

I'm not sure how inviting someone to learn about something new makes one look anti-social. If anything, its expressing the desire to share something special with another. If any sort of valuable communication is desirable, I would expect this sort of communication to be as such.
It's like when your Grandmother gives you socks when you specifically wanted that new GameGear with Iron Man and Man O' War game. I don't recall telling my g-ma "YOU SUCK GRANDMA. GO DIE IN A CAVE AND ROT." And if I did, by golly I was the one being anti-social. I didn't know it initially, but goodness those were some warm socks in the end that lasted me a few years. Even was able to slide around the house in them once they wore off those rubber soles on 'em.

This! Is a VERY good question! I wonder if anyone has attempted that thus far?
I know, however, when I took a car I purchased from a friend for $200 to get it registered under my name, they took the actual value of it on "their database" instead of the $200 that I paid and charged me sales tax on that. LAME. Ended up paying more sales tax than  I did for the car in the first place.

If bitcoins can buy me a tv, a car, some food, computer periferals, gift cards, games, clothes, phones, etc... I'm fine with putting money into it. Sure I'll still use cash to pay for services, but if I can get some profit out of this alternate currency to pay for certain things, I'm pleased.

I think the phone was the issue as I have a weird situation with my phone:
When I was trying to set up my Google Authenticator, I had accidentally navigated away from the page that the has tag was on. This effectively locked my account and now I have no access to it on a computer, as I don't know the hashtag and it's not linked to any phone. HOWEVER, I can still access my blockchain account from my phone (Strange?!) I can even transfer/accept money from my phone, even though it's not even hooked up to my blockchain account with the new GoogleAuthenticator hash or whatever. I went ahead and took all the coins out of that account and transfered it to another, after reading your loss
Sorry bro :(

It's always hit or miss - I wonder why they consider some to be High Risk offers and others to be legit? Maybe they received enough complaints and decided to finally go with the flow, realizing that just as we are at risk, they are at risk too. That's the name of the game with bitcoins anyway. Gotta suck it up.

Yes that is another setback, Coinbase does not offer limit orders. Sometimes, however, their prices are lower with the crazy fluctuating market. Though, usually, they are a tad higher due to the low fees. But they try to be competitive.

It seems that the way they've been "selling" bitcoins the past month or so has been really inefficient.. You buy hoping that the value of the btc in 3~4 days from the day you pay is the same/lower?

I would consider doing this. However, with the market fluctuating so quickly, the money I technically would have gained by re-selling the product probably would have made more of an impact if I had left it as bitcoins. The time it would take to purchase, ship, list, find a seller, strike a deal, get him to pick it up, then to buy the bitcoins again - the BTC would probably have gone up a good 10-20+ by then. Or more :p
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:44:42
Extremely easy, by the way. I've never made a deposite to a company, and they give you step by step instructions on how to do it all before you even drive to the bank. I loved it.

If anything, buy elsewhere (IE: Bitfloor, etc...) and sell on MTGox seeing as how they have a much higher trade.. But as for balancing? I don't know if others are going to go to MTGox's price or vise versa... either way it's up in the air, don't trust anyone, do what you think you should do.

Coinbase has it's perks. (Extraordinary Low Fees) The notion of Pay now, get whatever bitcoins depending on its value when the transaction comes through SUCKS and is TERRIBLE, but if you buy at the right time, it allows you to lock in a price and get those bitcoins. Although it does take some time, which is a downfall, if you're planning on making a small/large deposite just to hold anyway, it's very secure. I've purchased countless times from them and despite the 3-5 waiting period to have the funds deposited in the account, I've been happy.

Not sure if trolling... but pretty sure it's fake... trying not to be mean... choosing to say something...
**Doubt it.**
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:39:14
Maybe the 1000 numbers before the 44301 are just place holders?
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:17:50
I would.. but it's 3:17am, I'm doing homework and I don't feel like driving to CVS to make a deposit... :p
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:36:17
It seems that those people doing the micro transactions are still doing them? I keep seeing tons of .01 BTC transactions every time.....
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:27:44
As one who inadvertently suffers from this predicament, I second your opinion.

lolol - click the bitfloor button over to your right.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:24:56
Seems legit.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:21:12
Luckily it was just money earned from BTC (Cashed out), so I didn't really lose any hard earned money.
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:31:57
And down.
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:03:50
&lt;3 :D
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:22:49
yeah - It had been down a good while after MtGox got back up, I saw it when it got back up as the chart started flowing again
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:42:53
Holy crap wut?
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:47:55
I can't top that hoo hoo hoo.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:20:00
This seems too good to be true. I'd definitely buy in... but... too good...
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:23:44
TMI. I don't want to find him and ruin my streak ;)
@_date: 2013-08-15 00:05:45
either he's using a hackintosh or he's a linux guy? Hackintoshes are great if you have the right setup for it.. otherwise it's a pain.

I know you've taken down the site since, but if you think about making another, look up some of the free css layouts that make things wayyy easier when making your own site. It's simple and makes you look more professional without having any of the extra knowledge of programming a site.

I'm saying I ordered mine, and that's where it is. [*facepalm*](

Just watched Anatomy of a pump 'n dump. Couldn't help but giggle at the title.

@_date: 2013-04-11 20:43:45
Yes this ideology is correct. In other words, you didn't buy 1BTC, you bought however many BTC according to the value when the transaction goes through.

Usually the people hosting the bundle (In this case, EA) choose the charities
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:14:51
What about 100,044,301 in line?
(Edited to fix my queue :D)
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:22:13
I don't think he does.
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:48:42
Ahh, very true.
@_date: 2013-07-02 01:03:18
This very reason is why I've thoroughly enjoyed the attempts at recreating an eBay with bitcoin. IE: coingig.com, bitmit.com. etc...
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:10:35
Most [definitely](
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:26:03
Thanks for the further clarification in a clean manner :)
I will take that into consideration in my future posts!
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:24:43
You've lost your money pal, I'm sorry.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:08:14
Always compare their prices to the current price, and if their price will beat the others  price with their fees. 
Also, if it tells you to wait 24hours for the rolling period of amount of BTC available, just try again in 10 mins-1 hour. It will work eventually.
Their fees are extraordinarily low and if you purchase without ticking that box that says you understand the value of the bitcoin may change when the transfer goes through, your price gets locked in.
Just make sure never to tick that box, and they're very good.
This is all from personal experience. Coinbase brought me to the BTC market, and I've enjoyed it so far.
I do like the immediateness (AKA having bitcoins in ~1 hour) of Bitfloor.com and MtGox.com, but fees are psycho with them, personally.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:47:43
I was thinking 2 ULTRA BTC. Y'know, the whole 200.00 BTC value. Good Stuff...
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:55:19
Hah - Me too. Looks like we're in another bitfloor doozie... I haven't gotten my $$'s either
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:31:26
wish there was a way I could see where I'm at.
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:05:35
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:54:38
Not sure what you're talking about really, I haven't had that many problems.
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:47:07
Yeah I hope coinbase fixes it all... I really like the way it SEEMED they were doing business... but now.. Its... depressing.. my 25+ bitcoins are "pending" still..
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:26:16
Though, they could always blacklist addresses? Then again, with no need to validate an address, they could always just list the local McDonalds as the delivery address and just follow the tracking number and wait for its arrival.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:10:05
It's not exactly 150, but it's always this guy who sells and buys 120-180 BTC constantly, and that's what drives the price usually either up or down if you watch it.
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:43:30
Coinbase brought love into my life :3
@_date: 2013-07-21 00:33:06
This is true, not sure what I was thinking.
As I read his comment a second time, I completely missed the last half of his response XD

When I think of "JEWs" I think of Jimmy Eat World fans.. I don't think that group of people has much money :/
@_date: 2013-07-10 22:42:24
Depends what you gather your value is.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:35:29
I haven't lost any money, I have enjoyed supported BTC through and through thus far, though.
