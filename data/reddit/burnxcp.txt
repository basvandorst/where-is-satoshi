Seems 's response to this post here got deleted...here it is: 
This article is silly in a bunch of ways. But rather than write a long winded reply, I can sum up the principle reason this is a dumb response: Counterparty's mining is performed by bitcoin miners.
Piachu seems to believe burning energy is a benevolent process, and people will mine because they want to be different. Counterparty believes mining is a scarce and expensive resource, for which people will only burn energy if they have to.
Since Counterparty relies on Bitcoin, and bitcoin is a technology for whom energy is burned because of actual need (ie they're underserved), counterparty doesn't have to deal with need-based issues of Ethereum(who doesnt serve the underserved).
It's not complicated, and it's not a long-winded explanation of user preferences to "think different". It's simple economics that piachu continually fails to grasp because he thinks blockchains are a computer science innovation and not an economic innovation.

Directly from the whitepaper: 
"Drop Zone is a solution to the problem of restricted sales in censored markets.
The protocol and reference client encode the location and a brief description of a good onto The Blockchain. Those wishing to purchase the good can search for items within a user-requested radius. Sellers list a good as available within a geographic region, subject to some degree of precision, for the purpose of obfuscating their precise location. Goods are announced next to an expiration, a hashtag, and if space permits, a description. Once a buyer finds a good in a defined relative proximity, a secure communication channel is opened between the parties on the Bitcoin test network (“testnet”). Once negotiations are complete, the buyer sends payment to the seller via the address listed on the Bitcoin mainnet. This spend action establishes reputation for the buyer, and potentially for the seller. Once paid, the seller is to furnish the exact GPS coordinates of the good to the buyer (alongside a small note such as “Check in the crevice of the tree”). When the buyer successfully picks up the item at the specified location, the buyer then issues a receipt with a note by spending flake to the address of the original post. In this way, sellers receive a reputation score.
The solution is distributed, and as such provides nearly risk-free terms to sellers and drastically reduced risk to buyers."

There are reputation features built into the protocol, and additional reputation services will likely pop up. Drones may be an option. 
Enforcement of laws on the Buyers will be difficult and/or too resource intensive. The risk Buyers carry may be similar to torrenting music. 
The important thing to consider is that the risk in markets dealing with censored goods mostly falls on Sellers/Suppliers. Drop Zone drastically reduces the risk for Sellers. In the example of the illegal "Bible" market, the main "Bible" supplier faces significantly less risk when distributing "Bibles" to smaller sellers. This protocol's potential disruption of the greater supply chain is very interesting.

You have to give them credit for picking the right name for this project: allusion to centralized marketplaces where merchants couldn't scale, indifference to profit, and "open" due to failure of understanding the security implications of centralization

She's in over her head because she took on something she doesn't understand. She's already been [warned]( about permissioned ledgers, it's doubtful she'll make money with her current strategy. Even if she pivots, she'll lose credibility from the financial world as a leader in this space. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 05:07:42
In any other circumstance, I would put my money behind her. But this is Bitcoin, an entirely different beast. She threw her job at [The Mountain]( and may lose more than she bargained for.

Seems the Webonanza author quoted in the above article updated his post on Rootstock, pointing out some conflicting statements 
@_date: 2015-10-18 14:31:51
@_date: 2015-10-07 19:53:36
Many problems with this project. One cannot say that a sidechain has the same security as the Bitcoin Blockchain - it's an untested claim. Rootstock's homepage says they're using Roots as 'smart contract' fuel, and that Roots have “no other real-world use nor value” and there's "fixed exchange rate between sidechain’s fuel (Roots) and Bitcoin". 
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:14:30
It seems that 'Roots' are tokens on a Sidechain pegged to the value of Bitcoin. 
Pegging the value of smart contract 'fuel' to bitcoin presents future issues where the cost of smart contracts fluctuate with bitcoin. Cost of 'burning fuel' can be better mitigated and flexible with a different value token, where market forces determine value. 
Counterparty's XCP, for example, is decoupled from the value of btc and allows economic scalability as smart contracts evolve. The 'gas cost' (XCP burned) for smart contracts can be changed in the protocol for most efficient solution. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:00:13


How would it disincentivize users?  
If you have a protocol built on top of Bitcoin that adds a 'feature set' with variant complexities, a token for specific functionality offers a separation of concerns (a CSS to Bitcoin's HTML, if you will). 
A Sidechained 'token' may be susceptible to any security risks and/or economic attacks associated with NOT being on the main Bitcoin Blockchain. While Sidechains are new and untested, I'm skeptical they can offer the same security and benefits as The main Blockchain. 
Why not build a decentralized protocol on top of Bitcoin that can offer smart contracts, a DEx, asset creation, etc. that has the security of The main Blockchain underneath? Because of the complexity of this 'feature set', a separate token seems more efficient in the execution of these features.

I look forward to reading the white paper and getting a better understanding of how Rootstock will function. You guys have a solid team, and I hear nothing but great things about you, Diego. 
There's plenty of room in this space for multiple platforms that focus on offering similar and different types of value in financial technology, so I'm not worried about competitors to Counterparty. 
Every project should be heavily scrutinized in this space, as we're moving through unchartered territory. It's important to ask questions and point out things that seem incongruent in these projects, even when awesome teams are behind these projects. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:23:21
Counterparty does more than just smart contracts, as it has a decentralized exchange and asset/token creation. Counterparty is built on the Bitcoin Blockchain, not an untested Sidechain as Rootstock is proposing. Counterparty also has a flourishing community.
