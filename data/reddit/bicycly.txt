Faxes and attaching pictures and screenshots into excel spreadsheets and emailing them are just how we do things here.
I have stopped asking "what" or "why."

I send about $50 worth from Japan. Wish I could afford more.
Try to contact news agencies. Even bigger financial news/market reporting services that may be interested in reporting the Bitcoin aspect of it. If you can get your foot in the door with one big news place to pick up this story, other big national (or international) ones would take notice and pick it up as well.
Try calling agencies directly.  That way the address could be printed in the news story and it would get a lot more PR than this subreddit, ultimately ending in more money for those who need it.

The Japanese guys will have to fax around a schedule first and have endless meetings to plan a meeting to discuss what Bitcoin is. Then more meetings to plan other meetings about what to do in the future about it.
Source: I work in Japan as an engineer in a 99.9999% Japanese company. I am probably the sole employee that keeps it from being 100% Japanese.

I am an American living in Japan. I can't trade US securities through my local broker because they are scared of the IRS.  They at least let me trade any other country, all other brokers won't allow Americans to even open an account.
I have trouble opening accounts in the US because I have no US bank account and no US address to pass the know your customer tests.
So it is almost completely impossible for me to trade on the US market.

Rakuten is not just a an online shopping/e-commerce site. Though I absolutely hate their interface, they offer things recruiting services, banking, stock and securities brokerage, travel agent, etc. They basically do everything and just buy every kind of business available.

If you are exchanging money. As a Japan resident, I advise you to change your money into your home currency now while you are still in the airport.
I have flown back and forth countless times between Japan and the US, transferred at least more than $20,000 total, and I would say you'll have difficulty finding better rates.
If you are inside the terminal at Narita, you can still make it if you haven't already. Look for counters such as Mizuhoみずほ銀行.

Where did you convert your money?
Did you do it at the Japanese airport (most likely Narita) or at the exchange counter (such as travelex) at an airport in North America?
The differences in rates you get between exchange counters at US airports and the bank exchange counters in Japanese airports is huge. 
I have exchanged over $20,000 total over the past few years at these counters, and I recommend to always do the exchange at the Japanese airport. You will get a rate much closer to the market spot rate. Travelex has raised/lowered it more than 10 cents/yen against the spot rate before.

I edited my post above after you replied so you may not see it unless I reply here.  Reread my post if you have time. I hope popular non-bitcoin-niche will pick this story up.  If you can line a big enough one up, you can likely get them all.

I've traded over $70,000 total using LocalBitcoins and have nothing but positive experiences. 
Choosing payment methods, seller/buyer, and also communication are extremely important.

I have to use ATMs to deposit into my checking account at Bank of America when I am in the US.  If I deposit even once with a teller, I get an $8-9 fee for that month  (the fee is not every time I deposit, only once a month, if I make 1+ deposits in person)

3D prints can be high quality.  It all depends on the person who designed the 3d image, the slicing settings, and proper calibration.
A lot of hobby printers used by people who have no idea what they are doing is a cause for crappy quality.  Many of the hobby 3d printers are littered with annoying bugs, but you can make it work.  Industry-level printers are of course much nice, and can print different materials like fabric or metal (my old university has one).
My 3d printer is a hobby level printer and supposedly has a 100 micron accuracy, but experimentally I've only gotten down to a  little less than 400 microns.

One of my friends who works at JCB messaged me about it. He's pretty lacking in the technological know how (I recently had to explain to him what a router was, and how this whole time he could have "created his own wifi")  but he somehow knew about bitcoin.   He randomly messaged me a few weeks ago asking if I had heard about it before.
