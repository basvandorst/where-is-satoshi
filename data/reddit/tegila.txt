The thief only exist here because of their incompetence in building a proper multi-sign wallet. Giving wallet control to bitGone that won't have any responsibility while the user don't have any key to protect their money!
To me it sounds like, lets robe some unregulated guys until they ask for more government!

You also have to consider that people like to spend before they earn, and credit card create a big market for that. So the payment processors only need to adapt their business.

This can't lead to confusion too? Why not rename it to BShares?

What about BTS?

China is a country who have a ~STABLE currency (Yuan/Renminbi) related to the Dollar, and you don't like this, right? It's all about relativity. If you are looking by the dollar side you will see all the currencies changing a lot this days. That is not the other currency fault! It's how you expect an open market work. Money goes in, and goes out, and price float through this. What you are wanting is a market price based on bitcoin price, and it will happen. Just need to wait ;p

Some people can describe in literature very well but can't write one line of code because coding today still being more mathematics than literate.
I think this idea will mature the development process creating another person in the development process, that is the 'specification writer'. The one who will provide the coders with a very descriptive detail what the software is, and how all should work.
And than we can fill the gaps that was specified but still uncoded.
I don't know about this guys, but I like the idea. 
This week also another project appear here paying with bitcoins in github, very good idea :D

"What about the nuclear threats by giving the access to bitcoin to russia and north korea? We have to protect our people." hahaha

You are right about the censorship but if you think about the evolution of email spam you will see that anything that is 100% free on internet will be subject to users abuse and misuse.
The fee should be small enough to limit the spam without harm the users.

Sorry but it is not democracy. It's the open source, Internet and community.

I don't think so. The regulation will make it so hard that only people that do it today will keep doing but *maybe* using Bitcoin.
I believe more and more will emerge coin company to invest. Why invest in Google old-style stocks if we can invest direct in Bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin... etc. 
More startups should join this game with his own coins to crowdfunding and then paying interest to investors.

That is what centralisation of mining is causing. 
Normally when you start mining probably get interest in run a node to test or to run a single pool. 
Without this incentives only startups and people who have products built over block chain will need a full node :/
@_date: 2016-01-25 04:46:45


So it is: **50% + 50%/100 = 50.5%** right?
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:47:11
More centralisation coming soon...
Here in brazil get a Bitcoin is getting harder and harder. Many obstacles to buy and mining is not helping too =\. 
Long life to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:02:19
Centralized database is old and very expensive to scale. What they want know is how evolute to decentralised without losing the trust.
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:34:40
14. Bitcoin mining get more centralised
@_date: 2019-03-11 16:32:29


If you restart the blockchain and reduce the block size creating a new-bitcoin era that mostly relies on lightning network making on chain transactions very expensive. 
It’s totally possible to put it in the kernel at the same time you keep all the good qualities of bitcoin. (Except the price)

Maybe an insider can make a tunnel to an outside miner and calculate a cracked-block and send back. Anyway they don't trust each other, it's like a snake nest.

Oh, we have one purist here. Some Buddha master can live only with one coup of water. How about you?

Anyway, google translate was able to get the text by the picture and here are the results:
Input: 你知道什么是隔离见证 ( SegWit ) 吗 ?
Output: Do you know what is the seizure of the testimony (SegWit)?
I was in China 5 months ago and this translate app really don't work in a reasonable way. Only for the very basic sentence you can trust him.

Where bitcoins go when you convert them to sidechain-coins?
As I understand the bitcoins "outside" blockchain will be held in a M-to-N wallet where M will be the "liquid nodes" maintained by the interested parts.
So probably this nodes will probably hold some private keys and should be honey-pots to fintech hackers.
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:49:58
I don't know how to type this in Chinese characters. Sorry!
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:47:46
* SegWit: modern signature scheme to allow private M-to-N signatures be anonymous using a new algo
* Lightning: M-to-N timelocked offchain(with penalty) transactions scheme
* Liquid: Side-chain to use both above including a new node called `functionaries` who will check and validate the blocks that goes into and out from bitcoin.
I understand it well ?
Where this coins will stay when I transfer outside from bitcoin-blockchain to Liquid-blockchain? M-to-N timelocked ?
Liquid is like a 3rd-part-blockchain ?
Sorry for the many questions, I'm trying to make clear all this new things.

Never is a very strong word. If they got control over the main repositories, they can do a lot of things. Will be something different to what they have now but still some form of control.

Are you scared of the competitors?
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:30:47
Bitcoin is the only token without an owner/leader. Also is the first to be launch and keep being the most advanced technology in this area.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:13:59
ohh.. this scared me a lot...
the crypto ecosystem hates when something goes wrong within an exchange.

Localbitcoins don't work inside china for more than a year now, but this guys are using vpn to get around the Great Firewall.

Yes, but how?
@_date: 2016-10-08 02:26:16
Why the west can't forget about visa? Maybe a good travel to China to know about alipay can open your mind.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:46:08


Yes, they(the miners) always exchange one problem with another. It's the best way that they found to manipulate the markets after "China Ban on Bitcoin" Myth.
@_date: 2016-07-30 12:44:27
I'm a merchant and sorry in disagree with you. 
If you have more than 100k USD in an Bitcoin  exchange and are doing some hedge to lock your price in some currency and decide to finish your hedge and sell your bitcoins. Wait 6h can be too longer. I have seen Bitcoin drop more than 30% in 6h. 
I can tell you for sure its not even reasonable. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:08:58
I'm waiting more than 4h now to withdraw my money from bitfinex to my offline wallet. It's insane and now I pray to another cryptocurrency fix this BUG that is supported by Core and go to the mainstream. F* BTC

Business can feel when there is a raise in money flow on the streets and start adjust prices after a raise on demand backed by an easing on banks.

I heard it looks like empty blocks
@_date: 2016-07-30 12:30:02
Sorry Mr. Right. I forgot to say I add 20c of dollar as fee and for being critical in a place that can't hear the voice of criticism. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 12:33:15
Eth is not the only one my friend. But I'm sure we need teach many people before we start seeing we need concurrence to Bitcoin in order to start a new world. Sorry for coming too soon :*
@_date: 2016-07-30 12:38:50
You are right, that is incredible to all of us that this kind of technology now exists, but that is not a excuse to accept what is going on.
One month before if I send bitcoins to some address with 20c for tax it will get in the next block or two. 
In the last week I should wait more than 6h to get in the block chain even paying the same 20c.
If you look the mempool size chart will show how big is the problem today. 
It's not only the concern of crazy people anymore. It will impact all of us very soon.
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:51:42
We can make a contract on ethereum to automate this. Let me know if you want this.
