Your goal is noble, don't get me wrong, [but Bitcoin has seen an incoming (unconfirmed) transaction rate that's generally between 8 and 14 transactions per second.]( Heck, last check incoming transactions are over 20TPS.
While it does depend on the average transaction size and/or weight, the average throughput of bitcoin is around 3-4TPS without segwit fully implemented and used.
With full segwit use, we're in the 5-7TPS range.
It would certainly *help* in the scheme of things, but something needs to change. Even ignoring the fact that mid and low value transactions are being entirely suppressed at this point, segwit alone is (very likely) no longer enough to empty the mempool.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:48:28
Last check was when I wrote the post yesterday - for a while yesterday morning, TPS was over 30 across quite a few refreshes. My latest refresh just now shows 9.14TPS.
Don't mistake a temporary lull for a long-term average.

LN itself is not.
There are some wallets and services that operate in a custodial manner in order to take care of some of the potential overhead for you.
Most wallets are not custodial from my experience.

Yep, versions 0.15 and beyond had memory (mis)-use issues at least mostly solved so synch times have vastly improved.

Your summary is the more accurate version.
**Edit** The alternates still allow mining and user participation in exactly the same way as Bitcoin. Honestly, any of the primary 3 chains that originated from Bitcoin could arguably have some form of corporate financial motivation behind them, although in the case of BCH, the narrative that miners would have profited more from larger blocks doesn't make much sense because full blocks result in a larger block reward from collected fees. Smaller blocks would have profited miners more.
I'm not going to tell you that one coin or the other is perfect... none are.
With that being said, your statement that the common forks of BTC were just different visions is the closest to correct here.
Even though this edit will likely never be seen because of how old the post is, I still think it's pretty darn important so I'm ok yelling into the void here.

I wouldn't call it a lie... you truly can represent 1/3rd, or 1/5th, or 1/1000th of a Satoshi on LN.
The problem is if you don't get most of the matching 2/3rds, or 4/5ths, or 999/1000ths in other LN transactions before close, it means nothing.

You're right, but with all crypto, we're in an adaptation phase so deflationary events are going to be extraordinarily exaggerated and erratic. As far as use as money... That's a bit of a sore subject for me. I'll also say I agree, but that's an entirely different issue.
@_date: 2019-07-08 00:42:20


This is not an accurate assumption. I believe that BTC will have a relative price cap. I hold primarily as a hedge because I recognize I am human and my assumptions can be incorrect.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:41:10
You can represent fractions of sats on the lightning network because each channel state is only a representation of what would happen should the channel actually close. The main problem is if a channel ever *does* close with a fractional state, the system needs to (round / truncate) to the nearest sat because there's no way to represent it on-chain.
Fractional sat transactions *can* work, but it generally requires some planning on longer-lived channels.
So with that being said, it doesn't wholely invalidate your initial point.

a $1m bitcoin in 2019 would mean the total bitcoin market cap would be around $17Tn.
The current world M1 money supply is around $36Tn and broad money supply is around $90Tn.
Bitcoin as it stands right now is better classified as broad money, but given it's current monetary role, it would essentially have to supplant around 1/5th of all broad money in the world within 2 years to reach a (stable) 1m valuation.
Even if you consider Bitcoin on par with derivative investment as opposed to money supply - a $1m valuation would mean Bitcoin would have eaten somewhere between 1.3% and 3% of **all current investments made in the world** within 2 years. This doesn't include any other cryptocurrencies either.
I'm not saying that isn't eventually possible, but I strongly doubt that level of adaptation will happen within 2 years... and if it actually does, I think we're going to be in for one hell of a correction.

In your analogy is Egyptian Pounds = BCH... but that's not the only option.
If something like LTC is an option, it's like saying "would you rather store in GBP or Japanese Yen?" Both of these are viable options. The problem is if GBP becomes unusable without converting first to Yen, GBP loses it's own value because you'd be better off just storing in Yen in the first place.
Regardless of what alts you chose - Bitcoin is being slowly eroded by the other options. The fiat price itself hasn't turned backwards, but the biggest growth is happening elsewhere in the crypto space and many alts are growing against Bitcoin.

Crypto is a double edged sword.
The community started with amazing technical discussion because, in the beginning, the only people involved were technically savvy as they saw the value of the system through the lines of code they studied.
Crypto was never meant to be JUST for the technically savvy though, it was meant to be for everyone. Bitcoin has gained wide adoption as many non-technical users have climbed aboard who only see Bitcoin as "magical internet money."
I don't blame these users for their excitement and exuberance. Anyone that held since the beginning of 2017 has received about a 1500% ROI which is legitimately a lifetime of gains under normal circumstances.
Because of a lower % of technically literate on the code level and an insane ROI, the meme / price discussions have drowned out most technical discussions.
As Adrian Monk would say, "it's a gift ~~blessing~~... And a curse."
*Edit* - ty for the gold ! My other favorite form of magic internet money.

Look, I'm not a fan of Ver at all. I think that taxes are (generally) not theft - we get a lot of valuable services for what we pay in taxes and there should be a basic guarantee of safety and standards of living (This viewpoint does depend on your country though as there are some truly corrupt governments out there.) I also think that insider trading is a problem and a form of fraud.
At the same time - I can't ignore the fact that [the minimum fee to be accepted by a block right now is north of 800 sat/byte](
A simple 1-in-1-out transaction **with segwit** is still going to be over $5 and that's in the ideal circumstance that your wallet has the exact amount needed to send. Want to get change back? A 1-in-2 out transaction is another dollar. If you can't use segwit, those fees become $20 and $30 for the simplest possible transactions.
I think the bigger issue is with the core devs. They have stated that larger blocks cause centralization, but haven't released any studies, simulations, or academic papers which support their hypothesis. The community has basically had to accept and dissect their claims as stated. The evidence provided is as deep as a handful of tweets.
Meanwhile, most of the academic work I've seen done on cryptos has supported the notion that blocks can scale substantially further than is given credit. Yes, there are future storage and latency concerns, but hardware requirements are already high to run a node because you need a substantial amount of RAM to hold the mempool.
So let's say the opposite viewpoint in this debate grants that miner votes towards the block doubling were indeed heavily manipulated. If miner votes *can* be manipulated, then Bitcoin is already broken because that's the one mechanism to give feedback to adopt improvement algorithms.
Even if Roger is a scumbag, a coin that is loyal to the improvements requested by their community is functional. A coin that ignores user input to its own voting algorithm is inherently broken. The coins that are the most loyal custodians to their inputs will do better in the long run.

I'm not 100% sure right off hand, but I believe transaction balances are represented by unsigned long longs divided by 100000000.
The max value of an unsigned long long (64 bits) is 1.8x10^19 so if we increase to 9 decimal places we can only represent a maximum of 18M Bitcoin in a single UTXO.
While unlikely, it does represent an earth-shattering overflow error should someone amass almost all of the Bitcoin money supply.
For safety, we would have to add more bits to a transaction. If we move to an int128 (128 bit) implementation...  we have room for 19 more decimal places.
A normal single-in, single-out, non-segwit transaction is 224 bytes with a total of 2 long longs at 64 bits (or 8 bytes)
If we replace these amounts with int128s, we jump from 8 to 16 bytes in 2 places for a total gain of 16 bytes.
This would increase the same transaction from 224 bytes to 240 bytes.
So while the amount of data would increase, it wouldn't be that substantial.
**TLDR - Yes, it requires more data, but a pretty insignificant amount more data can cram almost 20 more decimal places.**
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:01:31
It would... It's just there to show that there is a vague potential issue at only 1 additional decimal point so it would just be better to move to a bigger data structure.

Or you could spend the same money buying peercoin at the current rate and make more money if the same ratio increase occurs without the additional risk of your hardware becoming even more obsolete, not mining enough coins in time for said increase to make it worthwhile before a corresponding difficulty jump, and without cluttering your home with potentially useless hardware...

Miners solve difficult problems to earn money. They should almoust be called "accountants" though, as their difficult problems involve verifying every transaction that has taken place in the last 10 minutes. They actually verify using a difficult discrete mathematical operation called hashing. For their work, they earn bitcoins from the system which are deposited into their account.
Because so many people constantly check that the balances in each account are correct, it's very difficult to cheat the system. It is possible to find a lot of dirty accountants all doing bad math to make things look like they add up, but because every accountant has an equal vote, it would require that there are more dirty accountants than good ones which is very hard to do. For this reason, it requires 51% of miners to do.
Miners have hardware devoted to solving these problems and in order to have a better chance at earning bitcoins, they can pool their resources together so if anyone solves the 10-minute problem, everyone in the pool gets part of the reward which is currently 25 bitcoins. Ghash, p2pool and BTC guild are all examples of these pools.

It's not different bitcoins coming into existence... it's basically a forgery of an existing bitcoin. So you're kind of right and you're kind of not right.
Think about a dollar bill. Printed on it is a serial number. Let's say that you have a copy machine that can make a perfect copy of it. You are then free to spend both but both serve as proof that one is false.
In the bitcoin environment, the serial number check occurs every 10 minutes (give or take) when a new block is generated and the later timestamped spend is proven false (this is the forged bill.) While the number of valid bitcoins stays the same, the number of bitcoins in circulation technically is n+1 for that brief 10 minute time frame (until the next check)
Also, as a minor technical clarification, not every coin has yet been created so we aren't to the ~21 million mark... In fact, [we're just a hair over 12.2 million right now.](
For that reason, the most accurate way to state the number of bitcoins in existence at the time of attack is ~12 million coins + some portion of some number of provably forged coins involved with the ghash transaction.

So I understand the decision to some degree, but Bitcoin is intended to be a currency. 
In some ways, it would be like saying nobody invested in the US dollar can comment on the US economy or strength of the dollar as a whole.
Yes, I fully understand that in addition to a currency, Bitcoin is also currently an investment towards more widespread adaptation of the currency in the future, and because of that reason, journalism can and will have a much greater effect on the value of the currency, but I think that due to the above factor, the author should just make it ***crystal clear*** of their investment.
Sure - blatant promotion sounds wrong... it's an open invite to a pump-and-dump run, but as long as the author is taking a fair and balanced stance and makes their investment clear, or is counterbalanced by a co-author not invested, I think they maintain the moral high-ground.
**Edit** - Also, nothing he said in is piece is ***incorrect*** - yes, Bitcoin is entirely capable of reducing barriers to entries, replacing credit cards, reducing fees, etc.. The likelihood of those benefits coming to fruition and his own optimism should have been better fettered against potential downsides and reasons to also be cautious. It still reads strongly like an opinion piece though and I think at least some of the social network rage is a bit over-the-top.

When arguing always question your own position and view the conflict from an adversary's angle. If you are wrong - admit it as soon as you realize it. 
Most major conflicts stem from one of these two factors. It will help you avoid doubling down on faulty information until you're dug in too deeply to get out, and it will help you understand when the misunderstanding isn't completely about what is being said.
Yes - conflicts are unavoidable, but it's bad policy to make enemies over simple misunderstandings.

Better yet, as a patent examiner, I'll forward the appropriate details to any relevant examiner on the case.
**Edit** yeah, after just taking a rather cursory glance at the specification, it appears cypherreddit is right and this is only news here because it mentions the word "Bitcoin."

The job of the attorney is (generally) to get as broad of coverage as possible for the client and rarely deals with reasonably representing the invention.
The job of the examiner is (basically) to slowly beat the attorney into submission with a more reasonable representation of the invention for allowance or to convince them it isn't allowable in the first place and get them to abandon the case.
I will say that bad patents do issue - even if the office has a 1% error rate, there are approx. 1,000,000 patents applied for each year in the US resulting in 10,000 patents with various sizes of errors - but a lot of people mistake news of "company x **applied for** this ridiculous patent" and "company x **just obtained** this ridiculous patent." If you start looking, you'll find the latter is much rarer than the former.

Then you have a lot of "news" to worry about:
That's 838 other published patent applications that specifically include the word "Bitcoin."
Not to mention the (likely) thousands of other applications that are broad enough to read upon something that deals with Bitcoin.
The fact of the matter is it's an application, not a patent, so There is no legal protection, applications almost always come in far more broad than the resultant allowance or they are denied outright, and only one potential implementation reads on a currency exchange that includes Bitcoin as the currency of exchange - not even as how the exchange works.
If this case were allowed as is - it would be newsworthy to Bitcoin. As is, it's just another patent application.

Because the one input to Bitcoin is the voting algorithm which is now being systematically ignored... Because there should be a standard set of clearly adopted implementations... Because it's taken months and it still hasn't even been included in the core wallet...
Take your pick.
 &gt; There a bunch of reference implementations too.
I mean, kind of, but as OP was also discussing, it depends on what version of Segwit you're trying to run with.
You're totally right that core should carefully implement something, but there's a major problem with their time frames. All companies want to be careful with their own hard-earned money.
If any dev team in the private world took almost 2 months deliver on an implementation that other companies should be able to  deliver on *immediately* (with leading knowledge of the upcoming proposal mind you,) that team would be fired on the spot.

This is only an effort to figure out what addresses are being used by the same user. It has no ability to expose a private key and doesn't put any coinage in danger.
This only affects those attempting to remain partially or fully anonymous.
You're right that the system is not anonymous, but it also doesn't give out the information of who owns what automatically. This protects against a specific attempt to deanonymize.
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:26:03
It depends, if the address has coinage in it, it may not be a great target because the unspent outputs still in that address may still be spent and connected to an existing address regardless of the new UTXO. That means that sitting and waiting will still potentially connect the two addresses.
On the other hand, think about if a user has a wallet they used to use that was dumped to an exchange. Let's also say they have a new wallet that they funded directly from an exchange.
If dust is sent to the empty old wallet and the owner sends the dust from an old wallet to a new one, outside parties can now connect at least some of the old wallet addresses to some of the new addresses.

A bitcoin wallet contains 100 addresses by default and more are generated if needed, so they can contain more.
If you use big-data analysis on all inputs and outputs of all of the transactions available on the blockchain, you can usually pin down which addresses are logically grouped together and sometimes can even pin down the real-world person that controls said wallet group.
Sometimes, it's unclear whether one or more addresses belong in a logical group. (i.e. sometimes it's clear that addresses A, B, and C belong to user 1, while it's unclear if D and E belong to user 1 or a different user altogether).
If someone sends a couple of satoshi to address E in this case, and find that sometime down the road, that dust was consolidated to one of those addresses, or grouped with a send that also included addresses A, B or C as inputs, it's clear that address E also belongs to the same user.
Additionally, if addresses D and E are currently empty and only dust is sent (just a couple of satoshi) there is a chance that the added address data will cost user 1 more in fees than it would by excluding the address altogether.
By allowing the blacklisting of UTXOs that only contain dust, this wallet avoids potential de-anonymization and fee attacks.

There may be some strange fringe cases where you aren't... And there's the possibility I'm not seeing another angle for the attack, but my impression is that under most circumstances, you should be ok if it's placed in an address with a non-zero balance.
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:49:54
Um, you don't lose your money with this attack... unless you have a very small amount of Bitcoin.
In the worst case, the fee is approximately multiplied by ~140%. A 1sat/byte fee for a simple segwit transaction is currently around a penny and a 10sat/byte fee is around a dime.
Even if you pay the 10sat/byte rate, the transaction fee would increase to 14 cents... not your entire balance.
This is not to mention the fact that it costs the attacker a similar amount in fees to send the dust in the first place - thus disincentivising this as a pure economic attack.

Even though it's a Sata 3.0 6Gb/s disk, I think it's on a 3Gb/s connection.

The second is that electricity is ridiculously cheap there so some of the more wealthy people are mining crypto as much as possible so there is an available liquid pool.

One working theory I have is that episodes of hyperinflation will be drastically exacerbated by alternative currencies (i.e. crypto) as mass printing of a state-sponsored currency will not only increase supply for it, but simultaneously reduce demand for it based on lack of faith.
Can you comment on the frequency that you see various forms of cryptocurrencies appearing and how that's changed during the current bout of hyperinflation?
How frequently do you hear of or see people who are earning their salary / paycheck in the form of a cryptocurrency?
I'm curious, because in theory, with a mathematically provable / sound alternative, this could be the start of a complete collapse of a currency with an entirely nationwide uptake of one or more cryptos in its stead. I'm just wondering about some of the additional pressures that are influencing supply and demand.

~~I would recommend against the idea.~~ See edit below.
Another reddit user tore that specific turbine a new exhaust hole a while back.
I'll try to find the post, but the gist of it was that there is no possible way that turbine can generate the power it claims to. The reason the amount of water looks incredibly small is because it is... It's far too small in fact.
For instance the [Malibu hydro power plant]( in BC drops water 1250 feet in a penstock at up to 600 PSI to generate... 580KW
Think about it... Sure, that's around 35x the amount of power you want... But an installation that large is *only* 35x the amount of power.
The power output is based on flow rate and height difference. I am highly skeptical that you would ever get a generator spinning fast enough to generate that type of power with the setup in the video, even if the generator is electrically capable of 15KW.
Especially given a drop of just a few feet. Vortex or not.
**Edit** - I couldn't find the post and another user pointed out that the electric yield may actually be in the correct ballpark so I'm going to assume I misremembered the initial post and it was railing ng against his specific setup proposal and not the turbine itself.

It's the primary coin on Scrypt and merge-mining with Doge. LTC and Doge have a larger percentage share of all Scrypt hashrate than BTC does on SHA-256. Both are now ASIC mined so specialized hardware is required to mine efficiently on either.
If you wanted to create a mining pool that had 50% of all LTC mining power, it would currently cost around $205M for the hardware and consume around 644MW
Sure, if you wanted to do the same with BTC, it would cost 19B and consume 68TW which is roughly 100x more on both fronts... But here's the kicker...
Buying enough hardware to attack the network would be akin to lighting your entire investment on fire as, over time, it would de-value the currency itself.
It's almost, but nearly as unlikely that someone will wake up and light $205M on fire as it is that someone will light $19B on fire.
It's clear that the security prospect of cryptocurrencies has a lograthmic curve.
For those reasons, the security prospects of BTC are, at best, marginally better than LTC.

Because of the way segwit works, a lot of Bitcoin transactions were replayed on the Bitcoin Cash network which sends it to an anyone-can-spend address.
The fact that happens does mean that some is either ignored or at least not carefully handled.
With that being said, if you converted to a new segwit address and sent your own coins there only to find you accidentally burned your BCH, you may want to check the new address because one of the miners took all of the anyone-can-spend coins and sent every one they could to the intended recipient.

Fair enough... I'm humble enough to admit when I'm wrong and it looks like that's the case here.
Perhaps it was their own particular setup that was at fault and I'm not remembering the initial post correctly.
I know in the wind energy field there are a lot of small-scale generators that claim to generate a lot of energy, but when you break down the technicals and the physics itself, you quickly find you need to place that turbine on a 150 foot tower in exactly 30mph winds to achieve the rated power and the dropoff as wind-speed declines is a power-of-three reduction. That means a 15MPH wind will only see around 1/8th of the energy production and 7MPH winds may not even be enough to start the turbine or trickle-charge a battery.
Wind as we know it is also a maximum of less than 40% efficient at converting wind energy to electricity. It looks like Hydro is much better in terms of efficiency.
Perhaps my dislike of some less-than-reputable wind turbine manufacturers that overstate their power generation levels is unfairly rubbing off on small-scale hydro.

I agree, and something as simple as clients implementing [UTXO checkpoints]( would alleviate the need for all computers to persist all transactions.
If clients optionally enabled a UTXO checkpoint and updated it, a user could chose to persist the entire blockchain or just parts.
That's one of a few different options, but it's one of the simplest.


Sorry I meant Windows 7.
And to the contrary, by not upgrading the block size because SegWit isn't 100% used, even though the mempool is habitually full means that everyone pays higher sat/byte fees than otherwise necessary.
A user inefficiently using 226 bytes instead of 181 bytes still means that **nobody else** is able to use the "wasted" 45 bytes.
It's a very apt analogy, it's too bad you don't see that.


Yes, and while it very slowly improves, it will also throw under the bus users who demand a network with more reasonable transaction fees for their needs. The higher the fees go, the higher the percentage of users you alienate from the network.


I would rather actually see evidence of either real-world bottlenecks. This statement has routinely never been backed up by any level of testing or simulation.
Testing that has been done has shown a previous bottleneck around the 22MB range that was induced because of lack of parallelization with the way the core client was initially written. That has been fixed in BCH implementations and is no longer a bottleneck.
It's also hard to be convinced of centralization issues when the median network speed has increased more than 10x since the block debate first started.
Perhaps I could be convinced with simulation data that the BCH approach is too aggressive, but it's similarly ridiculous to not acknowledge the clear improvements in computing that would allow a far larger network to flourish than what is currently happening on BTC.
Until the "brainless" statement is backed up with convincing data, it remains a relatively empty statement.




And I think that's fair. Cryptocurrency is a relatively new technology. I agree that things should be done responsibly as well. It's just a shame that people are being put down and demonized for navigating and interpreting this new territory in a slightly different way.

I absolutely agree that Hal is probably the most likely candidate to actually be Satoshi.
He probably has a point that Bitcoin may not reach a global 100%-of-transaction scale.
With that being said, Bitcoin should still strive to envelop as many transactions as it is capable.
By putting a line in the sand here and saying we cannot possibly go further than 1MB base while ignoring the fact that network propagation speeds have increased 10x since the scaling debate first heated up, we are artifically limiting what is possible on the network itself.
I think that the transaction volume at the 1MB + SegWit block size isn't enough of a blip in world transaction volume for Hal's vision in that post to even come true here. Most banks aren't going to bother implementing an off-chain reserve payment solution backed by BTC because the volume is still far too small.
We may never reach 100% saturation, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to improve our current benchmark.

Absolutely they are real users, but the fact they will have issues transacting directly on BTC means that it isn't the BTC network that is becoming more valuable, it means the custodial service is valuable.
Sure, a portion of that value will be lended to the base currency in a reserve currency situation, but most of the value generated is directly because of, and reflected in the custodial service itself.


Yes, the mempool just barely clears [during the times with the lowest usage]( This is primarily when it's afternoon over the Pacific Ocean and especially over the weekend.
In the last 24 hours, there were 10 blocks that actually cleared the mempool. That's only 7%. That reflects the usage of a *Sunday*... the slowest day of the week on average.
Also, You never addressed the point I made before. 33.59% of users are still running Windows XP. This doesn't mean that Microsoft should just refuse to create the next version of Windows untill literally everybody is on Windows 10, but that appears to be the false choice this line of reasoning gives.
Even though not everyone has converted, there is *still demand* for something better and faster and upgrading will still add value to the network.
There could dozens of reasons people aren't upgrading. Maybe they don't know. Maybe they're not a security expert and worry that they may download a malicious version so they want to stick with what they have. Maybe they have a programming project that's only compatible with an older API.
Expecting everyone to upgrade is like expecting all users to be experts and to only use the network in a specific and expected way.
That isn't the reality.
If Microsoft stopped making new versions of Windows until everyone converted to the new one, they'd be out of business long ago because they'd be doing nothing to create additional value.


The fact that blocks are currently 95% full on average does not support this view.
Even if you personally forced everyone remaining to convert to SegWit transactions, that average would be approximately 73%.
Not a lot of room for many more transactions even in idealized circumstances.

Yeah, I really wanted to set up a wind turbine back in the day and started calculating some realistic power curves for existing micro wind (300-1000W range)
I quickly realized I could find how far off their claims were given the dimensions of the blades.
Most of the time the rated power was the max output that would never be seen without a perfectly stable wind-speed at 25+ MPH.
It also seemed like you would never see a payback without going into the 2-5KW range and even that had a long break-even that relied on being spendthrifty with the setup as well.

I think a fair chunk of the BCH camp recognizes the risks of larger blocksize and is raising them in view of what a realistic trade-off would be.
I have heard the mantra that even a 1MB block size is dangerous, but BTC has had a 1MB base block size pretty regularly with an additional ~.2 MB of sig data for almost 2 years and it has had (few/no) discernable signs of having propagation issues. There has also been scary little published simulation or testing by BTC to figure out what a current safe trade-off is.
I have a strong worry that it was the utility of the payment network itself that got BTC near the price peak and I worry that it has far less room to expand from here. New York City taxi medallions obtained a high price off of their utility and rarity and were perceived as a store of value, [but a ~10% decrease in utility resulted in a ~80% price drop.]( I don't think the utility of the BTC network has necessarily dropped, but there is a bit of a cap.
With that said, I'm not going to sell off the BTC I own anytime soon... I think it will still likely fare better than Fiat. I just also think it may be wise to diversify to a few runner-up picks as well.

One of the working theories is that Bitfinex was trying to remain solvent while looking for a new bank backer. If there was a constant stream of ppl getting into various cryptos and buying into their exchange, they could continue to pay everyone out.
One way to keep demand up is keep price hype up.
Bitfinex basically made and controlls tether and it appears it was heavily used to prop up the price of certain cryptocurrencies.
Unfortunately, it may mean that we're due for a bit of a correction now that the cracks in Tether and Bitfinex are starting to blow open.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:18:02
Here - you're missing this: \\
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:20:42
First off... Minor correction. There are 21M coins and 100,000,000 sats per BTC so there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 sats (2.1 instead of 21 quadrillion)
So let's say this could hypothetically happen. In that world, miners would have to accept no fee at least some of the time, otherwise most of these sats would just pay fees.
These transactions would require no change address, so a 1-in-1-out SegWit transaction, which weighs in at around 181bytes, would mean your computer would have to generate and send 337 Petabytes of information to the network.
On a typical 200MB/sec connection, this would take approximately 57 years.
Once there, they would start to fill the mempools of computers on the network. *If* every transaction arrived, none were dropped, and no other transaction was received, it would take approximately 6.9 million years worth of block space to process.
A problem would arise far before that though... Computers have finite memory so poorly configured nodes would crash while most nodes would just start dropping transactions.
Because transactions are dropped lowest-fee first, your 0-sat transactions would likely never be processed. Many nodes wouldn't even accept a 0-fee transaction.
There would be a slight slowdown among nodes that accept 0-fee while you're transmitting, but the network would remain mostly unaffected.
If you chose to up fees to where miners would eventually accept them (1 sat) you could time batches so the mempool doesn't overrun, but each 1 sat sent would require 1 sat *per byte* in fees. Because of this, it would cost 20.884M BTC ($229B) in fees to send around 115K ($1.2B) worth of BTC...
Not super efficient.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:49:23


Really? No role whatsoever? There are hundreds of external factors that influence price and the country with the highest GDP which is - at best lukewarm (on average) to the newest administration and it's economic policy...
They get a few days off to visit with family and you don't expect any movement at all? That seems pretty short sighted.
As far as volume goes - today isn't yet far out of the ordinary. I'm not saying it won't be by the end of the day - but the highest volume is on US-based exchanges.
Honestly - the two most likely candidates for being the biggest contributors based on the current volume are either further tether manipulation on finex or family coming back from the holidays.
Are there more factors - absolutely. Short term price-manipulation will always be a part of the equation. With that being said - I wouldn't underestimate the influence of family. I also wouldn't underestimate the probability that some component of the price gain could be market factors that create a long-term bubble.

You're referring specifically to [Braess's paradox]( which notes that conditions must be met where users are not at an ideal Nash equilibrium.
Adding or reducing block size won't substantially change the structure of the connections so there are gaps in that correlary. 
Regardless, I'll grant that it will probably, *temporarily* change the efficiency with which they are used.
The primary factor weighing against fees is developmental costs for optimization. You can either pay the developmental costs up front for your system to batch / use LN / etc. or you can use the base layer and pay more.
Upon a fresh doubling of the block size, new users to the system may be less incentivized at first to undergo these upfront costs, but there is still negative incentive for most companies who have already paid developmental costs to revert back to their old ways. Even at lower fee rates, batching and other space-saving techniques still save them money.
I agree that the interim period before fee pressure rises to equivalent levels will not see 100% efficiency with the increase, however:
Down the road, we'll eventually see the exact same fee pressure on a larger block size. That same fee pressure will cause the exact same optimizations to occur and we will reach a new equilibrium at 2x the throughput with even more room to grow other layers from.

I can only see this happening in that short of a term if the market is vastly overvalued and almost all alts are widely abandoned.

I don't understand... If you reach full blocks again, wouldn't you have the same fee pressure to optimize, but with double the throughput now?
If users pay per byte, wouldn't you double the cost to spam a full block?
I can't see how higher supply and the same demand wouldn't result in a lower equilibrium price.


Wait, in a peer-to-peer network, if you exclusively prune nodes that are having latency issues, you're going to actually speed up the overall propagation. This relates to an old [ethereum uncle rate statistic post](
In fact, if a node barely has enough bandwidth to keep up, by nature it would be behaving in a very leechy manner.
I think it's important to pay attention to the node set available and make sure that any proposed increase would result in a statistically non-gamable node set, but considering network speeds have approximately doubled from early 2017, I have a hard time seeing how a 2MB base block would decentralize the network in any meaningful way.

^ This ^
If you want to know what they are in practice, you need to turn to the actual code.
If you want to know what they are in english, basically miners have the right to create a given number of bitcoin out of nothing for successfully mining a block and address them to themselves.
The limit is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which is approximately 4 years of block time. The limit starts at 50 and is continuously cut in half until it reaches 1 satoshi. After that 4 year period, rewards go to nothing (miner fees only.)
The schedule is something like this:
Jan 3, 2009 - Nov 28, 2012:     **50 BTC reward.**
through July 09, 2016:     **25 BTC reward.**
through May 2020 (approx):    **12.5 BTC reward.**
through May 2024 (approx):    **6.25 BTC reward.**
The inflation rate is set more-or-less by these numbers.
There are currently around 17.6M BTC in circulation. Meanwhile, every 10 minutes on average, 12.5 Bitcoin are created as a mining reward.
12.5 BTC * 6 blocks / hours * 24 hours / day * 365.25 days / year = 657,450 new BTC minted every year at the current rate.
657,450 / 17,640,000 = a supply increase of 3.73% as of right now.
Because each block increases the supply, the very last block of this reward level will have an effective inflation rate reduced to 3.58%
The very first block of the next reward level which is currently predicted to happen around [late May of next year]( will see an effective reduction in the inflation rate to 1.79%

It absolutely is. The signature data is what is being removed from the base block as weighted segregated witness data.
The only way to get to a 4MB block is if a substantial percentage of transactions in a block are multi-input, multi-output transactions.
These types of transactions happen, but for an average end-user, it's difficult to plan to batch some transactions together under typical use-cases.
Further, it is my current understanding that when implemented, Schnorr signatures effectively combine witness data for the set of inputs and as well as the set of outputs. *I believe* this will effectively cap the effective block size at around 1.7MB with 100% segwit and 100% Schnorr usage.

It's not increased demand, it's [elastic demand.](
There is higher demand at lower fee rates, but that doesn't change the basic economic fact that if you increase the supply, the price equilibrium will go down.
On top of that, I don't see why companies that have already optimized would suddenly un-optomize. It still saves them money to transact less on-chain and that mechanism has already been developed. I would think they would need a better reason to convert back to transacting on chain.


I actually don't know who's nodes will be pruned. I'm an end user with a relatively cheap consumer-grade connection that I'm sharing with all 8 computers in my household.
In spite of that, I rarely exceed 3% of my throughput, and when I do, it's usually because another computer is doing something much larger than bitcoind is.
It looks like I could handle 11.4MB blocks and still have a 3x safety margin.

A 1.5 - 1.7MB block size will likely be the final average size with 100% SegWit usage.
SegWit separates the signature data of each signed UTXO so in order to use more than the average amount of segwit space, you would have to reduce the total number of UTXOs on the network. The number of users sets the floor for minimum set of UTXOs and that floor is only going to increase. If you try and reduce the set further, you have to kick users off of the network. Because of the effects of entropy on this system, the average number of outputs will always be slightly larger than the number of inputs.
That's a mathematical certainty.
Also, SegWit allows for users to use or not use blockchain in the preferred (SegWit) way. Just because one user does not use SegWit, does not mean that there isn't demand for others.
In fact, because percent-of-transactions does not equal percent-of-users, there's a chance that ignoring the debate is alienating the majority of users. Especially with transactions being offloaded to the LN.
I'm not saying that certainly is the case, but waiting for 100% usage would be like waiting for everybody in the world to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10.
Heck... [1 out of every 200 Windows computers are still running Vista](
That doesn't mean we should stick with it as the only solution until it reaches 0%
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:47:37
I'm fully conceding that after a blocksize increase, there will not immediately be 100% efficiency in the increase of transactional throughput.
What I am saying is that as the number of transactions increase, we will eventually reach a point where the summation of the fee pressure becomes identical to what it is now.
At that point, we will have doubled capacity.
Raising the block size will have diminishing returns - but because you can only improve to the point of a theoretical ideal, optimizations will also have diminishing returns.
Because of this, both are needed.
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:43:42
You're both correct.
If the blocksize gets too large, only institutions will run nodes.
At the same time, I fail to see the danger of this happening if the block limit is raised to 2MB or even 4MB.
With 100% segwit usage, a 4MB base block would average around 6MB including witness data / block. That comes out to be 316GB / year. You could store the entire blockchain plus an entire future decade worth of transactions at that level on a 4TB hard drive.
I'm just some random dude on the internet and I have 4TB in solid state lying around I'd put up *today* to support that increase.
I don't think many people think the system should be turned up to 11, but it should at least be turned up to 2.

I'm not 100% sure blockchain is suited to the needs of Ethereum. There's an insane amount of contract data. I'm not exactly going to bet against it, but storing contracts on a blockchain for the sake of storing may result in computing more expensive than just having the dedicated server in the first place.
Regardless, I don't see how an increase to 2MB is "outpacing infrastructure" when average internet speed has [more than doubled]( since [segwit was first implemented.](




I haven't heard anyone in this thread recommend a 1TB blocksize (i.e. we aren't suddenly pushing to go to a million lanes.) It's my impression that we've been discussing 2MB for the base layer.
I would disagree that 1MB as a base layer is optimal. It seems like new users and services are, at least to some degree, being turned off by things like fee variability. There are certainly ways around it, but some solutions get very complex.
Regardless - I really think a change is appropriate now so a new round of investment and usage can begin and the efficiency optimization can happen later... but I understand if you don't agree with that - I'd just like to know if you do disagree, what conditions would indicate to you that the conditions are appropriate for an increase?

I'm gonna have to stop you right there.
I bought in at around $130 / coin after the price crash from around $250... The price went all the way down to $90 / coin. I wouldn't call myself wrong in any way for that investment.
I bought more at $650 / coin after the MtGox crash where it peaked at $1250. The price continued down to $250 at it's lowest. I also wouldn't call myself wrong in any way for that investment.
We're all speculating to some degree on blockchain technology by being in the market in the first place. Some of us are trying to play the 0-sum game to make short term gain and some of us are in it for the long haul. Regardless, we're all speculating that there's plenty of room to grow with the technology... and guess what - there still is.
Playing the Captain Obvious game of "well you should have sold at $5000 and re-bought now... or at some unknown future low" is more ridiculous and unhelpful than actually speaking to the fundamentals behind Bitcoin that give it value in the first place.
I'm proudly in my long position through all of this China nonsense because the Bitcoin currency is resistant to government interference, and because it's provably trustworthy.
Bitcoin is absolutely about speculation in a new currency type and while you have a minor point about people spouting "it will rise" without stating a cause - the cause is clear. The fundamental characteristics of bitcoin haven't changed and while the crypto market is a bit more crowded and the rise may be slower, it will continue to rise. If you can't handle the wrenches that get thrown in the price, my advice is buy... store your crypto in cold storage... delete all price tracking apps, and check back in 2020.

The splits concern me... but not gravely.
I would like bitcoin itself to succeed. I don't care what chain succeeds because I'm maintaining my stake in both currently and will maintain my stake in all 3 if another split occurs.
If a 2x split happens and evidence surfaces that the blocksize will stay exactly the same or decrease... which is what would be required... I would happily move all in on the other two chains - because they will remain usable.
If blocksize becomes a huge problem or appears as if it will become a huge problem in the future, I'll happily move all in on core... and probably a bit on a bitcoin offshoot that limits transaction types and thus is a coin that remains of little weight.
If miner hijacking runs rampant, I'll happily move all in on core again... and probably a certain bitcoin offshoot that has a built in multi-factor voting system so decisions like this can be done quite... expeditiously.
Just saying these were "closed door" meetings and talking about how this all "doesn't make sense" sounds [a bit like this]( than something substantive. It's not to say I won't be on the lookout for indicators that this truly is a hijacking and will act accordingly.

I finally see where you're coming from at least. And despite the toxic tone, I do appreciate the information. Unfortunately, running a node isn't necessarily indicative of someone being a Bitcoin user... The bigger issue is there's no guarantee of a 1:1 ratio of people to nodes. Someone owning 0 Bitcoin and running a full wallet would have the same weight as someone with 40,000 btc and a single node and that would have the same weight as 1/60th of an IT professional that set up a computer lab to run full nodes across the whole lab in off hours. Anyone with economic incentive to pad "votes" could go buy a bunch of rasbery pis to fake support. Heck... Connect through vpns and suddenly, you look like hundreds or thousands of people globally.
Moreover, there really is no way to specifically vote for intension while running a node and there's no great way to vote as a user... Except by maybe customizing a transaction script in your signature.
Honestly... I have 4 computers with about a 20% uptime between them... All running a 14.2 full node. I never perceived my software choice as a vote in the system, and I'm borderline agnostic but leaning slightly towards 2x. 
Now that I know some people perceive 14.2 as a vote against 2x,  I may swap wallets. I don't think it really matters though because in reality, there's no PoS so a "user" vote could be accurate or it could be heavily spoofed / padded and mean very little.
If anything... The only true vote against 2x is 15.0 because of the 2x disconnection update (if that made it in to the final release... Core didn't seem to document the change in the update.) That matter is also complicated by the fact that v15 fixes a major bug so it's hard to tell the reason for update.
As far as the last response being flippant... You get out what you put in. 
All I asked is what source you were using to discuss your "economic majority" and here we are 7 comments deep before you respond.
And whether or not you see it doesn't really bother me. Bitcoin is more about the community.

To be completely fair to both sides - Segwit / LN themselves are not a corporate layer. The true worry comes in with an insurance system which guarantees immediate processing for a fee. I'm not going to make assumptions as to how likely / unlikely that may be here. What I will say is there are two problems with a later insurance solution: 1 - an insurance system would, by it's own nature, be centralized and therefore attackable (both politically and algorithmically) 2 - an insurance system would require trust in the entity itself in a network designed to specifically not require trust.
Segwit / LN themselves shouldn't be a major concern - just be wary of possible "solutions" down the road.

[2x support is what met the threshold... Not segwit alone](
And a larger blocksize hurts miner profits because the average on-chain fee is lower. The motivation for miners would be to keep blocksize small. Please, could you explain the diobolical scheme behind miners voting for larger blocks... Why should they be disqualified if raising blocksize is antithetical to their bottom line?
It seems that 2x would probably have larger user support to force the hands of so many miners.

The hash of a snapshot would be statistically impossible to match and be correct so it would need to be centrally hard coded by the developer and hard forked for everyone.

I mean... kind of. The true compromise was the Segwit2x agreement. Because of a code bug, that never activated. Also [The block size will, only in obscenely rare circumstance, ever reach 4MB]( That would literally require a block nearly full of 100 input 1 output transactions. If you had that level of consolidation for more than just a couple of blocks, one address would contain all BTC. The average with 100% segwit usage will probably only ever be 1.5-1.7MB.


[I mostly covered that here](
I suppose you and I have different pain points.


I agree that the costs associated with a node should be reasonable. I'm not saying scale to infinity... I'm saying scale *at least* with respect to the technology increases that have happened. I absolutely agree that decentralization is important, but I really think you're position is that any trade off which decreases any node count is "centralization" when in reality, a centralized network is one that can be attacked because available nodes can collude against the rest of the network.
I just don't see any evidence of that.
If you know of literature dealing with attacks stemming from increasing the block size to 2, or 4, or even 16MB, I'd love to give it a read... I just know my experience is that I haven't seen any credible threats.


While you have a point, at the same time, high fees also reduce the utility of the network.
I'm pretty sure an economist given enough time could model a Bitcoin transaction exactly as a service with elastic demand. The problem you run into is that as the price goes up, the utility of the network itself goes down.
It really seems to me like a double edged sword that cuts down transaction sizes at one end and cuts network value at the other.
I actually think some level of consolidation is good, but I think that has become way to extreme at least at times.


Because 2x never activated, the 8M proposal (which only had 40% support at the time) essentially went up against Segwit alone. That probably became the most contentious fork in crypto history, yet I don't think I read about anyone losing coin or anything similar. In fact, everyone I know had the freedom to place bets on the side they thought would win out.
Even in the worst cases, a truly contentious hard fork in my view hasn't ever done a whole lot of damage to the ecosystem.
There have been people like CW who thought they were powerful in a decentralized system and instead got trounced by it.


I don't necessarily think we should strive specifically to make blocks "not full," I think we should strive to give users as much ability to make transactions as the network allows.
If the current computing environment only allows 2MB or 4MB base blocks, we have room to grow and we can revisit when technology has again experienced an 10x increase in throughput...
I mean... because there's been a 10x increase in throughput since the last time this debate happened...


I don't think the base layer is something that's "not worth trying to increase in the first place." I think other types of improvements are quite good in fact. With that being said, there's absolutely a balance that can be struck.
I think it would be better if people had the freedom to choose an on or off chain transaction whenever possible. Honestly, I feel like I'm almost forced onto LN with BTC in some cases and the payment methodology runs completely counter to current payment methods.
You have to plan capacity and payments ahead of time with LN instead of just paying on-the-spot and I haven't found a place nearby I solicit that both accepts LN and that I frequent enough to bother opening a channel to.
Maybe I'm alone in that experience - I've only tried to pay with lightning once and I didn't have a path so I just paid with credit.


I mean, if you don't prioritize it, that's fine. I think a lot of things have changed immensely since the last time the debate was had.
I'd really like for there to be more capacity and I think there's still a clear and easy solution.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.

And at that point, we're probably 2-4 decades down the road. I have no idea what processing will be like at that point... We may be fully quantum by then and on a new sig algorithm.
With that being said, if the technology remains more similar, hard drive sizes will likely be in the 50TB - 500PB range in that time frame depending on when and how sharp the Moore's falloff is.
Similarly, average Internet speeds will likely be in the 250Mb - 250Tb/s range... Again, depending on actual length of time and how sharply the Moore's falloff is.
I think only a chunk of the low end of those estimations couldn't scale to 1TB. Even so, I think we should respect what the technology is capable of.


BCH was not the initial scaled agreement. If it would have happened, S2X would have been the majority. I think the 8x proposal maxed at 40% support before the vote so of course BCH was the minority fork.

While they do make some interesting points, they don't really discuss how they come up with their RAM estimates and they base it off of a UTXO set size of 2GB.
At the time of the paper,  the UTXO set was only about 50MB. 
I'm not sure how they came up with their estimate, but there used to be some big memory inefficiencies with previous versions so measuring memory usage as a proxy for UTXO set size may have yielded absurd numbers.
Version 0.15 had massive memory efficiency improvements which likely obsoletes most of these estimations.

The problem you run into is different transactions have different values to different people. The only way that segwit fully scales, is if everybody uses it in an expected and prefered way.
On the other hand, a block size increase is a proportional throughput increase, despite how each individual uses it.
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:51:28


A 1TB blocksize would mean (approximately) that every human being on the face of the earth could post a transaction every 20 minutes. 72 transactions a day.


Yes and no - not increasing the blocksize is also denying that substantial engineering improvements have been made to hardware and network throughput. I think improving the protocol is great - and we can do other things besides increase the blocksize, but there's clearly room for transactional throughput from reasonable blocksize increases as well.
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:15:25
And I think that improvements to the base protocol are also (generally) a good thing.
With that being said, transmission speed is one of the major bottlenecks to directly scaling blocksize, but transmission speed is increasing in leaps and bounds... So while other improvements can be made, an obvious improvement to throughput would also to be to scale with the available technology.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:01:28
There's an interesting economic equilibrium going on though and if you Google a halvening chart, you can see it in action.
When there are fewer coins as a block reward, the supply side goes down while the demand side doesn't change.
The result isn't that blockchain gets in a bind... Instead the price goes up to at least partially make up for the reward magnitude.
I think we should all continue to keep an eye on hashrate during the process, but generally it only  goes down in the short term, and never enough to worry about security.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:49:05


In what way? Consensus is a majority opinion. Even if there is a new rule set, it doesn't mean that mined proof of work of the previous parts of the chain disappears.


I mean, again... I've seen this talking point, but I haven't seen any concrete evidence of things becoming unstable.
Even BCH's 8MB proposal was a minority fork so of course BTC kept rolling on.
I think that if the Segwit 2x chain would have activated it would have been a different story, but it's hard to say in retrospect.
Nothing really became "unstable" at any point through all of that and it was probably the most contentious fork in crypto history.

[And the average blocksize with current segwit usage is around 1.2MB]( Considering segwit also isn't 100% efficient in scaling data, the actual increase in block capacity has been pretty small in general.

That's strange. A 20MB connection should easily be able to handle the network chatter from blocks several times the size.
Have you checked a non-ookla, non-branded speedtest?
Your IP may be covertly throttling your data.
It also may be a memory issue. I'd check that too.

Next block during the day tends to go above 40 sat. I don't think it's insane, but it's uncomfortable. The other issue is if anything above the norm happens on chain, they can go far higher.


That's an interesting attack. I won't say it can't happen, but because the miner themself also has to maintain the chain, it's a detriment to them as well as everyone else.
As far as block size filling, there are plenty of other alts where this is possible, but I haven't yet seen it happen in the wild.
As far as things not being on-chain forever, I do agree and hope that UTXO checkpoints are considered at some point in the future.
It would be far more efficient for node startup and you wouldn't have any overhead from people abusing the chain.

Incorrect - the Patent Office is completely self-funded via patent fees. It's one of only two government organizations that receive no external funding and routinely give it to other government organizations...
The other is the IRS of course.

I mean, I suppose that's one way to look at it.
I think it's more like a typical software updater that may not have full legacy support.
If you have a piece of software that you need to update that will invalidate older clients, You have to put some legwork in to making sure everyone knows - but that's what matters most... the advance announcement of the change.
Only if something goes truly wrong is the reliability criteria hurt... like the recent problems with Microsoft Windows updates.

I first heard about it on the now defunct tech podcast "Buzz Out Loud" in mid 2010. After hearing about it, I actually set up a wallet but I never fully understood how to start mining or anything like that so I don't *think* I ever ran anything.
Although... there's a non-zero chance I'm responsible for one of those bitcoin wallets that have 50 - 200 coins in them and are now completely idle.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:52:33
I'm guessing they've already had a few.

As a patent examiner, I can't say this isn't too far off the mark, although it's more a symptom of having a low error rate on millions of applications...
If patent examiners are right 99% of the time, with almost 1,000,000 applications filed every year, that still means that 10,000 bad patents will be issued.

I'm not sure if you're trolling or if you don't know enough about Bitcoin to make a fair assessment, but because the currency is in it's infancy, I hate how many of these posts get snapped off with downvotes and short, snarky remarks in this sub. For that reason, I'm taking this comment sincerely.
Based on the protocol, the number of Bitcoin cannot extend above 21 million.
That means the entire currency is absolutely finite... something no other currency has going for it.
To say the "ideal" value of Bitcoin should be $1 would be like saying the "ideal" value for a Japanese yen is 1¢ or the "ideal" value for an ounce of gold is $1. It sounds good at first, but the entire value of a currency is based (more or less) off of its usefulness and how widespread it is as a store of value. The Japanese Yen, for example, is actually currently valued very close to 1¢ each, but was valued around 30% higher as late as the beginning of this year. We can't hold any "ideal" because economic shifts occur. The most recent was a shift in the storage of money from JPY to USD in that particular stage of the global economic recovery.
A more apt comparison is to gold, as there is likely a finite limit to the amount on Earth (barring some strange space-exploration or meteor-strike scenarios.) You can't declare that gold suddenly be worth $1 / ounce as it's usefulness as a currency alone would far outstrip that price. Every ounce of gold would be sold out in seconds.
Because Bitcoin has an absolute ceiling to the number of coins that can be created, it will never suffer from inflation like any government-controlled currency, and it's price will be determined on the open market. Because it is potentially a global currency, there is likely to be quite a bit of demand and there is good reason to believe this is only the beginning for Bitcoin. It's growing quickly right now because it has not yet reached an economic equilibrium.
I'd also like to point out that while Gold has recently acquired quite a few uses, until around 1950, it was used nearly exclusively as a store of value - either in jewelry, coins or bars. Even with over 171,000 tonnes of gold mined in the world, the fair market price per ounce was around $1200 USD today meaning that gold, as a store of wealth, holds $7.4 trillion dollars USD of global wealth.
For comparison, Bitcoin is one of the only other viable global currencies and the total value of Bitcoins has only just passed the $10 billion mark. Don't get me wrong - gold to Bitcoin has some apples-to-oranges qualities, but Gold is one of the most comparable commodities-as-currency because inflation has a finite cap and both are considered valid forms of payment in limited locations globally.
When you view Bitcoin right now, you should think about gold it it's infancy. When it was first discovered, it was nothing more than a shiny rock. As time went on, more and more uses were found and it became more and more widespread until the demand meant it was selling for more than $1/ounce and it would likely never return to that price.
I do see potential downsides to Bitcoin, and investing is not without risk, but there is very good reason that Bitcoin cannot suddenly be declared to be $1 each.

In fairness, one of the main reasons this happened is because all of the financial institutions of China that were invested in Bitcoin had to dump their holdings. I'm not sure how close that parade is to being over, but swings get even worse when a government tells people who were speculating that they can't anymore.

At this point - no.
The best way would be to buy bitcoins on Gox, xfer to a different exchange (like CBX or BitStamp,) sell them there and withdraw the funds.
Unfortunately the price at Gox is $10 / BC higher than almost any other place. Because people are vaguely unsure about the future of Gox, this essentially becomes the premium to ensure you get your payout.
As far as I understand it, your two options are to wait for Gox to implement a different payout system or to xfer via Bitcoin.

You don't have to buy Bitcoin in whole units... If you can afford .7 BTC, I strongly recommend buying .7 BTC despite the fact you could have gotten a better deal on the first Bitcoin you purchased.
