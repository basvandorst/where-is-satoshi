What more can you expect from a site that autoplays videos with sound?

Zero confirmations? You sure? What's stopping someone from just faking the transaction?

lol let's be real here. Many people buy XBT just for the growth.

Some guy's Bitcoin balance and dollar value. He's spending BTC (look at it from bottom up). He's losing bitcoin but the value is going up.

Thiefs buy Amazon gift cards using stolen credit cards, then sell those cards on Local Bitcoin getting untraceable bitcoins.

Then why use Bitcoin? I'll use PayPal or Venmo instead to send money to friends. If I want to buy something, I'll use my debit card. Both have little to no fees, unlike the ridiculous fees and wait time of Bitcoin.

Damn really? Mine only came with 0.5BTC. I should get a refund.

Of course. 
Try looking around for a different wallpaper that actually gives you coins.

You guys want to use Bitcoin as a currency, but find it weird if we want to buy our coffee with it? How will it take off then?

Quick, someone xpost this to @_date: 2017-06-30 01:30:31
Try using a local exchange instead. The fees might be higher but you don't really have much choice.
