Peter Schiff doesn't have much credibility.  He thinks there shouldn't be a minimum wage and that people would be happy to work for $2/hr.  He also predicted that the U.S. dollar would be worthless by now and that gold would skyrocket to $5000.  
He's just another loud mouth, know nothing fool.

You, on the other hand, are simply illiterate.

The rationale should be obvious.  The sudden rise in value is abnormal, even for an unstable crypto currency like BitCoin.  It's also happened in the past.  It rises steadily for several months with the biggest spike happening at the end and then it starts to plummet.
I've also noticed more and more signs of possible large scale money laundering by monitoring transactions on Blockchain.  Essentially, what I'm saying is that the meteoric rise in value has very little to do with increased mainstream acceptance, the situation in Cyprus (a tiny country) or Spain.  Frankly, I'm surprised that these ridiculous reasons are being eaten up here at Reddit.  
If Gold and Silver can be manipulated, organizations can do the same with BitCoin and with a lot less resources.

It's not illegal to discuss issues related to SilkRoad.  If they tried to go after the mods of that subreddit then they'd also go after every Website that has written an article about SilkRoad and allowed people to post comments in response to their story.

What a silly article.  Why would any country adopt a crypto currency whose value fluctuates wildly?

The falling price of BitCoin has nothing to do with Cyprus.  Their government severely limited bank accounts on Monday and the price of BitCoin continued to rise until yesterday, a full 5 days after bank accounts were limited.  
Cyprus is a very small country and the current situation there has nothing to do with the wild fluctuation of BitCoin's value.

Nothing lasts forever.  Eventually, people will want a new product that's perceived to be better than coke and sooner or later a new crypto-currency will dethrone BitCoin.

How does your conspiracy theory explain this?

Cowards.  There was a lot of good information being posted regarding the raid and there was no good reason to shut down that subreddit.

I don't think it has anything to do with Coinlab. Coinlab is irrelevant and inconsequential when you look at the big picture.

Some people, including myself, believe that markets can and frequently are manipulated.  Gold, silver, oil and natural gas prices have all been manipulated, in my opinion.  
If you have the resources to manipulate BitCoin then a quick way to make money is to use your resources to buy as many coins as you can, thereby creating a false sense of value that will entice others to buy these coins at overvalued prices, which will drive the price up even further.  After a while, you dump all of your coins for a big profit.  
Maybe it's not happening here but that's the theory.

It'll hover around $30 within 10 days.

I'm buying if it goes down to $25USD.

I disagree.  BitCoin is a crypto currency and although it's currently dominating in this field, there are a lot of competitors.  
If one or more of these other crypto currencies gains mainstream acceptance then the value of BitCoin will probably decrease.  Therefore, just like stocks, the value of BitCoin is partly dependent on how it performs in comparison to its competitors.

I may be wrong.  I'm not so sure that a drop in price hurts money launderers because I think they get rid of their "laundered" coins by converting it to cash quickly.  I didn't expect the price to reach $140+ so I stand corrected but I still think it will crash soon.

Xenu is out there somewhere but what does He have to do with BitCoin? ;)
