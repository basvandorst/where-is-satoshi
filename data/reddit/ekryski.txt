�� agree. The only way for crypto to reach any sustainable nature is to actually use it as intended - digital cash.

Not worried. Simply found it interesting because Simon explains a lot more about the ecosystem as a whole than all the articles that have just been screaming FUD. Thought others might find it interesting as well. ��

Yeah I get that, but it doesn't help to bury your head in the sand. I wouldn't share if I didn't think it was worth the watch.
What struck me most was the discussion about Japan and South Korea actually.

Ya they should be able to. Or you can transfer to another exchange, wallet, etc. where you can continue to hold or trade them, but unless you have another bank account somewhere or have a way of funneling cash back to your chinese bank account you won't be able to convert it to usable currency until the Chinese make trading CNY to crypto legal (if that happens).

This isn't to spread FUD at all. The cover image is actually pretty misleading.
This interview packs a punch! Covers recent events in China, how regulation is impacting China and the flow of crypto currency around the globe, and how exchanges are likely to react to regulation pushed down from governments. Even has an earthquake caught on camera. Grab some ��

Related to some of the discussion in the interview. Japan is now the largest Bitcoin market.
