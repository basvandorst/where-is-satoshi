Wow!! Fantastic article! Thanks!

Well I think that in Bitfinex's case a $15 Ledger HW.1 would have prevented the whole mess.

Absolutely!! Please be sure that while you're being raped you talk to the rapist very politely!

May I suggest Shriner-Burns Children's Hospital for children with birth defects and cancer? Also Texas Children's Hospital is a worthy endeavour.

CloudBleed perhaps? They were one of the sites mentioned.

I think he's referring to the bitcore software behind the Copay wallet client. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 08:56:21
I just tried it with the Android client and it's still using the old-style addresses. Does the Android client need upgrading for the bc1 addressing to work?

I did 2 purchases recently (within the past week) on Coinbase. One with a CC and another through ACH. In the CC instance I was charged a international fee. 
Is this going to be the norm from now on?

BTC_Forever has always taken great pride in demonstrating that he is the "poster child" for immature, obnoxious, rude behavior. On top of that he's generally wrong and misinformed on everything he says.
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:51:23
Yah know... I generally disagree with everything says bit in this one case I have to agree with him/her!

Does anyone have any thoughts about Uphold? Seems that they offer several different crypto-currencies as well as metals. But there doesn't seem to be much information about them on the Internet.

I asked support to cancel my account the day of the announcement. It was cancelled within a few hours. I bet they are overwhelmed with cancellation requests an they are processing them in a FIFO manner.

I tried buying a small amount of BTC through Glidera. My hair turned grey before it finally showed up.
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:29:21
Well I just checked... Glidera is still an option for purchasing BTC with fiat. But there is no instant purchase. The one time I tried them I seem to remember that it took over a week for the transaction to complete.
I have reasons NOT to go back to Coinbase. Primarily, their CS is the worst in the world.

Mycelium! It will also work in conjunction with a hardware wallet.

He's hiding behind his mommy's keyboard.
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:04:16
You should be made aware that acts and consistently spams all the subs like a child playing on his mommy's computer without her permission. If you look at his posting history you will quickly see that this poster has **NEVER** posted anything with any value. He's nothing more than a troll. *Don't feed the troll!*
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:54:09
You said it bro! I just sent Circle a request to cancel my account immediately. Keep in mind they still maintain ALL the banking/debit card info you gave them when signing up. Now there's a entity out on the Internet that holds your banking info and cannot/will not give you any benefit.
@_date: 2016-12-13 20:12:00


Instant? It takes 4-5 days to get BTC thru Glidera. Where do you get this *instant* part? I just did a transaction with Glidera and it took 5 days.
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:03:32
When you do a spend transaction Ledger will ask you to verify the transaction by solving a "puzzle" using the security card. It's a form of 2FA.
 
 explains the entire process.

LocalBitcoins isn't an option. I live out in the sticks and the closest LocalBitcoin person is 160 km away. Plus I have no intention of meeting up with a stranger while holding a wad of cash.
@_date: 2016-12-07 08:09:42
Are you kidding me? You might as well ask "Is it alright to let a stranger hold my wallet?"
I'm betting Circle will retain all your personal banking information even after account closure.

Name one! (And Coinbase doesn't count)

I use a Ledger HW.1 myself. Actually I have 3 of them all keyed to the same wallet. I have one that I carry with me, one that I keep in a lock box at home and the 3rd is in a safety deposit box at the bank. Total expenditure? About $45 USD.
@_date: 2015-08-19 07:07:49
Wow!! I wish you luck! I know what it's like to have funds tied up.

Because of my spooky compulsion yesterday that told me to buy I've made over 600 dollars in the past 24 hours! I sure would like to know what ghost was whispering in my ear yesterday!

Will do! In fact I'll tell everyone! LOL ��
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:47:57
LOL! Usually when I buy I cause everything to crash!
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:45:46
Wow! Intuition made me buy a bunch of BTC just hours before this bull run. I was bored and just decided to do a buy.
@_date: 2016-09-02 10:18:58
Actually Circle allows you to add a bank account and a debit card. Just look under settings.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:20:51
It works but it's a "shower thought". Seriously don't do this. I have no idea what the half-life is on lemon juice.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:48:26
LOL!! Now that's  funny!
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:22:26
The Ledger Nano S does indeed have a device display.
@_date: 2015-09-15 11:07:56
I'm giving it a shot right now. It looks good so far.
@_date: 2015-09-12 10:49:02
Or if you don't care that it's not as "pretty" as then Nano you can get the HW.1 from Ledger for about $15 US. It's the exact same firmware with different packaging.

I'm on Android 4.3 using the BitPay version I downloaded from the Google Play store earlier this morning.

The why don't you remove our original post warning people NOT to use Electrum?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:00:37
Wonderful! Let's go to Fidelity's cafeteria and buy a hamburger. If you pay cash it's $2.39. Pay in BTC with the transaction fee and all it will cost is a measly $8.78 for that $2 burger! LOL!
@_date: 2016-10-25 08:35:56
I don't think it's ready for prime time yet. I downloaded the new wallet and when I get to the point where I integrate my BitPay Visa card it takes me to my BitPay Visa dashboard and there is nothing there that allows me to attach the new wallet to the card or vice-versa
@_date: 2015-10-29 09:58:36
This is the same error I always get. I even tried to go down the rabbit hole that is causing this error and tried to get all the necessary files and dependencies satisfied. After several attempts I finally gave up and switched to Copay. It supports the Ledger and works very well.
~~I doubt Electrum will ever support hardware wallets under Windows.~~
~~Commercial Break: Now it's time for everyone to jump in and flippantly say "Just run Unix" as if it's as easy as changing your socks.~~
EDIT: Everything works now! I'm an Electrum convert!
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:18:27
You and Jim get "funded" every time someone sends BTC from a MultiBit HD wallet. Did you forget to mention that MultiBit HD adds a "donation fee" to all send transactions? This is in addition to the mining fee.
@_date: 2017-05-01 00:31:39
If you're running Windows you may want to check to see if the Ledger is a "unrecognized device". If so, delete it from the device list, plug the Ledger back in and let it be "re-discovered". I've had to do that a couple of times myself.
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:40:53
Why don't you just tell us about it here instead of making us watch a video?

I got an email day before yesterday informing me that mine is on the way! Thank you Coin Center!
@_date: 2015-10-11 22:08:38
I have 2 Ledger HW1's. I use one as a 1of1 signatory on a multi-sig wallet with Coinkite. I use the 2nd HW1 with the Ledger Wallet Chrome app. The Chrome app isn't tied to any given service like the first one that's tied to Coinkite.
@_date: 2015-10-10 12:12:22
I read about that too. But so far I haven't seen any credible evidence that any of the accusations are true. If/when *ANY* credible documentation is presented then I will re-evaluate my opinion.
@_date: 2015-10-08 09:10:24
I use Coinkite in conjunction with my Ledger. The perfect combination! Coinkite has a lot of features and I have the security of my Ledger because I set up a 1of1 multi-sig wallet with my Ledger as the signatory.
@_date: 2015-10-10 13:12:53
What makes you say this? Do you have any proof? I mean *verifiable* proof? Not just hearsay but some documentation I can actually see?
The reason I ask is that so far all I see is Cryptsy bashing. I've been using them for years without any issues.
@_date: 2015-10-17 18:31:19
Roger that Murzika! Thanks! Another question... Can the Windows executable be used as a co-signer without the HW.1?
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:46:33
yes you can use the 24-word seed with many different wallets that support BIP32
@_date: 2015-10-21 07:16:07
Any idea as to when the Chrome app version will be updated? The Chrome store still shows 1.2.5

If you go to a .onion address there is no "exit node". It all stays withing the TOR network. Exit nodes are used when the requesting URL needs to exit to the "clear net".
@_date: 2015-10-21 18:06:22
It's there now. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-08 09:24:02
I've moved all of my funds to the Ledger wallet. It's the most cost-effective way of protecting your BTC. I have one that I use with Coinkite and one that I use as a standard Ledger wallet for extra security. I also have a third HW1 to use as a backup in case I lose one of the first two :)
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:21:29
I see some posts here that have a semblance of credibility and some that are just pure FUD. Rather than take advice from strangers why don't you do a little research? 
Here' a start for you: 
And folks... the "what if" scenarios can cover just about anything. "What if the sun goes nova while I'm scanning my private key?" "What if my cat sticks a fork in an electrical outlet when I plug in my HW wallet?" The question about Hardware wallets vs Paper Wallets is good topic and a good question. I'd like to see some informative answers rather than just speculation and uninformed opinions.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:28:31
Just keep track of the 24 words. Write them down. Secure them. Don't lose them.
@_date: 2016-10-15 15:44:21
Apparently wealthy does not equal smart. With all that money he should have purchased a $15 Ledger HW.1. He would still have ALL his money with such a minor purchase.
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:08:03
I tried it with all versions. Always get the same results.
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:11:50
Then why do most of us constantly get the error mentioned above? You are completely ignoring the fact that many of us get an error that forces us to add a bunch of libraries and dependencies that just doesn't make it worth the hassle. Yes I know it says on the website that Electrum supports the HW.1. But actual real-life experience demonstrates otherwise. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 08:34:55
Ditto! I just started using Copay and it's the best wallet I've ever seen! 
@_date: 2015-10-23 18:40:05
Thanks! And thank you for a great wallet! I love it!
@_date: 2015-10-30 06:11:50
Yay btchip! I downloaded the version of Electrum that you sent me and I'm happy to report that Electrum works with the Ledger! This is really good news and thank you!

Once a Coinbase account goes into "review" you might as well send another message asking "Can I get a kiss? I like to be kissed while I'm getting screwed!"
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:52:24
Well I have never done anything illegal with my BTC. But... I have a history of buying BTC thru Coinbase using a credit/debit card and immediately transferring it to my Ledger hardware wallet. I just noticed that Coinbase has lowered my purchasing ceiling from $2000/day to $40/day. I guess they don't trust hardware wallets either. I just do these purchases when I get a paycheck. The funds are HODL and never go anywhere else.
@_date: 2016-07-29 09:32:09
same here.
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:34:36
I'm using Electrum in conjunction with a Ledger HW.1. The combo provides the security of a hardware wallet with ease-of-use.
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:59:50
Umm... I'm the prick? LOL! I'm just trying to get you to post factual information about your claim that you're going to come steal my Ledger and break into it and steal my private key. So far I haven't seen any info from your end. Did I miss something? Was I supposed to give you a URL to Google Maps or something?
The only issue I see here is that so far all of your claims are completely unsubstantiated where I have been asking you to prove ANYTHING you have posted.
If you don't want us "pricks" challenging you then maybe you shouldn't post in the first place.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:46:11
You're the "expert" here! You tell me! I'm a HODL'er. I have a list of addreses associated with my Nano to send funds to a receive address.
And to more accurately answer your question... No my cell phone works just fine too for the transactions I perform.
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:08:57
Do your own homework! Why take the advice of strangers on Reddit when you can go to the manufacturer's website and read up on it yourself.  Then you can draw your own conclusions rather than relying on the advice of strangers.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:23:30
Yah... good luck with all your claims. Come steal my Ledger, then apply your "technical expertise" to get the private key. Anything you find on my Ledger you are welcome to it.
BTW when the police are arresting you at my bank for breaking into my box please be sure to show them this post giving my permission to hack my Ledger. I'm sure they will be impressed.
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:30:53
Do you have any proof of these "bugs"?
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:14:29
I'm in the same boat. I applied a week and a half ago and I haven't heard a peep.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:24:43
But once you do a spend from a paper wallet it is no longer "private". It's a single address solution. A hardware wallet provides a new receive address every time you use it.
