This sounds cheesy, but I connect with it. I grew up watching my family lose their house due to the familiarity-built trust of refinance commercials. I view bitcoin, and the movement, as the only light at the end of a tunnel. If the separation of currency and state is not the answer, I’d love to see a better solution.

I agree that the solution is to make sure that you understand decisions that you make within a system, but I’m willing to expand and point out that systems change over time and programmable money is not an escape, but a natural and innovative progression.

Do we want etf’s? Serious question that I have been looking into and learning about. I don’t understand the benefit of letting speculation outside of having actual skin in the game? If the goal is adoption, then why not release a decentralized betting platform that uses the actual coins?

I want a demographic list of those that would have that much cash on hand.

I realized that I was commenting from the assumption the closed atms that you mentioned would not be opening again. I agree that I would trust cash more than bank balances during a short term emergency, but I was trying to dive into observing spending patterns of cash to reduce organized crime. Or even the impact that an emergency would have on the value of a dollar, considering the online alternatives to currency.
