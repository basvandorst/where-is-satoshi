Some months ago my node crashed. In the process of recovering the backup I think I published an old state and I lost all my funds in one channel (2M sats). Can this help me to recover my sats?

Why not use bitcoin block as a ramdom number generator?
@_date: 2019-11-02 11:29:54
\+1  for Breez.  Very simple UI, they open a channel to you , so you can receive sats from the first minute.
@_date: 2019-03-03 13:19:34
Pad Thai, mmmmm
@_date: 2019-03-06 13:51:33
Not a great business having in mind that you broadcasted and old state in a channel with my node and I have published a penalty transaction getting all the funds.
Exactly 2MM sat = 63 $.
@_date: 2019-11-30 13:51:39
Trying your app right now !!
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:51:04
You mean the last bitcoin?  The last block will take 10 min, the same to all others.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:16:54
Try Breez,  even an idiot can use it,
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:21:35
I'm not an expert, but I think he has to send before he can receive. Maybe this is your sending capacity?. Or you opened a channel to him?
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:29:30
Custodial wallets are very easy. In Bluewallet you have to put funds in a normal bitcoin address and you can send and receive through LN.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:40:46
Old blocks have less transactions than recent blocks, Pi verify older blocks faster.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:05:01
You can send me 1 sat to test
sorry ,10 sat better, maybe not enough for fees

I have Zap desktop installed and connected to my own node on mainnet.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:15:34
I think he hasn't inbound capacity, He has to send some sats first
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:20:31
I think zap wallet is connected to his own node.  I use the desktop version, waiting for android release.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:33:32
ok, then he has to post an invoice.

Breez works fine too, very simple and non custodial

I am unable to scan the lndconnect QR code with my smartphone. I had to copy the text on laptop and send an email to my mobile and them paste on Zap Android.

All your public (addresses) and private keys are derived from your seed words. You only need to keep your seed.
@_date: 2019-12-08 18:42:23
Try again
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:50:25
It's a custodial wallet, you don't have to run a node, Bluewallet manages channels.
Of course there has to be funds and a route available to destination.

Actually ECB is buying bonds from goverments and big companys at 0% rate.  This money avoid that many countries and companies go bankrupt. So ECB is paying public and private salaries and retirement pensions.

LN is awesome.  This means you can pay with 1 click on every web that works with webLN  specification.
No copy-paste, no scan, no invoice, just one click.

If you have a raspbery pi 3 i'd turn off the wifi and connect only by ethernet.
I have a similar issue. On starting I got  15-10 connections and then decreased to only 8.
I saw my pi on my router connected twice  wifi/ ethernet.  Once I tuned off wifi all worked fine.
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:00:03
I don't think it is a ISP problem. Try to connect to another ISP, for example with your mobile phone internet.
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:08:40
Sorry, but I don't know how to read code. 
I mean, It'd be fine to make a sheet to do the ckecksum calculation by hand in an easy way. 
I don't know if it is possible.
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:40:33
You can release the checksum calculation code, maybe some people want to do it totally offline.
When I  bought my HW wallet i didn't trust "pre-charged" seeds. I tried to write my own seed, but only got an error message. I didn't know last was a chekcsum word.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:59:33
Is there a way to know which is the oldest btc that has been moved?
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:47:17
I use keepass for my passwords, you can attach QR codes too.
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:21:21
I like it. 
\- Very easy to join. It takes 10 seconds if you have twiter account. I´d add google, facebook or email account.
\- I see potential on social networks. People kill for likes imagine if it is money involved.
\- I´d add information of the sending tip part. How to get LN BTC, recomended wallet...
\- Same for cashout. You can asociate with a LN exchange.
Let's try:  [

Very useful thanks. I use to store my seed with numbers. 
Now I have 20 pages, this makes it easier.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:47:19
Worked this way ¡¡ Thanks
lncli payinvoice lnbc1pwqt....  --amt  1400
I haven't more sats on this channel :) . I have sent you some more from other channel and worked fine, I don't know why cashout didn't find a route before.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:45:26
Is better to backup QR activation codes as a picture, so you can scan again in other phones.
I use keepass to do the backup

I have a Ln Node with some channels funded whith less than 10 $ capacity.  What would happen if onchain fees rise above 10$?
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:58:32
As long as the  two phones are synced It works fine.
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:57:08
I have a LN node connected with Zap desktop wallet. In Zap I can't insert a sat amount when you want to pay a zero sat invoice.  I pay this kind of invoices from LN node console:
lncli payinvoice lnbc1....... --amt 1000
I don't know what is the problem. If the node can do it, the wallet should also be able to.

Tip sent :) . I have also put it in some forums

a 10.000 $/year "security" service for cripto assets?
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:15:44
Install Electrum now an test if you can access to your btc using your seed.
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:33:26
I think It was online, maybe a network issue. To be sure I have restarted the node now, you can try.

I received some sat so I want to test a cashout to my wallet and send back to you. 
Yes, I am getting a "can't find path" message. I am doing it from my node shell so 
I'm not totaly sure if i was doing correctly, I am new with LN. I 'll try again later after work. 
This is my node 033c87f6e5e202a4569d6d074da09cad4210a25bb89f00d6f53caa7429f6e55eed

I wanted to make a donation of 1 $. When you aks a LN invoice for 1$ you get a 2$ invoice. Maybe a bug, I am using Opera browser.
I finally made 2$ donation.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:46:06
can you connect to your own LN node?
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:31:40
Yes , the email was in spam inbox
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:57:54
Cash out worked fine ¡¡  Now fighting to send back the sats to you, I have problems making the "payinvoice" but I think it's my fault .
I get this message  \[lncli\] rpc error: code = Unknown desc = invalid bech32 string length 4
I am triyng this comand:  lncli payinvoice 1400 lnbc1pwqt................
