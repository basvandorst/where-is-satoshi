NEED ADVICE PLEASE. I have Coinbase account, trying to Xfer money to electrum. It seems I found out about fork a bit too close for comfort. do I have time to send or receive before split of btc ? also I haven't had time to send small amount to my New Electrum account to see if its safe or not. so im scared to send all my investment to an unknown. is there a way to quick test a new wallet?
