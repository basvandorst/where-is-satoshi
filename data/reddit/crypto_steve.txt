I can understand why you wouldn't want fractional reserve banking to arrive in the bitcoin space...   It could massively increase the money supply.   However, it is going to happen.   There is nothing to stop it.

As most of us know, we are all standing on the shoulders of giants.   It is interesting to see how basically each of the individual pieces where already in place, it was just a matter of assembling them in the correct manner.
I think a lot of this falls under the idea of simultaneous invention / multiple discovery (
We have all heard the stories about the invention of the telephone.
As I have said to many people:  "If you think you have a unique idea, just search the internet."

Whether there is any "intrinsic reason" for Bitcoin to increase in value can be debated, however Bitcoin will increase in value as long as the demand increases faster than Bitcoins are mined which is very likely.

Great video!   I really agree with the part about the current opportunities for wealth creation.   When you think about it, this is the first time in history with such open access to financial markets without being in a position of power.

You realize that almost all electricity put into a computer is returned as heat, right?  Aside from a very small amount that is turned into sound or light energy.
So traditional resistance heat is 100% efficient and heat via microprocessor might be 99.9999% efficient.

It's a simple question of conservation of energy.   All of the electrical energy you put into a system is converted into some other form of energy.   What other forms of energy does does a micro processor output besides heat?  I suppose a negligible amount of energy is emitted at RF noise.

That's a rather cynical view...   this post isn't about begging for bitcoin, it is about thanking a company for their great service.  What better way to do that than to try to provide them with some referrals?

It seems in one breath it is being said that the individual miners have little to no influence over the system...   Yet in the next breath it is being said that mining is centralizing and there are very few remaining miners.    Which is it?
Either way, I think your right.   It would only take one or two of the larger mining pools to increase their minimum fee to cause people wanting faster confirmations to pay higher fees.   And after all, what is wrong with that?   When I'm sending a p2p payment I'll pay a little more for it to confirm quickly.   When I'm moving bits into cold storage, I'll pay the lower fee because it doesn't matter if it takes hours to get into cold storage.

It's called standard of living.  It also wasn't common for a family to have two cars, a 2500 sq ft house, take a tropical vacation every year, etc...

What makes you think he was "busted so thoroughly"?   This might just be what they managed to find.   He could have many more BTC that no-one else knows about.

It'd be hard to prove that it wasn't too.  ;)

I think you may want to consider a crash course on mining.  The size of the block has nothing to do with how fast a solution is found.  The only thing it changes is how fast the block propagates to other miners.

I think one of the key concepts that is missing from this discussion is incremental cost.   In both the traditional banking system and the Bitcoin system, the incremental cost of a single transaction is almost nothing.
All of this so called waste that is being discussed is based on taking the cost of mining and dividing by the number of transactions.   I would like to believe that as the number of transactions increases, this calculation will look much more favorable.
