Honestly I hope Blockchain.info's Problems get fixed but To be frank with you Being unable to move my money around right now because of this is frustrating but I have faith in the company. I don't support Vindictive action against blockchain because "fuck blockchain.info." I  make an Effort to support the Idea of  Decentralization because I support Decentralization as a matter of philosophical first principle.
AKA: It's not personal.

Potentially but the latest action seems to merely be Profit taking and a correction.

I never thought i'd find myself agreeing with  Libertarians about economics or feel any sense of solidarity with them but I totally do right now.  because OH GOD, We have to protect the PAYDAY LENDERS from any competition!  Seriously  my interest rates on BTCJam were noting copared to the payday lenders, I could  have helped someone get out of a jam (irony! btcjam!) that way by consolidating payday loans  so that they got a better interest rate.

IDK. I just know that I support decentralization.

There's a **huge** difference in my mind between *wanting* to increase mining centralization and *accepting* that minining centralization is inevitable. Personally I've accepted either way we go the thrust isi n the direction of centralized mining. I don't *like* it at all and *wish*  it wasn't like that but I believe it's **inevitable.**

I supported network neutrality under Title II pretty relentlessly, why would I see paid prioriziation in Bitcoin any differtly?

You can't do anything with gold but store it?
People don't trade with it. You generally don't go and offer Silver or gold to buy things in the Current world we live in.
It sits in Storage bins and Collects dust and doesn't really accumilate interest in any capacity, neanwihle in bitcoin you have btcjam and various ways to accrue interest in it with it and in other cryptocurrencies on top of that.
I've done gold and silver for awhile, I got in post 2011 and missed the train and I have to tell you Buffet is right. I  don't think he'd adopt bitcoin himself as he'd see it as -too- risky.
Oh and one more thing, I don't actually support the whole "Inflation is Satan" Arguments being put forward by the theorist.
My desire is that Bitcoin  exist side by side With fiat currency and that's what I want. Unlike many in the bitcoin space I understand Conventional Economics enough to understand why deflation is a bad thing but the Bitcoin Economy is not the same thing as the Fiat economy. Two, entirely different things.
utterly distinct in my mind and in particular that status quo is one I want to maintain. I don't want to Eliminate Fiat Currencies, I want to coexist with them.
Deflation  is Bad news in The Fiat Sector:
The Cryptocurrencies can exist along with them. Remember the Competing Currencies idea? Yeah...
To note I used to argue vigorously against Competing currencies but bitcoin completely changed my mind.
But I'm not a Austarian economist so my  use is not motivated by an ancap ideology. if anything I tend to be more of a Left libertarian.

seriously i've been waiting for answers there as well. They cite "it raises security issues" but apparentally can't be assed to explain what those security issues are precisely and in a nuanced and specific matter. Vague answers are unhelpful.

Yeah the medium of exchange components are equally important to the store of value components over here. What good is bitcoin if I'm just storing it on a USB "vault." and not moving it around for various operations to chase returns? I have to be able to use it for more than just storing value and sometimes that means taking risks I wouldn't otherwise but it's the only way.

for fuck sake we're supposed to be Decentralized why are so many people still using Blockchain?  Talk about spontaneous centralization arising from chaos. FIGHT, RESIST. YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG BITCOIN COMMUNITY.

I believe it's going to stick primarily because it's the best explanation for Bitcoin that we're likely ever going to get.  Short, Simple and straight to the point.

Which is arguably relevant to bitcoin because some of the market is buying coins because of fears of Devaluation of the dollar.
