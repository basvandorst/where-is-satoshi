Did you actually read your link? The part where they talk about UK investigations that revealed satanic rituals? The only caveat is that the sex abuse tend to occur outside the rituals.
And let's stop ignoring the mountain of evidence for global coverups in Belgium, UK, and the US. It's only the most pedantic people who refuse to connect obvious dots that try to argue the connections away. Once the "conspiracies" become public, and authority figures tell you they're real, then people who denied the conspiracy will say shit like "well we knew all along, the evidence was all there, this is just a public announcement of something we knew was going all along."
Look into the Franklin pedo ring to see just how far the government can go to coverup a pedo ring. Go look at who they're willing to kill and how they're willing to discredit witnesses. Look at all the places the kids were flown to to have sex with powerful men. Look at how the kids who were taken to the white house and given a private midnight tour made it to the Washington Post and was subsequently silenced.
Look at the case of the CIA "finders" child abductions in Washington DC. It's sick shit but it illustrates how investigations by police can be completely shut off by the people in power.
There's countless of cases, the only thing missing is official acknowledgment. Let's hope that as the criminals start dying off from natural causes and can't be held responsible anymore, we can officially start acknowledging these crimes. This way, at the very least, idiots without the mental faculties necessary for rudimentary deductive reasoning will stop denying the obvious. I can't wait to see the UK publicity of pedo rings to hit the US and see all the idiots who'll come out of the woodwork saying "were none of you paying attention to all the evidence over the decades? All the investigations and testimonials? The coverups?"
