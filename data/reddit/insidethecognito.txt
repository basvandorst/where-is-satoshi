If you want to pay me 2.5 BTC, it proves you know how to use it, and thus, I will qualify you as a Bitcoin Professional.
I can email you a 'degree' also.  I will mail you a physical copy for another 0.1 BTC.

Maybe I just graduated University, working and paying my own way through.  Nobody airdropped me any bitcoins...   I had to take what little bit of money I could scrounge, and have been saving this summer for Bitcoins.  
I'm not complaining, I think the MIT idea was a good one, but it seems like all it accomplished was getting some kids into a court battle. (how did that end, btw?)
It just sucks reading about these giveaways to students when I was literally just a student, and now just have my part time job, and still nobody is considering giving me free bitcoins. 
Just expressing my frustration to anybody who cared enough to read.
