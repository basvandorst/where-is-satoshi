Hey, thanks a ton for the encouragement!

Nice flyer! I'm interested in your services. 
Through my [Higher Math Help]( service, I offer professional online math tutoring to students of high school through advanced undergraduate mathematics. 
I work with students one-on-one via a two-way online whiteboard that supports voice and video conversation and allows students to review lessons through private video recordings of each session. 
I hope to be supporting Bitcoin payments through my site any day now (I'm currently trying to fix a bug in the implementation).
Right now, I'm using PayPal, but the fees! Are. Really. High. I'll be offering discounted rates for purchases made with Bitcoin.
As a Bitcoin community and college insider, would you be able to help me market to the intersection of these two groups?
Although you've indicated your services are free, I'd be happy to discuss compensation with you depending on what you can offer.

Thanks for your feedback. These kinds of discussions are useful, I think, because it seems I hear a bit less about consumer adoption than I do about merchant adoption.

Thanks for your thoughts! It's true that the effectiveness of 1-on-1 tutoring is difficult to match. That's one of the reasons I enjoy it so much!
I do plan to make more videos, because I think they can be a great resource, just as a good book can be, and they have some pedagogical advantages over books as well.
It's also nice that my videos are free, and if a student does like the videos but has a question that the videos don't answer, they can set up a one-on-one session with me to clear things up! 
If you have any other thoughts on the matter, I'd love to hear them!

Interesting, and I don't take it personally.  
Since Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology, there are monumental threats and achievements happening almost every day. That doesn't make them less monumental, but I personally find it interesting to know when the little guys are taking notice as well. You know, Wall Street vs. Main Street and all that. 
Besides, the number of votes and comments on this GHash related [post]( are on a different order of magnitude than my post. It doesn't seem that r/bitcoin is in danger of losing perspective here.

OP: how did you find this article? Glad to see people are reading it!
I'm the Higher Math Help owner quoted at the end. Just gave a talk at the CU bitcoin club's pre-hackathon workshop. They're doing a great job!

Hi Big_Man_On_Campus!
Are you interested about hashing in cryptography? You might be interested in this [cryptography course]( from Stanford made available through Coursera. Enrollment starts June 30th, 2014.
Some familiarity with discrete probability is helpful to take the course, but if you don't have that background, I'd be happy to help you with it!  Actually, it looks like a neat course, so I'd work through it with you if you're interested!
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:11:53
Another relevant Coursera course is [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1]( You'll actually implement a hash table as part of the course. If you'd prefer to work through that course, I'd also be happy to work on that with you.

Thanks anddrade! I appreciate you trying out the new service, and don't forget that MIT has a summer session too!

Do you know the average age of your customers? I could easily be wrong, but I have the impression that bed and breakfast goers tend to be older, whereas Bitcoiners tend to be younger. 
I noticed that some comments have called bitcoin adopters' romantic sensibilities into question, but I wonder if the age issue is more relevant. 
I'm curious, because [my business recently started accepting bitcoin]( It's a tutoring service for high-school and college, so the students are younger, although the parents are often the financially responsible party.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:49:21
Hi vatz! Thanks for that. How was it that you found this? I'm curious.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:39:06
Thanks theophysic!
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:18:11
Yeah, a good teacher makes all the difference. Thanks! 
I was just helping a high-school student find some online resources for self-study over the summer, and I realized that none of them were available when I was in high school. I felt like the old guy who had to walk to school barefoot and uphill both ways, haha!
If there's anything I can do for you now, just let me know.

Hi bh3244!
Universities have different numbering systems, but typically courses are numbered at the 100-, 200-, 300-, and 400-levels, or according to some similar scheme. In that scheme, I'd usually consider a course at the 400-level to be a senior-level course. These are almost always proof-based courses.
Conversely, I wouldn't consider all proof-based courses to be university senior-level. Some are less advanced than others. 
If you're interested in working with me on a course that you think I might consider to be university senior-level, just let me know the university and the course number. I'll look it up, and if I think it'll require a sufficient amount of preparation on my part, I'll let you know that you'll pay the university senior-level rate.
Thanks for your interest!

Other way around. BitGo isn't paying him (yet); [he's paying them](

If the MIT giveaway is to indicate how the general population will use bitcoin, then it will be interesting to see how many of the students actually spend their bitcoin, as opposed to holding it. 
Merchants have little to gain if consumer adoption doesn't grow as well.
For example, my online math tutoring service ([Higher Math Help]( recently started accepting bitcoin. I haven't received many bitcoin payments yet (although I did only start accepting it recently). 
Do you have any guess as to whether MIT students would spend their bitcoin on such a service? 
@_date: 2014-06-24 05:29:22
[At least 15 months]( Kutcher's VC firm actually invested in BitPay back in March 4, 2013, and he was out [promoting Bitcoin]( over a year ago.
Edit: added "promoting Bitcoin" link to cnbc article.

I just recieved my first ever bitcoin donation for my free video tutorials! Thanks so much to whoever made the contribution!! It'll go toward the video course on linear algebra that I'll be starting soon.
Now that I've received both a payment for a session and a donation, this technology feels so real! 
Thanks for the support! 
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:39:17
Thanks. I appreciate the support.

Great! 
One of the killer apps of this form of teaching is the recorded session. If you've ever held or attended office hours, I'm guessing you're familiar with the "What did my teacher say again?" phenomenon. Sometimes it all seems to make sense when you're in the office, and then you just can't quite put it together yourself when you get home.
Private access to the recorded tutoring sessions allows students to go back and see it all again, including the whole conversation and the whiteboard notes! It's just such a neat advancement.
