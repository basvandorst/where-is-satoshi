Because no one was really using it, it was like a 2 or 3 percent of transactions that were using bitcoin

What the hell are you complaining about? I use Tradeking and have no problem making profit from swing trading, the fees are also clearly listed on every brokerage and I can deposit money quickly.
I can't believe you're trying to compare a bitcoin trading site to an online brokerage, you're delusional and have no idea what you're doing.

So you're saying people need the government and police to help them with their unregulated currency?

I would recommend KeePass instead

If I met someone in person on LBC and they tried to scam me, I would take a baseball bat to their fucking face.

It is pretty hilarious - especially when bitcoins biggest holders are all greedy scamming scumbags...just like bankers! go figure

Japan does not recognize bitcoins as a legal currency

I'm not sure what you mean? I used to make cash deposits at the bank with Bitinstant and they never asked for personal information?

What he's trying to say is that it doesn't matter if it's "approved" ..3 years ago I had mine approved too and I got my tax refund deposited and then almost 10 months later I was notified by the IRS I was being audited and I ended up owing $4,000.00 because my taxes were messed up.

You're able to change your plea, infact you should almost always plead not guilty.

Good for you, now make a blog so you can stop reporting your daily life on here.

Ahhh your post brought back memories :) I forget that kids nowadays know nothing about how how the internet used to be.

He did and he'll get away with it just like every other huge bitcoin scammer, no one is going to do shit about it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:33:00
Computer savvy enough for bitcoin? So how come everyday all these "computer savvy" people fall for scam after scam AFTER scam? or leave all their bitcoins in places like MTGOX?
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:51:33
I've bought bitcoin with Paypal many times, there's plenty of legit people that use Paypal to buy them with.

God why the fuck is HIS FACE PUSHED IN LIKE THAT!? Get it off my screen! He looks like a big dumb APE.

This is not how the real world works. Law enforcement routinely confiscates money from people arrested on warrants and from routine street deals.

or use Keepass instead or make secure passwords and keep them in a small lockbox...I wouldn't touch Lastpass with a 2500 ft pole especially since Lastpass has likely been compromised before and all it's users were advised to change passwords by the CEO.

This sounds completely normal...I bank with BB&amp;T and they do the same thing, the fraud department will notify me if they see suspicious charges on my account and ask me if I made them (to protect me and them) and if they believe it's really serious then they will put a hold on my debit card until I call them and okay the transactions.
Every bank has some sort of fraud department that does things like this and all it takes is a single phonecall to clear the situation up.
A few months ago one of the online stores I order from was hacked and my debit card information was stolen and someone made lots of purchases...I was able to call up my bank and get ALL of the money back which is great, can you say the same about bitcoin??? There's pros and cons about banks and bitcoin.

You do know that many highly respected lawyers work as public defenders too right? You can see the same lawyers who charge tens of thousands of dollars working as public defenders every day in criminal court.
