Listen, I like bitcoin as much as the next guy but if you cant handle buying something on eBay you really need to take some time to figure things out. 
Unless youre a kid with no credit card. If thats the case then ignore what i said.

Hopefully you told them to stop being cheap and give their agents real email addresses because sales emails from a Gmail account are sketchy.

I think its because a greedy company just purchased the only factory and they raised the price from $18 to $700 or something crazy like that.

So you trade in Bitcoins for Mavros (their made up currency) that magically gains 20%-100% interest each month. My guess is that Mavros are not an acceptable form of payment anywhere, so they are only worth something when you can convert them back to bitcoin and withdrawl. 
In the scam artists mind this is all technically legal. Everyone is making tons of $ except its not in USD or bitcoins, its in Mavros. Which is a currency they made up and can therefor create and assign as much of it as they want to whoever they want - showing double digit gains to whoever is dumb enough to participate. It has no value, though.
