the countries do not really compete. they are all doing their own half-assed thing when it comes to government. if you have a big global democracy you have a higher number of people to come together to fight for the right things in a diplomatic way and potentially more smart (and bad) leaders. and good leaders are rare.
the key is that it should be federalism.

there are different sub-cultures in any state. states do not equal a homogeneous culture. people are pretty much the same stupid everywhere, i guess you do not want to tell me that there are inferior races. values, yep - world government requires people following world federation laws. if a group wants to stone people for nonsense, they will fight for state laws, or get handled by the police, or in case the support is that huge, try to split into a new thing, if it makes sense or not.
anyway, your country would be a state with democratic say in the bigger thing. can not vote against trump today.
getting the world population under sensible laws may be an utopia, but i do not agree that it is bullshit impossible.
instead of seeing a shit government at the top, i see a good government on a bigger scale.
