2013 ~$50 each.  mostly hodling, although i looked through my phone wallet and the value of the transaction that passed through there are ridiculous.  everyone is over 1k some around 60k.  wish i just held on to those.
What did shia Lebouf say?

I recently became a bitcoin multi-millionaire.  Still live in a shithole apartment and drive a 10 year old car though.  Can't bring myself to sell until LN causes price to skyrocket.

Most people don't like their bosses.  He was an especially big dick.  Most of the employees were new immigrants from the Philippines and the Caribbean and he treated them like absolute shit then fired most of them without warning.

1) Obviously i wasn't fired for pitching bitcoin.  He cleaned house, most of the company was let go
2) I don't work anymore, it's called priorities.  When you have money you can piss it away on a lambo.  I prefer the freedom and security that money buys.
3) If you read my other post then you know that I didn't really follow up on bitcoin for another 2 years.  You typically have limited understanding about something when you don't actually care about it.
4) LOL you're going to lecture me for doing drugs?  oh la la, someone's gonna get laid in college.
Also, I said I live in a shitty apartment and drive an old car.  Partly because I spend 6 months a year backpacking.

you know what, I swear it doesn't phase me in the least.  Just been hanging around long enough to not sweat it I guess.

I'll definitely upgrade at some point, but opportunity cost seems to high at the moment.

Ya, I first heard about it in late 2010, which i have a great story about.  will post it later (it's why i made this account through tor)  but i became a true believer when i bought drugs on the silk road.  I realized something that facilitates that has a bright future.

not signing with current wallet obviously.  Can you alter images?  Trezor has a bar chart showing balance.  Thats as far as I care to go.

here's the story, just posted it

Why  would i care about Karma? I made a new throw away account through tor because that's what you do when you admit to having large amounts of BTC on reddit.

it's worth mentioning that he's a dick.
