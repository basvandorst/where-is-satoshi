How do people put up with this? I would buy a motorbike if i had to do this.
@_date: 2016-06-25 09:13:37
I not sure if it would help but maybe it could at least update every hour. I know in this turbulent time that's not often, but its a rough indication without using much battery   
edit: I meant my suggestion might not help. I like the idea you suggested about greyed out and single click. sorry to be unclear

So if trezor has a seed, why the need to get a trezor, why not use electum or similar and write down the seed? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 10:50:10
It very good, I would love to be able to show coinbase prices on there, but it really is great. thanks!
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:11:27
Yes when I get a euro wallet instead of a US dollars wallet and I pay by SEPA to an account in Estonia.  
I have added and removed funds many times and it always worked, and buying and selling bitcoin is instant.  
The Sepa takes about 3 working days on average.
@_date: 2016-06-28 10:22:12
I think this is the safest way. I don't want to write in my will the seed as anyone can read it, and if I die before my daughter is old enough, the funds could be removed without her consent.

I question whether cancer exists in every part of the world in every location. 
Though I want to believe your theory, I suspect that genes also have something to do with it.

Hello,  when is bitbank going to make the android app in english? This version is in Chinese language 
@_date: 2016-06-25 14:03:07
I love it hahaha
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:15:03
The product looks really cool but the website looks a bit dodgy to me with the weird photos and the prices in dollars when the address is in UK. Putting the prices in bitcoin will solve one of those issues.  
Good luck though, nice product!

I bought 10 Bitcoin in September 2015 to lend to small borrowers on a micro lending website. 
Since then, I have lost 3.17 bitcoin to defaulters, and have a few more who are behind payments by a couple of months. 
I spread myself across lots of types of business, some were miners, some day traders, some business builders and some who wanted to improve their home or get a new car. 
Sadly the experience has made me rather sad that so many people defaulted immediately after getting the money.
It has made me lose faith in the goodness of people a little. But at least I got introduced to Bitcoin!

codes are redeemed, please put a trail version out that lasts 1 or 2 days  
edit: I used 94R2K8EG1DYMT3UCM2ZDEXH
@_date: 2016-06-20 07:46:37
can someone eli5 why doing this this would benefit anyone? thanks
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:48:58
The kid in the helmet and the guy in the uniform. It suggests to me that you don't have faith in the product if you need to use wacky photos to promote it. 
The product is cool enough wihout them. 
But it's probably only me, I'm a bit of a  freak when it comes to advertising and marketing. Wait to see what other people say. 
If I want to buy one,  will you ship to Spain? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:43:50
Where does this term come from (bad actors) and what does it mean? thanks
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:14:32
Ok i will bite. As a nooby to mining what would I need and how much would it cost me for said setup? 
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:11:53
Yes but how long did it take him to get verified, I'm at 7 days and counting 
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:04:08
wow , yup does it in mozilla
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:44:20


I am going to use this as an excuse for everything I do :)))
@_date: 2016-06-20 19:24:04
Really you joined reddit to post on this  comment?
Care to tell me what exactly compelled you to sign up and post on a new post with no other votes just to question my story? 
Edit: the word this
@_date: 2016-06-06 16:07:54
It is called bitbond.com
I release in hindsight that some of my investments weren't the best, but I was learning. It is the first time I have ever had enough money to invest in something interesting. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:21:59
I made purchase yesterday and also today, Worked perfectly and fast enough
@_date: 2016-06-19 15:46:30
Wow every country but SPAIN. Why are we not included?
@_date: 2016-06-06 09:37:10
As someone who has done bitcoin lending on microloans , the problem seems to be what to do when people default on payments
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:39:01
I just looked at their mobile site, it isn't that bad
Edit: maybe the desktop version isn't as good? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:52:25
I would love to know more about the life of the miners. What do they feel their life is like? Do they feel it is a good job, something that will give them a future or are they just low paid employees who are being taken advantage of by their employers. 
They don't seem to have a much in the way of value of life, they live in the middle of nowhere, sleep 7 in a room.

I live in Barcelona and use coinbase with euro transfers from my bank account 
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:17:46
gives property developers a bad name, as if we need it
@_date: 2016-10-15 14:13:59
And those people will beat the shit out of anyone with money, whether it is in bitcoin or anything else. So when this time comes, nothing will help you. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 14:43:32
How does this work? What do you do for a job and does your salary change every month to keep up with the current value.
Does your boss mine bitcoin? 
I remember you saying that you pay rent in bitcoin. Where do you live?
@_date: 2016-05-18 08:15:27
Let me know when you have the new app ready, as I would like to use it
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:16:27
Good to talk to you. I really want to invest with you, but the app made me a little uneasy. Do you know why the developers want so much access to my phone?
Add and remove accounts
Take photos and videos 
Precise GPS 
Etc? 
@_date: 2016-10-15 20:36:14
Thanks for the links! 
@_date: 2016-05-09 07:27:48
I searched for it after reading this
@_date: 2016-05-30 15:02:27
Can anyone help me change this sheet to use euros instead of dollars?  I am useless with spreadsheet :(
@_date: 2016-05-18 09:06:43
Will you be making an android app for this? 
@_date: 2016-05-30 20:25:07
Thanks for this

The BBC did a little article on the company, and I thought it looked interesting. I downloaded it from their website. Here is the article 
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:17:27
It's beautifully laughable yet pathetic
@_date: 2016-05-28 17:05:03
Slightly confused by those pictures 
@_date: 2016-07-25 11:29:40
Needed to be said.
@_date: 2016-07-07 09:54:38
Please eli5 why people would suddenly stop buying after the halvening . 
If people in China are using bitcoin to export money, why will the stop buying? 
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:06:58
I don't understand it, but I love it! Mine says I have a fear of fish!! 
Would you care to Eli5 what it is and how I can use it? Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:39:28
This! 
Make bitcoin the backbone to something easy to use and understand for everyone in the community. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 05:03:46
China got flooded,  and huge amount of people displaced. (The reports look terrible, I find floods terrifying) 
@_date: 2016-07-03 11:52:26
Do you know why the person wanted to buy your equipment, did he think it would be worth his while mining? 
Based on this, how can mining pay? 
In USA can you claim capital depreciation on the equipment to reduce your loss? 
@_date: 2016-07-10 21:19:09
This is really clear, thanks!  
So far I have been buying bitcoin on coinbase. Are there places I can buy (or sell) where I can specify the buy order price? Or is invisible to the user on every exchange?
@_date: 2016-07-05 10:06:03
The challenge is on! 
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:36:25
I have an apartment for holiday rentals in Barcelona Spain.  
@_date: 2016-07-03 07:10:44
What happens to their equipment? The guys in China that have thousands of rigs, if they switch them off will they have millions of dollars worth of useless equipment?
What do they do with it? Can they use it for something else like a render farm? 
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:51:47
No. Boo hoo hoo
@_date: 2016-05-09 10:55:35
Hi, are you working at bitbank? From your post it's seems you do
@_date: 2016-07-03 06:53:04
I really wish OpenBazaar could be run from my cell phone, as my home carrier has a very low data limit. I think I need to find a server to host me
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:34:58
Meh Meh?
@_date: 2016-07-11 02:23:23
What would happen to bitcoin's value if everyone who has some started using it, but no one ever cashed it in for Fiat? 
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:41:25
I commend you for explaining it thoroughly but I am not sure it's needed. Hear me out, then ignore me. 
Like everyone else, I've use fiat all my life. I didn't understand the workings of it, I didn't need to, I just knew it had value and I could trade it for stuff I needed / wanted.
With bitcoin, I still don't really understand most of it, I just know that it's like currency, I can buy stuff with it, get paid in it and I get to keep hold of the actual coins, like storing money fiat under the floor boards in the garage. 
I think for most people that would be enough information, it's something that has value and then they can learn about it themselves in their own time, in their own way.
In the unfortunate event of a death, a partner would have so much to think about, that just to know not to throw it away would be enough. When they are ready to deal with it, they'll research it. 
Like I said, ignore me, we all are different and have different ways of presenting information to others. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:14:17
I wish you every success, I love the idea
@_date: 2016-07-03 11:54:14
