Was talking to some dude after he pumped a token by purchasing a ton at once, and holding. He flat out thinks that the stock market will crash this year. Doesn’t know how it’ll impact crypto though. But man, it would suck ass if it took crypto down with it.

I've actually seen that video, hence 'hilariously lazy with his videos.' Sorry your joke fell flat. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:41:21
No, not at all. Anything crypto on this scale is bad news for all crypto.

It’s not hard to see why people would look to banks and wall street traders, and even the media. You’re asking people to totally get out of their own environment where they feel safe to venture off to.... reddit. 
Imagine a 50 year old lady trying to navigate to reddit or what not and investing in crypto. There’s just so many assholes willing to scam folks, there’ll be a time when banks will turn to crypto and invite their clients to buy from them. It’ll take time. Until then, enjoy these low prices on quality coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:23:53
yeah that's true. but why, I've been going all in before the holidays and I think this dip is a fire sale.... I expect cryptos to shoot up after Christmas. This is crazy... but your comment does makes sense.

I hit my weekly limit on my debit card so I just used all of my alt coins to purchase more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:59:55

Didn't China just shut down exchanges, not necessarily ban bitcoin outright? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:11:43
Unregulated currency and unregulated exchanges are two different things. Both bitcoin and bcash investors are going to lose money because of this recklessness. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:45:45

Wtf, those people are insane to crucify Andreas like that. Fuck them, he’s the reason why the Canadian government hasn’t shit the bed on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:24:31
I'd buy a whole Ethereum and then put the rest on Bitcoin, only if it's FU money. Like if I had kids and sh*t I'd probably blow 75% of what you're thinking if it isn't FU money. If you have a family and savings then I would have second thoughts but I'd still go ham on bitcoin and Ethereum (just enough to not get a divorce).

What does fud stand for? Fear something something? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:07:47
I think his argument is that bitcoin is unofficially the worlds currency. If you’re smart with your money and your country’s currency is shitting the bed, you want to convert your money to a more stable currency, that used to be the US dollar. 
Now that first world countries Economy is heavily dependent on one another it kinda doesn’t really matter, so what are our options? Move it to a currency that isn’t manipulated by these governments, it’s the only option we’ve got.

@_date: 2017-12-13 06:42:58
There’s a lot of misinformation in this subreddit, some people are flat out lying about coinbase not locking in price when purchasing via bank account. I myself saw that and decided to do a transfer, and coinbase sent an email stating that it will take 2-4 business days. 
They should just disable this feature, what’s the point of depositing cash from your bank account when you can buy and lock in price? - rant
Also, these people have no where to go and need guidance. There are exchange reps weaving through this subreddit to help and prevent their brand from becoming shit. 
Their posts will also help newbies on what to do to either avoid their mistakes or pm the rep that decided to reach out to the OP.
Plus we’re all paying ridiculous fees on top of ridiculous fees to use their app, these companies are raking in the dough, and they should provide us what we pay them for.

About a week ago someone from Venezuela wrote on this subreddit explaining the situation of Venezuela, and how bitcoin is saving him and his family from starvation and death. 
It’s weird getting someones perspective first then reading an article that’s kind of dry.

Oh shit
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:04:56
You can tell that we're living in the past when we're trying to buy literal currency with old money that moves slow AF! Coinbase has me capped, banking transfers take forever, paypal is slow as shit, and you have till 12PM to wire the money to get into coinbase/gdax same day. 
Money is so slow and these shit institutions are costing me money for every minute I wait! AhhhH!
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:22:53
I guess it’s better than living paycheck to paycheck... but dip to dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:53:37
They really need competition.... so fucking over coinbase and their weekly limited. Wtf....
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:07:15
Yes they do, there’s so much misinformation on this subreddit. I’ve been told too many different things that it is currently costing me money (bank transfer) when I should just have bought using my bank account to lock on the current price (contrary to what I read from a certain redditor from on this sub). 
I’ve also been told too many times that coinbase does not insure your bitcoins but only your fiat - which you clearly linked proof. Sometimes this sub drives me bananas, but it’s all I have and I’m not crazy enough to go to /btc.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:14:43
Even themselves?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:44:49
I can’t watch this, but my guts telling me that bitcoin won’t dip enough for everyone and their grandma to by one whole coin and then jump back up. It’s either going to dip to a couple k..... and.... I have no idea what’s next. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:42
Was up last night and coinbase was definitely having some tech issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:17:30
I watched a bitcoin documentary months ago because I was researching about bitcoin (noob) and this guy was in it talking about cash funding wars and making kids fight, etc etc. he seemed so ungenuine and just rubbed me the wrong way. I then went to sub btc and saw adverts about this dude... ugh I just felt so it of place. Glad I stuck here.

If you go to the finance subreddit and you read a success story (any success story on reddit really) you’ll see a few redditors beg to help them out in the comment section. You won’t believe how many people will pm the OP asking for money.

Makes sense that he did it. He probably found out what really happened since he worked at coinbase and still has his connections, so he said fuck it. He ain’t no roger ver fan and he’s pretty open about shady altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:01:27
I wonder if India will surge bitcoin’s price like South Korea did, and China before them.

Muh feelings are hurt, you did it congrats. Slow clap* 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:29:40
That’s very odd, since 1 Venezuelan Bolívar equals
0.10 US Dollar how is bitcoin so much more expensive then in Venezuela? It seems like some force is stunting Venezuelans from crashing the bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:50

On a lighter note, I told my friend about bitcoin today. He decided to google bitcoin, and the first thing that popped up was bitcoin.org. I was sooo happy.

I think it’s common sense now that if any county’s currency fails bitcoin will get a boost. I suspect that when the US starts to see another recession because of the recent bill that was passed, bitcoin will soar. What worries me is what wall street can do to it. 
Edit: Yes I'm talking about the tax reform bill. And no, I like the vast majority of the republicans that voted for this bill did not read it because it was 'publicly' released hours before it was voted on with handwritten edits. Also, there's a census among economists and legitimate research groups that this tax bill will be disastrous. Here's an independent source: 
It's quite unfortunate, but this will boost bitcoin (if wallstreet doesn't get involved) at a huge cost. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:56:40
He’s the reason why a lot the old gang got in early. He’s also been a huge advocate for bitcoin and has talked down the Canadian government from regulating it.

It's odd though, they wouldn't get their money in time for christmas. Why pull out now?

I read somewhere (months ago) that Chinese citizens were going crazy over bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:19:31
I completely agree. I think it came at a perfect time because the need for it was so great. There’s just no way for working white/blue collars to get ahead when we start our careers in debt. When banks gave us options to get a shit % savings account, inflation, and long ass wait times... bitcoin came along and filled a void. No more of that shit, I feel like I found reddit again, whereas before I was just constantly refreshing cracked.com
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:13:54
What’s your opinion on the impact of futures to bitcoin? 
Also, do you think it’s mainstream now? Or is it about to become mainstream, because there are still so “few” that bought in.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:42:39
What’s mt.gox?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:25:01
I bought a little more today. What got me to actually “invest” was when bitcoin hit 3 or 4K, news hit the front page, and a redditor commented “A wise man bought bitcoin in the early days, a smart man buys bitcoin now.” Or something. Along those lines. 
I was actually going to purchase some when a long ass time again when someone got caught by the tsa for having bitcoin “coins” but I couldn’t figure how to so I completely forgot about it until a couple months ago. 
Also, screw coinbase fees.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:45:43
Why is it accelerating so fast? Is it normal for this to happen this late at night and then “correct” itself in the morning. And what forces cause it to “correct” itself?

Wtf, you sure it’s on Chinese TV?

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:07:35
Bitcoin is priced differently across exchanges (which I think is pretty stupid). I would follow  which reflects the price you stated. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:57:59
I would invest before the holiday break, tbh we’re all expecting a big lift and no ones sure this there’ll be a dip between then and now. Just my two cents. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:37:49
Well the thing about crypto is to never day trade. So you can do both, just invest what you can and focus on your business. That's probably the best advice I can give you, since I also own a small side business on top of my full time job (keeps my mind off crypto). 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:34:44
I told my lawyer cousin to get in on bitcoin before it exploded and he just shut me down like a pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:53:58
Yeah, before it was criminals and thugs only use bitcoin. Now right before futures on Sunday, they’re pumping up articles like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:31:19
Hey there, 
Its really easy to reject this weird new currency as a scam. But if you truly research and dig through it, you’ll learn more about fiats and why bitcoin is necessary. Just the other day, someone from Venezuela posted on this subreddit thanking bitcoin for preventing him and his family from starving to death, only after his dad died because he couldn’t get access to basic medication.
It’s both crazy and scary how fast it’s moving, but it’s a need that everyone around the world has. From first world countries (storing their money as bitcoin in case another recession happens) to 3rd world countries where having a phone amounts to having a bank. 
It’s about time this happened and I hope you dig a little deeper on why this is exploding.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:19:43
Those fuckers, wtf. Is there another way where I can buy instantly and then move it to coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:45:06
Dude this looks like straight up market manipulation. It's not a natural dip:

How’s Tai a scammer? Charging X amount to newbs on how to invest in crypto? He’s providing a service that can be attained anywhere else for less and sometimes free. 
With free content, you have to search YouTube and kind of know what you’re looking for. With Udemy or any service close to that, they’re not advertising as much as he is. 
Look, this guy isn’t running a ponzi scheme, he’s not stealing people’s money, and his content hopefully isn’t shit. 
But we can’t bash this guy without taking a look at his content.
Also, I know this will get downvotes but whatever, hopefully a few will think more critically.

Looks like r/investing is coming over to shit on the bitcoin crypto community. And yeah I’ve seen some crypto followers talk shit over there as well.
