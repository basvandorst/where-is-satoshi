That is roughly 170000 Satoshis per person. If we equate that with US Cent that would only be $1700. That is not future proof. If we equate a Satoshi with a higher dollar value we lose the ability to pay cheap stuff in small amounts with btc.

I can in theory agree with that. I wonder though if another better cryptocurrency could come around.

My limited understanding is there is a 10 minute wait time? Like a supermarket customer could spend a btc and if the shop isn't waiting for validation the customer could walk out with the groceries and try to double spend the btc again? Honest question.

So... with the recent skyrocketing chart, what is roughly your current net worth?

That is a good reason why Bitcoin won't be used as a currency as so many here dream. It will always be an object of speculation, pumped and dumped by big players, and as such its value will vary wildly.

I wondered how difficult that would be or forbidden by the protocol. I guess I have to take your word for it

Don't deceive yourself. The market power behind oil is massive, it is literally needed to fuel the economy, and still big price shocks or speculation bubbles happen.
