Yeah? Well my dad could beat up your dad.

You made the paper wallet, lost it, and stumbled upon it again with time hop? If so that's some dumb luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:35:22
No problem. Yeah it is fairly simply, just make sure you play around with it a bit first and read up on it too before making a key that you actually plan to use. If you take all the necessary precautions, this is one of the safest ways to store your bitcoin. 
Also, thanks for the Gold!

Owning that much bitcoin doesn't mean jack for your day to day life unless you can quickly and easily convert it to fiat.

Use [this]( Website. Download it with the zip link at the bottom left and load it on a pc or raspberry pi that has never been on the internet before to be extra safe. Otherwise, you can navigate to the website, take your pc offline, then follow the steps. 
Once you've generated your wallet, print it with a usb cable directly to your printer and you now have a paper wallet with a unique private key thats never been seen by anyone but you.

You mean buy a paper wallet that at one time was printed by a random person before this scratch off sticker was applied.
I would never trust a private key I didn't generate myself.

Seems like you are the shitskull, mate.

You can download the paper wallet generating website to a flash drive (it's just an html file) open it on a pc not connected to the internet (or a raspberry pi) and generate your wallet that way. The key is generated by using your randomly generated noise and an algorithm to create a unique address that is not done online.

Different people comprehend literature in different ways my dude. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:03:01
Please no
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:43:54
Thats the benefit for the buyer to want to use bitcoin right? But why would the seller want to accept bitcoin to then turn around and convert it to cash anyway?
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:55:14
Well.... Care to answer the question, or are you just full of yourself. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:50:48
You call his question dumb yet you clearly can't provide a good answer. If it's a dumb question the answer should be pretty obvious, yet it isn't. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:33:07
You answer the question like I implied there truly isn't a good reason. I'm not even the one who asked the question, I just thought it was a valid question to ask. Yet you still respond with your smug condescension. Have fun with your sorry life. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:14:06
The article doesn't explain why the seller would rather take bitcoin than cash, when they exchanged the bitcoin for cash anyway.
So again, got an answer to the "stupid question"?
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:40:20
And I appreciate the answers, which took this long comment chain for you to provide. 
The snippet below is what comes off as smug. 


You are implying that I am young and unable to think outside the box. In reality, I was probing you to see your train of thought since you started out with such a sarcastic response and referred to the initial question as dumb. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:49:38
How is it living under a bridge? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:00:08
Bruh... 
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:43:04
I agree. We should start a sub that's about bitcoin information and news without the memes and shit posting. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:42:59
I've been on this sub for about a month now; I find it extremely frustrating. The entire subreddit is a huge circlejerk.
