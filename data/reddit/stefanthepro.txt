Prices are really inflated. Unfair and unfavourable to miners. We used to buy Block Erupters for $6.50, then they sky rocketed to insane prices (demand), all for .3GH. Now with limited release hardware, everything's overpriced and mostly unprofitable, at least to current BTC prices. 
So yes, if they were that cheap, you'd be a lot better off.
For $700 (or less hopefully) you can get an S1 (with the Next gen due shortly) hashing at between 180GH &amp;amp;amp; 200GH, that's a much better ratio, that is much more profitable. At that rate, you could buy a Terahash overnight for $3500 and I know of a few who have done just that. (That hardware even has warranty).
Ratio: $3.50-$3.88/GH + PSU/Power 
= Profitable
Waiting is always a wise decision.
Though there are always wiser decisions to be made with some thought and diligence. 
As always, IMHO.
Good Luck and Coin On!

Be careful and if it's not at or below $5/GH you're wasting time

If you want a regular, non-social-network login, go get verified somewhere else. This is an option that so many people need.

It does give you a chance and I still use all the equipment I have to mine everything I can because with BTC rising in popularity (this is the year of discovery) we can hope/predict that the value will rise. If the value skyrockets, all the hardware currently on the market breaks even and/or profits.
So yes, it does give an opportunity.

Dont be daft, we need a solution like this, I have been running out of ways to buy coin with a Visa and these guys have a solid plan. Dont Knock their beginnings.

Reading this thread now is humbling, isnt it?

What about mining the SHA256 fraction coins like PPC or Terracoin?

what about mining a newer altcoin (anything above 100GH/s seems to dominate) and then exchanging it?
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:23:24
&amp; if you do, tell us!
