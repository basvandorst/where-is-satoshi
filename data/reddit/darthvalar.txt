Call it Bitcash and go after the BTC ticker and watch Roger freak out because he didn’t think of it first. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:50:25
No sarcasm, banks are the devil. Thats why we're into crypto to begin with.

Swatch to Gemini if you’re only buying BTC/ETH using USD. Otherwise switch to Binance or COSS for alts. COSS will have a fiat gateway soon. PM me for an intro and referral links

COSS.io or Binance. PM me for an intro and referral link

I am very satisfied with my Trezor, never had an issue with it. I would recommend waiting for the Trezor T while avoiding the cheaper Ledger. 
And I would recommend both Electrum and Armory for software wallets as well.

I'm shilling Binance hard tonight.. it really is a good exchange.. PM me for a referral link.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:50:20
Getting out quick is for the weak. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:39:32
Cost can determine a lot. Subscribe to r/ledgerwallet and just gawk at the amount of user issues.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:47:14
He is.

Who would win? A billion-dollar Cryptocurrency exchange or one commenting boi?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:54
I haven't had an issue with Binance yet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:05:20
I don’t support Bcash but I don’t support this lie of a story either. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:47
They don't offer fiat trading pairs. They use their own native token BNB to provide a 50% discount on fees. I don't use the BNB token, I just use the BTC or ETH trading pairs for alts I'm interested in.
If you're looking for a good solution for ACH, I would recommend Gemini. Although if you use a smaller bank or credit union (never use banks, duh) you will need to initiate a transfer with a bank wire before Gemini will approve ACH to the smaller institutions.

r/Buttcoin would love you for this.

Well he’s not wrong.

Excellent article. Will certainly be sharing this with friends and family.

There are literally 10 better brands than KIA according to your source which reconfirms my bias.

For anyone using Apple Numbers to track their gains, this is great news.

Do yourself a favor and connect your conbase account to GDAX, move your coin to GDAX, then xfer to Binance to avoid conbase's exorbitant fees. 
And then sign up with Gemini to buy your BTC with USD before xfering to Binance for alts.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:24:22
Yes, trust your already high risk investment with a blatantly stated inferior product. Makes good sense.
Reminds me of KIA owners.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:52:15
That man just said “pussy riot” on stage. That’s my dude. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:23:52
1. Remove your phone number from your Coinbase profile.
2. Change your phone number.
Or expect to be rooted one day. 
Never link your actual phone number to anything crypto related.

Bitcoiners only watch one chart. This belongs in r/cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:17:37
That’s what you get for trading a deflationary asset.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:20:46
Again, any product that feels the need to offer a holiday discount proves that it is inferior to its counterpart that doesn’t need to offer a discount in order to compete.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:03:54
I don’t understand how people see cheaper as better??
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:05:27
My advice would be to sub to both r/ledgerwallet and r/trezor and look at the difference in user issues between the two and you’ll see which is the better product. (Trezor)

Downvoted for hashtags.

Unfortunately, I am not on your list but I appreciate your efforts OP.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:02:58
Or how about
(X amount of BTC * $8000)  = $ value of BTC
And then
($Value - $100) / 100 = percent gained
Or is this off?? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:17:12
They accept btc as payment!
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:33:55
Good on you my man. This is my new favorite bitcoin story.

10/10 would ban. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:51:33
Fair enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:38:37
Apple Numbers offers this as well. I use CURRENCY(“BTC”,”USD”,price) to display the USD price per Yahoo! Finance. And then I use this amount multiplied by my btc balance subtracting additional costs to give me my current profit in USD. Very handy. 
Only problem is that I can’t get ETH to calculate properly using Numbers. I’ve tried the (ETHUSD=X) ticker provided by Yahoo! but no luck getting the code to run. Hoping for a resolution.

Are you trying to pass off an Alex Grey piece as your own?? Not cool man.

You gotta go to twitter for the real discussions. Reddit is for the noobs.

Apple Stocks app widget will you show you btc prices so you can remove that coinbase virus from your phone. And it won’t shill you shitcoins either. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:16:43
Can we begin referring to them by their more proper name of BTMs??
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:06:20
I love how the reality of this twitter poll doesn’t match the upvotes of this post. The Bcash trolls are always on watch.

I am going to repeat everyone else because it is the right answer: bitWallet.

I was unaware of this feature. I don’t use either coinbase or USAA’s banking services but I went ahead and linked the accounts just to encourage the adoption. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 01:41:11
Ok roger.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:50:46
But we hate coinbase, ‘member?
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:49:55
It is orders of magnitude safer if you used a 25th word passphrase. If not, you should generate a new seed and passphrase and then transfer your keys to the new wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:08:12
If this is for Filipinos then why English...
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:06:48
Yes, using the same Trezor would be fine. The physical device is irrelevant, what matters is the seed phrase. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:46:39
Uhhh.. but they ALL definitely speak Tagalog or a dialect of it.
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:31:40
I suppose that is just as well, I didn’t know that was an option.
