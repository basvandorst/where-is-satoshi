wtf is your problem?

"Attacks it" grow up
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:25:27
The open free market is attacking bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:28:46
What a joke. If bch never happened we couldn't see how bitcoin could be with bigger blocks/0conf and eventually Graphene. What are you seriously afraid of. You got both coins given to you. You can't lose and the market can decide what's better. Instead you guys just talk like everything is an attack. Its so cringe
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:33:29
You're the moron.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:14:31
Except the issue is you just assume block size increase is the only thing they did. They re added 0 conf. And they have plans for implementing Graphene to be even faster. They never said they were against secondary layers only that the current technology isn't there so they fixed it. Yet everyone thinks not a 1mb or nothing. And the people behind it??? There is 7 dev teams behind it. No one owns it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:36:11
Rip out segwit? It was just never implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:57
Or maybe its the market putting money where they see more growth. You really think 1 or 2 people have enough money for this manipulation? you must be dellusional, the 24hr volume is more than 10x roger ver networth. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:13:09
Who is BCH? Its a currency. No one owns it. Jesus Christ. The people in here who Dont understand a free open market. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:17:30
Yeah and that's what we are discussing. And I understand bitcoin is still fast. But western union currently is cheaper and all other Cryptos. Clearly BTC has an issue
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:11:49
You seen the white paper. The title is p2p currency. Not p2p scarcity. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:12
What im saying is that its just a free open market and the market is deciding. But you are correct, Roger ver could potentially start it but still needs A LOT more cash behind him to do it.

Whats wrong with community college?
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:44:00
Yeah because hard drives in the future will never get bigger and internet won't get faster...
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:14:56
So shady, adding a new currency... and then all of a sudden its an attack on bitcoin. If bitcoin is so good and strong, then dont worry it will work out for you. The market will realise whats worth it or not in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:42:37
People get emotional especially when its about their own wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:18:50
Yeah, so retarded, he likes a currency with really low fees and its fast. wow
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:17:17
Sorry what exactly did BCH do here?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:40
How? how on earth is this an attack? like seriously, plz tell me exactly how their is people purposely attacking bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:52
Why? Because it doesnt work for Bitcoin?
I could use BCH, ETH to pay for coffee and would go through quick and not have high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:17:38
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:19:10
Yeah fair enough
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:30:43
Its not default. It says it will create a wallet by default. So u will have both wallets by default... How is this so hard for this sub
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:30:28
| miner-controlled scamcoin
its literally the same miners? they have the same algo. no?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:36:16
Why is it orchestrated by BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:39:25
Did you lose $15?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:21:20
Its the 2nd biggest market cap Cryptocurrency. Not a scam at all. Not even close
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:19:26
Found the American.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:31:34
Obviously you have no idea how markets work. Why dont you compare the number of bad subprimes compared to the entire housing market cap at the time of the crash? hurr durr. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:58:55
The issue is with parity, not Ethereum
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:25:44
Try Ethereum. Will costs cents and send it in 10seconds
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:35:31
It has both. I literally just instaleld it. it has both right there.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:12:51
well you dont understand how the market works, just because the market cap is ~$130 billion, doesnt mean you have that much of people waiting to buy it. If I dump $100,000 worth of BTC it might move the price $1, which is a few million in market cap lol. Now imagine $600 million.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:22:53
I didnt say you said that, I was just giving an example because you said $600million in tethers wont have a big impact.
Look what happened to MtGox in terms of what was taken out compared to the market cap of BTC at the time. It doesnt take much to create an avalanche.
And yes if Tether went under, the entire $600mill, which is used to purchase BTC, ETH whatever will go down with it. If you look at Tethers, Just goes up and up, no one is really cashing out.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:07:36
Oh you want an argument?
Ok well if youre making a profit on gains, you declare it and pay tax on the profits you make. Just like you would for normal Currency trading or Stock trading. Just because you own the bitcoin yourself, doesnt mean you shouldnt have to pay Tax. Tax is their to help the country(whichever it is) to pay for all kinds of things, roads, hospitals etc. you get it. 
If eventually we were 100% all cryptos..(all hypothetical here) you think we shouldnt have to pay tax at all? lol. As much as I hate Tax like everyone else, its still needed. If you want to pay lower Tax maybe you should just move to Hong Kong or something.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:08:34
Okay? well go live outside of society in the woods by yourself. You dont need any currency or government. enjoy your life.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:26:23
Ok... but it still would cost a lot cheaper. It would cost the same in Bitcoin Fees as the western union Fees. Bitcoin is good as a stable source of value but sending under $100 is pretty stupid on BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:50:00
Lmao. So when its the other way around its all "satoshi doesn't know everything" . the hate for BCH is because you're scared BCH actually works and you probably sold it when it was low. I feel sad for you
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:48:31
You're a moron if you really seriously think. The whole market crashed because of that. You seriously must delusionally hate It to not think straight
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:29:14
You dont know anything about my portfolio but sure. You're so awesome cos its worth more per coin. Grats mate. U must be heaps rich ey. Siiiic. Clearly satoshi can't know everything. But clearly BTC right now is not a good state
