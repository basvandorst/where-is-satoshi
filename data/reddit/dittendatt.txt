Except that "buy and hold" is extremely ingrained and generally accepted as a good strategy. Many people here are long term bulls.

No, I am sorry, but this is just wrong. If you know programming, try simulating both strategies for the following simple model for short term, supply/demand-driven volatility.
y_ n = 0.99 y_(n-1) + 0.01 u_n + 100
Where u is a zero mean, unit variance white noise sequence.

Bitcoin is not well adopted. This means that there comes floods of new money all the time rocketing the price. When the market becomes saturated and the net flow becomes smaller, the value will stabilize. Until it stabilizes it will be extremely dangerous for merchants to hold it, so they will want to get rid of it ASAP.
But when it stabilizes bitcoin B2B will be very possible.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:50:05
The volatility will go down when new money stops flowing in, and everyone knows exactly what bitcoin will be used for. (Internet currency? Inflation Hedge? Global currency? Tax escape? Somalia currency?)
Right know there is lots of volatility since no one really knows where bitcoin will be in three years.

What I am saying is that Asicminer has revenue in BTC and costs in Dollar. So if the dollar becomes more expensive in BTC, then they need to use more BTC to pay their bills. Thus profit in BTC goes down, and stock price in BTC should also go down.

If you use an encrypted connection to your VPN provider, then they basically need the cooperation of the VPN provider. If it is located in the US, getting it is probably a quite simple affair. I imagine that it is slightly more involved if the provider is not US-based.

Lessons from stock markets are not directly transferable. Whether you should dollar cost average or not depends on (maybe more, I'm thinking this stuff up as I write it)
* fundamental trend component
* fundamental driven volatility (hacking, security hole discovery etc)
* irrational volatility
Consider for instance a very simple model of bitcoin's price: The price *should* be 100$/btc, but due to miners bulk offloading and stuff, the market irrationally goes up and down around this equilibrium. In this case, you will be well served by dollar cost averaging. Another model: The price is a random walk. In this case dollar cost averaging will not work (don't invest at all). A third model: The price is increasing exponentially. In this case dollar cost averaging will not work (just smack everything asap).
Since the reality is a mix of these, you have to try to quantify how much each contributes to price movements. Further: the truth depends on time scale. It might be that short term movements are largely irrational, and long term movements are largely fundamental. In that case it might be a good idea to buy btc for X % of your stack every hour, while buying X % every day would have been a terrible idea.
EDIT: If you are a big player you also have to worry about moving the market yourself if you move to fast.

How can your order matching be so slow?
I heard something about invalid orders, but I still can not make sense of it? I mean a well designed order matching engine should be able to handle matching of about 10-100 million new orders per second right? I mean we are talking O(NlogN). So how can they fuck it up so badly?
