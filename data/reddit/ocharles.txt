Brit here, I never trade BTC/GBP. I just trade BTC/USD and Bitstamp lets you withdraw USD to GBP transparently.

Meditation is good,  is a really good way to get into it. I thought it would be condescending, especially as I'd already tried meditating before, but it's really not - in fact it's extremely well done.
I think the entire world could benefit from meditation. Learning to hit the brakes, stop, and look critically at the world around you to see it how it actually is, is a very powerful trait to have.

I agree that nofap is too far, but I'm in support of no porn. At least for me, it's lead to addictive behaviour, no matter how mild it is.

Nothing in N London either, boo.

The general argument goes that the market will dictate the price. I'm also not clear on this, but right now you BCH are worth nothing because no one is trading them, whereas your BTC are still valuable. The price will adjust as the market responds to this fork - imagine if half the market decide they prefer BCH over BTC - they will presumably dump their BTC and move to BCH - so the price of BTC lowers and the price of BCH rises. This is an exaggeration, but is hopefully a valid explanation.
As far as I can tell, free money only exists if *both* forks end up equally priced.

Geez, a lot of assholes here.

I think this is more than just currency v company. Bitcoin is a significantly new way of dealing with money, so it's fair to call it a technology - a technology that could operate in the vicinity of PayPal in the forseeable future.

This isn't necessarily a true fact - it could of course fall and never come back. Such is the risk of trading. But to supply an anecdote, with the last spike in price I did some crap trading and lost money. I walked away with my remaining BTC, and now that we're at a new high I've made back the money I lost and am profitable once again - but it took a *lot* of patience. Now I just need to see how much I'll fuck it up this time ;)

More wondering if they have actually seen "a female" (or as we commonly call them - a woman).

Yes, this was pointed out in the comment replies. I later suggested using his key and signing the latest hash block or something (and perhaps this very page's URL, as it contains the random ID of the AMA).

Oh yes, great point! Might as well include the hash of the latest block :)

Just providing a PGP signature of the message "I am Mark" signed with his private key to be verified against the public key would be quite sufficient, unless someone else has got hold of the private key.
Edit: "I am Mark" is *not* quite sufficient, as pointed out below, as it is replayable.

I think the mods should remove this post, as it is clearly defamatory. Regardless of my stance on Coinbase, this is not cool, especially if this Reddit is to be taken seriously.
If you want to have a discussion about this, then have a proper discussion.

What are the energy costs of that, if you don't mind me asking?
