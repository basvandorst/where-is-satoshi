If you take a look at the comments above mine they're clearly referring to the WORLD. At no point does anybody mention the specific continent of Africa. Besides, I hope you are aware of the fact that northern parts of Africa ARE Arab. Ffs ��
Edit. If you need specifics, check out the Pyramids built in the time of the Ancient Egyptians. It's in Africa. I'm no expert and already your point is null.

Would I be correct in assuming you also believe these other people around the world were "built" inferior to the excellence of "your" people? God just happened to pick and choose who to make "great" and who to make "savages"? Or maybe those that believe they are "great" just have more urgency for blood, rape, torture, enslavement and theft of resources on a global and systematic scale towards their peers (human beings) as long as it secures their selfish desires of natural resources and "wealth"? I'm not sure you have gotten the "animals" concept the right way around here...

Fair point but if it was strictly the "crypto"ness of the ETF that lead to it's rejection then they could easily just put this one to bed on the basis that it's crypto so a big no. The fact it still needs discussion could turn out to be the silver lining (if you're bullish)?

Thank you for such a quality reply. Really appreciate the time and effort. And after reading your reasoning I do agree with the whole difference in scope, both financially and in knowledge and sheer genius of the really good professional traders. Me personally? I'm one of the casual guys just HODLing along, supporting this drive for decentralised consensus to really take off as I believe (given what limited knowledge I do have) in this tech. You have my upvote!
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:15:21
I'm guessing you aren't very knowledgeable. For starters, the "poor countries" would be the first to have MASSES looking for security away from authorities as 1) the chances of hyper inflation is not negligible AND the chances of corruption to cease assets and wealth is a greater risk to but I'm guessing you wouldn't k own this living in a relatively stable/regulated environment where most things are "legit" And 2) I believe Turkey is a G20 nation anyway with aims to reach the top 10 economies. Whether or not that's a realistic goal is another debate but given there are circa 200 nations it surely isn't "poor", unless you have a typically American centric view of the earth where the US economy is your "normal" level indicator, then I'm guessing you think the whole world is poor in comparison right?

@_date: 2018-08-29 14:48:41
Right, so it's OK to steal it? Let me go download a copy of Linux (older version so it's more "original") and then rebrand it and call it the real Linux and try to take as many Linux handles as I can in an attempt to defraud people... THAT is what open source is? Maybe you should re-evaluate your understanding of open source. It is free to CONTRIBUTE not STEAL.

I'm actually with you on that front. However, the solution to IP laws and regulation is NOT to let any joker just re-skin whatever they like and then have the audacity to promote it as the "real" one.

Yes, and many seem capable of forking and continuing their operations in a respectful manner. The issue at hand isn't the fork, it's the retards trying to scam people into a grey area pushing their shitcoin like it's the genuine BTC... Luckily the markets aren't stupid and the price reflects how much of a "Bitcoin" a "BCash" really is... What was it hovering around 0.07 of a real BTC per latest prices?
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:56:44
If Bitcoin was a "traditional" organisation you know they would be suing the crap out of that cash thing trying to be passed off as BTC right? Go and "template" one of the "original" designs of any corporation and you can see how you are labelled a crook and sentenced accordingly... 
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:17:56
So just to clarify, you argue that bitcoin is not particularly good at Security or Scalability but proceed to state that 1) the security has and does work, just maybe it will break down in the future... Maybe... And 2) that a solution to scalability has been developed and implemented but again, in the future may not work. Maybe maybe maybe. But maybe the world gets sucked into a black hole in a weeks time? ����

Fair point. I can see this applying in extremities such as violent/organised crime especially at large scale but is "spoofing a digital trade without the intention to execute the order" really going to get the US authorities out on a manhunt across the globe, especially given that it is technically an unregulated market so participants would bear the risks associated here? This is just my opinion though I am no expert!

@_date: 2018-08-17 09:49:26
I agree, scamcoins will eventually die out, ICOs are already on their way out and with increasing regulation they will be nowhere near as easy to run/execute. However, are you inferring that anything but BTC is a scam/ICO? I do like what BTC is, and has done, but I wouldn't rule out other platforms for example Ethereum also has HUGE backing both investment wise and development wise, hardly a scam, and can see no reason for it to "die" per se.

There needs to be a regulator. Cryptos have no regulation so no "body" will go throwing resources to resolve an issue that is not in their remit. Hence the ICOs that easily run exit scams with no real legal issues.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:07:55
So then, why is there only just ONE pack of idiots trying to steal the Bitcoin brand/image then? If this is standard practice why are there not literally thousands or millions of "Bitcoin" iteration all claiming the same crap? I don't think you have sufficient grasp over the difference between CONTRIBUTION and THEFT.
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:23:45
I think about the same. Keeping it realistic, whether you make $50k USD or get to keep more and have $100k USD (assuming they're both born into it as a default way of life as opposed to being allowed to keep more mid-life) then their aspirations and goals wouldn't vary too wildly. One wouldn't be cruising in yachts while the other considers if he can even afford to run a really shitty car so I don't see a major difference in "work" done.

You're simply reciting US propaganda as EVERY single middle Eastern nation is against the creation of a new state in the region (bar Israel). The US created ISIS (or at least ensured the void that lead to ISIS was sustained) and then armed the terrorist guerillas (PYD) to the brim to help "fight" ISIS promising these guerillas land, in exchange for US control over the oil fields of northern Syria. This expands US stronghold in the region after Israel (and also promoting Israeli occupation of Palestine even beyond what was initially agreed as "Israel"). All while there was a "NATO Ally" with a proven loyalty to NATO via Afghan and Korean wars, with a standing army of over 2000 years old ready to assist in securing Northern Syria for a buffer "safe zone" where civilians could be harboured. Yet they choose to work with cavemen.... Riddle me that? ����

I take it you have never had your funds "locked" by a centralised organisation such as PPal before? The risk of these random guys/gals randomly restricting my access to MY money in itself gives me a great reason to look to Cryptos to store/transfer value as and when necessary. It doesn't take much effort to CTRL\+C and CTRL\+V a key to send off "money". This is just me though, although i'm sure there are others feeling like this...

Same way fiat can have inherent value through none other than "belief" and/or "trust" in the economy it governs, the same holds true for Bitcoin. In technology 10 years is no joke and to remain unbroken in this time even though so much value is at stake is something to be cherished. Add to that the first-mover "original" aspect of it, I see why it CAN work. No point claiming it will or won't like we're little Jesus's here and we only "vote" with our hard earned cash.

Sorry if I came across wrong but I never advocated tax evasion which is a crime. If you thought I was inferring tax evasion by maintaining the idea that one should be able to have complete control over THEIR personal wealth then that's just wrong. Would you consider a sole-trader in a cash business with no witholding-tax applicable from "an employer" a criminal? The onus is on the person with the wealth to ensure they are tax compliant. This has NOTHING to do with opening up one's "legs" for any and any old intermediary to come and pump you.

No idea about his personal circumstances in detail, however it just reiterates my point. You hand over valuables to an intermediary and they have you by the balls and believe me will not shy away from enforcing any and all power over you given that the governments give them full support in a bid to crack down on more fines/taxes they can squeeze out. Not compliant enough? They lock you away from your assets/ report you to authorities. The intermediary and/or economy having some (cyclical) troubles? You run the risk of being told you can get X amount back over Y period of time ONLY in Z circumstances. Want to take out $50k USD to buy yourself a new watch? You better get answering questions as to why/when/where/how much/which watch/why you want to pay cash and not a bank transfer/ how tight your wife's p\*ssy is etc etc etc. This is all on top of the fact that these are physical objects/items that can be taken away from you by a thief as I mentioned above.
I find (not that I use it ATM) the networks such as BTC helps you maintain your own control over your own assets with not THAT much additional know-how. I am no IT security expert and still find it relatively straight-forward to use my cold-storage solution when and if I need to. At worst, it's a nice OPTION to have whether or not everybody likes it.

Fair play. Good luck and I do hope you open that war chest in 2020 to find a few 10's of millions (USD)!
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:55:22
Nope. If you read the language being used here, coming from an entity with some reputation to maintain it seems as though they are still hard at work on this and want to ensure a working product is released. Do you have any specific part of the article/quote to suggest these are lies to cover up a failed project that will not take off despite all these people seemingly working hard to make it happen?
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:03:55

Thank you for clarifying! All makes sense now.

Not challenging this trail of thought but what was the "new interest" that caused the April run?

Yep, just as bad. Absolute scum.

Is there any "novel" way to store/gift some crypto which I can give to my daughter when she is old enough?

Bro, unless you invested &lt;1% of your overall stack you can afford to lose and you're some mad whale, I would be worried about what to find in that box in 2020! At a push, I'd keep BAT from that list, IF ANY!

I'm surprised people are trying to get an opinion through something so dense... Just give up guys! 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:35:56
Thanks for the replies. Much appreciated. I have another (probably stupid) question I want to figure out to really grasp this, even if you could point me in the direction I can research it myself. 
What then, stops the banks printing as many billions or trillions as they can shift off as debt and just tie up as many people/organisations as possible into paying them interest? Is there anything to check this power to print unlimited money and just boost profits off the real interest due on numbers they pull out of thin air as and when they want/need? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:51:23
I wasn't aware the retail banks had the authority to impact the money supply by issuing new money into the total money supply. I thought only the central bank had this power?

I'd like to see you transport $1M worth of copper or gold from New York to Hong Kong for the cost of transmitting a Bitcoin from New York to Hong Kong... I'll ignore the cost to ensure an acceptable level of security while transporting $1M worth of the metal across the planet aswell... Can you see what I am trying to explain yet? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:04:46
Are those two things mutually exclusive?

Nope. I was not defending the fact that mining metals is useless. You're still not getting the point. The point of mining metals is to obtain the ore for further processing to make into useful "things". The point of mining Bitcoin is not to further process it, but to use as a vehicle to store and transport "value". You can see the global "movement of value" and how huge that market is. That's my point here. There is no point comparing the mining of metals to the mining of Bitcoins. They are intended for different purposes. 
Just like you wouldn't build a house with "bitcoins" you wouldn't attempt to transfer large quantities of "value" with copper or physical gold as your means of transport.

That shitshow that is Ryanair is a complete joke anyway. It's like a meme-airline, the DogeCoin of the airline industry. You'd be lucky to not be bullied and/or physically harrased/attacked on their flights let alone being given the option of "cash"!
AVOID THESE COWBOYS AT ALL COSTS!!!

Add to this the fact that you can't transfer $1B of gold for pocket change. Good luck with the cost to transport + secure that shipment!

I hope so. I refuse to move my buy order. I need a 10% dip which SURELY will come. I refuse to believe the one time I play by ignoring emotions that it will be a true bull run ��

I think it all depends on what "normal" activity is on the account. If you frequently +/- 000's it should be no issue. I believe it is only deemed sensitive if &gt;10k is being transferred in or out of your bank. They will probably ask you for details of the source of the funds for anti-money laundering purposes. 
If I had to take a guess though with 1000-2000 they are not going to care. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:12:27
It actually is. Not a "European Union" country but like it or not, within Europe nonetheless. Istanbul started life as the second Rome under Eastern Romans. I'm sure the Romans were in "Europe".

Which societal duty would be "shirked"? Besides, to NOT want to be had by the balls doesn't mean you are a lawbreaker does it? Funny how people like to make fun of North Korea's regime/communism yet feel as though we are obliged to live under some "big brother" reality and if you object? Well you MUST be hiding something and you are a criminal. AMIRITE? Being a submissive sheeple /= being law abiding... Same as NOT wanting to be raped over ones OWN assets/wealth /= being a criminal. Quiet a distinction some need to wrap their head around.

This is why a lot of these idiots think it is not in Europe. The Turks have conquered their way over from their far eastern roots to the doorsteps of central Europe. They are so butt-hurt they deny it to this very day lol!
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:10:14
Agreed, but that 5&amp; is still in Europe.... So does that make it in Africa? no, it is still in Europe. If I have 5&amp; of my portfolio in BTC, does that mean I have no BTC?

This. Im still teaching myself how to spot the feeling of FOMO and stopping any trade decisions until some time has passed and I feel like I can think rationally again. It's not easy which is why it whales use the prices to "push" your finger to hit that buy/sell button no matter if you're your down!

No but to ensure the reality of such cases is brought directly in front of many newbies around here I believe is good for the community as it helps to keep people a little more alert. So it's not exactly a complete waste of time. Not everyone is aware of these very real possibilities.

He has stolen credit/debit cards and he needs to cash these out without putting his own name to it. He will use you as the fool and you will be the one blacklisted for fraud/ charged with crime/ reported to the National Crime Agency (NCA) in the UK while he drifts off into the sunset with howmuch ever he managed to "cash out" through you and multiple other get-rich-quick n00bz he reeled in like you... If it was so safe why wouldn't he use his GF/siblings/parent/family/friends accounts and treat them to half the profits? Please just USE YOUR BRAIN.

How is the transfer cost $750m with BTC? Or are you ignorant enough to compare the volatility of fiat which is how old? compared to BTC which is how old? Hold this down vote for the retardation...
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:56:44
So let me get this right... You expect thr "digital currency" to take over the world to be the most liquid, least volatile and most widely accepted currency across the entire human population inside 9 years of it's existence or else "it's failed"?
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:11:45
I also do not trust any centralized exchange especially run from some random off shore location. However, this OP is clearly avoiding answering any questions that will bring to light the real circumstances at hand so I would trust him even less. If these posts simply put the issue into peoples minds of not trusting exchanges I believe there is a silver lining after all.

Are these the smart people that effectively have "good friend" in the right places so use that and the information that it brings to transfer wealth from the unfortunate via the stock market to line their pockets and at the same time gag the unfortunate by acting like some "all knowing genius"?

Thanks to these horror stories, I treat exchanges as no-mans land between being your own bank and the state trying to keep you hostage. We (currently) NEED exchanges with good liquidity to trade, however they can also work for the other side and f\*ck you. If I want to trade, I deposit a small part of my stack, execute and immediately run back to safety (cold storage).

Thing is though, let just assume BTC is widely accepted and is virtually the de-facto currency of "Earth". Until we have people born and die in this new economy relying only on BTC, it will be extremely difficult (impossible?) for people to not compare to Fiat value. To this day people like to think about fiat as "back in 19XX $1000 could buy you X!!!". This will simply be (new luxury car priced at 3BTC) and people comparing to the old days "this would be priced at $120,000 back in 2018!".
