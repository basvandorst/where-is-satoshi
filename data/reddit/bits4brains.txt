All true statements and very sad, indeed.
But that doesn't take away from the discussion at hand.
The recipients of this donation are probably not in a position where they can move to the states.
In order to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps, one must first have bootstraps (basic necessities of life).
It's a lot easier to find time for innovation when you're not worried where you and yours will get their next meal.

I just got rid of my FOMO with a BULLISH purchase of Bitcoin. I hope to become WHALE after this goes to the MOON with an ATH MARKET CAP. 
I will avoid the FUD by putting everything in COLD STORAGE and come back in a few years if the BLOCKCHAIN doesn't FORK too many times before the BEARISH FIAT crashes and burns.

We are a product of our environment. If you were born over there in Africa you'd have the same circumstances as them -- only knowing what those around you know.
Expecting people to figure out everything themselves somewhat ridiculous (considering you don't do that yourself). You're depending on all of the knowledge and engineering that went into building this 'network' called the 'internet', the computer you're using, etc. It's likely that neither you, nor your family had any part in working on the science and engineering involved in creating these conveniences. 
That same idea can be applied to all the luxuries that you benefit from and have contributed nothing to. Stop leeching off of societies innovations and figure these things out yourself. Live by your own principles and expectations.

They were in a position that allowed them to get where they've gotten. Looking at Wikipedia, what's Elon's origin? 




Do you think the recipients of UBI have parents in these sort of positions? Unlikely. Their parents are most likely not even together.
Circumstances have an impact on opportunity, and just how far one's "motivation" can take them.

If you have a Google account on your phone maybe you can look at your phones travel timeline to determine where they went. It should show where they went every night aka (home).

But you can buy another Monopoly board game to 'print more money'.

What site do you all recommend for the Bitcoin main site? You're all telling them to take Bitcoin.com off, but what site are you suggesting they replace it with?

Seems a pretty good site, unbiased. Definitely better than Bitcoin.com. Thanks for sharing.

Very nice explanation. 
"Why would a miner sell a Bitcoin for less than the cost to mine it?" -- such a powerful statement in explaining where some of bitcoin's value comes from.

Reddington is that you?

Large if in charge.
