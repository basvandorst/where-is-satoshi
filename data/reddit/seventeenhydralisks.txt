Just so you know, no one bought anything from the creator of Bitcoin. Bitcoins were mined by anyone who felt like running the code, so they were fairly evenly distributed throughout the community for months or years before anyone started buying them from anyone else. It's not like some sort of pyramid scheme with the creator sitting at the top shilling out the product. Just FYI.

I don't understand how this could be trusted. Either:
1. The private key is visible and anyone who sees it can steal the BTC, including yourself after checking it or the seller immediately after getting your money.
2. The private key isn't visible, and you are trusting the seller when they tell you that the key is included.

An alternative to the complicated process you described is to purchase a hardware wallet (I use a Ledger Nano S) but they can be pricey and take a while to arrive.
Also, to answer your last two questions, you can continue sending to that same public address over and over as long as you like, and you can type that public address into a block explorer website to see the balance and all previous transactions. Doing this is safe, because the public address doesn't need to be kept private (thus the name *public* address).

Also, I'm a big proponent of hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S. I'm not sure why someone wouldn't use one if they are dealing with more than ~$1000 worth of crypto.

You should always work under the assumption that the physical hardware wallet device could become lost/broken/stolen at any time. This means properly storing your recovery mnemonic seed, so that restoring your wallets onto a new hardware device is trivial.

This is factually wrong. Owning any amount of Bitcoin does not grant you any power except the power to transfer that Bitcoin to another address. Miners are the ones with the power to "dictate monetary policy", and their numbers are significantly more distributed.

The same thing that happened to Bitcoin when Satoshi fell off the face of the planet. Other people take up the mantle and the project continues on.

And then what? If they delete the repo, someone else will re-upload it. If they commit malicious code, people will find out and fork sooner or later. I can see it being an issue with closed source software, but when everything is open and development is decentralized, I'm not sure what we need to worry about.

You've got it backwards. We currently *have* net neutrality. My ISP charges me the same price whether I stream video from YouTube or Bing Videos, they're neutral. If we were to *lose* net neutrality, then yes, this type of thing is almost guaranteed to happen. In fact, [here's a post]( currently on the top of which lists a number of examples where ISP have attempted to do stuff like this.

I'll be curious to see if they mention the dollar value of a Bitcoin in the episode, and how far off from the current dollar value that number is.

Some possibilities:
* blockchain.com took your money. Not likely since it's a fairly well respected site I think.
* You visited a fake version of blockchain.com by following a malicious link or using an infected machine that redirected you without you realizing it.
* The private key given to you by blockchain.com was leaked, either by the site handling it improperly (again, not likely since they're well respected) or by yourself handling it improperly. There could be malware on your machine looking for private keys which could have grabbed it at some point. My money's on this one, because there are so many possible ways to leak a private key if your machine is on the Internet.

Note that you only pay those huge transaction fees when moving the bitcoin from one wallet to another, not on every trade you make on the exchange itself. If you want to reduce this fee while getting bitcoin on the exchange, you can buy a coin with lower fees (ETH or LTC), transfer that to the exchange, and trade that coin for BTC. Now you have BTC to do whatever you want with, and you paid a tiny transaction fee plus a tiny trading fee to the exchange, definitely the better option when you're talking about small numbers like this.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:06:37
It's not about how much you can afford, it's about what percent gain you receive. Whether you can only put in $10 like the guy in that thread, or if you're putting in $10,000, you're going to receive the same percent gain either way. In that guy's case, if he had put in $10 at $400 a piece, his $10 would now be $237.
Of course, this was before 5+ dollar trasnfer fees, so you might be right. I just put in a little money from each paycheck, so I barely notice a difference, but get to slowly build up a portfolio :)

You're thinking of soft forks.
A soft fork is when a change is made which everyone agrees with. The chain does not diverge.
A hard fork is when a change is made which some people disagree with. In this case, the chain diverges into two separate chains. Ethereum has only had one hard-fork, the ETC-ETH hard fork that you mentioned.

@_date: 2017-11-28 21:14:14
Okay I did some more research, and now I think I understand. A hard fork is a change to the code which is not backwards compatible, so it *would* cause a chain split if it was not adopted by everyone. My mistake was assuming that 'hard fork' meant that a chain split had occurred. Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:42:49
Oh, was it mentioned in the previews or something? That's hilarious, I can just imagine noobs going to buy it and being like "WTF is this price?!" XD

Gotcha, so a hard fork is just *one* way that a chain split *might* occur. Thanks for enlightening.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:37:04
Sounds smart! One thing that you might want to consider is to make a small test transaction to your paper wallet first, and then verify that you are sending the funds to the correct wallet and can see them appear in the public address. This way you end up paying the transfer fee twice, but if you did something wrong and send it to the wrong address, you don't lose your entire stash :)

What banks let you do with your money is not the same as what the government lets you do with your money. Banks are just trying to reduce the number of complaints they receive about users being scammed by crypto-currency related ponzi schemes. Governments have not made any rulings for or against cryptocurrencies at this time. You've got nothing to worry about unless you see headlines saying "[YOUR COUNTRY] bans cryptocurrency purchases".

Oh, I thought we were talking about an absence of fiat, as in Bitcoin has taken over.
If fiat and Bitcoin are both still around and can both be used to buy pizza, then yeah, there will always be exchange rates between the three.
Currently that's the case, and it makes sense to price things in fiat and just calculate how much BTC that is on the fly at the time of payment, because fiat is less volatile than BTC. However, the idea is that BTC will eventually reach an equilibrium based on its supply and demand so that its volatility is reduced to the point where it's viable to price things in BTC.

Okay gotcha. As far as I know, the best 2 options are:
- Bitcoin Mixers - Transfers your coins (along with a bunch of other people's) through a series of wallets before sending it out to the final address of a wallet you create. Technically anyone can look at this and maybe figure it out if they're smart enough (people usually underestimate the amount of effort that's going to be put towards tracking stuff like this if it ever takes off) and you pay a hefty fee to use services like this, but it's an option.
- Monero Intermediary - Buy Monero in one way or another, then use XMR.To. You send them Monero, they exchange it to Bitcoin and send it to your wallet. XMR.To has no idea who sent them Monero, because all Monero transactions are completely anonymous, and they have no idea who owns the Bitcoin wallet they're sending to, because it's a fresh address you just created. Again, you're going to pay a fee for this.

I saw [this thread]( a little while ago that mentions using Revolut to avoid banks blocking your transactions. The poster uses Gdax afterwards, but swapping out Gdax for Quadriga may work. I honestly haven't tried it yet myself, but it seems like a good solution.

- It's not a taxable event in every country. Definitely is in the US though.
- It can still be worthwhile to trade back and forth despite the fact that you're being taxed, depending on how big the swings are.
- USD is actual real-life American Dollars. USDT is Tether, a virtual representation that exchanges use which is (supposedly) back 1:1 with real USD.

I recommend this as well. Allows you to put CAD in as well as take CAD out. Only downside is transfer times, depending on how you're sending the money from your bank.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:28:24
I think the only difference is the way that the exchange decides to handle US dollars. Some use USDT specifically, which means that they've (supposedly) proven that they possess that amount of US dollars and will be able to pay them out to their users. Others use their own custom implementations where they didn't have to go out of their way to get Tether. In either case, you're trusting that whatever exchange you're using will get the USD to you in the end if you really want it.

Hate to break it to you, but if you own crypto on Coinbase, you're already past the point of being anonymous. Coinbase follows KYC, and will disclose information to tax authorities that you purchased X amount of crypto at Y time. What you do with it after that point can be made anonymous, but the cat's already out of the bag.

A cursory look at [this mining calculator]( says that 5 Antminer S9's will give you a profitability of about $16.64 per day, which is right in the range you mentioned. This calculation doesn't take electricity costs into account, and is based on a single mining pool's estimations (NiceHash).
I'd say you're right around what's expected, but the only way to really confirm it is to look at the numbers yourself. Mining pools offer web portals where users can log in and view their mining rates and profitability. If the guy running this for you is an honorable businessman, he'd provide you with the information needed to monitor your own mining equipment online.
