Getting close!

The 10th block was less than 3,000 BTC - it was "only" 2,656.5 Bitcoin, so from that perspective it makes sense to have it at the bottom of the list...

I think the choice of wallets depends on how/where/when you intend to access and use your coins.
Web Wallet vs. Mobile Wallet, etc.
You can of course have more than one wallet...

So... best advice I can give you is that the money that needs to be in the bank tomorrow should be left in the bank.

If you want one that is actually "loaded" with BTC you might want to try EBay (search for "Physical Bitcoin" or "Casascius"). They are quite expensive though...
You could get a collectible coin quite cheaply if you're just after the 
If you want to exchange a small amount of € for Ƀ, the ATM option is probably easiest if there's one in your area.

When the spot price jumped from $440 to $770 within a month, we were looking at a market cap increase of over 500 Million USD.
So if you're correct and we're not talking about institutional buyers or hedge fund managers, do you reckon it was 1-2 dozen (very) wealthy people who have the cash-on-hand to push $10-20 Million each into bitcoin?
Maybe it was 18.5 million people investing $27 each...
