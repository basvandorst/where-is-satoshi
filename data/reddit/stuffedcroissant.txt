And it's far cheaper, faster, more accurate and secure than the centralized alternative. Less friction, lower fees. Crypto gonna be HUGE!

Blockchain without the currency is just a database.

Bitcoin's value can be obtained by calculating its velocity (of money). 
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:47:54
Yes it can.

Didn't that happen in the US around 2007? We citizens paid for the bailouts.

Boy YOU must be fun at parties. Save the "volume" talk for the bitcoin markets sub. This is the bitcoin sub, where a person can bloviate at will.

Bitcoin is either a decentralized, trustless, censorship-proof database that can't be shut down or controlled by the government, or it's a bubble. This debate has been going on for quite some time now.

Good story. Technically, vaginas are far tougher than testicles.

Or 700 percent gain in one year.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:23:05
It could work. Not on you, but it's a numbers game.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:08:01
Honestly if the price holds around this level that's 30 percent gains in a month. Astronomical by any investment standards but not what day traders want to hear I know

The vendors paid fees on those transactions. As much as 4 percent.

Casinos don't allow you to gamble with credit cards. Can't purchase lottery tickets with them either. So seems reasonable the bank would do something similar. As another commenter mentioned it protects them from fraud and from people using credit cards to purchase crypto and in effect get themselves cash for credit without the usual high fees.

Or McAfee Dickcoin?

Did they ban direct transfers to exchanges or just crypto purchases with debit and credit cards?

Not me. I sold all my Apple stock in 2001, when it was clear that company wasn't going anywhere! I refused to believe the hype about Steve Jobs or this upcoming gadget called an iPod!
