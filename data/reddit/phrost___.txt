Low HOA fees for this highly desirable lake front Estate community. This is the last buildable as well as cleared homesite in Hidden Cove Estates and within a 3 mile radius in east Orlando. The site sits on a .27 acre of land and is a corner lot located in a cul-de-sac. This is an oversized lot and is one of the best homesites to build on outside of a lake front lot and it's not in a flood zone. The homesite sits adjacent to lake front homes and is directly across the street from an active $1.28 mil lake front home for sale. Please inquire about the build out specs. A two story build will have a lake view from the second story. The community is located only 15 minutes from the Orlando Airport, Lake Nona, and Winter Park, Park Ave and is zoned for A rated schools in Winter Park. One of the best locations to be in Central FL and just minutes from UCF and Rollins College. Build your brand new custom home to your specs! Seller is also willing to accept sale using bitcoin currency. Please inquire.

This CSW jerk dumped everything to fund BCH and BSV scams. He has nothing more than a couple of units nowadays. He is a idiot with high time preference bias.

Ok, but let's suppose that I reset it by typing 3 times wrong the pin code. How Can I make sure that when I log in to Ledger Live App they are not updating my new passphrase as well? All the management are through their own plataform/software. They also can fake this new wallet generation by make you think that's it's random. IS there any way to check the date that the wallet was generated? I think yes. I doubt a lot about ledger as they are in Digital Currency Group. I almost die to update my firmware as I don't access ledger since 2016. Was hard, shady and I got a lots of bugs.

That’s why I’m asking how does it work. I bought plenty of properties with fiat using closing agents but Bitcoin I don’t know how it can work. Any title company accept this method? Weird. But I know that people have already done it in Jacksonville and Texas. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:26:48
Lol. Central Florida might be. Yellowstone coming I think would be most harmful threat. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:25:23
But has utility and respect supply/demand law for pricing. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:25:06
Do you know any closing agent company that might do it?

Why does people still like gold?   
\- Centralized: USA has alone &gt;50% of gold supply;  
\- USA is the 4th biggest miner(issuance);  
(supply control)  
\- United States controls and issues the USD, most liquid global currency and global unit of account of Gold pricing.  
.:. Gold = Better USD but it's liquidity is USD.   
Gold == USD

Really like the conclusion.   
Don't buy the asset that crashes to the upside.
