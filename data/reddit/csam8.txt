You have no proof of presenting the idea. The onus lies on you to provide documented proof. You’re stating that all documents could easily have been forged and state that multiple people are involved in a cover up at Twitter and the registry which is just here say. Silk Road, Atlantis, Project Black Flag were all shut down in 2013 so there have been many years to come forward. You’re  a shill and troll spreading disinformation.

In the last 30 days btc increased from $3500 to $8000. It has had a slight correction and is currently trading sideways. Throughout btc’s history it has repeated similar patterns in regards to bear markets.
