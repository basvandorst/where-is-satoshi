I love this chick and did not notice until I went to the dogecoin subreddit that dogecoin was put in the cerdits. LOL. More people need to make videos for bitcoin to make it more assesibale to people.

Yes it is legal in the State of Nevada for him to receive Bitcon.  Contributions are define as the following in Nevada:
“Contribution” means a gift, loan, conveyance,
deposit, payment, transfer of distribution
of money or of anything of value other than
the services of a volunteer. (NRS 294A.007) 
Since Bitcoin is define as property by the IRS and property is something of value then yes he can receive Bitcoin from people.

Yes an app that was independent of iTunes would potential get cream. But I believe if the content was there and may need to be niche focus it would be a great thing for the bitcoin ecosystem and for musicians. They are already two bitcoin music projects peertracks which is not out yet and Bittunes which is on the android (beta) right now. 
Waiting for a centralize system while it would be great if apple were to accept bitcoin would be nice but kind of contrary to the whole purpose/ethos of development of bitcoin.
I believe that there is enough room in the music space for such a system to exist but also be a major force in the music industry.

True. Just like when people make imaginative leaps and I want to watch them do the leap but more importantly cheer them on as they're making that leap.

The point he makes in this video about the existing patent is not discuss enough and how it is truly impeding the growth of creativity, the spurring of inventions,and economy needs to be address. More importantly change for the better.
