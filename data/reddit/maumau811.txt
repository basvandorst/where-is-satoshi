sorry do you mind explaining what you mean? are you saying the mining will be less efficient?

very valid point - thanks.
at the same time, isnt the network currently being spammed intentionally to drive the fees up? Is that spam attributed to the miners themselves who are spamming it and forcing people to pay more in fees? The revenue from the fees will easily outpace what they pay to spam the transactions.
In your email, is it any different from me logging into my bank account and sending $0.01 transfers to my other account and clogging up the bank network. 
Any way that people who are running the nodes can invalidate any wallet that is performing these attacks?

After 2 halvings, fees will be higher than actual block prize.
Wait - how are people ok with this??? if we are complaining about fees now, how is this going to be accepteD?

they can check your balance and see who you transacted before.
first thing comes to mind is whether you have a lot of BTC in your account and might just come rob you for it :)

"The problem, however, was how to use it. I tried a few times, but it didn't work out.. So I just threw it away and forgot."
who spends money on a ledger and then throws it out.

you have a way to replenish it back without her knowing? and I dont mean going out and borrowing a loan....ie side income you can scrape out here and there until you build it back.

I would love to spread the word about bitcoin. For some people they dont have the time and want 1,2,3, ok I'm jumping on the bandwagon.
It would be great if this community can share some examples so that I can put together an informational and easy to understand package that we can use to distribute to all our local communities.

I have account for Bitfinex but unable to transfer USD at this time. Any idea?

sorry about the loss 
a general question from me is how easy is it to hijack the DNS and put up a fake website ? it has happened to trezor  and MEW already. how come big banks dont get attacked like that ?
