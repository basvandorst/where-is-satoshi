Well for starters I would have followed the bylaws and figured out how to hold a new election.
Because, it looks like you forced both Jim and Olivier out of the foundation. Jim went willingly and Olivier didn't.

It's not that simple. I read Jim Harpers post of Olivier's plan that he presented to the board and was stonewalled from day 1 on. The existing board never wanted change and the members choices were put up with up and until the point that it looked like the balance of power was shifting on December 31st and then they were disposed of, shady appointments were made, and the elections were moved out.
It sure does look every bit the banana republic that Olivier caused it of being.
@_date: 2015-12-23 11:09:41
Yes, the board is allowed to do that for the newly created seats, not the ones previously occupied by Jim and Olivier.

So if I'm understanding you correctly then the issue isn't node propogation of unconfirmed transactions but rather incentives behind block propagation amongst miners and pools.
Is there a reason that large miners can only propagate blocks or hash at a given time?
From my armchair it seems that an increase in the speed of block propagation would reduce the number of orphaned blocks in the network and make it possible to collect more fees with less of a possibility that by doing so you would jeopardize the block reward.
Anyway thanks for your answer, I'm still trying to understand how this all works at a technical level so I'm probably just way off in left field.

Ya, its something I ran across yesterday while having a discussion with PeterTodd on another thread about block size.
I'm probably not characterizing his argument correctly but as I understand it, it is a variation of the greedy miner where the miner uses the slow propagation of the P2P network to distribute his block to no more than say 30% of the hashing power on the network. By doing this he slightly reduces his odds of getting orphaned while letting the rest of the network waste their hashes on something that isn't the latest block. Meanwhile, the miner gets longer to mine the next block than any of the competition which gives him an advantage greater than simply his % of hashing power.

That is indeed very interesting. Do you know if the relay network is actually being used by large mining pools and miners?
If so it would certainly fly in the face of some theories floating about involving the incentives miners to slowly propagate blocks.
As far as I can tell there seem to be two camps on this issue.
1. Miners want to propagate their newly found blocks asap to avoid getting them orphaned and losing the block reward.
2. Miners want their blocks to propagate slowly so that their competition is effectively wasting their hashing power, while they try to find a solution to the next block and double their rewards.
My gut reaction is that one in the hand is worth more than two in the field. However, if an alternative network of quick block propagation in between miners exists then it might be possible to look at their decisions and infer conclusions about the actual incentive structure.

If bitcoin is to become a completely neutral technology we need to investigate and test methodologies such as this to allow block size to scale in proportion to transaction volume, transaction fees, and block rewards. There should be no block size limit, let the market determine what is optimal at any given time.
Anything less than a free market for block size will advantage some at the expense of others arbitrarily and reintroduce some of the artificiality we are trying to remove from the monetary system.

Upgrade bitcoin-qt to 0.10 then go delete your databases folder and let armory rebuild the database. I fought this issue yesterday where it connected and showed online but wouldnt show transactions. It was on Ubuntu but I think that process should work with any OS. In the end it worked out for me but took a few hours.

Storage space and bandwidth follow the same general trends in growth as transistors. Because of this many people point to Moore's law as a pretty accurate indicator of the future in terms of bandwidth and storage.
Satoshi actually wrote about this in the [whitepaper.]( (PDF Warning)


generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:10:29
The incentives should be aligned over time to allow for a free market in block sizes. It should be designed to grow in proportion with block rewards, transaction fees and with usage on the network. Ideally, the block size would scale dynamically to allow the network to automatically balance transaction volume with price of transactions in real time. 
We are a long way from that system. Philosophically, I believe that Bitcoin should be neutral. Any arbitrary decision on block size will give advantage to one group over another. What we should be working towards is a programmatic system that balances these variables based on the demands of the network.
That being said, the only way to get there is by experimentation so we can learn how to get there from here. So I voted in favor of Gavin's proposal. Not that it makes any difference. /shrug

I was pointing out that the total size of the Bitcoin blockchain relies on Moores law for the ability of individuals to run full nodes.
If you are right about the impeding end of Moores law we have bigger issues than blocksize.

Excellent post! I have enjoyed learning more about Bitcoin throughout this whole discussion.
If we raise the block size do you have any predictions about average blocksize given current transaction volumes?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:33:54
Yo, PeterTodd, 
I'm interested in your opinion on this. Isn't the peer to peer network part of the problem with block size? Since network propagation is less than optimal it incentivises miners to naturally produce smaller blocks to avoid losing block rewards in case of a fork. Wouldn't monetarily incentivising the nodes to connect to more peers and pass more traffic help reduce the time of transaction propagation and allow for bigger blocks? Maybe I'm missing something here.
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:19:50


No need to be rude. I was pointing out that these predictions are built into the protocol. 
People have been predicting the physical limit of Moore's law for a long time but its an issue we should tackle when it arrives.
