TheLipoFund, thats crazy. I used to play at some home games with that dude back in Tallahassee. Pretty sure he moved to mexico to keep playing online after the shutdown.

I hope this asshole and everyone that helped him make this article gets raped to death. And every one of you dumb fucks that upvoted it are just helping him.

Pokerstars and Full Tilt are basically the same thing now.

am i crazy, or is this an absurd post?

That might be true, I'm just not sure if you've presented the facts you're asking me to face. Drug addicts and pedos use USD too, but I'm going to continue using that as well.

Your title is disingenuous. The article says it is still the most used crypto on the dark web, not that the dark web is where it is most used. It does says that there has been a shift away from using bitcoin, which is actually the opposite of your opinion.

Upvoted for the lulz. This is a crackpot bitcoin article version of "Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?"

I was told about it around 2010-2011 from a guy buying heroin on Silk Road. This guy was such a junky he would fall asleep driving on the interstate (luckily a friend in passenger seat took the wheel until he woke up). I just remember having so little respect for this person, that I basically said "Cool story bro" when he explained it to me. Wish I had bought a few hundred coins, but on the other hand I still don't take financial advice from junkies.

Ive always felt you're *rich* if you have a lot of money and you're *wealthy* if you have a lot of passive income.

This has taken place over 2 weeks, have received no replies to my emails.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:28:53
I wrote them emails both times, neither time have I gotten a response.

Yea its too bad that companies like this are ruining the reputation of bitcoins. It seems like a great idea but it looks like its going to lose the economic war.

If I need to suck supports dick to get whitelisted why did I give them more personal information than I have to give my bank. I will never endorse their site anywhere at this point regardless of any lists they put me on.
