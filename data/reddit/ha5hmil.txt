Okay.. explain like you are five... let me give this a shot. It's wont be 100% accurate as i'm trying to simplify it as much as i can (from what i've understood!)
In this example, let's assume that your public key is a nice small metal safe you make (which has a small hole/slit to put money in, like a piggy bank). And the private key is the actual little physical key you made, which you now keep in your lego darth vader keychain. You've made this safe and key both offline, without connecting to the internet. We also know that only your key can open this safe. 
**How does this analogy work with *receiving* money?**
Now, say your friend Harry owes you $10 and wants to send it through the postman. But the postman is a sketchy guy so you can't trust him. So what you do is give your friend Harry your safe, and you ask him to put the $10 into this small metal box through the slit and then send it to you. Because only you have the key, you know that the postman can't steal it - or anyone else who comes across the box.
**Now you may ask, but what if Harry loses the box? or the postman loses the box? or if Penny owes you money and wants to give you the money at the same time? or if you want to go to the candy store and spend it now, and can't wait till Harry's or Penny's money comes?**
For this, now let's assume this safe is a magical box with your lock. And when you gave Harry the safe, you didn't *actually* give him your safe. Instead you just gave him a magical copy of your safe. So when he puts in the money in it and locked it - the money would magically appear on your safe at home too. and remember only you can open this.  (what about the postman you ask? because we are in this magical world now, we don't even need to postman anymore. which is the best part, because he was sketchy af. but i digress.)
***So, what happens if i lose my safe?***
So this probably answers your original question. Remember that key you made which is in your lego darth vader key ring? You now take this to the wizard-locksmith, and you ask him to make a brand new safe that works with only your key. Once you construct a safe with your key's pattern - it becomes an exact copy of your original safe. When you open it, now you are happy to find you still have all your money in there, because in this magic world - when money put into any of your safe's copies would just stay in there, until you open it with your own key.
I hope you noticed that the key didn't have to leave your lego darth vader keychain. It didn't go to the magical realm like the safe did.
Okay, now to explain what the analogies are in the bitcoin world again








I hope this is not too confusing.

i think you mean *bankers and not bakers ;)
And i know what you mean. I've been using bitcoin since 2012. Never held any, just used them to pay for stuff. Started holding from around 2015/16 when i saw the price going up and was in it for the profits and speculation. I only bothered to read the white paper early last year. Once i REALLY understood what it meant it completely changed my mindset about bitcoin. Yes, i'm still in for profits and all that as well, but now - all i can think about is how f'ing cool this technology is!
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:15:22
Doing my bit here. 
It's finally all synced up and in/out connections all working! I even generated a segwit address and tried sending a small amount to it. 
i've heard that you can link up other mobile wallets and stuff to work with your node. i have no clue about it, does anyone know? what else can you do with your node - apart from keeping it running to help the network?
edit - transaction fee was about a dollar and was segwit to segwit for anyone interested.

okay okay i yield! 
i thought it was an interesting point to me, personally. In hindsight, it didn't seem relevant to the main point - the point that newbs should try and read the whitepaper if they haven't, and that such a great innovation has been invented!
plus - as many have pointed out here - that bit was just about block headers. and probably has nothing to do with the current debate on blocksize.

Andreas talks about it in one of his speeches where he says - for his Mum to send her first email they had to first invent WiFi and then the iPad, so she can just “swipe” to send an email. 
For bitcoin I wonder what similar inventions would be made in the next couple of decades or so. You can already see glimmers of it in the form of hardware wallets and slowly improving UI and UX in app wallets. But I feel like there’s way more to come and we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. With LN, RSK smart contracts etc, being developed.. it’s damn exciting!! 
Fuck. I can’t wait to see how bitcoin changes the world. This alone gives me hope to stay alive... just to witness it happen someday!

@_date: 2018-01-03 16:25:06
All fair questions, which i believe the rest of the community can chime in to answer as well. I'll have a go:
1) As far as i know Bitcoin has never been hacked. Yes, the exhanges did - which are a centralised point. Bitcoin by definition is to not be one single point of centralisation - which can be open to attacks.
2) Yes, i think you've answered the question yourself here.
3) Yes - exchanges are needed to convert your Fiat currency to bitcoin. But they are companies by themselves, and i don't think Bitcoin or the Bitcoin protocol can claim any responsibility to keep exchanges secure. That's not what it promises, or the even the purpose of bitcoin. There are alternative exchanges that are decentralised (bisq) or in-person exchanges (localbitcoins) which can mitigate the issue.
And to your last points - i dont know if he knew exchanges like we do have now would exist or needed to exist. Bitcoin and the world of cryptocurrencies have come a long way since inception. Bitcoin itself has had it's fair share of issues, and the developers and the community actively help make it better and innovate and find solutions on top of it to make it stronger.
Satoshi's invention is the Bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin coin. In his paper he only promises the security of just those things. People see value in those things alone, hence why it has a large dollar value next to it. I don't see how it could be negligent, seeing that it would be impossible to predict how things would happen.
I hope that helps answer your questions. (I tried!)

Derren Brown (the british magician/mentalist) teaches an excellent way similar to memorise the words in his book (and audio book) Tricks of the Mind. 
Similar to your method, instead you sort of link each word with the next one. (Sort of like how the hashes in a blockchain is linked to the earlier block. lol)
So using your example seed words:
1. degree --&gt; trash: After being in so much student loan debt and getting that bloody ***'degree'*** certificate, because of crypto i don't need a job, so i threw it into the ***'trash'*** can. 
2. trash --&gt; swap: Because i'm a crypto millionaire now, took that cheap ass ***'trash'*** can and ***'swap'*** it to one made in gold and diamond studs.
3. swap --&gt; gloves: Now when i dispose the trash i just ***'swap'*** the whole can for a new one wearing michael jackson bling ***'gloves'***.
4. gloves --&gt; stone: I also use these bling ***'gloves'*** to sort out my ***'stone'*** collection, which by the way are all the rarest diamonds i've acquired from my crypto wealth.
etc etc...
Then there's another method which he talks about called the Memory Palace (we see this is the TV show from BBC, Sherlock as well).
For this, we simply imagine a place we know very well. Maybe it's our childhood home. We then map a route around this home which we can remember to take all the time. For example, from the front door-&gt;living room-&gt;kitchen-&gt;dining room-&gt;toilet-&gt;bed. And then we would 'place' the physical thing that represents the word in these places in order, or do the actions the word means with something that's always there in that place.
So the memory palace for the first four words in this example: 


I hope this helps someone. :)

Yeah, you can run in prune mode which reduces it to like 5GB. i'm no expert in this, but i think yes it does help in someway - however new nodes will not be able to download the complete history of the blockchain off of you. (sort of works like torrenting peer-to-peer.. i think)

I’m happy to report that I have successfully figured out to do a port forward WITHOUT having to do a port forward with my router (turns out with my ISP it’s not straightforward. However I’ve got unlimited data so can’t complain too much). I’ve been using PIA VPN, but since I’ve found out some questionable people who also back bcash are on the board of PIA. So I was trialing TorGuard VPN and found out you can just portfoward through their client settings. And guess what! I’M RUNNING A FULL NODE BITCHES!

I think he (she?) is was probably saying about email when it was new in he 90s it took ages to send it across the network. It even took longer to figure out how to send an email. But now 20+ years later you can just tap and swipe and send from your phone like it’s nothing. 
This kind of thing could theoretically happen for bitcoin. Or may be bitcoin may not survive and another crypto currency takes the lead. Who knows! But the point is that with Blockchain we are at such an early stages that transaction times and high fees could be expected to be reduced/fixed eventually. (Like with LN perhaps).

Yeah. You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin. 
You are not the only one. There are loads of new people getting into it who don’t realise that they don’t have to buy a WHOLE bit coin. All you have is $10? Cool - you get 0.000597 in BTC. you can do this in Coinbase right now! (Buy in small fraction, or sell in small fraction.)
Coinbase is an easy entry point for newbies, however they seem to be overloaded and may take time to get ID verified and registered. There are hundreds of other ways to get your hands on some bitcoin fractions! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:20:50
yeah i'm starting to gather that. which is why i want to find out stuff for and against. a lot of the stuff seems to be biased for or against - which is fine. i just want to make up my mind for myself by first educating myself.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:10:42
What was the debate? what did i miss?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:08:29
from what i understood it's trying to find a SHA256 string of number that begins with something like 17 zeros at the begining. Eg: 0000000000000000057fcc708cf0130d95e27c5819203e9f967ac56e4df598ee
Basically, the block that get mines contain some hundreds of transactions that get selected to be added from the last 10 minutes. All the details in this transactions need to get jumbled into this super secure SHA256 algorithm. Usually it's a mess of numbers and letter like (B94D27B9934D3E08A52E52D7DA7DABFAC484EFE37A5380EE9088F7ACE2EFCDE9). But in Bitcoin, a difficulty setting is added by asking it find the SHA256 that begins with a certain number of zeros. which is super difficult and takes a lot of computing power. The first miner that find this gets the lucky chance to add that block to the blockchain, and gets rewarded for the hardwork. Every other miner and node then takes that SHA256 number and can verify with the data that's in the block to see if it's correct, and confirm it. (this is what makes bitcoin secure)
I hope this made any sense, and was the question you were asking.
