OK, this is a message by the person who sent all the messages.
The reason I started sending these messages is mainly because I believe in Ethereum long term. For a long time I tried discussing with people on ways to improve bitcoin, but anything that doubts the status quo is immidiately downvoted or censored.
When I found out about Ethereum I was amazed that most of the ideas I though of before were actually already implemented in it. So I wondered why I never read about it in the common information channels.
Then I realized, the censorship in is much more deep-rooted than just theymos, it is actually most of the community. So many of the participants really want the value of bitcoin to go up and get rich quick that they are incentiviced to downvote anyone who doubts the current decisions of the status quo.
Then I realized I can easily by-pass the censorship by sending private messages, there is nothing the status quo can do about that. All I want to do it try to inspire people like me to find the information they need to make a rational informed decision.
upvote or downvote this post?
Be honest to yourself, don't downvote because you don't like a person. You might not like the messages, but anyone visiting this topic will probably like to read this message. You should ask yourself the question: what would someone visiting this topic want to read? Is it the reason behind all this? It probably is.
Ps: No need to complain at the admins or mods. It cannot be stopped until I am satisfied that people are informed. I have decades of experience managing online communities, I know all the tricks of the game
