There's actually [lots of ways]( including paypal &amp; credit card.

I'm no expert but you can do this on BTC-e with what seems to me like low fees (note: this is the only exchange I've used). There's a selection of currencies you can trade &amp; as a beginner, I found it easier day-trading with those other currencies than bitcoin. Bitcoin is just always goin' up, man. Sucks huh. For the most part, I run with litecoin (LTC) for trading because it has it's ups and downs. BTC is more of a buy-and-hold thing for me.

As well as experiencing the same issues as you, I lost coins in two failed electrum transactions. Thankfully very small amounts. I considered it a cheap price to pay to learn that electrum is buggy as hell.

I had the same thing happen. Many did, sadly:
I will never use them again. Luckily I didn't lose anywhere remotely near as much as you. Sorry to hear that.

Credit card --&gt; via Liqpay ---&gt; to btc-e.com ----&gt; buy bitcoins. 
1.2% total fees to do that. Then IIRC it's a flat 0.01btc fee to send your new coins from btc-e to your own wallet.

It's the only exchange I use. I certainly hold them in higher repute than, say, Gox - I would never hand over that much identification to a bitcoin exchange by choice. 
I've had no issues whatsoever.

Feel free to PM me when this gets kicking. I bought my first domain yesterday &amp; paid with litecoins so my suggestion is to also include an ltc interface if that's doable. It was a super pleasant experience, unlike the nightmare of trying to buy one with btc.

BTC-e was flashing red lights (falls) for all crypto pairs while the drama was happening. Litecoin users were very affected.

btc-e has been having issues for a couple of days  - I'm letting it get back to normal before I deposit anything (I can't even get to the Finances page at the moment and the site in general times out often).
