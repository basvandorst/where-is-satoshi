Margin trading was created for the rich to accumulate more wealth because it allows the low/middle class to participate even with a small account but comes with a lot more risk. That is why they tell you, a small fish, to only invest on what you can afford to lose because the outcome is already known. 90% of the traders will lose againts the whales, who can afford to lose a fish's entire investment. So just spot buy and hold your coins and hope for the 100-1000% returns.

Scammers are trying everything. I feel bad for the victims.
@_date: 2018-08-31 05:05:39
This is great. Track the criminals and inform everyone that anything sourced from their address are stolen bitcoins.

Is that in megabits or megabytes? I remember it would take 10-15 minutes to download a 4MB mp3 file via 56k dialup connection.
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:25:59
Be careful.. high chance this is a scam.
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:43:04
More centralized crypto exchanges, great for mass adoption.

All a merchant need is a computer, internet and bitcoin wallet. No need for middle man or centralized Pos system that charge per use. Just bring your phone and transact with the merchant directly. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:16:28
You solved it. LOL

Bitcoin came out first before any other Blockchain. BCH is a partial copy or fork of Bitcoin but with its own Blockchain network, mining farms and with a larger block size. What makes them both decentralized is their number of nodes(computers) that make up their network, which are scattered across the globe. BCH has 1,500+ nodes and Bitcoin has 9,000+ nodes.

Well, credit cards required terminals or POS systems to use, which are physical objects that cost money to manufacture. On the other hand, Bitcoin/Blockchain/DLT is software and easily programmed onto any existing computer devices. Mass adoption can happen at any moment.

Sometimes we gotta learn the hard way. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 15:52:32
hiddentrader, is probably the scammer behind this. lol
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:31:36
Facebook probably bought in and now the FB users will buy in after. Manipulation!

Nothing left for uncle sam?

Just trading Fiat for Crypto. The price of crypto goes up and down because of supply and demand. I can setup my own exchange to sell 1 Bitcoin for fiat at the current rate. You can trade for a whole bitcoin or a fraction of it or satoshis. Then I can use that fiat for regular things or trade it for an altcoin.

Closed source?

"The recently launched Coinbase Card for example, is only available to UK citizens."

First step to cryptocurrency mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:52:40
Replace all middle man.

You can always buy your dog back for double yhe price.. Lol
@_date: 2019-02-21 22:00:29
Mining in the background? Makes sense.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:32:10
Too much manipulation going on. It is best to just own the coin and hold.
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:49:56
Yea fiat needs to be tracked for Gorvernment purposes, hence KYC is required. No way around this unless your income is in cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:48:14
Lol everyone has the same TA patterns.. If I was a whale I would just go the opposite.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:18:52
You might have triggered the next bull run. 
@_date: 2019-09-01 20:29:19
No worries, Bitcoin has already established itself as the "store of value", a gateway to altcoins and supported by all cryptocurrency exchanges around the world.
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:11:18
Nice website... no introduction video with the team?
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:56:01
We pay banks to keep our funds safe.
@_date: 2018-11-08 01:01:13
We need to pay taxes, so the government can built roads to drive our lambos soon.
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:43:00
You need to be verified so you can be tracked to pay uncle Sam.
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:41:12
We need a decentralized web search engine.

2nd layer solution to fix scaling on top of a blockchain that that cannot scale.. Hmm good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:31:30
They were probably waiting for the bear market to be over. Now is a perfect time to announce it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:43:02
So only brag about your profits after you cash out in fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:43:25
Switch to DAG.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:11:13
Yes, bring this news to the whole world.
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:02:39
What? What is that thing?
