And, Travis Skweres of CoinMKT having the same office address as Edison Muckers, thus perpetuating the theme.

Glenn Beck is a bit too alarmist and a bit of a conspiracy theorist but I am really glad to see him talking about this. He has a hard core following that hang on every word.

I think we need to change Bitcoin's algo to MD5. It would be much better for mining...

Add Bittrex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, and BTC-e.
Also when do you think you can get integrated trading added to the app? That will be a huge improvement. 
And lastly maybe offer a Pro version with no ads for like $0.99

No, I'm not missing that. I know that CoinValidation can be done by anyone, and I know the Foundation isn't doing anything, and that's exactly the problem.
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:30:59
I'm not saying there's a conspiracy for the Foundation to work with regulators. I'm saying they shouldn't be discussing things the regulators are going to ask. They should be discussing things we're going to ask. And what we're asking is, how can we stop things like CoinValidation from existing? And instead what I'm seeing is them discussing whether CoinValidation has any merits. I don't care if it has any merits. It shouldn't be part of the debate. Some have said this same thing in those documents.

a few weeks ago I read about a Dutch city where a whole street of vendors introduced BTC payment option.
Anyone knows if this was in Amsterdam or in another Dutch town?
