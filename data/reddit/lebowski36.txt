I was curious myself... just vaguely remembered importing an electrum seed somewhere else :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:30:52
you can probably just compile it yourself for ARM
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:15:36
ps2h and bech32 addresses decrease the tx size and therefore increase the tx troughput ;)
we only need that damn adoption from wallet/exchange/etc. delevopers

i never lost bitcoin but i got an old litecoin wallet.dat and i cant remember how many litecoin i had back then and tried alot of password combinations, nothing worked...
I still got the file and I think my password was really week, is there a tool to bruteforce litecoin/bitcoin wallets? :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:29:00
that is right and im just talking about noobs using hardware wallets and therefore not "expose" their keys when doing normal btc tx.
for now you would need to run a node and have a bit more expertise to do it save.
in the long run even noobs will be able to use LN by outsourcing their LN-Channel observation to watchguards (?) afaik
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:13:55
mobile wallet wont work afaik...
you probably have to run a full bitcoin and lnd node
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:19:06
i still buy my stuff online with bitcoin use segwit and you got way lower fees
i dont mind paying 5$ fee for 100$ steam credit, especially considering the lower price i bought the btc at ;)
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:42:07
I wouldn't trust that either xD
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:18:59
the tx got confirmed by slushpool 
I feel like they prioritize segwit transactions :D
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:19:51
if you want to run a lightning node you have to "expose" your private keys sometime
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:22:53
me neither... is there no way to restore it on another wallet?
kinda like a work around :)

I got the same problem on win 10, is it the same "bug"?
EDIT: Its already stuck for half an hour but its an old 2-core PC so....
@_date: 2018-10-27 11:14:27
Niiiiiiice :D
I hope Room77 will add a btc-atm asap ��

there are already less than 21 million possible mined coins. i once read an article about miners not taking the full 50 bitcoin reward instead only 49.9 which is no problem with the consensus rules. 
Therefore we will never possibly reach 21 million coins ;)
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:48:49
you are right there will never be mined 21 million coins. for that every coinbase transaction would have to be the whole amount. but there were miners who didnt take the whole 50 bitcoin reward instead only 49.9 btc.
so there is at least 0.1 bitcoin missing
@_date: 2018-11-07 16:46:38
Unfortunately it's probably not over...
At least the statistics say. :p
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:51:28
That was who I was thinking about xD
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:29:14
true... only because the market cap shows a specific amount theres no garanty that anybody can take out those huge amounts into fiat
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:26:46
hey ry
you can check the mempool size on this website ;)
the fees are down to insanly low values its strange that nobody really seems to care about. when the blocks where full everybody was crying xD
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:09:14
Probably not over
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:15:21
Some node still got the transaction in the mempool and just your spv wallet node did not and therefore you didn't saw the tx ;)
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:54:58
All my several months old 1 sat/byte transaction went through the last week
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:18:49
have to get a dog pic 
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:25:49
The first thing I did after purchasing my first 1 btc in 2012 was buying something with it :P

You see merchants actually accepting Bitcoin even with high volatility in the markets
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:04:55
Credits to acinq the eclair wallet developers, as well as bitrefill for providing a lightning node.
Special thanks to the core dev's making this possible.

Bitrefill in my eyes is a sane company and they started accepting lightning payments ;\)
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:52:01
So the volatility is not that big of an issue
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:26:45
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:31:07
I just used bitcoin for payment today :)
Ordered a pizza on lieferando.de a German delivery service accepting bitcoin.
So about once a week I use BTC and now with bitrefill I even use the lightning network ;)
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:02:35
It is
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:15:36
Oh then it was 2013 the price was rising to about 200€
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:23:54
He never said it will happen he just said the probability is very high for a long bearish market.
Furthermore he said if bitcoin will hold above 8000 the next days it is a bullish signal against a lot of bearish signals and therefore it's possible the price will go up.

I just read a lot about BitConnect now and would not recommend to give them Bitcoin.
[This article]( and its comment section just convinced me that this is unfortunately a scam.
The shady veil they hung infront of the lending is the big problem about exposing the scam.
1. You get Bitcoin and send it to their site.
2. You exchange these Bitcoins to BCC tokens.
3. You lock them up for min. 120 days.
4. You now got no more value in Crypto but in "USD".
5. You get your profits and your intitial return back in BCC (?)
If I am right in the assumption than you will loose or the system will break with the fall of the price of BCC. 
As long as the BCC token is rising in price they can payout those rates which are bound to dollar not BCC. So if you are in BCC lending you wont get anything for BCC token going to the moon... 
But if it gets dumped I would like to see the look on the faces of the investors trying to get BTC for BCC.
Correct me if im wrong.
