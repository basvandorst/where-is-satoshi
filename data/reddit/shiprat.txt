I’m fairly certain this has nothing at all to do with crypto and is just a way for Sweden to modernize their economic system.  Kinda pointless to get mad about- they are just doing their own thing.

No of course not, and i plan to get a pixel at next cycle to run copperhead since my current devices arent supported, but i am resigned to the fact that ill need to keep another device around since even just paying taxes or bills becomes a hassle otherwise. 
My economy is split in the same way- I have crypto and I have my regular economy, I'm not able or willing to choose just one.

A lot of hostile replies here...  I don’t get the feeling from the article that they intended to say that they “own” block chain in any way. 
It’s important to note that if Bank of America is to implement block chain into their systems they would need to patent their implementations first, not to own the tech, but to own their implementation. Otherwise, if another bank or company uses a similar implementation and patents it, Bank of America could get in trouble.

Clearly it’s quite weird of Xapo to require access to an android or iOS device to get your currency out, but I can’t help but feel like half of the issue here is the authors own habits. 
Copperhead OS is great but if I “refuse to run non-free code on my phone” many things on the society I live would be a major hassle to access.  
The whole wavecrest thing is a headache though. Cryptopay are not as difficult as xapo sounds but still waiting for wavecrest to send my card balance back to somewhere where I can use it.

Also, from what I can see the author of this article has only been with wired for six months, and so I'm guessing wasn't part of the original events. The article is written around quotes of those who were originally involved \(Mcmillan, author of original article doesn't work at wired anymore, he works at WSJ\), but it still seems super weird to rewrite the narrative like this\- If they wanted to supply more information on their "true" reasons for deleting the keys, I feel they should at least get a statement from Mcmillan. 
It reads a lot like they're trying to put a positive spin on something that in hindsight looks stupid.  And they shouldn't need to\- any number of people made the mistake of losing or deleting their bitcoin.

Yes, although Bitcoin Core (the wallet/node software developed as open source) is both wallet and node.  
Before electrum and other wallets that keep the blockchain for you letting you use just your private key and adress to manage your wallet, running a full node for your wallet was the way you did it. 
It still is a very secure way of doing it.
Also, to run a lightning node you need either a full node of your own, or you need to connect to someones elses full node, i forget exactly how that works. Either way a lightning node is an extra piece of software that runs together with an already existing full node.

If bitcoin gets to that point I don't think it will rise again.
Bitcoin has its name and its established value that holds it up, but being stuck with ever more centralized and large ASIC-mining operations makes it vulnerable. If it falls to 1000$ a number of very large miners would be making heavy losses, and I don't even know how they would act to change that. I think the answer is simply they won't let it happen, or will only let it happen as a part of a plan they devised themselves. If you really wanna know whether bitcoins gonna crash that far, keep an eye on any coins using same algo (bitcoin cash i think being the most prominent) and see if the hashrate seems to start shifting over.
If against all odds bitcoin did fall that low, I think it's likely that altcoins would rise and fill the space. 
If you really wait until 999$ tho, I think you simply will keep waiting and miss the train. That's fine too, most of users must come when the tech is fully adopted, not everyone needs to be invested.

That requires trust, do you trust everyone in the world to not lie, and do you feel you can memorize all adresses well enough to be sure nobody is lying to you?
The ledger is trustless- all settlement makes it in and as long as you have a couple of full nodes running you can always know what coins went where. LN is trust-based to a degree and as such it is less secure, it just facilitates a major need; fast, small transactions. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:12:04
Allright, TIL :P

Hmm, guess I need to find some time to read up more on the steps a LN node goes through.

Correct me if I'm wrong anyone. 
Assuming you're referring to bitcoin nodes and Lightning network channels- 
A bitcoin node (usually referred to as full node) is sort of like a server you are running where you have already downloaded the full blockchain, as in every single block containing transactions since bitcoin started and checked it's integrity agaisnt multiple other nodes. Thus you have a complete copy of Bitcoins history, and each time miners generate a new block of transactions and wallet balances change, your node and everyone elses add that new block. If someone tries to "cheat" and spend bitcoin that they don't have, a check will be done against nodes to see whether that address has any bitcoin or not. 
Lightning network channels- 
These are used to perform transactions off-chain. Meaning if you don't want to wait for the next block time (up to 10min) or longer for lowest fees, or if you plan to do many small transactions and so don't want to pay fees for each, you can connect to a network of lightning nodes that lets you instantly send or receive bitcoins- when one of you closes the channel, a balance change is commited to the bitcoin blockchain as a transaction. If all nodes have 2+ channels open and avoid centralizing around specific nodes, you should be able to transact instantly to anyone on the lightning network by going from peer to peer, alternatviely you can connect a channel directly and do it manually. 
Lightning network greatly offloads the bitcoin blockchain by reducing amount of transactions on the chain while still allowing a growing adoption and faster transaction-time.

All good advice. Obviously not all users aren't technical enough to run hyperv's and stuff (although it really isn't very hard) but is still good advice. Another good idea is simply to access wallets and exchanges through a machine you don't typically surf on. I think it might be more approachable for most to isolate the stuff that needs to be secure than to isolate their web-browsing.
But also, write your passwords down on a physical paper rather than use password managers, update your electrum wallets, etc.

Absolutely, I don’t like it either, and I make a point to avoid things that are marketed in such a way and have no interest in people who do the whole sensationalist thing. I feel like something that should have been concluded with “Meh, seems dishonest, probably avoid this.”  Instead became inflated and toxic and spawned articles like this.

This person might be from an alternate universe where bitcoin is an altcoin and.... you can’t... cant buy for fiat? Wait how.... I dunno.  This person might be a bot from r/subredditsimulator

They still don't have their new card up and running from what i know- nobody has (as far as i know) besides maybe tenX or Centracard, and in those cases there is a long wait and for Centra a buy-in amount as well. 
I'll just wait for cryptopay to get their new card out, can't beat amazing customer service, and old card worked great until visa shut it down.

Setting up a main public figure for a project who might not neccessarily have made the entire product is very common. I don't understand this backlash- are people really so naive to think this is unusual or do people just get extra angry since they used the "I'm only 16 and made an app" thing? Pretty sure original post didn't mention she was a girl btw- the one I read didn't. 
From what I understand another person wrote much of the code and at the very least, error checked and then made the commits to github, but it sounds like they were in most ways a team, and I would guess they figured it would sell better if she published it. 
That being said, the "expose" done by namc screamed jealousy, the author being condescending as fuck and explaining the difficulty of being a woman in tech whilst actively trying to sabotage another woman in tech. That is just pathetic. 
The "I'm 16 and made an app" headline or whatever it was annoyed me because I hate that kind of marketing, so I ignored it and the app. 
But all this hate, "exposing" and stalking her and the friends she had who made app is ridiculous. This is how business works, I can't believe so many people here don't recognize that for what it is.

Between two lightning nodes you set up a payment channel- when you make a transaction it exists only between the two nodes until one of them shuts down, which is when a balance settlement occurs and the final change is commited to bitcoin blockchain as a transaction- if you send five hundred small transactions between each other and the final balance is You=2btc Them=1btc where it was You=1btc Them=2btc in the beginning, all that happens is a transaction is made from them to you for 1 BTC.
Since it is a network, not just two nodes, it is built so that you can send or receive BTC far beyond the nodes you are directly connected to, the more the merrier. 
I'm not sure about this but the way I see it, optimally the average channels open per node should be 2+

Doesn't really feel any specific way. If I did the same mistake today knowing what I know, it would feel awful. But I was young and literally didn't have enough income to pay for the electricity unless I took profit, and the odds are fairly good that even if I had held until now, the coins would have been lost on some broken/wiped drive as has happened to many others.
Besides, there is still time to profit from crypto by trading/mining, just not suddenly-millionare profits :P 
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:58:41
Yeah I'm back to mining again, making small but steady profits, hoping HODLing will still get me somewhere :P

That resonates with my feeling of Mt.Gox too, I'm pretty sure I had a part of a coin left but was so apathetic to the whole thing after getting out that i didn't bother when the first claims round started. I think there is another one gonna happen though, maybe try my luck then.

I'm really hoping for the sake of those who didn't move out in time that the trustee handling the BTC makes good and reimburses as much as possible.

Still have 50$ in nicehash after their hack as well ^^ 
That I can get out though, just too lazy to redirect miner to my old adress again. 
Nobody ever said crypto was easy.

Yeah that's kinda the way I'm feeling as well, it's a funny feeling looking back but also really happy to have been there so early.

None, unfortunately, was the point of the pic. When prices started falling after the good run to 20+ in 2011 i sold what i had mined.

Heh, not exactly surprised :P
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:55:54
I wish- mined enough to pay back for my mining rig, then when BTC went back down to like 5$ I mined some LTC and finally sold most of the hardware. All I got to show for it was a few LTC :P 
Am super glad I at least know what happened to the crypto I had, have friends who remember only that they had a coin or a few in some wallet that was simply forgotten about and eventually deleted. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 06:24:55
True. It's fine for people to hope for and expect profit when adopting a growing technology, but to fervently spread doom and gloom whenever it fails to meet their expectations is pretty sad.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:05:07
Dooglus is correct, poor wording in their emails. 
I got 198$ out in the end once cash got into my bank account. Sold another 3 coins at 15,5 a bit later after first time Gox got hacked, when they only suspended accounts for a while and didn't lose any money. 
Since it did go down to 6$ and stayed around there for a while, at the time I felt I had gotten out at perfect time :P

Please stop listening to gullible stuff like this. Any soul out there can just get on reddit, enter a sub and state "opinions" when in reality they are just parroting. 
The noise is real and I firmly believe that this misinformation will continue to spread. Anyone who don't care about their money will be the only ones making financial decisions based entirely on something someone said on reddit, and they'll never know whether they failed or succeded out of luck or by listening to the right person. If you're smart and care about your money, make a plan for how much you are willing to invest, your minimum worthwhile ROI, and based on that, find what you want to invest in, be it crypto or something more stable. I'll say this again, just in case: make your own decisions, plain and simple. 
EDIT: I parodied above poster, since they deleted their post I should mention that this post was a parody more than anything else. I stand by forming own opinions and making own decisions tho.
