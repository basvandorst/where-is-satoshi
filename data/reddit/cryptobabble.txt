If it didn't exist, people wouldn't be able to cash out (and people have been) or buy anything with it (and people have been). 
A Ponzi scheme is actually similar to a pyramid scheme. 
Let's say, I'm running a Ponzi scheme (not for real, just for sake of example). 
I go to person A and I say, "hey, I'm a stock broker, give me some money and I'll invest it in this upcoming company for you and you'll get an 80% return on your investment". 
Now, this upcoming company doesn't actually exist but, I need to get person A some kind of money so that he doesn't hunt me down so, I go to person B with the same proposition. Person B gives me some money and I take a portion of that money and give it to person A. 
Basically, what's happening here is, new "investors" are paying the bill for old "investors" and so on down the road. 
Whether or not Bitcoin can be considered a scam of some sort, it can not (by definition) be considered a Ponzi scheme because that is a specific type of scam with a clear legal definition.

So, while I actually like the idea that you're wanting to utilize BTC to solve a problem, I feel like you're thinking about it too hard. 
If I had a pension that was direct deposited to a bank, and I closed that bank account, I'd fill out the appropriate forms with wherever the pension was coming from and give them my new bank information. I don't know about the originating country specifically (because you haven't mentioned) but, there normally isn't anything saying that you can't move to another country. 
If the issue is just that all of the money is already at the bank overseas and there's no more going into it and you just want to move what's in it to a new bank, all of that could be done online as well. 
Just send a payment directly from the originating bank to the new bank using the routing number and account number of the new bank as the destination. 
If you're still looking for a means of doing this specifically with Bitcoin, you will basically just need to connect both bank accounts to an exchange. Buy with the first bank account then "withdraw" to the wallet of the Bitcoin address on the exchange in the US. Then they can withdraw to their US bank.

To put it in simple terms: No matter where you buy a bitcoin, it increases and decreases in value based upon the markets. It's the same as when you buy a classic car, a Mickey Mantle rookie card, a stock, or a house. The value changes. 
I am in the US so, Coinbase is the only pathway I have to converting USD into cryptocurrency. It's been good to me so far.

I used a credit card because coinbase doesn’t allow instant buy with my bank account. Only option for instant buy in was credit. 
I put in only what I can afford to pay off within a month and only what I was willing to lose if everything crashed.
I’ve been investing for 2 months and I’m up 81% but I’ve also been a bit diversified in my portfolio

You’re moving goal posts here. 
Copy paste does not mean you’ve stored anything in plaintext. It means that you have a means of adding it to your clipboard in plaintext. Many applications exist that will store encrypted records that will be added to your clipboard in plaintext if you provide the correct credentials. 
The average user doesn’t know jack about airgapping, faraday cages, and tails. Hell, half the people on reddit ask questions that make me surprised they were even able to turn their computer on by themselves. 
The default behavior of a mobile device is, by far, more secure than the default behavior of the average laptop and, by extension, so too is your bitcoin wallet on your mobile device. 
Nope, not invulnerable, just more secure. 
Yes, you the user still has to make sure that you are practicing safe computing (whether mobile or otherwise), this is a given. 
If your takeaway from any of this is that anyone actually believes that any type of device is impervious, you’re mistaking. Nobody believes that (except maybe my mom).

In theory, yes but you have to factor in fees on the two exchanges, the time it takes for the coin to hit your GDax account from Kraken, and the potential for the value to raise or fall in any instant. Good luck.

You might be right but, I don't know if you are. 
I think most people know that FreedomCoin (the likely name of an US announced blockchain) is not actually Bitcoin or any other coin. There might be some investors who don't know the difference, but I'd say those are mostly investors that likely don't actually have much invested, otherwise, they'd have at least done enough research to know better.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:25:04
Let's assume that you're correct (which I doubt since mobile phone app data is sandboxed). Malware could easily scoop private keys and seeds on laptops. 
Thus, this one item cancels out. The original says "smartphones are more secure than laptops". It does not say "smartphone wallets are more secure than laptop wallets". 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:37:11
"more of it there is, less it's worth". That's part of the logic. The other part is how much people are willing to buy it for, or sell it for. At the end of the day, if there was only 1 Mickey Mantle rookie card in mint condition in the entire world but nobody wanted it, it would be worth nothing. 
In the case of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the value is based on the buy/sell orders (what people are willing to sell for vs what people are willing to buy for).
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:38:51
"there's a bubble"... Please provide some sort of proof that there's a bubble. This is a tired, tired statement that has no evidence at all to back that claim. Naysayers are constantly calling it a bubble because they don't understand anything about crypto or the community using/investing in it. Last I checked, 5 seconds ago, BTC was still above 11.5k and multiple other coins still going pretty strong.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:34:32
I mean, I get that but... Here's an example. 
I have a 1952 Mickey Mantle rookie card worth 500,000 USD today. (I don't but it's my example). 
When the value of the dollar drops, the value of the card, in respect to the USD goes UP. Or, let's put it this way. If the value of US drops by 50%, the value of my card should then be 1,000,000 USD. 
I can only sell my card for USD (being in the US) so, that's my "trading pair". 
In crypto world, this piece of logic is completely missing. If the USD value of Bitcoin drops, that's Bitcoin's problem. That SHOULD mean that I should be able to trade my altcoin for more Bitcoins than I would have been able to before the Bitcoin drop. 
These coupling of coin values is an issue with the logic built into the exchanges and don't actually reflect the way the real world works IMHO.

Best course of action would be to continue to hold it. These types of downward trends are commonplace especially over weekends. It's all good.

smartphones require all app data transport to be encrypted which hinders man in the middle attacks. The only place this isn't true is within the internet browser app. 
Also, most people guard their mobile devices. They keep them in their pocket when not in use, and generally don't get up and leave them on a desk while walking away for an hour at a time. 
Most mobile devices can't be easily booted from external media either (I can get a bootable thumb drive that will mount your laptop hard drive and then copy the contents). 
All sorts of other things but, laptops are pretty vulnerable to attack from multiple angles when left in their default security settings.

Yeah, I've had that feeling before during a downward turn but, I didn't reddit about it. 
These happen all of the time, literally. BTC will likely be somewhere around $20,000 before the year is even out. It will be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:41:50
Should have switched to Geico. But, in all seriousness, It's fine. Everything will, eventually, get back to where it was and move up. We have dips all the time. Just don't panic sell, otherwise you contribute to making the dip even bigger and it takes longer for everything to recover back up.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:47:56
Currently, the going theory in the US is to treat cryptocurrencies as capital gains (so pay taxes on what you pull out as if it were a stock investment). This is what I do but I don't know what other people do. I just prefer not to get arrested so, I'm playing it safe.

"How is this not a Ponzi scheme" 
I think the more important question is, why do people keep using "Ponzi scheme" outside of its definition. 
In order to qualify as a Ponzi scheme, there has to be deception involved wherein you are suckered into investing in a company or thing that doesn't actually exist. Bitcoin actually exists.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:08:06

Not really. The transfer is free but you’re paying a premium on the coin you are purchasing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:44:28
Also this "my coin is better than your coin" crap is getting old. Seriously. I have BTC and BCH (and a few others that I believe in). I've made some decent bank off of it. Shite coin or not, there's value there. If someone wants to pay me $1368 in exchange for shite, I'm going to produce the shite.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:17:44
When the price of a coin rises 20% (for example) so does the price of the portion you own. Your $5.00 tody could be $6 tomorrow. Sure, that doesn't sound like much but, look at the history of Bitcoin. In the past six months it has risen 506% (at the time of this writing). If you had invested $5 then, you'd have $30. Still, not a whole lot but, let's say, every 2 weeks, you put in 10. At the end of 12 months, you would have put in $104. If 6 months later, you see another 506% increase, your $104 investment is now $630.00 (not including what you've actually already made the year before in compounded returns*)
Still doesn't seem like a lot of money sure and, obviously, 506% is not going to always be the case but, if that's what you can afford to invest, do it. You just have to make sure that you're also willing to lose it because, like it or not, we are all in a sense gambling. 
Personally, I don't have a lot of money either but, I put in whatever I can afford to lose. Sometimes that means not seeing a movie I'd like to see or cutting down on vices but, for me it's been worth it.

Well, you could jet over to coinmarketcap.com and just look at the history of BTC in general. lots of ups and downs (with it and every other coin). The exchanges work on speculation.

It's pretty much the goto app and there are reviews in the appstore, however, to answer regarding security concerns. 
You aren't connecting it to your wallets. By hand, you are adding data about currencies and how many of them you have. 
I'm not certain how much of that data is sent to their server but, they won't know what you have, they only know what you say you have :-) 
There is no personally identifying information that is required to use the app.

The google machine is a wonderful source for figuring out "what in the world is a future contract" in general and there are plenty of long and abbreviated versions of it. There are even quite a few youtube videos. Here's a decent written description  
Nobody knows how the price of bitcoin itself will be effected however, the futures market is based on price speculations so, likely the bitcoin's value will follow speculation as people on the exchanges are probably going to react (at least in part) to the futures market. This is just my opinion.

State backed cryptocurrency. I'm having a hard time understanding how Maduro creating its own coin, which you can't buy or trade yet, caused an immediate panic. I'm not being combative, I just don't understand and maybe you (or someone) could help me understand that?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:07:51
Some people will say "HODL" because you don't want to miss out if it explodes upward. Some people will say "re-invest some elsewhere" because if there's a big drop, you'll in essence be starting over. Having your investment in another coin might save you from losing too much and then you can buy back into BTC when it's lower (if it gets lower). 
Personally, I'm HODLing some and investing elsewhere with some just to hedge my bets a little.

What kind of protection does coinbase have -  
Also they have 2 factor auth on transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:43:43
Lots of information on that all over reddit already. 
Edit: The most important thing that you do need to know is that Futures are on their own exchange and do not directly effect the price of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges. They may, however, indirectly effect them as people may trade on the exchanges based on what they see there.

Except that it is. Keylogger logs keys. Do you actually hand type your private key and seed? 
Most people would be copypastaing (but I don’t know for sure because I don’t use mobile wallets). 
You’re making a presupposition here that someone has physical access to your phone: “someone could install on your phone from the appstore” 
In that case, they have to be able to unlock your phone and they’d have to know your AppStore password. That’s a lot of steps there. Alternatively, they could social engineer you into installing those. 
Same exact thing could be said of laptops. 
It is by far easier to infect a laptop with malware or to MITM one than it is a mobile device. 
The statement that the security posture of mobile devices is better than laptops is completely accurate. 
Nobody ever said that mobile devices are invulnerable, they simply said “more secure” which is accurate.

I've actually noticed the altcoin prices shooting up quickly after a drop. Wonder if folks are watching BTC for clues as to when to sell their alts and then buying back in at a low (causing a buy wall). I might actually experiment with that some point just to see.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:16:57
Thanks! I'll look into those. I've heard of Kraken but, I'm already in coinbase (and Gdax), Binance, and Bittrex. Like, how many more exchanges do I need to upload my driver's license to before someone actually steals my identity :-p

Correction: Other cryptos dropped at the same exact time that Bitcoin did. Everything dropped at the same exact time for me, with one exception... an altcoin I have on Binance that dropped a little but not as much as everything else. 
I find it weird that all of my coins dropped in USD value at the same time and to about the same degree. Makes me wonder if all of the exchanges are using Bitcoin's price for their conversions to USD because they really shouldn't. Each crypto should be independent. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:25:36
I’m telling you, there’s a fee for coinbase to PayPal (since you didn’t want to google, I did it for you). The fee is 3.75% 
Then, you said it’s free to deposit from bank to coinbase and I’m telling you that the “free” there is hidden in the premium upcharge of the coin you are purchasing. 
Look at coinbase price of a coin and then look at where that coin is on GDAX. You’re paying more for the coin on coinbase than you would be on GDAX.

If you're worried about the morality of this, the way to go is to use a capture page. You've seen them before I'm sure.

Just put a disclaimer there "by pressing the okay button, you agree to mine bitcoin for 10 seconds before you are connected".

LTC is a source code fork of BTC and it is NOT a runtime fork. 
The comment simply said “fork” without specifying which kind of fork. Why do you automatically assume that the comment was referring to the one kind of fork that made the original comment incorrect instead of the one that made it correct? 
It’s a fork of some kind just like a salad fork and a dinner fork are both forks.
