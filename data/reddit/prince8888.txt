Per capita: prolly netherlands and switzerland
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:06:24
coinmarketcap for example has the linear chart as the standard. Including on the front page on the mini 7days chart.. and you cant change that !  
do you know any website it shows log scale chart as the standard ?

Who is selling ? potentially: people who need cash to pay off debts, traders, miners, people who are using their debit cards, merchants who receive in btc and then sell to fiat.. etc..

I like where this is going

On its way to 75&amp; ?
@_date: 2018-11-10 09:37:52
I think wirex does the job. But i guess when you have btc in your wirex balance and use to pay on fiat, the conversion is not the best. But its all "think" and "guess". But take a look.. could suit you

Where are you putting ?
How you negotiating the location ?
How have you decided on the location ?
How much you paid ?
How much are you expecting to profit ?

If fiat money deposits take so long to get into your account and bitcoin deposits are almost instant... isnt BTC easy to use and fiat money difficult to use ?!
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:31:52
which atm brand you bought ?
are you planning to pay a rent/share profits with the location you are installing ? if so, how much ?
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:09:39
That actually makes good sense. What i dont like about using btc to pay (at the current stage), is that lots of merchants just use a company that accepts btc and converts to fiat immediately. So, in practice, im selling btc and paying in fiat (in terms of liquidating btc - being a taker in the market), even tho im making a btc transfer. Not sure if im being clear...
@_date: 2018-07-04 14:34:33
HOLDling is the easiest, less time consuming and less energy consuming strategy. And its extremely efficient
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:55:19
Set up a bitcoin atm at your place and invite your friends ;)

Not every cryptocurrency is deflationary. So, invest in what you believe.

You know what uses too much energy and is going to worsen climate change ? Soda fridges. And btc is way better for people than sodas :)
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:30:17

@_date: 2018-07-13 15:27:38

People with similar interests, generally, hang out together. Roger Ver and Calvin Ayre got closer when they start advocating for bch. Calvin Ayre doest hang out with Jimmy Song, for example, as their agendas clash. Maybe if they were friends before crypto, they may continue hanging out. But i doubt they will start now
Mike and Roger Ver are starting to hanging out. Will they continue ? Time will tell

Why people are taking this so negatively ?
the only difference between
"excuse me, do you accept bitcoin ?"
and 
"excuse me, do you accept credit card?"
is that bitcoin is better !
he is not saying he will try to convince anyone to accept bitcoin.. he will just ask
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:45:43
Why would i want any solution thats not automatic ? Otherwise i do it myself
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:11:49
