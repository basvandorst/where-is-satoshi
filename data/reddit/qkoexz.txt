To put this chance into perspective, imagine the bitcoin network becomes so large that 1 million transactions happen on it every second. And imagine every single one of these transactions use a new, unique address.
The average time it should take for an address to be reused is 3,382,767,365,233,159,365,090,539 (3.38 septillion) times the age of our universe.

But gambling is good fun for some people. My rule is to set aside an amount of money you are *absolutely* okay with losing, let that be $10, $100, or more. Also make it so that its physically difficult to get to the rest of your money (e.g. leave cash and credit cards at home). That way, gambling can be an affordable pastime instead of a life-crippling addiction.

How would it work if Dodgy Dealer A had a lot of money in one account that he had to move? For example he got paid his salary to Address A. Wouldn't it be suspicious if Address A makes all these small transactions to all different addresses?

Yes but wouldn't that change greatly once the network hashrate increases as a direct result of these miners being available? By the time it's made its original price back, it might not even be worth the electricity that runs it.

Come on, it's basically at a standstill because everyone's waiting for shit to happen on MtGox.

They charge 1.5BTC for a 1BTC coin. $50 for a little metal coin is just too much.

They'll sue the bitcoin network for $140 million.
