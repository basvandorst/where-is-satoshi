I said that I create a new account every year. I feel it improves my privacy.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:30:53
Please explain how my account's age makes any difference. I support Core and SegWit, just don't agree with what's going on on this sub.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:08:35
Do you realize how the quality of your comments has been decreasing since the beginning of our exchange? You're now just resorting to typical dumb one-liners.
BTW, I create a new account every year as I believe it improves my privacy. Despite my account's age my comments bear the same validity as any other.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:05:44
After many months I've finally made my decision of supporting SegWit. I've studied both sides extensively, and this wouldn't be possible without as censors any discussion that doesn't fit their agenda. My only issue right now is the terrible censorship going on this sub. I understand that some filters and rules are needed but right now it's too much.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:56:14
Who says I'm not appreciated? I'm into Bitcoin since 2011, I've made several contributions to the code and I run several businesses related to Bitcoin. I have a right to express my opinions and you're just trying to oppress me just because you don't agree. I am fighting for an uncensored and free community.
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:32:01
This is my 5th or 6th account. I make a new one every year.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:21:19
BTW, you don't know if it happened to you as you don't get any sort of warning, your comment still shows up to you. The only way to check whether your comment was removed or not is by either having someone comment/vote on it or sign out and check with another account.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:42:54
I think that talking about it (like I'm doing) is more effective than what you propose.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:24:15
I'm running 0.13.1, is there any reason I should always upgrade to the must recent version? I usually only update on every other release unless there's something critical.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:29:33
That's all very pretty but doesn't work when must people aren't aware of what's going on. Right now conversation largely takes place on one place (creating centralization. Given Bitcoin's nature I don't think it's appropriate to have such harsh cens0rship on the main discussion forum.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:03:06
It's not whether he thinks or not, it's just a fact. Even certain words trigger the automod to remove your comment.
@_date: 2017-02-21 11:15:14
I shouldn't bother explaining this since you're so rude but anyway. He's saying SegWit transactions take more space, making the 2MB block hold the same number of transactions as a 1MB block with non-SegWit transactions. I'm not saying this is true as I'm not familiar with this system, just that you quoted him out of context.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:07:09
Were all those images and repetitions supposed to reinforce your comment? Because it didn't. As a matter of fact it made you look terribly immature.

Wouldn't it be safer to have a shorter retargeting period? In case of a hard fork and the mining power divides confirmation times would be affected for a while.

Not true, I live in the EU and there are no data caps, I use on average 700 GB download and 300 GB upload monthly.
Running a full node doesn't need to be for everyone.
At a cap of 300 GB monthly my life quality would suffer quite a bit I most say.

@_date: 2017-04-29 15:44:05
Do full nodes require the signature data to work properly? If a full block is mined containing only SegWit transactions does it mean my full node will download the 1 MB block plus the signature data, to a total of ~3.7 MB, effectively increasing the network traffic? (not saying increased traffic is a problem)

Let's say SegWit is implemented successfully and people start using. If for whatever reason we need to remove SegWit, what happens to the transactions made while SegWit was active? Is this new database lost?
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:43:52

He knows that, he's just being annoying on purpose.
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:58:54
But SegWit already *is* a block size increase increase. Don't you get it? That fact alone makes all this alright because it is *that* good. We don't even need to actually implement it, its mere existence in the form of a BIP is enough for at least the next two decades. It might actually help cure cancer too. Get up to our level fool, we've been playing chess while you've been playing checkers

Your transaction is abnormally large (maybe you can't understand what that means.). You failed to mention that on your initial comment.
What do you propose I do?

@_date: 2017-05-10 16:16:03
Right now I'm too lazy to explain it. But maybe you can tell me the reasons why you don't agree so I can proceed to nitpick it.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:02:39
I like SegWit, I think it's the path forward, but clearly many people don't share the same idea as you and me. What do we do? We can't just repeat the same thing over and over, they already know our side and we know theirs. We must come to a solution that works for the majority.
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:24:37
You're like those rich politicians making laws to "help" the poor. To help the poor you must actually understand their situation, and rich politicians are far from understanding it.
With that said, try actually using Bitcoin or run a business and you'll see how short sighted you're being.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:18:28

@_date: 2017-05-10 15:38:12
We can have different opinions.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:21:54
Yes but unfortunately it's not enough for must people. I run a full node but I don't use it for anything. It's just there consuming energy - which I don't mind. I do it mostly because I'm a geek and it's fun but I imagine it's just an hassle and way too complicated for a normal user. If we want to increase the number of full nodes there has to be some sort of incentive for the average Joe.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:22:52
Bitcoin doesn't have an official use. People choose what they want to do with it. I personally use it as a store of wealth (as you've described) and for small purchases such as VPN subscription, Steam games and other nerd stuff. I want Bitcoin to not only be a store of wealth but also be useful as a currency and I'll keep fighting for that.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:01:27
How is that going to prove anything?
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:41:28
It has nothing to do with cost, it's only related to not gaining anything from it.
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:13:48

@_date: 2017-05-29 22:02:02
Do you really think I'm going to type all that shit? Why don't you just post it here, what are you hiding?
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:55:30
Is it your hobby to just say completely random things? How is that in any way related to what I just said?
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:57:00
Sure, why not? Many of us are nearly all in too. Not me though, I'm not completely utterly retarded just yet. Invest maybe half or 2/3 of it, you're young, take some risk, maybe.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:51:01
Is it possible to push a transaction again after it was dropped from the memory pool?
You send 1 BTC to someone and that person saves your transaction. Then the transaction is removed from the memory pool and you make a second 1 BTC transaction from a different wallet/address and the recipient pushes your old transaction after the 2nd one confirms. Now he has 1 confirmed transaction and one pending that could possibly be confirmed. Does it work like that?
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:12:11
Proof or GTFO.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:11:20
I didn't say they're the majority. Neither side has a majority, only if we come together we'll reach a majority.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:14:36
Yes. They aren't even required to include transactions at all, that's why we see empty blocks.

I didn't say that. I'm in Bitcoin since single digits and I've always said we'd be here one day. I know we'll go much higher than we currently are.

You do realize SegWit increases the block size limit, right? OP will have to close down his full node either way if he's already at maximum capacity.
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:09:02
Only to regret their decision 6 months later and remove it. It is a fact that more and more businesses are moving away from Bitcoin. Unfortunately it seems like Bitcoin isn't going to be used as a currency any time soon.

What the fuck is your point? Your transaction is 10x larger than normal and you only paid 5x the normal fee, what the fuck were you expecting? I'm only asking for the transaction ID so I can see more details you fucking doorknob.

Nah I'm just saying you can't have a discussion without belittling the other party and refrain from using dumb sarcastic memes. Try actually making sense and put some effort into understanding what other people are saying without putting hidden messages or believing everyone has an agenda and/or is plotting to destroy Bitcoin.

Who the hell is talking about 8 MB block limit?
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:36:20
Definitely the latter, but now that you mention it, I think it's possible to get a full node running on a smart watch, even with a larger block size limit. Smart watches, much like most smart phones, are more capable than a Raspberry Pi. They're much more expensive too, and large micro SD cards are very expensive also. Not to mention the insane data plan cost. But possible, I think :)
