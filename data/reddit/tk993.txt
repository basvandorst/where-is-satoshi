Trouble is it's far from local. At least where I am.

I can tell you why: because currencies aren't supposed to move 100% and Bitcoin did. 
Apples and oranges.

He posts that like it’s a good thing. The deal he cited was a deal 10-20% below current listed prices. 
That’s a liquidation sale. It was a firm trying to get out and another firm speculating that they can sell (arbitrage) all the coins above 3,700 to naive buyers on retail brokerages who are still high on hopium.

Because at that point the idea is there will be so many transactions that the transactional volume will incentivize the miners enough to keep mining. 
I.e. now they get the 12.5 (or whatever we’re at) of new coins + a small number of coins from transaction fees. 
The idea is that by the time 2100 rolls around, the transactional fees will be more than enough to compensate miners to bring network security. 
My question is how big the blockchain will be at that point? It will have a record of every transaction ever made. That just seems like a bloated mess to me. It already seems like a bloated mess riddled with a history of scams, Ponzi schemes, and lost wallets. Along with Silk Road, money laundering, shady poker sites, and other illegal transactions.

It's funny. I actually misread the title and assumed OP did make that pun. Only realized he hadn't when I saw your comment.

This exactly. And it’s the reason Bank of America doesn’t want to do business with people in cryptoland. The OP is an unlicensed Money Servicing Business (MSB). BofA can’t do business with him for compliance reasons. But even if he was properly licensed, it’s easier for them just to say ‘no’ than to do the DD and confirm this guy is setup right. 
OP is delusional. But I easier to blame BofA in this echo chamber than to register your bitcoin ATM business properly.

We can be reasonable sure he doesn’t as he pointed out that he registered the business with Michigan (as if that was enough to make it legitimate).

It’s the same thing. Every transaction has a purchase and sale. You’re selling the bitcoin and purchasing a good/service. So bitcoin is only worth what you can sell it for (purchase goods/services/dollars/Europe’s/anything).

Not sure where you are located. Coin base is super easy and quick. But it does link back to you.

Value investors do cheer when price goes down.  The difference is they are purchasing a productive asset at depressed valuation. You are just purchasing a speculative asset at a lower price.
They would love to purchase an asset that earns $1b/year for as low a price as they can get. So they would in fact cheer for price to go lower assuming value remained the same (it still makes $1b/year). 
For a speculative asset like bitcoin, price equals value. It is only worth what you can sell it for; you are buying with the belief that in the future more people will want/use bitcoin. Which should drive price up.

Fair enough. And that’s where you and I differ. I see it more as a commodity. Maybe in the future it can be money, but currently transactions are too slow, often expensive, and not widely accepted.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:53:47
Exactly. We are in denial. 
General sentiment:
“Just dollar cost average. It’ll come back. I’ve been involved in 2-3 bear markets before. Lots of banks and shills bashing bitcoin and shorting. But the tech is great! You’ll just have to be patient for new all time highs. Like 2020.”

Well, I guess we've got it on good authority. You're telling us.

I don't even get this question. Paypal deals with USD which are more stable. Bitcoin is a "currency" that you don't need to use a service like paypal to send money.
That is unless I don't know something about paypal. Paypal is just like an ACH transfer or a wire transfer. It's just another method of transferring USD. 
A better thread would be Paypal vs. Dwolla: Pros/Cons... but that wouldn't belong in the subreddit.
