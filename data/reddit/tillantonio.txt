Good point, I definitely agree with you. This book is also more about the general thinkable trends and scenarios, rather than go to solutions. Until the whole blockchain space matures it’s impossible to make any kind of definite predictions about the future!

I completely agree with you, he’s definitely in the inner circle of potentially and probable candidates for being part of Satoshi!

Well I wrote about it because no matter what your opinion is about the motives behind it, it was an important milestone in the history of digital currencies. Bitcoin was designed as a digital currency and only later did people start to figure out that the underlying technology has a lot of potentially revolutionary applications - and the blockchain hype began!

One might just dress up as the Bitconnect guy for Halloween, run around and scream “bitconneeeeeeeect” :D

“Initially it was a huge problem of figuring out how much a Bitcoin should be worth. The first valuation of a Bitcoin was done by an early user named NewLibertyStandard who came up with a method of determining their value. He used the estimated electricity cost it took him to generate one coin, which put one Bitcoin equal to 0.01$ dollar.
The first use of Bitcoins was on the 22nd of May 2010, when the Hungarian-born software architect Laszlo Hanecz managed to find someone who would buy two pizzas for him in the exchange for the combined price of 10.000 Bitcoins. Ever since then the 22nd of May is celebrated as “Bitcoin Pizza Day”.”

Fascinating fact: Satoshi named Nick Szabo’s Bit Gold an essential influence for Bitcoin!

You’re completely right, as long as the ominous ominous holder of approximately 1 million Bitcoin that we’re mined in the beginning doesn’t suddenly decide to open the flood gates of his wallet, it doesn’t matter ��

You’re right, that’s of course also a viable possibility!

Well, the article is looking at the aspects that led up to the inception of the first blockchain, which was indeed Bitcoin. It’s clear that after that it becomes impossible to use blockchain as a correct and specific terminology, since there are a lot of different approaches and technical variations

Most probably you’re right (since most people who possessed the necessary skill set of mathematics, cryptography and computer science were mostly man), yet I’ll take an agnostic approach to this - we simply don’t know with certainty who’s behind it, so it’s just logical for me to keep it open
