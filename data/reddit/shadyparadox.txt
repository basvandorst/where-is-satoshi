Everything you said is wrong.
It's not clear in the ToS. It's not disproportionately the right. Death threats and calls to dox from the left are less likely to be taken down than learntocode from the right.
Did you not notice all that "dog whistle" and other convenient reinterpretation bs? Of course the right will be guilty more if they're held to a stricter standard, that's the point.
Even a post saying self-coding AI defeats learntocode got the guy suspended. And as for "muh anecdotes," yeah, you kinda have to point out some details on occasion if you want the discussion to have any meaning.
Meanwhile the "dogpiling" on Sandmann didn't result in mass banning the way learntocode and NPC accounts did.
Also GTFO with the balance fallacy, if you're not even going to acknowledge that the left is more likely to claim offense with everything in the first place.
One ideological difference between the left and right is that while the right believes in universal behavioral standards; the left believes in different standards according to perceived privilege and marginalization. So when Twitter leaves up all of Sarah Jeong's anti-white posts but takes down any copies of the post that merely replace "white" with some other identity group, they're implementing a leftist ideological bias.
The entire problem can be summed up as lefties thinking they're objective when they simply interpret everything outside their own camp more harshly.

The aberration itself is noteworthy simply because it's an anomaly. Benford's Law is a pervasive statistical phenomenon. It's not TA.
The skew is *most likely* going to come down at this point as we start to register some days with a 1 in the front. Therefore, this is the optimal time to point it out as this might be the point at which the data is most skewed.
Over time, the data will almost certainly conform to Benford's Law. It could be hitting a wall below $20k, or it could be a 10-year decline to $100. One way or another, eventually we'll look back and see 30% of the days closing with a 1 in the front.

Sounds like you don't know how the system actually works at all.
Income tax doesn't go to anything productive. It's used to pay the interest on the national debt, i.e. money that TPTB have already spent. It wasn't some problem solving thing for the common good. Nothing is.
Once the precedent is put in place that governments can take substantially larger amounts from people, they just find more ways to burn through it even faster. Since the revenue is taken by force, they can anticipate how much they can spend in advance. Since others pay the cost of their folly, there is no accountability.
Anyway, the thing I find ridiculous about the income tax in particular isn't the pragmatic side, which I also think is a farce, but rather the ethics of punishing people for doing well.
As I see it, your income was made by providing a service to others, whether through employment or entrepreneurship. You are only paid because someone valued your work. So you already contributed to society by working; you don't have to contribute again.
Not that you would be anyway. Government isn't society, it's just a scam that paints itself as such.

That's an interesting way to frame the question, because I think the ultimate goal is for it to *replace* your savings.
We live in a Plato's cave of an inflationary world. Inflation is so deeply ingrained in our financial mindset that it's hard to imagine a world in which it doesn't dominate. Sure, everyone always wants their assets to appreciate in any system regardless, but in an inflationary world, it's necessary for survival. So if a new system comes to replace that, do you really need everything to appreciate against it to survive?
The most illustrative example is retirement accounts. Why do people have retirement *investments* like 401k's instead of retirement *savings*? Most of these people have no idea how to trade the stock market, then there's added complications with taxes, fees, etc. The reason they do it is not because they genuinely seek to make money, though that's always nice, but rather because they don't want their retirement to lose value to inflation. That example has the most significant consequences with respect to inflation since retirement is saved for decades, but all investments must beat inflation to be considered good, and their real gain in value is less than it sounds also due to inflation.
Bitcoin's final form is a store of value, making it a new form of savings. While **a store of value is a downgrade from being an investment, it's an upgrade from the current form of savings**, since even the best CD rates that lock the funds away for years often don't beat inflation. This new form of savings will outperform traditional savings (as traditional savings don't store value) and be far simpler than traditional retirement accounts. Imagine bypassing all that 401k nonsense to defeat the artificial problem of inflation when all you have to do is just hold final-form Bitcoin to retain reliable value.
The question of how or why such a transition would happen is a tricky one, because I agree, transitioning from an investment asset to a savings one is a downgrade. As generally long-term bullish as I am on Bitcoin, I suspect it'll be a decade before we get to see how it actually unfolds, but here's my current thoughts on it.
Crypto has always gone through hype cycles, as you know. These hype cycles though are generally not just greater fools chasing gains though; there's always been some new paradigm vision people also seem to be chasing in the process. Remember the "blockchain" boom? For a while, everyone thought blockchains would be everywhere so people invented all kinds of stupid stuff just so they could jam a makeshift blockchain in the middle somewhere to appease giddy investors. Their imaginations were way bigger than reality. Then people realized blockchains are just terribly inefficient databases, and the only space where the additional security is worth it is a decentralized monetary system which we already had. More recently, we had an altcoin hype bubble, where there were all sorts of useless coins massively outperforming Bitcoin and the other major cryptos.
Blockchains and altcoins do have value, but the true discovery of that value occurs well after the hype bubble pops and things level out to an equilibrium.
We haven't had a true "bitcoin is the next store of value" kind of bubble yet. As I said, I'm guessing that's a decade away. I don't remember what it was calculated to be. Depending on how much of the savings/retirement/currency market it would take, it would end up something like $200-500k per coin. That's an unbelievable number to comprehend right now, but Bitcoin maximalists often arrive at much higher numbers, because they suspect it will take over all that and much more.
Take the following numbers merely for the sake of illustration. Let's say the "true" long-term savings value of Bitcoin is $250k/coin. The way I think this would play out is that there would be one last hurrah bubble going way over this, say to $1M, because once again, people's imaginations are way bigger than reality. Then when it comes back down, it will become frustrating, then boring, and never return to the fun glory days of $1M that everyone will reminisce fondly about years later. It will just serve as a dull, but reliable long term store of value, as originally designed. Its widespread availability makes it viable as a currency (assuming second layer solutions for microtransactions continue to improve), and people find it OK to hold onto in the meantime because its value doesn't inflate away. However, maximalists won't see it getting quite as big as they thought, and investors will no longer see it as a viable investment. Therefore, the verdict from maximalists, pundits, trolls, and possibly even this forum will be that Bitcoin has failed.

@_date: 2018-11-20 13:56:25
OK, I'll try.
First of all, you should never focus on the extreme top and bottom points of bull and bear runs, because they are literally the most inaccurate approximations of fair market value anywhere on the timeline.
If we could somehow simultaneously read everyone's minds and wallets and sum them together through some magic formula, we could arrive at a true fair price that is probably different from the price you see most of the time. But since we don't have that, we have to go with the old method of price discovery.  It's a messy mechanism where everyone tries to guess how everyone else will value the asset, while those same people are also trying to guess how everyone else will value it etc. all the way down. So there's always a lag between the current price speculation and the actual fair price. Meanwhile, the fair price is always changing too because people are always changing their opinions.
Bubbles and crashes both happen during times of extreme speculation, in the sense that nobody is actually taking into account their true valuation of the asset. Instead, they simply assume everyone else is buying for whatever reason in the case of bubbles (or selling in the case of crashes), so they do the same to try to catch the wave, furthering the frenzy. So they keep buying until everyone's bought and there are no more buyers (reverse for sellers) and all that's left are people on the other side of the exchange. So they all then compete to get out (or back in) first and the market quickly reverses direction. The exceptional thing about these times is that in no other scenario is one side of the market so exhausted. But it was artificial due to speculation rather than any real valuation.
The point is that $20k never really happened. Besides the fact that only a few meaningless bots exchanged right at the top anyway, the final price explosion from $7k was pure speculation. No one actually thought to themselves, "Yes, this is an appropriate price given this size of the market, I'd be lucky to buy any cheaper than here." They were just going with the herd. But it's important to remember these stampedes occur in both directions; the bottom will be due to just as much reckless, inaccurate speculation as the top.
Unfortunately, you never know a run has gone too far while it's happening. It's obvious $20k was too high too fast looking back now, but the current price is anyone's guess how appropriate it is (because of the lag I mentioned before).
So what will get us ~~back~~ to $20k? More people using it. The true valuation is always proportional to the userbase, and that's what has to go up if you want such a price to be more permanent. People often think it matters what happened to all the people who came and left the last time, but it doesn't. Some people just realize their bad experience before was their own folly, others will be completely new once again. But the fundamental changes do not occur during the market swings, they happen before. And they're gradual too, so you'll have to be patient.
Bitcoin doesn't look viable during a crash, sure, but how will it look once it finds a bottom and holds it for a year? As the halving approaches? Perceptions will change, because human memory gives more weight to recent events than historical ones (this is a rational position). So there would only be a problem if it goes into a death spiral and never stops falling. Some people think this is what's happening, but from what I can tell there definitely is a bottom somewhere, given the technology is fine and there's a devoted userbase that's steadily growing (the quitters by definition weren't devoted, we don't need them). And there had to be a bull run for *some* reason and the userbase is definitely getting larger (just ask around, most people have only been around 1-2 years at the most), so that bottom certainly has to be above $1k at the very worst, probably quite a bit higher than that I'd say.
Again, speculation bubbles are just noise. They oscillate above and below the true value, so don't let the extreme endpoints shape your opinion of the space.

The vision is that Bitcoin will eventually capture a significantly larger share of the currency market than it has right now. All the real benefits of a currency are supposed to happen then.
The gains are only part of the transitional phase in the meantime. No one expects that to last forever.
In the event it does reach such a large market cap, two things will happen. Its potential will decrease (as it's already been realized), and its volatility will decrease (more people in the space). *That's* when the stable store of value attribute kicks in. Furthermore, the lesser potential for gains, relatively stable price, significantly larger number of users, and completion of second layer solutions will lead to an economy where spending is more the norm. That doesn't make as much sense in this stage, however.
The point is not that I guarantee this will happen, though I suspect it will. The point is that it's OK that the intermediate stages look nothing like the final product is designed to be.

Deflation is bad for a debt-based currency, which Bitcoin is not.
"Hoarding" is a pejorative term for saving, and thus is not an argument.
Saving is a sign the currency has value, specifically future value, and does not prevent one from spending it. It emulates a decreasing supply, and thus increases its value. In contrast, more spending is higher velocity, which decreases its value. The argument "it will become so valuable that it will be worthless" is contradictory, and ignores the likely scenario there will actually be an equilibrium point.

I've been in Bitcoin since 2013. I saw the price shoot up from $100 to over $1100 in a few months, then take years to recover.
Honestly, 2018 feels a lot like the bear market of 2014. As everyone says, there's no guarantee patterns continue. But as someone who's weathered the storm before, I do think there's a lot to be learned from the past as well. Instead of getting swallowed up by your own mood swings, pay attention to everyone else's; that might give you some clues as to where we are in the hype cycle.
In the first half of 2014, the price had a lot of volatility, but steadily declined from about $1000 to $600. During this phase, everyone was optimistic this was just another waiting period for the next breakout. The first half of 2018 was very similar; the price moved with volatility but steadily down from $17000 to $9000. Like before, everyone was optimistic this was just a break between price rises.
In the second half of 2014, volatility was lower, but the price eventually broke support at $600 and fell to $400. This is when the trolls started coming out of the woodwork proclaiming crypto is dead. As prices have fallen from $9000 to $6000 this year, trolls have once again infested the space, with surprisingly similar ratios to what we saw before. Meanwhile, in both cases, pundits went from "I'm still bullish" to mealy-mouthed "it could go up, but it could go down too" non-answers.
At the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015, as the price shot down one more time from $400 to $200, the pain, desperation, and trolling were out in full force. Forums were not a pretty sight. Concern trolling turned into outright mockery over people losing money. Honestly, I had to get away from it for a while too, and didn't talk about it in person anymore either. Here at the end of 2018, I suspect we're headed toward a similar trend; the move to $5500 might just be the beginning (a cycle proportional to the previous one would put the bottom around $3500-4000).
Again, who knows if this offers any insight for the future, but here's the rest of what happened before.
The first three quarters of 2015 were quiet, and really, just plain boring. While price drifted aimlessly between $200 and $300, participation in discussions was low. People either got bored or perhaps were just embarrassed to still be in the space, so trolls had no one to troll as well. Little did anyone know this was the absolute best time to buy.
Suddenly there was a sharp uptick back to $400 in October. This wasn't really enough for optimism to set in, as there were already several false breakouts, though this was the strongest upward move since 2013.
In my opinion, 2016 was actually the most interesting year, since it featured a steady bull market all year back to near $1000, without even much of a bumpy ride. The permabulls started getting more vocal again while the trolls retreated, but it still didn't seem there were many new people around yet. It's interesting to note that 2012 featured a similar steady bull run, but I wasn't around then.
Then 2017 happened, which everyone already knows about.
TLDR; The hype cycle appears to consist of a year-long parabolic bull run, a year-long bear market (with moods declining from optimism to denial to pessimism, I think we're just entering the pessimism phase), a year of boredom, and a year of a steady bull run back to the previous ATH. Granted, it's not a large sample size, but this has been going on since 2012, and a four-year cycle makes perfect sense with Bitcoin's halving pattern. If the future turns out remotely similar, we're not looking at new highs until 2021, but the bottom might be in early next year.

The reason I don't like the price falling this far is precisely because by falling as far as other bear markets, volatility hasn't decreased in a manner that would signal the maturity you described.
That may actually be a lamentation of the magnitude of previous spike though. Had it gone up less before falling back here, we could talk about decreasing volatility.
