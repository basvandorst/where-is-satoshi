Coinbase once again disabled my account and ignored all my requests for help except the last one about closing it. That one I received a reply in less than 24 hours. Which proves they chose to intentionally ignore the others. Good riddens Coinbase. Glad I am under the 20 grand parameter.

After 5 years I left Coinbase for good. They treat the small guy like crap. Ignoring requests for help. Disabling  buying all the time. Site always going down. Always giving lame excuses. Ok sorry I guess I am still upset. I won't go into detail but I see them as cryptocurrency control freak zealots. End Rant Proof they ignore you. I'm used the same method requesting help about how to close my account I received a reply in 2 hours. The requests asking why do I need to verify my ID again after having done so 3 times in 1 year. They never got back with me weeks later. Any questions? BTW I am 63 Born and lived in Virginia Beach/Norfolk area my entire life.

Yeah I kinda doubt that.  My experience has been the real wealthy take even less risk. I do not care how much he has 100K is always a whole lot to leave on any exchange.

Rand Paul? Why would you want to do that? I agree with busting out Ross though 
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:29:46
 what dismantling?

I knew a guy that worked for the IRS and he said just like the other commenting They only go after when percentages of income vs deductions go to far. I did some research 30 years ago and read that as long as I don't go further than a certain percentage I'd never be audited. I followed that rule self employed from 1985 to 2004. Guess what.  I was never audited.

What were we talking about?
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:06:06
Actually I'd think it depends more on how and where it ends up being spent. Don't you think?
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:28:50
Omg another trumptard drunk on the koolaid smh All I had to read was half way. YOU are the one fooled by the trump propaganda machine!!
@_date: 2018-05-17 09:21:52
And now they are claiming that Bing banning bitcoin ads is causing this recent bull run. I'm no expert but it's usually caused by very large sell offs and it always rebounds. But I'm no expert. I just look at it and say yay! Bitcoin is having another SALE!!! ��
@_date: 2014-06-05 02:14:13
I have been trying to buy 250.00 usd worth of bitcoin for over a week. I know I am not the brightest bulb maybe  last iq check about 140. But geez a meez I just run into one roadblock after another.  any tips? Should I just forget about using my VISA card. I know they say you can but trust me I have been trying for over a week. Ill take any suggestions. It was 563 a coin when I started trying to buy to give you an idea. lol

It's actually true . 
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:44:53
I'm planning on no. lol
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:25:43
I have 1 bitcoin for sale. Its only $300,000.00.
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:59:38
You win lol
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:08:40
I see btc's little ups and downs like bubbles in pressure cooker that's about to explode. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:05:36
I panic sold twice and twice I lost and regretted my move. But still early on I bought and sold playing the dips and won. At this point I  think I'm right back where I would have been if I never did anything. But I learned my lesson. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:52:39
I cashed out I hope they don't fold and take my money
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:42:19
And the way they word it is so unprofessional. "Note: You can no longer buy and sell bitcoin through us." How about "We no longer offer buying and selling bitcoin as before." idiots
@_date: 2016-12-09 20:13:45
What is this crap at the end of their B.S.?
A few reasons this option is ��:
Send money just like a text or email (or better yet, receive it)
Travel between $, £ and €. Best rates. No fees. No, really.
Put your money where your text is in iMessage
�� , �� and raccoons with grocery cart GIFs, for starters
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:32:52
 That is awsome!!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:30:23
Bitcoin having another sale! Yippee
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:31:05
Pretty sure ill always be happier at Gemini!
@_date: 2016-12-09 20:33:26
You call a 300% return on their bitcoin not a ton of money? What planet are you from?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:06:06
I am struggling to not panic!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:05:29
Well, here we are years later and still that question. How is it not a bubble? Because I said so.That's why.
@_date: 2018-03-04 15:24:05
And by the news today more proof that CB is run by thieves. I'm so glad I left. I think the lesson is simple. When an exchange starts ignoring its customers its time to get out immediately. That's what I did and I am now with Gemini. Smartest move ever!!
@_date: 2018-03-04 15:31:05
lol clearly another who lost his shirt and instead of learning from it to get smarter spends his days blaming others and the system. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:40:48
How many bought more today?
@_date: 2018-03-04 15:28:00
Not surprised. When they suddenly and with no exclamation disabled my ability to buy and then would ignore my requests for help I knew something is not right. I closed my account and opened one with Gemini. Smartest thing I did. Good riddance CB! 
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:56:23
I have left CoinBase. A very easy decision if you get my meaning. What a relief! I have joined up with Gemini. No comparison!! They have been super! Also I love the website format. Way more user friendly and reactive.  I do not work for Gemini and have not received compensation of any kind to write this.
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:11:37
It is also too big to create a dip from a few comments on reddit 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:35:37
I relate. With so many variables. I'm in for the long run. I just keep looking at the entire chart from day 1 and now about 10 years on. It tells me it's not going anywhere and it's going to go up. Call me the fool optimist. Definitely not putting all my eggs in a bitcoin basket though.lol
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:22:10
To make blanket statements like that is self defeating. Besides spending some what other contributions are you making to help scalability? I've spent bitcoin many times and look for places that take it. I also will take bitcoin as payment for my services and always. Let customers know that. I also hang out on reddit talking about the price.
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:08:36
Remember the big picture. Their will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. Thats all I can offer. But if you feel the fud that wont quit than yeah I understand entirely
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:29:57
I think your right. But as our economy slowly worsens and bitcoin awareness simultaneously increases scaling will happen automatically. What people forget is this is already occurring at a much quicker pace in struggling economies in many other countries.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:24:21
I'm sure you are right with that. I believe both will happen.  I just believe over the next 10 years bitcoin popularity will grow exponentially. The analogy of how the internet grew as a comparison is a good one especially when you look at how far its come in just under 10 years.
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:28:20
Pot meets kettle 
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:09:54
Many individuals have millions and some billions in bitcoin. I am betting on them being right.
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:35:26
So glad I left coinbase and joined Gemini 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:23:42
Sounds like you have lost faith 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:38:55
There are several  bitcoin debit cards now. The downside is having to deposit some bitcoin with the cardholder. Similar to a secure credit card.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:25:02
Also you can't expect to make friends by giving out unsolicited financial advice and making presumptions about people on reddit. You got what you asked for imho
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:31:02
Um yeah I think I'll believe him before you 
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:34:53
I wonder how many people are going to wait for a half decent bull run to be able to more easily afford the tax bill, albeit with a late penalty. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:37:40
Likely they have already set algorithms to set off red flags. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:02:25
LMAO ����
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:39:09
Bitcoin is becoming more popular for many uses depending on who you are and where you live. All one need do is research. It's far bigger and growing faster than what most people can believe. But so what if we in America mostly use it as a secure store of value as long as more and more people do also. Now if we were the only people with bitcoin that'd be like a ponzi scheme. But we aren't it's all over the world.
