Technically with Blizzard putting a value on gold, I'm sure the IRS would like you to declare that as income.

They should have called JG Wentworth.
It's their money and they need cash now!

How easy is it to cash out that amount of bitcoins?

Looks like his mom bought the drive with that on it.  I'm pretty sure it won't pan out to be anything at all.

You also have to take into account that if 1 bitcoin from Satoshi Nakamoto stockpile ever moves, the entire bitcoin empire would probably fall.
People would straight panic when that first bitcoin is moved and sell everything they have before the price sinks.  
It would signal that someone has access to his accounts and the market could just become flooded at any second which would render your bitcoins worthless.

I can use an example from my life as to why you need to stop even considering this.
My grandfather was crazy with stocks.  He always knew what to invest, how much to invest and when something major was going to happen.
He saw the housing market going under and knew the stock market was going to follow.  He pulled all my investments out and did the best he could to mitigate the hit I would have taken from doing this.
The hit I took was nothing compared to how much everyone else loss when the market went under.
I mentioned it causally at work what my grandfather said prior to the collapse and said nothing more about it.  It was literally a 1 minute conversation at the punch out clock that my grandpa said the stock market is going to take a massive hit and how he pulled my investments out. 
The market kept dropping and dropping and my coworkers used me as an excuse as to why they were losing their money.  They said I should have told them to pull their investments as well because my grandpa saw it coming and I did a poor job at warning them.
It was now my fault that they lost all that money rather than them accepting that they need to do a better job at managing their own funds.
Had they pulled out their money and he market went up, it would have been my fault they lost money once again and they would have resented me for that as well.
So TL;DR - Do not tell other people how to or what to invest their money in.  You will be screwed no matter what you say and the off chance you are right, they wouldn't care.

I'll tell you what my grandpa told me in 2008, what you said only works if people are rational...... they aren't.
He knew the stock market was going to tank and was one of the first people to pull out his investments then reinvest later on when it was at its lowest.
When people assume they are going to lose all their money, they will panic and sell because that's just what people do.
I think you're also vastly not really grasping how many bitcoins they have and how horrible they could flood the market if they wished.

Just have to really wait and see.  There's too many factors and our opinions can be impact by a lot of different things.
But I think you're wrong about thinking Satoshi coming back and thinking people will be fine with him controlling as much as he does.
Many people are investors looking to make a profit and if they had the option of killing bitcoins so they could make a few more bucks, they would without caring.

I could "donate" money on Paypal to someone like this over a decade ago.
The title and post are both r/cringeworthy.

People who bought or mined coins that knew about them that early would have sold of multiple times before last years peak.
There's also the huge risk that the drive they were kept on would have failed in the 5 years after you mined/bought them up to that point.
Everyone has their "I almost bought bitcoin back then" story but it's all bullshit as those who really made a killing were those who forgot they even owned them.
Hell, I even got a few coins from the guy who gave them out left and right when they weren't crap but I never bothered going to get them.

I only work for bitcoins, I don't want to pay taxes!

I talked too many people I know out of investing when it was at $17k because it was a massive hype based bubble.
There's just too many people holding a fuck ton of coins and can dump them on the market to make it drop whenever they want.
Then when they do that the market goes down, people keep pumping it back up hoping it would go back to where it was and they would double their investment.

Cool, I'll get to post this video in a few.

Until people throw more money at the tears of others and the price goes back up a bit.

Yea, I was talked out of buying Bitcoins back in 2010 because it wasn't accepted anywhere.
Unless the rest of the people who think they would be kagillionaires now, everyone I know that bought them as an investment sold when they were near $200 a coin.
Yes, they made like $100k-$200k but no one who knew they had them didn't cash out at that price point.
Also, if you look at how many exchanges were hacked or scammed people back then, you had like a 46% chance to have lost your bitcoins if you didn't know how to properly store them or trusted a site that went belly up.

Had a lot of people ask me how to buy bitcoins when they hit $17k.
I told them if they give me $4k and just buy them in a month they'd be saving money.

I was trying to talk my friends in 2010 to invest $500 each and they all said no so I didn't.
People here like to say I would be a billionaire having money fights with Bill Gates but the fact of the matter is you wouldn't have.
Other online friends all cashed out when their investment hit $200 per coin and most of the millionaires you hear about now literally forgot they even owned coins and just had a nice surprise when they found out they had some.
If you would have followed the history of bitcoins, many times sites closed and took your coins and many didn't get refunds.  People were hacked if they kept their coins not secure on their computers as well which made it an annoyance as well.
I felt that if I would have invested in BTC back then, I would have lost the coins up until the point they became worth what they are today.  I mean hell, the drive I would have kept them on doesn't even work anymore.
As for getting into it now, it is a gamble and I'd suggest maxing out other retirement accounts prior to investing into BTC.  It might not be a popular opinion here but max that stuff out and then invest in BTC if you have funds left to invest.

Had so many people asking me how to invest when it was $17k and I told them all when everyone is telling you it's hitting $100k is not the time you want to invest.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:39:56
I was talked out of spending $500 at the start on bitcoins.  I asked my friends and brother if they wanted to chip in and get some and they all made fun of me about it.
They told me it's that Diablo 2 currency that you spend real money on, can't get real money back and the only thing it trades for are items that don't matter.
If I hadn't listened to them, I'm sure I would have been hacked or had them stolen by now somehow but oh well ;p

When you deposit more than $10k a week, you have to fill out an IRS form with the bank right?

I'm not sure but I think OP is a bot or just a junk bitcoin poster based on their comment history.
