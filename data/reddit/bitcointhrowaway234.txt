Bingo. You need to either go clean or go under - as in stop using coinbase and ANY us exchange. If you need to cash out. Go with cash in person and make sure you are making the deals low dollar like less than $500. The current high fees and low processing times make this......quite complicated now, unfortunately. Don't use localbitcoins or any websites. Don't talk about your person BTC deals online. It is all being tracked and monitored as far as you are concerned.
Those who are smart and act now will be safe. You can probably do damage control if you stop using any electronic exchanges. The IRS is most likely going to purely be relying on these US exchanges to hand over user data. They will probably also be combing through bank data as well. Stay in cash. Don't put any BTC related cash funds into banks, ever.

The only thing CB is going to do is probably report your purchases and sales. So....bought 1 bitcoin for $7,000 on 01/01/2016. Sold .5 bitcoin for $3,500 on 06/30/2016 etc.
It will be up to you to determine cost basis. Also the buy/sell data is what the IRS is going to request from them. If you don't report then the auditor is just going to take all your sales and treat them as short-term capital gains with $0 cost basis. It'll be a correspondence audit and either you can agree to pay the assessed amount or provide what you think is the real cost basis for each transaction. It'll probably be a bulk mailing type project for the IRS. Eventually a few hundred thousand or million correspondence letters will be mailed out and everyone on this sub will be in a pure chaos.
