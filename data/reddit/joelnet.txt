Instead if usd you can transfer bitcoins to another currency like litecoin.  This process is called arbitrage.   You can find free bots that will perform bitcoin arbitrage.  The profits are very slim because people are already doing it.

I received a box from the first shipment of Juipters. After I pulled the case off, I took this picture. 
I had 3 friends that had also ordered Jupiters. Theirs arrived in the same condition.
Thankfully, there was no damage to any of them. They all mined just fine.
I was also going to sell my pre-order for my Neptune (first batch for existing customers). KNC removed my post from their forum. So I just issued a refund, which was received promptly.

2^256-1 is the possible number of private keys.  Shouldn't these examples use 2^160 for the possible number of public keys.  Since it's possible to have different private keys that can create the same public key?

Seems unnecessary when you can use BIP38 to encrypt your key.  Someone posted a BIP38 encrypted key that was only 3 characters to demonstrate the strength of BIP38.
Or use Electrum or Armory, they will generate a pass phrase (12 words) that have 128 bits of entropy.
The wheel has already been invented.

You can use any Android OS.  Factory reset your phone and permanently put it into airplane mode.  Download files from brainwallet.org or other open source javascript tools.  Generate the transactions in your read-only online wallet.  Transfer to the Android device and use the javascript with the default browser files to sign the transaction.  Move the transaction back to your online computer and submit the transaction.
for bonus points combine the javascripts into a single page application for just this purpose and walla, cheap offline hardware wallet.

This is correct.  I mined these when they were aprox 20 a piece.  I wasn't even aware a wallet was on that computer since it had been off for almost a year.  I turned it on with the intent of backing everything up to wipe the machine.  The hard drive crashed about 5 minutes after starting bitcoin-qt.  I believe it was the activity of syncing with the network that pushed the drive over the edge.  There's a bit of irony in the whole thing.

This method will generate a random pass phrase with 128 bits of entropy.
* generate a large random number.  i recommend generating a 16 byte (128 bit) hexidecimal number here: 
    * example: 07 3f 32 3f a5 f9 99 3b d9 4c df 11 6b 63 b4 76 
* use brainwallet's converter  
    *  remove the spaces: 073f323fa5f9993bd94cdf116b63b476
    * select source as HEX and convert to as POETRY.
    * paste your HEX value.
* now you should have a secure phrase for your brainwallet.
    * yearn doll moonlight anything stomach engine maybe freely heartbeat ache tap age
* for extra credit, you can paste your pass phrase back in as POETRY to get your original HEX key back!
edit: this is how electrum and armory create their SECURE seed.

The irony is I was currently in the process of backing up that data.  it was an old computer that was off for about a year.  I was about to back everything up when I noticed bitcoin was installed.  and for extra irony i believe the client syncing with the network is what caused the drive to fail.  the drive died about 5 minutes after i turned the bitcoin-qt client on.

This is absolutely correct!  If you REALLY value your data do not attempt home recovery.  I increased the amount of physical damage to my drive by performing deep scans.  All data recovery places suggest immediately disabling the drive.  I believe if I had done this, I would have been able to recover my bitcoins as well as other data.

They performed a clean room recovery on it.  Purchased another identical drive, swapped in new heads, the platters ended up scoring the new heads.  So they attempted a second time, which also resulted in damaged heads.  The platters themselves were scored, most-likely from doing deep scans at home with a damaged head.  There was nothing more they could do.
I have had previous luck doing a similar recovery with this company.  This time they were unable to help.

i understand bitcoin and do not understand this idea.  the block chain has no notion of "wallets".  it does know about addresses, but only addresses that have received funds.
phrases like "send this information to the block chain" and "ask network to check if there is any information about wallet" does not make sense in the bitcoin protocol.
instead of this idea, i'd recommend using a deterministic wallet like electrum as they have an easy way to recover all addresses within your wallet if lost.
