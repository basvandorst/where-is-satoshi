Yep, it has been more than 4 days to transfer coins from one coinbase wallet to a non-coinbase wallet. I have sent emails with no response

Thanks for posting this, hugely helpful! I had been looking through the comments but gave up before I got that far. Thanks!

Coinbase has known about this. That is why they have the message on their website about phishing emails. But they still keep it up.

Goodbye bitfloor, you'll be missed!

Can we stop with this stupid meme already
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:41:04
"Redditors get angry when you do one of those and then avoid questions that obviously shouldn't be answered..." Very understandable, lots of reddit is filled with dumbasses, especially in the larger subreddits. Thanks for sharing all you did, it is much appreciated

I've also done this. LocalTill [the company with the bank account you deposit funds into] charges ~1% fee. I have seen this go up to 1.5%. But you are always shown what the total cost is before submitting.

I think this is fake since coinbase doesn't have usernames, at least I don't think so. Every time I login, it is with my email address. So even if they had usernames, it would be the same as the person's email address

I think a hardware wallet for bitcoin could be a huge benefit.
Then again, using google authenticator along with a username/password is a relatively secure system. Plus with a smart phone, it would be easy to use bitcoin in the real world to pay for goods/services.

They are acting like greedy pieces of shit. All the parents I know have felt that raising a child is its own reward and payment. Don't give them a single satoshi.
I could see them saying things like "save your coin" and "don't spend it all on that Silk Road place". But trying to guilt you into giving your coins up, that's wrong

Doesn't even have to be thousands, could be hundreds. I wonder if bitcoin would work well with Craigslist in this regard: wouldn't have to worry about counterfeit bills when you buy that used whatever. Though the issue of the seller just outright robbing you still exists.

I just looked through his/her history. Doesn't seem like OKPay...
Would you mind answering approximately how much a day you move through them? Got an arbitrage bot near beta and bitinstant only allows moving $2k a day. Thinking of using OKPay to do $500 - $5k a day, but sketched about by them.

Thanks for letting us know what's up
edit: Just checked my account, all pending are complete. Thanks!

It's possible, but unlikely. After you specify a prefix, the random number generator is used as a starting point to determine the address. If someone knew your starting point, then it would theoretically not be as hard. But in general, you could spend centuries trying to compute an address's private keys and get nowhere.

It seems like coinbase is running properly new transactions but the old ones in pending still have problem. I just sent 10btc from my coinbase wallet to another. That took ~1hr, no problems. My transaction from 4 days ago is still pending. So at least it seems like new transactions are all good...

It is true, GoDaddy should be avoided. I know namecheap opposed SOPA and accepts btc
@_date: 2013-02-24 20:07:04
Could you describe the "Bitinstant-&gt;MoneyGram-&gt;BTC-e" route? thanks
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:48:57
The user Allstonedupha [ is also the same spammer...
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:46:32
So let me get this straight: we should start censoring this forum because you thought it was a smart idea to take free financial advice from reddit and got burned?
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:04:12
You can't multi thread the core of the trading engine. It has to be single threaded and you need lots of logging in case things get FUBARed. Sending images over the wire is nothing like this problem.

I've had a transaction pending for almost 4 days. I was only sending ~10 btc from my coinbase wallet to another wallet. When I emailed them over 48hours ago they said it would be resolved in 24hrs... &gt;:(
@_date: 2013-08-12 19:25:05
These sites already offer 2 factor authentication and the user has a choice. Why should this choice be removed? What if I don't want the same auth token used by both mt gox and btc-e? What if I use 10 exchanges and no need a separate token for each, what a pain! What about people that do automated trading and use permanent authorization keys? I think you need to understand the problem more before trying to solve it

1) Bitcoin is still in the experimental stage. This is well known and stated on the website:  It is not ready for prime time, no developers for the project have stated otherwise.
2) The point of open source is that you have access to the code. If you find a bug, then fix it. Waiting for someone else to do your work makes no sense.

My coins have been stuck in transfer for more than 24 hours. I was sending from coinbase to another wallet. I was just about to warn reddit of the issue, but glad to see someone beat me to it :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:19:22
I agree :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:46:28
Thanks you for this article.

If you are going to take action, do it sooner than later. He could be spending your money right now and every day that passes, you will get less back. IANAL but if I were you I would try to have funds frozen ASAP.
I was lucky and had bought and transferred my BTC a day before this happened. Glad I stopped myself from being lazy that day and just got it done.
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:20:32
Thank you for posting your analysis of what is happening in the market. It is much appreciated, especially with all the crap/memes that go flying around some days

Why would a firmware update not work? It is done with many other types of electronics
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:25:41
I had no idea... :( I feel like coinbase just keeps getting worse and worse
