I think the morale of the story is if you see another crypto do not just go all in. If he would of say only took out 30% then he would of been a lot better off.

Uhhhhh I think Android is even worse on the privacy thing. When I had a S8 Plus it would advertise to me. For example I would go to Arby’s and my phone would pop up a notification about how Arby’s was good and that I should go. It did this for many other stores. On iPhone 7Plus this never happens, also a week or two ago I was using my iPhone and thing popped up saying that messenger kept tracking me and asked if I wanted to turn off tracking. Apple makes money by selling hardware/Apple services where google makes money selling your data/services. Now android does win in the App Store freedom department.

I have a shift card but I store 90% of bitcoin offline (paper wallets generated from a computer with no internet access and connected to a printer with no wireless that is never connected unless I am printing bitcoin wallets) I just have for convenience factor but only transfer the funds to Coinbase when I plan on spending the bitcoin. Otherwise it is kept far away from my Coinbase account. Eventually I’ll get a trezor.

Yea android has its advantages, I personally just don’t care about customization on my phone. I just want it work quickly and smoothly. Now on my desktop I like a lot of customization  Nice thing is since both IOS and android exist so each can choose what fits them the best.
