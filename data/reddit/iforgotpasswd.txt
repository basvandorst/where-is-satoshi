I plan to create online gambling site which will use the coin(s). I created. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:38:17
I have couple idea on how make the game work without hosting actual wallets on my server. I know for a fact that no one trust any online wallet providers. Even I have my coins stored on a hardrive and locked up in vault.

I think you can not recover your bitcoin from paper wallet without using your private key. I check many forms and every single one of them use private key to withdraw bitcoin from paper wallet. I don't think you can withdraw bitcoin from paper wallet without using a client and importing the wallet into your client wallet/

A user create an account.
Use send BTC to "Bank Wallet" - &gt; When user send BTC to bank user right there and then get in-game points.  (Meaning the transaction goes from your wallet to another wallet the Bank Wallet)
The user uses points to make bets in a game, 
When user wants to cashout his/her points. 
A "Bank Wallet " transfer BTC to the wallet address that the user provides. 
Doing something like this would be no different than 2 people trading BTC anonymously.

Need a wallet on my server so the user can spend money quickly, another way I can tackle this problem is, I let the user buy in-game token when they send money to The "Bank wallet". So lets say you have a bitcoin wallet on coin base, from you coinbase wallet you send the "bank" = 0.00005BTC , in-game you recieve 5,000 points to spend on the games. When a user wants to cash out they simply click on cash out and paste their wallet address and the "bank wallet" will send out the BTC right to the user's personal BTC wallet no need to have a wallet on my server. This way is more secure and I'm thinking about using this method.

I will tackle each and every concerns that have been mentioned here. I will add multiple authentication for user and make the sites Bot proof and all others concerns. Hackers will keeping finding new ways to exploit software. Does not mean I should just sit back not try at all. I will work on my project I will make try to make it as secure as possible but I can't do anything unless I test it out. Before I even think about BTC I will use other alt-coins to test it. Just know this an idea I had and I'm just getting feedback. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:09:48
Why not? I mean now since I have the coin I'm planning to make a site for it and hopefully people will use it.

I'm still building a website which allow you to download the wallet, mine the coins if you would like to (Scrypt algorithm). I'll post an update.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:27:22
That is because sometimes if you import a private key it might be reused by the wallet app/web service and change is sent back to it. You want to avoid that because if you assume you've spent all the coins in the private key and then you make the private key public and change is sent to it somebody could steal your coins. So to avoid all that you import into a temporary blockchain.info wallet and spend all the coins in one go.
Because ultimately you want to store your coins on a desktop client for maximum security. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:30:25
not a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:54:43
well you can currently mine the coins. Thats what I'm doing right now and testing wallets for Windows and Linux. I'll try to make a simple site which guides a user on how to mine (Kudos)KS.

Nope, a bigger dip is coming from a mile away.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:35:13
Told ya, I'm gonna speculate that Bitcoin is going down to 2k and below.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:50:49
I know you're absolutely right, but I'm just saying there is one more dip coming and its going to really cause panic for people who recently bought BTC. Yes I have seen BTC chart from the time BTC existed and based on that I'm still saying BTC is going to drop. Am I wrong? Yes I can be wrong,its just that based on analysis of the BTC, I'm saying the price is still going to drop.  I'm just sharing my thoughts on what I think is going to happen to BTC price in next 12- months. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:41:23
Still not buying Bitcoin. Not until it drops more. Is it going to drop below 4k, 3,5k or all the way to 3k? yes it is and that when I'm going to buy. There no need to buy BTC right now the prices changing lightning fast and there is still no backing Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin price is only rising due to speculation that it will go above 5k,6k and higher but there is still limited use of BTC. No buying BTC those who buy and go to the moons good for you. Those who miss the trip don't worry Bitcoin is still has long way to go and just find the right opportunity to buy BTC.
