The same person is presumably transfering money from the same wallet to different sources, or to the same wallet from multiple sources. The machine could keep track of these addresses and trigger the identity check if the same address were used, say, 3 times in the last hour. Also, the confirmation times for these transactions would be self-limiting.
How many standard ATMs in the world are truly unattended? They all use a surveillance camera of some kind, whether it's built into the machine or pointed at it from across the room. Your identity is being passively recorded, and determined later if it's an issue

Generally criminal convictions work against you in immigration, but in practice it's just another card placed on the the table when making a decision to grant you a visa/residency/citizenship/whatever. If a negative decision is going to cost the government several hundred thousand dollars, it would at least be reasonable, or I dare say wise, to investigate whether that conviction works against the interests of St Kitts and its own citizens. Does he pose a threat to those interests, or those of its citizens?
Also, this rule of thumb really only applies if you openly disclose it up front.

Make a backup of your private key. Encrypt it with a passkey. (Bitcoin-QT and Android wallet will do this for you). Print the encrypted backup, and seal it in a weatherproof container. Bury it in the yard or wherever you like. Reveal the location to your heirs and a general description or understanding of what the key is. Place the decryption key in your will with no explanation. The clever ones fight to the death for it, or reach an amicable decision to divide it equally.
Not very convenient for the heirs, but I'm dead, so I don't care.

I've often wondered if DPR did this with at least some of his Bitcoins. Think about it - a wallet can literally be encrypted to a string of text that's small enough to be carved into a rock (or several) and buried in a park. Even if found, they're worthless without the decryption key. He can locate just one of the rocks after released and decrypt the key.

Withdrawing small amounts repeatedly from the same bitcoin address, or to the same address from different sources, would set off some flags. Anything outside the norm would attract the identification gauntlet.

I do that as well, but the idea is that I can still have access to some coins if I lose access to those services. I can also give the location of the ciphertext to a friend or loved one if I can't retrieve it myself. It's fun to allow my imagination to run wild with it.

See if he left a password manager like KeepassX on his computer. Being his spouse, you may be able to guess the decryption key to get a list of websites he may have used to purchase or mine Bitcoin. It's also entirely possible he was using this manager for keeping public keys as the username and private keys as the password.
Also look around for other signs of encryption software like TrueCrypt. It is used to generate encrypted files that can be "mounted" just like a USB drive would if you supply the correct password. If he was using that and you could decrypt it, you might find some unprinted paper wallets or a list of private keys. Don't share these private keys with anybody.

It will create at that rate for about 2 weeks. The network difficulty will then adjust - while it can decrease, it almost always increases by about 28%. In brief, you'll mine fewer coins every two weeks. Unless you can turn a profit in that two weeks, you never will

I don't think it makes sense to equate a small $20 to $300 transaction with large ones worth $10k. For typical chump change transactions let it stay anonymous, but for anything outside the norm (multiple sources, multiple transactions to the same wallet, high value, etc), ask for increasingly invasive identification measures. Putting off your most numerous customers means you make $0 from their non-transaction.

I tried to run a BTC node on a pi3 a couple of years ago and had a really bad time. Aside from the constant I/O completely thrashing the hard drive, it wouldn't sync the blockchain past 75% or so due to the CPU usage.

While the Raspberry Pi is a fantastic little computer for size and cost, there was (is?) an unfortunate design limitation where the Ethernet and USB ports all share the same data bus. So if you're maxing out the network with a download, the network activity stalls when writing to the disk over USB, and again when reading from disc into the Pi's memory. Combined with the slow CPU and limited memory, you'll end up waiting quite a while to download, write, and verify the entire chain when stored on a disc. Mine never actually finished, but as others have pointed out, it apparently takes weeks.  
I'm hopeful the 3B+ does not have the same bandwidth issues, but even if it does, syncing on another machine first should solve the problems I was having.

I've tried this on an original Pi and again on a Pi3.  The Pi4 does not have the same bandwidth issues - USB and network do not share a bus and its equipped with gigabit ethernet.

In the event of a hard fork, doesn't that mean the coins exist on two chains, and Coinbase controls the private keys for both of them?

I'm not a lawyer, but the article is not clear on this. What is the specific law being violated here? If a bank just has to fill out some official form reporting suspicious activity, why not just fill out the required form? These customers are being open and frank about their business; it's only suspicious because the "Suspicious Activity Report" form labels it as such. Just fill out the paperwork and accept the time spent as the cost of doing business.


That's all well and good, except there's nothing illegal about it.

Don't you need somewhat regular contact with the Internet to verify your transactions? I read that when Syria went dark, the blockchain "forks".

I'm not sure how much, or even if, ASB charges for wires. Kiwibank used to charge me $20 and Wells Fargo would slap on their fee with an exceptionally crappy exchange rate to boot.  I use XE because they've been the cheapest, by far, for sending money from NZ to the USA. It comes out as an EFT charge on my NZ account and appears as a debit deposit on the US side without any fees. 
Perhaps you could get an account with one of those banks and keep a minimal amount of funds in it, specifically for Gox transmissions? Sucks, but so does being stuck with currency you can't convert. Someday we'll just use Bitcoins to buy groceries instead  :)
