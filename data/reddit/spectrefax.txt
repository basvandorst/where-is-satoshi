You're obviously affiliated with HitBTC is some way. I'm sorry they failed the proof of keys event, but it is what it is. Good luck to you.

If they're freezing accounts to prevent people from pulling their crypto off, it's a pretty obvious fail of the proof of keys event. Seems pretty simple and straightforward to me.

I see. Basically any coin that is a base pair across major exchanges (BTC/XRP) gets all of the negative effects of the altcoin markets with none of the benefits. This actually makes a lot of sense.
Coins being added as base pairs is lauded as a great thing in the crypto community, but, in fact, if you want short-term or medium-term gains, coins that are base pairs should be avoided like the plague since they get all of the downside of the altcoin market and none of the upside.
Thanks for clearing this up for me, everyone.

Ok, going to try to explain this slowly one last time before I go ahead and block you.
Proof of Keys = An event whose SOLE purpose is to force the exchanges to prove they actually have our crypto available to us.
HitBTC freezes accounts in response to said event. Now... why would they freeze accounts during an event where users are simply trying to take out the crypto the exchange says they own and have full rights to withdrawal? There's really only one reason for an exchange to do that and if you need the reason to be spelled out to you, here it is: They don't actually have the crypto they say they do. In short, they're insolvent.

This would make sense except that when altcoins are crashing... the demand for BTC doesn't rise inversely, it seems  to tank right behind the altcoins. By your analysis, shouldn't crashing altcoins cause BTC price to jump significantly?

You're probably right. So much bullshit fake news and what-not in the crypto space. Maybe someone who uses HitBTC  can confirm.

BTC tanks in price, vast majority of altcoins follow with even larger losses.
BTC pumps up in price, vast majority of altcoins follow with even larger gains than BTC.
Altcoins tank in price, BTC follows with only slightly lower losses.
Altcoins pump in price, BTC doesn't really move.
This relationship confuses me.
