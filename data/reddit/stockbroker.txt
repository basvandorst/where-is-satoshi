Assuming bitcoins continue to go up/stay flat, and your tenant can afford to pay higher and higher prices for bitcoin. That's a big assumption, and a big gamble, particularly if you use rental payments to pay a mortgage.

I don't participate in bitcoin, but I do find you folks interesting. That said, this is the kind of stuff that will attract very negative attention to bitcoin. The government won't like this one bit.
