Sorry for piggybacking, but you have a typo on the "how to pay" diagram [here]( ([direct image link]( Text reads "Scan QR code with _Mobie_ Wallet" instead of _Mobile_.
Outside of that, really glad to see you guys taking bitcoin! Bumped you up in my order book above Newegg.

TextSecure also has perfect forward secrecy and bitmessage very much does not. I use both, but bitmessage is lightyears behind (they're working on it though!).
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:46:49
These are valid points, which shouldn't surprise me coming from you!
As it stands, every crypto tool has disadvantages and advantages. I typically recommend TextSecure to layman due to it's dead simple UX. People tend to balk at something as straightforward as Tox or Bitmessage as soon as they see the UID's.
I'm not sure if you're still actively working on Bitmessage development, but either way thanks for the tool and all your hard work. Open source can be a thankless job with people demanding updates and new features, so I want you to know that those of us using your tools really do value and appreciate them!

When has it not been invasive at the very least? 
@_date: 2016-05-09 03:49:19
But you can't just print more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:37:50
Additionally, does it compress as it uploads within the client?
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:28:18
Uh, [they already accept bitcoin for Reddit Gold](

You can [solo mine]( for the (current) 25BTC block reward. The calculator I linked has an _average_ solo block generation time of ~42 days at 60Gh/s at a 50 million difficulty. However, it can be much shorter (if you get lucky and figure out the key quickly, or _much_ longer. You can set up solo mining with most mining clients, though I'm not sure how - a quick google search will probably reveal it.
The serious guys have _tons_ of hardware (FPGA's at the moment), superior cooling systems, and some even use custom software. The biggest difference is definitely the scale.

Integrating [automoderator]( to automatically delete all the meme sites definitely slows the fall.

If anyone is looking for a referral to start off with 10GB, then [here is mine](

I'm a [colorist]( Not sure if that's what you're looking for, but I applied!

Blockchain [just tweeted]( they have 400K wallet users with 1K new signups per day.
@_date: 2013-03-22 04:44:17
I do the same. Even comment on occasion. I find the community pretty interesting even though I just window shop.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:35:12
Interesting, I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2013-03-15 17:29:17
I posted this [yesterday]( over in It's great to see it already spreading over to the bigger sub and gaining momentum!
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:43:45
Thanks again.

He's also the guy who wrote the original GPU miner, so I imagine he's doing just fine.
@_date: 2013-03-31 04:30:09
I think the [buy bitcoins]( chart might be more interesting.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:06:56
I preordered one in USD at the end of Nov. I almost feel like I beat the system ^^^almost.

If you use Google Spreadsheet you can actually use an [automatic formula]( someone on created to pull in the live data.
Even easier is to go to your [Google spreadsheet]( and do the following: 
* Tools&gt;Script Gallery
* search "bitcoin"
* install "MtGox Bitcoin Last Value" 
* Accept/Allow
* enter "=getBitcoinLastValueFromMtGox()" into your cell
All done! All the rest of your formulas should update automatically by either linking this sell, or using getBitcoinLastValueFromMtGox() as a variable in your formulas.

Sort of an unrelated question, but do you guys allow uploads larger than 2GB? Right now, as far as I can tell Dropbox are the only guys that can do that. In my line of work, we're frequently sending files 4GB+.
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:46:40
You're actually downloading from other people using the bitcoin-qt client (which is partially why you have to download the entire blockchain).

I guess it's a good thing they'll never actually mine any sizeable amount of bitcoins due to the difficulty.
@_date: 2013-03-22 04:02:53
The difficulty factor is expected to increase to between 50 and 100 million which dramatically reduces the payouts. Additionally, this calculator does not take power usage into account. [Try this one instead]( and upping the difficulty to 50 and 100 million.

Assuming they ever ship, you merely need to plug the ASIC into a host computer and run a mining software (such as BFG miner or [many others]( and enter the login data for your [mining pool]( Note that the electricity costs of this host computer will affect your costs as well (it needs to always be on in tandem with the ASIC). Many people use lower power hosts (such as the Raspberry Pi) to mitigate this issue.
Technically, that's all you need to do, though this is only a very basic setup and a far cry from what the serious miners are running.

Thanks! Glad the spreadsheet worked out for you.
