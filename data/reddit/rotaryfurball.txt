It's not a dumb questions. Lol. I would recommend using LTC because the fees are much lower than BTC and the the transactions are faster ( if that affects you). And I don't really understand the privacy thing. 
Hope it helps

It seems far. But it's doable. All the big companies are getting in and with that means that the general public will see it's not just some money crackheads use.

Not really. You cannot predict the future.

The new fork

I don't know what your trying to say but here's my opinion. Save up every dollar you can. Avoid Starbucks, use coupons, eat out less, and with the money saved put it in Bitcoin. You may feel that we are already over the "early adopter phase" or however you put it. But we are still the 1% that is in this industry. There is still potential to make a shit ton of money.
