Good point

Yeah I know it's to make the difficulty more stable, however the algorithm doesn't seem very clever and makes the network vulnerable in the situation described above.

Yeah but I don't think that BTC plans a hardfork anytime soon. The devs are very conservative.

Well, no one really knows. 
If I wanted to play Captain Obvious here I would say that the supply is greater than the demand.
There can be many reasons:
- people losing interest (partly because fights like this one make the situation too complicated and bring the trustworthiness of crypto down)
- whales or state institutions trying to push the price down 
- maybe even the fighting sides needing to fuel the hash war, thus selling their BTC to buy more hash power (hw + electricity).
As I said - no one really knows the reason.

Good question. That is a mystery to me.

1. The hash power will be put into the coin with the highest miner revenue.
2. IMO hash power has very little effect on the price of the asset. Actually I think hash power is the effect of the price, not the cause (because of 1.)

The difficulty readjusts itself every 2016 blocks.
The problem arises when you take a significant portion of hash power away.
For example when you relocate 50% hash power suddenly you make the whole network 2 times slower. Every block will take 20 minutes to create instead of 10. Capacity is halved and confirmation times are doubled. 
That means waiting for those 2016 block to be mined will also take twice as much time as it would normally. This way, if you suddenly turn off let's say 80% of the hash power you essentially cripple the network. With it comes a fall of price because as the usability goes down, so does the value.
