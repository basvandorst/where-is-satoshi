After 5 days of transactions not getting confirmed... what did you expect?
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:15:51
It's really important for me to wait 3 weeks for a transaction to get included into a block.
@_date: 2016-06-03 11:52:54
I pay the required fee. The fact that 10000 ppl did the same thing, made my transaction go to limbo. But hey, maybe i did not pay 1 BTC as fee to transfer 0.1 BTC. I'll know better next time. Thanks for your help. I see it clearly now
@_date: 2016-06-12 09:57:32
Basically we're all going down the tube and Bitcoin is our last hope?
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:50:48
Fuck the old nodes. If people were really using them, they would be up to date and running latest software. Anything under v0.11 is banned from my Node. Problem solved.
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:42:54
Does not scale today. Tomorrow it will. Stop ruining it for everybody
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:53:48
So how come we're not peer reviewing an HF to 10 MB? Ohhh rightttt. Because the peeps at 1 Company don't want to do it. Much decentralization at Blockcore
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:54:19
Until... you know... It goes down on the weekends
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:58:02
Because not all transactions will be SegWit transactions. I for one will not use SegWit transactions till we get a HF.

Party time
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:42:21
Evidence or gtfo.
@_date: 2016-06-09 06:44:24
We'll talk more when you'll pay Visa/Mastercard fees. Maybe then you'll understand what i'm talking about. Good day
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:40:51
Typical western attitude and BS. What about the other 8 billion? In India you can eat for 2 days with 10 usd. Do you think they'll pay enormous fees to move cow shit?
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:29:38
@_date: 2016-06-09 05:21:10
Buy BTC
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:41:52
Yeah you should sue them for believing in Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-06-03 11:50:10
Then you should be the first one admiting there is a problem with Bitcoin. The fact that you are blind to this problem makes me think a lot about how you got your Diploma.
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:16:44
Lol. That plan is 2 years old and we still ain't seeing an increase in Blocksize. Yet the Blocks are full AF and everybody is waiting for pre - alpha releases. That being said, i'm stashing as much as possible, because in 3 years when we will have a HF to a larger Block size everybody will.go crazy 
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:05:25
True that. I'm.out of fiat. All in crypto now. Let's see how this year plays out. Looks good till now
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:49:27
There still is urgent need for a HF Gman. It may not be on your To-Do list, but when you get your ass handed to you one day, you'll think again about this and realise you were wrong. I will be there to hand you that Ham sandwich you never had
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:14:39
Decentralize the Dev team first.
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:54:44
This is fucking awesomeee. Gg guys
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:13:32
Isn't it funny how a decentralized software is controlled by 1 company? I can't wait to hear what they have to say once another crypto currency surpasses Bitcoin. We wanted to make money with our Blockstream company because our VCs needed more money in return, so we decided to screw bitcoin so much, nobody will.make any money.
@_date: 2016-06-02 11:04:52
More like speed of light
@_date: 2016-06-02 21:05:56
Lol. Go back to Blockcore and wait for Gman to tell you what to say next. All Hail the Overlord
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:07:50
Because of people like you, Bitcoin will always be that experiment that failed because of.... you guessed it, assholes like you. Bitcoin has changed so much since 2009. If you actually believe what you just wrote, why are you not running the 2009 version which had a 32 mb blocksize? Good day
@_date: 2016-05-12 09:43:33
Yeah sometines i feel like a freak... So that's why i'm not invited to parties anymore.
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:01:43
Moon? :P
@_date: 2016-05-12 09:41:39
Try Circle
@_date: 2016-05-07 14:02:32
You beat me to it. As for OP, Dude i'm buying as much as i can and i'm Hodling till we reach the moon. It's this or i go down with the ship.
@_date: 2016-05-07 11:07:19
The FED
@_date: 2016-05-12 12:58:01
You said usd so I thought you're in 'Merica
@_date: 2016-05-11 22:18:35
It can't remain uncorrupted with all the politics and drama queens around... I'll stay positive and hope for the best. May the Halvening be ever in your favor
@_date: 2016-05-23 10:07:35
Dude that's not ok. What i noticed while trying to do this was that my PC was using around 30 or 40% of Processor ( quad core Intel 2013 model ). Raise the DB cache level and it should do it a lot faster. Not sure if DB cache. Google and you'll see what i'm talking about
@_date: 2016-05-07 09:53:49
Let me get my Tin Foil. You're right. But this has to start somewhere. Panama papers is just the beginning of a brighter future ( that's if you're positive ) or a darker future ( they just find a different company to lauder their money ). Everybody knew this was going on. But now we have some kind of proof. 
I for one can't wait to download the files once they are open to the public.
@_date: 2016-05-18 11:57:06
Meh. It takes about a week to get all confirmed on any exchange. I buy mine in about 30 seconds from Circle
@_date: 2016-05-23 11:26:08
Yes that's it. Increases speed a lot. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 15:04:18
So why are we being told that miners will leave when they are just leveling up?
@_date: 2016-05-24 11:08:31
What Bra? Didn't you pay 10 Bitcoin in fees to transfer 0.02 Bitcoin? And this is why a fee market is bad for ya
@_date: 2016-05-13 06:24:03
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:52:20
Always backup your wallet
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:02:39
It has nothing to do with that. I love Bitcoin and thr ideas behind it. I'm just afraid that our first mover advantage will soon be taken and fucked my the banks while we stay here thinking about what Bitcoin could have been... Excuse the language
@_date: 2016-05-16 10:07:50
FUD. Stop with all this drama people
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:27:10
Thanks guys
@_date: 2016-05-14 15:34:51
When i was in India i could not buy my trains tickets online using any of my Credit Cards. Found a site which sold them to me for Bitcoin... That was when i understood why Bitcoin was going to succeed. Have fun playing that game kid.
@_date: 2016-05-24 22:37:05
Thanks for the answer. I think i'll buy one and sweep the BTC to one of my Keys.
@_date: 2016-05-11 09:28:24
Yeah in 2 years...
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:09:24
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:59:48
Wait, i don't understand. Aren't they spendable bitcoin? Say i buy 1BTC coin for 1.1 BTC. When i receive the coin from BTCC couldn't I just sweep that 1 BTC to one of my wallets?
