Maybe stop scamming honest sellers by filing chargeback requests after you've received the item you bought and it works as promised.

Well, if you haven't had any problems with paypal ever, you have no reason to criticize them, that's fair enough. Just as fair as it is for those who's businesses literally have been fucked over by paypal, to criticize paypal by complaining on their high fees and unfair chargeback mechanisms which seems to be the most common problem.
After all, there's a reason why many service providers are among the earliest to adopt cryptocurrency payments and boycotting paypal. But I get your point, and it's valid.

People who enjoy insane fees, and of course scammers who buy shit and file a chargeback request after a successful delivery, to steal the money back.

So, you're selling physical items and use a trustworthy delivery company that can prove to Paypal the item was delivered/returned properly. You also got seller protection from Paypal on all your sales, which means higher chance to win the chargeback cases, and you got the customers address and personally identifiable information so that you can find them if they don't pay or try to scam you.
Last but not least, you sell enough to get lower fees than most smaller companies with less sales, the more you sell the lower fees. Of course paypal works well for you.
But try to use paypal when selling a service, or basically anything that doesn't give you seller protection or is easy to prove that it was indeed delivered and has been used by the customer. Scammers know enough about paypal to choose properly which companies they should target for ther scams in order to win both the purchased item and their money back.

Well at least it's still positive interest, I got negative interest on my banks savings account.
