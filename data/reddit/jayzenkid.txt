By this do you mean the liberty teller atm by south station?

Everyone in those comments is praying for bitcoins to fail. Little do they know that as long as the darknetmarkets exist, it will always have value.
@_date: 2014-07-10 20:02:43
Completed you should post the results. Also, giving away a beer would be quite enjoyable.
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:57:10
Down for me too.
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:29:23
Woww $13,000 gone like that. That person's gonna be depressed for a while unless they're rich. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 20:01:32
I'm actually having the same problem, did you make any progress?
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:51:03
Someone should do a venmo one that shows how you don't have to give your bank info or card info but you can still send or receive money.
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:27:21
Google exists. Wikipedia is still online too. Just saying.
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:36:00
Not surprised. I wonder when/if it gets implemented how long it will take to get your coins after you buy.
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:42:18
All you have to do is transfer them to a wallet without putting a fee. If you're using blockchain.info to do it go to your account settings and set the default fee policy to frugal.
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:39:46
wow officer gofuckyourself needs to be fired asap.
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:13:11
Yup we go through China then head back towards the moon.
@_date: 2014-07-22 19:15:05
The Bitcoin ATM's in mass so far require no form of idea at all but then again you can't withdraw cash from them.
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:40:54
Did you have it so that blockchain emails you every time someone goes on your login page on a different ip address? This would have helped prevent this hack as well.
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:06:59
To the mantle! ↓↓↓

Where can I donate bitcoin to ALS??
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:41:10
I'm no expert so I can't help you there but I know this is the 2nd or 3rd time this week someone complained about coinfog stealing their coins and locking them out of their account. They seem like a scam site now.
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:13:17
I'm in the US sent you a message.

This article is dumb. I'm not trusting an article made by a freshman in college with zero sources.
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:57:21
I did it. When do I get the free bitcoins?!
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:32:28
Well put, here's a quarter. @_date: 2014-07-21 21:09:52
Wow for a while I thought I was the only one who used that atm because they always seem so in awe when I go their just to put money into the atm and leave.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:31:17
I looked up the wallet they gave me to donate bitcoins and it seems like they may generate new wallets for each donation because there is no record of anyone else sending them bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-22 13:24:14
Also x'ing out the window or restarting your phone doesn't sign you out either.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:12:26
Good work! Have an upvote @_date: 2014-07-28 15:38:45
Fixed. Had to delete old blockchain app first.
@_date: 2014-07-10 18:12:39
Different ATM's have different times I guess. I went to a Liberty Teller bitcoin ATM yesterday (only in Mass for now) and I just had to walk up to it, scan my barcode from the blockchain app (or whatever you use) and then add the money. I could see the transaction in the blockchain app within 5 seconds.
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:38:32
Ok all of a sudden it has 63 confirmations. I guess blockchain was backed up or something. Will be closing this post.
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:15:49
I hate how you can see where his bitcoins are going and can't do anything about it. I would love 500 BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:08:45
It gives you brand new clean coins and it's the one mixer no one has lost coins on so far.
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:49:59
True well it's the easiest, fastest, and most reliable way to tumble without sending coins through multiple exchanges.
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:39:10
This is overly accurate.
@_date: 2014-07-09 21:23:31
Someone tip this man, he's desperate. Or you can hit a bitcoin atm, the money goes to your wallet asap
@_date: 2014-09-06 17:12:35
Look into helix by grams def the best mixer out.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:38:45
For some articles they aren't in the mobile version of the website so instead of only needing to scroll up and down you also need to scroll from left to right to read the article. The website I had to scroll sideways with was bitcoinist.net.
@_date: 2014-08-13 19:16:37
Seems like this could very easily be used for prostitution. The new craigslist casual encounters.
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:48:57
libertyteller.com These atms may only be in the Boston, MA area though.

To get money out you'd need your public address and private key. I assume you scan the qr code of both of those things.
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:28:00
Keep getting this. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:49:48
HAHAH I heard this song a couple weeks ago and thought about it too but def didn't think it was about bitcoins. Young Thug doesn't seem smart enough to know about bitcoins. Funny post though, here's an upvote @_date: 2014-07-15 21:19:08
I noticed this while it was happening on coinmarketcap.com I should've invested to earn a quick payout smh.
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:53:08
Free coins please! 1K2Wnm5PwJvmobsugZ57ce6skbikrQpvPF
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:32:10
Damn I thought he reduced the fee to 1.5. Guess he changed it back.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:20:08
Why is that happening?
@_date: 2014-12-30 07:27:53
Use Helix by grams you can find it on tor. The url is on dnstats.net.
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:45:40
Send me to the moon!!
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:01:58
It's also quite hilarious that this video was uploaded 30 minutes ago but it shows an empty Mt. Gox wallet that he transfers his "generated" bitcoins into. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:36:31
Helix by grams but it's a 3% fee.
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:55:57
Bitcoin ATM. Instant and anonymous.
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:55:08
Here's an upvote @_date: 2014-07-02 14:07:31
This is cool but I still would cold storage my bitcoins myself. I don't trust any exchange website after the Mt. Gox debacle.
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:23:33
Yea wtf and then when you click to purchase it asks for a shipping address.
@_date: 2014-07-24 17:51:37
Poor college student here. 1BRX3vFxz5NmM4XFLX7jYq67kyJGXgouhN

I feel like this will be taken out after the Bitlicense comes into effect since it doesn't require ID.
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:32:28
3 BTC! Let's hope it goes below $10 for at least a minute.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:07:41
Happy Tuesday!!
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:03:56
Thanks for the coin!
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:06:15
I prefer to use Electrum to store my bitcoins on my personal computer. I only have a little now so when I get to above a bitcoin I'm gonna transfer it to cold storage. I added my electrum to blockchain via watch only so I can still see my account there.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:03:36
Someone offered $300,000 when he had the same amount as info as you and he still hasn't received his stolen bitcoins. Basically, your money's gone. Be more careful next time I guess :/
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:12:13
What do you use to day trade?
