Using your ratio treatment, would you consider these simplified BCH sale assumptions correct?  as a long term capital gain instead of ordinary income?
- bought 2 BTC in 2015 at $500 each ($1000 total cost basis for the asset)
- BCH spilt off of BTC in Aug 2017, and was valued at 15% of the  value of BTC at the time of the fork
- therefore the BCH portion of the asset's cost basis is 0.15 * $1000 = $150
- sold off the 2 BCH in Dec 2017 at $2,500 each: $5,000 total BCH sale
- Capital gain of $4,850 ($5,000 - $150)
- Long term gain since the original purchase and money invested was in 2015

Dude, you'd be better off by buying $800 worth of Bitcoin.

I think the insurance is only for the cash they hold for you, not for Bitcoins... If it's a significant amount of Bitcoins that you want to hold on Coinbase you should choose the option to keep it in their cold storage Vault which has a 48 hour waiting period to withdraw Bitcoins from, during which time they'll ask for your verification from 2 of your email accounts.  The idea is that if you get your account hacked you'll have enough time to get notice of the activity and stop the transaction.  Also be sure to set up a 2 factor authorization (Google app).  Personally I think Coinbase a pretty low risk and easy way to store your Bitcoins although alot of coiners prefer to have full control of their coins using a hardware wallet.

What happens if your Trezor fails and can't turn back on?

Good info, thanks!

Sure, why not?  Comparing the valuations makes it look like orders of magnitude growth for bitcoin is still very possible.  A major store of value should at least be valued higher than individual tech companies!

You may try hypnosis (or meditation) to help dig up old memories... For your safety just don't disclose the magnitude of money on the line!  Good luck...
