You're talking about [Arbitrage!]( that makes sense.

Now would be a great time for bitcoiners to swap to credit unions! they are relatively local establishments which probably don't ask for your ID.  Mine has been great so far, certainly done my fair share of BTC/LTC to USD deposits with them no problem.

Ah! see I was wondering if there would be any sort of leaking effect to other exchanges, and as a result the price of BTC in general.  aren't all the exchanges sort of tied to one another?  Apologies for ignorance...

I think you missed the part of the website quote where he attributes the drug penalties and anti-LGBT sentiment to his opponent.

I'll take some!
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:14:21
yeah.  why is that a fake price?

not the best thumbnail picture to inspre confidence in the title :P  but cool!

well, Mt Gox is losing the faith and BTC of the people, and rightly so, so there's been a major selloff.  Don't panic people, it shall pass because there are much better exchanges.

what evidence do you have to back that up?  not trying to be dickish but I'd like to hear more about this.

Great question!  I believe its true that credit unions have different criteria for joining, but for mine they only required a $40 deposit in your account, and no fees!  That was super reasonable in my opinion, especially if you're just about to move all your money anyway.  Your results may vary of course, but all you have to do is ask them!

do you think its a better idea to hold on to your coins or spend them now?
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:42:21
hey awesome! thanks man.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:32:00
you started a credit union?
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:10:57
I don't know if its really a plausible idea for most, but I'd look at putting money into a credit union.  They are more localized and either have no stake in Bitcoin or don't care what you do with the money.

Well done!
