Yeah, the overall vibe I got was pretty positive. He said he didn't comment on Bitcoin as a speculative investment, but on illicit use of it. As for speculation, he said people should their own research and be careful buying bitcoin. And to be honest, I pretty much agree with him. This is absolutely insane, Bitcoin may have gone actually mainstream this week.

I've owned a ledger for quite a while, and recently got a trezor one as well. I'd say for most new people, the Trezor has a \*much\* better user experience. Of course, the Ledger may be slightly more secure for various reasons.

I know it's not the answer you're looking for, but literally NOBODY knows how much it's going to affect the price. Even AFTER the halving, it's almost impossible to determine whether a price increase (or decrease?) was the direct effect of the Halving. Plan B's recent Stock-to-flow analysis may be a decent argument for a significant price increase, but even he can't know for sure. If we're talking about BTC price, there are so many other factors at play (political, economical, etc.) that it's risky to view the halving as an isolated event.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:27:05
I agree with you. I simply wasn't a fan of the other redditor's claim Bitcoin is destined to do x, as if it is inevitable. But yeah, it fairly likely.

I am 95% in bitcoin, and holy shit, what a comfortable position that is! I used to stress out a lot, making poor trades, always missing out of having fear of missing out. Now I got my position in bitcoin and I'm holding. It really is so much more comfortable, and helps me focus on other stuff such as work, friends, hobbies, etc.

I actually wrote hodl first but changed it, because I strongly believe we should get rid of the meme. The thing is, holding bitcoin is a legitimate strategy and an smart thing to do (especially compared to trading, instead). The HODL-meme is fun and all, but it's a bit immature. I want people to take Bitcoin and holding bitcoin seriously.
edit: if i said this at the frontpage, people would probably downvote me into oblivion, but i respect every opinion :')
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:39:12
I love the sideways action. I hope this continues for months, as the price slowly creeps upwards as we near (and pass) the halving.

I'm having a career that has absolutely nothing to do with (macro)economics, trading, currencies, etc. In a sense, my btc is a hedge for my work, and my work is a hedge for bitcoin (in case it actually goes to 0). I'm sure a career in crypto (a.k.a. Bitcoin / blockchain) can be highly profitible, but there's always a certain degree of risk. I'm very happy with the clear division between work and tc in my case

Yeah, but the amount of adopters will keep increasing (and theoretically never decrease). Therefore, with every single new adopter, a new ATH will be reached. That's the point he was making.

I thought at 8K it was waaay too vertical and it was time to sell. It's hard to assess BTC's momentum and when it wears off.
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:05:49
I have much less money invested, but I used about 60% lump sum to get a decent position around $9000, and I'm completely prepared to suffer a 30% loss from that price, if need be. From now on I DCA about 2% every week. After getting rid of my 'spendable money', I consider unfollowing this sub, uninstalling twitter and force myself not to check CMC. I may perform some small purchases if the opportunity arise.

That's... 3 data points? Not a lot. Also, if a recession hits somewhere the next few years, no one knows what btc is going to do. It can go either way. I haven't been in btc for long, but I do know that it's never going to do what I expect it to.

Jesus Christ, get over yourself. It's still the accumulation period. If you care so much about the value your current investment, you're over-invested. Don't buy anything for a couple of months, simple.
Also, go wstch some Bob Loukas videos, unsubscribe from the Bitcoin reddit, get off twitter for a while and DON'T check coinmarketcap.com until bitcoin reached something like 100k, assuming it will happen in a reasonable timeframe of 4-5 years.
I may sound like an asshole, but I honestly care about your mental well being. There's more to life than bitcoin, despite it being incredible exciting.

Buy a little every month. Try to somewhat keep up with the news, but don't start spending every second of every day on Reddit or other news channels. Read the Bitcoin whitepaper. Watch Andreas Antonopoulos' videos. Don't tell anyone how much you own. And be VERY careful with telling your friends about bitcoin (you may cause them to buy at an unfortunate time, and they may blame you for their loss).

Your average pleb will see Bitcoin at 50,000+. They will think "Well darn it, I don't have 50,000+ dollar, I can't afford a Bitcoin!". They'll take a look around, and see a shitcoin like XRP. "I'll be damned, this coin is only 30 cents! I can get plenty of this coin! And if this coin gets to 50,000+ dollar, I'll be rich as fuck!".
And thus, a new alt rally will start. Just like 2017. Assuming these bubbles will never return is silly, really.

We really have to stop hyping up the halving as a catalyst. Yes, after last 2 halvings price went up, but who knows what happens this time. We could be in a recession, and we don't know how that's going to affect BTC both long or short term.

This sentiment has been around since forever. The world is going to hell, etc. However, I do think it is fascinating to see another recession brewing, but this time we have deflationary, non-governmental, non-national currency. The next 5 years are going to be ~~fun~~ interesting as hell!

Well, for as far I understand it, ETH was supposed to be pay miners, for smart contracts, etc. ethereum was meant to be a supercomputer and not a currency, so the price of ETH shouldn't be too important. Also, in that light the more inflationary nature of ETH makes somewhat sense. It's not Bitcoin, and most importantly, it's not trying to BE Bitcoin.

The UI is pretty decent with both, but the UX is just so much better. I don't like navigating with just the two buttons of the ledger.
However, recovering your wallet is easier and more straight forward on the Ledger. If I had to 'rate' the two devices, they'd end up pretty close to each other. I just think that my mother (as a metaphor for a less tech savvy person) would have a better time with the Trezor.

No one knows. Just either DCA in (weekly or every two weeks, with small amounts), or just take a bigger position and stick with it. You're not gonna get rich (day)trading, and waiting for a drop is very risky. Remember all the people who were predicting 1-2K in december? Yeah, exactly. You completely eliminate the risk of being one of those people by DCA-ing or taking a single, bigger position.
Maybe we go to 8-9K, but trying to maximize your profits by waiting for a drop is too risky (in my opinion) when the upside is sooooo much bigger.

Sure we can, if we take a more rational approach we can override this. Symbols should serve us and make our lives easier.

@_date: 2019-10-16 08:56:03
Once you've send your tx, it joins all other transactions in the mempool (memory pool, or 'waiting area'), which every full node keeps track on. Once a miner finds a block, they pick txs from the mempool and put these in the block. The higher the fee, the more likely it is your tx gets picked first.
After sending your tx you can safely close your app, since your tx is part of the collective mempool.
*Edit: I'm still learning about BTC, so if my explanation is faulty in any way, feel free to correct me.*

Seems to me like you read to much in the anonymous 'prophecy'. To be honest, those few people on 4chan and reddit who care about the prediction, won't stop believing in Bitcoin just because this prediction is nullified. I can't believe any whale would be willing to risk their assets in manipulating a market to invalidate a random prediction no one really cares about.
Also, the 'manipulating' we're talking about is just part of a decentralized monetary protocol such as Bitcoin. I wouldn't call it manipulating tbh, I would call it fair game.

You're asking a priest whether he believes. 
Truth is, no one knows for sure. I decided I want to take the risk, but we don't know whether it's going to be worth it.
On the other hand, even if bitcoin fails and completely goes to zero, it was fun to be part of this ride. So yeah, for me, it's definitely worth it. You make your choice, and don't forget to educate yourself.

Well, I do have a running DCA strategy week with low weekly amounts. The btc i bought at 11k were just... 'bonus'.
Edit: I actually WANT the price to go lower. But we have no guarantee, so I made I did the most sensible thing by buying. With the caveat that I need if the price drops, I am comfortable with my position and will not get greedy (i.e. sell and buy more later to maximize position).

Just buy a little bit every week (same time, same amount, that's called DCA - Dollar Cost Averaging). In this sub we believe it's going to be higher eventually. Just be prepared for a 30% drop at ANY time. Ignore it and keep DCA-ing for at least a year. If the price gets extremely high, just stop buying in and go with the flow.
Also, there's more to Bitcoin than just the price. Make sure you do some in-depth research and learn to appreciate the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:42:33
I'm super curious whether they're gonna be positive, negative or neutral about Bitcoin. I ordered a copy, and will report back once I received and read it!
Regardless, it's insane that they are mentioning BTC in a popular children's comic.
Edit: According to first reports, the storyline is about Scrooge turning his fortune into digital money, and losing everything after the electricity/power/internet fails. I guess this message is pretty negative from a Bitcoiner point of view. However, it actually is a real risk (without electricity, you can't use bitcoin, see Venezuela). On the other hand, in real life you don't actually *lose* your BTC it if you don't have internet, you just can't access it. Anyway, I stick to my case that's it's really cool that they mentioned BTC in Donald freaking Duck.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:31:33

Do we need this hopium? I was expecting this sub would mainly focus on actual core improvements and other developments in the space, such as Regulations, Bakkt and ETFs. Instead we are all constantly looking for conformation (myself included). This shouldn't be necessary.
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:24:13
Fair point. I can image some people get too greedy and will never sell. Other's get too greedy and sell too early and have regrets... Based on everything you wrote, you seem like a down to earth guy (/girl?) that knows that there's more to life than money. Even if you had no BTC at all, you'll always be much happier than most people in this sub.

I never did it daily. However, I once made some basic excel sheets which simulated DCA'ing every week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6, 8, 12 etc. The best results came from every week and every two weeks, but the difference was VERY insignificant (1-2%). I'd suggest doing it weekly. That saves you a daily visit to your exchange.
After all, the magic of DCA-ing is banning all emotions and minimizing your invested time in (trading) Bitcoin.

I WANT to ignore all price predictions, but it's quite addicting. I want to catch up on the news, but I really need to start limiting myself to max 15-30 minutes a day or something. At some point lurking on becomes so freaking unproductive.

Well, the US may be a bit behind in Bitcoin adoption due regulatory actions, but if they don't actively adopt Bitcoin at some point, they're practically shooting themselves in the face. It just takes some time to accept that the dollar is losing its position as world reserve currency.

After a dot, comes a space. After a dot, comes a space. After a dot, comes a space.
Ontopic: you're right. It's a slow process. I feel like we shouldn't get hyped up because of the price movements, because we still have a long way to go. Also, FOMO is very dangerous at this point, because the price still can go either way.

God damn those YouTube thumbnails are annoying. I don't know boxmining, yet I heard he isn't the absolute worst in the crypto sphere... But fuck this shit.

I recently installed Wasabi and Samourai, just to see how it works (and how well it works). To be honest, as you're relatively new in the space, I think the trezor plenty for now. If the value ever significantly increases, you can always spread your holdings over different wallets. I think especially Wasabi can be a little overwhelming for someone who is completely new. Since you've been involved since November, you could give it a try (just for fun). 
Only if you intend to spend the btc, it would be convenient to send some btc to wallet like Samourai.
Also, make sure your (online) privacy hygiene is up to date and you have a couple backups of your seeds.

Not completely related, but I do respect Warren Buffett with all his years of investing experience and 'cash flow' investing approach A LOT more than Justin fucking Sun. Justin may be on 'our side', but I'm not particularly proud of that...

Words of wisdom.
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:38:49
I think most people here are like you and me. Make sure your overall "privacy hygiene" is on point, but don't overdo it. Andreas Antonopoulos mentioned that most BTC weren't lost because they were stolen, but because they couldn't be retrieved by their original owner.
Be careful with encrypting your passphrase or splitting it up for extra security. Most regular folks, like you and me, aren't the targets of thieves. Just make sure you have a few (identical) copies of your seed. Hide one in your home, give one or two to a family member or good friend, and put one in a fireproof safe somewhere. If your capital increases, you can always split your wealth between two wallets and scatter those seeds.

Hah, that's cool. Donald Duck = Satoshi, no doubt about it!
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:44:29
I really think that if the price drops 2K from any future price, it is considered so 'low', that everyone starts buying in (a.k.a. buying the dip). In this regard, any price under 10K is getting less likely by the day.
On the other hand, I never saw the drop coming from 6K to 3K in 2018, and I didn't see the run from 4K to 12K coming either. Conclusion: **I don't know shit.**
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:21:13
Well, there are some milestones when I will definitely cash out some. I own very little BTC, but if somewhere in the future it's enough to pay of my student debt, I'll definitely use some of that. If the price keeps increasing, I may use it to buy a house. If the price keeps increasing... Well, I don't know yet. I will keep at least 50% always in BTC. As some people say: why would you sell the future for the past? I secretly hope I'll be able to buy that house directly with  BTC. In that case, Bitcoin will be so huge that Satoshi's dream may have come true.

I'm sorry, I'm the wrong person to help you. I have very limited experience with mining.
But successful mining highly depends on your geolocation. If the electricity is cheap and the climate cold, you got yourself a great starting point. If you live in the west, I'm pretty sure buying and holding is the best (if not only?) thing you can do to earn some bucks in the long run.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:07:31
- Option 1: price drops some more, time to accumulate some more!
- Option 2: price consolidates, perfect foundation for future price development
- Option 3: run continues after a short break, no problem, we've got our position.
We can't lose.

I hate the overload of poor memes, but I breathed a bit louder through my nose because of this one. Updoot.

Don't count too much on it. I think that effect only kicks in at 20K, where we have a nice round number, as well as a new ATH.
@_date: 2019-06-18 11:26:36
We shouldn't celebrate this. It may increase adoption in the long run, but this is very alarming news. This makes the whole system more instable, and the results may hurt billions... 
But most people here just care about their 0.015 BTC going to the moon...
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:59:55
Well, if you need to spend your money, you gotta spend it. If I would change some BTC to fiat because I needed it, I won't have any regrets.
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:15:47
So what you're saying is 'it's pretty scarce'. I get your point, but the 'not all millionaires can own one bitcoin' doesn't give enough insight to its true scarcity.

I'll try the recap episodes, thanks!

Hopefully BTC will have broken 20k by then.

Due to economics of scale, I doubt if you can make it profitable (as you're rivaling the big boys). I'd only do it for educational purposes.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:29:09
I know you're saying this sarcastically, but I do believe that's something extraordinary that bitcoin is casually mentioned like this. Remember that 5 years ago, most people never heard of it, and those who did, thought it was still the money of drug addicts, pedophiles and money launderers.

Take a small position, start DCA-ing with small weekly amounts and try not to think of "what could've been".

I'd say the wall street bonus money and the chinese new year TOGETHER have had a bigger impact on the price than the Trump impeachment will ever have.

It's a nice thought. You never lose money working. And in the meantime, my money (a.k.a. Bitcoin) is working for me. No need for checking all the time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:17:04
True, but that's reeks of greed. Whenever I get greedy, I remind myself that Bitcoin can still fail in the long run. Even if that's the case, I got a first class ticket to one of the biggest monetary experiments of our time.

I highly suggest browsing around at as well. Do some research on what bitcoin is and how it works. It's more than a tool to (maybe?) become wealthier.
@_date: 2019-09-27 11:13:02
Ah, I missed that whole discussion. Good to know.
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:37:18
Buddy, no one here knows if it's an good idea. I think and hope so. Also, I did my research so I KNOW Bitcoin is a legit project, but that guarantees nothing. Bitcoin can still fail and will see new crises in the future.
Just take a position you're comfortable with and wait for a long time. It's not hard.
In the meantime, don't check the price and check as little news as possible. I have a few news sources and podcasts that I enjoy, but I really try hard to stay away from all other bitcoin noise.

To what extend is the development of quantum computers a threat to bitcoin? The recently released new about Google's QC doesn't seem too much of threat yet, but 10-30 years from now, it might be possible to start guessing private keys or start mining with an incredible hashrate, Bitcoin seems to be done for. Thoughts?

The rule is that 'buy the dip' is only a valid strategy in a bull market. See ya around.
