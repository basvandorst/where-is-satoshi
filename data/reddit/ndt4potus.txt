I apologize. I appeared that it was working when I posted it. But to honest, I'm a bit of a fish out of water here.

I should just delete this whole thing should I? I got too excited to be in the cool club. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:28:44
Ahh, thank you so much, really. It is the little thing in life...
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:37:53
Thank you so much!
I used the website linked to the game, Blockchain. 
Most of the information I understand on bitcoin is not practical information, but rather the big picture discussions (such as the utilization of Bitcoin where other local currency is failing, benefits of cheap and effective money exchange, and the ability to use denominations that suit your specific needs.  
When it comes to using Bitcoin and the ins and outs, I am as green as it gets.  I did not use an app, but rather a website accessed from my iPad (which admittedly doesn't leave my house). Thanks for taking the time to share the information.

Okay, I'm going to take you up on that. Is there suggested reading (or a video) that you recommend? Should I just start in the sidebar, or is there another source I should check out?
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:42:04
Thank you for the information. I will research your project for sure!

After a while of playing, it will show up in a pop up. I am not sure if it is based on # of games played, duration of time spent playing, or score, to be honest. However I played for maybe 10 min when the first pop up came up. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:49:43
I'm such a dumbass. Hahaha 
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:21:45
Yeah.... No way hahaha I don't have whatever thought processes those girls have that makes them want their naked (or almost naked) bodies on the internet. More power to them though :D

How do I send it? I'll send you this tiny tiny bit I have or whatever it's called for helping me. (Its probably like a hundredth of a penny if that or something) but it will teach me how to send it?

If I can ask you a question, I have followed to prompts for changetip, which seemed almost too simple. How do I connect what I setup through the game and blockchain to whatever I just did on reddit and changetip? Feel free to tell me to go look it up, I am admittedly being a bit lazy here.

Ah, thank you. I feel a little less incompetent  now. I have read a lot, and listened to many hours of conversation (mostly andreas antonopoulos on joe rogan) discussing Bitcoin, But, like anything else, I don't think I can really understand without getting my hands a bit dirty. I honestly never wanted to post here because I found other people's command for the topic intimidating and felt a disconnect from the community; so thanks for much for taking the time to share your information.

1 bit
Is this correct? lol 
By the way, even though I understand it, I'm still amazed that this is real.. if that makes sense... I mean, I just typed a few words and BAM (assuming I am not doing it incorrectly).
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:35:26
I've always been very intellectually interested in cryptocurrency and Bitcoin in particular, but I wasn't exactly sure how to "get" them. I'm actually pretty happy to see a very easy introduction into the experience. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:30:13
hahahaaha I'm laughing envisioning that, ty!
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:29:42
next step will be learning to connect them I guess, in setting up the wallet, i just followed the prompts from the game tbh
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:39:23
No. Haha, forgive me for not correctly expressing myself. I am relatively unfamiliar with the proper vernacular. Now I feel like a fool though, so that's cool. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:06:06
What are you talking about ?
EDIT: I literally have zero websites, nor have I ever been a writer for any news at all, ever. I think I did one day in middle school for our fake tv news, but I'm sure that not a conflict. Story is true, let me know how I can clear this up for you.
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:32:21
Oh dang! Thanks! I promise to share in the same spirit in the future! What a kind community. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:31:44
Thank you. Your advice is helpful. I will look into this. The idea that you could change an address is strange. Also, I don't have a "username" and "password" which feels counter-intuitive still.   
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:24:13
yes I do, but I use Skype for close family and friends.  Thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:32:50
Thank you so much! Not the most graceful entrance, but hey, it is what it is. :D
