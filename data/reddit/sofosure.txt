Hey, great job, I mean, I really like the video, not only its contents but the way it is shot, really dynamic, also how it shows an overview of the place itself and the people who are there, I just found funny how it focus so much in one of them in particular; I didn't really meant it was good or bad because of that (I have no idea about marketing or ad production).

People are calling it "hard fork" but it ain't that "hard" as the one you are suggesting. Right now there's a variable which make blocks not to be accepted if they are bigger than 1MB buuut:
* One year ago there was a bug making this limit even smaller, they fixed and change the limit the actual one, so this kind of fork has been done before (though not intentional).
* It can be done gradual, for instance, new nodes might accept bigger blocks than 1MB but never produce them; once the "new nodes" are no longer new but they are the vast majority, then start with newer nodes which do both, accept and generate, blocks bigger than 1MB. (This was the way it was done before).
* There are several anti-spam measure like this, and they are not always follow exactly the same for every node, (usually they are less strict to accept that what they are to generate) so changing one of this variable is not as hard as changing the mining rules (that what would be need to reduce the confirmation time).
* There are some non-official  nodes already accepting blocks bigger than 1MB.

I wouldn't say period. It is known there're 7000 **full** node running on the **original** P2P network. That doesn't mean there no more servers aware of  transactions, for example some miner are able to check what are the mining (not all of them), you have servers listening the network indirectly through some API (public or private), and you have servers broadcasting transactions using other means a part from the original P2P network (like some light client which listen partially the blockchain). It can not be known how many servers might be I would say.

But why? Is it for the hype or what's the point to use the blockchain for something it wasn't design for?
* If you want a proof of existence, why just not to use a simple hash (maybe containing some historical data)?

* if you just want to store data, why not, let say, use a database?

What he said makes sense and It might be truth to some degree that all that adoption had been exagerated.
On the other hand he is basically saying, dispite it might be really good for them, no-western countries tend to use less western product. Internet was created as as university network in developed countries, yet, most internet users live in china or in india. They might not use twitter, facebook or google, mainly because they are NOT us so they use it in a different way for different cases.
My experience as LBT for some years is that not only speculators, also real users, usually have a completely different view on what is btc useful for and they think their reason to use it is the main reason and the others ones are anecdotic.

Hey! Well most of them are not officially a business, so they won't get a subpoena, actually some of them are running as hidden services under tor and no one knows who run them.
Even in the case the service would been keeping all logs, and giving them directly to Obama, the only thing the service knows is your input and  output btc addresses; if you use several mixing services, as long as there's at least one properly mixing your coins, the other mixing services will have no idea about where the btc went and you'll be safe.

Prices usually change the most the first days of the week (Monday/Tuesday) after then, they usually keep relatively stable till the end of thee week; so, in normal circustancies, start then selling them gradually would have made more sense than rather wait till the last day of the week and when the fiat deposit are usually the lowest (most people can not transfer fiat money during the weekend to the exchanges).

Once it happened to me (and probably to other people as well) that localbitcoin accidentally doubled my account after filling a trade. It seems they sum the filling amount instead of subtracting it, then I tried to get out my "new" coins but it did not let me, then it went down for some hours and once they go up again, everything was as supossed and my "new" coins were no longer there (never had a problem with them again though).......shit happens from time to time, but if they manage to block out transactions, then they can roll back the database and study the logs to set it up as it was supposed.

States can take advantages of the fact people use their currency (either their own citizens or other). Force someone to do something to take advantage from that it is considered inmoral, specially if they are not asked what they do prefer.

Well, it's true centralized systems fit better for some stuff than decentralized ones, and it would be possible to create a much more efficient centralized system than bitcoin (though not that resillient). But that system, sure, is not the current banking system. The banks nowdays rely on millions of millions of crappy COBOL code nobady is sure what it is for or even how can it be changed; it is pretty dificult to do something in a less efficient way than how banks do.

The "core" "oficial" "satoshi" client is controlled by the almighty Bitcoin Fundation, though it is open source they still have lot of controll deciding how the next step should be given...
I think we should encourage other alternative software sources and teams.
Some quite good option could be [the BTCD client]( or the c++ library [libbitcoin]( 
Furthemore, I personally think the official one is worse than those ones for developing new app/systems and this could be making bitcoin enviorement creation slower than it should.

Sorry for use that hard word. But, the blockchain is not the only distribute database; If you are using it instead of another one, you are forcing people to stored your data, I think it is not fair. There are other P2P options if you want, but if it is for that case, I would think the best way would be just  to store them in a pendrive (or replicated at several locations).
Apart from that, I have to admit that what you did is cool :).

What I do is to split the system in differents parts, so, for example, one part might be the one partially deciding which transaction to do, one deciding which set of transaction are posible and another one to execute them. To ilustrate it, let say you have a web store:
-a) Part 'a' store in a db a the tuple (provider/address)
-b) Part 'b' decide to which provider send a tx (not knowing the address)
-c) Part 'c', once 'b' has communicate to which provider send money, it looks up the db to see its address and send it.
(It is suppossed the values of the db are not known to the developers).
This won't prevent you 100% but it will make much easier to spot if someone is doing something nasty. Furthermore, you can isolate some parts from internet reducing the amount of code you have to trust....but there will be always some part you will have to trust, so better pay good money to the developers :)

I think this is a good sign for long time minning viality; There're also tools for avoiding this, spreading quickly the transaction and giving extra tips to the miners, payment process can just make contract with big pools etc....so at the end, even once most of the coins have been mined, there will be always someone giving money to the miners :).

I see...but, who much are they related to the bitcoin foundation? I mean, I don't know but that's something I want to really to know, cause it is important; At least one of them is a member and the another one is being paid by the foundation...in adition, who owns the repository?
Please, don't missunderstand me, those guy are heros for the btc community, and their worked have been great so far...but I'm afraid of the bitcoin foundation, and in addition I think we are making an small group of people too powerfull. Of course, after all, it's a matter of us, we should be more critical and help developing, using and forking alternative sources.

It seems here people really pay to the good ones....but, today for instance, there was this new about the EU deciding how to regulate it, which could be really good or really bad, some people (not me I'm a hodler) prefer to cash out when they are not sure and then cash in once everything is in calm again.

Well, that's depends on how you consider something to be cheap. I mean, you can perfectly argue decentralization add some software constraints that could prevent the software to be more efficient. But software is just a part of it, don't having to ask for permission/paperwork makes it really easier, and therefore cheaper.
It's like torrent, if you count the cost of the torrent network in Kw/h, and you compare to the iTunes platform, the former is much more expensive....still, is cheaper downloading from the torrent network than from iTunes.

Furthermore, you have the block pruned process, where node eliminate no longer useful block entries. (This  is not yet done by most of nodes, but they'll probably do in the future).
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:51:21
That map doesn't have to be really accurate, for example, I (living in Germany) run a node for myself and another one for a client's service (the client is from England). But both nodes are hosted in Virginia.

you said the competing clients are not really for used, well actually that disturb me a bit cause I was just thinking about using btcd from conformal for a project, buuut, do you think that can be problematic? 
The thing is the "oficial" one lacks a way to set up notifications (I did not find it), and even there are other solutions for setting up notifications you have to rely on an external server (even if it can be trusteable it can get down as blockchain.info had several times). It would be possible of course use several servers, and system so it is more reliable, but that would also be quite more difficult to program :s

I've always booked plane tickets and hotels with Destinia using bitpay and never got a problem. That said, I also use bitpay for other stuff like namecheap and never had a problem neither, till last month. I paid bitpay and they showed up I paid, but it did not show up on namecheap, I spoke with their customer service and 2 days later the problem was solved. It seems from time to time companies have problem with their payment solution integration, but:

Yes you can...but you need to rely on the bank, you need to open an acount there, and then you need to worry what they would think about your money. 
I personally, living in germany but not speaking fluent german, am always worry about my bank, they send me letters from time to time with enourmous paragraph written in german which I can't barely understand making me feel I'm doing something wrong. They know all my personal data and I sure they'll use it.

The current micro-transaction channel protocol, rely on txid not being malleable, but it is, so either they fix that or find a new micro-transaction protocol. (It also use the time lock what makes them "not standard").
I think it could be done just adding that information as an extra parameter on the payment url, and let each wallet developer manage their way how to deal with recurring billing.
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:13:50
were there any doubts?
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:55:54
I guess there's no standard way to do that, though, you could show the hashed script, and then use some of the public keys involved in that script (for instance if it is a 2-3 payment, then sing with two of those keys).
@_date: 2014-09-27 03:23:37
If all their outputs are big enough then almost always, yes; but if not, it might get included later on, forgotten or cancel (double spended by yourself), depending on who have discovered the block.
In addition there's a trick: If a transaction does not include fee but it is used as input for a transaction paying fee enough, then both transactions will be record in the next block with high chances.

Well, it actually says the opposite, credit cards company will not be free to charge whatever they decide to charge (0.3% will be the upper limit). So it won't be the case some business will not accept creddit cards, but creddit cards might not accept some business (well, the amount of business they current accept will decrease). But yes, at the end, one way or another it will be positive for the btc.
@_date: 2014-10-19 04:38:43
If bitcoin were the only currency, or the main one, that would be true, an increase of useful transaction would reduce market cap of the economy (including other currencies, stocks, etc); But probably the increase of bitcoin transactions does not represent an increase of transaction in the "surrounding bitcoin" economy, just that a greater percentage of the transactions that would be anyways been done, are done in bitcoin instead of fiat, and this is because, for most bitcoiners, fiat is still more useful for them than btc.
I mean, the concept of velocity of money is applied to economies and not to currencies. So in order bitcoin to affect its value because of its velocity, it would have to affect the surrounding economy, and as it is used globally, it would have to change the global economy aaaaand, I think it is a bit too soon for that to be significant.
Another different thing might be, that now, some people who were saving money could stop saving and start spending decreasing scarcity.

@_date: 2014-10-11 17:35:17
Ah! Now I got what you mean. 
Well, not only the coinbase will differ but also the block's hash...even if they had the same size and transactions and timestamp, they would have a different nonce and therefore different hash so, they would be considered different blocks, and there would be a brief fork till another block is found and append to some of them.
So back to your question, yes, they would be different blocks.
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:12:06
I would be if no one were looking at it, but as we count it as something important, there might be people manipulating this data.
In addition, am I the only one a bit afraid of this? There could be 3 reasons:
* It is being used more (Great).
* Some people trying to fake data for speculation (neither good nor bad).
* An attack attempt (Could be quiet bad).
I don't think an attack would destroy btc, but that doesn't mean it could not be really painful :s. There are several improvement on the way to help scaling btc, but they'll take a while to be full operative and we might need some trial and error....

That is an anarchist squad house which was railed by anti-terrorist police operation (just like many other squad houses in barcelona). That operation had nothing to do with bitcoin, the people living there said it was a symbolic action against freedom movements in general. (It is not said, but Amir was not living there when this happened). It ends up by the reporter saying something like that bitcoin is a double edged sword, and that it was developed there (WTF?!).

They did something like that in Spain, electronic id (dni electronico); it was like a normal EU Id card, plus an electronic chip on it which can hold a private key, in addition there is an official government agency to issue public key (among other things), in spannish called "real casa de la moneda y timbre".
The result, as far as I observed, completely useless, as it was a government idea, everything went over complicated and over bureaucratic. I had to use my official signature once for some official documents I had to sign but I could not as I was abroad... managing bureaucracy was a nightmare...and at the end the agency from where I need to sign did not accept it just because they did not know how....so finally I sent all the documents to a close friend and ask her to fake my hand signature.....

Some wallets might store the UTXO (a.k.a, the data use to compute yout bitcoin balance) as used even when it did not finally got into a block. If you import the keys again into a different wallet,this case armory, it would be like pressing the "restart" button.
Some wallets might offer a "rescan the transaction history" option so you don't have to do this trick, but might not be the case of blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:13:29

In general true but, the biggest arbitrage opportunities are between exchanges that are currently under problems or that are not that well known. Also, to do arbitrage you must break the rule "only deposit what you are gonna sell"....so, there's no free lunch at the end.

That's not true. Check out the transaction format. There might be good reason not to do that, but from those are not the ones you commented. 
You could, for instance, represent the hashes from former already in blockchain transactions, with the number of the block they are plus an offset; using just this reference and the input's signature for each input, and for each output just an amount and address,  could reduce it under 1/4 of what they are now. 
Again, I'm not saying it would be a good idea compressing them, but it is possible. (Actually Gavin's  hash tables idea makes more sense).
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:58:38
Hi, my apologies, I shouldn't have said it was not true, it is indeed not very effective with gzip I guess.
Anyway, the link you used there, includes only transaction hashes, but the message peers actually send each other [contains full transactions]( And also, it would be possible to avoid using hashes in most cases, using other means to reference former transactions.
But I agree with you, I don't think is  a good solution to modify the protocol this way (maybe just for some non standard nodes collaborating with each other).
I think one simple solution (yet maybe not enough), is changing the way default fee is applied to take into account not just the tx size, but how many UTXO is using versus how many is creating, and if it would be possible to purge an entire old tx as it has no UTXO left afterwards.

Yea, it can boost industrial production and exportation but that means nothing, we could also increase industrial production and exportation if we randomly slaver the 35% of our population.
