You can fix stupidity, what you can't fix is being open to challenging your opinions, and helping people change it.

Long term picture of cryptos in general.
If you look at the S-curves of any big technological advances, there was a considerable advantage for the first products in the market, but they did not all the time own the market a few years down the road.

I want people here to bring back self awareness on the table. It is actually what makes things move forward, more than not questioning anything and just getting the progress you can.

Disagree, we need our goverments to better spend their money. We could have the same performances in our services (hospitals, administration, army...) with much lower taxes.
But that is so off subject from the post.

If he thinks it's the right time to buy 150k worth of bitcoin, suggesting he would be capable of trading altcoins is pure bollocks.

For the footprint, I do agree that other things can consume much more, but that's not really an answer. If bitcoin is to be used as a currency by the majority of the population the number of miners will have to be in the hundreds times more. And then it might become a problem if done not responsibly.
High fees will be reduced hopefully thanks to stuff like Segwit indeed!
And I do not know much about the coding aspect, thanks for the details! 
Just one thing though, is every extra layer added centrally by bitcoin themselves, or is it up to the services like to implement it themselves to their systems?

That's the problem.
You guys are just looking for one preacher, one that will tell you what you want to hear.
I'm all in for discussing bitcoin, like he's doing. But never on earth is it healthy to just fixate on one guy and his perspective. HE might be a crypto visionnaire or something along those lines lol, but he's not Jesus. There is so much none of us are aware about bitcoin, including his non omniscience, and so much unpredictability, for anyone to trust anyone's advice blindly.

Tell him that he can do whatever the fuck he wants but only after the 18th.
And tell him that spending a big portion of his savings (assume it is) and putting it all in the same basket is beyond moronic, defos be harsh with him, and if he doesn't listen to you then you'll have a bunch of witnesses to say that you did indeed warn him, so you don't get fucked by the outfall of the situation.

Hahaha totally fair enough, just here to spread some awareness.
Reddit is one big echo chamber and it has been so ridiculous here the past couple of days.

Make it worthwhile to have it as a currency. 
Better utility = instant higher demand
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:02:39
If he wants to buy for the mid-long term he absolutely needs to wait for the whole 10-18 December thing to settle down, no matter what crypto-currency.

It is not practical for now indeed, and there is actually a fucking huge energetic footprint because of all the needed bitcoin mining (to mine new bitcoin and as the only way to confirm the transactions).
The fees for small transactions are too high, and the current bitcoin ecosystem (especially with whats happening in the current days), will favor big transactions that will make big miners loads of money (it also is progressively getting harder and harder for miners to mine, 80% of all bitcoins will be mined by next year). The only way for miners (who basically make bitcoin function) to make money will be with transaction fees.
(But then how will the goverments impose taxes on crypto? That is also a big problem)
Basically for now there is absolutely no way that bitcoin can be used as a fully practical currency (for now once again). But bitcoin will get better.
Another problem is that bitcoin's coding works right now, but modifying it will be extremely hard to do, since billions of dollars will be at stake.
So bitcoin might not be able to innovate that much. 
It works for now, but other cryptos can and will be more practical, and will steal a fair amount of the crypto market share, since bitcoin will not be able to keep up with the innovations.

I agree 100% with you, really do. Bitcoin's tech is miles ahead of any other crypto.
My point is that it is like that, but FOR NOW.
Who knows who's innovating what right now in their basement/governmental facility? If you can be absolutely be sure of one thing is that people are trying to develop new crypto tech right now, and some will be game changing, not all of it will go to bitcoin.
Not an expert nor do i pretend to be, but there is too much to consider to get the long term big picture.

I'll upvote it since i legit can't figure out if this is sarcasm or not
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:52:03
How about you challenge your ideas by yourself?
Not my fucking job.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:06:08
It is a success story, for the right or wrong reasons.
I do not hesitate a single second that crypto is going to be huge long term wise, but no one, absolutely no one, will know if Bitcoin is going to be the winning one, and how its value will evolve.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:39:41
There are reasons to believe that crypto currency is going to be a huge controversial subject in economic/politics. So many regulations are going to be put in place, including with central banks. 
The only thing that could help cryptos is if at least one currency completely fails, that would incentivise people to invest in crypto no matter the legality of it.
