I read that as USSR. For a short moment, my mind was *blown*.

With Blockchain :(What's the trouble, exactly? Maybe it's something that could be worked out? I remember there was trouble until it was integrated with "Wallet", maybe it's some kind of misunderstanding again?

It's gotta be the worst chart in the world ;)
None of the axis labeled, no scale. Also, probably made in Excel.

To the turtles, then!

Here you go. Integrates with built-in Wallet app, lets you choose between coinbase or blockchain.info.

Apple Anything makes everything else look like shit... during the Keynote Event. That's marketing &amp; manipulation at it's finest, they do this *every single time*. How stuff works in real life - thats an entirely different matter. Siri is a great example: marketed as if it was at least IBMs Watson, in real life, well, not so good.
Did you notice how at their video comparison every step of physical cc payment was the slowest possible? Card failed to sweep the first time, wallet buried at the bottom of the handbag, hesitation "which card to choose", etc. Apple Pay? Beep, finished. No taking out the phone. No failed fingerprint sweeps. No card selection in-app. And on the AppleWatch - what about the fingerprint sensor?

Very nice app. 
Suggestion: a price ticker and/or chart widget for ios8 would be perfect.

If he did as he planned he probably made ~100% profit.

Isn't that the point that it's easy to get confused?

I cannot disagree, they definitely _are awesome_. But I'm aware that my engineering background makes my view on that distorted.
I've already been in situations I rolled my eyes because people don't intuitively get SI prefixes/suffixes. And thats in continental Europe, while knowing only mm/m/km and none of the inch/yard/mile/kettle/whatever stuff. 
It just has to be accepted it just _is_ confusing. Definitely more confusing that dollar/cent metaphor OP is hinting at.

Soo... a thousand blocks to process a single byte?
I love it how people of scream all the time how mBTC as a widely used name for a currency unit is perfect and will never be mistaken with anything by anyone, because it's SI, yet even here...
