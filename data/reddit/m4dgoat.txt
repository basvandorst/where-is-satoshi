Thank you for your thoughtful response. 
The use of crypto to restrain machines is an interesting one...
The idea that the blockchain is immutable is something that could bring enormous value to society. Imagine having the laws of robotics coded onto the blockchain.

Well, obviously it will be the AI hunter killer.

Do you think Bitcoin is more suited for machines or humans?
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:13:11
A mere $250 million will produce the same hashrate as the current Bitcoin network. (at $400 per petahash)
@_date: 2015-06-29 01:27:38
What is your take on the block size increase? are you for or against it?

I am new and just starting to learn about bitcoin. I think the tip from Diapolis just push me over. I just learned how to tip others. I want to tip people who has not been exposed to bitcoin before and hope it will encourage them to look into it.

Bitcoin is useful and therefore valuable to different people for different reasons. Some find value in its' low transaction fees, others like its' ability to transact without borders, still some value it for its' hard limit or Anonymity or its' censorship resistance quality and so on...
What I am saying is that for whatever reason that value is. It fundamentally has to be stored securely first and foremost. Without the security to store all those values that brings people to Bitcoin. It is pointless.

Just completed a transaction with $0.24 fee. it was confirmed in 11 minutes.
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:09:26
This could be worth a lot.

All old coins and large transactions does not require to have a fee attached. How is this determined? Is it up to the discretions of each miner or is it coded into the protocol?

@_date: 2015-07-13 13:13:17
So, how can an novice user determine if his/her transaction has high priority or not?
@_date: 2015-09-17 01:52:25
One person having control of so many coins?  That's just silly in the age of multisig.

"Decentralized Security". Could not agree more.

I have come to the realization that I would rather have more people run the network(full node) than join the network.
