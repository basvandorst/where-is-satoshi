The world financial system isn't insecure enough to justify that, and the fact that you would be using green energy doesn't mean you wouldn't be wasting it.

Okay, so you were lying a minute ago when your said that the problem was security. And it's my issue because you have a moral imperative to spend your energy on something more worthwhile, and so I have an imperative to ensure that you do that.

Capitalism existed before we dropped the gold standard just fyi

This isn't true
  
Also gold isn't hard to transport. You know they aren't literally lugging around bars of gold whenever it's sold, right? It's stored in a central location and when it's transferred from one person to another they just update their records.

Again, that's not a transportation problem. I don't like that my car will get towed if I park it illegally, but that doesn't mean that cars are slow.

Yeah it would be difficult if you manually transported the gold whenever you wanted to exchange it, but again that's not how gold is exchanged. It's exchanged with banks as a medium. Cars would be slow if you insisted on pushing them down the freeway by hand, but that's not how cars are used.

Okay, but again, that means that there isn't a transportation problem with gold, because we don't do it in the expensive troublesome and slow way.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:14:28
That's not the same as transportation difficulty. In fact they're completely unrelated.

I hate to be the one to tell y'all, but we've actually had near instantaneous money transfer over the internet for a while now. That particular future came about 25 years ago
