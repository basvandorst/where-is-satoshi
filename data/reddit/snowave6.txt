I realize this would vary greatly from client to client, but what % of someone's portfolio do you suggest should be Bitcoin/Bitcoin related?
Modest %?
Standard %?
Agressive %?

I know its pretty widely known, but there was a 10,000 bitcoin offer that came onto bitstamp about ~30 mins before Karpeles resignation news made it out.  Not that many hold 6.5 million in bitcoin, let alone want to liquidate immediately.  Also, not many people who don't care about pushing the market down/not patient enough to get paid at his offer (he was slowly getting paid, holding the market down singlehandedly), i can attach a chart in comments if anyone wants.  Just seemed pretty conspicuous.

Thinking about moving some btc from bitstamp to bitfinex.
Could anyone with experience with Bitfinex give me an analysis of the exchange risk there?

Is this the best thing to have on the front page for Bitcoin?

If Bitstamp wants to continue being an exchange of any integrity, they'll handle cases like yours with professionalism.

how come you're getting rid of it?

Mining is a bet on slowly increasing mining difficulty or even decreasing difficulty.  Since mining difficulty has decreased (which at one point was expected never to happen), the margin on mining has grown.  One of the advantages of mining bitcoin in a less than ideal difficulty setting is that you can accumulate a large amount of bitcoin without moving/signaling the market.  However, in the current mining difficulty setting, you generate more bitcoins.. I haven't done the analysis but probably enough to generate and lock in an immediate profit.

When Bitcoin does reach structural capacity in blocks, fees will be needed in order to make transactions.  While its simple logic that higher fees will affect adoption, it is not logical that all the other values of Bitcoin will be forgotten if transaction fees become more than insignificant.  Bitcoin isn't trying to be visa or paypal.  To quote Nick Szabo, "That means that large-B Bitcoin (the blockchain) will evolve into a high-value settlement system: as it grows it won't turn into a big moving van carrying many more pieces of paper (transactions per second); instead it will be an armoured car that can carry higher denominations (higher value per transaction). That means we will need other systems to do small-b bitcoin (the currency) retail payments." 
Higher transaction fees are not the end of Bitcoin and the effect on adoption will be negligible.

maybe this friend you speak of isn't bringing dollars for fuel, but he's bringing a new transmission.  Bitcoin is a festival of the commons, every value added to the network is gained by all.  Chain is providing solutions for any company to more optimally perform important procedures on the blockchain in a drastically more cost effective, secure and transparent manner.  It makes the network more valuable.  They DON"T care about the price of bitcoin, they care about the VALUE of the network.  Price will take care of itself.  Don't shit on the bitcoin parade because you got hurt trading it.

@_date: 2013-12-03 18:12:59
Thats the same as saying:
Someone who owns a controlling share of a company (51%) wants to sell his portion of the company.  This would be a bad sign for the stock and probably create negative speculation against it.  It would also increase the amount of supply of stock available =&gt; decrease in price.
But that is not to say that there is no one who wants to buy all (or part of) the 51% share of the company.
Sure, if some big dude wants to sell a bunch, its not great for the price, but that doesn't suggest a failure of the currency by any means.
The currency is as strong as its user base and/or marketplace.  Many would say btc is still in its infancy, and the demand for it has only just began to grow.
