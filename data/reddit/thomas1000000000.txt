You are still assuming that not even a single listening node in China is connected to the outside through other means (VPN or something similar).


As soon as they are online again (which won't take long. Miners lose money every day they are offline and will look for a solution immediately), the longest valid chain will be accepted by all nodes --&gt; no fork but some orphan blocks.


As long as it is not online, Ethereum has no LN. With code you can never forecast the exact date. Look at SegWit: It was supposed to be ready by April but wasn't finished until November. The same will be with the hardfork purposal: It is supposed to be ready by July but you can never know when the devs are finished.
Then there is testing. They have to test it. As I don't follow Ethereum and Ethereum forked anymore, I don't know if they have already tested it or not or even what specifics their LN has

In a centralised system (=Ethereum with Proof of Vitalik), this happens. In a decentralised system, the original chain will have the name Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-02-27 14:08:57
They could but it is uncertain, Bitcoins could also be worth much less and then you will have a problem. I don't believe Bitcoins will be worth less but you never know and therefore I used current prices. I also don't know how the price per kWh or the power consumption of mining hardware will change, which would have made any estimates for the worth of the mining equipment baseless.
@_date: 2017-02-10 20:12:40


Current implementations need SegWit (or at least a malleability fix) and have to be tested before people can use them. As I am not working on an implementation of LN nor am I paying the devs, I can't complain that it is not ready yet.


Yes, AFAIK that can happen.


Who says Bitcoin won't be the first? Do you know of any other coin with an implementation of a working LN (and I don't mean testnets designed only for LN but coins with value)? I don't, but if one exists I stand corrected.


If one node in China is connected to one node from the rest of the world, mining will continue without problems (that is the way Bitcoin was designed). If there is no connection to the rest of the world (which is very, very, very, very unlikely), it will take a maximum of 6 weeks until the next difficulty retargeting takes place (assuming that there is only 33% of the mining power outside of China, though I believe the percentage is higher).


I don't think so. Worst case the network can handle 1 TX/sec, the fees will be higher and people will think twice about making their transaction (fees will most likely be thrice as high --&gt; nothing to worry about, 45 cent  per transaction on average for censorship resistant money is cheap). Therefore, I don't think the price will be affected much and certainly not tank.
You are too focused on the price, 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC (maybe someday it will be 1 BTC + 1 ForkedBTC but that is not certain).

With softforks you have a choice, with evil softforks you do not (but an evil softfork is a hardfork in my opinion). You can use the new features or not, softforks are designed the way that you do not have to upgrade and you have no risks if you do not upgrade --&gt; you are not forced to do anything
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:52:43


You should really look at the hashrate. Even if it is true that ViaBTC and BTC.TOP are controlled by the AntPool guy (which I really doubt), you will get 41% (with F2Pool-guy being the second person). You should check before you post something or write how you calculate your numbers.


Who said anything about SegWit? Even though it is a nice change and enables further scaling solutions, many are happy with a blocksize of 1MB and do not want to or can't download/upload bigger blocks.
If consensus does not exist within the community, you can either say it is not needed or fork the chain. Everybody has to decide for themselves what they want

Not really. AFAIK over 30% of mining is in Georgina, some % is in Iceland and a little bit in other countries.


Miners are our slaves and can be fired, they have no real power. If they decide to misbehave, they can fuck off.


Don't know what that is but I can't imagine Bitcoin going to be toast for any reason other than a major flaw in SHA256. This flaw has to be really big, otherwise encryption will be changed in a few days with no real losses occurring.


Not really. I do not see a 10% drop as one country responsible for the price. Of course, they have a certain influence on it but nothing else (10% drop and 1.3 billion people --&gt; the drop is about right if you consider that they didn't ban Bitcoin completely)
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:59:22
I didn't know that, nice. How many transaction will fit in a block with Schnorr and Signature Aggregation on average? (Assuming 3,33 tx/s or 2000 tx/block is the average now)
@_date: 2017-02-13 14:33:27
No. Even if you used the same address over and over again, you would normally have 2 outputs (1 output is the change back to the same address and the other output is the amount you send somebody else).
1 input and 1 output happens only, if someone spends the whole amount he received (which is very rare).
E.g. I send you 1 BTC and after that you send  1 BTC to your neighbor --&gt; you spend my TX as input completely and your TX has only 1 input and 1 output.
But if you only send 0.5 BTC to your neighbor, you would have 2 outputs --&gt; 1 for your neighbor and 1 for yourself (=this is the change and can either be a new address or the your input address).
If change addresses didn't exist and addresses had a balance, your neighbor could simply take the signature + public key and broadcast them to the network again, thus steling 0.5 BTC. But fortunately, Bitcoin has no balances and only UTXOs (=Unspent Transaction Outputs), which can only be spent completely or not at all --&gt; therefore change addresses are requiered and transactions with 1 input and 1 output happen very rarely.
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:31:13
Most likely his own calculations: 12.5/2/2/2=1.5625 BTC/block, which is 1/10th of the current mining reward. Of course, we don't actually need all the hash power and 1/10th could be enough but the more hash power we have the more expensive it is to make a 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-02-13 07:36:29
8,6 even: 1,000,000/192/600=8,68 Transactions per second if every transaction only had 1 input and 1 output

You can either make it with an evil softfork or with a pegged side-chain. An evil softfork is not really a softfork (in my opinion) and with a pegged side-chain you would not effect the main chain, it is a second layer and opt-in (and can be done as a softfork). I don't know of any other ways a softfork could change the 21M limit (You could reduce it if miners would underpay themselves like in [block 
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:38:14

Under what name will they show up on [ I read in another post "Satoshi:0.14.0 with BIP148" (or something similar) but I am not sure because no listening node appears to have that name yet (could be because it was only relased some hours ago).


Nice to know that people take the initiative to do something (I decided to wait some days before upgrading and let other people test it - mostly to compare hashes). Are there some lists with hashes already online (from different people on different sites)? I saw one in another post but nothing else
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:38:44


That is unlikely and would currently take 2000 years. If you make a hardfork to increase the blocksize, you can simply use the UTXO as a sort of spendable genesis block.

What about a list of different possible PoW algorithms and current miners signal which one they want to have in the next release. As people could produce enough ASICs in 12 months to have more than 51% hashrate, the signaling could be done in two steps.
1.) After one month the miners signal for different algos and the best five win (number can be changed).
2.) After nine months miners begin signaling for a second time and one algo out of the five wins (I don't know if three months are enough for developers to write code, test it, and for the community to run it).
The second step would prevent future miners from having enough time to produce ASICs and therefore enough hashrate to signal for the current algo again (without step 2 they would have twelve months, now they only have four).
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:54:20

Because they would not have existed otherwise. Nowadays companies make transactions with many outputs and not with simply two and therefore they have to pay less fees. This reduces the load for the network because in the past they made a single transaction for every request they got --&gt; nowadays they are more efficient because there is only one change address, where the rest of the UXTO goes, and not many

I believe they have to pay somewhere around 0.04$/kWh or they get power for free and have to give a percentage of the profits to the powerplant owner


Yes, it is way too much and many people agree with you. The network would be secure if it had 1/5th of the current hashrate (it could be stable with even less)


Putting more transactions into each block (i.e. by filling all the blocks up to the brim and not leaving some partly empty) won't magically increase the number of transactions people make (maybe there will be some transactions people would not have made because of higher fees but these transactions are unefficient and are thankfully avoided).

Maximum is 1,000,000/191/600 = 8.7 tx/s. This only works with the assumption that every transaction has only one input and one output.
Average is around 2,000 tx/block, which means 3.3 tx/s

They charge the fee but if everybody paid around 50 sat/byte, would miners ignore the 0.5 BTC per block? Of course they won't.


You forget that we can hardfork anytime we want. Of course, the price will fall but Bitcoin won't die because of this.


Rising prices also mean more miners because they calculate in dollars/yuans, not bitcoins. And again, we always have the option of doing a hardfork, which will meand that this attacker will lose around 500 million dollars.

They require a soft fork (which is a fork). You most likely meant "Smaller blocks do not require a hard fork."

@_date: 2016-11-06 17:20:00


True, only that miners don't exactly sell anything. Simply because some miners charge more sat/byte does not mean that all miners do or that the users are willing to pay a higher rate.


The community (or at least everybody of the community who does not want to get his funds stolen by the attacker). Voting is easy, one dev team forkes the chain. If you want to be part of that new chain, you are, if you not, you are not.


Yes. The problem with that calculation are the drops in mining rewards every four years (the next 3-4 will be significant, the ones from then on won't really matter).


That's impossible. You could try scamming someone for 1 BTC and it does not cost you 1 BTC.
I don't know what you mean by that to be honest.


Doesn't have to be. I saw u/theymos posting that 1/4 of the current hashrate is enough and I agree with him.
But it will most likely happen. As long as miners see that they could make a profit, they will buy hashing power and mine. If the price is twice as high as it is now, the hashrate will most likely be twice as high.
And you are assuming that the attacker could simply power up 1,9 Exahashes from one day to the other one and no one will notice anything. That could happen in theory but not in reality

For me, holding one of three private keys is too much.
Of course they still need to get the second private key to move the funds. But someone hacking can the exchange can still get all Bitcoins because the exchange has one private key and the foundation will sign the transaction with their key.
@_date: 2016-09-11 06:26:13
Yes, it changed with the new beta wallet, which is now the main wallet (I believe since March or April 2016). The old one had more words (could be 17, I don't know but they were more than 12), now 12.
Unfortunately, I can't help you get your funds back. The above is all I know regarding this. But your funds are not lost, you simply need a way to get them with that passphrase back.
EDIT: I googled and they removed the legacy wallet from their site but they still have the source code on their [Github page]( --&gt; scroll down untli you see "[(Legacy) Blockchain Wallet]( which is the third last
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:17:21
That's not what I meant.
For example, some exchanges are paying out their Bitcoins as soon as they get a request. That means that they sometimes have e.g. 20 individual transactions per block.
My idea is that the 20 individual transactions should be done in one transaction with 20 outputs.
I know that this could be done by reprogramming their sending APIs but not all kind of long chain transactions are done by exchanges.
If the miners would ignore all addresses that spend their input in the same block that they got them by altering the parent transaction, that would save some transaction size
@_date: 2016-09-05 18:53:18


If people can't take insults, they are not worth it in my opinion. If they don't recognise the potenital of Bitcoin, then that's their problem, not ours. In the future they will lokk back and think: "Why was I not more open-minded back then?"

But if the full nodes and the miners are configured to ignore the inputs to addresses which spend their input in the same block. This last transaction could be added to the parent transaction.

This is true because blocks aren't full yet, they have on average 750 KB ([look at the average blocksize]( And I would say that transactions are more around 1500 per block the last few months. That means that there is 1/4 of blocks free and that would be the last 500 transactions, meaning that on average there are 2000 transactions per blocks

2.) use small transactions (see explanation above)
4:) You could use a coin mixer like [bitmixer.io]( or you can wait for [Schnorrs Signature]( which will come soon and enable [CoinJoin](
6.) Be careful about recommendations from other people - they have the coin they will recommend you and are waiting for a pump or they are frustrated because they are bag-holders (they bought high and the price fell). Do your own research if you want to invest in altcoins.

Only because the price is high doesn't mean that people have more money to trade. The commission would still be the same.
@_date: 2016-09-05 19:16:24
If you have $1000, you will get:
* 2BTC at a price of $500, at 1% commission the exchange will get 0.02BTC or $10
* 1BTC at a price of $1000, at 1% commission the exchange will get 0.01BTC or $10
For me, they get the same commission in dollars but at a cheaper price they get more commission in BTC.


It is exactly the opposite

I don't know how it is in the US but in Europe the money on your bank account belongs legally to the bank, not you. The only thing you have is a promise that they will give you that money back.

Suppose you had 10,000 BTC in one address and use it to buy something for 1 BTC where you have to register and provide data about yourself. The seller now knows that you have 10,000 BTC, he knows where you live, he could attack you and demand you give him your BTC.
If you instead had 5 BTC on 2000 different addresses and buy something for 1 BTC, the seller can only see that you have 5 BTC, not an amount for which he would risk attacking and robbing you.


Your information is only known to the seller and also only if you buy something for which he has to know your personal data

You give way too much power to the foundations. Who guarantees that they won't publish the amount of bitcoins one company has? Why should they have control over one private key?
You are destroying free markets, in your scenario everbody has to submit to the power of these foundations. This is only a change of power from the exchanges to the foundations, the hacking problem wouldn't be solved.
EDIT: Furthermore, you would prevent new companies from accepting Bitcoins because the community would shun them if they did not publish their money reserves, which they most likely do not want. It would be more convenient for them to integrate another payment system.

There are 3 empty blocks in the last 2 days and there are ~250 full blocks. The average blocksize in the last two days is ~0,82MB per block. If you don't count the empty blocks, the average filled block is 0,82 + 3 / 250 * 0,82 = 0,828MB. So NOT 85-90%.

If you look at the amount of people (at least those with port 8333 open), you can see that 30% have upgraded to 0.13.0 in two months, meaning it would take maybe 1 year for everyone to upgrade and 4 months for 50% to upgrade --&gt; increase to 1,35 MB in 4 months.

You have to read the post before mine. 10% hashing power means that the coin is worth 1/10th. Otherwise miners would be stupid for mining a coin where the reward is lower (which won't happen).

I know that, I meant the perfect average for a transaction to confirm is 5 minutes.
An example (assuming a block gets mined every 10 min):
Directly after the last block I send my first transaction. Expected confirmation time: 10 min
Five minutes later I send my second transaction. Expected confirmation time: 5 min
Directly before the next block is mined I send my third transaction. Expected confirmation time: 0 min
On average you have a confirmation time of 5 min in my example. The same happens in reality, only with more transactions

Two days already passed and they still have less hashrate. I don't think that has much to do with bad luck, they really lost part of their hashrate.

If we are already at the topic of the creation of Bitcoin, what led Satoshi to leave the project? I read many of his posts and he never really wrote about leaving before he really left. Any early adopters who have a good insight on his reasons? The only thing I found was this post: [

Now they have 7%, not that much more. That's less than their 12% from before and the hashrate that could give them 12% they claim they still have.

There are 3 empty blocks in the last 2 days and there are ~250 full blocks. The average blocksize in the last two days is ~0,82MB per block. If you don't count the empty blocks, the average filled block is 0,82 + 3 / 250 * 0,82 = 0,828MB. So NOT full.

If the rest of the coins (the other 90%) go to my address, I am on board.
Just joking.

Nope, a minority as you can see by the amount of nodes, blocks and by comparing the number of readers at r/bitcoin and at r/btc

What does that have to do with my question?
@_date: 2016-10-07 14:20:25


By reading the page he linked? It doesn't load up for me at the moment but as far as I can remember, this article mentions theymos saying that there are around 40k nodes.
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:02:48
And they do care, as you can see by the adoption rate of 0.13.0
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:45:29


It is possible.
You could for example do this: You need two different addresses. On the legacy chain you send all your Bitcoins to address 1 and on the BIP148 chain to address 2. You should wait until you have a confirmation for both transactions, otherwise you could still lose your coins.
Problem solved (you can also do it in other ways but this one is the most simple one).
@_date: 2016-10-06 06:06:21
Depends on how much limit you set for yourself. To change the limit you have to go to the bank (some even let you do it online and whenever and how often you want). The standard limit is ~450$ where I live but you can raise it to ~2000$ without problems and even higher if you want.

It is more like a promise from the bank that they will pay you back. Therefore, the term "owe" is too strong.

Well, you can look at the different user profiles and look who was here at the beginning and is still active, which are 3 - 4 people in the first 50 who registred at bitcointalk.org. Here they are:
[He is online from time to time] (
[He sold his Bitcoins early] (
[theymos] (
[He is not what I would call active] (
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:08:05
That's their official site, nothing I would trust. It is more likely that they lost part of their hashrate and do not have bad luck.
@_date: 2016-10-02 17:45:41


I will do that.


And my advice to you: You should start showing your hate, it is completly normal to hate things (like terrorists - did you get the joke?)


More based on hate, not on fear. They are far away from me (thankfully) but I still hate them.


I don't know what you mean with that to be honest.

And on the oter hand, I can create 10000 Bitcoin Core nodes. If you assume that the percentage of people doing this is the same for every client, you get a good representation.

In my country too. But that didn't stop the government from only paying  back ~54% if you had money under 100.000 (I am from Austria if you want to know). That means that the insurence is only on paper but doesn't really exist

A loud minority even.
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:17:34


Did you ever hear something about fees? You know, the thing you pay miners to include you into a block. If you set the fee right, your transaction will be in the next block.


You answered it yourself: There are days when the blockchain is not so full.


I don't see it harming the economy. The price is rising, the userbase is getting bigger and bigger every day, SegWit is here (and will be active in Jannuary, if all the miners agree), LN is getting better and will also be released some time in the near future. I only see positvie things.

They don't pay out the money, as described by someone else some posts above this one (and I have read that many times, from different sources). That means that the 10 days are in reality not 10 days but infinite time.

Because that's one guy (or possibly Mt.Gox) moving some "smaller" amounts and the big amounts are going to their own return address, which is always a different one.

But you will lose your money if the bank goes bankrupt (ever wondered why it is called "bankrupt"?). If an exchange e.g. goes bankrupt, you won't lose your Bitcoins (if you store them on your own PC + backups, like any sensible person should do)

They are not very reliable. His transaction has to wait for the other ~31.000 transactions with higher fees than his to clear up (which will hopefully never happen). His best option is to resend the funds.

It will reach around 90%. But I agree with the rest of your statement.

Yes, I use Bitcoin Core


Yes, it is an HD wallet


Well, I moved the coins to addresses I have created earlier which should solve that problem for now (I have numbered them so I know for sure which one I have to use next)

Try what?
Receive coins on one chain and publish the raw transaction on the other chain, yes. But that won't only happen on Aug 1, that could happen weeks later if there are still two chains.
People sending two different transaction to different addresses to protect themselves, I'm not sure but I hope they are intelligent enough to do this (or protect themselves in another way)

Totally agree with that, I simply wanted to point out that there could be spammers trying to create big blocks


I don't know about other wallets but mine is ready for segwit.


I think it depends on the fees you can save but yes, it will take time and happen slowly


Which is still 3x as big as now, I am betting on smaller blocks (maybe 1.7MB or something)


It is really surprising how much time some people need to upgrade, I mean there are still people using Windows XP.....


Didn't see that one but I will google and read it sometime in the next days. Thanks for the info.

In the mean time you have to download 8MB every ten minutes (and upload them to other nodes, if you run a listening one)


I don't know what you mean by Bitcoin getting stronger because the nodes/blockchain/network simply exist. Bitcoin never gets weaker or stronger. If Bitcoin could not survive spammers/attacks, it doesn't deserve to exist and will die.


Of course, that is what decentral means. Everybody is free to run the code and enforce the rules he wants to (although if you want to remain on the Bitcoin network, you have to follow/enforce the rules Satoshi defined)
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:40:10
1.) You are confusing me with another person because you never talked to me about 8MB blocks
2.) 8MB are possible in Segwit2x, someone linked to a block with a 3.6MB block --&gt; double it and you have 7.2MB (I admit it is not 8MB but still too much in my opinion)

Totally agree. The insults against some people are getting ridiculous and mods should delete them immediately.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:11:06
You are under the assumption that everybody loves Bitcoin and will do nothing to harm it. We have clearly seen in the past that sudden mempool increases do happen and that people will spam the network (for whatever reason), meaning that these kind of blocks could happen. There are clearly some people (scared bankers or maybe even governments) who are against Bitcoin and will try to harm the network
