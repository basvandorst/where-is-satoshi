Growth is better

Sorry man I ain’t watching a 20 minute cartoon to disprove basic economics 
And before that they survived shittily
We want our economy to grow. We want people to spend their money so that businesses can invest and grow. We want people to take out loans to buy homes and start businesses. 
No deflation won’t mean humanity is going to fall off the earth but it’s going to severely hurt growth 
If you have an A in economics you’d understand 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:35:46
If companies raise their prices to account for deflation then there is no deflation 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:46:25
The conclusion that you’re an idiot? They stopped using it in 2006
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:50:04
The cost of goods and services
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:45:16
Because it wasn’t useful before or after the crisis and M2 conveyed the necessary info. 
They stopped tracking it in 2006
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:25:05
Deflation/inflation is a change in purchasing power 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:08:49
It’s a lot different legally. Especially if es trying to hide it 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:14:48


Real world examples? Not that I'm aware of


Sure some people will still invest, but they'll invest less


It does, but people will spend less and save more. That's not how you grow the economy
Also consider that 2% deflation would mean that everyone gets a 2% raise every year and how that will impact business
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:08:33
You can do that now if you build your home yourself
Cuz that’s what you’re gonna have to do in the world you’re describing
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:06:17
Oh god Rothschild? Nope I’m out. You’re crazy
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:25:35
and plutonium, dont forget that
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:19:31
You declare your I vestments and split them....
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:46:24
This is a quick read that will probably do a better job than i can
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:47:33
I’m confused by what you’re saying 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:46:06
That’s not how economics works 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:47:02
Markets boom and bust. It’s the cycle of growth. Also how does deflation stop that
Homes are most Americans major store of wealth so I guess that’s a good thing in some ways. If you’re referring to the recession that’s not because of inflation 
Yeah and now we have iPhones that can see your face and you and I can argue instantaneously from different continents
Yeah just being snarky
Ok whatever on the bankruptcy thing I’m not gonna go into that cuz I don’t entirely understand your point. But what about home loans, that’s more wealth for the banks and less for homeowners 
So you want to get rid of credit? Are you just an anarchist?
Yeah I agree wealth inequality is an issue but inflation isn’t the cause of that, there’s always going to be rich people and poor people-the gap should absolutely be closer, but there always will be a gap
Also as an aside I thought LSE wasn’t part of UofL? I’m a yank tho so I don’t know squat
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:01:24
Cool go live in the woods then. I’m gonna enjoy the trappings that modern society provides through “meaningless” economic growth. People having jobs is “meaningless” economic growth too? 
Also what the fuck is your entire first sentence. Do you understand what the boom bust cycle is? Where the fuck did you take economics
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:16:09
Only 20 minutes of cartoons I watch is nature my guy
And they teach that economic growth is a bad thing at LSE?
I mean talking about the impact of humanity on earth is a whole other thing
You realize that deflation transfers wealth to creditors right
And the poor now days live a lot better than they did 100 years ago
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:30:19
You’re a conspiracy theorist
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:25:05
Because its 100% guaranteed barring nuclear war
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:44:32
Because you want people to spend their money? Economies don’t grow if everyone just hides their money under the bed
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:51:38
I’ll invest next month when I can get even more with my money. And good luck paying back any loans
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:43:51
yeah he's a total idiot, totally has no experience in investing
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:35:51
do you even know what genocidal means?
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:31:36
You're talking about the guy who wants to raise taxes on the wealthy? The proposed tax hike referred to as the "Warren Buffett tax"?
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:33:20
there's not threat of physical violence, what the fuck world do you live in
i guess not the USA
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:27:49
BRK.A went up 19.5% last year
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:22:45
so you're going to tell a bunch of poor people to put their money into a highly volatile currency? lovely
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:05:37
that's a blog hosted by Forbes, if you actually read Forbes you'd see that they've got plenty of clickbait bullshit
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:51:48
so shouldn't he know a lot about how it works?
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:37:26
yes, because the government forces us to work
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:47:32
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:06:34
Yep definitely
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:21:41
except that he was entirely correct on this subject?
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:35:20
Not like he's a Nobel laureate who is likely the single most read economist in the country, if not the planet 
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:45:17


just because he doesn't utilize a technology doesn't mean his opinion isn't valid jesus christ.
and if you actually RTFA (or WTFV) you'd see that he supports it as a means of exchange **just not as an investment**, for fucks sake you're embarrassing yourself and the bitcoin community
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:26:16
oh dear god
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:41:33
why? so because he doesn't support he can't say anything?
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:56:29
except if you knew anything about Buffett that's the exact opposite of what he does
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:22:16
if you knew literally anything about Warren Buffett you would know Bitcoin is basically the exact opposite of what he invests in
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:48:11
first of all that's wrong
second of all that doesn't make the any government, and the US in particular, genocidal
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:09:07
no, IRS just said that it's actually so property
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:24:33


yep, they're very tricky. he notoriously avoided them in 90's during the boom because he felt like it was impossible to value them and thus escaped the bust 
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:18:25
except he was actually right as there was a massive crash two years later
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:13:12
do you have a link? i hadn't heard of this
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:18:41
"when the shoeshine tells you to buy, sell"
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:42:02
that's isn't how the federal reserve creates money lol
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:29:48
Then what the fuck is this shit
@_date: 2014-01-01 08:30:27
The peace prize isn't even awarded by the same group as the others for fcks sake
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:37:45
not uniquely, just rarer
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:49:06
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:21:05
he was actually right in this video...
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:03:36
so he didn't have a crystal ball is your criticism of him? he also missed the dotcom boom of the 90s, but he also missed the crash
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:50:31
taxes, every business in the country uses it, it's backed by the largest military in the world?
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:08:45
except bitcoins are basically the exact opposite of Buffett's style of investing?
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:47:55
because one of the most successful financiers ever's opinion holds as much weight as some random old dude
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:02:17
he owns 15% of IBM
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:47:06
yeah! this guy doesn't know shit about investing or finance
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:53:22
except he actually did praise it as a method of exchange?
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:49:38
and he totally doesn't know shit about investing and finance
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:19:44
stay away from bitcoin...as a form of investment
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:41:57
so i'm going to take that as a no?
and to answer you're question, yes. because I'm not a retard and use words correctly like you
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:49:04
love the quotes, very edgy, shows that you don't know what fascism is
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:04:44
And? They give it to opposing ideologies all the time (this year winners are exact opposite). It's about body of work not opinion 
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:03:42
everyone makes losses every once in a while, he just has a shit ton more wins than losses 
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:39:08
he actually supports Bitcoin as a means of exchange, just not as an investment
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:32:00
I'm not, one of the most successful investors ever is
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:40:05
first time being mentioned by someone relevant.yeah its gonna hurt when it isnt nice
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:27:45
Yeah. Just 19.5% returns last year. Not making any money
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:46:16
wow you totally burned him with that totally unrelated and out of context quote!
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:10:13
ahh the expected "this is actually a good thing" post, surprised it took so long tbh
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:40:31
and he's famous and rich for being able to avoid them better than basically everyone
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:21:24
yeah, definitely doesn't know shit about investing
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:38:37
yes because that's the main issue in the federal budget
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:06:48


because he doesn't have any authority or experience on the subject right?
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:45:27
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:43:07


oh you're one of those people
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:06:45
you realize the declaration of independence isn't a legal document right
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:23:44
So how do I buy a house or take a business loan (the big one)
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:31:29
yeah, they also had a life expectancy of 40 back when they did shit like that too
if you're honestly advocating those as a solution to avoid loaning on a macroeconomic scall then you're fucking retarded. like, I can put up with a lot of retarded economic shit (i've said plenty) but this is just too fucking much
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:10:07
Just because they can't teach doesn't mean they don't know what they're talking about
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:58:51
yep, he's only Nobel Laureate Princeton Professor, no credibility
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:57:35


how so? seems hard to be an effective currency when the greater majority of the population doesn't have internet access 
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:08:17
Except it's awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences?
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:00:32
it was hyperbolic
but the average home price is ~$215,000. You don't save up for that quite easily. and we aren't talking about mcmansions. You're daft if you think people buy homes straight up. And plenty of people took out mortgages and loans in like 1900-1945. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:43:13
you can use bitcoins on a dumbphone?
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:09:35
Like this year the guys had opposing views
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:16:50
And those are highly diversified and stable. Bitcoin isn't 
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:46:50
It's given out by the Swedish Royal Academy… endowed =\= given out 
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:10:45
Says the Internet commenter about the Nobel Laureate and Tenured Proffesor
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:54:48
yeah and those countries are in the shitter for the most part
@_date: 2013-12-30 07:29:22
and lending is a vital part of an economy so if people don't take out loans the economy is fucked
@_date: 2013-12-30 07:31:12
except at this point in time bitcoins aren't a currency, they're a commodity
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:23:59
Pretty much everything you said in the first paragraph was incorrect since it is a Nobel prize and isn't given out by a bank
