Mining pool or companies that also do the mining for you?   If it's the later i think PBmining.com was the cheapest three months ago. .... Just checked and it's currently 0.0014 bit coin (46 cents US) per GHs for five years, with a minimum of 25 GHs now.

"Total Number of 'Exit' Routers: 	1083"   
I wonder how hard it would be for a significant number of countries to start monitoring exit nodes and share that information.

I choose mine a few years ago so I'm a little out of date.   The wallet will need to download the entire block chain which is multiple gigabytes long which took me days to download.   I think some of the newer wallets found some way to speed it up.   I suggest looking for  the "Getting started with Bitcoin" link on the right side of the forum's page and go into that.  It has a section on Wallets.

Currently a bitcoin is worth 0.39 oz of gold.

When there is good news the price goes up.  
When there is bad news the prices goes down.  
There is no good way to tell when it's finished going up or down.  To buy them for a low price wait for some bad news and the price to drop for a while before buying them.   
The best piece of advice I can give you is to make sure you put the bitcoin(s) into a wallet you have exclusive control of and print a paper backup.  Some bitcoin companies got hacked in the past and after they went bankrupt were unable to give people their bitcoins.

You might want to ask them if they are using a VPN or TOR or something that would change their IP address.  Also it might be a good idea to send localbitcoin a note telling them about the problem and include the IP address (myipaddr.com).
