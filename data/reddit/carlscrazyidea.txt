I thought miners were open to segwit and the argument was they want the block size increase with segwit. If the block size never gets increased then they are limited to 1mb of transactions every 10 min no matter how big bitcoin gets. What am I missing?

BUT WAIT! His first example at 9:40? It went from $250 to $500 and then came down to like $350. I am no expert but I see 2 types of crashes that nobody talks about. One crash is were the price drops well under were the bull run started. The other crash is were it doesn't crash well under the start of the bull run. The problem with this is a guy trying to take a quick profit may not get a chance to get back in and i suspect many people end up in that situation.

Lightoflucifer is right but theoretically its impossible. I stand corrected we currently have around 500,000 addresses with 1 or more bitcoin in it. I would bet many people have more than 1 wallet so i will change my figure to say less than 500,000 people will get a chance at 1 coin... 
Edit: I forgot about tresor wallets making a new address every deposit so i bet my first number isn't far off the truth

We do have an idea because we know 4.07% of addresses have more than 1 bitcoin in it. So I can guess with a 4% margin of accuracy. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:41:14
if he is trolling it sounds like he may have actually tried this idea or is very close to someone who is doing something like this. He could also be trolling about the scale of it. If you look at all his comments it sounds like he knows a bit about this topic.

in moon dollars bitcoin is gentlemen 
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:36:10
It is guided by knowing how many addresses having more than 1 bitcoin in it. Since we know for a fact that people own more than 1 addresses I can say with 100% accuracy the number is less than 4.07%. Pointing out that 3% is a "pure guess" is something I wasn't denying. Saying it "isn't even guided by anything" is false.

This is actually the comment I was looking for. Granted I did cause people to make assumptions because I did not explain my life story. People have risked their life for freedom and I am just doing it with some money. Freedom feels great and even if I just sent my money into a war they will ultimately die for it was worth it. You can call me bullshit but its the truth!
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:57:27
I just read your post and my answer is put all your savings in and keep the $1000. Then go get any job as in any job even making $9 an hour. Dump 90% of your paycheck into Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin will triple in the next year you're actually working for 3 times the pay.

If Bitcoin is a currency that can cross borders and compete right along side a countries currency it creates a unique situation that I believe never existed till now. Am I wrong by saying the only thing stopping it from destroying some countries currency is adoption.

Why so many assumptions? It seems that I have been pegged as a broke working American who has nothing to fall back on other then this 401k. Most people seem to assume that I am not diversified. The truth is 5% of Americans will retire rich and 15% more will retire with a middle class income.

@_date: 2016-12-21 14:17:48
So that's a really good question. I guess I instinctively know the value of a dollar because I value it everyday. So it's natural for me to want to know the value of a Bitcoin in dollars. But this is were it gets interesting I have been living in the Philippines for the past 3 years but I never check the value in pesos. I survive on peso but value dollars and I just realized that.

Because A few people have made really good replies to your logic and repeatedly you come you just want to fight. I understand u disagreed with the one guy but you have taking the same position on the last 10 people who replied to you.
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:28:05
Looks like this is the best explanation so far....
Also see this post of mine in 2010, which I think is pretty much exactly how Satoshi reasoned the future would play out, though I now believe it to be very wrong. The main misunderstandings which I and probably Satoshi had are:
No one anticipated pool mining, so we considered all miners to be full nodes and almost all full nodes to be miners.
I didn't anticipate ASICs, which cause too much mining centralization.
SPV is weaker than I thought. In reality, without the vast majority of the economy running full nodes, miners have every incentive to collude to break the network's rules in their favor.
The fee market doesn't actually work as I described and as Satoshi intended for economic reasons that take a few paragraphs to explain.
@_date: 2016-12-26 09:15:57
@_date: 2016-12-26 16:50:58
What % of miners are signalling now?
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:33:31
you could say 1/3 I see it as 10% because the government was going to get 20%... now or then. the 10% is a penalty and even that could be justified by the matching bonus the company gave me. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 13:59:31
Maybe not this shit happened to me also I just didn't post it in Reddit

I saw your last post thanks for the update. Really cool! Over the last year I have brought many people into Bitcoin. We all must not forget we are not alone in this movement and as we spread the word together we are making a big impact together.
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:25:55

When you comment on a hype post the correct thing to do is add more hype. Let me give you an example: After close analysis of this article I have to agree 100%. It clearly has factual data to back the future price prediction.
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:27:24
freedom is way more valuable. This is a point I see many people overlooking. If a person gets a taste of freedom from being a part of bitcoin it can cause them to easily over look a middle mans transaction fee or an extra hoop to pay for something. Much of bitcoin growth up till now has freedom attached to it. Example look at segwit or bitcoin core mostly built by volunteers. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:05:34
I think he says what he needs to say about bitcoin to support his real motive. That is selling gold and silver on his website so he can buy more gold and silver for himself. I think he sees bitcoin as a threat to his hodl of metals.

WAIT "tiny" what is the real fee/cost? I get your point and the other point they are totally right and I agree. I could make a point and say that the fee is so big that we as humans have become slaves to banks. Banks have become so powerful because of that tiny fee.

Right before i clicked the cash out button it said i was going to be missing out on $XXX... that number was about 6 times what I cashed out and that is 26 years from now. Is it really crazy to think I cant do better in 26 years? Without a tax free bonus 401k?

Bitcoin would not make the list of top 100 opportunities. 50% of all land still isn't being taxed properly. Capital gains on property sale is openly not paid or paid at a fraction of real value. I can go on and on.

its just a difference in philosophy not a personal attack. I see your point I just dont agree with it. You say if you had free time you would spend it with your family. My first thought to that response is why not start a side venture with your family then you get to spend time with your family and make money. What is "free time with family"? Your goal should be to make every second "free time". I have am not rich but I definitely put in my time cutting lawns to not end up having to make sacrifices like not having free time for my family. I currently run a second hand clothing store with my wife and daughter. Bitcoin for me is one of the store of value I trust to keep me and my family diversified and safe from unnecessary sacrifices like me having to get a job and put my kid in daycare.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:56:06
So you could label me a "guy in the crowd" so let me try to answer this. I upvoted it because I want it to get attention to see a response from the accused. I did not upvote because I believe it or want to believe it. 
I have sat on the sideline in the beginning gathering information and I personally have made up my mind that this accusation of asic boost is real. I also read in both sub and listen to both sides.... "I am just a guy in the crowd "
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:27:41
What is the difference if the price drops to $800 and its currently at lets say $1250 or if the price would be at $1750 but its being held down around $1,250. Is that technically the same price pressure? Someone correct me if I am wrong.

Some of the answers in the post are really bad. Bro it's a good idea really. If you didn't know u had it then clearly you don't need it and who cares about $380 a month at age 65. Take a shot at being rich and dump it in Bitcoin for real!
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:27:48
I was thinking the same thing. If the gold market is 7 trillion then 1 trillion is not a big number. I once collected gold nuggets from eBay and sold them all for Bitcoin. Once people understand Bitcoin I think if nothing else we can get 1 trillion from the gold market.

It's not that the support isn't good. The problem is email support for a financial service absolutely doesn't make sense. When you deal with people's money you need live support or a phone number.

Coinbase is dealing with 5 digit single transactions regularly at least have a VIP service number for people with $5000 plus balances.

If price was dropping a lot I would be checking the news to be sure it's not a core unfixable problem. If Bitcoin just stops functioning then I will stop buying.

I recommend u listened to his last pod cast he explained why he doesn't have a $1 to his name right now. I actually watched his documentary a year ago and didn't really care for the guy but after listening to him tell his story on the pod cast I actually changed my opinion about him.

@_date: 2016-10-10 01:16:16
Man don't get me wrong I hodl to be rich. If this was some world peace coin or acted like doge coin I wouldn't be around.
When I said I don't care what the price goes to... example: I'm buying now for about $610 a coin but if in 2 years the price is $1500 I'm still going to buy coins. I even see myself buying coins at $10,000 a coin the price for me would not matter.
@_date: 2016-10-16 13:39:25

I'm an American and I get all the people who say except Bitcoin but I really can't explain to you guys what it's like to run a business in a 3rd world. 75% of my customers don't have a smart phone. 100% of my customers are using cash. 75% don't have a bank account. 90% don't have a home computer. 99.99% don't even understand the basics of Bitcoin. 
To say put an iPad and except Bitcoin I don't think you really understand how crazy that would be.
My market would be 5% of the locals and my plan is to at least say the word Bitcoin so when they see it in the news or in a video online ex ex at least it's not the first time they hear the word.

Depends on why the drop in price. If it's some rich Chinese guy selling all his coins I would run to the bank. If it was a fail in the Bitcoin system I may walk to the bank or go the next day.

1) I have dug into the cheapest option and fastest. Example: let's say I have 20,000 peso (about $475) that is the max transaction amount that can be sent in one transaction from GCash to coins.ph. I walk into a Globe dealer should be one on every corner of Philippines. Loading my GCash account is free up to 50,000 peso per day (about $1100) the fee comes after you spend your GCash. Sending 20,000 peso to coins.ph cost 40 peso fee that's less then $1 for $475 that's around .25%. To make it even more crazy I can do this whole process in less than 10 min.
@_date: 2016-10-13 17:24:30
All for the movement right lol. Actually it's against the law in the Philippines to cheat on your wife and divorce is not allowed.

A payment channel is a simple form of a smart contract. The sender commits a certain amount of capital upfront into a special multisig address. The multisig address requires both the sender and receiver to agree on how to split the capital. Initially the entire capital is assigned to the sender and none to the receiver. However, whenever a payment is sent over the channel, the split is updated to that the receiver is assigned the sum of payments sent.
The sender and receiver need to agree on the precise rules of the system for this to work. The Moonbeam protocol specification defines these rules.

We wanted to give our customers an update regarding the current status of the Ethereum (ETH) network and the upcoming ETH hard fork.
In order to protect against denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, the Ethereum foundation plans to promote a hard fork of the ETH network on Tuesday, October 18, 2016 PDT. This will likely cause ETH network instability for a period of time. Customers should expect delays to ETH deposits and withdrawals from Coinbase for up to the next 7 days. All customer ETH funds will be safely secured on Coinbase during this period.
In order to ensure the integrity of all customers’ ETH transactions, Coinbase will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals from all customer ETH wallets starting Monday, October 17, 2016 at 6 P.M. PDT. As soon as possible after the fork, Coinbase will resume support for deposits and withdrawals of ETH.
Please be advised that Coinbase will support only one fork of the ETH protocol which we determine, at our sole discretion, best reflects the consensus approach. We will not support any other fork of the ETH protocol. If you wish to transact on alternative forked chains, please withdraw your ETH from the Coinbase platform no later than Monday, October 17, 2016 at 12 P.M. PDT.
Customers may continue to store and trade ETH, as well as engage in ETH transactions with other Coinbase users during the suspension period. Please check our Twitter account for real-time updates. Additional information may also be found on our status page.
Coinbase will delay ethereum classic (ETC) withdrawal support until after the ETH hard fork is resolved. Customers eligible to withdraw can follow our Twitter account for updates.

I talked to my buddy when the price was $160 I remember the talk because it was all about how confident we were about the rise in price. I just talked to my buddy yesterday and we were laughing about how "this is basically $160 with a zero".
We just had the same exact talk about $16,000. It honestly doesn't feel any different. I could actually tell you I felt less confident at $160 then I do now. One of the big differences now is that the altcoins have value and I think that creates a solid bitcoin foundation.

I watched a youtube video that showed how you can charge a phone with 50 aluminum soda cans and ocean salt water. 
my point is being profitable and having a real lucrative business idea are different things. I have followed your threads from the beginning and my feelings are that you have found yourself a strategy to make "profit" but in no way do you have a scalable lucrative business that people should want to duplicate.
Correct me if I am wrong I am open to the debate and feedback.

Maybe you missed a key point he said "I withdrew 300 DOLLARS". What happens when he no longer has to convert the Bitcoin into something else to use it?
