Don't overpay. Many people might have had this idea before. People could 'counter trade' this by buying a bunch of old and broken junk hard drives in bulk for cheap, and then sell them piecemeal for a 10x markup (say) at flea markets (to people who had the same idea as you). Just saying, this is what your counter party might be up to.

You're welcome. Good luck!

I would use [dice]( to select a list of 12 words (out of the 2048 from the [BIP39 word list]( and memorize those.
This would be plenty safe in terms of entropy (and also easy to remember). For additional safety, you could enter those words into a hardware wallet (that you might buy later) before accessing your funds, so your private key/seed never has to touch an internet computer.
I would still write down the words and store them in a safe place (or two) as backup.

I have no idea. But if you have reason to believe that there's 50+ bitcoin on it or something, it might be worth using a professional service. I would use a very reputable (and expensive) one, that's using a four-eyes principle etc, and maybe offer them a profit share, to avoid them stealing from you.

Yes, you are right. Leaving your car unlocked in the parking lot, with the keys in the ignition, is stupid. But the guy who is stealing your car is still an asshole. Both statements can be true, I think.

Most F1 students are eligible to get a US driver's license.

True for the US, but there are three billion people in China and India who disagree. Both countries have enormous potential for economic growth; and people just *love* physical gold there.
No need to put all eggs in one basket when we can invest in both digital gold (bitcoin) *and* physical gold imo.

Regular hard drives can be securely erased, eg by overwriting with random numbers a few times etc. In contrast, it is impossible to securely erase ssd drives. (The only NSA approved secure erase method for an ssd drive is to physically 'pulverize' it.) So maybe there's hope?

The bitcoin price in tether would go up (due to tether loosing value). But the bitcoin price in usd could actually go down imo, because people might fear that the bitcoin price previously was 'artificially inflated' with tether 'printed out of thin air' (independent of whether that's true or not). 
If tether looses value vs usd, then the bitcoin price in tether will be higher than the bitcoin price in usd. Equivalently, the tether vs usd exchange rate would suffer, breaking the peg.

I have both a Trezor Model T and a Ledger Nano S. Both are probably equally safe. The Trezor software feels easier to use. I would go with the Trezor.
