I want to believe...

How many of the sales were just people wanting to buy things with bitcoin for novelty reasons?    
Will be interesting to see what the graph looks like in a year or 2.

The exchange is [BitNZ](
See this thread for details:

Do you have any plans to make "Waggle" an open standard for non-Hive apps?
I think it's a great idea for a feature, but would be great for it to become popular so that other wallets can adopt it.
@_date: 2014-05-26 08:30:34
I feel for you dude :(.    
Paypal is such a terrible site. I can't wait for BTC to destroy it. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:46:25
Cool story bro.
@_date: 2014-08-30 02:09:16
yeh it kind of annoys me how in most of these videos everyone says you can send money for "free". Which is technically true, but false in practice.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:52:07
Even over HTTPS, both your primary and secondary passwords in the URL?    
This doesn't seem secure at all. We are talking about sending money...   This seems very vulnerable to interception.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:46:03
I'm referring to the PHP example under "Send Many Transactions"    
$json_url = "
    
What am I missing here?
@_date: 2014-08-10 00:12:30
Show your work mate :)    
Are you sure you've done the calculation correctly?     
If you had done a true DCA you would be well above the current price.
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:16:43
Pyramid Scheme?
@_date: 2014-05-06 09:00:06
This looks sweet! Aucklander here.
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:54:37
To a few feet off the ground!
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:11:01
Did you use Overstock because you could pay with BTC or were you shopping there anyway and just picked the BTC option at checkout?
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:40:20
Maybe the Russians?

I've done hardly any work today, this has been a great ride.

"Nakamoto said he had never heard of BTC until his son told him he had been contacted by a reporter three weeks ago." This keeps getting better.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:11:11
Yeh of course, but the only thing in the Newsweek article that is actual real evidence that this is the guy is that he said "I'm not involved with that anymore.". 
If now he is denying it completely then Newsweek don't really have anything to go on.
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:01:30
Can you explain how you can buy bitcoins online with your debit card with iDeal?   
Isn't there risk of charge backs with that?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:06:53
That is possible, but this is also the first time that there has been such a huge profile on who Satoshi is. The other times were all conspiracy theories.

You should submit this to: 
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:56:50
That's worse in my opinion. No one has caught this or thought to change it in 3 years?
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:57:55
According to this LA Times reporter he said "I was never involved":

"Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence."
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:20:01
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:35:30
That's a good point.
@_date: 2014-06-09 07:21:08
The 2 way ATMs I've used all have rates comparable to the currency exchange kiosks for any large amounts though.
@_date: 2014-04-10 09:02:37
So what you are saying is, the price will definitely either go up or down.
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:21:41
What is SI?
@_date: 2014-01-03 01:12:16
And either way you lose too?
@_date: 2014-08-10 00:04:01
OP is right, but his DCA math is wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:44:58
yeh but a 64 year old with the same name as the infamous creator? I know his name is Dorian, but he has Satoshi Nakamoto in his actual name.
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:51:18
sounds legit...
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:24:24
Around 36 people is a tiny sample size. Would be great to get everyone in this sub to respond.
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:14:22
Can you explain why the dollar needs to be backed by a commodity to be a sound currency? It's my understanding that (amongst other things) agreed utility of the currency is what gives it value not a backing. Seeing as most countries' currencies don't have a backing and haven't for decades, haven't we proved this point?

When he says you can send bitcoin via SMS or by email what does he mean?    
Only way I can see that working would be if you were to send a private key for a wallet preloaded with bitcoin via an email (which would be a horrible idea security wise), am I missing another way this could work?
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:49:16
....It's always fucking china.
@_date: 2014-12-25 13:21:41
0.25 BTC. OP is generous.
@_date: 2014-03-22 08:34:59
Then this isn't for you haha. There are plenty of existing services that can do that generate them for you if you have that need.
@_date: 2014-08-20 10:24:59
Pretty sure if you have 2FA you can't use API to send/withdraw BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:25:16
Surely some nerd at a bank or something that saw his ID would say "Any relation to the Bitcoin inventor?" at some point in the last few years. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 09:51:54
No really guyz, this time it's really really really extra banned k?
@_date: 2014-08-12 05:49:10
Minus server costs plus all his time developing/maintaining it and processing deposits   every day. I would say he's still at a loss. :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:39:59
No shit. I literally bought my first bitcoin at the top of that curve. FML.
