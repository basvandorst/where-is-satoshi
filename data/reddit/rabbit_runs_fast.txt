could have just used litecoin

not with the hodl mentality.  People are using BTC as a store of wealth.  Stop hodling and start using it on your favorite websites.  I'll be [waiting](

Asked him.  He said it depends what you're using it for.  Big difference doing things like downloading media from the public library.  Also noticed big difference eliminating lag on streaming services.

start using it to buy stuff.  It kills that feeling pretty quickly.

Why was it a mistake?  Perhaps you bought into bitcoin for the wrong reasons.  Spend some time researching what bitcoin actually is, and does.  
If you liked it at 17K you should love it at 14K, so why not buy more?  
You have 2 choices.  Get out now and buy back in 3 years from now at $50K, or just forget about your recent purchase.  Put it into cold storage and stop looking at the price.

Not that hard if you're even remotely flexible :-( 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:21:03
Mainly because we didn't get into this to use as a store of value.  Up until the time the fees started to get out of hand, it's always been sold as a currency.  This store of value business is nothing more than people making excuses.  Maybe these excuses wouldn't be a problem, but bitcoin is under attack.  There are enemies all around, trying to kill the mighty king.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:29:46
Not when competition catches up.  Once there's a bitcoin atm on every street corner fees will come down.  A smart exchange could build a network of ATMS and do no fee if you hold your bitcoin in their wallet.  Charge the fees on the back end.

Some estimates put the lost amount at 4 million. It's hard for me to comprehend there's enough bitcoin to meet market demand.  As more and more transactions are moved off chain this becomes even more likely.   
Might not be today, but I am all but certain at some-point Coinbase and other exchanges are going to become "leveraged", and will be selling more bitcoin than they really have.  And when that day comes, there's going to be a huge run on the "banks" and shit's really going to hit the fan.

To bad there's not enough bitcoin to go around.  Better hurry up before they are all gone.

@_date: 2018-01-12 11:35:04
Im not so sure.  Coinbase's trading platform GDAX pays the network fees to send your bitcoin elsewhere.  Meaning if you leave their platform, they will pay the stupid high fees to do it.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:48:05
Is there a limit on how many I can get?

@_date: 2018-01-22 14:09:21
Except the Blockchain is like 150gb.  That’s a huge amount of resources for a single ‘program’ to run on a computer.  I’m reluctant to allocate space on my newly built gaming rig (PUBG)   Who’s going to run a 300 gb node on their laptop?   They’re. Not.  Changing the block size can and will give bitcoin centralization.   
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:10:09
You &amp; I know that, but the masses do not.  I would venture a guess that at minimum half of the total crypto market cap is stored on exchanges.

u/snrpro  What kind of volume where you doing with that account?  How many deposits, or withdrawals where you doing in a  given week?  What was the size of your average transaction?  Over 10k?  How long where you using Coinbase?  Sorry for all the questions, but you were doing something they didn't like.  It would be nice to figure out what it was.

can anyone ELI5 these Channels?  Who, what, when, why kind of thing.  Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:04:05
Sounds good bro.  Doesn't matter to me, I'm buying either way.  
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:29:10
Thank you great explanation.  Can you have a channel to support the network, with out the intention of using it for your own specific payments?  But to help others find a route for their payments?  Or would that be handled by running a node?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:21:15
My nonexpert theroy is, wall street and the bankers are driving the price down, so they can buy in for cheap.  Conspiracy theory, 10 to 20 years from now, the "cosmopolitans" will own most of the bitcoin and trading volumes will be non-existent.  We will be doing all of our trading off chain, and the actual btc price will not matter to us.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:32:45
Maybe I hate coinbase?  Maybe I want to buy bitcoin anonymously?  Either way those dollar bills need to find a way into the bitcoin ecosystem.   
EDIT:  Maybe I don't want to get mugged by the guy on LocalBitcoin when we meet up.

It would be come an alt.  Bitcoin will have crawled through a river of shitcoins, and come out clean on the other side.

No thank you.  It would create trust issues.  
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:53:35
It's the same kind of bullshit that we are limited to $100 bills.  Would it really be so bad to have a $500, or a $1,000 bill?  Guess well just have to keep using BTC

Thanks again.  I've got a lot of research to do on this.  Guess I'm going to have to get a node, and a couple of channels up and running.

that and a phone call to apple makes it all go away.  That or a quick version update.  Pretty much pointless.

Now you need to [learn about bitcoin, and what bitcoin is, and does.](  You'll also want to learn about why it's super [dangerous to keep your bitcoin on an exchange.](  
Also learn about why it's even more [dangerous to hold your own private keys]( but ultimately why it's the [safest way to hold bitcoin]( (longterm)

@_date: 2017-12-23 19:48:34
That's not how it got here.  Those of us that have been around bitcoin for a few years, have used it to buy stuff.  It's only recently where the fees have made that more burdensome.  A lot of people bought bitcoin as it was needed, didnt use it to "make Dollars"

Use Coinbase owned [GDAX]( when you can buy btc/ltc/eth/bcash.  Fee's are much less, and you can use a limit order.  So procedure would be 
*Deposit fiat to Coinbase (not buying crypto)
*Transfer to GDAX (free) by going to coin you want click deposit
*Deposit from Coinbase account (3rd tab under deposit)
*Buy btc using GDAX platform
