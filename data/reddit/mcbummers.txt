Its the seller who gets stung with the fees from what I remember. What you pay is what you end up with.
I can't remember if there is the usual fee to transfer out of their wallet to your own. You'll have to check the small print.

Yep, although they might make you show ID and prove who you say you are if you've not bought from there before. localbitcoins hold the actual bitcoin he's selling in a sort of escrow thing. You arrange to pay him (i transferred from my bank into his) you then click to say you've paid. If he's satisfied he'll click to say he received the money and localbitcoins releases the bitcoin to you. you can then transfer it to your wallet.
Worse case, you pay and he doesn't send you the bitcoin? Well the site holds his bitcoins, if you click to say he didn't send them then it goes to arbitration. You can show screen caps of the money transfer and they'll ban him and send you the bitcoin.
The risk is with him really, because scammers will pay, get the bitcoin and then try doing chargebacks or telling their bank it was unauthorised payment.

localbitcoins is your quickest and most straightforward option. The only risk is to the seller, not the buyer.

Yep, really hate when people get that saying wrong.

You do not have to download the Blockchain.
Ledger is orders of magnitude safer than wallet.dat on usb.
Coinbase has their bank in Estonia.

Refute the content?... it's someone's subjective opinion on what might happen. Along with every other 'bitcoin might do this' article.
Meaningless is an apt description because their opinion does not count for anything or have any bearing on the outcome.

Pretty sure you can find an equally 'qualified' person who'll state bitcoin will crash to zero. It's just meaningless speculation.

These topics should be deleted and posters given a warning.
"some random predicts a number for bitcoin at some point in the future"
It is absolutely meaningless.
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:37:55
No, the point is the internet is full of articles of one expert or another saying completely opposite things which, has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on bitcoin markets, adoption etc.
I'm just sick of seeing them, they are meaningless.

Can you not use localBitcoins and do the whole thing through that?
