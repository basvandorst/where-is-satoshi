Honestly doesn't anyone else feel the OP comes off a bit too much like a marketer?
It's better if people ask to be pain in bitcoin, rather than trying to get people to accept your bitcoin who don't know anything about it.
It's just not the best approach, and even your CAPITAL letters in the OP is clear evidence how you are unable to perceive the world in view of others around you.
TL;DR your personality comes off as over zealous and preachy, if I found out from bitcoin from someone like you I would never had been interested in it.

Other than the thrill of doing something different, how is putting money in to an ATM with a QR code different than with the magnetic strip on your debit card?
What do you find "thrilling" about it?

to irritate the fuck out of everyone by using QR codes, which are the dumbest thing ever invented and do not translate in to any real use case scenarios (other than causing confusion.)
Just stop thinking this shit is cool, its not.

PLEASE STOP USING QR CODES
THEY ARE FUCKING TERRIBLE !!!

And during that time your profit margin has shrunk considerably. Will you at least break even or are you going to have to chalk it up as a loss?

bitcoins are too volatile, aren't you looking at the charts?
Dogecoin doesn't fear the market. Doge too stronk. Why didn't you guys listen to doge?
