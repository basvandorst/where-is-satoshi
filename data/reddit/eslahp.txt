Yes, its an altcoin.

I'm going to say its completely intentional so to add credibility to their altcoin.

In the US, capital gains of profits held less than a year and a day are taxed at ordinary income.  So if I bought in January and sold now, and made 80k, I'll lose whatever bracket I'm in, we'll use 28% . So I lost 28% of that 80k + whatever state taxes you would have.
Now that good news is that you didn't lose as much as you would if that was traditional earned income.  The IRS treats capital gains like interest income. You don't pay social security and medicare, etc (another 6.2%).  
Now, if that had been gains held on an item of a Year and a day, then it would be long term capital gains.  Those are subject to a tax rate of 0/15/20.  If you're in the 10% or 15% bracket, you pay 0 on it.  If you're in the other brackets you pay 15%.  If you're in the top bracket ($400k+) you pay 20% (this is a 2013 tax law change).

The current law in the US is it must be your primary residence for 2 years consecutively or 2 out of 5 before the sale.  In that case the first 250k is exempt if you're single and 500k if you're married.  You can claim this every 2 years.  One of the biggest tax breaks available to Joe Blow.

Yes, they'll put it on the CTR but its questionable as to wether or not the IRS would follow up on that to the individual level.   The IRS doesnt know if that 10k etf was profit or not.  Its just a reported transaction at that point that the bank was obligated to file.  
The real worry would be if the exchange you sold on 1099's you.  I've been wondering if the exchanges will get to the point that while doing business in the US, the IRS and other entities will come down on them to pay their taxes, and to avoid paying tax on all that $$, they have to show the disbursements and transaction chain, and that might lead to issuing 1099's to clients.  Which that that point, the IRS starts drooling..

I'm looking forward to further tax law changes on that when btc becomes more popular. If the govt wants to argue its not currency for one issue but then the irs wants to for tax implications that will be interesting.  I'd still argue its a simple investment at this point early in the cycle and see if I could get away with ltcg instead of short term.  No intent to fraud and you can always refile amended + penalty if they disagreed and audited.

1099 forms are not only for employer/employee / contractor relations.  There are multiple 1099, in this situation, I'm thinking of something like the 1099-K which is what paypal uses for people who have transactions over a certain amount.
