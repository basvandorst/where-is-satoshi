Don't do this kind of stuff as an U.S. company, or while being physically in the U.S. and not anonymous.

It becomes clear that Bitcoin is controlled by dictators who are starting to make trial controversial changes to see what they can get away with, in preparation for much bigger ones that will divert most of the wealth to themselves.
Once the general public becomes aware of this, Bitcoin will become almost worthless, and it is thus essential to
**SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**

A cardboard box to live in now that BTC is worthless, I suppose?
@_date: 2013-04-22 09:53:38
Upon hearing this alarming news, you should protect yourself ASAP while the price is still high and thus
**SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:34:44
Well, now that your bitcoins are worthless, you can always sell your mom!
I might make a good offer for deeds to her vaginal and anal orifices (depends on their current condition).
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:28:04
As the BitCoin community is ripped apart by this event, you need to protect yourself!
**SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**

Well, fortunately this won't be a problem for much longer!

You got swindled!
The smarter guy won, and that was not you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:12:06
There is no recovery, this is the end.
Bitcoin will forever be know as the ruin of many honest hardworking people, the Ponzi scheme that defrauded the masses in 2013.
In case you still haven't, **SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**

Sell while you still have time!
GET OUT NOW WHILE IT'S HIGH!

@_date: 2013-04-11 22:41:46
Except that to do a transaction you only need to hold Bitcoins for at most around 4 hours, so $145 billion can be done with a $66 market cap, or $6 price per BTC.
Hence, it's a good idea to
**SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**
@_date: 2013-07-06 21:15:47
So basically this is a bank that holds USD but only allows deposits and withdrawals in Bitcoin?
How is the USD held? Where is it located? How does it handle banking and AML regulation?
What guarantees does the user have that his money won't vanish?
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:05:59
They have all realized they need to
**SELL NOW! SELL NOW! SELL NOW!**
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:25:25
Nope, I discovered that trolling Bitcoin users is an highly amusing activity.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:27:52
**THIS IS THE CRASH!**
Soon Bitcoin will be worthless, consigned to the dustbin of history, and best known as Satoshi Nakamoto's Ponzi scheme.
In fact, future attempts at similar frauds will probably be known as "Nakamoto schemes".

Why are you seriously (albeit with tangentially related self-promotion) replying to my troll post?
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:32:29
I guess it's probably more sensible to allocate across either commodities/currencies or all assets, weighted by market cap.
