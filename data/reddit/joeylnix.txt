That is messed up man! They got your money and won’t give it back?? That is steeling in my book. Or at least using there power/position the wrong way. This is why a lot of people don’t get involve with crypto. They trust banks more even when it is costing more. Get a lawyer on it.

Those kids are having fun and learning about new technology. Go girls! ��

Yea I mean when I read the comments I think to myself “why so serious?” It looks like the more serious the comment, the more people like it. 
The only thing I see on this picture is kids having fun. It takes me back to my own childhood.
