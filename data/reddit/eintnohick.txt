Dude. Quit being such a hard head. Ive only being in crypto for a month... my first purchase was bitcoin... but once i actually figured out somewhat what i was doing, i realized btc is awful compared to other coins. I will never buy bitcoin again... it has ZERO value to me because it has zero use to me. I cant use it, cant spend it... so why invest in it. I am sure there are a large number of folks just like me

Ive been trying to verify for the past week. Their servers are overloaded i assume

Starting and running a company isnt that hard. Running a successful company is much harder. 
Believe it or not, most small businesses dont have muti millionaire owners

More like "the crack addict of crypto"

Op is not wrong though. At my old job,  all the dudes would talk crypto everyday and every single female looked disgusted every time

As an American, these stats/arguments mean nothing to me from a lifestyle perspective. Most people from successfully economic countries probably feel the same.
The bottom line, crypto will need to simply become "better" than fiat before it becomes adopted

This doesn't make any sense... its much easier to steal cash from someone than crypto. Its pretty safe to assume every one has cash on them. It's not like this flag says "im a millionaire"

What a stupid article. Bottom line... women don't care about crypto/blockchain. Its as simple as that
I just quit my job but when i worked there all the women were turned off everytime the "bros" would start a conversation regarding crypto.

It's kind of a big deal

USAA for sure. Bank and have insurance there... overall happy with them

This shopify? How did you set up the btc/ltc payments?
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:14:58




The fact that you think this would work is funny and sad. If this worked, literally everything under $14k would be "gifts"

This makes sense then. 
I like CZ even more now

Moral of the post: proofread your title

Fair but I think that a turtle or something would have made more sense
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:24:31
Its not a gift though.... it is a transaction. All you did was add extra steps
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:35:41
I think you missed the real opportunity. This looks like a show piece when really i think people would be looking for a safe place to hide their wallet. A lockable case that looks like a book i think would be a hit

Tell the IRS that!
