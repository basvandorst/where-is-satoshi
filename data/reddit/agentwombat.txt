Probably not why they used it, but it's a letter from the danish alphabet, ø. It also means "empty set" in set theory

But you are still unable to access the box, and therefore the coins, right?

Which cables should transfer data from theese services? Please enlighten me how you would send data across continents

Off-topic: I've been curious about theese "special" changetips. Where is it decided that "three internets" is equal to 3.218 mBTC? I have seen something like gold star, coffee and so on.
I tried searching their webpage, sorry if it's there.
@_date: 2014-09-20 21:57:48
Thanks! I've now made my first real bitcoin purchase
@_date: 2014-10-01 13:29:39
Who gives a shit? lololol
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:03:20
Oh, didn't realize this was possible, but of course makes sense. So to be sure, if I understand you correct.
What you are saying is, I'll have the private key for the wallet(s) the box is using at home for instance. And be able to use them within a desktop wallet or whatever.
@_date: 2014-10-01 13:18:37
Oh cool, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:54:56
Looks great!
I've been thinking about a thing with my paper wallets. What if my house burned down, and I did not store a second copy of the paper wallet. The paper wallet would properly be lost.
Could this case be made fire resistant as well?
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:14:47
Nice one sir, huehuehue :-)
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:37:07
AFAIK Circle never marketed them self as a bank.
But who is that girl?
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:19:18
Yeah, was so excited, untill I met this pop up (I live outside US).
Afterwards I was a bit confused, that even though the pop up had just said I couldn't, somehow I was able to add my creditcard.
Anyhow, it works!
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:01:46
As others are suggesting, Circle has just opened. Though if your plans are to use bitcoin as an investment, maybe on a daily basis. You might want to look into the other exchanges as well (Kraken, bitstamp, etc.). At the moment there is a fairly high creditcard fee at Circle, and therefore it would be cheaper to use bank transactions.
Remember to use 2-fact auth for all your bitcoin services, and if you want to store your bitcoin in a safe and convenient way, have a look a Trezor.

How do you guys move coins out of cold storage (paper wallets)? Let's say you only need a fraction of the coins stored there. What's your "secure" setup for this procedure.
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:14:15
You are absolutely right, and I'm not a fan either of setting up restrictions or anything to prevent this. It might be something that we just have to face and can't really do anything about.
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:46:09


I think it depends on the amount you are depositing into your account. I payed 3.54% in fees last night, but my friend only paid 0.54%.
The only difference was the amount we were depositing.

Buy btc offline, using cash. You should be able to find a seller on localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:23:39
Yea that's what smart about them
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:07:52
Wow awesome cake!
@_date: 2016-03-13 20:30:32


Killer app
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:48:51
Looks very cool ;)
What size is the cool wallet? (You forgot the banana lol)
I would like to hold it where I keep my creditcards in my "non-bitcoin wallet".
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:44:34
Good news everyone!
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:35:28
hahaha first post about the price drop which is actually funny :D
@_date: 2016-03-07 15:17:33
A lot of solutions to Bitcoins scaling problem has been proposed, but even after an event like the roundtable it seems like no consensus has been made and we still don't have any scaling plan for Bitcoin. Are there any future events planned or how will the core devs handle this?
@_date: 2016-06-02 15:29:28
Kk great story lol
@_date: 2018-10-01 14:23:09
Didn't have any problems. Dumped my Bitcoin Gold to BTC today, both the trade and withdraw went through rather quickly. The only trade I've done on the exchange however (account created recently).
Maybe the amount just wasn't high enough

We haven't even seen their final form yet
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:55:49
The bank is called Jyske Bank, which is one of the larger banks here in Denmark. Here is an article about it (in danish) from a Danish newspaper. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:15:23
yes huehuehuehue
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:16:54
Okay just to be sure before trying all kind of passwords I use. It's the device password which can be different and the site or Trezor is not able to verify, right?
The PIN is bound to the Trezor and the same for both GA and myTrezor site.
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:19:24
Thanks! That made some things much more clear. Actually I wasn't certain which service I'm gonna use for this project, so great you mentioned Coinkite. I'll have a look at their API :)
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:57:22
I did not type any mnemonics by my self if that's what you mean. But as far as I recall I used the option "reuse the seed from my Trezor".
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:55:07
Thank you, I'll send you an email and update here later what happened and if I were able to regain access to my wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:55:45
Great, haven't received anything yet though, but I'll keep an eye on my inbox :)
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:02:21
I'm not a 100% certain, but I think it reused the seed from the Trezor. I remember going through the wallet creation process there was something like "reuse the seed from the Trezor"
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:18:45
Yes my Trezor works as expected on myTrezor site. It still gives access to the same wallet there and my coins are safe. However the GreenAddress wallet doesn't. I assume it should be used the same way as myTrezor site, eg. plug in Trezor, type device password if any. Type the on screen Trezor password and you're in.
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:09:18
I think it will do allright. I've been running a node for almost a year now on freebsd using a dualcore atom CPU 1.8 ghz. The only time when I have experienced high CPU usage was when I just fired it up and it had to do some checking or what ever of the ~20 GB blockchain. That lasted a couple of hours and now it uses about 3% of my CPU, with 57 connections, but it has been as high as ~100 connections without any trouble (AFAIK).
