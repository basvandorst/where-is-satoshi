Watch out for Singapore. Government is crypto friendly, probably will happen soon
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:24:45
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:05:08
Oh yeah Singapore ����

If bitcoin is nothing, you shouldn’t and cannot tax it.

Beautiful place

Nice gif
@_date: 2019-11-21 03:29:53
Always unpredictable. And I thought women are complicated. If bitcoin has a gender, pretty sure wont be the one with a pe~nis

Crypto.com app. Buy, wallet, loan all in one
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:37:05
Last Friday of the month might dip again

Robber goes for skills upgrade. Be a hacker
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:59:26
Don’t know if it’s good news or not
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:32:12
Sad sad sad ☹️
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:44:51
That’s true adoption is good news. Getting people into the crypto space is the first major resistance. Once they are in, they’ll buy btc and other altcoins
@_date: 2019-11-30 01:26:55
Never do this
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:56:49
It’s like the designer just goes “ah phark it” and gave up halfway through.
@_date: 2019-11-16 03:15:06
Got a feeling people are holding back from investments. Too much uncertainty
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:47:00
Agreed. It’s gold v2.0
@_date: 2019-08-08 10:03:39
Bitcoin has problem maintaining 12K. Keep falling below.
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:44:30
Good times for Traders, bad for hodlers

I have a feeling his Wife loves bitcoin more than him
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:17:58
I have been waiting for 3 months for the big pump
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:47:34
Sue them
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:54:46
Sell them immediately ��
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:40:28
Use crypto.com debit cards. U can withdraw from atm5 machines. But I only used their earn feature for the sweet 8% interest
@_date: 2019-08-03 05:25:53
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:27:47
Go lower and I will buy more. No fear just hodl
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:41:24
I’m going to stay for 10 years ��
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:04:14
Nothing is ban in terms of bitcoin. There is always a way out
@_date: 2019-08-20 02:42:59
My HK friend thinks bitcoin is a speculative vehicle. They have no value and they don’t like to invest in bitcoin. ��
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:49:19
This is the nicest answer on bitcoin I’ve ever read. Cheers! Good job quitting gambling.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:20:58
Just bought into the dip. Now waiting for the pump
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:37:40
Thank you gift for being a loyal hodler
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:31:42
I’m worried about the 86,00
@_date: 2019-08-31 12:15:55
Thanks for making price goes up ��
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:58:00
That works too.
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:32:54
Bitcoin value increases. He might be betting my bitcoins will be worth 1 mil instead of 10k today
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:31:10
Too late, he could be dead then
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:50:02
Bro. U need to watch the movie “boiler room”. Vin diesel used the same scripts
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:05:01
I could have done that on photoshop
@_date: 2019-08-25 11:05:38
I would have died 10 times over
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:21:31
If he has bitcoins, he can afford to pay.
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:55:51
Yeah. It’s dead
@_date: 2019-08-07 05:33:43
I will turn to look straight in my wife's eyes and say, "SEE I TOLD YOU SO". 
Just once, I am correct.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:32:36
Well, what are they waiting for?
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:06:27
10 years hodl for me!
@_date: 2019-08-26 09:55:15
Price goes down, can buy more bitcoins. Price goes up, everyone’s happy. Sideways is boring. Cannot do anything.
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:19:50
I buy monthly regardless of price 75% of my funds. 25% I accumulate and wait for sharp price falls.
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:44:20
�� funny
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:01:55
They only like stocks and property
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:38:51
It’s a moon runner
@_date: 2019-08-04 22:31:52
No one knows. Just buy
@_date: 2019-08-30 04:02:18
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:36:18
There are apps and exchanges that help people like these. Binance and crypto.com, I’m using them. Good for people who are not so savvy like me
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:13:22
Burn! Stock market burn!
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:38:30
Don’t bounce too fast. I need to buy at good price
@_date: 2019-08-31 00:50:41
Portugal is beautiful
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:43:10
Yes. What other asset is so liquid that you can move to a new country next day and start spending? Not property. Not cash because you need to report for more than certain amount.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:23:25
Just buy and wait for the dump
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:28:00
I'm leaving my retirement to Bitcoin, it better 100X in 10 years. LOL!
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:36:14
Bitcoin moon as the market burns
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:22:43
I think every country will make their own coins if they are able to. I doubt a country will buy in when there are whales already in bitcoin. That will just make the whale insanely rich and risky for any country.
@_date: 2019-10-21 00:18:25
I hope so bitcoin moons to 50k and beyond
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:06:12
I have my popcorn ready
@_date: 2019-08-29 11:21:40
I’m so sad to see naysayers posts things like this
@_date: 2019-08-20 08:20:00
Go DT! Go DT! Go Go!
@_date: 2019-08-24 04:38:37
I wish it happens soon
@_date: 2019-10-11 06:36:01
I put it on my DOTA2 persona
@_date: 2019-08-06 04:35:37
Bitcoin cannot be banned. The country with most bitcoins wins
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:08:36
But price still around 12k-ish. Why?
@_date: 2019-12-20 04:47:36

Pump that bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:40:14
That’s cool. But I rather win 1 bitcoin. Not a house in foreign country
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:26:50
No one can ban bitcoins. Not even the most powerful job on earth.
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:00:00
That’s a lot of money there.
@_date: 2019-09-14 21:06:41
We will still be talking about brexit 10 years later. Keep delaying all the time
@_date: 2019-09-05 08:00:22
Lose. USD10. Win. Banker runs away

Hope u are right ��
