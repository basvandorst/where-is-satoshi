The mods told me that this was outside the scope of the subreddit and none of their business.
I am going to attempt to press charges for fellony theft however. Doesn't hurt to try

he made it seem that it was avoiding fees. i didn't catch it

$950 is Grand Theft in CA, where I live. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:55:42
Looks like it. Just deleted his twitter. 
Stupid stupid move. I even offered him to keep some of the money and return the rest. 
As Johnny Cash says "God's gonna cut you down"

Im kinda a country dude so trust goes a long way where I am from. I just hope he pulls through :( 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:32:35
nah man it really wouldn't feel right. As nice as it sounds, I can't bring myself to accept it. You can donate that money to charity if you feel compelled. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:04:21
PM me your bitcoin address and I'll send you a thank you for your help

Steeling 1000 is a fairly large number. While I am no a teenager, its a shitty thing to do to anyone regardless of age. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:07:45
Don't worry about the donation. It is very very kind of you but I'd just rather it not happen to others.
Im seeing what I can find
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:21:16
Shit man thats a steep tax hahahaha
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:40:51
ya. clearly a shitty dude
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:56:44
Ya, tough lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:17:49
Im just too trusting of a guy I guess. I hope others don't fall into that trap. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:29:27
Hey man, any chance you could pay up on your end of the deal we made? I sent you $1000 worth of BTC and trusted you and haven't heard in 24 hours... 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:57:18
No worries. I mean, it would definitely be shittier if I was 17. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:34:54
Can you please pay me? Instead of scamming me out of my btc and continuing to post on reddit?
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:46:06
He helped me unlock my bitcoin wallet from the past and offered to trade me 0.1btc for USD. He is an active member of the bitcoin reddit. The second I transferred the BTC he stopped replying and has still been posting on reddit. 
Obviously I was stupid to trust him, that is no question. But overall I hope he realizes that actions like that really hurt the bitcoin community because there is no chance in hell I'd ever return to it since I have no email, nothing, to back it up.

He refused to do anything with PayPal that guaranteed protection 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:28:14
Im not so sure. Let me check. Idk why I assumed I didn't have the program
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:43:29


Im not smart enough for this BTC stuff. It makes my head spin. I appreciate the money I've made but I'd rather convert it to cash in my pocket these days. Im sorry :( 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:37:10
Holy shit yes I had the program. I was able to launch it and import a backup. It seems to have found it because it had the one transaction in it. 
My next question is that will this program still work or what is my next step to get my money out (I'm trying to sell/cash out)
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:21:29
That is irrelevant and personal info
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:04:59
At this point I have no dignity left but a lighter pocket 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:42:41
Any chance I can get a old history of that post? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:29:30
Oh I am definitely old enough to know better. Im admitting my stupidity in being too trusting. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:28:19
Ugh that is infuriating...
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:04:18
I appreciate it man. Honestly I know its gone. He's gonna take it and run. Maybe I catch him, perhaps I don't. God knows, but I know God will bring justice. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:24:13
Good idea. He is nothing but a big harm to your community.
