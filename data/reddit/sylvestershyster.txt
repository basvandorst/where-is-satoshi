I'm happy i didn't sold 80% of my BTC for over 200, money would be stuck&amp;gone by now!
Still over 5000 and some BTC left :-/

Why not pay 50BTC to see a colombian peel the skin from...oh this sounds really weird and cruel :D

If you succeed with the first step and are able to access my bank account, all what can go wrong went wrong! Rest of your chain is totally indifferent.
Sure you heard of CC- and EC-card fraud using cash machines? Your cash goes POOOF to other countries, no BTC involved. And know what? Banks are accepting the risk because they include it in their calculations! You might get refunded by the bank, but someone has real FIAT in his hands.
Doubled the amount of FIAT money in the system within a few steps, too, nice job!

No official statement at 11.15pm CET on bitcoin-24.com confirming this

Looks like its him, doesn't it? And he uses the same nick on bitcointalk (and much more services like ebay, last.fm just google it!)

I'm the one who publicly considered some legal action on Simon last evening on bitcointalk, my nick here is heavily related to the one there!
Why i did it? Due to the lack of information was given over a few hours and to make Simon react! To make the flock think "oh...meeeh..someones gonna do something...meeeeh..lets graze the green grass and wait...meeh" and hope to keep other ppl from doing ill-considered things this way! Not to forget to save my/others assets hold in BTC24, if the law joins the game things will get MUCH worser and no one knows if we ever would get refunded!
Since we have an reaction of him, i won't consider anything that would slow down the process of bringing back BTC24 in a reasonable time...as long as he keeps us updated.
If he has losses he isn't able to cover yet, he sure will be in the future if BTC24 comes up again. Explain how to handle them, future pay-outs and so on, just keep us informed an we're all happy!
BTC doesn't need negative attention after the 2nd time ShitGox happened. We need reliable and competent exchanges (there will be FIAT at some point of the supply chain for a long time), i'm not happy with the fact if Gox coughs the BTC gets a bad pneumonia!
I say this as a miner since early 2011, not a trader!

If he's under protection he will be able to use a computer from an apartment anywhere!

Bitcoins aren't traceable, its the person who holds them and affiliated ones are!
Everyone will make mistakes sometimes that reveal his true identity.
I'll call every 12th from now on the Simon-Hausdorf-Rememberance-Day, and the net will never forget nor i'll never forgive!

YESSSS...if media catches it up, it will do some more damage to the BTC!
it won't accelerate anything, i know how our german authorities work!

His girlfriend deleted her Facebook! It is confirmed she is studying mechanical engineering in the next town, so i was able to locate her. Not exactly, but now i have some ppl working on this!
IF YOU DON'T COME OUT WITH THE COMPLETE TRUTH UNTIL 11.59pm TODAY (17. April) SIMON, I DECLARE MY PERSONAL MANHUNT FOR OPENED!

If he uses some wireless broadband connection, some ISPs share the IP on all users registeres in that cell. Its some kind of giant NAT they are using!
