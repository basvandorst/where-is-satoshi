There's a difference between FUD and being realistic about a meteoric increase in value. 
Regardless of the fundamentals, bitcoin has crashed and will crash again.

Stop losses aren't really the answer. For all you know his stop loss could hit and lock him into a massive loss when the price shoots back up the next day.
If you didn't come here knowing you could lose everything you shouldn't have invested.

You're killing half your capital so you're liable at that time for realizing half the total capital gain.

I feel you. I bought a couple grand worth of Bitcoin back in 2013 but sold it to make a down payment on a car.
I've spent the last couple months kicking my past myself in the balls.

Were any of you around a couple years ago? I have a suspicion that the next correction is going to put the others to shame. There is so much nub money in BTC right now.

What makes more sense to me is big money coming in to force a stable or increasing price. Logically I don't see why a whale would lose money crashing an asset to profit off a futures contract when they could profit off both by going long.

You can probably get away with it, but lying here means you are totally fucked if there's ever any problems with them.

Exact same here haha.
 In college I did the whole Ron Paul bit, but then I got into the real world and realized how shitty and incompetent most people are and that giving them free reign over society is fucking stupid. 
Every time I see some idiot trying railing about how taxation is violence and theft I cringe at my former self.

People take what he says like the word of god, but the problem is what he says is pretty common sense. I agree with the general sentiment of 99% of what he says, but a couple of years ago he called bitcoin a mirage.
He's just from a different world, he doesn't understand what Bitcoin is. I'm not going to take investing advice about blockchain from someone who probably has to have his assistant install updates on his phone.

If you talk about anything that isn't index funds or covered calls they circle jerk on your face too.

Well that was pretty fucking ballsy

Lol. The Chinese are just smart enough to recognize that crypto isn't stopping and they're just trying to put themselves in as good as a place as they can.
I'm under no delusion that blockchain will play out the way the creators want it to, but I also don't think the Chinese government gives a fuck about it's credibility taking a hit when they "change their mind" about crypto.
