Ok, so here is what I don't understand...
If your computer has to solve this algorithm to get the 50 bitcoins - the block, how come there is a limited quantity? Wouldn't the volume of increasing computers increase the quantity of bitcoin blocks being produced?
And, if there is a limited quantity of these bitcoins - how do new users get access to them to use in exchanges?

The whole reason that the paper wallet is folded up is so that people can't get to the private key without the owner noticing that it was tampered with.  This seems like it just discounts one of the best parts of the original design.

Ok, I understand.
As much as I support using bitcoin for currency, how can a company sell a product if the value of the BTC is going up and down so frequently.  You sell a $100 product, and a few days later, the BTC that you charged is only worth $85.  It seems too unreliable for a business.  How is that type of thing controlled?

Why don't you just buy on an exchange?

So, does each snack send that BTC to a different wallet with a unique barcode?
