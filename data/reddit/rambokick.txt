U will first need to go to Fed (or some other Govt authority) to store your physical Gold stash and get a certificate from them. Then u have to approach NASDAQ with that certificate to float a gold ETF. There, u'll set a face value, that u think is correct. Thereafter, market will decide everything.

I empathize with PBoC. 
Since Long March, they have come a long way. They disciplined the biggest population on earth to be the biggest economy with the strongest currency on earth. They were marching towards the right direction to compete with USD. 
Now, from nowhere a new currency has come up with a tech that was never heard before and challenging them. They are not idiot. They know very well, that if something is to be done, it has to be done now. If this bloody new currency can grow and reach the critical mass, it is game over for them. They have also figured, that they can not kill it either, as it is headless. So, they are taking right steps from their perspective. First make it dependent on China and then control it.

I do understand that. But, when u create a diagram for public, it is better to mark those 0.13.0 Core as non-SegWit+non-BU or at least QT. People generalize Core as SegWit, though we know Jihan is more inclined to anti-Core (not BU).

May be it is worrying. But post-UASF, it was inevitable. UASF is just trying to hijack consensus and force an opinion on bitcoiners. Miners are merely acting to resist the forceful hijack. Pre-UASF, most miners were neutral. But, UASF has forced them to activate BU to maintain sovereignty. As a neutral bitcoiner, I support it.

To be technically correct, this is wrong. Number of unconfirmed Tx on mempool varies from node to node depending on the mining fee based filter criteria set by that node. So, if a node set filter criteria as 100 satoshi/byte, they dont have more than 4mb of Tx (~15000 Tx) on their mempool.

Absolutely true. But, this does not mean raising block size will solve the problem. 1 MB blocksize allows ~220 million Tx per year, which is not enough for even a city, let alone the world. ~1 billion Tx per day may meet the need of a large metro area, which requires 1.6 GB blocks. If u want to allow 7 billion people on earth, doing just 2 blockchain Tx per day, it would require blocksize to be raised to 24 GB. Hence, raising blocksize is NOT a viable solution in the long run.

I think, in the long run, market will always try to discover the true value of bitcoin. By true value of bitcoin, I mean the real cost of producing 1 BTC.
If the above hypothesis is true, the  current value of bitcoin, i.e. $1100+ is not at all sustainable at this difficulty. The difficulty must rise a lot to sustain this price in the long run. Otherwise buyer will soon discover that mining is more profitable at current price than buying from the market.

For every fork u'may get at least some hash power behind u for some time, however minuscule it is. The question is how much hash power is backing a fork. If it is minority hash power that is backing it, but still enforced, then it is nothing but a centrally planned fore feed feature update.

When u patent something, u are not legally obliged to declare it as defensive. It is just a public statement to pacify immediate sensation. ASICBoost has not yet been used in any commercial purpose either. In China, has his own patent.

Hashpower determines the longest chain with most work done. 10 people or 1 person is immaterial here, as long as they are honest, i.e. not attempting a double spend. That is how bitcoin is supposed to work.

Yah. English is not my first language. Hence I'm aware of communities that uses bitcoin but does not get the chance to speak about UASF. I believe there are also similar communities in various languages which I dont understand. Hence, I dont trust any other voice than those can be reflected on blockchain, i.e. Hash Power and Coin Holding (though this second one is disputed).

When we have let CPU-GPU to sunset and allowed ASIC, which is probably million times more efficient, to rule the mining show for so long, how can we raise 30% advantage as a reason to ask for more commitment from miners? 
I understand, SegWit will do great for us. But where is the rationality to ask for these new commitments from miners?
This appears to be an efficiency upgrade through R&amp;D, which any miner could achieve. Just like some upgraded to FPGA from CPU/GPU, some did not. If we ask for more commitment, it would be like someone placed the ball in the goal and now we are trying to run with the goalpost!

UASF has nothing to do with the voiceless. All it does is rely on a centrally trusted group of people to define *economic majority* and then take blockchain in the way that centrally defined *economic majority* wants.
Bitcoin Blockchain is not communism that I'll advocate for the voiceless without significant hashpower or coins. Only people with significant hashpower or coins has risked their skin for the best of bitcoin and hence bitcoin should take that route. Bitcoin blockchain has nothing to do with an mBTC owner who spend 24/7 on reddit to show his voice.

Depends how u look at bitcoin. If the only need of bitcoin to u is to visit porn, then only buy what u'll use soon. If u look at it from an investment instrument, then regularly buy small amount. If u want to use it as a trading instrument, then buy small and try to make profit with it and use that profit to buy again.

Even if u make it public, we need to **trust** you that those deposits/withdrawals were nor made by you.

If I have understood u correctly, u term it as *exclusive* as it is patented. For a miner manufacturer in Asia, a patent in US/EU is non-existent.


Not directly. Miners benefited from this are acting against SegWit because of it. True. But, 1mb limit placed in 2010 on normal block size (not SegWit block) also gums up the protocol and prevents improvement. Are we changing it without consensus? Then, how can we ask for new commitment from miners without consensus?

Again a very dicey phrase like **beyond overwhelming**. Why do we need phrases like this or **economic majority**? These are NOT quantifiable.

**Economic Majority** is a **Hoax**. There is no scientific way to quantify the voice of economic majority. In China &amp; Russia, if Opium sold against bitcoin makes more volume than coinbase or bitfinex, we'll still not be able to hear their opinion, though they are the true economic majority. Hence, no decision should be made based on the very concept of economic majority.
