The cancer that is Bitmain continues to multiply.

They put him on the spot and asked him. Not that big of a deal, relax.

Breadwallet is great. I've had a back and forth with someone on the team there on this subreddit before. Very receptive to my wishlist and they actually added some of the features :D

I know you are joking but the 440 wasn't made for people that can't afford the M4. The M4 is track oriented with a harsh suspension, not everyone likes their kidneys dancing every time they run over a bump.

If it could be replaced on a whim then the exchange space would be very crowded. Regulations + security compliance are massive costs.

I sent 80 sat/byte on Thursday and it didn't confirm until today.

The fee is actually low for what is considered a high risk transaction.

Fees were pushed higher by the BCC agenda, they would never have any success if they couldn't give example of why their coin would work if the network was clogged with real transactions (likely won't happen for a long time with real transactions)

Apple has a velocity review. This doesn't work. The reviews will get removed. They know people do this.

Don't even bother asking because you are going to get biased misinformation. There are two large parties right now trying to determine Bitcoin's future and they are extremely divided because each party has different incentives to push their agenda. No matter which side you pick, all you need to know is that they are both are shooting themselves in the foot and the price of Bitcoin reflects that and most likely will continue to reflect that as it falls and as more alts are issued and then converted to BTC and then exchanged for USD.
Feel free to mark this post as you wish but if there is a chain split, I assure you the market cap of both chains combined will not exceed the all time high that has currently been achieved. Confidence is waning and alts are rising. The downfall of Bitcoin, like all economic systems, is greed.

I've given Overstock plenty of business. They have been one of the first to bravely accept Bitcoin and have always supported it. Awesome management and directors.

Illinois has no control over fiat though. Why not just say the United States?

A split coin will most certainly result in Ethereum market cap leader headlines

It's too late the bad news is kicking in. Here comes the motherload of sell offs. I'm expecting a sell off to 2k. Anyone that pretends this is healthy is fooling themselves.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:07:48
Yeah this isn't going to pass. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:15:07
This is a garbage article I'm upset I wasted my time reading this. It offers no connection between Illinois being in poor financial shape and how Bitcoin will solve this.
