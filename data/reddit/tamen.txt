I will :)

Dammit! I only have 0.14BTC in my Breadwallet. Anybody feel like selling me ~0.02BTC? I have Paypal or Mobilepay/Swipp if you are from Denmark.

Simple game. Didn't test the withdrawal as I lost it all :)

A normal job and a good exchange/localbitcoin.

One per costumer so big miners will not buy them all. But they are made to be mounted in a rack so targeted at the big miners :)

So one ounce of gold is as valuable as one ounce of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:13:06
But... If the blockchain fails, how will i use my bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-08 12:42:17
Done.

But there is also electrons in gold. Are the electrons in gold worth more or less than the electrons in Bitcoin?

Well... They didn't specify who the rate were best for.

Thanks. It worked nicely.
One thing you could change is that not the entirety of the addresses is visible in the text fields.

I third this.
Other than them having downtime when asshats decides to DDOS them, I have had no problems with them.

If you are good at it, you can put them on an exchange and sell them when the price is high and buy more when the price is low.
There is also faucets.

It's behind a registration wall.

I was refreshing like a madman to see those comments. Thank you for the clarification.

No! See, that's where they get you. You have to pick a number between 1 and 6 (but do not use a die!) and then skip that number in the list every time.

You drizzle your DNA everywhere you go. It is really not something secret. Hashing your password with something "not secret" does not improve the security of your password.

Brilliant! Doing them all in a random sequence is the most secure. A moving target is the hardest to hit :D

5$ plus a wifi dongle. There is no network on the Zero.
