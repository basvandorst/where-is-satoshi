Why is distribution an issue?  When I research a crypto, I look at, can I make money off of it?
And they will raise the block size.. keep in mind that currently, they only get 1 transaction per second, and can currently support 7 transactions per second, they've got some time.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:27:22
Yeah but what if they eventually don't convert their crypto and stores begin using is as currency as well the way we would all like?  How do we ensure taxes are paid.  I'd like something along the lines of a FairTax integrated into the coin, which Geolocation to tell you which country it is being spent in.
@_date: 2014-09-24 20:06:07
You are talking about a 'traditional' 51% attack where the attacker builds a separate branch on his own.. I'm talking about a different type of attack.
Most miners confirm the first block they see, as long as the transactions in that block are valid, correct?  Let's say I own 5% of the mining power and I promise people that if they pay some small fee, say 0.5% of the transaction, then I will attempt to include it into the network in my own block.  So for a 0.5% fee on all transactions, I will include the double spend 5% of the time.
Also, note that I am only talking about successfully getting an instant transaction, but then getting a double spend confirmed..  I'm not talking about waiting for 6 confirmations, which is still safe.  But Instant Transactions are a necessity for long term success, which is why I feel like Nxt will have the upper hand once I finish implementing them :)
@_date: 2014-01-18 01:03:36
Which is why personally I'm vouching for one of the Proof of Stake alt coins such as Nextcoin (or Peercoin)..  such a waste of money and energy to power those machines that is totally not needed for Proof-of-Stake cryptos.
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:59:42
You should look into Nxt.. that one is instant.. just not yet accepted as widely.. or really anywhere yet.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:15:20
If all they have to do is flip it on, many, many merchants will.. because why not?  You're making it easier for people who want to pay that way and the customer is always right.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:23:54
That's not going to work.. governments can easily be convinced to make Bitcoin illegal.. good luck convincing them of the same thing when it comes to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:28:30
Will this really affect the price of Bitcoins?  I mean they've already bought them and seperated them from the Mt.Gox, BTC-e, Coinbase, etc. coins right?  So we won't be directly selling to them.  Right?
@_date: 2014-04-17 03:45:12
Yeah.. that 0 confirmation transactions are going to kill Bitcoin.. good thing Nxt exists.
@_date: 2014-04-01 00:09:41
Love the basic idea.. except for the cashback part, why would I ever buy Bitcoins from Brawker, knowing that they cost 7% more than they do anywhere else?

World GDP is $85 trillion
He's predicting that Bitcoin will be an equivalent of $10,500 trillion?
Somehow I'm not buying that..  unless he thinks that the US dollar is going to shrink that much that the USD becomes worthless...  but that's not exactly a fair comparison.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:26:35
I know.. most people think it's bad, I realize it's good.. so I win cheap coins!
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:09:21
Notice that they are going to put up daily/monthly withdrawal limits because they know that first thing everyone is going to withdraw their money as fast as possible as soon as they re-open.
@_date: 2014-05-03 23:57:55
Can we beat them to it by giving people a decentralized anonymous id that would still hold onto all your important data across sites or something like that?
Being optional, I'm not totally opposed though I could see that changing..  also, I see this being very similar to OpenID or facebook login or using your gmail account, which we already have and people aren't exactly rushing to get them.  I'm not sure what this adds.
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:50:15
Let's say that is the issue for most people.. then all the initial founders will have to do is sell off their shares, make money in the process and make all the rest of theirs more valuable.. I just don't see it as that big of an issue.
Though granted.. nobody knows if they are actually selling it, or just moving it between multiple accounts.
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:47:58
Transactions are instant.. confirmations are not.
Why cost prohibitive?  Write an app one time, sell it to others and fake all your transactions.
Isn't it as simple as filling an empty wallet with the exact right amount, then emptying it into multiple accounts all at the same time?
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:17:18
I would make sure you have a copy of any private keys also on a piece of paper stored somewhere safe.  Keep in mind in rare instances USB sticks can fail, especially if you store it there for 5+ years.

Right now it is true.. but this is the prediction whenever the next halving of Bitcoin miner fees is.
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:50:01
Good point, though reversing a transaction is certainly a hassle since it typically involves getting an entirely new card.
Plus if an alt coin supports instant transactions.. isn't it still a huge positive for that coin?

@_date: 2014-02-12 18:25:11
Check out Nxt.. it's got that potential.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:58:59
I think that it's a chicken and egg problem, we need more places to accept Bitcoin, before we see people adopting it and vice versa.  But there are a lot of people who love the idea but simply don't see it succeeding or still feel it's too much hassle.  I think the more it stabilizes and becomes easier to use, the more we'll see people adopting it.
It'd like early smart phones, I don't know about you but I didn't see why anyone could possibly want one when the first came out.  I still don't have one yet mostly because I figured I'd wait for my old phone to break and it hasn't yet but I definitely want to get one.
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:38:08
No.. because Nxt is better and I'm using it instead ;)
And no it's not just a get rich quick scheme.. even at Bitcoin's size, Nxt uses about the same amount of electricity as 12 households.. Bitcoin uses the same amount as 1/4 of the state of Vermont.
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:03:18
There are some who believe that Bitcoin will win or at least stick around for a long time just because it was the original it'll always be around to some extent, if just as a store of value.
But could be, Nxt looks promising.
@_date: 2014-08-19 04:56:04
Yeah he was smart.. he had access to all of the coins BTER sold.. he took Nxt since he though it was the most valuable ones he had :)
Then he realized he'd kill his own investment by killing Nxt if he hung on to that many Nxt.. so he traded 85% of them for Bitcoin.. and cashed out the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-19 01:43:06
He returned them in exchange for Bitcoins..

After the third or fourth time they asked me to rescan my passport and driver's license because the resolution wasn't high enough or the image wasn't zoomed in enough or whatever, I decided it wasn't worth using them.

Obviously they are afraid of the competiton... and don't be so quick to say that Bitcoiners don't do the same thing.  Seriously anyone here try adding a post about how much more energy and cost efficient Nxt is and you'll notice it always ends up being down-voted very quickly!
@_date: 2014-09-24 05:09:56
It sure is!  Proof of Stake to the rescue!
Did you know that Nxt uses 10,000 times less energy to power the network and is also much more cost efficient?
Or that Bitcoin uses more energy than facebook?
Old and outdated article, use the newer hashing rates and you'll realize just how ridiculous it is, source:

Have you heard of Coinbase ?
Exactly what you are talking about, Fiat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:32:02
Not only that but we need to figure out things such as which countries is it legal in and which have ruled it illegal, figure out better bank security or  something FDIC like to reassure people their money is safe.  At this point it's still risky because there are a couple of really nice alt coin competitors, such as Nxt, which could beat us, and that risk is factored in. Point is we've got a lot that still needs to be figured out.. once it is, market will choose a price and it'll mostly stabilize, probably at significantly higher for a couple of crypto currencies but in the meantime.. yeah it's pretty unstable.
@_date: 2014-01-18 14:19:59
Especially once we half or cut off how much money we're printing and injecting into the system...  Nextcoin doesn't have that problem however!
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:10:53
Yup, my money's mostly on Nxt.
@_date: 2014-08-18 03:02:54
Proof of work has problems when it comes to scaling.  I don't think Proof of work can have both low transaction fees, high security, and even nearly profitable miners, once Bitcoin stops printing money.
My money has flipped over to Nxt's proof of stake as the one with the most potential to grow and I mean really, really grow.
I suspect there'll be multiple ones, regarded the way we have multiple religions, political views, or currencies these days.  They will apply to multiple philosophies.. maybe a more libertarian coin, maybe one that allows roll backs.  Also all these coins have their own communities surrounding them that have invested into the coin themselves, then thrown themselves into growing the coin.
Even Satoshi was stating that he didn't think that any one currency should be the only currency.  He didn't think that Counterparty should be on the blockchain.. he thought and developers seem to continue to think that they should remain on their own chain to limit blockchain bloating.
I don't think Bitcoin will die anytime soon either.  Look at the community surrounding it.
And I think we're better off if we do have multiple currencies.  Competition is always good and isn't that a large part of the reason Bitcoin was started in the first place?
Also.. keep in mind that of course Bitcoiners want only one to survive, because they believe that will be Bitcoin and it's part of the hidden agenda of many members to scare people away from other cryptos.. same is true for all cryptos.. or any investment.

@_date: 2014-02-08 01:28:42
You are talking about the negatives of democracy and I'll agree it's not perfect but what's the solution?  Maybe we can figure out a decentralized government solution, where you agree to be a part of various 'governments'. 
Ideally I'd like people to be required to pay their taxes but they decide where the government is allow spend their money and if not enough people are willing to spend their money on corn subsidies.. then sorry corn farmers you can only grow corn if you'll make a profit doing so!  Huh... I wonder if I can turn that idea into a crypto.. seriously might start working on tax coin, were a certain percentage of every transaction is automatically take from your transactions, VAT like, but you also get to vote where that money is spent and the tax rate would be sent by the people voting on what that fixed percentage that everyone has to pay would be...
Kind of like voting with your dollars.
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:12:06
Disagree regarding the 'extrapolation method', seems to me it'd actually be cheaper than that which is calculated by it because as you continually add more and more machine, other people are going to be less and less profitable to the point where they start losing money and will actually start pulling their machines off of the network.. so I'd actually guess this number is a little high.
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:43:19
Edit:  we are the next PayPal
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:53:50
I don't understand what kind of attack you are talking about.. how would someone go about attacking Nxt(or peercoin)?
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:29:38
Good point...
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:43:41
I still don't understand how Bitcoin can be a currency with such a long amount of time needed to wait for transaction confirmations.  My money's on NXT.
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:27:14
Not really a problem per-say, it's just that it isn't designed to be a store of value, for example anytime you transfer any number of Peercoin's anywhere, you pay 0.01 PPC to do it
Plus Nxt will allow you to point your forging power at other accounts, this is nice because it means that you can have 500 people forging aka Nxt's version of mining on server's that could handle credit card volumes and other people just point at various server's and in return are given a percentage of the money earned by those servers just by pointing at them.
And where Nxt could get by with 300 Servers (though I suspect they'll add many more), Bitcoin needs 50,000 servers of that same level of power because they need to protect against a 51% attack.  More servers means higher energy costs and transaction fees.
Oh and they are promising instant transaction verification, instant of waiting for 10 minutes for a block to go through.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:42:23
It's worth a try!  We know they are going to fix this problem, right?
And honestly, if that's what happened and this attacker is shorting Bitcoins.. isn't it the best move we as a community can make?  At least vote this post up even if you don't buy any.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:06:10
Yeah but walking away with a Cheeseburger should be possible without waiting for one 10 minute transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-18 01:06:11
True and that's partially the point of the article.. is that those miners are useless for anything but mining.  But still.. that's a lot of energy and equipment being used to support Bitcoin that could be used for other purposes.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:03:37
Sorry my bad.. meant supporting instant transactions, not reversing them, I totally agree there. It's been corrected.
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:22:46
Google is an open platform which allows anyone to use any apps.. it's basically like every Andriod is jail broken.. because they believe in giving users the freedom to make their own choices.. which is why they aren't doing anything one way or another.
Apple on the other hand is in charge of approving or denying all apps.. so if these apps are illegal, potentially they could get in trouble too.
I don't know about Microsoft.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:18:12
Hopefully they were early adopters, so they got in cheap and hopefully they don't have 100% of their BTC's on Gox!
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:29:19
So Bitcoin adapts.. basically just needs to change which encryption algorithms it uses.  And if Bitcoin goes down because of this.. we are in major trouble anyway because so will major banks after getting hacked.
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:52:41
No...  Warren Buffet's just heard of Nxt :)
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:08:15
Good point.. that would be nice if someone came up with a way to quickly check for double spends and seems doable.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:41:22
I will argue that once they price stabilizes and more people start accepting them as payment, and keeping them in Bitcoin form instead of 'cashing out', that they are significantly easier to spend.
They do have an intrinsic value for that reason the question is how many people actually have a feel for what that value is and how much of it is simply buy at whatever price, because it will go up when the guy decides to buy more at a higher price.
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:28:42
That's why proof of stake coins come into being IPO style instead of mined.. well except PPC.
Eventually Bitcoin will get to the point where it is entirely mined at which point.. why is there any more incentive to mine a single chain for Bitcoin then there is to mine a single chain in Proof of Stake.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:21:41
Government is a bubble.. interesting.. it's certainly been a big bubble but who knows.. maybe cryptos will indeed free us from government.
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:35:04
Peercoin maybe, I did hear they had some central nodes that they hoped would be temporary.. I haven't done as much research regarding Peercoin as I have Nxt,  but Nxt finds other nodes the same find that Bitcoin does, no central authority nodes needed:
No central authority needed.
@_date: 2014-01-18 04:38:56
That's why you should check out Nextcoin, very energy efficient!
@_date: 2014-07-11 22:19:14
Have you hacked N yet?  Please keep telling me how you are going to hack N which requires owning 51% or more of the forging power to do...  and that's before some big changes that are coming soon.
Nobody has N attacked Nxt.
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:06:59
Yes but how are you going to secure the micropayment sidechain.. with proof of work?
No Nothing at Stake can be defeated, one of the things Nxt has going for it is that if they decent the same forger(aka miner) is trying to work on different parallel chains, ban them from both by including proof of his cheating!  Easy solution.. if you have any one honest forger, then the cheating N forks can't persist to become long enough to cause a problem.  Not to mention, that the way nxt deals with it is by making it tricky to create a valid N fork.. you'd have to have ~51% or more of the network gang up to do it.  So no.. N is not a killer issue.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:36:45
Yes but nobody is going to give Mt. Gox their Bitcoins when the price is that low and they could sell them somewhere else.
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:06:16
I've seen that but are there really only 118 pools?
118 comes from adding number of addresses that have relayed known blocks + number of addresses that have relayed unknown blocks.
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:36:55
If it pays off and you have this kind of news..  hell yeah!  I mean it's not like it's going to crash if they don't announce it tonight.. maybe it'll just go down by $50 per coin which is 6% of it's growth.. and be back there a couple days from now.
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:08:58
Good luck switching Bitcoin over to use Nxt's algorithm faster than Nxt can grow to overtake Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:17:41
Really love this idea.. I've tried to figure out how you'd make something like this work myself.  I'm convinced it's impossible.
Problem is, if you run a gateway for them then you can spoof a request as coming from any of your clients.  The spoofing that you sent a request from someone else's phone is easy. Then because this relies on the a pin that is known by both the gateway and the user, it means that anyone running a gateway (which can be anyone who owns a smartphone) can both spoof your call as coming from them as well as also use the pin that is known by the person running the gateway.
And you know that somebody out there who has access to someone who has connected their 1000 BTC wallet to this application, will make for a very nice target.
Therefore.. if you use this, people running the gateways can steal your money.. unfortunately :(
Maybe I shouldn't be sharing this and just keep my eye out for an opportunity to steal a few thousand BTCs.

I agree that Dark Market seems like a really bad idea for Bitcoin to purpose at this point.. wonder if that's why the prices dropped again.

I seriously am interested.. I do not understand how BTC can succeed as long as it as these issues.. Proof of Stake is necessary to fix these issues.
That being said, I do own a few hundred thousand nxt, because it is indeed a better coin.
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:08:59
I should point out that you might be interested in Nxt.. basically you do get paid some interest as long as you use your Nxt, either directly or by pointing your forging power toward someone who does forge.
Please don't censor this post.. Bitcoiners seem to vote down any post discussing the advantages of their competitors.
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:16:46
I mean for comparison, Satoshi Nakomoto has a large percentage of Bitcoins than anyone has of Nxt and Mark Zuckerberg owns 30% of facebook.. and I realize that this is a little bit different but it doesn't mean I'm not going to use it, if it is superior and it does have superior techonology.
Also only 8 people actually put in a full Bitcoin during the intial funding call.  I think they've got a much better idea than anyone else, and let's say that the distribution does become an issue, won't they just sell it all off? And if anything they've got a bunch of people who have a lot at stake and therefore will do whatever they can to help it succeed, right?

5 percent of mining power via a mining pool.
You can promise miners that you'll pay them more than other pools because you'll also have people paying for double transactions.
Or one of the pools that exists could decide to implement this.
Point is, could be done for a lot cheaper than a 51% attack!
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:04:24
Yes, meant confirmations.
That's exactly why I think that another alt-coin may beat Bitcoin at it's own game, NXT is looking promising to me.  Only one person at a time is actually confirming transactions, then propagates them to the network.
Not that Bitcoin won't always have a place or is going to crash or anything like that... just not useful in all situations.
@_date: 2014-01-01 05:18:50
paper wallet... because if you store something on a hard drive the hard drive will little go bad within about 10 years and that information may be lost forever and unrecoverable.  Probably not true after 5 years but I wouldn't risk it.
I would also backed it up with Bitcoin Armory on a external offline device.
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:23:42
Let's put it this way, Bitcoin uses $15 million of electricity everyday to power the network (source:  )
When you break that down, that is $10,000 worth of electricity per minute.  Nextcoin can currently handle just as many transactions per minute as Bitcoin can and I'm sorry but no laptop uses $10,000 worth of electricity per minute to power it.
Yet the Nextcoin can handle just as much traffic for maybe 1 cent worth of electricity for that minute? (and I think that's definitely overestimating)
That kind of difference in electricity costs definitely means Bitcoin transaction fees will have to be significantly greater than Nextcoin transaction fees.

Keep in mind other coins are competing with Bitcoin.
I'm with Warren Buffet, Bitcoin may not be the winner.
History has shown that 1st isn't always the winner, I'm convinced Bitcoin is like VHS, Myspace, Netscape, Yahoo Search, Netscape.
Check out this article:
Point being, Bitcoin shows a lot of promise but be careful before you throw all your money into it.

@_date: 2014-01-18 04:37:55
Well.. in this case, I probably do believe you.. it does seem a little unlikely that that much computing power is being used to power the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:27:34
I agree, decide whether or not you think the technology will revolutionize the world or not and how high you think it'll get in the long run, then buy low, sell high.  I'm currently stocking up, I actually think the IRS ruling was great for example, it confirmed that there are no issues with buying, selling, and passing around crypto-currencies.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:33:33
You know that someone is definitely going to write a wallet that allows you to easily document exactly what you need for every transaction, right?  The price that you bought in at and the price that you sold it at.
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:17:21
Yay! Free advertising for Coinye!!
If it comes up again, they should offer to settle in Coinye.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:05:11
Given the current wallet setup.. but basically all the wallet does is send a message saying I'm spending this many coins from this address.  You can send similar messages to multiple addresses.
There is a reason why the confirmations exist, which is because without them you can potentially double spend.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:03:16
Among other reasons, one reason I think another coin will take over for Bitcoin in the long run, Nxt for example is currently working on proof of stake instant transaction confirmations that give you a very high probability of a transaction being a real transaction.  As in, initial calculations show it could be cheated once every 30 years by someone with 51% stake.
@_date: 2014-01-18 01:09:40
Maybe they can make them more efficient but why will hashing ASIC's necessarily require significantly less power?
They definitely won't require less power than the PC's already running anyway that maybe 3 times a week pays you a little bit to support the Nextcoin network for a minute at a time.. if your computer happens to be on anyway.
And Proof of Stake doesn't have the 51% attack problem.
@_date: 2014-07-04 02:41:20
You ever hear of Proof of Stake?  Asic's gain you absolutely no advantage when mining Proof of Stake coins.. which I would call ASIC-resistant.

This is exactly what the Winklevoss twins were expecting to happen if Bitcoin was ever going to take off!
Probably were expecting a nation a little bit bigger than 11 people though...

Would be nice but yeah.. I'll grant you are probably right.  Definitely not in our(or his) lifetime...  maybe once we colonize mars, and a couple of Jupiters moons.
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:48:20
You mean, only provide API keys to it and it does the trading for you?
Interesting...  little wary of trusting anyone until I've gone through the code myself or some other people have tested it.
Of course.. that's the same attitude I had about buying Bitcoins for $20 and didn't get in until $350 :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:20:24
Or maybe just because you come off as a little arrogant?  Good for you regarding making a lot of money day trading but especially after reading that article and a couple of your comments.. that's the way it seemed to me.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:30:18
Yeah but if you have 10GH/s available.. surely that won't support the world, so there must be a limit.. what is it is the question?

@_date: 2013-11-30 16:45:57
Totally agree!!
Also, a lot of people don't realize how easy it is to split up Bitcoin and think you need to trade entire Bitcoins and I think this would emphasize that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:49:14
What about:
Is it worth waiting for the price to go down a little lower before buying back in?

Why would he ever need to sell it... it'll be the world's currency!
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:23:55
Wouldn't that be nice :)
That being said you never know.. could be worth $900 some day when Bitcoin is used widespread as everyday currency!
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:07:17
True, but it means that Bitcoin has a definite place and there are definite times where Bitcoin is superior.  Plus I've already been bouncing around an idea for a new website that would fix that problem.

Are you forgetting about the great Firewall of China?  Not going to help this situation...
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:57:05
True.. you'd probably need some kind of escrow service.. which could be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol.  Of course in that case you'd be paying a transaction fee in order to use it.. so maybe it defeats the purpose of not using paypal but there are solutions.  Basically it has all the advantages as well as disadvantages of physical cash (except it doesn't seem that it can be counterfeit)
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:36:27
Yeah but when you want to withdrawal.. you get a voucher which would have to sell to someone else?  Sounds to me like the Chinese government is requiring that withdrawals not be permitted after Chinese New Year?

I had a dream just last night that Al Gore invented his own digital currency.. he called its basic unit of value an internet :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:16:37
I think in a sense forcing people to wait for a week is nice and it'd be nice if all exchanges did that.. because as much as I personally don't want my money locked up, it lowers volatility and day-trade style trading.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:36:59
I made the same comment separately but I'll make it again because it directly addresses this point.  The way I see it, right now is the time to enable as many places as possible to accept Bitcoin, even if they need to convert it to cash for risks sake and make it as easy as possible to spend. 
Once the price stabilizes they'll be a big flip when more and more businesses will just stop converting it back into fiat and more and more of us start being paid in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:28:34
Luckily, you can buy just about anything you want to with Bitcoin, there even are doctors who accept it!

I disagree.. currently you do need to put dollars in but the taking Bitcoins out, agree.. it's not needed.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:55:23
I'm a little late to the game on this one.. what happened?
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:52:38
Wish they'd called it digital instead of virtual currency but still pretty awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:35:04
It'd probably take about 8 man hours to implement.. 20 hrs to test for securities sake.  But yeah, I think they could assign one guy to do it and it'd be done in a week.  And definitely mean more business for the and everyone else in the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:58:25
Nah.. all those small earthquakes release the pressure and keep the big one from happening.

You could always buy your own miner and connect it somewhere else..  
I'm with you though.. that is scary and something should be done about it.

I've got just the cure for you!
Give (or sell if you must) me your Bitcoins, with a nice discount built in, which will show that you are not greedy!
You may have a couple of what the hell did I just do attitude, but you'd find that slowly more and more you'd stop thinking about Bitcoins!  Win-Win right?

What do you possibly gain by switching your subscription status on and off?  I'm obviously missing something...

You ever see a chart of a bubble popping?  It dips below the correct market price then once it stabilizes and people aren't worried about losing all their money because it's been dropping for days.. they buy back in and it returns to the correct market price..  then slowly continues it's upward trend.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:53:19
I talked to a service representative a few weeks ago who told me that they were in the process of setting it up.. I'm sure it'll happen.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:58:52
Interesting.. I'd say likely actually legal because the law states that individuals may buy/sell Bitcoins as much as they want.. businesses can't.  And he's an individual!
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:34:41
Or you think it has something to do with this?
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:15:59
Making Bitcoins seem more affordable to your average person is a reason I think it might be time to 'split the stock' if you will, check out this post:

For now the Chinese government is saying it this way but if this doesn't kill Bitcoin.. they'll keep trying.  They've made it pretty obvious they are anti-Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:44:02
And it's hard to have that intuitive feeling until prices stabilize.. which will be a while.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:54:00
Nice introduction to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:44:33
I disagree.. they could still tell people their payment is going through and the item will be shipped as soon as their Bitcoins are processed..  Just wait to ship it until the Bitcoins are confirmed.. same idea.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:33:02
So price is probably about to go up or down rapidly in the next couple days depending upon what happened?
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:03:16
You really should change the title of this post considering how nice they were to you... seriously they gave you a really nice deal.  Give them some good PR for that instead of leaving this up.
They are a really good company in what I've seen and heard about them.
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:49:23
Definitely an improvement!
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:33:04
Bitcoin does have a couple big benefits that ordinary cash doesn't however, specifically limited supply and backed by something that can't be manipulated by governments and doesn't seem like it can be counterfeit (if it could.. the whole thing would come crashing down.)
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:28:56
Who says that's a bad thing..  get em cheap when they bottom out!  They'll definitely go back up again...

Not only is he a fan but he obviously wants to own some Bitcoins via your purchases!
I heard in another article that he is considering not cashing all of them out to fiat but rather wants to consider keeping some of them as Bitcoins owned by Overstock.com(he said maybe 1% of their revenue).
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:52:10

Still using a dumb phone and I was trying to decide between getting an iPhone or Android.. thanks for making my decision easy Apple!
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:58:45
I disagree..  think of the brick and mortar stores that would like to implement Bitcoins.. wouldn't these guys have the perfect solution for them?  Therefore you'd also have Bitcoiners advertising their service for them to these stores.
One other positive is that they can trust that PayTango will pay them where as with the whole double spend, takes an 10 mins to an hour to confirm the transaction.. potentially they could get cheated using other ways of paying.
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:45:41
two means one right?
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:49:39
Yeah.. but seriously it's better than the yuan as shown by the performance it was getting before this news hit.
So if they did it, it would probably take over as the world currency and they'd make a bunch in the process!
Like I said.. mostly kidding.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:08:12
If you are accepting payments.. why do you need multiple addresses?
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:00:56
I'm with you... as long as it's volatile they can exchange it for cash and then accept it (or maybe 90% cash?).  Once it loses that volatility.. then start accepting it as Bitcoins.  Would Bitcoiners possibly know the difference regarding what's going on behind the scenes?
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:58:23
I recently emailed my family members explaining Bitcoin to them and we definitely need more people spreading the word. Nice going!
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:18:14
The catch with regarding the remittance industry is that people often buy Bitcoins, send them to family, then cash out in their own local currency.  That doesn't mean that it doesn't have huge potential however.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:35:30
untrustworthy how?
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:02:04
That's why at the moment they can instantly convert it to fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:31:53
I disagree it's not about being confusing, I think the average person logically knows that they are the same thing but it they go onto Coinbase, with $100 they can afford in Bitcoins then when they have to decide whether to buy 0.1BTC.. they're more likely to pass.  But buying 100 mBTCs.. they feel like they are buying 100 things instead of 0.1 things.  It's all psychological.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:04:55
Sweet!!  Thank you BadBoyNDSU!!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:39:08
I'd say time to put at least 5% into fiat... won't be able to get it this cheap by the time you hear that news!
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:38:13
I suspect they bought a few Bitcoins first too.. and figure this will help increase the value of those coins.
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:11:27
Had the exact same idea..  in fact I'd like to create a website that allows people to create and gift a wallet to someone else, it would also explain how bitcoins work and give them places they can go to spend their new bitcoins.. or allow them to invest in saving up and buying more bitcoins.
Do you know if there is a place and way to make and gift bitcoin wallets?
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:16:32
You got it!
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:19:38
Excellent point!
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:55:54
You have any ideas as to how that is going to work?  It'd be awesome to be involved with making such a tool.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:43:58
Why sell?  Wait it out and a couple years from now, it'll be worth $10,000 a coin.. then you can consider selling.. unless you want to wait for it to get to $1,000,000 per coin!

What about pricing it in RMB and converting it at transaction time?
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:10:42
Keep in mind that many of them merchants instantly convert it to dollars.. so they don't actually take any more risk than they want to.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:04:17
Maybe you missed the half priced Bitcoins sale sign?
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:32:43
The way I see it, right now is the time to enable as many places as possible to accept Bitcoin, even if they need to convert it to cash for risks sake.  Once the price stabilizes they'll be a big flip when more and more businesses will just stop converting it back into fiat.
