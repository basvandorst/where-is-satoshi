I pulled at 989 , perfect timing
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:43:23
I tempted , I thought it was gonna drop because of those 500 bitcoins but it stayed , then someone listed a bid with 120btcs so I got relieved and then 300 btcs were bought off the 500
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:09:38
Thanks alot :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:23:42
seriously welp , it was 1200 now 1250 ?? ????????
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:09:44
really? 
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:22:20
what's the point of downloading and running a full node of bitcoin core? 
What's the point of doing this 
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:37:53
Thanks for the gold :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:13:21
my sister was behind me but thankfully she was looking in her mobile..
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:13:57
Thanks , this has clarified some stuff but .. what is blockchain wallet? does it use core ? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:47:36
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:49:41
I sold at 1266 after it stopped at 1350 :'(
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:07:14
This would be very hard to do for an average bitcoin user. There should be an easier way so the majority of the bitcoin owners could use.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:22:55
what is happening????? 30$+??
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:33:24
that doesn't give me an an advantage as an individual , right?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:10:30
NSFW guys , dont open...
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:08:32
I know this well get downvoted anyways because of people just looking to achieve what they only want but I completly agree. All we needed is a compromise for both sides and we got it with segwit2x. We will get this 2x sooner or later
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:29:16
I did and I have used them before but they pretty much dont offer any discount.
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:49:46
How did that happen?
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:49:50
How did that happen?
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:12:41
I'm a newb when it comes to btc tbh , but I mean I wont store it for a long term so I think I should be okay
@_date: 2016-09-13 13:48:06
is localbitcoins safe?
@_date: 2016-09-13 14:03:00
it can be done online. what im saying is , is localbitcoins a nice (not bad) wallet that I could use to easily send my money to my national bank?
@_date: 2016-09-14 11:30:23
are there any fees when sending and recieving btc?
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:54:25
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:12:11
Thanks , ill be careful!
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:11:47
thanks alot 
@_date: 2016-09-14 10:17:20
So do you reccon making a wallet like blockchain and one in localbtc and recieve the btc on blockchain then when I need to cash it out right away send it to local btc?

Attacking s2x team + embarcing core devs.




It's because we don't need a third altcoin and it'll be easier for s2x to go mainstream.


Another not needed point because it's not true.


because of core dev dogs
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:28:46
Just another core dev dog. Doesn't have a legitimate reason. All of these are literally political and none are actually technical. UASF was much more dangerous yet followed it. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:58:59
Do you think it ships to africa?
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:12:48
10-20 atm but sometimes it goes up to 100+ during congested times
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:35:28
So pretty much the only real reason behind being against this is because of removing core devs from the scene?
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:37:13
So the real reason attacking it is because of the devs? What about the block increase? Isn't this a good needed thing?
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:32:34
And yes , I'm not entirely educated on this matter but there is literally no REAL reason for preventing this upgrade that convinces any sane person.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:15:01
Are you really believing what you are saying?
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:12:13
In order to go mainstream we need a block increase until lightning network is done.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:07:50
I just did. There is nothing out of these , a real reason why segwit is better than s2x.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:11:35
Because idiots following the core devs without a real reason why segwit is better than s2x are the ones slowing it down. When people realise it's the upgraded chain , they'll follow it
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:09:56
All you are doing is either attacking the dev team behind segwit2x or u are stressing on the point of not having replay protection , which is simply not implemented because we don't need a 3rd bitcoin altcoin and they want segwit2x to be the mainstream because there is no reason for it not to be . It's simply an upgrade. Tell me if I'm wrong.

@_date: 2016-10-16 20:38:52
Hey Max , Thanks for the fast response and thanks for helping me. I'm a newb so I don't know much about localbtc so thanks for clarifying that it was a mistake. I was wondering what would happen if I trade to someone a btc for cash deposit , this won't happen right?
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:27:33
desperate for cheap coins much? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:47:48
if you are serious , you are sitting on a real fortune of more than 100k$ if it was done early 2011. Please don't trust anyone with any single detail 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:29:19
Thanks for the suggestion. Will blockchain wallet work the same incase of a split?
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:39:26
No, not again please. Last time we asked for this it lashed on us.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:19:28
He didn't ask for how much you are holding. He asked how long do you think is long term holding for bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:19:36
I know it might not be good safety wise but incase of a split I could be able to spend my coins on both chains right?
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:03:56
what is bitcoin cash and why is viaBTC doing this? are they disagreeing with segwit or what?
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:03:05
Then how is the 2x gonna be implemented to get activated after 3 month from locking segwit in? by Bip 91?
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:08:43
jeez you suck..
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:43:51
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:49:15
Jeez you guys , what the fuck is wrong with you , this shit is on both subs. We finally got a compromise after 3 years. You won't always get 100% what you want. This shit you saying right now is just non sense..
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:49:15
not because you got out at the peak once , you are a god. Now you are just gonna think you can time the market perfectly and buy at the bottom but you probably won't succeed at it. Just Hodl instead of trying to time the market
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:41:47
Sure , but I hate the people saying segwit2x is bad or we should fork off instead.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:10:44
There is not much time to prepare for it because of BIP 148 , Miners only agreed to it right now because of uasf. A chain split with 3 coins isn't something someone would want , the best option right now is to prevent this from happening by implementing segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:30:32
Jihad is fighting the enemy in the name of religion. For example , if there are terrorists that killed your family. You are a muslim and you go kill them ( the terrorists) , that's called jihad (fighting the enemy). Jihad doesn't work the other way around with Isis , they think they are doing the right thing but they aren't.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:40:19
I know but that's not what I meant by what I said , look at title ''segwit2x isn't for you'' , that's what got me triggered
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:14:05
none , he is trying to get it for a lower price
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:06:00
waiting to buy now , aren't you?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:57:45
I'm in the same boat , but I still would like to know if I should buy more now or later if it drops with reasons on why or why not it would drop
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:13:39
Why would you prefer a chain split over the same but with no chain split. Let's just move on with segwit2x and if there wasn't enough support by the end of july , we could then pull out the uasf card
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:42:57
just? this has been out since mid may
