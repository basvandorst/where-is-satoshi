"It appears bloomberg etc are saying its a close call but futures might be a bit bearish for Bitcoin - but this doesn't make any sense to me because you still have to buy Bitcoin to short it."
Bloomberg etc have no idea.
"BUT as I said you still have to own Bitcoin to short Bitcoin, so the theory has to be that wallstreet is all buying Bitcoin now so they can short it right away? But everyone else is buying Bitcoin now because for the first time it is becoming properly legitimized as a financial instrument and an ETF is likely to follow once futures arrive."
This is incorrect.  You don't have to own bitcoin/ or borrow bitcoin to short a futures contact. That's not how futures work.

The aim is to accept any Crypto Currency in real-time at the point fo sale through a decentralized network of participants that enable real-time payments &amp; authorizations. Graft does this through a network of Supernodes( similar to masternodes) except they earn rewards(fees) for authorizing network Transactions.

Graft aims to be a decentralized version of Visa/ MC and was co-founded by someone with well over a decade of experience in the payment industry.
