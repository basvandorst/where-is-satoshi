I blame the press/media for even indulging the "offended". Why on earth should those idiots be given any attention at all?
This guy has already achieved more for humankind than every one of the people that chose to be offended put together.

Well, here's my effort:

Cool, I can invest my lose change with this.

Even as a bitcoin noob I know that the value of anything is determined by the price at which someone is willing to pay.

Yeah but if the treasury of US or China suddenly decided to grab as much money as they could and then disappear with that money, wouldn't you have *some* trepidation about the safety of FIAT?

I came in to say pretty much the same thing as "TotesHuman".
Glad I didn't now.

Stop trying to make changetip happen, it's not gonna... oh, actually it looks like it will.
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:39:24
...which is why you have concerns about FIAT and feel the need to voice them. The example doesn't even matter, the fact is the largest bitcoin exchange got jacked just a few short years ago and he's perfectly entitled to have concerns because of it.
You'd be crazy *not* to be concerned about it.

Could someone with incredible patience ELI5 what forking is?
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:36:31
Whoops! Prepare to be downvoted for pointing that out.

Thanks for the tip but for some reason that didn't work for me. Not having the best luck with bitcoin!
I clicked to collect the tip, it went to the changetip website which asked me to login using social media, I chose to login with my G+ but when the changetip page loaded it just says 0 balance, 0 received.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:15:36
Thanks, I'll give that a try.
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:26:54
Hey, sometimes ppl just need an explanation.
@_date: 2015-10-11 12:41:12
What have you got against people?
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:17:09
It's just "people" is the only word you shorten. How much time is it saving you?

It turned out that I had previously registered with my reddit account but inadvertently created a new account by signing in with G+. 
Got the right account open now, thanks for the tip!
