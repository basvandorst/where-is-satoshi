I mean as long as you do everything correctly there shouldn't be anything wrong with sending them all to 1 wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:26:21


This is basically the one relevant point in your entire post. Which makes sense, and I can appreciate that view.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:16:28
My thinking is not that there would be clear collusion but an underlying understanding that this is what would happen
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:26:47
I think its naive to think that it'll be impossible for them to find someone to go long.
(Not futures, but the concept applies) I mean look at 2008 for example, some banks were able to secure credit default swaps against others while they literally knew for a fact the market was crashing.

Well my personal opinion is to sell sometime on Sunday before 6pm, take advantage of the run up but don't gamble on the release of these contracts. Just my thought.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:37:03
Well I'm just saying, you said a lot of blah blah before you got to the true point. This is really a good point and something I didn't look at.
Don't get all offended.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:29:10
Gotcha. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:06:08
So in no way is it possible to change the nature of BTC without a fork?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:37:35
I honestly was having this discussion with my friends earlier today and wanted to post it, I hadn't seen anything about it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:21:40
I know absolutely nothing, still learning the space. I'm asking a question I haven't been able to find the answer to online.
Thanks for the input though.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:25:44
If it was the majority though, would regular BTC then become a fork? And the new BTC would be the main coin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:40:29
Not sure how this is fud. And nah I actually don't hold any crypto, just been searching around and making random posts to stir up some people.
I trade traditional equities.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:07:51
1) Well the valuation of 5k BTC is an extremely high number
2) The contracts themselves don't actually matter in regards to BTC's price, firms can accumulate as much as they want of BTC, and dump it all at one time, to take advantage of their futures contracts. Which is what I'm referring to.

Interesting article. But I've also seen that certain pools have already been capable of mining multiple blocks in a row on their own, as well as the fact that China itself owns the majority of BTC mining power. Believe it's even over 60%.
Just because it's fast doesn't mean that the tech isn't owned by more than a few people, as far as I can tell at least.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:05:51
Not at all. I don't mind being labeled an asshole, or the nicest guy you've ever met. To me I am who I am and my opinions follow suit. It's called being confident with who you are, regardless of what others say or think.
Though, if we are really evaluating who the asshole is. Aside from one snarky-ish comment I made responding to your original post, only one person has been the asshole, and that's you.
So if you really hate assholes that much, go look in the mirror and give it a punch.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:03:26
To each his own my man, best of luck.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:05:19
Who is to stop the mining reward protocol from being changed?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:23:01
But in this scenario, the 51% would be original BTC and the 49% would be the hard fork no?
And let's say they were able to obtain even 80% or higher? Then what happens. If and when quantum computing comes, even 90%+ is a real possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:17:35
That is, unless said miner can control 51% of the nodes? No?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:08:31
And that's why you're not me.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:09:05
Well like I said, if 51% agree on something, it becomes reality. So the greatest strength can become the greatest weakness if the 51% become too centralized. Which let's be honest is a real possibility.
China itself already has more then 51% of all the mining power globally, I don't think it's an unreal threat.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:23:45
Like I said, my question isn't whether it's good/bad etc. I'm wondering if it's possible.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:30:45
Definitely going to be interesting going into the future. Thanks man.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:26:19
Yes sir?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:03:40


@_date: 2017-12-08 02:59:28
Oh, and I see you didn't even write that post yourself, just copy and pasted it from someone else.
So my assumption was actually correct, interesting, feels good when that happens.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:27:27
Is it possible that through sheer computing power at the hands of only a few firms/corporations, that even with a decentralized system it becomes centralized?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:16:11
Well, too me, if a person or group of people can say my transaction is valid or invalid, they pretty much own the coin. I see your point though.
Sure it had a lot of backlash, but my question is, is this possible. Not whether it is good, bad, or has been attempted.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:09:59
Why is it that you cannot change the underlying rules?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:41:11
Lmao that I do. But I'm genuinely curious on this one.
You say the BTC accumulation part is zero sum, but its not. Futures are obviously, but you cant just blindly assume everyone has access to the same amount of money to prop the price up or down.
And I'd also just want to point out. I'm not talking about the BTC going to 0 or anything. But if a firm has accumulated a few hundred million of BTC, that's enough to move it a good 5-10% if they sell off, which is a nice gain on a short position.
Also what's with people going through post history all the time lmao, just have a convo like an adult, clearly I'm not simply trolling you like the autists on the IOTA sub.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:54:55
Rage about what though? You are swimming in such mass amounts of BTC gains, and so much superior knowledge. How could a post from someone who knows nothing, and is simply asking for differing opinions, get you so mad?
Is it possible that you are an extremely insecure individual, who actually knows much less than he claims to, and likely doesn't have much to look forward to outside of raging at people on reddit?
Nah, can't be. You keep doing you big guy.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:57:02
I love how this guy go onto r/all for saying shit that isn't true lmao
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:12:31
The futures themselves are zero sum sure. But the argument people are making isn't about futures and whether or not they're zero sum.
The argument is that firms are accumulating large amounts of BTC now, will then go short via futures, And then dump their BTC position.
And I get your argument, but yes for every firm doing that we could assume there is another firm going long futures with the ability to buy mass BTC to spike the price.
But if there is an imbalance in either direction on the BTC accumulation side, not futures, then we could see it affect the price.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:50:13
I'm actually just a university student. I understand quite a bit, but I don't know everything. Hence the bottom of my post "open to other opinions.
You are a very fun person to mess with though. So enveloped in his own belief system that every differing statements get you very angry, so cute.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:36:46
Nice argument. Please explain
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:00:21
It's a differing opinion, what he's saying is possible, but just like what I'm saying is possible.
Either could happen.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:58:28
Yea it's a risky spot, always tough to call the top perfectly. 14 was solid.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:29:44
Interesting, I don't fully understand this enough to know if this means it's truly impossible or not. But I appreciate it nonetheless.
