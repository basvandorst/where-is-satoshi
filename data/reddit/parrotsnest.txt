More security? I don't understand.. I was told Bitcoin was secure, unlike the evil bank money I typically use.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:03:55
not surprising considering the entire price of bitcoin is due to speculation.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:17:26
..but you also reassured me Mt Gox was the safest bet in town...
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:25:57
I'll think about it..
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:25:48
Enjoy that denial. Bitcoin is built off  poor economic logic, until that changes, it will fail. And if it somehow actually becomes a widely used currency, the adverse effects will be extraordinary.  Good day.

YOU DON'T SAY! Why was that even necessary to post? Did I say it didn't? Does $250,000 not cover enough for you? If it doesn't, put your next $250,000 in another bank. How much does Bitcoin cover again? Oh that's right, nothing.
Look, I did my thesis on capital to risk weighted asset ratios (and essentially the Great Recession), so please don't get me started on that subject. There are issues with capital requirements, but in my opinion they are opposite to your worries. Currently banks are held back by capital restrictions, and essentially forced to unload their dead money to buy treasury bonds instead of investing it in productive means.
As for the Financial Crisis, I think more of that has to do with government regulators forcing banks to give out bad loans to people who could not afford them. Now what you propose is essentially a Bitcoin bank that does not invest the funds, merely sits in an account and collects dust (because obviously no bank is going to pay you a return on your funds if they cannot use the funds to make returns with). You suppose that the funds to run a Bitcoin bank will most likely come from service fees or transaction fees, in which you will be paying a bank to hold your money, and in return offer no interest rate. Sounds like a genius idea.
The blind faith in this subreddit is astounding!

Has Bitcoin lost another 50%? I mean.. paradigm aside, that's efficient right?
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:37:08
Well IF I was going to buy Bitcoins, now would be the time. Anyone who paid near $1000 per Bitcoin must be feeling like an idiot though... as they should. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:27:27
Quick price check confirms, $266. I better start exchanging my U.S. dollars ASAP while there's still time. All hail the efficient and ingenious Bitcoin. XD
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:05:27
And what accomplishments do you have sir? ;)
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:59:12


This thought process is exactly why you lost a heap, man.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:02:52
Actually I have a masters in economics. I actually contemplated doing a PhD in Monetary Economics at George Mason, but I realized that some of their professors had absolutely no clue what they were talking about (see your post). ANY economist that does not see an issue with deflation, expected or unexpected, should instantly have his degrees destroyed. Do you actually think that the U.S. dollar does not have controls to make sure that it's supply is not controlled? The key word the economist you cited above is "elaborate." The U.S. dollar has not been deflationary for a long time. It has however had inflation issues, due to those people in charge of the controls misusing them, and let me tell you, there is no wrath like deflation, when compared to inflation. I'm not worried about anyone taking me seriously, because see, I actually study this stuff for a living, unlike you. The bitcoin subreddit is full of wannabe Anarchists who have NO clue how monetary economics work. Since you want to throw around posts from economics, I'll leave you a few from a Nobel prize winning economist.  And one more thing, when linking to explanations of bitcoin, you should really try to hide your bias more and not link to wiki articles on bitcoin.it ;)
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:34:37
I think you refuse to believe that no matter what evidence is provided. This is not a matter of correlation not equating to causation, this is definitive proof, with your own eyes! I understand wanting Bitcoin to be successful, but blindly ignoring the facts is well.. ignorant. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have some good fundamental ideals, but as a whole I do not believe it to be an efficient currency. I guess the bright side is that once it has failed, it will be provide some lessons for how to improve the next cryptocurrency. The only problem with this is that I believe the improvements will merely put it towards the current fiat currency we already have.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:45:16
Trying to wake people up, and keep them from wasting their time, energy, and money. Is this subreddit only for cheerleaders of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:48:22


I don't see how taking the loss too lightly makes him susceptible to extinction. XD
edit: on a serious note, I agree with you on the point of suicide. However, I think people need to think much harder about the risks involved before they shell out 10K+ in Bitcoins. Greed in such a market has its risks.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:45:29
Says the guy who probably has Bitcoins locked away with Mt. Gox right now, which he most likely paid a much higher price. Good call, never ask an idiot (you) for advise. ;)
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:11:27
Can you still buy bitcoins on Mt. Gox with credit? I might actually buy one if the price gets low enough. Or is there a huge risk in getting involved with Mt. Gox right now?
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:06:41
What does that even mean? It's already a thing. Good luck with your loss.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:23:42
Fuck the rules!
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:46:21


Ahhhh good ol' news reports. I forgive these guys under these circumstances.. news reports and all. Anyone else? :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:48:48
Maybe someone should post Leah McGrath Goodman's address and intimate details in an "investigative report," see how she likes it?
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:58:31
How much did you lose?
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:15:15
Well that'd be actual reporting, so...
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:04:27
Well the empirical evidence has shown that, yes, it is inherent to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:16:13
HA! What assholes, don't they know Bitcoin is where it's at. NO clue how they made their millions, probably investing in *safe* investments.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:29:08
So the code controls general price levels? Unless Bitcoin was the predominate currency, it would still suffer the ills of inflation as any other good. The price of Bitcoins would go up, but each Bitcoin would be worth less in terms of real goods it could purchase. IF Bitcoin took the stance of slow and steady inflation, I'd give it kudos for that, but that isn't the case. Right now Bitcoin has taken the stance of setting a finite number of Bitcoins, which is deflationary and even more of a problem than inflation. The other issue here is that what should happen and what actually happens are two different things. The U.S. was on a gold standard for a long time, but the problem was that they did not abide by the gold standard they laid in place, leading to the Great Depression.  
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:51:01
Fundamentally, Bitcoin is still flawed. People are starting to wake up to this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:33:31
You're kidding right? Inflation is the % increase in the price level. What do *YOU* think inflation is?
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:37:38
Or lack thereof. I see you're a DJ, that's challenging. XD
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:05:39
I'm being lazy today.. so I don't want to type out all of it's flaws. But the main ones are clearly price volatility, limited supply (deflationary), security issues (as we've already seen), waste of resources (putting computer resources into "making" a bitcoin is unnecessary) etc. It's just a horrible idea for a currency, and is starting to look like a bad investment even.
edit: down votes and no rebuttal, go figure.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:16:34
Refute ONE of my points.. just one. I bet you cannot.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:10:27
So then how is a U.S. dollar itself less secure than a Bitcoin? And what is the point of having a secure Bitcoin if the exchanges or banks themselves are not secure? Serious questions.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:12:01
Burn. ha.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:32:58
Banks are insured. You think USD loses purchasing power? Have you seen the price swings in Bitcoin? Its purchasing power goes up and down erratically every single day. I don't see how you can possibly list that as a negative for the USD, but ignore this for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:11:09
When you say they are stolen, do you mean Mt. Gox stole them? Or what do you mean? I'm still trying to figure out exactly what's going on with them..
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:47:52
Please explain that to the guy in this subreddit who lost 14k and almost killed himself.
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:55:24
Correct. You take him to court, and that's that.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:18:16
They are flaws for Bitcoin when Bitcoin is supposed to be used as a currency. Are you seriously arguing that A) Bitcoin price is not volatile or B) stability is not needed for a efficient currency? 
I should really throw away my maters degree in economics at this point, since I keep getting schooled by experts in the bitcoin subreddit. XD *rolls eyes*
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:43:13
How is its value immune from inflation exactly? I'm honestly curious to hear how, because I keep seeing people saying this. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:57:38
Hey Buttercoin_Cedric, James Freebles here, Buttercoin President. You're fired.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:12:10
Oh, so it's not about Bitcoin being more secure? I could have sworn I kept hearing how safe and secure Bitcoin is..
So Bitcoin is safe because its a) decentralized b) unregulated? Honestly I have no clue how anyone can argue that centralization produces less security, or how UNregulating something would provide more security. *mindblown*
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:10:23
I can respect all of that. No big deal, we all come off either circlejerkish or jerkish, it's Reddit. :O
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:45:50
OK good to know. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:02:05


Sure you will.. ;) It's not all about cheap electricity, it's all about the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:42:06
That makes ZERO sense. Nice try, troll.
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:33:56
Apparently. I don't get it. *shrugs*
@_date: 2015-05-07 00:33:59
WTF kind of logic is that?? Property cannot be guilty. Property is a fucking inanimate object!
@_date: 2015-05-07 00:37:22
Bitcoiners aren't smart...
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:16:08
Well you don't understand basic economics, I get that. Clearly this subreddit is full of idiots, or else they wouldn't think that Bitcoin is a currency.
@_date: 2015-05-07 00:39:16
It cost *you* money. Clearly that machine charges a fee for its services. You've essentially lost money for nothing.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:11:32
Can you still buy bitcoins on Mt. Gox with credit/debit? I might actually buy one if the price gets low enough. Or is there a huge risk in getting involved with Mt. Gox right now?
