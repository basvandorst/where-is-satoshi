Take the 64% now, worry about the rest later imho. Even if that means lawsuits later, etc. It's not like taking the current deal is akin to accepting a class action settlement - there's plenty of time for all that to come. 64% now is better than ??% in 3-4 years.

I don't know what Carlos' suicide has to do with this - that was an entirely separate, and entirely real event that shocked everyone, especially his family. I personally know people who were in touch with his family, etc during that time - there was never anything fishy about that, just intense sadness by all. Typically when one commits suicide, it is not an event covered by the press, so really not sure what you're getting at with that part.

That makes sense. And yes, I am a daytrader (and really new to all of this), so thanks for the explanation.

I think the hidden question being asked in this post is "Do bitcoin exchanges need regulation?"
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:18:18
It doesn't help when people like you don't educate them.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:48:21
If you want to xfer in and out every time you want to make a trade, and pay them their fees, sure. But I think most people hold their trading balance on exchanges, so that it is their to trade whenever they want.
The market is to volatile to see movement, and then say "Oh! I should xfer BTC to BTC-e and make a trade! And then I should withdraw when I'm done, and repeat again when I want to trade again!"
Seriously. Nobody does that. It's too costly, both in time and fees.

How to determine trust if we don't even really know which country they are based out of?

Fair enough, there was just no other evidence offered at the time other than that photo. Which is understandable given the ban of media coverage. Glad to hear the turnout was bigger than it appeared to be.

@_date: 2014-05-10 12:14:48
I was simply pointing out that the title of the OP was misleading at best. "Great turn out *despite the ban on media covering it afterwards*"
It was not a great turn out. The pic shows barely 100 people there. The turnout was dismal. Keep on downvoting me all you want, however the OP's headline is simply like China FUD in reverse as far as I'm concerned.

Wouldn't it just be easier to take $9K of funds you already have (I'm assuming) in the UK, buy the bitcoins (like through Bitstamp), and then transfer the $9K of Paypal USD to yourself in the UK (or even to your US counterpart who can then just send a money order for 50 cents + PP fees)? Why do your investors need to be involved in this process?
EDIT: The reason I ask, is because you yourself have specifically told people to never, ever use Paypal for crypto transactions, and called them idiots iirc.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:21:32
Yes, because spelling no longer matters. Especially involving a story of mistaken identities.
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:53:34
If that's really the total number of attendees, I'd say that's a weak turnout. Dogecoin conference easily had twice as many. The conference was advertised without restriction - only yesterday did they say that no coverage was allowed of the event. 
Makes me wonder if all that Huobi volume is from overseas investors taking advantage of zero fees?

"Just imagine if hackers used this exploit to steal massive databases"
I don't get it, what makes anyone think that they didn't and they aren't just sitting on it?

They weren't transparent either, other than a hat trick once last year to prove they had bitcoins stashed away.

@_date: 2014-02-27 14:41:39
Of course not. And downvote my reply all you want ppl, but when someone makes a post saying "Do they have the right to be anonymous" what is really being asked is "Do we need to regulate them?"
I don't think we do. I think ppl should make their own decisions, for better or for worse.

IIRC, Ohio has a weird law not allowing the trading of non-currency for alcohol. The new casinos here had to jump through a lot of hoops relating to the use of casino chips in regards to alcohol.

Bitfinex recently did a third party audit IIRC, and prelude.io also recently released an internal audit.

I think the point of this conversation is, now that we see what has happened to Gox, has anybody changed their mind about that line of thinking.

You have to read it closer, it doesn't really ban gift cards. For example, I had a gift card to the grocery store, I used it tonight to buy a case of beer, because they fulfilled the requirements listed.

So, you're saying that China has banned Bitcoin? Because regardless of what you're saying, the headline will psychologically make people think this imo.

Every state gets to make their own laws regarding the matter.

10's of thousands of BTC are traded every day on exchanges (and elsewhere too). It would not be that hard to move 4700 at current prices, so long as a little patience was exercised (not dumping all at once).

The thing is, dogecoin has well over 100,000 users. They are the community. They don't necessarily understand the technology behind cryptocurrency, but are willing to embrace it and give it a try nonetheless. 
Why shouldn't they have "fun" whilst learning? Maybe if bitcoin was more "fun" to the masses that also don't understand the tech, it would have a wider and faster adoption rate?
