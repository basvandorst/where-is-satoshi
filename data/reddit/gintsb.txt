I am no expert in economics, but my understanding is that a small inflation is easier to control and stops hoarding (hodling if you will) which encourages spending, investments and consumerism (which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you look at it). But the problem arises when the inflation gets too big too quick. Which is why you are right, saving money in fiat is a horrible idea, because the inflation will just eat up the savings. And essentially just 1 bad event in like 30 years could ruin many life long savings.
I just have a hard time imagining how our system would work without an inflationary currency and that is why I have a hard time believing that Bitcoin will be our only currency.

That is why I've also invested in Ethereum. I don't personally think that a deflationary currency can work in our society. And a small inflation (up to 2% is good for the economics as it encourages spending).
Ethereum in the end will leave it's inflation rate at 0.5%-2%, which is good imo since there will be no government to control the inflation rate which will probably make for a stable growth and a widely trusted currency because it will have a known inflation rate and no risk of hyperinflation. 
That is why even though many see bitcoin as the future be all and end all of all currency. I think it will be more like a general store of wealth and we will use another crypto for every day purchases. Similar to how gold and paper money works these days. Except that you could still pay with bitcoin if you chose to, but you would rather buy it to save for rainy days.
And storing money is something which is not really possible for the average person outside a first world country due to high inflation with their currently available assets.
