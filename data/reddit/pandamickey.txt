No, banks cant deal with bitcoin. They can deal with people who deal with bitcoin. The people prohibited were the 3rd party processors, i.e, so that it HAS to go through a bank.
God this is a massive game of broken telephone.

his heavy trust let us dare not give up. As a company, we have always considered to comply with national laws and regulations is a fundamental obligation, our lawyers have always believed that, as the company's business, a large amount of funds into individual cards, illegal fund-raising, tax evasion, embezzlement, and so on legal issues . Under the joint efforts of our lawyers, accountants, engineers, and we finally opened a public company general households and recharge system based on the company accounts. Make sure the site prompts strictly recharge, fill in notes, according to the fractional amount of money, or it may be delayed arrival time. We are always prompt the user, there is a great investment bitcoin risk, regulators approved a new recharge way if we do not know, please control risk
The important part. Sounds like they can recharge now. They could have given up, they didn't, they had a trust, so they consulted their legal team, started their own processor, and if you don't follow their method your funds may be delayed. And then a disclaimer about the risk with BTC miuch like BoC. Good news everyone.
