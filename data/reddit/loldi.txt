Alright ignoring it.

The site uses the storenvy ecommerce platform, anything more specific and Id have to get back to you as I'm on mobile now. It doesn't offer the greatest flexibility in terms of customization but it was free to use. If it's too annoying I'm going to consider switching to shopify which already integrates with Bitpay.

Thanks for mentioning this. I had seen it but wasn't sure how "legit" it was (no offense to the creator). Just want to be as secure as possible.

Not working on my 5S using Safari, gonna try it with Chrome.

Thank you, I will be in touch!

Ok thank you for your advice. It looks like there may be a workaround option using coinbase. If it doesn't turn out to be useful, I'll either wait or switch to a service that already integrates with Bitcoin.

The site is [tee2thedome.com](  The bitcoin options aren't up yet as Bitpay still wants to verify my information.  I do not run a bitcoind.  I would be holding btc after the sale, not converting to fiat.  I try to spend smaller amounts where I can (mostly buying reddit gold with it, actually) and then replenish that amount + little more.  I currently hold a little over 2 BTC and, as this is a side business, I'd like to accept bitcoin vs USD if I can. If there isn't a good way to integrate payments into my current platform I'll have to consider changing formats since I'd really like to accept bitcoin and add to the list of places that currently accept it.

When I scan/upload a QR code nothing happens. Maybe it's my picture quality, I'll recheck

I've read through all the guides/websites that talk about them, but I still am having trouble wrapping my head around paper wallets and how to properly create one.  I also have an iPhone and AFAIK there is no app that allows me to use them properly.  I understand the basic idea, but how does my public key on blockchain get linked to the keys on the paper wallet?  
  
Edit: thanks for the info guys, gonna give it a go now and download the android app on my nexus 7

On the plus side I learned how to access my wallet in German, so that's cool.

It's pretty simple but it does the job.  Once you start to get a better grip on swift you can upgrade the look and feel to fall in line with iOS 8.  You should consider adding a price ticker or some values from exchanges.  Anything to increase functionality.  Good luck

Will this allow me to process orders easier than just a standard Bitpay button?  My biggest concern is ease of use and not having Bitcoin checkout be a hassle. I don't mind having to submit the orders manually after payment, but I want my customers to feel confident and comfortable when checking out.
