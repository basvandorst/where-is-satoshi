thats not the correct analogy.  You can't spend the money from a credit card transaction until after it has cleared and settled.  Like, say you got paid $50 dollars via credit card.  You wouldnt be able to deposit that 50$ in your checkings account until its finalized (and then it'll be more like 47$ tops)

@_date: 2015-06-21 03:18:25
right but most consumer devices have very little memory now.  Most people use mobile devices and lightweight laptops like the macbook air.  it has already become marginally impractical to run a full node from those devices, pushing for bigger blocks without fixing the real problem is just further marginalizing the problem and will lead to nodes becoming centralized due to resources required just like what happened with mining pools.  I was *for* block increase at first when I was reading gavin's blogs but as I kept reading it and the dissenting views of other bitcoin devs I changed my mind.  It irritates me to no end that the solution to bigger blocks for gavin's blogs always calculates the cost of paying 10 dollars per month to run a node on a remote server.... i dont want to pay 10 bucks to be my own bank, thats the kind of fee I was trying to get away from when I got into bitcoin in the first place.

If you don't think slightly raising taxes can lead to a better more productive economy where you make more and your money goes further (and your whole fucking life last longer) you need to log off r/bitcoin and take some 100 level economics classes.
edit: here's a simple example, nothing to do with healthcare.  pretend you live in a small island of 100 people that is near a large city that has tons of jobs.  89% of the people in the island work in the city.  To get to the city they have to take a bridge through another town to get to the bridge to the city.  People want to slightly raise taxes to get directly to the city, so they can have better jobs, shorter commutes and bring home money to the other 11%.

I'll help because I can tell that you're new, but looking to learn and this thread is really, really childish.  Welcome, there is lots of good in Bitcoin community, but reddit.. eh...


When you make a bitcoin transaction you sign the bitcoins over from a public key you control to another public key using your private key.  At this point your bitcoin node (or the bitcoin node of your wallet provider) relays a transaction to the other bitcoin nodes it is connected to.  Much like when you download something on bittorrent you connect to multiple peers, the bitcoin network is made up of a mesh of nodes.  
At this point, the entire network is not aware of your transaction... it is true that you may be able to see it as unconfirmed on blockchain.info, or your friends wallet, but that is only because they are connected to a node that has relayed that transaction to them.
Now on this mesh of nodes there are special nodes called miners, that take in a list of transactions, and the hash of the last block and try to find a special new hash that starts with an arbitrary amount of 0's determined by difficulty.  Since the old block's hash is included along with the new transaction this forms a 'blockchain'.  Once your transaction has been included in one of these blocks, it gets its first confirmation.  Additional confirmations tell you how long the blockchain leading back to the initial transaction is.  


What you can do is a double spend attack.  When you publish the transaction that signs over the bitcoin from public key A -&gt; B, you could also, at the same time publish another transaction signing it over from A-&gt;A.  So you could maliciously show the hotdog vendor the A-&gt;B tx while at the same time pushing another transaction.
How does this situation play out?  Whichever transaction the miner picks (sees first) is published in the next blockchain. While, its fairly random there are some factors that can be influenced, such as flooding the network with the transaction A-&gt;A while doing A-&gt;B from a spot with poor connectivity etc.


Nodes can't relay an infinite amount of transactions per second, and blocks can't fit in an unlimited amount of transaction per block.  After a transaction is included in a block its not completely settled, as another blockchain could form leading to an orphan chain, but that is above the level of this post and if you are interested you should research further.  
Other community members, my learning is a work in progress too, so please point out or clarify my post, need to go now, thanks!!

I have already but since you're too dense I'll summarize again for you.
You are correct that Bitcoins are only on the blockchain and exist as such whether they are grouped together or broken into tiny parts they will always be signed to an address on the blockchain.  However the problem with mt gox was that they sold Bitcoin credits that were supposedly redeemable for Bitcoins.  This allowed them to sell more Bitcoins then they actually had and/or to keep selling coins after losing many in a hack.  
If they had truly been as you were saying "blockchain transparent" (constantly showing a proof of reserves), then they wouldnt have been able to pull off such a scam.  that's why your "but blockchain transparent / mt gox" argument fails.  Mt Gox was able to pull off a scam/massive fraud and tank the market because mt gox and its customers did things against the spirit of bitcoin.  They relied on trusting a third party, as opposed to the decentralized, trustless (ie provable) system that bitcoin is.  
I don't care about DHS spending money on Starbucks, at all ever.  Yes it is trivially interesting that if they operated on a bitcoin budget with known addresses and starbucks also had known addresses we could watch in real time the appropriation of government money but there are other less disruptive ways of doing this and I'm sure there are many problems with doing that with the Department of Homeland security.  So I agree with you on your point that this post is useless.  I just don't agree with your rationale that mt gox fraud was "blockchain transparent".  If it had been then we wouldn't have had this problem.  So yes blockchain transparent is good and important in the case of "trusting" 3rd party entities with your coins, but I personally do not like the idea of exposing massive amounts of peoples' transactions.  Being subject to scrutiny on purchasing seems contrary to the nature of bitcoin and is one of the major reasons I would never work for the gov't

actually a debit card + bitcoin + cash back would just about solve 98% of the day to day hassle of using bitcoin.  and if the mass doesnt know they are using bitcoin, but they are using bitcoin the OP who is a hodler or want to be hodler would make money because of the increased demand for bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:57:30
I agree with you except for the "unreasonably" upset qualifier.  Losing money because one party of a two party deal cancels it because it turns out to be a bad deal for them is a good reason to be upset.  and again, there can be separate checks in the algo, so this doesn't prove anything.

A much better way to do it would be to delay the intial broadcast for a set amount of time and allowing the user to cancel it then.  I wonder if any wallets have this feature.  A more cool way would be having it be a 2 of 3 and having the second sig only be released after 30 seconds, and the other other sig being a cancel send back one. =D

I'm very happy for you that you have a job.  here's a question, and I'm trying to learn not be tricky.
if you started at bitcoin = 100 and it goes to 400 you are up 400%.  If it then falls to 300 you are only up 300%.  Therefore it has fallen (to you) by 100%.
Of course I see it breaks down that you always adjust so that you take the high as the quotient and the low as the divisor but that seems awfully subjective.  If you're constantly resetting your vantage point, wouldn't percent change be completely meaningless. ala its not 100-&gt;200 = 100% its 100-&gt;101-&gt;102-&gt;103...1990&gt;200
@_date: 2014-11-01 04:55:15

Those aren't fees in the literal sense of the word, they are actually a mark up that coinbase / or another seller is charging you.  If the customer, vendor and vendors supplier all used bitcoin, there would only be fees due to the protocol, and these fees you talk about would be one time entry fees.  
Also don't forget the "fee"-less case where the vendor or consumer obtains bitcoins as a result of a purchase, gift, etc.

@_date: 2014-11-23 00:15:40
he's wrong.  the IP that relays the transaction is just the node that blockchain.info heard about the transaction from.  bitcoin is like bittorrent and passes tx's between nodes until it reaches a miner to get included in a block.  that ip address is in NO WAY linked to the transaction.  there is talk that you could theoretically perform a probability mapping of IP addresses to triangulate the person who originated the tx but that's a theoretical attack now.

believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment.
No, I dont believe its "entitled"  I had to look it up because I thought maybe you were using some weird alternate definition of the word entitled.  OP stated that he didn't want to invest any more of his time (read: waste) on dealing with support because that kind of treatment is what got him turned off of banks and interested in bitcoin.  I had a support case going on with coinbase for over 6 months and it was never resolved they seem to have just written off my account and relationship with them.
"it takes two seconds"  yeah right dealing with any company's support is often a nightmare that takes multiple hours of explaining over and over again to multiple people.  Maybe coinbase is special and magical, but  I can totally understand the OP's reluctance to go down that road when he had another option available to him.

I was in favor of the increase, but I recently swayed to against it after reading recent posts, and now I'm again confused by which way I want it to go.  It seems bitcoin needs more technical innovation then just changing a hardcoded number.  Both arguments seem to be losing to decentralization, its either a question of who gets to be a node (if blocks are huge, large resources are required) vs who gets to be included in transactions (if blocks are small, higher fees will be needed to get in the block)

to clarify with a concrete example... the people that tipped you with ChangeTip... those are just website credits right now.  until you "withdraw bitcoins" from changetip (and they are forced to exchange your website credits for real bitcoins) they own your bitcoins.  If they or any other online bitcoin wallet disappeared, you would have ABSOLUTELY no recourse, even if its was 100,000$ worth of money.  You will want to get a wallet that only you have the private keys to and send the coins to an address in there.

information doesn't really move at the speed of light.. a connection to a server is about 50 ms and peer to peer networking requires on many such connections, it can take a substantial amount of time to reach a miner or majority of nodes.

its number of blocks... it calculates how many blocks have been found and how long its been and then uses that amount to change the difficulty.. ie if too many blocks have been found in the set time period raise the difficulty.  if the average block time is greater than 10 minutes, lower it.
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:36:40
I don't think people understand this but its absolutely true.  and it reeks of a scam when you can't even claim the 2 cents because of the mining fee.  Sure us bitcoin people know that the 2 cents mining fee goes to supporting the network but a normal lay person would think there's some asshole CEO of Bitcoin pocketing it all.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:37:39
you are missing something. the difficulty doesn't choke down the supply or limit the number of correct solutions, it just makes it harder to find the solution that matches.
one more time, the algorithm that determines difficulty is completely separate than the algorithm that is used to determine the block reward.

Be careful when you're dealing with bitcoin that you get ACTUAL bitcoins, and not just website credits.  Some of the explanations in this thread are a little bit off and I can tell that you are at the point in your bitcoin journey where you are curious, but you need to be careful not to make a mistake.
basically bitcoins exist as a value assigned to a public key.  A bitcoin address is a shortened version or hash of this public key.  When someone sends you bitcoin, they transfer ownership over bitcoins that were formally assigned to their public key by signing a transaction with the private key that corresponds to the public key.  The transaction just says, take 2 bitcoins that were assigned to my public key and assign them to another public key.  This is picked up by miners and included in the next block.  The blockchain is a record of all of these transactions, which taken to the present shows ownership of bitcoin.  You only really own bitcoin if its in an address that only you own the private keys to.  So if its on a website and not on a wallet you control, its really just a website credit.  Feel free to respond to me with further questions, I've been around these scene for years now and I realize the explanation I gave might have been muddy but its very important you understand these things.

except its wrong and can make deeper understanding confusing.   I'm all for simplifying things to make them easier to understand but adding in false information that has to be relearned later is counter productive.  Thats why I hated taking chemistry, FFS just tell me how the electrons really orbit not some Bohr model bullshit.  here just do this instead please. 


@_date: 2015-01-11 17:51:20
no thats not true at all. you're confused on quite a few points I dont know where to start. bitcoins aren't created by finding a new unique solution to the same problem, each problem is different-- the miners are looking for a hash of the last block. the difficulty is the number of leading 0's the hash must have. coins are limited because there is something coded that states every 4 years worth of blocks reduce the block reward by dividing by 2. It has nothing to do with the mining algorithm or the difficulty algorithm.
I hope this cleared things up I'm trying to be helpful so if you have any questions please ask me. And if I made any mistakes I hope someone will correct me.

yes thats correct. you could go ahead and do it right now in your own bitcoin core client.  the problem is, no one would listen to you and all your blocks would be deemed worthless.  The amount of coins produced is set by the consensus of the network which right now, is choosing to honor satoshi's ordinal design.

the jump to 20 mb to me seems very motivated by big corporate interests... a much more sensible approach is called for, like 2 or even 4 mbs, but that plus the scaling to HUUUGE blocks just shows that g.anderson has been bought off by big corporate interests that want to use the blockchain as THEIR store of distributed data and make it too expensive for anyone else to be their own bank.

@_date: 2015-07-06 17:06:39
i also think what you're saying is categorically untrue... yes, blocksize is the maximum amount of space that can be allocated for a block, which determines how many transcations you can fit in it.  You can't fit more transactions in a smaller block, thats just wrong.  a transaction is an input and an output, but added more inputs and outputs to the same transaction leads to still the same amount of space being used (if not slightly less, NOT more)

I don't think annual value == market cap... if you exchange the same 1 billion dollars worth of money once per week, thats 52 billion exchanged with 1 billion in market cap...

฿ is better because it looks like $ but is the same letter that Bitcoin starts with.  We associate $ with money, so its easy to extend that to ฿.  So please stop this silliness now that other B is ugly.

be careful using logic and inference around here, there's a ton of big block shills pumping this HUGE block thing.  Its quite alarming the huge jump they are pushing and it makes you wonder about their motives-- just what are they planning to do with the big blocks once they have them??

almost true but there is block propagation time to factor in-- a miner can't mind a new block until they have processed the last block... the larger a block is, the longer it will take to propagate and therefore the more of an advantage the last miner will have.
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:15:01
what about when the block reward is zero?  and blocks are huge so there's no fee market?  what incentive is there to mine then?

yes thats one reason the patent is public but the main reason is : in exchange with sharing how the invention works with all of humanity they are assured a time period where they have sole use of the device.  Patents expire and then the good is free to use by all.  this is in contrast to trade secrets where designs are intentionally obfuscated so they can't be copied, however, if they are, they are unprotected legally.

depends.. if the attacker has access to the server, you're screwed. if there is enough bitcoins in the non 2FA accounts to deplete bitfinix of their fractional reserve and you have money in a 2FA account with them, you are liable to get goxxed. and if your 2FA password is the same as the password to the exchange, you're also screwed...

if he's that rich he wouldnt be doing any of these things himself, his people would be.  so it would just take however long it takes him to notify his people, and for them to track down an expert.  I would be willing to bet a truly wealthy person could do this within a couple hours, without disturbing the price at all.
plus, neither the ransomer or the ransomee would care about disrupting the price.
