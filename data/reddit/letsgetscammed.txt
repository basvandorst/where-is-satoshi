Isn't it equivalent.

by soft forking you don't throw nodes of the network that won't upgrade, but you still need 95% miner/pow consensus.

Disappointing episode.  
I hope Chris gets over his crush on fluffy puny soon.  The double standards be applies on junseth v fluffy pony is ridiculous.  
He admittedly was working on monero while waiting for it to hit exchanges to dump his coins.  
He admits on buying alts to dump them on pumps.

Oh great you came to fix bitcoin AND it's easy! 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:54:41
Scrape that previous remark, that's too easy.   
There are good reasons to scale slowly and good reasons against a hard fork.  
If you're just in bitcoin to have it pump quickly it might not be for you.  
If you think the fundamentals are solid, you can lay back and let it scale at a pace that won't kill it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:58:17
But.. But.. Isn't it a... Scam? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:43:18
Great thanks
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:12:53
So in that case he has to wait till the price crashes before he can buy again? Wait it out so to speak.

You are giving value to the network. You not gaining additional security for yourself since you not veryfying your own transactions.  
Luke messed up not clarifiyng that
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:51:27
AFAIK bitcoin doesn't use longest chain, but chain with the most work done. Slight difference.
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:33:36
You should use dogecoin, it's even cheaper. Or better pay coin.  
  
PS. How much did you lose on the exchange rate, and the spread? 
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:41:41
junseth might pretty well be chris' man in bitcoin. we'll see.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:47:13
By your logic, lite coin and doge coin would be skyrocketing. They have 4 - 10 times the space.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:06:12
You are saying that more free space in the blocks would drive the price up.  
That's hard to believe.  
Especially since a main reason for bigger blocks is to get the price for transactions down.  
So what is it, cheaper transactions, more expensive transactions or what? 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:31:46
Vitalik is meaningless for bitcoin

Who was the guy that created an exchange where you could trade gox coins for real bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:12:52
Market timing doesn't work.  
You can't predict dips and lows.  
  
If the price rises this week, and next week, too. When do you buy? What when it rises 3 weeks in a row. What if the dip in week 4 is still twice as high as the high in week one? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:35:29
1.  
Possibility one. Two alive chains.  
Possibility two. One alive and one dead chain.  
Possibility three. Two dead chains, total clusterfuck.  
Dead chain= not enough mining to further the chain.  
  
2.  
Where / how do coins exist?  
Your coins exist through a transactions on the block chain.  
If the block that contains your transaction is part of both chains, then yes, you own your coins on both chains.  
Is it possible, that your coins won't be part of both chains?   
If you happen to make a transactions on the height it forks it might happen, that your transacting only is included on one chain. For older blocks it should be impossible, that your coins aren't on both chains.  
Only extreme case would be if every miner on one fork would blacklist your coins, is impossible.  
  
3.  
Worst case is that BU destroys bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:53:57
Since there is no cost to creating an identity, you can create an unlimited number of them. And fake consensus etc.
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:58:14
There is no way to determine that the private key is included until you remove the sticker.  
This is not usable as physical bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-16 07:25:39
He can spend it, it's his.  
  
If he was able to get access to the private key, others are too. By moving the coins he is securing it.
  
Your allegory sucks.  
If you find money laying on the ground do you pick it up and try to find the owner, or do you leave it there, because it's not yours? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:19:57
It's not about everyone getting what they want.   
2 MB and Segwit would (more than? ) quadruple the block size, which is considered too dangerous at this time by the developers.

Looks like I dodged a bullet there
@_date: 2016-12-12 20:48:24
The only acceptable reason to mine an empty block is that you haven't fully validated the last one and don't know which transactions you can include safely without breaking consensus 
@_date: 2016-11-29 19:05:06
That's so 2014.

There was a post from a guy being charged for money laundering, or transmitting our sth similar, for doing exactly what you are doing.

@_date: 2016-10-15 04:55:42
You don't own pre or post fork coins. You own a private key to an address.  
If the blockchain has unspent outputs on that address you will be able to spend them, no matter what.  
Forking is (in regards to your balances) nothing more than making a copy of the blockchain (your balance) and having separate rules for the way new blocks are created for each copy.  
Forks normally don't change the past (unless you are a useless shitcoin).
@_date: 2017-05-06 06:47:54

You broadcast the block which has all the transactions in it.  
If it has transactions that were unknown to your node, they might be from the miner himself.

By definition they aren't ponzis. You might call them scams or bad business ideas, which fits for all (at least almost all) of them.  
  
Edit: you might say, that ethereum is an (accidental ) ponzi, since the new users that enter the eco system, have to go through eth. Basically the new money is cashing out the early money AND the money/eth is used for something that has no basis (ICO).
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:21:57
The question means that you don't understand how bitcoin transactions work.  
You don't pay a fee for the amount of money you spend, you pay a fee for the amount of space you use on the blockchain.
