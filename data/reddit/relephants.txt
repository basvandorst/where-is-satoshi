I guess you don't remember. There was so much congestion on the eth block chain from Crypto kitties that it was running at 100% capacity. Eth doesn't scale (yet).
I don't know how you don't remember this

Making bitcoin private at its base level will be nearly impossible

1000s of generations? Humans havent been alive for 1000s of generations.
If children want to provide care for their parents I have no problem. I will be helping my parents as much as I can. Housework, trash, grocery shopping etc. I will give them my time no problem.
The issue is when the elderly parents have to financially rely on their children because of their mistakes. That isn't right and isn't how it's been done for "1000s of generations"
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:46:25
Oh I agree lol. I don't want bigger blocks.
But it gets you banned
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:06:38
And it's wrong. Children are not supposed to be financially responsible for their elderly parents. Social security isn't supposed to be your only retirement income. While you worked for those 40 years, you are supposed to be contributing to an ira, 401ks etc. If you need to rely on your children for your future finances, you didn't do enough during your working life... Thats a fact
Take a trip to personal finance sub.
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:42:23
That's a little misleading. In that 4% are exchange wallets and coinjoins.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:31:37
This is completely incorrect lol. The mere mention  of bigger blocks in a positive light gets you banned. I love bitcoin but this sub is very, very censored.

The difficulty of the mining increases and deceased of blocks are found too fast or too slow.   This keeps the block time to just about exactly ten minutes over a period of months. The halvening is pre scheduled based on when a certain block is mined so we know when it will happen. 
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:17:20
Questionable as in still in beta. Which is fine, for now. You can still lose funds on lightning. I meant  questionable as not ready for real world adoption. Who knows when it ever will be.
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:28:58
Agreed. But now we are stuck with a secure coin which is great, but is expensive and slow when volume shoots through the roof
I dont know the near term solution. Not Schilling any coins

@_date: 2019-03-22 14:02:45
Yes but that doesn't change the fact the 21 mil can only be sit equally. It's the same number no matter how far you break it down 
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:06:38
Split sorry on mobile
21 million divided by 7 trillion people will be the same number regardless of bitcoin was 8 digits or 350.
@_date: 2019-11-17 02:17:47
Another fantastic answer full of substance.
Why because we will get censored ?
@_date: 2019-11-17 05:03:00
In short no. 
If price of btc goes down, people who mine at a loss will stop mining because their costs are too high. This will decrease difficulty for the remaining miners. 
Lowest electricity wins out.
@_date: 2019-11-17 02:18:46
Very, very incorrect. There is no company or central authority that runs monero. 
Devs are community funded.
I suggeet you do some more research.
@_date: 2019-11-04 21:32:20
Post this in the tax sub. You'll get some answers from cpas
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:45:54
The supply of Bitcoin never decreases. Ever. There will be new bitcoins every block. The supply is always increasing until 21 mil. Just the rate at which they are produced is halved.
So no dumbass. If demand stays exactly the same  as today, btc will never be more than today's price.

We are a long, long way away from that. We aren't even sure if lightning will work or be adopted.
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:25:27
See my below comment. 
It works for the people who are familiar with it. My parents wont use lightning in it's current form  
I use it no problem but I'm very tech savvy
We are years away from full time adoption and that's if everything goes great
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:50:02
You literally are.
If you aren't how did you come to the conclusion in your last sentence?
@_date: 2019-11-18 03:55:26
We need lightning faster than ever 
These people can't afford Bitcoin fees every transaction.
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:20:01
Lightning is still in beta. We have no idea if it will even work
We are years away from even thinking about lightning adoption
@_date: 2019-11-04 21:15:16
You're confused. That 38k included regular income as well. Do you have a job that makes over that amount ?
@_date: 2019-11-17 01:55:01
No you haven't. 
You're referencing an outdated study done before the implementation of ring ct. 
Stop fudding monero when you know nothing about it.
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:23:33
Works great if you know what you're doing. I've used it. 
99% of the world will be unable to use lightning in its current form. It needs a better and easier interface, which takes time. Years at least.
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:12:33

It's either LN or BCH
@_date: 2019-11-24 00:59:06
Because Bitcoin is not private.
@_date: 2019-11-17 01:53:45
Monero is FINRA compliant. 
All crypto can be banned. This doesn't mean much. 
So kindly fuck off
@_date: 2019-11-17 01:55:53
How is monero more centralized? 
Can you provide examples/evidence instead of random claims 
@_date: 2019-11-17 03:54:24
Neither does monero.
Both co exist quite nicely
@_date: 2019-03-23 23:37:41
Because no one needs to answer your question. It's been answered for two years. Google the reasons why and learn them yourself.
You obviously support BCH, which is totally fine and I personally don't care. If you were truly looking for answers, you would have found them by now. 
@_date: 2019-11-04 21:31:03
Does that include your Bitcoin sale?

@_date: 2019-11-17 17:03:42
This is correct.

This is a really good answer.
@_date: 2019-11-17 03:44:32
Please feel free to hop over to the monero sub where you can ask your questions and hopefully get a better understanding of monero. Also feel free to discuss pros and cons of other coins compared to monero. You are free to do that there. You won't be banned
@_date: 2019-11-17 02:17:30
Great answer. Idiot.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:58:15
Most casual bitcoiners want to be able to actually use the damn thing without paying large fees. 
Once upon a time Bitcoin was all about banking the unbanked. 
Now all I see is price memes. 
Adoption has stalled. Lightning is questionable at best. 
Just what in the fuck man.

Yea  I'm aware. 
Doesnt change what I've said
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:59:44
Correct. But you can try to flip heads twice thousands of times per day to try and get it. Here it takes 30 years for only a 26 percent chance. Far from impossible but I wouldn't call it a decent chance 
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:59:31
I'm thinking that custodial lightning channels will exist where the custodian will pay the on chain fee for you.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:12:49

So the moon is tethered?
Oh the irony
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:50:36
Bitcoin doesn't bank the unbanked. Sometime over the years that changed. You can't bank the unbanked when the fee is someone's monthly wage.
Hopefully lightning changes this.
edit: Being downvoted for telling the truth. Bitcoin is not currently for banking the unbanked. Don't agree? Tell me why instead of downvoting. Most of my portfolio is Bitcoin, I am not an altcoin shill
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:32:43
Didn't Satoshi say that it should be a medium if exchange lol? Is store of value even mentioned in the white paper
@_date: 2018-06-27 23:03:21
26 percent chance of that happening in the nest 30 years if truly 1 percent. Not really a decent chance. 
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:30:01
It's a taxable event
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:11:07
Being a collectible doesn't mean a store of value. I read the links especially the last one, I see no mention of a store of value
I am on mobile tho. Bt is a pain on mobile
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:46:08
It's supposed to be a peer to peer medium of exchange. Not a savings account. Read the white paper
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:33:26
Why do we preach to hold? Aren't we supposed to actually use it?
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:01:21
Unfortunately if this cycle repeated it would be done to 0. To recover from a 10% drop it would need to go up by 11% to get back where it was. Suffers a 50% drop? Need 100% gains to recover 
@_date: 2019-10-14 21:54:00
Yeah I got ya. Just thinking about adoption. I'm tech savvy. I run my own nodes for multiple cryptos and I'm a miner. When I read comments about having to be online every two weeks or using watchtowers (a third party to make sure someone doesn't do anything malicious), I can see the majority of people just getting frustrated and giving up on cryptos.
@_date: 2019-10-15 15:49:52
But I don't think we can get mass adoption if we don't use it.
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:49:00
What ?
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:13:00
I did. I see nothing that was updated. Please provide proof
That update with October's date was there 6 years ago
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:23:46
No. This is not a taxable event and is not reportable. HOwever it is unclear if this would require you to check YES for the question. Typical IRS

You said that post got updated but it didn't...
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:27:49
Yeah I guess so. That's annoying. Shouldn't be there business if it isn't taxable

Monero for privacy for one. 
I wouldn't consider monero a shitcoin at all.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:09:06
Bitcoin was invented to be peer to peer electronic cash for EVERYONE.
Right now it isn't that and can't be until Lightning is actually ready for everyone (which I am hoping is within 2-3 years).
So for right now, we are stuck with speculation since it can't be used as its intended use case.
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:58:30
And why not?
@_date: 2019-12-11 12:53:07
Collaboration requires communication
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:09:17
It also restricts adoption  
Imagine being a peer to peer currency but being told that holding it is better than spending it.
Screw that
@_date: 2019-12-13 12:52:22
Dont stack. Spend.

@_date: 2019-12-03 03:18:06
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:12:34
Stacking and holding does nothing. Bitcoin was meant to be spent
@_date: 2019-04-29 11:49:53
If this is the way lightning is going I'm all for it. Just hope it works
@_date: 2019-04-29 02:58:40
That's not a good thing...
For someone who makes $5 USD per month, how will they even be able to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-29 11:39:55
Don't you still need an on chain transaction to use lightning?
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:49:47

The market decides what to buy and not what to buy. If sv is a scam, it will eventually die. If bch is a scam it will eventually die. We aren't centralized.  Calling for action against certain Cryptos is a dangerous slope to go down.

Up to 70 now. I don't understand posts like this
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:14:30
I didn't. My company did. I have an S Corp in the construction field. My father started the business in the 80s. I took over when he retired.
A normal person can't get a loan for that unless it's a mortgage or if they have the income or collateral. These are business loans. Some of them required collateral.
You start small and grow slowly. But sometimes you need that extra push from a loan.
As for personal, work hard, be respectful, show up early, leave late.
 I'm the first one there and the last one to leave. Apply that to your life.
I should add. It's not all roses. I actually got sucked into taking over cause dad got sick and retired. I hate the job. The stress is unreal sometimes. I won't be here forever. Just navigating what I want in life but doing this for now. And by for now it's been 7 years since taking over and 12 working with the company. Oof
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:29:40
Yeah. That's the bonus of owning a business. Can be high reward if successful. But the stress is like none other. My workers are my family and they depend on me and I depend on them.
Owning a business isn't for everyone. It's wasn't for me but I adapted.
Keep plugging away boss. Your moment will happen. You'll look back and say shit, all that crap I went through was worth it to get here.

Really bad answer. Business owner here that has taken lines of credit to help with expansion and new equipment. We were/are in great financial shape.
Also have taken a line of credit for payroll. We bill net 30. However many of our customers (power plants) are net 90. 90 days is a long time to go without getting paid 300k.
Also for new equipment. My crane went down 10 years ago. Needed 100k. Borrowed it. Rented the crane out for 1000 a day. Paid the loan back and now have a free and clear crane that I make money off of

There is nothing to report if you are buying and holding. You only report when you sell (capital gains or loss).
I bought like 8k in crypto last year. I have never sold anything. Nothing to report on my tax return, except my mining operation, which I did. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:26:26
You can never time the market. And if you do it isn't because you're smart. Its because you were lucky. So why bother?

@_date: 2018-04-03 17:57:01
There are definitely a number of successful traders. But that doesn't mean they timed the market correctly, or they didn't get lucky. You will always hear about their successful trades but rarely ever about their bad trades. In November and December of 2017 I made 60k in 3 days. At that time you could literally throw a dart on a cryptocurrency and you would make money. Does that really mean I was great at timing the market? Nope, I just got lucky that I jumped in at the correct time. If you every have a spare day or 2, I highly suggest Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Investor." Its a fantastic read. Obviously the cryptoworld is a lot more volatile than stocks, but the same principles apply.

Air travel is not meant to fly the unflyable. Bitcoin is supposed to bank the unbankable, not cater to only 1/2 the world who can afford transaction fees.
