That is an unreasonable response.
You cannot do that when you are in business. You cannot do that when other businesses you deal with get hacked. If your email becomes well known you cannot just dump it and I have a lot of email addresses for different aspects of what I do.

I do use random email addresses. That is only useful in some circumstances. I have domains I control that must have working standard email addresses such as abuse, postmaster etc.
Some of those addresses date back to '96
How many people do you think have the luxury of rolling their own email address!
I am not so stupid as to be caught by these idiot bitcoin scammers. My intent was to prevent them from catching other people who don't have the level of experience you and I have.

Oh and by the way I never said there was an issue with bitcoin, they are your words. I was just wondering out loud about the possibility.

The only saving grace I think is most victims wouldn't have a clue about bitcoin and how to go about depositing it in a random string of text.
So it must have a very low success rate.

Yeah that's not going to happen. There isn't a website the email addresses are spoofed and routed through botted servers.
If you can track them down the best way to break their software is with a bullet. These guys aren't sophisticated or even necessarily intelligent, probably snot nosed 14 year old's. but botnet's and bitcoin make their task piss easy.
Its not like they can ask for someone to deposit money into their bank account without getting caught but bitcoin on the other hand that's a different story.

If an address is effectively a random string. Then perhaps it can't be used to block a scammers actions. My probably incorrect assumption was the wallet address could be used to stop a transaction such as "if this coin came from this address, cease the transaction"
It seems such a shame that there isn't a way to stop these criminals in their tracks rendering their actions wasted.

I am not overly interested. but I have been online for a long time hence my email addresses are well known. therefore I get a number of "we turned your webcam on and filmed you" scams, I don't even have a webcam. Unfortunately many people are not technically savvy and my guess is a lot of people pay up.
If there was a way to make those payments fail it would be good.  
I am also aware of the pitfalls of such an approach but its a case of the benefits outweigh the concerns.

You have never been in business have you.

Hmmm 
I looked up fungibility in relation to bitcoin. Interesting. I had never considered it. 
But no I wanted to make the coin valueless to the perpetrator only. but as has been explained its almost an impossible task.

you get it in a closed system as well. In a closed system bringing them to justice is more likely. 
Oh well it was just a thought.
