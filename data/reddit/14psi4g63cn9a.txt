Nothing really. If you've ever bought anything with bitcoin though it really is a strange feeling. Pull out your phone scan QR code and you're done. No change, no cards in a slot and pin. It's just satisfying. Better than CC or cash? Probably just cleaner and more efficient but I'm not sure it's actually better.

I think your confusion is that you've never seen a key and are mistaking a Bitcoin address with a key. Try setting up a paper wallet and you will understand a bit more...maybe. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:27:37
Virtual machines are so easy to corrupt though. That's scarier than holding your wallet on a stick.

What's the game plan after that? Trick people into using your copy? You could make a million copies but how would you make people care? Nothing is stopping you from trying. Just a waste of effort.

Of the entire virtualmachine or just the wallet?

I have used it for mining before. I'm curious how that would work then. What would allow them to just debit me?
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:58:01
The higher the value, the more profitable it is to mine, the more real-world resources will be spent on mining.
 The more resources spent on mining(raising the network hash rate and with it, the difficulty) lowers that profitability. 
It's not the value that's driving up the resources spent. It's the competition to secure  a greater percentage of the hash rate. The value can stagnate and miners will start powering down their rigs. Even then, these non charity miners can take advantage of the lower hash rate to profit by keep hashing or adding more hash power.
A fall in value wouldn't affect the hashrate just like a rise in value doesn't. Imagine the value plummets and all asics shut down. In this scenario even GPU miners can profit and waste a ton of energy. It's self-regulating and the value does nothing because miners are competing with other miners not the value of Bitcoin.

That's pretty funny, did you end up getting rid of everything without too big a hit?
@_date: 2014-09-23 05:00:25
His friends converted by buying BTC from him so I doubt he charged them a fee. The magicalness comes from pulling out your phone and scanning a QR code to pay. It doesn't sound like much but the first time you do it is definitely more magical than putting a card in a slot and pushing a pin number. 
Online it's even more magically as there's no long number expirey date and cvc code to input and the stupid securecode thing I can never remember. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:14:40
Yea. Everything was fine. Last night I used my friends filthy computer to do a lot of my Bitcoining though and this happens. That may have been a big mistake.

Bitcoin is more international than m-pesa. cash-&gt;m-pesa-&gt;cash is local.
International cash&gt;bitcoin&gt;m-pesa or cash would be the goal I think.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:02:58
The advantages are negligible because more can't be afforded. This is the best we can do for now and if that's not good enough for you, you're just not an early adopter. It's a start, it's growth, it is not spontaneous generation. Why rock the boat? If that's your outlook then feel free to watch from the sidelines.

Yea they would lose their value but that has nothing to do with some entity upholding a promise. Wouldn't that case be similar to Bitcoin itself dropping to 0?

When you don't care about something, you can hear an entire news story about it and not even register it in your memory. The majority of people I know still never heard of it.

True but what would happen if your money was stolen that way? Any idea what banks would do? What can a hacker really do transfer the money to an anonymous account? Genuine question.

I read that as gets sentenced life in prison. My jaw dropped.
@_date: 2014-01-26 08:31:49
This doesn't work. The information is not identical. You can tell by how much more dense the QR code is for the private key than your public key which is longer.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:48:13
I think the real objection is that it's an absurd argument to even try to make. That is just not how WU is used in any sizeable manner while this does occur daily in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:45:06
I have a laptop running linux I bring with me usually. The one day I don't. I do hope it's some sort of fee from something. It doesn't make sense that you can just charge a wallet though. 
Changing my passwords anyways.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:49:27
I wonder how often this happens. BTC theft seem to happen fairly frequently. It'll be interesting to see how that problem is tackled.

I think the honouring is done by the code. It's as much someone honrouing 1BTC=450USD or whatever it's at as it is the coloured coins.

Where do you go?  I don't go looking for places to spend Bitcoin but I see BTC accepted signs many place in toronto, throughout Australia, random places in Thailand and Malaysia. Paid bar tab with ETH in Malaysia. It's not wide adoption but I swear I see the cryto accepted here sign way more often than I'd expect.

By that logic, neither has btc
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:47:56
He's not saying that at all. Saying 98% are in the green is insane. It's a hypothetical scenario that is unrealistic but it's used just to prove a point. Only applies to buying and holding until this point. Which is nowhere near to reality.
@_date: 2019-12-25 14:31:00
fair enough but I was laughinng at the downward pressure part.
@_date: 2019-12-24 09:15:46
haha downward pressure. How much btc are you gifting anyways? That's like giving some kid a nickel and worrying there would be any candy left in the shops.
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:25:02
Yes! When someone suggests new methods and technologies to be employed to secure new technologies, the only solution is to backpedal to an old idea.

Holy shit macros. Lol. Isn't a macro just a type of meme though?
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:30:51
Yes you could. It would have all the same properties of Bitcoin, which gives it it's value. You would lack the hash power which is needed to give it the security required.
So no you couldn't easily create a valuable crypto of your own. You have the tools and the knowledge available to do it in the same way I have the tools and knowledge to make a triple Platinum rock album.

If that happens I almost wish I lost all my coins on gox. Would have prevented me from day trading and I'd be up way more.
@_date: 2018-03-13 07:07:14
Why are you so angry?
Tons of people are getting scammed and losing money in crypto. Most of those people can't even tell you what the thing they're buying does. Even if the technology attracts tons of scum profiting off schemes a technology is simply that, tech. 
Bitcoin is not some stock of a company that promises to do anything more than to be an unforgeable object on the internet. Whether the price collapsed to $1 or goes up to $10000 the only thing Bitcoin promises is that one Bitcoin you have is authentic. 
There's also tons of people being scammed using the internet. I'm not dismissing the tech.
You seem to think Bitcoin is just a promise online but it's only promise is that each Bitcoin is the most genuine thing that exists and no hacker on the planet can change that.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:05:00
Jesuswalkered guy is right. You don't even know what you just bought. If you don't even know what Bitcoin is then the other guy was right. Either forget about it for a year or two or research the tech not the price.
If you don't understand the product when it comes time to make a decision you'll be lost and panic.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:46:02

How society works is the easiest solution. Coinbase was the easy solution. 
Actually keeping the world how it is is the easiest solution. You can choose to maintain the status quo, but it's the easiest way, not the only.
 Federal reserve and Fiat is the way society works, why even bother knowing what bitcoin is if you can't see past what we know works now? Bitcoin was a long shot to start with.  If you can't entertain the notion of discovering a new method besides the one we know works, then why waste your time here?

The difference with a tech company that doesn't produce anything is that a Bitcoin will still exist as a token that is unchangeable and unforgeable. Bitcoin is the tech. It still has useful, unique properties even if you think it's worthless.
 
Yes, many people are buying in hopes someone else will but it for higher later. Yes, that is a Ponzi scheme. But if or when the price stops rising, the properties if the coin don't just disappear. You can still send Bitcoin across the internet to anyone. You can still trust the security and integrity of the ledger. Everything that makes a Bitcoin a Bitcoin will remain.
This highly speculative era is unavoidable in order to have naturally growth. To work on a world wide scale the price has to be much higher than it is now. Unfortunately, you can't just state one btc is worth $1000000. Speculation has to drive it to that point.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:48:34
I'm sure they'll be better ways employed to safeguard your life savings rather than a piece of paper if crypto gets to that point of popularity.

Probably more than 10 years. In that time there has been no distro that can take on Mac or windows in general household computing. I use my Linux box for specific reasons only.
I suppose you think Xbox rules, Nintendo sucks. Canon is like a billion times better than Nikon and every other useless childish argument.
I wish Linux was a better all rounder. It would save me the extra hardware.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:32:49
That's weird. My first Bitcoin purchase was made around 5 years ago with massdrop.
@_date: 2018-03-13 07:55:59
So you envision a future where systems will be run off of blockchain tech and not one of them will be a form of currency or store of value?
At the moment blockchain and every implementation of it is really shit and useless. As shit as bitcoin is at being a currency, it's been the only real use case so far that even works in a remotely useful manner.

I've used Ubuntu since gutsy gibbon, mint , and other Linux variants for many years and it is just not a good replacement for Windows.

Mint on Thinkpad x300 is a beaut to use but it's so easy to see why it doesn't work as a mainstream system. It's not just about being too stupid as these Linux diehards like to think.

It doesn't hold value from the labour if what was created is useless. But the properties obtained with the creation of Bitcoin are desirable and valuable. Your invention can be a dud technologically but I'm this case, it's sounds tech.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:28:00
It's more like the legitimacy of Bitcoin in the eyes of government is acknowledged. Gives Bitcoin freedom to grow. Whereas now, people are still confused if Bitcoin is useless and evil.

I think my feelings for trx partly explains the reactions. 
To me trx looks like a scam, through and through. People make ridiculous amounts of money from it but it'll come crashing down eventually. It's frustrating to see this while others are getting dragged into this. Some will come out rich, while most others will lose a lot.
It makes me really angry thinking of the people who will profit from cheating others. Anti Bitcoin sentiment stems from this same belief I think.

My German friend used it when he find out about crypto. They're just cfds, no actual crypto is exchanging hands.
When the market spikes they actual disable buys or sells.
My friend told me it's greyed out when he wanted to sell. I was thoroughly confused. 
"What do you mean greyed out?"
"I can buy, but right now the sell button is greyed out."
