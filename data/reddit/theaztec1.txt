Is this like snapcard

Maybe there's those surveys or offers that can be done. Also there's the ad click things. But none of those are worth it in my opinion. It's better to just buy it or mine an alt coin and convert it.

Good picture bro. Would be cool if you could tell me what's next ahead of time though.

If times get desperate you can always sell your body for some coin. Good Luck!

Okay, you how would cash out hundreds of thousands. You can't just go on coin base or bitstamp and just sell. You gotta find someone that'll buy  everything and it would be at a big discount. And the movement of such a large amount of coins would be seen. Can someone elaborate more on this

Return 99.99% of them :-P

Yah I'll send you a bit coin for $900
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:44:15
Yay!

Isn't bitcoin builder allowing people within gox to "sell" coins since trading between accounts is still possible, so they send it to builder? So in way buying can also occur from within? Anyone know what I'm talking about cuz I'm not sure exactly. Please correct me

How irresponsible do you have to be to lose the key to such a large amount of money. Could this really be it? Such a big exchange and this happens....

Good, thanks for the heads up!

Old man that's stuck in old times and stubborn to new things. People like this hold us back from moving forward and advancing.
