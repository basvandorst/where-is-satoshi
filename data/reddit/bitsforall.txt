Its funny to vision everyone tapping their feet, anxiously staring at the computer screen, itching to hit the buy trigger.  I know i'm ready to go all in at a moments notice.  
The next run is going to be a monster!  Be ready

Part of the reason we entered this current bear market was Ben and his Bitlicense.  I think the implications are that it will be the official end of the bear market and a great start to 2015.

Simple - the Bear Market ends when new buyers out weigh daily selling pressure. 
IMO Bitlicense is the most promising near term news that will bring new buyers.  
As you mention - all this positive news and we go down.  Once the trend reverses, there will be a huge correction to the upside to properly reflect past good news.

Way to many bullshitters in the Bitcoin space, wish we could purge these people.

Its happening;
Like it or not, SaruTobi is the most viral Bitcoin Application right now.  
Developer Christian Moss has done something no one else has yet to do.  He has inverted Bitcoin so it now pays its network.
How can you even have an app on itunes or Android without paying your users?  How can facebook and every other social network exist without paying its users?  Seriously, Christian Moss just changed the game.
We no longer need Wall Street to usher in the next Bitcoin run.  Get your kids, your wife and anyone else to play SaruTobi.

I don't use my Bitcoin for shady shit and I don't jerk off in the shower to fatty porn.
Therefore, I have no problem with Coinbase being a leader in following the rules and I have no problem with drones flying around making sure everyone is safe.  
As for you, get some blinds.  
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:21:26
I Invest in Bitcoin on a weekly basis.  No part of my investment decision has to do with Coinbase.
As for whether or not they manipulated the market with their false claims through the WSJ and website...I think this firm has a strong case.  
What they did was unprofessional and reminiscent of the games played with penny stocks.    
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:42:32
Yes.  Global Central bank crash is imminent.  They are all preparing for Bitcoin as plan B.
Be ready!  It has already started and will only accelerate.

Lol what, yeah that example is really close.

This is a huge shout out for Bitcoin!
Only working with 30+ companies and one of them just happens to be Coinbase.  Thanks Google!

I agree that it will be very soon.  The avalanche just needs a trigger event.
I think that trigger event will be positive regulations from Ben Lawsky.  Regulations that wake up Wall Street.
On Friday, January 9th Ben Lawsky said he will release the regulations within days;
Listen from 3:30-3:45;
And on December 17th Ben Lawsky says we will see Wall Street rush in once regulated;

Like children they play
I wanna feel at home
I want to feel at home
You know i cant stay
I wanna feel at home
I want to feel at home
Nah at night
And in the day light
Come on broken boys
Lets stay tight
So when the morning comes
And were all dead
We can live free
Just like my brother said
He said
"don't stay, go out and play, you cant live until your dead."
But you know the freedom that my brother saw
It deep down
It in your heart
Nah the children play like my brother say
And i wanna feel at home
And it's the beautiful sight at the break of day light
That makes me feel like ill find a home
So to the girls and boys calling out wolf noise
One day you'll find a home
And if the world unites
Sets the mounatin alight
Then outside your house will become your home

Their false claims caused a 50% pump and dump.  They should be accountable.  
You would never see a professional company set-up a page showing a rocket going to the moon.  They single handedly caused a 50% rise and fall in Bitcoin off misinformation.
@_date: 2015-01-28 05:07:28
I don't trade Bitcoin.  I only buy.  Was using Coinbase for buying but now i'll try another company.
The whole lunar page and countdown was a joke and very unprofessional.

Yes.  Its very important the market leader is strict and follows every regulation.   We need a solid foundation that leads the way for the average person.
Want to use your Bitcoin for shady shit, simple, go elsewhere.

Not sure I understand why Etherum and Counterparty count as 1.  Both should have their own spot.  And is Etherum truly a "Bitcoin" startup?
Nice to see Swarm near the top!  I think they're one to watch.

The voice of the empire, the scene is on fire
Pull the plugs higher, I spit fire
Trance of the empire strangle my desire
Pull the plugs higher, and I'll spit fire
I'm BORDERLINE happy, and I'm BORDERLINE sad
I'm BORDERLINE good and I'm BORDERLINE bad
And I can't get rid of this singing fear
You saw me out and my head gets clear
I live my life in shackles, but I'm borderline free
I used to be blind and I still can't see
In a round and round till you change your mind
As long as nobody breaks my sight
Shakes of the empire, make me happy can't say I'm higher
Higher they're away higher, fools of the empire
I went to school in the empire
Like the rules from a bradsire
I be a fool of the empire
Till I break loose, breath fire
Burn it down!
I'm BORDERLINE happy, and I'm BORDERLINE sad
I'm BORDERLINE good and I'm BORDERLINE bad
And I can't get rid of this singing fear
You saw me out and my head gets clear
I live my life in shackles, but I'm borderline free
I used to be blind and I still can't see
In a round and round till you change your mind
As long as nobody breaks my sight

One does not quit Bitcoin.
Having an exit plan with Bitcoin is like saying -
I'm going to use Facebook for two years, then after two years, once per month, i'll delete one thing from my feed until its empty.

Its classic Facebook.  These two are great at finding the next big thing but horrible at executing.
Although, I do think their ETF will be first to market and do very well.

According to Zuckerberg the amount of data we share is connected to Mooers Law;
"Zuckerberg explained that in accordance with Facebook’s data, social sharing functions exponentially, so that the amount of stuff you shared today is double the amount of stuff you shared a year ago and the stuff that you will share a year from now will be double the amount you’ve shared today. In Mark Zuckerberg’s Law of Social Sharing, Y = C *2^X — Where X is time, Y is what you will be sharing and C is a constant."
I believe there are already companies working on providing humans with a Blockchain ID opposed to a Passport/DL.  
With all value transfers recorded, the reward could be a world with drastically less theft.

Ben Lawsky should be put in prison for colluding with banks, hedge funds and governments to control the price of Bitcoin.

Good quote from Eric about the amount of change coming;
Eric Schmidt spoke at the Techonomy conference in Lake Tahoe today and dropped some serious rhetorical bombs. "There was 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003," Schmidt said, "but that much information is now created every 2 days, and the pace is increasing...People aren't ready for the technology revolution that's going to happen to them."

Swarm is far from a scam.  Swarm and Counterparty will be two of the largest companies in the Bitcoin space within two years.
