Where did you buy beer with BTC in Amsterdam? I'm interested

That won't do me any good. The payment was for dinner take-out. If the merchant gets it, well I will have no use for a second dinner in the middle of the night :D

Can confirm. Had dinner there a few times :) Never used the ATM though

Interesting piece of data.
Hopefully they will all not be burnt to a crisp and abandon BTC.
I'll just wait and see. Thanks for your input!

Does anybody have advice on how to **properly** investigate the legalities of operating one of these machines? I would be interested in setting one up (this very model) in my city in the Netherlands, but I feel overwhelmed by the conflicting, unreliable information I come across.
How would you go about this?

Sorry! I'll be clearer. Search the Web for a tool that does base64 encoding of stuff. Upload your image and you will get a long and complicated string of characters. This is the encoding you need. It's a text representation of the data that is your image. Next open up the wallet generator website and reach the step where you can see the background. Your browser has a dom inspection tool, it could be called inspect page, Web developer's tools, something like that. It's CTRL SHIFT I on Chrome, maybe more. You the tool to inspect the page and over time you will get to the fragment of html where the background is loaded. And it will be a base64 encoding :) Edit the img element/node and replace their encoding with yours. KEEP THE BEGINNING of the string, only replace the actual encoding and not the headers. Good luck! You can then just download the whole software to run locally and change it for good in the source if you want do this often.

That is a really clever development and I'm very happy such thing exists.
That said, the security implications of this thing are enormous.
THAT said, developing infrastructure AROUND BTC is guaranteed to drive adoption (or at least make it possible). Crazy speculation does the exact opposite (except for the very short term).

The background is merely a "data" source, you can swap it with your own by editing the DOM (easy with Chrome, Firefox, Opera) and replacing its source with a base64 encoding of your image. It's really 30 seconds of work. HTH
