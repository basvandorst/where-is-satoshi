I use CoinJar.io

There's the standard identification process.
I just uploaded a scan of my passport and a .pdf of a telstra bill.
Takes about a day or two to be confirmed.
Then you add money to your account. Hit the button, say how much you're sending them, they give you bank details and a code to put in the description. Money hits your Coinjar as quickly you'd expect it to hit someone's bank account. Instant if you're with NAB, a business day or two for other banks.
Then using the money in your account, you place a buy order. 
They use a combo of MtGox and BitStamp markets to try get the best prices.
There is no option to add custom buy or sell orders like on MtGox though. But if you're a long term investor, it's a nice way to go.
Same sort of process for selling. Just hit sell when you're ready. Cash hits your account. 
To withdraw you have to link a bank account. It involves them sending you a cent with a code in the description. Enter the code on the website and you're set to make withdrawals.
Oh, also, they have limited sell amounts or something every 24 hours. So, when there's a crash in the price and everyone panic sells, you've gotta hope you're selling before the rest of the users on CoinJar. Same thing happened on CoinBase when the price dropped from 900 to 585 earlier today.
Anyway. That's my experience so far.

I don't blame them, especially after the surge of people trying to jump on the bandwagon. 
I got in early and the whole process from sign up to BTC buying was a day or two.
Now I've got multiple friends I've suggested CoinJar to kicking themselves they didn't do it sooner.

Is BTBTC worth the money?
Or should it only really be used if you're planning on making a fair amount of trades?

I use Coinjar. Userfriendly. Simple. If you're with NAB, transferring money too and from your account is quick.
