Does the FTC even conduct raids? I thought they did all their work with court cases and the like.

Yes. I confirm you are a writer for CCN.

nah thats [doge-talk](

Ambulance chasing? No. Not in this case. BFL has consistently and repeatedly lied and perpetuated fraud. 
All they had to do was show up in court and at the very least there wouldn't have been a default judgement against them. If they had even a sliver of a chance of winning the suit they would've been there I promise you.

Yeah I get that you were pissed because a bank wanted to charge you to cash a check drawn from their bank. But as the only bank in town I guess they can do whatever they want in a free market.
As a small recompense ~~know~~ ^I ^know ^you ^already ^know ^this keep in mind that this same free market is what is driving the growth of BTC.
Just yesterday I was trying to use a AMEX rebate card that expired that day. It was supposed to have $18 but the balance showed a $2 ~~fee~~ charge. So the the card where "the funds dont expire" and "charges no fees" will do a service charge of $2 a month after 7 months. Sneaky.

~~1/10 Soooo... Trying to give Bitcoin credibility by adding "Gives Blowjobs" ???? Is this a convention or a frat boy party?~~

I wouldn't say OP is naive or gullible; he was conned. Some very smart people in this world have been conned before. Its usually the ones that think everyone else is stupid that gets conned the worst.
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:02:33
lol no.. I knew it was a joke just thought the bit about the blowjobs was out of place at a convention with national coverage.. See Ive read how BFL employees talk on the forums and they, in my opinion, have set a new low in unprofessionalism ^(^is ^that ^a ^word?). They will never get a dime from me for anything.

Maybe. But when I sort by last transaction date the latest date is May. But yeah.. maybe *deep* cold storage.

yes, yes, I see it now... Consume less = use less electricity and save money.... eat less and get in shape...  drive less and save on auto repairs....

DD funds can't be transmitted unless the funds are there to transfer. With a paper check here the bank is saying they want to wait for it to clear in case it bounces. Thing is, in this day, paper checks are transmitted electronically to the issuing bank within **24 hours**, so the **week hold is total BS**
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:16:59
ahh ok.. that makes sense.. Thx

Despite the street cred these guys have, you would think they would have stayed away from preorders.... Nothing good can come out of it (preordering) IMO. Best of luck to them in any case.

You know, it occurs to me that people like must be supreme cowards to say something like this within the anonymity of the net because they know if they said this in RL they'd get their ass handed to them. Anyhoo, best of luck OP. Hope you get some recovery.

Yeah I hear you get +4 vs hackers this way
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:07:26
From me? No. But the more widespread (in ownership) the coins are means quicker acceptance.

Please keep us posted on what happens... Have you found anything out from Paypal yet?

Just for fun  go to Control Panel &gt; Java &gt;  View...  (Under Temporary Internet Files) right click the app if its there and choose Show JNLP file. C&amp;P the info shown to pastebin.com or something and give us the link. Probably a good idea to mark the paste on pastebin.com as Unlisted as well. Then give us the link to that paste.

Exactly. I also am starting to question the use of the word "Decentralized" with BTC as less than [1000 people own over 50% of BTC]( Now I grant that is much better than, say, USD [where 1-2% own 90%]( but still.
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:12:34
They need to work on that color scheme. I couldn't make it past the front page without my brain doing a hard reboot.

Since when did DHS give a damn what any other agency says or does *OR* what the Constitution and Bill of Rights says?
**Edit:** Just had a knock on my door. I have been informed that the DHS *does* care what other agencies and the Constitution says.

Also I would go to java.com and verify you have the latest version.

All of this is happening because when BFL dropped a press release 2 years before the product *might* ship people were telling them to *Shaddup and take my money*. You wanna sell a product? Then sell the damn product. "Preorder" is nothing but illegal and unregulated capital funding for the scam artists. And when the scammers see how bitcoiners are willing to [wire 50 grand over a few emails.]( well... can you blame em?

Kinda funny to see Apple do the EXACT SAME THING to themselves withe the iPhone as they did with Mac back in the day. What are they down to now? 11%-12% of the phone market? Difference is now they don't have Jobs to pull their bacon out of the fire.

It is disappointment to me to see that 100 addresses have 20% of all bitcoins. So much for wealth distribution.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:06:51
Simply saying that the more people that have coins is a reflection on the growing acceptance of coins as a viable currency.
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:05:16
Actually if their parts are around $100 +/- then they aren't overcharging. Not unusual to see hardware marked up 50% - 75% on devices like this. 
Just sayin.
