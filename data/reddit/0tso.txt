A few years back it was pretty normal that supermarkets would charge you 3/5 SEK for transactions under 50SEK. It's since been outlawed to place that cost on to your customers (meaning that it now comes out of the owners pocket instead) and now very few places charge you for paying with your card.
When more businesses go cash free it means that there will be more business owners demanding that their banks stop charging them for transactions. So I really don't see the problem? This is a very positive trend! At the very least, more business owners seeing the benefits of not handling cash, will lead to them making better deals with their banks!
In Sweden "Convenience fees" are unheard of. Maybe that is why you are so sceptic to this? When I moved abroad I thought it was a mistake when my bank charged me for paying with my card. At least I wasn't being charged for receiving texts/calls like in some other countries...

Lund is a small student town and this area is named Djingis Khan after a very successfull "studentspex" (silly theatre shows put up by students) written by one of Swedens most prominent comedians back in the fifties.

The "inventor" touched this in the swedish article but sweden.se didn't translate it..
He argues that the size of the reserve will be automatically adjusted since if there is too much honey it will be so cheap that you would eat it rather than using it to pay for something.
The honey needs to be in a 700g (thats probably 1.2-ish pounds) jar and have a sticker from Sveriges Biodlares Riksförbunds (Swedish Beekepers Association)
