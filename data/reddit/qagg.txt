I lost you at learning fluent French in two weeks. There I call bullshit.

Per day, per year, it’s the same as long as you assume that within a fixed time frame it will come back. The problem is that when it goes down by 100 you cannot assume it will go back up by 100 in any time frame. Maybe it does in a day, maybe it takes a month, maybe a century.
Brownian motion is like being at the park with a toddler: he walks around randomly and you have to follow him. Sometimes he goes left sometimes right, but that doesn’t mean you can just sit on a bench and wait for him to come back.

All things being equal, inflation incentivizes you to buy slightly more wine now, deflation to buy slightly less wine now.

Inflation tax is not arbitrary, it’s proportional to how much cash you have.

The point is that, in the aggregate, over many people there WILL be an effect. Will a retailer stock up on wine today or tomorrow, knowing that holding btc buys more wine tomorrow?
Would you borrow btc to buy land and grow grapes, knowing that the price of land will drop relative to btc? And so on...

This would work if fluctuations were guaranteed to have zero mean in the long run. But this is not the case.
Imagine that you knew that price oscillates within a band around 7k+-1k, over a year’s time. Then you could always buy when it is under 7k and resell above 7k. You would be sure that price comes back up within the year because of the assumption above. 
This would be sure money for a speculator. There being no such thing as a free lunch, there must be some mistake in the hypothesis.
Google “efficient market hypothesis”. Incidentally this is also the reason why (most?) technical analysis is bullshit.

Games using non fungible tokens for in-game items have a hard time being carried in the app store. Speculation that Apple somehow has a difficult relationship with crypto.

Not as long as people don’t withdraw from coinbase to personal wallets. If they manage to keep transactions off chain (coinbase user to coinbase user) they won’t need to fully cover their deposits with real bitcoin.
Still, what’s the fraction of coinbase held bitcoin wrt the total amount of bitcoin in circulation?

It’s their fault for not complying

Hundreds OR thousands... not OP though

Do you need wine? No. Should all the wineries close shop? Cosmetics? Smartphones? Do you realize that spending only for what you need is the definition of poverty?

Since there is all sorts of shit as data embedded in the blockchain it’s probably safe to assume there is some satanic shit as well. So...

Thank you for pointing this out. Another clarification: hash rate does not impact the price *directly*. There is still a correlation, though.

We all knew the crash would come. I personally was surprised it didn’t happen at 10k. After the 10k psychological threshold was passed, the problem was to know when it would crash for good. There was no way to know that. It happened at 20k. Could have been 50k instead.
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:20:18
People are solving hashes (mining) faster. There are more miners online. The network is more secure. No impact on price.

It combines ignorance of economics and the way society works in general with us VS them mentality. The more you read up about the history of technology the more cringey it sounds

Look there is lots of bullshit in those fields, but it’s not *all* bullshit.
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:36:01
Well don’t put them on equal footing. Not even medicine is on equal footing with physics. You still need to use whatever imperfect theoretical understanding we have to cure people. Same with economics.

It would be wise of them to do it anyway. No power can ignore the internet battlefield. Surely the US, EU (and single EU countries), China, etc... all have their “troll” armies
