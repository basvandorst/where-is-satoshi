Hey can someone help me. I know we don't talk about many altcoins here, but I have a friend who recently found out I own Bitcoin and when the price shot up most recently I mentioned it rising. 
He said "oh I'm so excited!" But then checked his Ethereum. We started talking and he said he thought Ethereum was one of the better alts due to the tech. 
Can anyone explain why people feel this way about Ethereum? He wasn't taking me very seriously when I said I believed in Bitcoin and just Bitcoin lol and Ethereum didn't count :P

There was an incredible video here posted maybe a week ago comparing BTC to the transition from the horse and buggy to the car as well as snail mail to email. I can't find it now but if anyone knows it please link. 
Basically it comes down to the technology and anti-inflation of that.

That's what I told her. I did at one point say "do you know what it means/how it affects it's future price? It's not immediate." 
She hasn't sold yet as far as I am aware.

Made a new wallet with Legacy and it STILL is saying it doesn't register the wallet address when I go to withdraw BTC. Annoying.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:17:39
Lots of people telling me to sell now and I'm just sitting there going "nope. Not today." 
I believe with most of my heart it'll go up up up over time.

She does own both, but she's more into Litecoin because of some "financial advisor" she trusted had told her to invest in it. I told her, and try to educate her as much as I can about the importance of researching it on her own and deciding what she thinks will stick technology wise. 
It's not a big investment for her anyway. She mostly wanted the excited of telling my father that she made some money on the side. She does listen, but it's funny she does ask me "what she should do" for the past few years I've been saying I only believe in Bitcoin and I don't know much about other coins.

Lol at my mother calling me yesterday. The conversation went as follows: 
Mom: That thing happened with my Litecoin but I didn't make jack shit. 
Me: The Halving? 
Mom: Yeah that. Why didn't it make the price go up? 
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:47:37
Okay so, fun story. Made a new wallet with legacy and still running into the same issue. ARRRGGGHHH

I'm a dollar cost averager too....so it'll just keep growing overtime.
@_date: 2019-06-14 18:58:59
The time travel in it makes NO sense at all.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:57:09
Both. Oh, just tried to transfer a small amount into my NiceHash wallet to then transfer to my segwit wallet and it worked with that address. Sooooooo very strange. 
So I guess I'll just transfer to Nice Hash to then transfer once more to my Electrum wallet.

I know Trezor is good and I've helped people set it up before. Maybe this is the switch I will need to make and this is the reason. It 100% works with the CashApp withdrawals? 
Been avoiding spending more money on something just to store the stuff haha

This is incredible.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:52:01
The new one I made with legacy starts with a 3. 
The original one (segwit) started with a bc1.

Is this Loss?
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:33:52
Interesting. Can I change my address in my wallet? Or do I need to create a new one? Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:02:21
I'm not a very large holder but it's growing! :)

Is that book actually good? I've been wanting to read it but I've been hesitant.
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:11:43
Nevermind! You now have to click on the charts at the bottom and go to Bitcoin and click "buy"
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:12:27
Oh Jesus. I use this to purchase DCA and transfer at a certain amount to my hardware wallet. Calm down, big boy.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:35:54
He probably thought he was cool and smart and savy saying that for sure.

Wasn't a candy bar like $0.05 back in the day? Why spend 0.05 when it'll be worth 2.00 in the future?
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:44:54
I wanna know this too. I also invest weekly (sometimes bi-weekly) and using things like Coinbase can really make buying bitcoin annoying with the fee on top of it.
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:16:36
Don't forget that horrendous mythical   e t f
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:06:40
Yes but what do you use to buy them that doesn't have too intense of fees?
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:05:06
But don't many places accept Bitcoin (like major retailers online)? I know here in NYC there's a bunch. So... Speak for yourself?
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:05:35
There was a bar down the street from my in Brooklyn that had one of these about two years ago. They were just installing it and I was curious about it. 
About three weeks later it was gone.

When I bought something on Newegg I used Bitcoin, since it went up, I had more to spend and therefore got a better piece of equipment. This was about....six months to a year ago?
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:10:56
Do I? It was more currency and I had it in the moment. And nope, just holding for now.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:37:51
Except it's fear of missing out.
