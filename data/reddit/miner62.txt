Thanks for clearing that up.

Maybe you're right, but I doubt it. I'd bet they just have a high fee for dealing with Paypal because of charge backs. They have to rake in tons of money per transaction to cover the loses when there's a charge back.

There is no way (that I know of) that Circle will allow them to buy 2 BTC overnight. They have a $300 buy limit for months, then move you to a $3,000 if they feel like it.
I don't think Coinbase will work for this guy either. He doesn't want to give up any personal account info. Coinbase isn't going to like that. None of the on-line exchanges will.
If you (taway0789) can only use a credit card, I don't see how you're going to get 2 BTC overnight from any exchange. Credit card charges can be reversed, so they're not going to want to give you that much BTC on a CC charge.
The only option I know of would be to use localbitcoins dot com. You'd have to meet a local bitcoiner at a nearby coffee shop or somewhere, hand over cash, and he'll send you the bitcoin. But, now you're not using a credit card... You'll need cash.

I'm not so sure. Some areas in the US have electricity for 9 cents a kilowatt. If your electricity is this cheap, and you don't mind the noise and heat coming from an Antminer S9, You could mine at a profit for the next few years. Enough to cover your costs for 1 S9  miner, power supplies, and electricity, plus a little more for you pocket.
These things are LOUD!!!!

"Free electricity... Included in my rent."
You might want to check your rental agreement. Your electricity is probably FREE under normal conditions.
Where I live, the electricity starts of at 19 cents per kilowatt and goes up from there when you use more. At these prices, 2 S3's will add about $90 to $120 to the monthly bill (depending on the price tier you end up in). Your landlord (who pays the electric bill) is NOT going to like that. He's going to want to put a stop to your mining operation right away.
If you mine anyway because there is nothing in the agreement that says you can't, then the landlord will probably evict you as soon as your lease is up.
Get an old USB miner or two, and control them with a Raspberry Pi. This will burn 10 to 20 watts, adding 2 to $4 to the electric bill, and you're landlord will never notice. Of course you'll be mining practically nothing, but you'll have cool blinking lights and everyone who comes over and sees it will say "Hey, what's that?" Great conversational piece.

Yes, there are lots of services like this. The Circle App is one of them. It has a weekly buying limit. But when I buy my limit, it's 8 days before I can buy again.
Since it's listed as weekly... I'd think that if I buy my limit on Sunday, then next Sunday I can buy my limit again. BUT NO! I can't buy again until Monday. And then I can't buy again until the following Tuesday! And so on.
I don't know... I wouldn't call this weekly. I'd call this every 8 days.

Sorry to hear about you losing coins with Mt Gox. I don't believe they got hacked. I think it was an inside job. The owner is one shady character.
Yes, hardware wallets are the way to go when storing the bulk of your bitcoin. But when you're tying to sell on an exchange, you have to send them your bitcoin you want to sell. That amount of bitcoin has to be there, ready to go when your price is met.
What percentage of stolen coins were waiting to be sold, and what percentage were sitting in hot or cold wallets, I don't know.
But there needs to be a better, more secure way for these exchanges to store bitcoins.

I don't think so. I mean, I'm sure that happened, but it wasn't the norm. Most of the time they formed a posse and went after the robber. Whether the caught him or not, the next logical step would be to make the bank more secure. Keep the majority of the money in a larger safe, and/or post a guard.

Now that I think about it... You can probably do better with an S3. They burn about 380 watts and default settings, but are WAY more efficient than the S1. The S3 can be underclocked also. You should be able to underclock it so it burns ~200 watts just like the S1, but the S3 will mine about twice as much BTC  watts than the S1  watts.
It will be hard for you to use 2 S3's without your landlord noticing a major increase in the electric bill. (even with them both underclocked)
You will need a watt meter to know how many watts you're burning. Change the underclock setting on your miner, let if run for ~10 minutes, then check the watt meter. Go to Amazon dot com and search P3 P4400 for great watt meter.

"Fiat currency: Legal tender whose value is backed by the government that issued it."
I don't know where you live luck_13, but here in the USA the "value" of fiat currency (USD) is NOT backed by the government. Bank deposit amounts are insured through FDIC, but the value is back by NOTHING. It used to be back by gold, but that stopped around 1972.

All what trouble? This is NOT trouble, it's just part of doing business.
If you're a business accepting some sort of funds (which all businesses do) you're going to have issues that must be addressed.
If you accept credit cards: There is a small transaction fee PLUS a percentage fee. And then if the card is stolen or the card holder isn't happy with your product or service, there could be charge backs.
If you accept cash: There is more counterfeit cash out there than you think. Some of it you refuse to take, some you accept thinking it's real. Your teenager employees either just don't care, or get lazy and forget to check the bills carefully. Counterfeit bills WILL make it into your cash register. My friend who works at a bank sees counterfeit bills come in through large merchant cash deposits all the time.
If you accept bitcoin: There's going to be issues that need to be worked out and minimized here too. But to have the policy "If there are zero confirmations in 15 minutes, your bitcoins go bye-bye." is ridiculous.
Sure... The business could stop taking bitcoin to avoid these issues, but then should they stop taking credit cards to avoid the all the fees and charge backs? Should they stop taking cash to avoid accepting counterfeit bills?..... No!
If you stopped accepting forms of payment because there are issues with that payment, you wouldn't have a business. The smart thing to do is to have reasonable policies to deal with each form of payment.
Just accept the bitcoin transfer with zero confirmations as "paid in full." It's not likely that anyone will go through all the trouble to do a double-spend just to get a pizza. If the pizza place owner had this policy, I'm sure he would lose more money in counterfeit cash than bitcoin double-spends. Until everyone is truthful and honest, this will just be a part of Business As Usual.

Widespread adoption hasn't happened, yet.
The first credit card came out in 1950. But didn't really start to get popular until the early 1970's. Bitcoin has only been around for 7 and a half years. Give it 5 or 10 more years and see where it's at.

I don't like the title of this thread. "Microsoft Bitcoin Nightmare", it implies that "Bitcoin" is the cause of the "Nightmare". I read ALL of your complaint and I see NO issue with bitcoin. I see an issue with Microsoft's policy around bitcoin. I see an issue with "Microsoft Currency" (not being able to be refunded). But I see no issue with bitcoin.
The title should have been....
Microsoft's Nightmare Policy Around Bitcoin
Microsoft Currency Nightmare
It seems to me that bitcoin had NOTHING to do with the "nightmare" aspect of what happen... Other than you used bitcoin to buy Microsoft Currency.
Sure... To a "bitcoiner" a refund is easy. Simply get an address from the customer and send the funds to that address. But the people at Microsoft are not "bitcoiner". They are just some support staff sitting in front of a computer screen with several options in a menu that they can perform. If refunding the bitcoin isn't one of the options, they CAN'T do it. If refunding the Microsoft Currency isn't one of the options, they CAN'T do it.
This all boils down to BAD Microsoft policy, and bitcoin had nothing to do with what went wrong (like the title implies). Not everyone will take the time to read the complaint like I did.

Yes barnz3000. I do realize the amount is alarming, and it's right to ask "how did they do it?", but don't panic. Hold the bulk of your own bitcoin in cold storage (paper wallets or hardware wallets) leaving only a small amount on your computer or phone to spend or trade. Just like cash. Keep the bulk in a bank and rest in your wallet.

Banking in Africa is not like banking in Europe, America, or other advanced parts of the world. It's very antiquated. With not many banks around, not many merchants can accept credit cards.
In the say way Africa skipped over "land line" phones and went straight to cellphones, they could skip over banks and credit card and go straight into bitcoin.

Coinbase has lots of issues like this one, I know - I've been through a few of them, but I feel Coinbase is one of the most trusted exchanges out there.
When I send tech support an email, I get a canned response right away. Another response 2 or 3 days later saying "Sorry for the delay. If you're still having the issue respond to this email." Then 2 or 3 days after that I get a real response from a tech that actually helps.
But with all the complaints I see about Coinbase's support and AML/KYC policies, I've NEVER seen anyone complain that Coinbase has lost their funds.
Like others... I totally recommend storing your bitcoin on a hardware wallet of your own, with your seed words (backup) stored in a fireproof safe or safe deposit box at a bank. (Hey!!! Banks are good for something!!!)
Use Coinbase to buy or sell bitcoins at current market value, and if you're buying, as soon as they come in TRANSFER them to your hardware wallet.
If you're selling bitcoins on Coinbase's trading platform, you HAVE to have the bitcoins sitting there, waiting for the price you want. No way to avoid that except to sell them at current market value. But the bulk of your bitcoins should be in your own hardware wallet. I wouldn't even trust Coinbase's Multisig Cold Storage Wallets.
When storing large amounts of bitcoin you should think to yourself... "If you want something done right, do it yourself."

I don't know about after 18 months... This hard to calculate when you don't know what's going to happen. You would need to know the difficulty and bitcoin price in 18 months, and no one knows that.
According to coinwarz dot com, an S9 and 9 cents per kilowatt electricity, you would currently (with current price and difficulty) make an extra $6.17 mining bitcoin per day after paying for the electricity. That's ~$185 a month profit.
Now of course this amount will go up and down with the difficulty and price going up and down, but there's an OK chance you could be profitable until the next halving (a little less than 4 years).
Yes, it's a gamble. I do NOT recommend doing it. It's too hard to compete with the huge mining farms getting their electricity for 4 cents a kilowatt signing special contracts with the electric companies.
I tell everyone who's thinking about mining to take that money and just buy bitcoins. I'm just saying, it's POSSIBLE that you could make money mining IF you can get electricity for 9 cents a kilowatt and you don't mind the noise and heat from an S9.

True Illusion, very true. I think this is the best answer to my question so far.
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:20:20
What did I say that was wrong? It sure is easy for you to just say I'm wrong, but not tell me where I'm wrong and/or correct me.
I'd have to say "Your right!" Merchants are NOT falling over themselves to accept bitcoin. But why???.... Is it because bitcoin sucks?... No!
I've already pointed out how accepting bitcoin is better for the merchant than accepting cash or credit cards. So why is it so hard to find a merchant that accepts bitcoin???
I think it's because bitcoin is still relatively new. I've been studying bitcoin for over 3 years, and I still don't understand some of the details. Merchants (people in general) shy away from things they don't understand. If they get how it works, they don't want to work with it. So until more merchants learn about how bitcoin works, and understand all the advantages to accepting bitcoin, they will simply not accept it.
But the fact that not many merchants are accepting bitcoin, doesn't mean it's not the best method of payment. They just aren't using it because they don't understand it. 
The first credit card came out in 1950. Did all or most merchants start accepting credit cards right away???.... Hell NO!!!! It took decades before credit cards were widely used.
Back in the 1970's, when credit card were just beginning to be used more, merchants started charging the customer MORE for using a credit card, to cover the extra credit card fees the merchant has to pay. The banks didn't like that, so they lobbied to get laws passed to outlaw charging more for using a credit card. Then the merchants said, ok... "Use cash and get a discount!" Hahahaha.... Basically the same thing, but they found a loop-whole. Slowly but surely that went away too. But it took well over 2 decades (maybe almost 3 decades) for credit cards become commonplace.
So lets not complain too much that bitcoin isn't widely accepted after only 7 and a half years.

The difficulty isn't all that high compared to the total network mining power. Blocks are averaging just under 10 minutes, with the last 6 blocks taking 59 minutes.
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:20:46
Sorry.... To stay in that 10 to 20 watts range, you're going to be mining in the 3 to 6 Gh/s range. (extremely small amount of BTC)
As far as USB miners, check out...
Block Erupter
You can get a Block Erupter Cube. They have on-board control, so a Raspberry Pi is not needed. You use your computer to access it and set it up with your internet browser. Once it's set up, you can turn your computer off, and the Block Erupter Cube will just keep mining and mining.
A Block Erupter Cube will give you 30 to 32 Gh/s, but will burn ~200 watts!!!! That's going to add ~$35 to the electric bill. Your landlord might notice that.
Search for Block Erupter Cube on eBay. I'm sure you'll find at least one for sale.
Search the names I gave you for the USB miners on eBay too. Those might be harder to find.
You might be able to do better with an Antminer S1. They mine at 180 Gh/s and burn 360 watts (at default settings). But they can be OVER or UNDER clocked. If you underclock it to it's lowest setting, I'm not sure what the numbers will be. My best guess is you might get ~90 Gh/x @ ~180 watts. (if my guess is right, you're MUCH better off with 90 Gh/s @ 180 watts, than 30 Gh/s  watts) If my guess is off, I'M SURE you can get the S1 down to around 200 watts while mining MUCH FASTER than 30 Gh/s. The S1 is much more efficient than the Block Erupter Cube.
But remember... This is ALL FOR FUN. But with FREE electricity, you might not do too bad. (If your landlord doesn't notice the electric bill increase and make you stop mining or evict you.)
With the current price of BTC and the current mining difficulty, and FREE electricity, you can make ~$2.11 for every 100 Gh/s per month.
BUT.... The difficulty (most of the time) goes up every two weeks. If the price of BTC stays about the same, then that $2.11 a month will go down.
But if the price of BTC go up a little, that $2.11 could stay about the same, or even go up the the price of BTC goes up a lot.
Search for Antminer S1 on eBay.

Africa doesn't need to mine bitcoin to be a part of the bitcoin community. Smartphones are getting more and more popular in Africa, and to carry a week's (or month's) worth of wages around in a bitcoin smartphone is very safe. Much safer than carrying cash because a bitcoin wallet can be backed up and recovered if lost or stolen.
The main problem I see is the speed at which bitcoin is becoming a part of their economy. Merchants must start accepting bitcoin as payment before it would make sense to carry around bitcoin in a smartphone wallet. And merchants won't start accepting bitcoin until lots of people have bitcoins on their smartphones.... So you see... It's kind of a catch-22 situation.
I see all of this happening. I just think it's going to take a little longer for it to happen than most bitcoiners would like.
Bitcoin is a completely new technology. It takes time for completely new technologies to take hold and become common place.
I bought my first home computer in 1982. Family and friends couldn't understand why ANYONE would EVER want a home computer. Two decades later, there's a computer is just about every home (in the U.S.).
The first cell phone came out in 1973 by Motorola. But the hand unit you put to your head was HUGE or tethered to battery pack you'd have to carry like a small briefcase. Then they started making car phones, which solved the battery problem because it ran off of the car's battery. But it wasn't very mobile being tethered to a car. About 3 decades later the cellphone starts mass adoption (in the U.S.).
But sometimes a new technology can make an old technology obsolete before it even has a chance to take hold. Example: There are more people in Africa with cellphones right now, then there ever was with "land line" phones. Running the land lines was just too much for Africa. Putting up cell towers every so many miles is MUCH easier. And with the towers already in place, the switch from dumb phones to smartphones should be easy. The problem with smartphones in Africa is that they use a lot more power. So electricity and the higher cost of the smartphone are the two main factors for not making the switch. But as solar panels become more  popular there, the switch to a smartphone will have one less obstacle.
Bitcoin is only 7 and a half years old. Two and a half more years and it'll be just 1 decade. At one decade it will still be a very new technology sorting out a lot of issues. I think mass adoption will start to happen around 1.5 to 2 decades from it's beginning on Jan 3rd, 2009.
The best thing an average person could do right now would be to buy and hold as much bitcoin as you feel comfortable buying.
Buying and holding bitcoin right now would be like buying stock in cell phone technology in the '80's, or buying stock in computer technology in the '90's.... Just a few years before the technology explodes!!!

I guess. But if you're trying to get rich on bitcoin, you shouldn't be selling your bitcoin. Not at this point. At least not all you own. You should hold most of it, and play with 10 or 15% trying to catch the highs and lows.
I'm thinking this 19% drop in the price had to be because of people selling most or all that they own. That's crazy if you're trying to get rich on bitcoin.
I don't know... People will do what people do.
I made the most of this 19% discount. Once it hit $575 I started buying all I could get my hands on. I kept buying all the way to it's lowest point (~$531) then back up to $575. I figured anything under $575 was a total bargain. I'm still going to keep buying, just not as much. I'll probably keep buying until it reaches ~$10,000. Then I'll think about selling... A little at a time.

"There are 5,000 bank robberies in the US every year. I'm not going to use a bank."
"There are cars stolen every day. I'm not going to own a car."
"Houses are broken into every day, I'm not going to live in a house."
"An exchange has been hacked, I'm leaving bitcoin altogether."
You try and fix the problem. Not give up.
Banks now have FDIC insurance, bulletproof glass, and guards.
Cars and houses have locks and alarms.
Bitcoin needs SOMETHING to keep these large holdings safe.
There has to be a way that's better than just giving up. Bitcoin is an awesome idea and technology. Some new idea can fix this. There are great minds working on improving bitcoin every day.

Maybe this hard fork will happen. But I think there is a better answer out there somewhere. There has to be a more secure way for these exchanges to hold bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-08-21 03:04:10
Yes... I was over simplifying.
But I REALLY like your idea of some sort of special addresses to hold large amounts that can be reversed (funds returned) after an unauthorized transfer.
This would be great for exchanges and whales. It wouldn't even make sense for a hacker to even try and steal them if they can be simply rolled back in if stolen.

Yes... Thank you pesa_Africa.
And anytime they are going to hold or transfer a significant amount of funds, they're going to want to do that on the MOST secure blockchain, bitcoin.
But the payment network m-pesa has built in Africa is quite impressive. I wish bitcoin had organization skills like that. Maybe bitcoin should have a reward system more like DashCoin. The miners get 70% of the mining reward. The nodes get 20%. And 10% goes into a fund to pay developers and promotional projects.

I like the Ledger Nano. It's about a third the cost of a Trezor, but it doesn't have a screen. So it has to display your Wallet Words on your computer's screen. This "could" be a security breach if your computer has a Screen Logger Virus (or if you're using Windows 10, which watches everything you do and sends it back to Mircosoft).
But, not to fear. There is a way around this. Ledger has an ISO you can download and write to a USB flash drive. You can boot your computer from this USB drive, which will be a clean boot with NO viruses, and Microsoft won't be watching. You'll only get a simple menu to setup your Ledger Nano, and shut your computer down. Then remove the USB drive and boot your computer as normal.
This might sound complicated, but once you do it, it's really not that bad.
Ledger has another solution now. A month or so ago they came out with the Ledger Nano S. This one has a screen on it, so the USB drive boot is not necessary. And it's still cheaper than a Trezor.
But in most circles, Trezor is the best hardware wallet.

I don't think the price was high before the hack. I think it was very low.
A couple of weeks before the hack was The Halving. Just before The Halving, the price was just over $600. So after The Halving it should be on it's way to $1,200, not down to the $530's.
The price right now (if the hack didn't happen) would be around $720.

How is taking credit cards and cash profitable, and taking bitcoin isn't?
With taking credit cards there is a transaction fee, a percentage fee, and charge backs.
With taking cash there is a lot of counterfeit bills that will make their way into your cash register.
With taking bitcoin, there are NO FEES charged to the merchant. The customer pays a small transaction fee (typically 4 to 8 cents). The merchant can convert the bitcoin back into cash for 1% (much less than credit card fees) at the end of every day, or keep it in bitcoin for 6 months to a year and cash out at a much higher value (most likely). Or, the merchant can convert 90% into cash every day and keep 10% in bitcoin as an investment. Or really any percentage he wants.
So with bitcoin there is virtually no counterfeiting (double-spends) for these small transactions, and it's only a 1% fee to convert into cash (which is a much smaller fee than the credit card fees and charge backs).
So.... How is it not profitable by accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:11:43
Sure, why not $10,000? I'm not saying it will get there tomorrow, next month, or next year. But 3 to 8 years?.... It's possible.
Clif High, a guy who uses his own program called Web Bot which analyzes language on the internet, makes bitcoin price predictions.
In July 2015 he said that in early Dec 2015 it will be $420, and he was right.
In Dec 2015 he said it will be $650 in July 2016, and he was right.
In July 2016 he said it will be $14,000 in July 2017. Wow!!! This one is much harder to believe. I guess it could happen if there is a major explosion in bitcoin use in late 2016 or early 2017.
I think I'm a little more realistic with my $10,000 prediction in 3 to 8 years.
@_date: 2016-08-21 04:25:17
Yes, ok, but we don't know (or at least I haven't heard yet) about the bitcoin that was stolen. What percentage of it was in the exchange's cold storage? What percentage was in just a regular exchange wallet. And what percent was set to sell when it hit a certain price?
If ANY of it was in some sort of cold storage, then there was a major issue with the exchange's cold storage protocols.
If ANY of it was just sitting an the exchange's wallet, that's the fault of the user.
If ANY of it was set to sell, well, you have to put bitcoin on an exchange in order to sell it. You can't blame the user for this.

I was just trying to point out that the problem isn't with bitcoin, it was with the policy the pizza place has to handle a bitcoin payment, and that the negative attributes of cash and credit cards outweighs the negative attributes of bitcoin.
I'm not really saying businesses should STOP accepting cash and/or credit cards. I'm saying they should accept cash, credit cards, and bitcoin. And if they did, the form of payment that would be best for the merchant (shop owner) would be bitcoin.
I don't envision businesses accepting bitcoin as the ONLY method of payment, at least not anytime soon. BUT THEY COULD! There's really noting to stop it. In this country (USA), businesses and people have to pay taxes. And when they do, they have to pay in US Currency. So a business that only accepted bitcoin would just have to convert enough of it's income into USD to pay it's taxes and other bills which don't accept bitcoin. Which will only cost the business 1% for the conversion. So technically, it could be done. But today this would be very hard to do. There are too many people who want to pay in cash or credit cards. The merchant would be turning away too many customers. But one day... Maybe 2 decades from now. You might see cash and bitcoin only merchants (no credit cards). Or maybe even bitcoin only merchants.
I think you will see this with on-line companies first. A merchant selling things on-line can't accept cash. They pretty much take credit cards or Paypal only. But credit cards and Paypal have fees for the merchant. Bitcoin has ZERO fees for the merchant, and there is NO risk of a charge back. You get your payment. After one confirmation you package and ship. SO much better than credit cards or Paypal.
Paypal will take 3% of the merchant's money. And credit cards take a small transaction fee (10 to 25 cents) plus 2 to 4% of the total transaction (depending on the size of your business).
I predict that in 4 to 6 years, Paypal and credit card companies will start to lower their fees to try and keep companies from switching to accepting bitcoin. They are going to have get their fees close to 1%.

So you're saying that they are charging 35% on this $5 transaction only because it's a small transaction? On a larger transaction they'll charge more?
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:33:25
So all transactions are final, until there is a major hack or theft. That's a fine line you're walking there.
In theory it makes sense. When a bank robber is caught with the money he stole (eventually) it goes back to the bank.

Matt Dababneh is just another liberal politician who wants to regulate something before he even understands it.
He reminds me of a Washington politician who said "We need to ban the production of 30 round clips. Then when they are all used up, they'll be gone." Hahahaha!!!! What a MORON!!!! 30 round clips can simply be reloaded!!!! It takes less than a minute!!!
She didn't know what she was talking about! She didn't understand the issue. Yet she was trying to control and regulate it. 
Look at this at this YouTube clip (this link will start at the last 30 seconds of the video), you can hear the people LAUGHING at her when she's done, because she doesn't know what she's talking about. [DumbAssPolitician](
Unlike 30 round clips, bitcoin is a very new technology and evolving fast. Today's bitcoin is very different from bitcoin in 2014. And the bitcoin in 2018 will be extremely different than the bitcoin of today.
How can you even THINK about regulating something that's changing so quickly?!?!?! How about we study bitcoin, learn all we can about it, see were it goes in 6 to 8 years, and then think about MAYBE regulating it.

Yes, but what I'm getting at is that people shouldn't simply give up like that. They should focus their attention on fixing the problem... Catching the thief and improving security.
There has got to be a way to fix this issue. Check out trilli0nn's comment. I like his idea about special addresses.
Maybe his idea could really work, maybe it wont. But that's the attitude we should have.... How can we fix this! Not bailing out and washing our hands of the whole thing.

That really sucks about the $75. But you're not really out that money. You're still holding the Microsoft Currency, right? HOPEFULLY Microsoft will offer something that you want and can use the "Microsoft Currency" to purchase that item.
If you can't use it for the Gold Subscription, what can you use it for? New hardware? New games?
As far as the NO REFUND policy goes.... I guess it's like buying a gift card at Target (or any other store). Once you give them $50 cash and receive a $50 gift card, you CAN NOT get any cash back. You HAVE to buy stuff at Target with that card.
You do have one other course of action (to get your $75 back). Ask all your friends and family (your kid's friends too) if they plan on buying anything from Microsoft soon (that can be purchased with Microsoft Money). If so, you can buy it for them then they can pay you back. 
Personally, I HATE Microsoft. For so many reasons. But I have to use Windows OS because of programs I have to use for work. As linux (releases like Ubuntu) become more and more advanced, with business software I can work with, I'm hoping one day I can tell Microsoft to go "F" themselves.
For the most part, Microsoft has a monopoly on home and business OS's. Apple and Linux are a small piece of the OS pie. And this is why Microsoft can get away with stuff like this. There aren't many alternatives for the average consumer. But every day, more and more people at switching to Apple and Linux, and these OS's are getting more advanced and compatible with business software. And I can't wait for the day when I can say "Microsoft is dead!"

Well... atombit has a video on YouTube that shows them buying bitcoin through Paypal (was uploaded Feb, 2016).
It shows the current price of bitcoin being $380.52 USD.
In the demo they buy $5 worth using Paypal.
They end up with 0.00849 BTC, or $3.23 USD.
That means Atombit kept $1.77 USD.
1.77 divided by 5.00 = 0.354
This tells us...
Atombit charged a 35.4% fee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow!!!! That's a HIGH fee!!!!
Why are they charging so much? Probably because of charge backs. Paypal purchases are subject to charge backs. If the charge back is successful, Atombit will lose those funds. To make up for that, Atombit is charging a VERY high fee.
But I don't know how they are getting away with this. As far as I know, Paypal has a policy that you can NOT buy bitcoins using your Paypal account.

Yes, you're right, but it's not the attitude we should have. Bitcoin hasn't been around for 7 and a half years just so some hackers can make the price drop 19%.

In bitcoin, you need a private key and a public key to store (or hold) the bitcoin in an address on the blockchain. The private key is only used when you want to send the bitcoin to another address. The public key is used to send bitcoin to that address.
Using a software wallet, like on a smartphone or on a computer, both of these keys are handled by the software. For the most part, you really only see the public keys (to add more bitcoin to the wallet) and the software safely (for the most part) stores the private keys hidden away.
So on a paper wallet, the private key and public key are printed out on the paper. The private key looks like random numbers and letters 32 places long and a QR Code that can be scanned by the camera on your cellphone or webcam on your computer, to add bitcoin to that wallet. Also, the private key, 51 places long and a QR Code, is also printed on this paper. ANYONE how can see and copy or scan this private key and send the bitcoin to any address they like. So you MUST keep that private.
There is a website ( that will allow you to print out paper wallets... BUT, there's a problem... Any computer connected to the internet COULD have a virus that's watching everything you do, and send this information back to the creator of the virus. That's not good. But of course, there is a way around this.
That website can be downloaded as a file and saved on a flash drive. Then, you'll need a computer that can boot from a CLEAN install of Windows or Linux, with NO connection to the internet. Then connect a USB printer (no wireless connection) to this computer and put the flash drive in with the webpage file on it. Open the file with whatever browser comes with the operating system, and BAM!!!... You have a paper wallet generator, on a secure computer, that's NOT connected to he internet. Generate and print out as many paper wallets as you like.
So now you have a paper wallet you can put bitcoins on by scanning the public key, and you spend the bitcoin by scanning the private key. Now the chore is keeping the private key, private. If you have a secure safe at your house, that's bolted to the concrete foundation, you might feel safe keeping the paper wallets in there. If not, you might want to keep them in a Safe Deposit Box at a bank... Hey!!!... Banks are good for something.
If they are in a Safe Deposit Box, you really don't have much to worry about. In a safe at home, you only have to worry about a break in, or fire damage if your house burns down. But besides that, your bitcoins are safe.
With software wallets (phone or computer) you still have to worry about viruses. Never keep too much bitcoin in them. Us paper wallets or hardware wallets (Trezor or Ledger Nano) to store most of your bitcoins LONG TERM.

I'm with you ballsack.... The way you sent the BTC is reasonable. But I don't think the fault is with you or BTC. It's with the pizza place.
I've been sending and receiving BTC for ~2 years now. I use Mycelium with the fee set to normal, and I'd have to say that on average, the transaction gets 1 confirmation in ~10 minutes. But that's "on average". Sometimes is takes 2 or 3 minutes, and one time it took 95 minutes. But this the NATURE of BTC, and you can't blame BTC for what it's meant to do..... A 10 minute confirmation, on average, with a reasonable fee.
Things like SegWit and Thunder Network might make transactions faster in the near future, but for the time being, we have a 10 minute average wait time.
I blame the pizza place's policy.... 15 minute confirmation or your BTC are gone!!!!! No, way!!!! They should give you a choice when ordering....
1) Pay with BTC. They start making the pizza immediately. The pizza will be ready in ~15 minutes, if there are no confirmations on the BTC, you will pay in cash, and after there is a confirmation your BTC will be returned.
2) Pay with BTC, but do NOT start making the pizza until there is 1 confirmation. This might take 2 minutes, 10 minutes, or three hours... But you're willing to wait. And of course, typically it will take ~10 minutes.
This 15 minutes then "poof" policy is ridiculous. The pizza place should refund your BTC just as soon as there is 1 confirmation. It doesn't matter if they are using their own BTC address, Coinbase, or Bitpay. At some point, the pizza place will have control of your BTC and should refund it. Or they could give you an "IOU 1 PIZZA" coupon for a later date. They should SOMEHOW make it right.
What they really should do is.... Just make the damn pizza as soon as they see the transaction with zero confirmations. What are they thinking??? Do they think you're going to attempt a double-spend for a damn pizza?!?!?!?! That $31 order probably cost them $10 in ingredients and labor. Just make the damn pizza. 999 times out of 1,000 the person buying with BTC is not trying to double-spend.
Here in the USA, pizza places get counterfeit $5's, $10's, and $20's all the time. (my friend works at a bank) The pizza place tries to check every bill, but some counterfeits make it into the cash register. The bank finds $5 to $100 worth of counterfeit bills in the pizza place's deposits almost every week. It's just a part of doing business.

Yes. It's actually about 0.87% of the total coins. Inactive coins (people are just holding) should be counted, but lost coins (forgotten passwords and computer crashes without backups) shouldn't be counted. This number would be hard to guesstimate. It might bring it up to 1%. Which is a HUGE amount. Yes. I said that. MUCH bigger than any bank robbery.
Yet our attitude should be the same. We should take a much harder look at ways to secure these coins. And NOT give up, sell them all, and wash your hands of the whole idea.
How about this...
When you send bitcoins to an exchange, they are immediately put into a SECURE cold storage and then you are issued a coin unique to the exchange. A Bitfinex.coin or token. So it's only these tokens that are traded in and out of accounts on the exchage, and bitcoins ONLY go in or out of cold storage when they come in or out of the exchange.
Each exchange could have it's own centralized blockchain to keep track of it's coins. No one would try to hack these coins. They are worthless unless you're a user on the exchange with bitcoins backing them up in cold storage.
The bitcoins in cold storage would be like the gold that used to back the US dollar, locked safely away until the user withdrawals. This would probably slow down withdrawals, but that's a small price to pay to make sure your coins are safe on the exchange.
Of course, you still have to worry about someone inside the exchange. An inside job. But at least this could eliminate outside hackers.

What are the incentives to running a Bitcoin Node?
* Broadcasting and receiving transactions from your own node is a safer way to participate in the Bitcoin Network. When you run a node, **you** control the software it runs. When **you** download and install the node software from Core, **you know** it's the original software that hasn't been tampered with, so you can trust it more.
* You are contributing to the Bitcoin Network.
* Running the software version you support (Core, Knots, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin XT) tells the world which version you feel is the best way forward. This is the closest thing to "voting" in Bitcoin. (miner signaling is not voting)
Show the world, and the Core Devs, your support for Core by running a node with Core software.
Yes... There are 2793 (2822 right now) nodes running 0.15.1... But there are almost **6,000** nodes running 0.15.x.x, and if you count the 0.14.0 nodes it goes up to **~7,000**.
So run a node and let **your voice be heard!!!** Run a node to show support for the project **you support!!!**
And please people, update your node to the latest version.

If you really want to know (and average) of what it's pulling, get a meter that displays Kwh. Leave it connected and running for 24 hours. Look at the Kwh and divide it by 24. That should give you a pretty good average of the watts it's pulling.
Of course, for a better average run this setup for 7 days then divide the Kwh by 168.

[Scaling Bitcoin](
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:51:07
I believe the voting period is the same as a difficulty period, 2016 blocks (or about 2 weeks).
If SegWit gets 95% of the votes in this period, it gets LOCKED in. Then, there is another 2016 block period to give time to the miners (mining pools) that haven't upgraded to upgrade. At the end of that 2016 block period, SegWit goes LIVE.
At this point, any mining pools that haven't upgraded to SegWit will not get the block reward if they find a block. Their block will be orphaned.
@_date: 2017-02-02 21:09:28
Bigger blocks need to happen at some point. Bigger blocks will happen at some point. But that will take a hard fork, and right now is not a good time for a hard fork.
KNOWING that bigger blocks are coming, I'm not really sure they the Bigger Block people are so against SegWit. Yes.... It is a big, complicated change to Bitcoin, but it has been tested more thoroughly than any other update. And not only will it fix malleability, it will also allow for the Lightening Network, AND has the effect of bigger blocks because it fits more transactions into each block.
The Big Blockers say "Signalling for SegWit is giving the Core Devs everything they want!" I say "Signalling for SegWit is moving forward with the BEST option the Core Devs could come up at this time. SegWit is good for Bitcoin now, and bigger blocks will come later."
In this video ( timestamp) Roger Ver is asked "Do you think we should activate SegWit now?" and he says "I'm agnostic on the whole thing, and my biggest complaint is the censorship that goes on in r/bitcoin."
Wow!!!!! Ok... Let's look at these two things (agnostic, and censorship in r/bitcoin) one at a time.
Is he really holding an agnostic (noncommittal) position? I say no, he isn't. He runs a mining pool (bitcoin.com, yes, it's a website and a mining pool) and that mining pool is voting NOT READY for SegWit, which is a vote AGAINST SegWit. You can either vote NOT READY or YES for SegWit. There isn't a NO POSITION vote. So his mining pool is basically voting NO for SegWit, while he's saying "I'm not for or against Segwit." Once again, Roger contradicts himself and doesn't understand what he's talking about.
Censorship in r/bitcoin:
Wow!!!!! His biggest complaint about Segwit is the censorship in r/bitcoin?!?!?!?!?!?!?! OMG!!!! One has NOTHING to do with the other!!!! The Core Devs to NOT control or moderate r/bitcoin.
Wow!!!.... This would be like me saying "I'm against Hillary because some forum (that has NOTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY) won't let me speak my mind about Hillary. Wow!!!! Can you say "Spoiled little brat having a temper tantrum."??? 
The Core Devs have given a lot of consideration to bigger blocks. They have not simply said "No! No bigger blocks and that's it!" They have looked at all the proposals... 17% increase every year... 2,4,6 steps... You name it, they looked into it. They don't think bigger blocks is a good way to go right now.
Roger seems like a nice guy. And I'm sure he means well. But if you're not really against SegWit, and THE ABSOLUTE BEST MINDS in bitcoin (who know the bitcoin code better than anyone) say this is the best way forward right now, should you give them the benefit of the doubt?!?!?!
I mean.... If you had rock-solid data against SegWit, that would be different. But if your best argument against it is "There's too much censorship on r/bitcoin." THAT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT AGAINST SegWit!!!!!! Hello!!!! McFly!!!!
Oh my goodness... Sorry. Basically... If you run across someone who's against SegWit, point them at this video. If they don't see the light after watching this video, they'll probably never see the light.

If you have a new Ledger Nano (this does NOT apply to the Nano S) I **highly recommend** initializing your Nano with the **Ledger Live** OS.
You can download a copy of the OS from Ledger as an ISO file. Write the file to a USB flash drive. Then, disconnect your computer from the internet (just to be sure) and boot from the USB flash drive.
This way, any virus your computer might have will not be able to run while booted from the flash drive. It's not a Windows OS.

Either way... It's a very lame reason to not support SegWit.

I never said Roger leads the Chinese miners. But he does seem to have lot of influence with a lot of people, and maybe even some Chinese pools.
I'm hoping that maybe some english speaking Chinese will see comments from here that are pro-SegWit, and maybe these comments will influence them, a little. Maybe enough one day that they start supporting SegWit.
Please..... Tell me more details about the Hong Kong Agreement. I read that the Core Devs made this agreement with them, but I also read Blockstream made the agreement with them.

Miners: Yes. After activation, miners and pools that haven't upgraded yet will have 2 weeks to upgrade. That's what I said. I just left off the part about "if they don't, their blocks will be orphaned."
Nodes: Nodes can do whatever they want??? I didn't know that. I thought that once SegWit went live, they'd have to be running a SegWit version to participate in the network. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:13:23
Sometimes, you have to fight fire with fire.
If that conference call didn't make Roger Ver switch his mining pool over to support SegWit, I don't know what will.
If you can think of something that might make him see the light, I'm listening. But in the mean time, the only thing I can think of is to try to convince some of the people who are following him, to think twice about following him.

From what I understand, the PBOC didn't "shut down" the Chinese exchange. The PBOC had the exchanges stop BTC, LTC, or ETH to be withdrawn. They are allowed to withdrawal CYN, but not crypto-currencies. 
The exchanges are still accepting deposits, and trading is still happening. Just no withdrawals of cryptos until more KYC/AML is in place.
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:37:48


"impossible".... It's so absolute. How about "extremely unlikely"?
Sure.... Maybe it's **almost** impossible to get everyone in the world to switch when BTC = $1,000,000, but what about the vast majority? What happens if a country says "We are now switching to uBTC unit for bitcoin." then pretty much everyone in that country switches.
What happens if 100 countries then follow suit and make the same announcement within a year? Then what will happen the next year?
So will **everyone** in the world switch?... Probably not. But what if several of the big counties (USA, Russia, China, England, Japan) announce that uBTC is now the standard, then maybe 150 other countries that deal with these countries followed suit to be on the same page as them. It would be the majority of the world using uBTC.... Pretty much, everyone who matters would be using uBTC.
Bitcoin has opened so many new doors, and changed so many things that a lot of people thought would never change. You just don't know what the future brings. There's no way to know what this technology will end up doing, or which direction it's headed.
When Bitcoin's price drops 30% or more, articles are written about how "Bitcoin Is Dead", but it doesn't die, it just keeps going on. Then, just when you think things are getting a little boring, SegWit is release (and hopefully accepted later this year) which will then allow the Lightening Network to be added.
And if that's not enough, some anonymous person drops of MimbleWimble at Bitcoin's doorstep. Wow!!!! What a technology!!! There is no way to know what the next great thing around the corner for Bitcoin will be.

I do not believe your statement is true. Block size could be 0.25meg, and LN could do 100,000 TPS. The LN transactions are OFF the Bitcoin blockchain. Only LN settlement (after MANY transactions) is on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:37:18


Did you listen to the whole 2 hour video? He says negative things about SegWit that SIMPLY ARE NOT TRUE. And the other guests point out how wrong he is.


Personally, I don't think he has the capacity to understand Bitcoin to the level of actually knowing for himself, if bigger blocks or SegWit is best right now. If this is the case, he should put his faith in the Core Devs, or start his own BU chain.


Reading the code and fully understanding the core are two separate things ENTIRELY. Bitcoin, at it's core is complicated. SegWit adds a whole new level of complexity. I'm confident that far less then 0.00001% of the earth's population understand this close to how the Core Devs understand it.
My best guess would be that 95% of people who own bitcoin have an understanding of all of this that the Core Devs would consider elementary or less.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:27:11
Yes... To nodes running SegWit. But to nodes not yet running SegWit, they will basically see 1meg blocks, yet they will hold the amount of transactions that would typically fit into a 1.6 to 2meg block.
Quote from Core:
"Since old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data. 
New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB)."
@_date: 2017-02-15 16:42:42


Yes. I agree. My point is that snoggish said "The PBOC shut them down", and they didn't. The PBOC only stopped the exchanges from allowing crypto-currency withdrawals.
If trading is allowed, and deposits are allowed, I wouldn't say the exchanges were "shut down."
As far as the KYC/AML regulations go.... YES! These types of regulations keep too close of an eye on ALL customers, when only customers under the suspicion of wrongdoing should be watched.
Regulations should HELP or PROTECT the average customer, not watch every move they make. Watching EVERY customer is harassment and an invasion of privacy.
Regulation should be all about the exchange doing things right like, showing **real** buy/sell orders, making sure trade fees are within acceptable parameters, and proper storage of customer funds.
(I am in the USA, so of course my opinion doesn't matter much in China.... Hell, it doesn't matter much in the US. But I'm in favor of these types of regulations {*that protect the customer*} in the US and around the world.)
Too much regulations on the exchanges would, of course, be bad. Exchanges (like Businesses in general) need freedom to do things their way and be unique, but they can't be reckless with other people's money.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:30:52
Yes, you are correct. I just said what I've been saying for about a year. Things change fast in Bitcoin. I guess things in Bitcoin change faster than I change.
With so many nodes switched over now, I should probably stop saying it like that. I'll try to remember in the future to simply say "SegWit will effectively give us 1.6 to 2meg blocks."
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:11:22
KYC is great? KYC is regulation. Regulation is GREAT when it's regulating a company to protect the consumer. But when the regulation starts invading the consumer's rights, or privacy, that's too much regulation!!!

Yes, they are kind of a pain and tend to get boring after a while.
But, they are easy to pass up. They also make it easy to see the price is moving A LOT. Of course, I typically know this already since I check the price at least 10 times a day.
All-in-all, they are pretty harmless and just people having fun with the price. I say, leave them alone.

I don't know EXACTLY what happen between Roger and r/bitcoin.
I have heard that all of his posts were deleted. I hear that he was banned from r/bitcoin.
Which one of these that really happened doesn't matter, and it not the point.
In this video he says.... And I quote..... "My biggest complain about SegWit is the censorship that goes on at r/bitcoin."
Wow!!! What does censorship in a forum have to do with the pros or cons of SegWit?!?!?!!?
Should everyone be heard in r/bitcoin, YES! And the only people who get your posts deleted or completely banned from r/bitcoin, should be people who break the rules the forum, and NOT because of their opinion.
But making the (possible) poor management of a forum, your main reason to be against SegWit, is NOT a good reason to be against SegWit. This is my point.

Thanks you for the summery of all the "drama." Boy.... That's a mess.
But from what I know about BU and SegWit, it sure seems like SegWit is the way to go.
The Bitcoin Core Devs are the best coders out there, and maybe I have too much faith in them, but I'm sure they have given much thought to going different ways, but SegWit is best for Bitcoin right now.
I wouldn't call them "small blockers" because it seems like they don't **WANT** small blocks, they just think a hard fork wouldn't be good for Bitcoin right now.
In my view, it's hard to fault them when they are only looking out for Bitcoin.
And I know the miners not supporting SegWit are doing what they think is best, but The Core Devs are **in the code up to their eyeballs!** They know the code **inside and out**. So when they say "SegWit is the way to go right now." I'm sorry, but I got to support The Core Devs, and SegWit.
I just want what's best for Bitcoin, and to move on.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:09:49
Not only is a HF very risky right now in Bitcoin, it would be better to increase the block size a year or two down the road.
SegWit is a much better way to go. First of all, it's only a soft fork. Second, it will allow about twice as many transactions to fit into the same 1meg block. (Making 2meg blocks not needed right now, but down the road, yes still needed.) Third, it will allow for addons like Lightening Network, which will make the maximum transactions per second go up to around 100,000 per second.
Listen to this 2 hour video. I learned a lot from it.
I learned that Roger Ver's MAIN COMPLAINT about SegWit is that he got kicked out of r/bitcoin. Wow!!!! The benefits SegWit brings to the table HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH r/bitcoin!!! SegWit isn't a moderator on r/bitcoin. The Core Devs aren't moderators on r/bitcoin. And, Roger Ver's thoughts on bigger blocks and SegWit ARE KNOWN by the Core Devs.
I recommend listening to the whole 2 hours of this video.

@_date: 2017-02-07 18:04:37
Oh, I see.
But it doesn't look like the nodes are staying on pre-SegWit versions anyway. With ~50% of them running Segwit and ~25% of mining pools, the nodes are switching over twice as fast as the mining pools.
I sure hope a lot more pools switch over this summer and and fall. It sure would be nice to have more transactions per block, bigger blocks, malleability fixed, and the ability to add layers like the Lightening Network by November.

Not everyone gets SegWit. Roger Ver doesn't get SegWit.
He doesn't even seem to get his own feelings about it.
Whale Pool hosted a conference call in Dec 2016 of which Roger Ver was a part of.  [Scaling Debate]( It's a 2 hour video but this link starts at 51 minutes, when Roger is asked the question below. But I suggest you listen to the hole 2 hours. There's a lot of good info in there.
In this video, Roger is asked "Do you think we should activate SegWit now?" First he seems to lie about his position on SegWit, then gives **the most lame reason** I've ever heard.
1st he says "I'm agnostic on SegWit." Wow! What? Woooow!!!! He's "agnostic"?... When pretty much everything he says about it is negative (and wrong), or some type of negative spin that's not true. Not to mention, his mining pool is voting NO on SegWit. When you're voting NO on something, you're not "agnostic" on it, you're against it. Either he doesn't understand the meaning of agnostic, or he's lying to himself and everyone else.
The 2nd thing he says is "My **BIGGEST complaint** is the censorship that goes on in a forum." Wow!!! (again!) SegWit doesn't run this forum. SegWit isn't a moderator in this forum. The Core Devs are not moderators in this forum. In this forum there is talk about SegWit (positive and negative), but what the hell does the way some forum is being run, have to do with whether or not SegWit is good for Bitcoin??? One has nothing to do with the other!
Really?!?!?!... How **lame** is that? Because he's all butt-hurt about one thing, he's going to take it out on something else?!?! Kind of reminds me of a 5 year old having a temper tantrum.
Everyone should listen to the whole 2 hours. There's is a lot of good info throughout the conference call.

@_date: 2017-02-07 18:14:07
Wow! Even THAT is a better argument against SegWit, than Roger's argument against SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:15:18
Yes. This is very true, Ver was out numbered and he's not a technical person. BUT!....... If his  reason, that he can come up with (against SegWit), is that he was kicked out of r/bitcoin..... Maybe he should stop talking CRAP about SegWit until he has some sort of VALID argument against it. Maybe he should have his mining pool support SegWit until he can think of ONE halfway decent reason  to not support it.
I only know so much about the technical end of Bitcoin. You only know so much about the technical end of Bitcoin. Roger Ver only know so much (seems to be very little) about the technical end of Bitcoin. There are very few people on Earth that even come close to knowing the Bitcoin Code as well as the Core Devs. The Core Devs have brought Bitcoin to this point so far, I'm pretty sure they know what's best for Bitcoin better then just about anyone else. And when they say they have giving a lot thought to bigger blocks and have come to the conclusion that bigger blocks are NOT the best way forward at this time.... They are probably right, since they know all the ins-N-outs about the code better best. It's a pretty damn good bet that SegWit is the best way to go right now.
They worked LONG AND HARD on SegWit. It has been the most tested upgrade of Bitcoin to date. They know bigger block will come later. SegWit is the best way forward right now.
@_date: 2017-02-03 22:12:23
And what are Roger Ver's thoughts on the question "Do you think we should activate SegWit now?"
His answer is pretty vague to say the least. His answer has two parts...
1) He first talks about how he's "agnostic" on SegWit. Which isn't really true. He runs a mining pool. Every time this mining pool finds a block, his pool votes NO READY or basically NO for SegWit. There is no agnostic or "not one way or the other" vote for SegWit. When you find a block, you either vote YES or NO. Since his pool is voting NO, I wouldn't say that's agnostic. I would say he's NOT for SegWit.
2) His second part of his answer, or his "Biggest complaint about SegWit" is that he was kicked out of r/bitcoin." What!!!!! r/bitcoin has nothing to do with the development or benefits of SegWit!!! SegWit DIDN'T kick him out of r/bitcoin. The Core Devs DIDN'T kick him out of r/bitcoin. What in the world does "getting kicked out of r/bitcoin" have to do with voting YES or NO on SegWit?!?!
Is he just taking is frustrations about r/bitcoin and pointing them at SegWit?!?! Why??? Is he simply having a temper tantrum like a 5 year old? Wow! I just don't know about him.
This would be like me saying "I'm not for Hillary because I got kicked out of a forum (that is not controlled by Hillary) for talking about Hillary." Wow! Would that make any sense at all?
Here is the video starting at the question (51 minutes in). But after you listen to his answer, I suggest everyone listens to the whole 2 hour video. There's A LOT of good stuff in there.
[Roger Ver's Answer](
@_date: 2017-02-27 19:30:29
I agree with Jonny. Well before the year 2140 the Bitcoin network will handling 100's of thousands of transactions per second (on chain). Even it it's only 50,000 transactions per second and the average transaction fee is $0.05, that's $1,500,000 worth of fees per block (not even counting the block reward at that time).
In the first 8 years of Bitcoin, the Home Miner has pretty much gone extinct. The fast majority of mining is done by Mining Farms now. Who's to say that it will always be this way....
It very well could happen that in the next 25 to 50 years, Mining Farms will go extinct. Replaced by Corporate Mining.... Large national corporations and multinational corporations will do the vast majority of the mining, maybe even at a loss, because most of their customers want to use Bitcoin. But, the amount of money they will lose mining (if they are mining at a loss) will be LESS then the credit card fees they pay now, so they will be happy to do it.
Companies like:
Home Depot
Best Buy
Carl's Jr.
Del Taco
It would be smart for all of these companies to mine as a loss of $100's of thousands, which will save them millions in credit card fees.
If in 50 years, about 50% of the customers want to pay in Bitcoin, Corporate Mining could really take off. They might even be able to do it at a profit.
When Walmart starts accepting Bitcoin, WHO KNOWS what's going to happen!!! But what I do know is that it will be exciting to see!
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:47:29
Yes. I know. And I'm against it. I'm for regulations that PROTECT the customer from unsafe practices of the exchange. I'm against regulations that harass and invade the privacy of the customer.
If you read what I wrote above, I mention KYC/AML regulations and how they are bad.
And any regulations that would keep trade fees at acceptable levels and keep majority of the bitcoin they are holding in cold storage would be good.

He comes across as being use to... Not keeping score. Everyone wins just for trying. And everyone gets a trophy for showing up.
This is not a 3rd grade soccer league, this is real life. Only the best ideas win, and the rest fade away.
SegWit is the best way forward. Get on-board with SegWit or go start your own alt-coin with the BU code.
Maybe BU will kick BTC's butt, and we'll all be on the BU chain in a year or 2.
But to hang around the BTC community crying about being kicked out of a forum, that has NOTHING to do with SegWit, and that's your MAIN REASON for not liking SegWit, is just so...... 3rd grade temper tantrum.
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:33:25
Blockstream is a company that helps provide funding for the development of Bitcoin Core. The Core Devs work on the code to fix bugs and make improvements. The Core Devs have looked all the different ways to proceed including a straight blocksize increase. They came to the conclusion that SegWit is a better way to go at this time. Bigger blocks are needed, and bigger blocks are coming, it's a sure thing. Just not right now.
SegWit IS A COMPROMISE! It give almost everyone what they want.  People who want a malleability fix, it gives them that. People who want it to be easier to add layers like Lightening Network, it gives them that. People who want bigger blocks.... It give them that too!...
Straight from Core about what SegWit will do to the blocksize....
"Since old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data. New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to **raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB**, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an **effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB**)."

I don't think so. I think once BTC switched to a 5 minute block time and a 1meg block size, it would be some time before a lot of blocks would fill up. At that time, increase the block size to 2megs. When that's too small, increase to 4megs. When that's too small, which to a 2.5 minute block time. The 10 minute block time is just too long. At some point, it's going to have to go lower or some other Alt-Coin will overtake BTC.

Very good points pecathor.
I really didn't mean to convey that the amount of BTC you plan on holding is the ONLY factor, but it is a major one.
I don't think your 2nd bullet point "works with your mobile phone" is a factor because BOTH the Trezor and Ledger work with mobile phones. I know the Ledger does, and I'm pretty sure the Trezor does too.
I also think your 3rd bullet point is pretty much equal with both devices.

Oh, I never heard of 3rd party firmware for this router. If this is the case, it sure would be better than solo mining... But still not worth the effort.
But, if you just wanted to be able to say "Yes, I'm mining Bitcoin. I support the Bitcoin Network." This would be a very cheap and easy way of doing that.
But at 5.5GH is a **very** slow mining speed. making about $0.01 every 10 days (soon to be 11, then 12, then 13...) I guess if Bitcoin goes to $50,000 soon, it might be worth it.
I service accounts all over town and manage their WiFi. I could easily tell them they need to upgrade this new WiFi router for $50 and I'm sure I could get at lease 10 of them to do it. So now I'm having **them** pay for the router, I'm mining with **their** electricity, and I have them set to mine for me on **my** favorite pool (signaling for SegWit or course) (With 3rd party firmware allowing me to do this) all for FREE!!!! (Assuming $50 will cover the $39 price + shipping from China.).
So, after setting up 10 of these, with my accounts paying for the hardware and using their electricity, there's **ZERO** cost to me and I'm making $0.01 per day.... Soon to be $0.009 per day, and $0.008 soon after that.
Even if the price of Bitcoin doubles or triples by the end of this year, I don't see it being worth the hassle.
If any of these accounts found out what I was doing, I could lose the account, and possibly my reputation resulting in losing more accounts all over town. And for what?.... A penny a day? I don't think so.
With the difficulty going up every 2 weeks and another block reward halving in about 3 years, it won't be long when this router is going to make a penny per year. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 22:07:56
Yes.... Well... I would say that SegWit's reputation does suffer (mostly or a lot) because of Roger's RANTING about r/bitcoin and SegWit. With no real substance (from Roger) about SegWit. And this is not a good reason for SegWit to suffer.

I've owned a Ledger Nano for 8 months now and like it a lot. Seems to be working really good for me. I'm sure the Trezor is better, but costs about 3 times as much. I'd say... If you're planning on holding 200 BTC's or less, the Ledger Nano (or Ledger HW.1 - even cheaper) is a great option. Plan on holding over 200 BTC, pay the extra money and get a Trezor.
I hope I have the need for a Trezor one day.

OK.... According to this, the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus was made up of "Representatives from the bitcoin industry" (consisting of Chinese Bitcoin exchanges and 10 (I think) of Chinese mining pools) and "Members of the development community" (consisting of 5 Core Contributors), and others.
They came to an agreement on Feb 21st, 2016.
The 2 main points are...
1) They came to an understanding that SegWit will continue to be developed and is like to proceed towards release over the next 2 months, as scheduled.
Well.... They missed that schedule. It wasn't release until late October and the first signaling didn't start until mid November (if I remember correctly).
2) The Bitcoin Core Contributors **present at the Roundtable** will have an implementation a hard-fork **available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core** within three months after the release of SegWit.
January would have been 3 months since the release of SegWit. But I'm not sure if such a proposal has been made **from the Core Contributors that were at the Roundtable, to Bitcoin Core.**

Now it's Sunday morning. I turned my computer on, plugged in my Ledger Nano, and again I'm in my wallet in less than 10 seconds.
With this type of technology, you almost have to expect some programming issues from time-to-time. But when things start to go wrong, and you don't know why, and money is involved, I start to assume the worst.
I'm so glad it's only an API programming issue, there's nothing wrong with my Ledger Nano, and my BTC's are safe.

Wow!... You don't think blocking a pool who's forking and threatening an attack on Bitcoin is a little different than rolling back because you entered a price wrong?
I've heard Andreas talking about blocking bad actors if needed, but I've never heard of it being done, or how it could be done.
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:50:41
Yes. I understand this. And if you took that last 1,000 blocks and averaged their times, it would probably be pretty close to 10 minutes. Which I think at some point that's just going to be too long. I'd really like to see a 5 minutes block time (target). Maybe as fast as 2.5 minutes at some point. But I really don't see (at this time) much of a need to be any faster than 2.5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-02-01 22:29:48
Yes... Both claims are ridiculous, and lack of consensus is obvious (at this point). But I think a lot of the pro SegWit people blame Roger because he's probably the most famous person to be against SegWit. He has a lot of followers who give a lot of weight to his views.
Although a lot of people think Roger's (Bitcoin Jesus) thoughts on the subject are good and valid arguments, I'm not one of those people. If you ask me, Bitcoin Jesus has lost this thorny crown. I saw Roger in an interview with 3 people last month, one of who was a Core Dev. EVERY argument Roger had against SegWit, the Core Dev BLEW APART!!! Almost everything Roger said sounded good at first, but after the Core Dev pointed out how wrong his facts were, and how wrong his thinking was, it's was pretty obvious that Roger Ver DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT! He doesn't fully understand how SegWit works, and doesn't understand all the improvements SegWit will bring to the table.
NOT ALL of the 75% of the pools that are not signaling for SegWit are against SegWit. Some of them simply haven't upgraded YET. What percentage of them account for this, I don't know. Maybe 5%, maybe 40% of them are planning on switching to SegWit support in the coming months. I have heard that this is a very complex upgrade. It's not like.... Download the update, install the update, done.
Another Mining pool (BitMinter) has started signaling for SegWit. Now there are 6.... BitFury, BTCC Pool, BitClub Network, Bitcoin India, Bitminter, and Solo CKPool. And then there is Slush's Pool that let each miner in the pool vote their own way. (Which is usually about 1/3 NOT READY and 2/3 YES for SegWit.
[NOT READY / YES voting](
Slush's Pool is very interesting the way they let each miner vote their own way. I think Slush's Pool, being a pool filled with miners from all around the world, is a better window into what miners (as a whole) think about SegWit. Once all the pools switch, who are planning on switching, the numbers for all the pools might look a lot closer to 33% NOT READY and 66% YES for SegWit. But with 66% signalling for SegWit by late Summer or Fall, that doesn't leave much time to get 95% by November. It's that last 30% that's going to be a bitch. (IMHO)

Will Bitcoin need a block size increase (with SegWit and LN active) sometime in the future?... YES.
Is it possible to do 100,000 TPS (with SegWit and LN active) without any block size increase (beside the increase Segwit will give us)....... YES. It's possible if there are lots of off chain transactions with LN, only going to the BTC chain for settlement.
How about saying it this way?.... With SegWit active (no LN), TPS goes from ~7 to ~14. With SegWit and LN active, TPS go to 10's of thousands, and even more when bigger blocks come down the road.
@_date: 2017-03-31 20:35:49
Yes, I agree with you BashCo.
Also, most people won't even use LN on most transactions. If I wanted to send you some bitcoin, and I don't plan on sending you bitcoin again, or anytime soon, there's **no way** I'd use LN. If I just send you bitcoin (regular), there's 1 transaction fee. If I send you bitcoin using LN, there's a transaction fee to get into LN, then another to pull the bitcoin back out of LN. And if I put 2 BTC into the LN channel, then sent you 1 BTC, then your pulled out that 1 BTC and I pulled out the other one I had left in there, that's 3 transactions... All just to send you 1 BTC.
I could give many other examples, But long story short, most people won't use LN most of the time. And when they do, the miners will profit from people getting in and out of LN. And all the **extra** users and activity is does bring into Bitcoin, the miners will profit. Not to mention, a higher BTC price with more people using BTC and LN. I'm pretty sure the miners would be happy with BTC worth more.
The miners are focusing on **short term** and not seeing the big picture. Long term SegWit and LN will be good for everyone into BTC, including miners.

When you boot to CLI, "startx" just starts the GUI. Mouse/keyboard should work whether you boot to GUI or boot to CLI and enter "startx" to go to GUI.
As far as I know, you do **not** need to call your ISP for a static IP. You're IP address to the internet can by dynamic. Your Raspberry Pi's IP should be static, because you need to pass through port 8333 to the Pi. So if the Pi is set to dynamic, it's IP might change then the router would be passing port 8333 to the wrong IP. This really isn't too much of a problem (to have the Pi set to dynamic) because it runs 24/7 it's unlikely it's address will ever change. If it does, you just have to change the port forwarding to the new address.
I currently have my Pi's address set to dynamic, and it hasn't changed yet. Of course it's only been a few days and a couple of resets because I was changing the Pi's location.
I use Teamviewer all the time with Windows computers, but never with Linux. From what I've read, TightVNC works better with Linux. With my Pi running TightVNC, and my desktop PC running TightVNC Viewer, I remote into my Pi, no problem (as long as it's in GUI mode). But for this Pi (I have several), I have it boot into CLI and run the node from there.

Right.... Roger Ver is NOT for SegWit, but he's not against it either. At least that's what he said in an interview late Dec 2016. He said he's "agnostic" on SegWit. Then goes on to say that his biggest complaint about SegWit is the fact that he got kicked out of r/bitcoin. Wow!!!! Really!!! SegWit isn't a moderator on r/bitcoin. The Core Devs aren't moderators on r/bitcoin. the forum r/bitcoin has NOTHING TO DO WITH SegWit!!!
Here's the video 51 minutes in where he's asked the question "Should SegWit get activated?". After listening to his answer, I suggest listening to the whole 2 hours. There's a lot of good stuff in there. And pretty much everything that Roger thinks is bad about SegWit, is just plain WRONG, and this fact is pointed out by mostly Eric Lombrozo, but Phil Potter and Alex Petrov too.
Roger Ver does NOT have a good reason for being against SegWit.

@_date: 2017-02-05 21:28:52
I disagree.
First of all... I don't believe r/bitcoin is "shoving SegWit down everyone's throats." Most of the talk on r/bitcoin might be pro SegWit, but I still see lots of talk that is negative.
But to use the fact that you were banned from a forum, no matter what forum, as your MAIN REASON to be against something, is asinine.
It's like me saying "I hate you and want you in prison, because I was banned from a forum about your neighbor down the street." One has nothing to do with the other.
SegWit didn't ban Roger. The Core Devs didn't ban Roger. If you don't like SegWit, attack it from it's technical shortcomings, and not because you were banned from a forum which SegWit and the Core Devs have NO CONTROL OVER.

Yes, I agree with what you wrote here. I just don't think there will be many LN transactions. Especially soon after SegWit goes live. LN won't even be active when SegWit goes live. It might take another 3 to 12 months. And even then... I don't think many people will bother with it unless they want their coins mixed and/or kept more private.
The vast majority of people I come across never even heard of Bitcoin (I ask clerks and people at the gas station all the time). And the ones that have, don't have **A CLUE** how BTC works **at all**, and have never heard of Lightning Network.
The people in the forums who know about this stuff, is a tiny, tiny, TINY percentage of people who own, hold, or use BTC. Most of them don't know, and don't care. Only us Bitcoin Nerds in here.
Yes, eventually word will get out. But by that time the user base will be so big the miners won't care how many LN transactions there are. They'll just be glad Bitcoin is **so big!!!**

Yes.... Please re-read my last paragraph.
That's why I said the fees **per transaction** would be about **half** of what they where **about a year ago, before the blocks were all full**.
The result.... With about **twice as many** transactions per block, the miner's fees **per BLOCK** would be about the same as they were about a year ago **before the blocks were all full.**

OK.... Lets say he wasn't lying. He just got it wrong. BOY!!!! That sure is a MAJOR thing to get wrong!!!!!! Lots of people lost tons of money putting their faith on Roger Ver on this one.
Maybe Roger is just simply wrong about SegWit also.
But if he "just got it wrong", if this is truly how he felt..... Why wasn't he speaking from the heart?!?! Why was he reading the statement?!?!???
When you read a statement like this, very often, it's so someone else is making sure you're saying something very specific. Exactly what they want you to say, exactly the way they want you to say it.
This is why terrorist have their hostage read a statement. Very often when a hostage is recorded making a statement, they are reading it. And if you don't read it, word for word, then you're probably going to get beaten, and the recording won't be released.
Now, obviously Roger wasn't being held hostage. So why was he reading a statement and not simply speaking his mind????
I think..... Most likely.... Mark Karpeles wanted him to say some very specific things. And who knows..... Mark probably paid Roger to say it. Why else would the "Bitcoin Jesus" read from a script, and not speak from the heart.

Andreas said "the first video conference **I did**". He didn't say it was the first video conference **ever**.
But lets not split hairs here.... I believe Andreas was referring to the early days of video conferencing, and comparing that to the early days of Bitcoin, which we are in now.
Even though Bitcoin is 8 years old, it had a very slow start and has only begun to even start to get popular the past few years. People **still** refer to Bitcoin as "an experiment." So in the bigger scheme of things, Bitcoin is still in it's very early stage.
About 95% of my family, friends, and coworkers have heard of and/or use YouTube and Skype. About 0.1% of them heard about Bitcoin before I asked them about it, and NONE of them have used or owed Bitcoin.
When that 0.1% gets to about 10% then Bitcoin will be out of it's early stage. I only hope SegWit gets approved before then.
**Come on miners.... WAKE UP!!!**
Yes.... Too many miners are asleep or simply **don't care**. They are just mining to make money, and that's it.
Slush's Pool is the only pool (that I know of) that lets each miner account vote for the blockchain they want.
The current voting right now is....
Core(SegWit) = 34.25%
BU = 11.81%
That's almost 3 to 1 for SegWit.
Then there is Classic, 8MB, and Bitpay, totalling about 11%.
**And here is the kicker!!!!**
26.52% voted Don't Care, and 16.66% simply haven't voted at all!!!! **That's OVER 42% of the miners who just don't give a sh!t!!!** They just mining to mine, and hope everyone else works everything out.
**How does Slush's Pool handle the Don't Care and Not Voted miners?**
The Not Voted miners get split up among all the chains proportionally.
And the Don't Care miners get split up by the pool's AI??????
I don't agree Slush's.... The Don't Care and the Not Voted should all go to the chain that's well into the lead. Core(SegWit) is far past BU by 3 to 1 in votes, and about 150% in hashing power.
The miners supporting Classic, 8MB, and Bitpay are just fine. They are voting for those chains for whatever reasons they have, they hopefully did their research, their votes shouldn't be changes.

I just set up a full node running 0.14.0 on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a 32GB micro SD card installed, and **nothing** else.
The Raspberry Pi 3 with 32GB card cost me about $70 on Amazon. And it uses 1 watt of electricity.
All you need to do is set "prune=1024" and everything you need to signal for SegWit will fit on the 32GB card.
You can even do it with a 16GB card (even cheaper). Just set "prune=550".
If you use Rasbian Lite and set "prune=550" you can even run it on a 8GB card (cheaper again).
So with a $70 (or less) investment and burning 1 watt, That's really not too bad. A this point, you only need to worry about using too much bandwidth on your internet connection. But as long as you have a nice broadband connection to the internet, that shouldn't be an issue either.

This number (45%) is meaningless at the beginning of a new 2016 block (~2 weeks) period. As far as I can see, it's the same amount of miners signaling for SegWit as the last 2016 block period, which ended with ~28% for SegWit. (everything gets averaged out more towards the end of a period)
In mining, there is a "luck" factor. The SegWit miners simply got lucky at the beginning of this 2016 block period. Which shot the percentage way up. As more and more blocks get averaged into this period, their "luck" will run out and the percentage will be back to 26 to 29%.
Hopefully, in another month or two, three or more mining pools will update to SegWit and the percentage will be up to 45% at the END of a 2016 block period.
It's the END of a period that matters. In order for SegWit to activate, the percentage has to be 95% at the end of the period.
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:25:58
SegWit will allow about twice as many transaction to fit into 1 block.
So... If miner fees drop by about 50%, but there's twice as many transaction per block, then the fees per block would be about the same.
If things go like this (or close to like this) the miners will make about the same per block as they did about a year ago when blocks weren't always full and the mempool held 5 megs worth of transactions or less.
@_date: 2017-03-16 05:18:14
One other reason people are using Raspberry Pi's as a node, is the power (or lack there of).
Yes, this Newegg system is a much nicer more powerful machine, but it burns more power (electricity) too!
I'm not sure about a Pi 3, but the Pi 2 burns about 7 watts.
(the Pi 3 might burn 12 to 15?... just a guess)
I don't know what that Newegg system will burn, but I'm guessing 60 to 100 watts.... 24/7/365!!! That's a lot more than 7.
Just something to consider when picking the perfect computer to run your node.

@_date: 2017-03-22 15:57:00
Oh, ok... Thanks for clearing that up. I was beginning to wonder "Do I need a static WAN IP?"
But you still **don't** need a static WAN IP to access servers on your LAN when you're away from home. (see DDNS info below) Sometimes the ISP will give you a static IP, and sometimes they won't. Sometimes if they do, they charge extra for it.
A FREE more flexible solution would be to set up a DDNS for your WAN IP. I use [ChangeIP]( My modem/router from my ISP has settings for DDNS. So it checks my WAN IP address several times a day and updates the DDNS automatically if my WAN IP changed. Not all routers have this settings, but most newer ones do.
This allows me to access any server I'm running at home when I'm away from home, using " And then of course ":xxxxx" after the ".com" for the port number.
You'd have to open up port 22 on your router's "port forwarding" to your Pi's IP, if you want to SSH into your Pi from away from home. (I have tested this. This works.)
Sounds like you're doing to need at least 3 ports open to your Pi. 8333 for the node. 22 to SSH into the Pi. And whatever port you're using for you apache/mysql server.

SegWit (by itself) doesn't decrease fees anymore than BTU would. Or any 2mb to 4mb block limit change would.
But what SegWit adds to the formula that is different from any other block size increase is... It allows for layers like Lightening Network to be added. The Lightening Network allows for 100's of 1,000's to transactions that the miners wouldn't get paid for.
But the only way to move funds in or out of the Lightening Network is through Bitcoin, and the miners WILL get paid to do that.
Once SegWit gets activated, it could take 6 months to a year to the Lightening Network up and running. At first, VERY FEW people would use Lighting Network. It's hard enough to get new users to send and receive funds just using Bitcoin, add on top of that all the extra steps to move funds in Lighting????.... Forget about it! It might take another 6 months to a year AFTER Lightening is running for any significant amount of users start using it. I'm talking about 5 to 10% 2 years after SegWit gets approved.
Even though sending funds with the Lightening Network is very fast... It's costly and complicated. It's NOT for your average user.
But with Bitcoin moving forward with SegWit and the Lightening Network, this will bring many new users to Bitcoin. Many more average users to. Just looking to send value through the internet.... Not needing to know what Lightening Network is about, how it works, or even interested in it.
The miners against SegWit and the Lightening Network, are not looking at the big pictures. These two additions to Bitcoin will be good for Bitcoin, long term. And what's good for Bitcoin, is good for Bitcoin miners.
When SegWit gets activated, fees per block might go down a little for the first few months, but then they'll go right back up to where they were about a year ago.
And then sometime later when Lightening Network gets activated, the same thing might happen. Lower fees for a few months, then right back to normal fees again.
I'm mining Bitcoin today. And I've been mining for over 3 years. I also run a full node. My mining operation and full node are both signaling for SegWit.

The **prune =  setting is for how big you want your block chain folder to be in Megabytes.
If you **prune = 550**, it will prune to get your block chain folder down to 550 MB.
If you **prune = 1024**, it will prune less, trying to get the folder down to 1,024 MB.

The last difficulty adjustment period (~2 weeks / 2016 blocks) ended with 28.87% signaling for SegWit.

Hahaha... Yea, maybe. It could be an April Fools joke. But I don't see them going through all the trouble to switch to SegWit, just to switch back on April 2nd.
As far as I can tell, they are NOT signaling for both. Their first 19 blocks found (this period) were NOT for SegWit. The next 2 where for SegWit.
I guess maybe they might have some servers switched and others not. We'll know for sure if that number 19 changes.

As soon as the Pi gets here tomorrow I'll start setting it up.

@_date: 2017-03-30 06:45:51
No.... They stop making (and sold out of) batch 3. Now they are selling version 4. You can order one today. $39 + shipping from China.
They mine at 5.5GH/s, and are pre-configured to mine on AntPool's Solo Mode. Which means you only get paid if you find a block, which would probably be NEVER.
If you could mine on regular pool mode (at 5.5GH/s) you're going to make about $0.01 every 10 days.(at today's current BTC price of $1,037) But you can't do this since it is pre-configured to mine in solo mode.

I just checked it out. Changing the network settings in the GUI also changes the dhcpcd.conf file automatically.
In the top right of your desktop, you should see the networking icon.
[It Should Look Like This](
If you Right-Click on it [This Menu Will Pop Up.](
Click on **Wireless &amp; Wired Network Settings** and you should see [This Menu.](
Set [This Field]( to **eth0**, or **wlan0** if you're using WiFi.
Then click the **eth0** or **wlan0** again to select it.
Now in [This Window]( you can **uncheck** the **Automatically configure** box which will turn off the dynamic IP, and you can then fill in the IP addresses need to set your static IP numbers.
After I set this up in the GUI, I went to have a look at the **dhcpcd.conf** file. And [Here Is What I Saw]( at the bottom of the file.

I'm sorry to say, I don't.
I wish I had time to make one. All the tutorials I found are old (not for Pi3 or Core 0.14), or the steps didn't work the way the tutorial said they should.
I can give you the two tutorials that I used to get it working....
This one is THE BEST by far, but it's a year old. He uses a Pi2, and he downloads Core 0.12 (which is NOT signaling for SegWit, and doesn't have pruning). Do ALL the steps he does (even when he says you don't really need to do this), but when he downloads and installs 0.12, use the other tutorial to download and install 0.14 instead.
[Full Node On RP2](
Here's the other tutorial. Use this to make sure you get core 0.14, and read about the pruning.
[Run a 0.14 Full Node on RP3](
Let me know if you run into any problems. I do NOT know a lot about Linux, but I might be able to help.
My Full Node has been running GREAT for 3 days now. It's running on a Raspberry Pi 3, with a 32GB micro SD card. NO external hard drive, NO usb Flash drive!

Yes... S9's give you the most hash for your watts, but BOY!... Are they loud!!!! It's like running a ShopVac in your living room.
I just helped a friend set up an R4. He got it from ebay, so he paid more than buying it from Bitmain. They are not kidding when they say this thing is quiet! Less fan noise then S9, S7, S5, S3, or S1. This thing is VERY quiet. Great design. We set it up on a 240v A/C 2,400 watt power supply. Everything is cool and quiet, and it's mining away right on specs... 8 Terahashes per second.
The R4 is the absolute BEST home miner when it comes to low noise and Terahashes per second. IMHO
The R4 does pull about 930 watts. So if you don't have a nice sized solar panel system, be prepared for a huge electric bill.

I don't know exactly how this app works, but if it works like Airbitz it's perfectly save to use. Of course, I'd use an app like this to carry around $100 or less (typically), maybe more for a specific purchase on a specific day.
The Airbitz app encrypts your keys and then sends them to Airbitz for storage. Even Airbitz can't see your keys. The only thing that can decrypt your keys, is your account password (which is stored on your phone, encrypted). Hopefully a LONG password (12 characters or more). The Airbitz app ONLY uses the Airbitz servers for password management and account creation. It uses the blockchain to transfer bitcoins. So... If Airbitz ever goes out of business, you can't restore you wallet, you can't change your password, you can't create a new account. But you CAN transfer your bitcoin to a different wallet.

You shouldn't say "there will always be at least 25% of hardcore opponents". Things change. People change. Situations change.
The BIG THREE pools could simply change their minds (However unlikely, they could.). Or, the Core Devs could come out with an upgrade that might help some or all of them change their mines.

To make the math simple, lets say 1 bitcoin is worth $1,000.
You have $10,000 to invest in Bitcoin.
You could buy 10 bitcoins and you're done.
Or.... You could buy $6,000 worth of mining hardware and set aside $4,000 to pay for electricity.
If you can find a good deal on the hardware, AND, have a cost of 4 cents (or less) per kwh of electricity, you just might be able to mine 10.5 or 11 bitcoins with that same $10,000.
This would be EXTREMELY hard to do, and you probably don't have access to 4 cents per kwh of electricity. So for most people (the vast majority of people) it's better to just buy bitcoin and be done with it.
I have a very unique situation, so I can actually mine more bitcoin then I spend on hardware and electricity. No.... I'm not stealing it. I'm getting it from a guy with a massive solar array.

63.16% of the miners on Slush's Pool either haven't voted at all, or voted "Don't Care". So what I believe is..... Too many miners either don't have the time to research the issue, or they are too lazy to sign up in a pool that supports SegWit.
I'm only trying to say, if you support SegWit stop being lazy and mine at a pool that supports it. If you don't understand the issue, try to find some time to do a little research cast your vote.
It is a little unsettling to know that 63.16% of miners are too busy or too lazy to do a little research and have an opinion. I would think that miners would be (should be) a little more involved in the process.
I can understand 63% of wallet holders not really knowing what's going. But 63% of miners??? Come on.

I don't think it will be happening, soon. But it has until Oct 2017 to reach 95%.
Some pools are still in the process of upgrading to 0.13.1 (or 0.13.2). This is one of the more complicated upgrades, so it can take some time. There are still several pools that are planning to switch but haven't yet, and others want to switch but are waiting to see how things go. It's the last 5 or 6 that could hold SegWit up.
It's not looking quite so bad right now. If we are less than 35% by this summer, that will be looking pretty bad for SegWit.

Whether you're mining Bitcoin or a shitcoin, it's short sighted to not care about the coin you're mining. If you're mining a shitcoin, you need to know what's going on with it so you can be prepared to point your hardware at a different shitcoin when the time comes. And if you're mining a more legitimate coin (as you put it), you need to know what's going on so you make sure you're doing what's best for that coin. Because what's best for that coin is what's best for you.

Oh..... So you're going to test me now.
1) The signature proves you have the private key to the address, without showing your private key. Of course, a paper wallet can't do this. It has to send the private key. That's why you should only send from a paper wallet ONCE, and the full amount.
2) I NEVER SAID you can fit 2megs of DATA into 1meg. If I did, I miss spoke. I said SegWit allows you to fit up to 2megs of transactions (~3,500 to 4,000 transactions) into a 1meg block (typically holds 2,000 transactions)(that's a 1.5 to 2 times increase)
3) They way you first talked about the 75% discount was as if it was written into the code, a sure thing, forever. (I'm sorry, I don't remember your exact verbage, and don't have time to go looking for it at the moment.) What I said was.... Sure, the fee MIGHT drop 75% for a while, but once volume picks up and blocks start filling up again, the fees per transaction will rise up again, only this time there will be up to TWICE as many transactions per block! GREAT for miners!!!

Is this feasible?

There are still other costs. There's the cost of the hardware (the S9). And where do you live? Canada? I live in Southern California. In the summer these things can REALLY heat up a house. Before I moved my miners out, my A/C ran about twice as much trying to keep the house cool.
If you live somewhere with hot summers, your basement is going to get really HOT. Heat like to rise. I'm sure it will find it's way into your house making you run your A/C more.
I don't know.... Maybe you live pretty far north and your summers are too hot. It gets to be pretty close to HELL around where I live.
Also... I'm sorry... I have too many numbers in my head. I know you said you have an S9, but I was thinking you had an S7.
But you also have to remember... The difficulty keeps going UP and in ~3 years the block reward will be cut in half again.
You need to figure how much you paid for your S9, + mining electricity costs, + cooling electricity costs, over the next few years. Then compare that number to buying that much worth of bitcoin right now.
With your S9, 14.5 cents a kwh, and 20kw solar array, you'll probably end up head of the game.
But you also need to include the cost of the solar array. That's like buying electricity ahead of time. My guy's solar array was bought and paid for years ago. It already paid for itself, so now the electricity is free.

I don't know why more people aren't using Bitsquare. It's the best way I've ever seen to trade P2P online.
The seller puts up the bitcoin for sale, a good faith deposit, a small miner fee and small fee that goes to Bitsquare. The buyer puts up a good faith deposit, small miner fee and small fee that goes to Bitsquare. ALL of this is held in escrow by the Bitsquare software.
The good faith deposits are refunded to the users when all goes well. This is the incentive to "play nice". When using the "quick pay" type of transaction, the buyer sends the cash to the seller. NO BANK ACCOUNT info is sent. Only the name on the account, the cash, and the Bitsquare transaction ID goes into the memo field.
These "quick pay" transactions are non-reversible. As long as everything goes well, both parties get their deposits back and the buyer receives the bitcoin.
If for some reason the seller doesn't release the bitcoins to the buyer, the transaction times out in 3 or 4 days and it goes to arbitration. The buyer proves he sent the fund with a digitally signed statement from the bank, and he will win his case. The buyer will get his bitcoin owed to him and his deposit back, but the seller will NOT get his deposit back... Punishment for not sending the bitcoin in the time allotted.
I have had several successful transactions on Bitsquare. Everything worked GREAT!
I had one transaction fail. If failed because the offer to sell was created on a old version of Bitsquare what wasn't compatible with the current version. And I lost my deposit. I reported what happen to the Bitsquare people, and they REFUNDED the deposit. They are working on fixing the issue (which is very rare).
The Bitsquare P2P system is still in it's early stages, but works great almost all the time. When it doesn't work right, they will refund lost bitcoins.
Bitsquare currently has a 1 bitcoin per transaction limit until they work out a couple more bugs. Hopefully, with the next version update (or two) the limit will be changed to 2, or no limit at all.
I suggest downloading and installing the Bitsquare software now. Try 2 or 3 small transaction so you can see how it all works first hand. When the software is perfected and the 1 bitcoin limit lifted, you'll be familiar with the system and ready for some more serious trading.

Much better comment. Thank you.
I still don't like the idea that miners can mine empty blocks when the mempool has a backlog of 5, 10, 30, 60megs! (The mempool as displayed on [TradeBlock Live](
A couple months ago I saw the mempool backed up over 80megs, and empty blocks being mined. This is simply ridiculous, and an obvious attempt to jack up fees, and to make claims that Bitcoin is broken without much bigger blocks.
I guess SegWit going live an a couple of days should help. Within a few weeks (hopefully) most transactions will be SegWit transactions and we will have blocks closer to 2megs, making it harder keep the mempool full with spam transactions and mining empty blocks won't be such a good way to raise transaction fees.
What I'm really looking forward to is Schnorr Signatures later this year, giving us over 3megs per block. This should make it even harder to justify spamming and mining empty blocks.
I don't want to see miners as the enemy. Miners should be and are a much needed and vital attribute of the Bitcoin ecosystem. But when their actions appear to be attacking the system, what's wrong with taking action to give miners extra incentives to doing their job.... Like, fill each block with as many transactions as possible or your block will be rejected.  
There has to be a way to do this. Before SegWit, increasing the blocksize was impossible without a hard fork. Then the genius Core Devs came up with SegWit, a soft fork.
If they can take the impossible and make it possible, there has to be a way to get the miners to simply mine blocks filled with as many transactions as possible.
Or maybe SegWit + Schnorr Signatures will fix this too. A 3meg+ blocksize will make spamming and empty blocks a very bad idea. At least for a few years until there is World Wide Mass Adoption of Bitcoin, and we'll have another scaling debate.

VERY bad analogy! What you fail to realize, is the second car doesn't have to propagate through the network to all the miners like the first car. The second car can simply be hashed and stored on the nodes.
And there is no "centrally planned 75% fee discount"!!!!! It MIGHT be estimated that fee MIGHT drop 75% at first, but once blocks start filling up again (should take long) the fees will for right back up to where they are now, only this time there will be TWICE as many of them in the same 1meg block.
You really need to do more research. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:50:29
How about this?
In about 91 years Bitcoin will be 100 years old. At that time, any coins that haven't moved in the past 90 years will be deemed lost. Whatever this amount of coins is, it will be added to the block reward spread out over a 10 year period. At the end of this 10 year period Bitcoin will be 110 years old and the cycle will repeat (excluding the coins deemed lost 100 years ago).
At some point, something has to be done. People will always refuse to backup, hardware will always break down, and people will always die taking passwords to the grave with them. Not to mention coins lost in fires, floods, and other natural disasters. If extra coins aren't added to the system, eventually ALL coins will be lost.
The above proposal will make sure there will always be close to 21 million coins in circulation after the year 2140.

OK Musty. But I don't believe Core has deemed the agreement "null 'n void". They think that a hard fork is not a good idea "right now". They believe BIGGER blocks NEED to happen... Just not right now, and right now, SegWit is the best solution.
Supporting SegWit is NOT "giving Core everything they want on a silver platter"..... By that logic... Giving the Big Blockers, bigger blocks, is giving them everything they what. Supporting SegWit is supporting the best option for right now. Core believes bigger blocks are coming, but right now it's best to "stuff twice as many transactions into the same block size." The result... A 2meg block size for only a 1meg block.
If we can stuff 2megs into a 1meg block size, just think about when we do get 2meg blocks!!!!! Then we'll be putting FOUR megs worth of transactions into a 2meg block size. Or, how about we look farther down the road... When we have a 16meg block size, we can fit 32megs of transactions into that 16meg block!!!!
When you think about it, SegWit gives to BOTH sides of the debate. It keeps the block size at 1meg, while fitting 2megs of transactions into that 1meg block. AND, it DOUBLES the size of ANY future block size increase down the road.

That does suck. They are not supposed to open a dispute until the time (4 days) has passed. If they do, THEY are supposed to lose the deposit (dispute fee). You didn't do anything wrong, you should NOT have lose your deposit (dispute fee), only the bitcoin transaction (miner) fee.

I'm not really sure about what Slush's Pool is doing. On the linked page (at the top of this thread) it looks like ~1/3 of Slush is not ready for SegWit, and ~2/3 is YES for SegWit.
I do have a Slush's account, but I don't see where you can vote for SegWit. I see where you can vote for Core, Classic, or Unlimited, and others, but not SegWit. Is voting for Core a vote for SegWit?... It's not really clear.
And if you look at the voting results, 44.32% is the LARGEST amount with a vote of "Don't Care". Followed by "Bitcoin Core" with 38.18%. And then there's 18.84% who haven't even voted at all.
So if you add up the "Not Voted" with the "Don't Care" you get 63.16%!!!!
The "Don't Care" get work assigned to them decided by the pool's AI.
The "Not Vote" get work from all the different proposals.
Come on MINERS!!!!! Find some time to do a little research and vote for SOMETHING!

It looks like your miner fee is a little low, but not bad. Also, the two address funding this transaction are unconfirmed, but they also have OK fees (not great, but OK).
The mempool is backed up pretty good right now. It's backed up over 28megs. Backed up this much I would have attacted a 0.0008 or 0.0009 miner's fee. But your 0.0005 should be OK.
Be patient. I bet this transaction goes through within a few more hours.... 1 or 2 days, tops!
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:43:20
Yes. If the bitcoin was in a paper wallet at the time of the split, it's in the same address on BOTH chains.
1) Use Mycelium to move all of the BTC to a new paper wallet or some other BTC wallet. (do this 1st to make sure your BTC is safe)
2) Then you can move the BCH from that paper wallet with Coinomi set to BCH, or Electron Cash (you might have to change the network to BCH). (*This shows how LAME the people are in BCH. They took the Electrum wallet and made changes to it to work with the BCH chain and changed the name to ElectronCash, but left the default network set to the BTC network!!!*)
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:11:07
Yes. That's where I got my numbers.
And if you throw out the "Not Voted" and the "Don't Care", and then compare the Core vote against all the rest, you get Core at 57%! That seems to be a little closer to where we should be with all the pools right now. But instead, we're at 26%.
Probably because the 3 big Chinese pools are so damn BIG. I know they have a lot of their own hardware mining there, but the other people mining there who support SegWit need to switch pools. And the ones who are like the "Don't Care" or "Not Voted" need to wake up, research the issue, and switch pools if they support SegWit.
Just like on Slush's Pool.... ~35% of the miners are listed as "Don't Care" or "Not Voted". Wow!!!! 35%!!! These are the miners I'm calling too busy, too lazy, and I can probably throw in there, uninformed.
This 35% of miners are the miners who this post was originally directed to. These guys need to cast their vote.
@_date: 2017-01-16 13:43:19
In general, I'd have to say no. 10% is normally on the high side and typically there are offers much closer to 0%.
This was the case for Bitsquare last month, but not the past 10 days or so.
In early January we had a nice price rise to over $1,100, and then drop to $755. For the last couple of day, it's been around the $820's.
So I think a lot of the people who are willing to sell their bitcoin feel it's value is closer to $1,000. So they are offering to sell their bitcoin for 10 to 12%.
Before this major price drop, there were people offering to sell their bitcoin for 4,3,2, or even 1 or 0% (when the price was $1,120+ on Jan 4th).
I'm pretty sure the high percentage they are asking now is only because of the recent $300 price drop since Jan 4th. And when the price finds it's way back up to around $1,000, you start to see Buy Offers with a much more reasonable percentage.
Look at the "Sell BTC" offers on Bitsquare right now. They range from -1% to +1%. This is much closer to how the "Buy BTC" offers looks a couple of weeks ago.

You really don't understand the BASICS of SegWit. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF SegWit! To "segregate" OUT of the block, data not needed (with SegWit) to validate the transactions.
Do you really think that the Core Devs would have spent so much time writing this software, then tested it for longer than anything else they've ever tested, then put it up for a vote, when it doesn't to THE MAIN THING IT WAS MEANT TO DO? It allows for 1.5 to 2megs worth of transactions to fit into a 1meg block, by "segregating" out some of the data.
I counter point what I want to counter point. The fact that I don't counter point one point, doesn't mean you're right. It means I didn't have the time or the need to do it. If you made the point that 2+2=5. I don't have to counter point that.... Everyone can see that you don't know how to add.

Yes.... I did some research and "EDITED" my original post.
At least I'm safe since I'm the one who sent the cash and the bitcoin transactions can't be reversed.
I guess if I'm ever going to sell bitcoin on this service, I'm going to have to use a service that can't be reversed, like "Cash Deposit Into My Bank Account". But then I'll have to give up my real name and account number. If I open a new account just for this, and keep a very small balance in it, I should be relatively safe.
There are other ways to transfer the cash. ClearXchange seems to be the most used way. With Cash Deposit Into My Account is second. I also see US Money Order. But that would suck waiting for that to come in the mail.
Hopefully there will be some new method of sending cash in the US that isn't at risk of chargebacks. Hmmmm.... I'm not holding my breath.

And others are simply too busy. They have their day job to worry about. They have college to attend or a family to look after. We all have pretty busy lives these days.

Ummmm..... I didn't "shout out" for protocol changes. I "shouted out" for miners to do their job!!!
How about you go read my post.... Even at the end I ASKED... "Is this feasible?"
And yes, I know that all nodes won't have the exact same mempool when a block is found. But won't they be similar? Similar enough to have the "more than 20% smaller" rule? If not, ok, no more than 30% smaller, or even 40% if we need to go that big on the percentage. ANYTHING besides an empty block would be nice.
There has to be some way to make sure the miners are doing their job... Mining blocks with the most amount of transactions as possible.
They're supposed to WANT to put as many transactions in a block as possible because they will make more money when they do. But when they start mining empty blocks as an attack on the network, there has to be a way to force them to do their job.

On Jan 24, 2017, 3:45am (Pacific Time) the mempool was hit with 15.48 transactions per second. The transaction burst didn't last long, maybe about 3 minutes.
I don't look at the mempool very often, but this is the biggest spike I've ever seen.

I don't know. I'm just trying to light a fire under the miners who believe in SegWit, but are too lazy to switch to a pool that is voting for it.
Of course I considered that SegWit might not ever make 95%.
And, I was very surprised to see that 63.16% of the miners in Slush's Pool either haven't voted, or voted "Don't Care". Wow!!!! Come on people.... Do a little research and vote for SOMETHING!!!!
Do I understand EVERYTHING about Bitcoin and SegWit, NO! But I think I have a pretty good basic understanding about both of them. And right now, I feel SegWit is the best thing for Bitcoin.
I'm sure the Core Devs are A HELL of a lot smarting them me, and they think (right now) SegWit is the best thing for Bitcoin.
I have a lot of respect for Andreas Antonopouls and he thinks SegWit is the best thing for Bitcoin right now.
I also have a lot of respect for Tone Vays. He thinks SegWit is the best thing for Bitcoin right now.
I'm sorry Roger Ver. I never really liked him from went I first started learning about him back in 2013 (when I first started learning about Bitcoin). Too many of the things he says just don't make sense to me. He doesn't seem to really understand what he's talking about.
Andreas knows what he's talking about. Tone Vays knows what he's talking about.

I don't think .1BTC looks all that bad. Maybe 0.1BTC would look better. People not really into Bitcoin will see .1BTC and not really notice the "." and think "1"BTC. The "0" in front might makes the "." stand out more.
I think the .1BTC was a good place to start. From there maybe print some .25BTC, then .50BTC, then .75BTC.
It's too bad the public address and private key can't be pre-printed. But then people would have to trust that someone in your company, or at the print shop, didn't peek at that private key.

What's with "Miners can mine any size block they want, as long as they don't go over the max."???
They are paid to do a job.... **How about THEY DO IT!!!**
**Hey Core Devs,** How about adding this rule to 0.15.1... Nodes will reject blocks that are more than 20% smaller than the size of the mempool at the time the last block was mined.
Is this feasible?
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:16:51
Yes, this is true. And If Oct 2017 comes and goes with getting to 95%, the Core Devs could just put it up for vote again for ANOTHER year.
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:03:01
I would recommend p2sh (pay to script hash). This will give you SegWit addresses that start with a "3". All Bitcoin wallet are able to send to an address that starts with a "3".
The bech32 addresses start with a "bc1" and some wallets won't be able to send to your wallet if you're using bech32. It's not that the Bitcoin Network won't allow it... It's just that the old wallet doesn't recognize the bech32 address as a valid address.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:04:49
Yes... It's the best way forward. Of course there are other proposals. I never said it's the only way forward. It's the best way forward.
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:03:53
OK, let me see if I can put this another way....
Before SegWit, a 1meg block can hold about 2,000 transactions.
If Segwit gets activated, a 1meg block will be able to hold about 3,500 to 4,000 transactions. This block is what's needed to propagate throughout the network to all the miners.
The advantage of this is:
It allows the network to process up to twice at many transactions in the same 1meg block, keeping latency down and orphaned blocks to a minimum.
With the current speed of the internet, 2meg blocks could create more orphaned blocks and an unfair advantage to the winner of the last block, as he would start mining the new block while it's still propagating to the rest of the miners.
The internet is being upgraded all the time. New fiber-optic line and other hardware is being installed daily.
The Core Devs do NOT want 1meg blocks FOREVER. They want to put it off as long as they can so that when it does happen, the internet will be fast enough to keep latency issues like unfair advantages and orphaned blocks to a minimum.
It would much safer to switch to a bigger block in Dec 2017, than Jan 2017. Not that it can't be done... It'd just be safer and cause less latency issues. WHEN will the Core Devs think it's a good time to switch???? I have no idea. Summer of 2017? Q4 2017? Q2 2018? I don't know, but it will be better then, than now.
Not only does SegWit increase the number of transactions per block, it also lays the foundation for adding layers on top of Bitcoin like Lightening Network. Could something like Lightening Network be done without SegWit? Sure. But SegWit will make it much easier to do. Who knows what network layers might get added with SegWit active.
I see your point with Paper Wallets. Like..... If I had a Paper Wallet and scanned the private key with my cell phone running Mycelium, Mycelium would now have the private key and could sign the transaction FOR the Paper Wallet. Yes, I can see that. But I've never heard of this being done. I would have to know that Mycelium has this feature, and then I'd have to trust that Mycelium is handling it properly. BUT, my point was that THE PAPER WALLET couldn't sign the transaction. And the last time I did this, I received a warning from the software... "Be sure to transfer the total balance, and never use this paper wallet again."

In the FAQ's for ClearXchange it says....
Q: Can I cancel a payment?
A: No, unfortunately once a payment is initiated, you cannot cancel the payment.
Well..... I guess this might be different than "reversing a payment". But just because a payment "can" be reversed, doesn't mean the payment is "easily reversed". They'd have to convince their bank that they didn't get what they wanted for the money. But there is proof in the Bitsquare system that what they wanted WAS sent to them.
So I don't know..... They'd have a tough case to prove.
This should probably get all straightened out BEFORE the 1 BTC limit is lifted, and much large sums are exchanged.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:50:39
You're right, it doesn't currently work this way. This is simply a proposal (off the top of my head, without much thought) to try and fix the "lost Bitcoins" issue. At some point, **many** decades in the future, this will become an issue. Kind of like the scaling debate is now. Something will have to be done at that point, or the amount of Bitcoin in circulation will keep dropping until there's less than 1 Bitcoin left. Now I'm talking **centuries** into the future.
In my proposal, no change to the Bitcoin protocol is needed until 91 years from now. This means I don't need to worry about it much. I'm sure I'll be "6 feet under" long before then.

@_date: 2017-01-27 17:21:59
Yes... My fist couple of buys were pretty small just to check it out and see firsthand how it all worked.
As far as the percentage goes..... I've seen offers as high as 12% over current price. (When bitcoin went way down to $775.) But I think that was just because the price dropped so much, so quick.
BUT.... Look as my last two buys {[Trade History]( then go check the price of bitcoin on then those days (I typically use Bitstamp). Those two buys were UNDER the current price! And the current price was low compare to what it was just 2 weeks before. SCORE!!!
...So good deals are out there on the Bitsquare system.
But even 5 to 8% isn't too bad considering it's P2P, NON-reversible cash transfer(my understanding), no KYC/AML regulations, and you don't even have to leave your house or put pants on.
EDIT: The "NON-reversible" cash transfer is in question. On ClearXchange's website, it says "Once a payment is sent, it can NOT be cancelled." I guess this is not really clear if it can be "reversed" 1 or 2 months down the road.
EDIT  I just got off the phone with ClearXchange. They basically said... Depending on the bank from which the payment was sent, it's possible that the payment could be reversed.
EDIT  I've been in contact with Bitsquare. They said the guy I talked with at ClearXchange might not have given me correct information, and that so far Bitsquare has not had ANYONE complain that someone did a chargeback after sending funds with ClearXchange. So hopefully, this is because it's very hard to do or it can't be done.
I still love Bitsquare. There are other ways of receiving funds like direct deposit into the bank account or sending a money order through the mail. When you make a cash deposit, you have to write "NO REFUND" on the receipt and the rip the receipt in half then take a picture of it and send it to the seller. I'm not sure how it works with sending a money order.

Wow! Less than $500 after The Halving... A major percentage of the community would be fearful at that price. But with a dip from $745 to $685, I'd have to say SOME are fearful. (mostly newbe's) But yes... It's only a 8.054% dip. I wouldn't say the sky is falling.
Now it just went from $685 to $693. Is this little dip over, or will it turn around and head lower again? Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:11:24
Yes is is. With SegWit some of the transaction data that's not really needed in the block is "segregated" (separated) from the block. As a result, you can fit about 3,500 to 4,000 transaction into 1 block. Right now, only about 2,000 transaction can fit into a block. So with SegWit, you're basically getting about 2megs of transaction into the same 1meg block.
As far as "backing out" of the upgrade... Pretty much all of the upgrades would be impossible to back out of. This is nothing new. Besides.... Why would you want to back out of 4,000 transaction per block and go back to 2,000 transactions per block?
As a mining, I would WELCOME 4,000 transaction fees per block, instead of only 2,000. Sure, at first the fees per transaction might drop a bit, but soon blocks will be full again and fees back UP, but this time there will be 4,000 higher fees instead of only 2,000. Good for Bitcoin. Good for miners!
I heard an interview with one of the Core Devs (sorry, I can't remember his name) and he said this vulnerability of miners spending outputs is simply not true. That can't happen.
If you don't understand how SegWit will allow about twice as many transactions per block, I believe it's YOU who needs to do more research.

Maybe Eligius supports SegWit, but hasn't got around to switching yet. And that's fine. But....
If you're mining on Eligius, you should still switch to a pool that does support SegWit. Then, send Eligius an email telling them why you switched, and that you'll switch back when they start supporting SegWit.

Coinbase use to charge only 1% when buying or selling bitcoin. Now they charge 1.5%.
But they don't charge the whole 1.5% at the same time. They add .5% to their current price (if you're buying) and then charge a 1% fee on top of that. And of course they take .5% off the price if you're selling to them, then another 1% fee.
Either way, in the end, you're paying a 1.5% fee from their base price, on every transaction.

12 hours and no response? No one knows how Mycelium calculates it's mining fee???
Anyone here from Mycelium?
And one more question about this would be...
Why are the Low-pri and Ecomonic fees the same?
Having Low-pri and Economic the same doesn't make much sense. A ~10 cent spread between each of the four levels would seem like better options.
Low-pri = .13, Economic = .23, Normal = .33, Priority = .43, would be reasonable if the mempool was backed up 5 to 15 megs.
But with less then 2 megs in the mempool, I'm thinking a 5 cent spread might be pretty good....
Low-pri = .05, Economic = .10, Normal = .15, Priority = .20
@_date: 2016-11-10 23:40:33
First of all... You should be contacting coinbase about this. I know their response times are not the quickest, but you need to get that ball rolling.
Next... I know a lot of people don't like coinbase. My experience with them is not all that bad, at least when it comes to the purchase of bitcoins.
Coinbase's BTC price usually seems to be a bit on the high side, but that's ok. Then they charge a 1.5% fee on all transactions (it used to be 1%) when connected to a bank account (which you seem to have a problem doing). If you connect to a bank debit card, their fee goes up to 3.99%.
My main issue with coinbase is there AML/KYC rules. Wow!!!! Do they POUR on the AML/KYC bullsh!t. They want to know your, home address, DL, SS employer, the position you hold at work!!! Wow!!!! TMI!!!!
Name, address, and banking info is all they should need. THE BANK ALREADY holds my DL and SS No other info should be required. Once I prove I'm the owner of the bank account, with the deposit verifications (I had no issues with that process), that should be good enough.
Back to your verification issue. I'm guessing it's a glitch in their system. Also, check with your bank to make sure they "play nice" with coinbase. My main bank banned me from transacting with coinbase. They told me "If we see one more transaction from coinbase we will close your account." So I had to open an account at different bank just to connect to coinbase.

With the ClearXchange system, sometimes the payment is INSTANT, and sometime it takes 1 to 3 days to be finalized. I don't know what makes it one or the other.
Either way, the receiving person sees it instantly in there account, but it might be marked as "pending" for 1 to 3 days. Sometimes they feel the need to wait 1 to 3 days, but most of the time (in my experience) they release the bitcoins pretty quick. Usually hours, to two days. I had one guy go ALL THE WAY to 1 hour before the 3 days was up. But I got the bitcoin I was due, it worked perfectly.
I didn't NEED the bitcoin right away, so I didn't care waiting.

It's good to see the nodes updating, but it doesn't matter for 0.13.1 activation, right?
My understanding is... It all has to do with the mining. 
When 95% of the blocks are mined with 0.13.1, then 0.13.1 gets "locked" in. Then, 2016 blocks later (about 2 weeks) 0.13.1 goes LIVE!!!
Once it goes live, miners who are not using 0.13.1 are taking a risk of NOT getting the block reward if they haven't switched to 0.13.1.

Paper will last a lot longer if you laminate it.
Write your seed words down TWICE on two strips of paper. Cover BOTH sides of the strips with clear packing tape. Cut of excess tape.
Now you have TWO copies of your seed words laminated to keep air and moisture out to greatly reduce the yellowing of the paper and the fading of the ink. (I do this all the time with paper wallets printed with a COLD computer and COLD printer.)
Now what do you do with the two copies???
Copy 1: Keep at your house in a REALLY good hiding place or a safe bolted to the floor.
Copy 2: Keep at your parents' house (or very good friend) in a REALLY good hiding place or a safe bolted to the floor. Or, in a safe deposit box at the bank... Hey... Banks are good for something. LOL!!!
Why two copies?... If you store only one copy at your house and your house burns down, your Bitcoins are GONE! Even if the safe is "fire resistant" or even "fire proof" the fire can get hot enough to damage paper inside the safe or melt the tape you used to laminate your seed words.
Although it's better to have two backup in case of fire, with two backups at two different locations they are TWICE as likely to be stolen if there's a break in. Well.... No method is 100%. You can only do the best you can do, and try to think of everything.

I haven't really followed him all that closely. I have heard him make predictions about the weather, earthquakes, and volcanoes erupting, but his timeline for these events are anywhere from later this year to 10 or 20 years in the future. So it's kind of hard to know if he's right or wrong without waiting 10 or 20 years.
Yet.... I HAVE NEVER heard anyone else make such specific predictions about the price of Bitcoin, 6 months ahead of time, and be right 50% of the time. But then, if it wasn't for the Bitfinex hack, I feel there's a really good chance he would have been right about it being $888 in Oct and $1,000 to $1,200 by the end of 2016. So, if it wasn't for the Bitfinex hack, there's a really good chance he would have been right all 4 times of those times. Did he make other predictions about Bitcoin besides these 4 and the $14,000 price in mid 2017?..... Not that I know of.
I still think there might be something to his WebBot program. The guy personally..... He's A NUT JOB!!!! He believes in ChemTrails!!!! Hahahaha!!!.... There are no ChemTrails. They are con-trails.

Maybe you could enlighten me and give me a better reason for AntPool to mine 4 empty (or near empty) blocks in the past 7 hours, when the mempool was backed up 15megs or more.
Yes, I know of another reason to mine empty blocks. But the amount of empty blocks mined by some pools is not in proportion with their about of hashing power to be for that reason. It is more likely they are doing it to backlog the mempool farther, to jack up transaction fees.

The Dev's (the developers who write the code) want SegWit upgrade to be accepted by an overwhelming majority so that there's no question it's the right way to go.
It would be hard for the remaining 5% to say "We are right, and the 95% are wrong."
If the Dev's set a simple majority (51%) goal, then the remaining 49% could say "Let's take this 49% and start our own coin (Bitcoin Original) without the SegWit upgrade." And that would pretty much split Bitcoin into two almost equal halves. 
I believe the Dev's are right in going with the overwhelming majority. But I think they could gone with a little lower percentage. I think 90% could have done the trick just fine.

When he does move them, nothing says he has to move them all at one time. He could give 100,000 to each of his kids (who knows how many kids he has). He could sell 1,000 when bitcoin = $10,000, and he could sell 10,000 when bitcoin = $50,000.... Who knows?!?!?

"that would require them to ditch their holding"??? I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Lets say I have 30 bitcoins. But I don't like the way Bitcoin is going and I start to like XYZcoin better. I could use shapeshift dot com to convert all (or some) of my bitcoins into XYZcoin and basically move my holding (my trust in Bitcoin) to a different coin.
Or, I could get out of crypto-coins altogether! Cashing out of bitcoin back into my local government currency (fiat).
The developers must write the best code for the miners and users. And the miners must choose to run the best code for them and the users. Because they BOTH know... If the users aren't happy, they can always cash out back into fiat, or a different crypto-currency.
And yes.... With a hard-fork (early we were talking about soft-forks) a user could choose to use a different blockchain of the SAME coin. This is why hard-forks are so dangerous. They can divide the community in the short term. But in the long term, the BEST blockchain will win.

GREAT read! Thank you.
I own a Ledger Nano (not the model S), and I love it.
The only difficult thing about it is that it's very important to set it up on a cold computer, booting from the Ledger Live OS. Finding the ISO file to download from Ledger isn't easy. Then writing that ISO file to a USB Flash Drive (you just can't simply copy it there) might be hard for some people. I've been doing this sort of thing for decades, so it was easy for me. If you don't do this to set it up, YOU'RE EXPOSING YOUR WALLET WORDS if you have a key-logger or screen-logger virus on your computer.
There has got to be TONS of people out there who set their Nano up without taking this extra step. I wouldn't store 1 bitcoin on those devices. I'd feel safe storing 100,000 bitcoins on my Nano.
Now I just need to find someone who will give me 100,000 bitcoins.

No. I added to my collection at $695, then again at $688. Just small amounts. No big deal.
If I thought this post would have influenced the price in the slightest, I would have NEVER posted it and waited for the price to go down to $600 to then buy much bigger amounts. Which I will do if gets that low today, this week, or whenever.
This post was just a friendly reminder that dips (big and small) happen. Don't freak out. Buy small on small dip. Buy big on big dips. But it has to be YOU who decides how big or small the dip is, and how much to buy.
When I posted this, the price was just under $700 on Bitstamp. Just 3 days earlier it was $745. When I posted, I had no idea if the price was going to start turning around, or continue to drop to $550. So this post was more of a "Hey, pay attention. This could turn into a small or large dip. Don't freak. Buy The Dip."
As it turned out, the price bounced off of $685 to climb back up to $700. Now it's hovering around there. What will it do next?... Will it claim all the way back up to $745, or turn again and head back down to $600??? I have no idea.
But what I do know is this is a good time to sit up and pay attention. If it dips, it could be a quick dip, and you'll need to take action fast. Or it could go down to $550 and sit there for a week.

Try Bitsquare. It's a person2person transaction, but you never have to leave your house.
You do need A LITTLE bitcoin to start off. Enough for the mining fee (0.0001 BTC / not refunded), and for a deposit (0.02 BTC / refunded back to you).
So if you have zero bitcoin, use Local Bitcoins just to buy 0.1 BTC. That's only $100 worth, which is low risk. Just tell the guy "Here's my money (show him), I won't hand it to you until you transfer the bitcoin to me AND there is 1 confirmation."
Then use that BTC for fees and deposits on Bitsquare.

You would probably be mining in a mining pool. The pool will handle it for you. Just stay connected to the pool, and keep mining. 
If you support SegWit, make sure you're mining in a pool that supports Segwit, like Slush's Pool.
Slush's Pool has already mined 39 blocks with SegWit, but I don't think ALL of their pool servers have switch yet. From what I understand, they are working on switching all of them.

Bitcoinity dot org is still showing AntPool with ZERO "yes" votes for SegWit.
The AntPool Pool supports bigger blocks. They won't support SegWit until the Bitcoin Core Devs release a version with bigger blocks.

When it comes to soft-forks, yes, the miners have most of the power as to whether the new version becomes active or not. But in a way.... It's really the USERS!!!
The developers (software programmers) must make changes that are "good for the Bitcoin network". Or at least, changes that the MINERS see as good for the network. If the miners don't think it's good for the network, they won't run the new version. If they don't run the new version, the new version will never activate.
Now.... The miners run the version they think is best, AND what they think the "users" (wallet holders) will like. If the users don't like that version, they can switch to wallets on a different blockchain. If there are no active users on the blockchain you're mining, then your mining efforts are WORTHLESS.
So you see... It's really the USERS who are in control. The USERS use the blockchain they think is best. The MINERS mine the best blockchain with the most users and the best value. The DEVELOPERS develop the best software for the miners and users.
The whole network is an amazing system, with built-in checks and balances.

Good use of 2 cameras. Adds a bit of professionalism to the video. But your audio level was too low and sounded a bit muddy. (Maybe your mic was hiding in your robe.) The guest's audio was much better. Good level, crisp and clear.
I like your set. Plain, simple, yet functional and pleasing. But come on!!!! Robe and slippers?!?!?!?! Were you going for "My friend came over early in the morning to talk Bitcoin before I dressed." look, or, are the robe and slippers going to be "your thing" in all of your videos? Yes... You're cool.

In a robe and slippers, you come off as some spoiled brat millennial, who borrowed money for college but doesn't want to pay it back, who sleeps 'til noon and refuses to work at a lesser job because it isn't good enough for his liberal arts degree, so he still lives at home with mommy and daddy.
I'm not saying you are that person. But dressed like that, someone (not me) might assume you're that person. (Unless you do more videos dressed the same, making it "your thing.")

It may be used quite a bit, but I wouldn't say it is over used.
Let's look at an even older and more used saying.... "Buy low, sell high." Which basically means the same thing. Yet people just love to buy when the price is high and they shy away when it's low.
I repeat this old saying and Buffett's quote all the time. But people just don't seem to get it.
Even though this is a more "normal" drop, it's still a good time to add a little if you have some extra cash around.
Is this drop as good as when Bitfinex got hacked?.... No. But it's still a nice little drop. Buy some BTC if you can.
If it drops $30 or $40 more.... Buy some more!
Whether you're a long term investor, a speculator, or you use BTC as a currency, you should always remember to...
Buy the dip!
Buy a little on a little dip, buy big on a big dip.
Maybe this isn't a GREAT time to buy, but it's still a good time.

I disagree. Miners have more to think about than just mining fees.
Miners also have to consider what's best for the network and the end user (wallet holders). If the miners don't do what's best for the end users, the users can trade their bitcoins in for some other cryptocurrency. It would be VERY BAD for bitcoin miners if bitcoin users started switching to other cryptos. Miners would be better off to take a small hit on mining fees per transactions, in exchange for more transactions per block (via SegWit and/or bigger blocks), equaling out to about the same fees (or more) per block.
If you were a miner.... Would you rather mine blocks with 2,000 transactions and an average of $0.08 fee per transaction, or blocks with 4,000 transactions and an average of $0.05 fee per transaction?
If Segwit becomes active, that will open the door for the Lightning Network. If the Lightning Network becomes active, the maximum transactions per second will go from 14 (with SegWit) to 100,000 (with LN). And in 5 to 10 years, maybe the network will be processing 50,000 transactions per second. I'm not sure how that will translate to "transactions per block", but I'm guessing miners will make a lot more in transaction fees even if the average fee was $0.01 per transaction.

I don't follow Clif High very closely. I don't read all of his reports and I don't watch all of his videos. I listed EVERY prediction he made about Bitcoin that I know the details about.
I do remember him making, back in July 2016, a prediction about the price of Bitcoin being around $1,000 or $1,200 (I can't remember) at the end of December 2016. But I don't remember the details, and I don't remember the numbers, so I didn't list it here.
The way I understand it, his software does NOT make the predictions, he does. He makes the predictions BASED on what his software (WebBot) finds.
Lets say his software finds A LOT of football fans and sports experts talking (in September) about how the Raiders will win the Super Bowl. And this talk is WAY MORE talk than any other talk about a different team winning the Super Bowl. So if the numbers are so overwhelming, Clif will make a prediction in September that the Raiders will win the Super Bowl in February.
The software just collects and compiles massive amounts of data for him, but then he has to interpret that data and turn it into predictions.
I find his system very interesting, so I try to learn as much about it and him as I have time for. I wish I could find more minutes in a day. I'd know a lot more about Bitcoin and probably Clif High too.

Not really TELLING people when to buy... More of a suggestion, or a reminder to Buy The Dip!
People tend to shy away, or are afraid to buy when the price drops. But then, how much you want to bet that if the price goes up to $750 tomorrow, there will be a buying frenzy.
So this is just a friendly remember to Buy The Dip. It's YOU who has to decide if this dip is low enough for YOU to throw a few bucks at BTC.

I'm liking Glidera MUCH better than Circle. They have a better buy price, and they started me off with HIGHER limits than Circle.
I also like that with every buy, Glidera sends the coins to any address you give them. You can buy for yourself, or get an address from a friend and send the BTC right to them, saving a transaction fee.
One bad thing with Glidera... Don't be in a hurry to get your BTC. You're LOCKED into the amount of BTC and buying price, but you won't receive the BTC for up to 5 business days. With Circle you get your BTC almost instantly.

I don't know why you think SegWit would make transactions 1/4 of what the fees are now. I think it will lower the fees to maybe half, maybe less than half. With most of the blocks full these days, and Bitcoin growing bigger and bigger every day, I'm guessing the blocks will be mostly full again shortly after SegWit goes live. Maybe a few months.
What if SegWit lowered the transaction fee a little less than half... Maybe the average fee will go from $0.08 to $0.05. But we know SegWit will allow twice as many transactions to fit into a block.
As a miner.... Would you rather mine a block with 2,000 transactions @ $0.08 each (average), or 4,000 transactions @ $0.05 (average)?
It will cost you the same amount in electricity to mine that block. But would you rather earn the block reward + $160 in fees, or the block reward + $200 in fees?
Of course.... These number are just theoretical, but IF the numbers did work out to be something close to this (long term), SegWit would make it CHEAPER for the users, while the miners make MORE per block.
And if the blocks did start to fill up again, the fees would go right back up to $0.08 (average) @ 4,000 transactions per block, the miners would be pretty happy about that!
I don't know.... Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I'm thinking that SegWit will be good for the whole Bitcoin network long term. And I have a lot of brilliant people on my side (the Core Devs).

SegWit adds lots of new, very complicated, code to Bitcoin. Yet, if you're a programmer and you understand SegWit, and you want to add a layer on top of Bitcoin, SegWit makes it easier to add that layer.

I would not say that a paper wallet is the only way to gift bitcoin to someone who is non techy.
You could give them a hardware wallet after you load it up with some bitcoins. Ledger Nano ~$35, Ledger Nano S ~$85.
Since you're setting it up for them and loading it with some bitcoin, they don't need to know too much.
There is also the "OpenDime" USB stick. Check it out here... [OpenDime](
Of Course, there's nothing wrong with a paper wallet. Just make sure you download the paper wallet website to a flash drive, format and install a fresh OS on an old computer, NEVER connect this computer to the internet (COLD computer), transfer the paper wallet website to the COLD computer using the flash drive.
Personally, I'd print 2 copies of the wallet and store 1 copy for them as a backup, just in case they lose it or they have a fire.

I'm not a Bitcoin expert. Please feel free to correct me where my understanding is wrong.
From what I understand, some people don't like SegWit because of it's complexity. SegWit makes MASSIVE changes to Bitcoin. And even though it's been thoroughly Alfa and Beta tested for over a year, it could still have unintended consequences if it were to go LIVE.
There are also issues with bigger blocks, even though it's one small change.... Simply change the block size from 1meg to 2megs.
When a block is mined, a new block is created by the miner (or mining pool) that mined the last block. Transactions are pulled from the mempool to fill the new block (currently 1meg). That miner then starts mining the new block and transmits the new block to a node, which then transmits to all the nodes and other miners around the world.
With the current speed of the internet, this gives a SLIGHT advantage to the miner who mined the previous block, because they get to start mining the new block as the new block info is transmitted to all the other miners. So... They are actually getting a little head start in the race to mine the next block.
If you were to double the block size to 2megs, this would DOUBLE the advantage to the miner who mined the previous block, and could create more orphan blocks.
Everyday upgrades are made to the internet. New fiber-optic lines are installed making the internet faster. The faster the internet gets, the less advantage that one miner would have, and the less likely there will be orphan blocks.
So... The longer we can put off expanding the block size, the better.
What I don't get.... Is why does the block size have to double (or more)?!?!?!?! Why can't the block size increase to 1.5megs, or even 1.2megs??? When the mempool gets all backed up, a 1.2meg block size will help clear it out faster. At least a little faster. Yet shouldn't take much more time to transmit the block info to all the miners.
From what I understand (and I don't know why) you can't change the block size without a HARD fork. And hard forks are dangerous. So you wouldn't want to attempt a hard fork just make a small change like 1meg to 1.2meg blocks. I guess you'd want to go all the way to 2megs, just to make sure you wouldn't have to do another hard fork anytime soon.
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:57:50
$2,100 really isn't all that much of an "outrageous" prediction. How about a price of $14,000!!!!
Have you ever heard of guy named Clif High? (yes, only one "f")
Basically: Clif High wrote a program (he calls WebBot) that scans the internet to see what people are talking about. Using this data, he makes predictions.
He made 2 predictions, ~6 months in advance, and was RIGHT ON!!!! His 3rd prediction seems to be off a bit, but I think that's because of the Bitfinex hack. His 4th Bitcoin prediction is a price of $14,000 in mid 2017.
Prediction 1: NAILED IT!!!
In July 2015 (BTC was ~$275), Clif High said "Bitcoin will be $420 in early Dec 2015. Dec 9 2015 Bitcoin was $420.
Prediction 2: NAILED IT!!!
In early January 2016 (BTC was ~$430) Clif High said "Bitcoin will be $650 in July 2016. July 8 2016 BTC was $650
Prediction 3: Missed it!
In July 2016 (BTC was ~$670) Clif High said "Bitcoin wil be $888 in October 2016. But most of October Bitcoin was $610 to $660. But this was because of the Bitfinex hack, which no one knew was coming, so people weren't talking about before it happened, so Clif couldn't factor it into his prediction. News of the hack didn't come out until early August, which was after he made this prediction.
Prediction 4: We have to wait and see.
Also in July 2016 (BTC~$670) Clif High said "Bitcoin will be $14,000 in July 2017." He had an explanation which really made a lot of sense. I'm not saying IT WILL happen. But I think there is a good chance it could happen. Basically, he's basing this large BTC price on mass adoption of Bitcoin in 2017. He thinks A LOT more people around the world are going to start using Bitcoin in 2017, which of course, will make the price go way up! He talks about how the very first adopters of Bitcoin are "Visionaries", then people who adopt after them are "Early Adopters", then after that "Mid Adopters", then after them "Mass Adopters". He thinks the transition from "Visionaries" to "Early Adopters" will happen in early 2017. This will be a major transition making a major price increase. Then the transition from "Early Adopters" to "Mid Adopters" will come in mid 2017, which of course will make another major price increase to $14,000 by July 2017.
To me, this all makes sense. Will it happen this way?... I have NO IDEA!
Clif was Spot On with this first 2 predictions. I still believe his 3rd prediction would have been correct if it wasn't for the Bitfinex hack. But, when will his $888 price come in?... Late Dec? Jan? Feb? How many months did the Bitfinex hack hold back the price rise to $888??? Maybe Bitcoin will reach $888 in Jan 2017. If so, that means his $888 was delayed by 3 months because of the hack. Will that mean his $14,000 price will be delayed by 3 months? I don't know.
Since Clif High missed his $888 October prediction, he has spoken very little about Bitcoin. And when he does, his prices and dates seem to be vague.
Maybe his $14,000 price will be pushed back from mid 2017 to late 2017 because of the Bitfinex hack.
Because he nailed his first 2 predictions, I probably have too much faith in him. Maybe he just got lucky the first two times, and his WebBot predictions are all just a bunch of crap. Only time will tell.
If the price of Bitcoin goes over $10,000 anytime in 2017, I'd say that Clif High is really onto something with his WebBot program.

Yes 45sbvad, I think this is a clear violation of the 4th Amendment. But then.... Pretty much EVERY law limiting gun rights like type of gun, magazine size, and the need for carry permits, ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION of The 2nd Amendment.
The 2nd Amendment IS my carry permit!!! "the right of the people to KEEP and BEAR arms shall NOT be INFRINGED."
KEEP = to have or own.
BEAR = to have on one's person.
INFRINGED = to go against as in rules or laws.
Laws do not have to be constitutional. The law makers in Washington and each state can be total MORONS. When they pass these unconstitutional laws, and you're arrested for one, you have to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court.
...And hopefully, you and your lawyer can show how it's unconstitutional and you'll be set free. But in the mean time, your rights are taken away from you.
How do you fix this????.... Pass a federal law that reads "Any politician who votes to pass a bill, the bill passes and becomes law, and later ruled to be unconstitutional, shall go to prison for no less than 10 years."

1.6megs is the biggest I've seen SO FAR!!! This will continue to grow to ~2megs as more and more wallets support SegWit. Then after Schnorr Signatures go live (later this year) we'll have blocks up to 3.8megs.
Is that "cute" enough for you?
People are so impatient. Have you ever heard "Good things come to those who wait."?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:40:06
Yes.... SegWit IS A BLOCKSIZE INCREASE. It takes the blocksize from 1meg and increases it to 3.8megs. NO NEED to take 3.8 and multiply it by 2. This is the point behind NO2X.

This just happened to a friend of mine. She sent ~$700 worth of bitcoin from Coinbase to her own wallet ($5.99 transaction fee). The mempool was backed up 31megs.
The transaction on Coinbase was labeled "pending" right away, but there was no sign of the transaction in her wallet or the blockchain.
About 4 hours later, the transaction showed up in her wallet with zero confirmations. A short time after that it had 1 confirmation.
So sit tight. The bitcoin should be sent. With Coinbase it sometimes takes a while before they even send it. They do attach a "healthy" transaction fee, so once it's sent it should show get confirmed pretty quick.
I'm not sure why they attached such a high transaction fee, then wait 4 hour to even send it. With 31megs in the mempool, they should have attached a ~$2.50, sent it right away, and it probably would have received 1 confirmation faster.

Most people aren't using it because their wallets don't support SegWit addresses.... YET!
EVERY TIME another wallet comes out with SegWit support, we see the SegWit transactions go UP. You just wait... When the vast majority of wallets support SegWit transactions, the vast majority of transactions will be SegWit transactions.
Electrum Wallet just came out with SegWit support last week. BUT, it's not compatible with Windows 7 or 8 computers. AND, if you're updating an old install of Electrum, you won't get SegWit support. You have to do a FRESH install and select "SegWit compatible" Seed Words when setting it up. Now they are saying 2 or 3 more weeks for Windows 7 &amp; 8 support.
Hell.... Even the Core Wallet doesn't support SegWit transactions in the GUI yet. There is good reason for this. They are delaying the release because of B2X. And I know why.
Other major wallets that don't support SegWit addresses YET are: Mycelium, Airbitz, JAXX, Bread, and I believe Samourai.
So just wait.... Wait for all of this to get ironed out, and you'll see a lot more SegWit transactions.

If you want to mine a different coin until the difficulty change, I suggest Credence Coin. Yes... It's a ICO crap coin, but right now, mining it is more profitable than anything other SHA256 that I know about. So you could mine it for 3 or 4 days, get a little bit and stake it (but you have to run the wallet to stake it). I do NOT recommend mining it past the next Bitcoin difficulty change.

Sidechains like RSK are "merge-mined" with Bitcoin. This means, miners who are already mining Bitcoin can also mine RSK for **very little cost**, yet they will receive the transactions fees from RSK. It is a profitable situation for the miners.

I know there is a lot in this post, but this question has been answered several times.
Look...... What if I told you I had two devices for sale.
Device "A":
* If you bought device "A" and installed it on your car, you'd get an extra 12 miles per gallon, BUT, you'd have re-energize this device every 2 years for a cost of $100.
Device "B":
* If you bought device "B" and installed it on your car you'd get an extra 120,000 miles per gallon, and a monthly re-energizing cost of only $0.10.
Assuming these devices really worked as described with no negative effect to your car, which device would you install? Which device would be a better way to spend your hard earned money?
* Gives us 12 extra transactions per second, at a cost of transmitting blocks twice as big, and a blockchain size growth at twice the rate. 
SegWit + Lightning Network + RSK:
* Gives us 120,000 transactions per second, at almost no extra cost.
Why waste your time and money to get an extra 12 tx/ps, when you can get 120,000 tx/ps for just about nothing.
Not to mention other negative things about SegWit2X. Increased block propagation times, which could increase the orphan rate, which would increase mining centralization. And it's a Hard Fork. Which means you need consensus to successfully switch the network over to those rules.... Which SegWit2X DOES NOT HAVE consensus. This is why it's turning into another alt-coin instead of the new Bitcoin.

"extreme measures"? Shutting down, or turning down, your miners for 4 days is "extreme"?... I don't think so.
I'm not talking about Mining Pools shutting down. I'm talking about the small percentage of miners who will actually see this post! What do you think that might be??? I'm betting less than 1% of all miners will even see this post, let alone actually participate.
I don't think that would equal an "extreme" about of hash rate.

I do.... And thousands of people like me.
I run a Full Validating Node. I do prune, so I don't store the complete blockchain, but it's still considered a Full Validating Node because it validates each block, stores it for some period of time (I have mine set to ~1,000 blocks), and then propagates that block, and older blocks too when a new node fires up.
There are many reason to run a node.
1) You're helping the Bitcoin Network.
2) By connecting your wallet to your own node, you KNOW you can trust the software on it.
3) Running a node is the closes thing in Bitcoin to voting. When you run a node, YOU get to pick what software to run on it. If you support Bitcoin XT, you can run a Bitcoin XT node. If you support SegWit2X, you can run a B2X node. If you support SegWit and the Core Devs, you can run the latest software from Core. This is like VOTING for the version you believe in. Miner "signaling" is NOT voting. It's signaling readiness for the update... I don't care what Amanda B Johnson says.

What does it matter now much a 1TB drive costs? Whatever the cost, it's TWICE AS MUCH with 8meg blocks compared to 4meg blocks. And there is a limit for how many hard drives are connected to your computer. **WHY DOUBLE the cost and number of drives for ONLY 12 transactions per second more????**... When there are other solutions coming soon that will give us 120,000 transactions per second with 4meg blocks!
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:25:00
If it wasn't for SegWit, that attack would have filled 3 or 4 blocks. Thanks to SegWit, it only took up 2 blocks. And with SegWit + Schnorr Signatures, it would have only taken up 1 block.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:19:24
If you're upgrading from a previous version, you will NOT be able to use SegWit addresses.
In order to use SegWit addresses with Electrum 3.0, you must create a NEW wallet, with NEW wallet Seed Words. When doing this, there is an option to select Seed Words that are compatible with SegWit addresses. With SegWit compatible Seed Words, SegWit addresses will be the default when receiving BTC.

SegWit= ~2megs = 6 tx/ps
SegWit + Schnorr Signatures = 3 to 3.8megs = 12 tx/ps
RSK Sidechain = 20,000 tx/ps with 10 second confirmations (still 3 to 3.8meg blocks)
Lightning Network = 100,000 tx/sp with INSTANT confirmations (still 3 to 3.8meg blocks)
SegWit2X adds 12 tx/ps..... What's the point? It just uses TWICE the hard drive space, for a gain of 12 tx/ps! Who cares when 2nd Layer and Sidechain solutions are giving us SO MUCH MORE, and the blocksize is still under 4megs.

OK buddy..... Enlighten me... Tell me how you're going to propagate a 32GB block to thousands of nodes, all around the world, with a 10 minute block time.
LOL!!!.... B-Trash has an 8meg block limit, but typically has blocks less than 100K! Why?.... Because NO ONE uses it because it's GARBAGE!
B-Trash has it's great EDA (Emergency Difficulty Adjustment). Why?!?!?!? Because luring miners over with extra rewards is the ONLY way to get miners to mine it. Miners don't mine it because it's a better chain, they mine it for the extra rewards!!! But to do that, you have to mine up to [59 blocks per hour!!!!]( And what does this mean???... This means B-Trash is going to have it's next halving WAY BEFORE Bitcoin has it's next halving. With half the reward as Bitcoin, B-Trash will have to DOUBLE the effects of it's EDA!!!! And that means it will have it's next halving even faster than the last! Then it will have to DOUBLE the effects if it's EDA, AGAIN!!!!
The EDA is an awful short term fix, for a LONG TERM problem.... While creating a NEW long term problem!!!
And now B-Trash wants to Hard Fork to get rid of the EDA.... Isn't that kind of like locking the barn doors after the horses have left?
LOL!!!! Garbage!... Complete and utter garbage!
Can you say "51% attack"???? Would you store your value on a chain where 
[93% of the miners are "others"](
 (UNKNOWN)!!!!! If you would, is suggest you learn what a 51% attack is, AND QUICK!!!!!!!!!!
LOL!!!! Garbage!... Complete and utter garbage!

I think Bitcoin will have Worldwide Mass Adoption one day. Will B-Trash????? For Worldwide Mass Adoption, the network will have to handle AT LEAST 100,000 tx/ps. Without SegWit, what will B-Trash's blocksize have to be to handle 100,000 tx/ps?!?!?!
B-Trash will need a blocksize of 32GB to handle 100,000 tx/ps!!!!! Hahahahaha!!!! Try propagating a 32GB block to thousand of nodes in less then 4 hours!!!!! You can't do it!!! Oh, but wait.... There's a new block every 10 minutes!!! Let me think..... New block every 10 minutes, over 4 hours to propagate..... **I don't think that will work!!!**
Yet Bitcoin will be able to handle 120,000+ tx/ps, with 4meg blocks.

Yep... It's cheap! But WHY USE TWICE AS MUCH OF IT (costing twice as much) for only 12 transactions per second more, when we have sidechains and 2nd Layer solutions coming soon that will give us 120,000 transactions per second with ~4meg blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:55:57
Not in every case. With SegWit + Schnorr Signatures (and 4megs worth or transactions in the mempool), 3.0 to 3.8meg blocks would be common.

Here's more details...
Segwit support: 
    - Native segwit scripts are supported using a new type of
      seed. The version number for segwit seeds is 0x100. The install
      wizard will not create segwit seeds by default; users must
      opt-in with the segwit option.
    - Native segwit scripts are represented using bech32 addresses,
      following BIP173. Please note that BIP173 is still in draft
      status, and that other wallets/websites may not support
      it. Thus, you should keep a non-segwit wallet in order to be
      able to receive bitcoins during the transition period. If BIP173
      ends up being rejected or substantially modified, your wallet
      may have to be restored from seed. This will not affect funds
      sent to bech32 addresses, and it will not affect the capacity of
      Electrum to spend these funds.

Quote from Jimmy Song's post... "*It turns out that if you made a pathologically large Segwit transaction, you can make a block with just the coinbase transaction and a pathologically large Segwit transaction that’s very close to 4MB. Essentially, this pathologically large Segwit transaction would be mostly Witness Data with the block weight just under 4,000,000. That block would be very close to 4MB, but way under 1,000,000 bytes when stripped of witness data.*"
That is with SegWit ALONE. SegWit + Schnorr Signatures would make 3.0 to 3.8meg blocks common.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:48:05
Yes. OK. I've been saying this all along. SegWit, without 2X, is a blocksize increase up to 4megs.
We don't need 2X for 12 more transactions per second, when we have sidechains and 2nd layer solutions that are going to be giving us 120,000+ transactions per second. Who cares about 12, when we are soon to get 120,000.
And Core (and B2X people) could never get consensus on a 2X hard fork right now. To hard fork Bitcoin, and keep the new fork Bitcoin, you need consensus. B2X does NOT have consensus, so it's not the real Bitcoin. It's just another alt-coin.

Nope! Not yet. But it's due out this month or next. But you know how these things go.... They are usually delayed by a month or two, but we'll see.
What do we need for blocks to average 3.0 to 3.8megs?....
* 1. SegWit (NOT SegWit2X)
* 2. Vast majority of wallets supporting SegWit Addresses
* 3. Vast majority of transactions are SegWit transactions. (should happen with wallet support)
* 4. Schnorr Signatures Active
* 5. Mempool holding ~4megs worth of transactions
Of course. If the mempool isn't holding 3.8megs of transactions, you can built a 3.8meg block.
But when these 5 things happen, we will be seeing 3.0 to 3.8meg blocks.
So far, we only have  and

Hey! I want to upgrade my computer to have a 1TB hard drive. How about you buy one and send it to me.
What's that???..... That's too much value for you to send me a hard drive? Oh..... Then why should I have to add a 1TB hard drive to my node every 2.3 years, when I could do it only 4.75 years?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:52:48
Yes... I use pruning on my node. But you can NOT store the complete blockchain offline. There still is a certain number of nodes that need to store the complete blockchain. (I'm sorry, I can't remember what that percentage is.) But there has to be some nodes storing the compete blockschain online, so that the info is there when needed. What if Satoshi wanted to send his coins from block zero? That info has to be there, online and waiting.
And remember.... Taking up too much hard drive space is NOT the only thing wrong with bigger blocks. There is also longer propegation times (which increase the orphan rate and promotes miner centralization). And it's simply a very inefficient way to get more transactions per second..... Why double the blocksize and get 12 more tx/ps, when you can use sidechains and 2nd layer solutions to get 120,000 tx/ps and add ZERO size to the blocks???
It make no sense to S2X (B2X).
NO2X 
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:32:04
This is because most wallets still don't support SegWit address. Once all (or at least most) wallets support SegWit address, the mempool will drop way down, which will drop fees way down.
Soon after that we'll get Schnorr Signatures, which will shrink the mempool even more, dropping fees even more.

Depends on the software you run on your node. I run the latest software from Core. It supports SegWit, but NOT SegWit2X.

@_date: 2017-11-05 20:14:32
Because with the current speed of the internet, ~4meg blocks propagating around the world, to 10's of thousands of nodes, will not cause a significant rise in the orphan rate (higher orphan rates are bad). And, the TOTAL blockchain will grow by ~4megs (max) every ten minutes. This would fill up a 1TB hard drive in 4.75 years.
Propagating ~8meg blocks around the world, to 10's of thousands of nodes, will cause a significant rise in the orphan rate.... Promoting more mining centralization (a very bad thing). And if these blocks were mostly full, they will fill up a 1TB hard drive in ONLY 2.37 years.
If you're against mining centralization, and against node operators having to add a new 1TB hard drive to their node every 2.37 years, then you're against S2X.
If you're FOR mining centralization (a BAD thing!), and you're FOR node operators who store the complete blockchain to have to add a new 1TB hard drive to their node every 2.37 years (a BAD thing), then you're for S2X.
And what do you get out of going from a ~4meg block to a ~8meg block????? About 12 more transactions per second. WHO THE HELL CARES about 12 transactions per second when we are getting the RSK sidechain (which adds 2,000 transactions per second &amp; 10 second confirmations), and the Lightning Network (which will give us 100,000 transactions per second, and INSTANT confirmations)!!!!
So you see.... Taking up that very valuable hard drive space IS NOT WORTH IT, when these other solutions are coming soon.
In 2017, we are going from a 1meg block (pre-SegWit), to a ~4meg block (post-SegWit) in a matter of months, and after the Bitcoin network went live almost 9 years ago. How about we see exactly what we can get out of a ~4meg block BEFORE we start talking about a 8meg block.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:59:52
Yes, I agree with this statement 100%!!!
I've been reading about Bitcoin since June of 2013. It was a VERY different community back then. Much smaller than now, and much more credible. Back then, maybe 80% of what you would find would be the truth. Now it's more like 20%.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:28:51
Wow!.... Did you actually read what I wrote?!?!?!
1.6meg blocks IS JUST THE BEGINNING for SegWit. SegWit with Schnorr Signatures will take us to 3.0 to 3.8meg blocks. 3.8meg blocks ARE something to get excited about. 1.6meg blocks are only something to let us know SegWit is working, and we are on our way to 3.8meg blocks.
SegWit is NOT "supper inefficient". SegWit is not giving us ~2meg blocks because most wallets still don't support SegWit addresses. THEY ARE COMING!!!.... Then Schnorr Signatures are coming. Then, if enough transactions are there, we'll see 3 to 3.8meg blocks.
With ~4meg blocks, B2X is not needed, and extremely inefficient when you consider sidechains and 2nd Layer solutions will give us 120,000 transactions per second. Why would you want 8meg blocks that would ONLY give us 12 transactions per second more than ~4meg blocks?!?!?

@_date: 2017-04-21 03:19:08
Do you see my quote of him at the top???? He's saying he wants SegWit AND a block size increase, and saying that Core Devs are against a block size increase.
SegWit is a block size increase. Originally, SegWit wasn't called SegWit. It was a malleability fix and added layering. The Core Devs ADDED the SegWit code just for all the people and miners who wanted a block size increase. They worked hard and found a way to cram 1.6 times the amount of transactions into what the old nodes will see as a 1meg block, and it's still only a Soft Fork. SegWit IS the compromise.
The ONLY reason why some of the miners don't want Segwit, is that it breaks their covert ASICboost. They do NOT want BU. They are USING the BU people as a diversion to keep the attention off the real issue..... SegWit breaks their covert ASICboost.
What can you do except feel sorry for the BU supporters. They are be PLAYED LIKE A FIDDLE by the big miners.
SegWit IS the best way forward, and the miners know it. They're just trying to delay it for as long as they can so they can use their ASICboost as long as they can.

I think the original poster is a little confused. Before this post, I never heard of **asicbleed**. I think he meant to say **Antbleed**.
First there was **ASICboost** = A way to mine more efficiently, but it relies on the block structure not changing. (SegWit changes the block structure in such a way that breaks the overt version of ASICboost. This is the real reason Antpool (Bitmain) is against SegWit. It takes away their advantage.)
Then came allong **Antbleed** = A backdoor in the firmware of the more recent Antminers (the past few years) from Bitmain. This backdoor allows Bitmain to turn off the hardware no matter where in the world it is.

So you're saying the Core Devs know the words in code, but don't understand the core? OMG.... I know they understand it better than I do. I'm pretty DAMN SURE they understand it better than you, the BU Devs, or any other Devs.


Really????..... You're going to use a Hollywood Movie to make a point about reality? Well... I'm sure that in a movie BU would be the best way to go. In reality, SegWit is best.


They are talking about the beginning! Soon after activation. That is NOT "best case with 100% transactions" and nodes on board. A few months later, 2x. A few months after that, 3x. And a few months after that, 4x. Not to mention Lightening Network taking a lot pressure off of the blockchain and the mempool.


You're all mixed up and turned around here my friend. SegWit is NOT contentious. It has been made contentious by BU and the miners using the covert ASICboot. At this point, do you really think these miners want BU???? NO WAY!!!! To them, BU is just the distraction they needed to take the focus off of they covert operations. They are USING the BU community. They are playing the BU community like a fiddle. SegWit (by accident) breaks the covert ASICboost advantage.... And they don't want to lose that advantage, so they want to delay SegWit for as long as they can. BU just happen to be a convenient distraction.
 &gt; If it was such a winner why has it not been activated with flying colors?
See what I wrote about ASICboost a few lines above this.


It's hard to be SURE why they are doing what they are doing. But there are some reasons that could be true...
1) Other pools are benefiting from covert ASICboost. Antpool IS NOT ALONE in this. I'd give it a pretty high percentage that F2Pool is in on covert ASICboost too. How many others.... Who knows?
2) They were coerced. Paid off or threatened: If you signal for SegWit, we won't sell you anymore antminers (or not give you a discounted price).
3) They are planning to switch, but haven't yet. This is the most complicated upgrade for miners to date. Depending on current hardware, they might need a hardware upgrade to do it. These things take time.

@_date: 2017-04-06 17:02:04
Maybe... But I still think changing from SHA256 to something else is too drastic.
Simply changing the orientation of the block (which is what SegWit does) in a way that negates ASICBOOST, removes the advantage from that 'particular group".... Creating a level playing field for all. No "revolt" needed.
Let's just get back to Bitcoin working the way it was intended to work.

Bitcoin is working GREAT!!! It's so GREAT, that people are willing to spend $0.50+ to send a transaction, when just 2 years ago sending that same transaction would have cost $0.03 or so.
Is Bitcoin having some growing pains, yes. But this is all going to be worked out. Just be patient.
Bitcoin having growing pains is a good thing! It means a lot more people are interested and getting involved. And Bitcoin needs to evolve in order to handle all the new people wanting to use it.
So buy some Bitcoin, sit back, and relax. All these technical issues **will get worked out.** It will just take some time.
And when this block size debate is over (yes, it has been going on for too long) Bitcoin will be **BIGGER and BETTER** then ever!!! And you're going to wish you bought more Bitcoin back when it was under $1,200 and having "huge problems."

If you think the hand full of BU Devs know what's better for Bitcoin than the 120+ Core contributors, you might want to rethink your position.
The Core Devs are the Best Of The Best. No one knows the code better than them. No one knows a better way forward for Bitcoin.
SegWit sucks? It's a Soft Fork instead of a Contentious Hard Fork. It's a malleability fix. It's a block size increase, allowing for 1.6 to 4 times as many transactions per block to free up the mempool. And it allows for layering on top of Bitcoin like the Lightening Network which will have instant transactions and increased privacy. All designed and fully tested by 120+ of the best developers in the space.
BU is a Contentious Hard Fork. No malleability fix. Not fully tested. Brought to you by a hand full of second class developers.... Ummmmmm..... No thank you!!!!

OK torusJKL.... For the most part, I believe I STAND CORRECTED! (how's that for cap lettering myself!) People talk so much crap these days. It's hard to get to the truth. I typically what to read or hear a statement 3 or 4 times before I think it's true. But there's nothing like going directly to the source.
My understanding now is: With SegWit a near 4 times the transactions in a block is HIGHLY unlikely and will probably never happen. 3 times would be extremely unlikely. Even 2.5 times would probably be pretty rear.
It all depends on how much multi-sig transactions are used. If A LOT of people were using 2of2, 2of3, 3of3, and so forth, maybe 2.5 to 3 times MIGH be somewhat common. Who knows what the future brings, but I don't see multi-sigs being used that anytime soon. Maybe 10 to 20 years down the road, but even that is a BIG maybe.
I'd say SegWit will give us 1.6 times the transactions per block at least. And even with multi-sig becoming more popular (yet never filling a block with only multi-sigs), it would probably max out at about 1.8 times the transactions. Maybe 2 times, but that would be very rear.
From the Segwit website: (*this is not a quote, but summing up*)
*Although a near 4x transaction increase is possible with SegWit, it is unlikely a block will every have that many transactions in it.
With a block totally made up of standard single-signature transactions (no multi-sigs), about 1.6 times the transactions will fit into a block.
With a block totally made up of 2of2 multi-sig transactions, about 2 times the about of transactions will fit into a block.*
Just me again:
But, SegWit also gives us layering. The most popular layer being Lightening Network. Which will take a lot of pressure off the block size and the mempool.
Keeping the block size under 4megs is VERY important. To use a wallet that stores the blockchain or run a node, you have to download the whole blockchain. (there is pruning now, but the blocks will have to be download and verified before they are pruned. Pruning just helps with storing the blockchain.) Keeping the blocks smaller, keeps the blockchain smaller, and is less of a burden on the whole system. Layers and sidechains can pickup the slack.
The RSK (RootStock) is looking pretty promising. It's a sidechain that adds Ethereum type contracts and allows for 100 to 400 transactions per second. But their goal is to reach 2K transactions per second using Lumino Compresson Technology. AND, it will have 10 SECOND CONFIRMATION TIME! **So there is the "I wand to buy a coffee with Bitcoin" answer.** It's in it's finally stage of testing now. It could go LIVE next month!
I just found out about RSK last week. This block size debate is blinding us to all the awesome things coming down the line for Bitcoin. And I still think ANYONE who thinks they know better, what's best for Bitcoin, is kidding themselves.
Activating SegWit. What are the benefits?...
It's only a Soft Fork. Much safer. No worries about ending up with two chains (two coins).
We'll get near 2mgs of transactions per block.
A malleability fix.
Layers like Lightening Network.
And if RSK works out (SegWit not needed) 10 second confirmations and 100 to 400 transactions per second, and 2,000 transactions per second a few months down the road! Unlike Lightening Network, these are transactions the miners mine and get paid for. (at next to nothing extra cost of mining)
There are so many great things that can happen to Bitcoin. This block size debate is one big distraction in itself. I just don't understand how anyone can think that the Core Devs are out to destroy Bitcoin. OF COURSE they are doing what they feel is best. And these guys are into the code up to their eyeballs. They are a lot of great minds all working to make Bitcoin the best it can be. Are there other ways doing things, sure. And some of these ideas are really good ideas, but they need a Hard Fork, and a Hard Fork is not a good idea at this point. Two Bitcoin chains is not what I'd like to see, and a unanimous Hard Fork is out of the question. It has to be a Soft Fork. And SegWit is the best Soft Fork solution.

Because it's NOT easily avoidable. On the **surface**, it just seems so easy. Simply change that little old "1" to a "2", and DONE! Boy, that was easy. But when you dive in **deeper**, knowing the code and how it works and is put together, SegWit is a much better option.
Put simply, it is not that simple. Changing that 1 to a 2 creates a whole new set of issues. Not only is that create a Contentious Hard Fork (SegWit is a Soft Fork), it would be a short term fix, it wouldn't fix malleability, and it wouldn't add layering. 
SegWit starts off with an effective blocks size increase of 1.6 to 1.7 times. Months later will go up to 4 times.
SegWit gives you a malleability fix and layering. BU and other solutions don't.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:26:04
From what I understand, SegWit will prevent ASICBOOST from working.
ASICBOOST needs the current block structure in order to work. You can make the block bigger (that's why they Antpool &amp; F2pool were for bigger blocks) but as long as the structure is the same, ASICBOOST will still work.
SegWit changes the way the block is put together. It changes the structure. Rendering ASICBOOST useless.

I see where you're going with this. It very well could be that or just the "luck variation". Too hard to tell with this small sample. We'll have to check again later.
But then, they could have just added more mining hardware. So then we'd be back to my original question... Why switch sides but limit your block size to 1mb or less?

It's not that far. UCR is just off the 60 freeway (I believe). You just need to take the 60 west, to the 15 north, to the 10 west, and then take the Mountain Ave exit. Head south down Mountain a few lights and you're there. The trip should take you about 35 minutes.
If you don't have a car, find 2 or 3 people who are interested in Bitcoin. Hopefully, one of them will have a car. Everyone chips in a couple of bucks for gas, and carpool to the meeting.

OK then.... Did you make another transaction (a 4th transaction) after this one?
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:52:57




Come one now.... If they know the code the best (how it works and why things work the way they do) it's simple logic that dictates they would know the best path for Bitcoin to grow and move forward.


No. People "in the know" like Andreas Antonopoulos, Trace Mayer, Tone Vays, and others, all say that the Bitcoin Core Devs are the Best Of The Best in the cryptocurrency space. They know what they are doing, and know the best way forward for Bitcoin.


No way. You're not doing your research. If SegWit were to activate TODAY, it might give you a 70% increase of transactions (and a 70% bigger block, yet nodes not supporting SegWit would see that block as 1mb or less), but not after most wallets and nodes switch to support SegWit. At that time, the increase would be ~4x the transactions and ~4x the block size (while any lingering nodes not running SegWit would still see a 1mb block, hence the Soft Fork).
If you think SegWit sucks and FlexTrans is the way to go because it "gives you the same benefits without the technical depth", then you don't fully understand the issues with a Contentious Hard Fork and you don't understanding the Bitcoin code or writing code well enough to make these types of decisions.
How do you know FlexTrans is better?.... Did you take the BU Devs word for it????


I don't think so. They came up with a WINNER! The miners who dumped a boatload of time and money into hard coding ASICboost into their chips, they are the ones who made the wrong choice. They are the ones who failed... By backing an advantage that is dependent on the block structure NOT EVER CHANGING. But the structure needs to change (not just get bigger) in order to fix malleability and move Bitcoin forward.
They should have spent their money on making faster chips, instead of hard coding a HACK into a chip.
Do you actually think the miners want BU?!?!?! Hahahahaha!!!! They DON'T!!!! Them supporting BU is just a distraction from the TRUTH. The TRUTH is they don't want SegWit because it breaks their hack.
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:37:42
Ok... Those transactions have a 0.00027 mining fee. The mempool is backed up 31 blocks right now. For a 31 block backlog, that mining fee is a little low. It should have been around 0.0005 to 0.0008, but 0.00027 is probably OK as long as you're not in a hurry.
I'd give it pretty good odds that these transaction will go through in the next few days.

@_date: 2017-04-27 23:43:09
So.... You didn't really do anything with the previous two transactions. You simply sent a 3rd transaction, with a high fee, and that pushed everything through????
Ummm..... I don't think that worked. I can see your latest transaction, and that (right now) only has 2 confirmation. You're previous two transactions have 9 confirmations. So they comfirmed 7 blocks BEFORE the last transaction confirmed.
Is it possible your first 2 transactions confirmed, but you didn't notice they confirmed, then you sent the 3rd transaction?

When it comes to hardware wallets, it's hard to go wrong. They are all **way** better then holding your bitcoin on a computer or cell phone. Trezor, Ledger Nano, Ledger Nano S, KeepKey, they are all good and will store your private keys away from any computer or phone virus.
I own several Ledger Nano's, but I bought mine before the Ledger Nano S came out. If I were buying today, I'd get the Ledger Nano S.
The **best** overall hardware wallet (ignoring price) would have to be the Trezor. It's open source and probably the best. If you don't mind the price tag (~$100 + $30 shipping on the Trezor website) get a Trezor.
I really like my Ledger Nano's, but they have to be set up on a **cold** computer.... Kind of a pain. So just get a Ledger Nano S, and you don't have to worry about that. Just set it up on any computer and start using it. (~$90 + FREE or cheap shipping on Amazon.)
I don't know much about the KeepKey, but I've heard some good things about it. (~$100 + FREE or cheap shipping on Amazon.) KeepKey is supposed to be the easiest to use, but I think once you do a few transactions with any of these wallets, you'll find they are all easy to use.

Yes. I suggest everyone read what he wrote. [I do not support the BIP 148 UASF](
But don't give up on **miner** activation just yet!
F2pool just switched to support SegWit. Yes, I know they switched as a joke on April Fool's Day, but this time I don't think is is a joke.
Wang Chun tweeted about polling the miners mining on F2pool. It came back that 56% wanted SegWit, so he switched.
A few days ago Bitclub Network **stopped** signaling for SegWit. VERY disappointing. But Bitclub is a smaller pool than F2pool.
Losing Bitclub but gaining F2pool should change the SegWit signaling from ~28% to ~38%. (*We'll have to wait a few weeks to see this. F2pool switched a couple of hundred blocks into the current 2016 block period. So this period might be closer to 35%, but next period should be ~38%. And ~38% is going to look pretty sweet compared to the ~28% I've been staring at for MONTHS!*)
And who know... Hopefully Bitclub will switch back to signaling for SegWit, and maybe some other pools too. By the end of Summer, we could be looking at 50% or more signaling for SegWit.
This block size debate has been going on for way too long, and it's been very frustrating. But the Core Devs gave SegWit a time limit of 1 year to activate, so lets give them that 1 year.
An increase from ~28% to ~38% is a nice little boost. A boost to Bitcoin and to my hopes of getting SegWit activated this year. And if by the end of Summer it's closer to 50%, that's going to be another nice (*and much needed*) boost.
We all want the same thing... We want Bitcoin to be better tomorrow, than it is today. But sometimes we have to settle for... Better next year, than this year.

RSK will allow for up to 400 tx/sec when it first comes online May/June. A few months down the road they will add Lumino compression, which will then allow for 2,000 tx/sec.
Oh.... And lets not forget about confirmation times!.... **About 10 seconds!!!**

Mining, in general, does **not** need to change. There is **nothing** wrong with the current system, except for the flaw in Bitcoin that allows for ASICBOOST. This flaw needs to be removed, and everything will be back to a level playing field.
Changing Bitcoin's SHA256 mining to some other method would wrongfully punish all the innocent miners who dumped millions of dollars into building their SHA256 mining farms.
Drastic change isn't needed. Just fix the problem. The problem is the flaw that allows for ASICBOOST.
SegWit fixes this flaw. This (finally, after all this time the truth comes out) is the true reason why Antpool and F2pool are against SegWit. SegWit fixes this flaw and removes their 20 to 30% advantage. And they don't want to lose that advantage.
Release a BIP that only fixes this flaw. Make nodes reject blocks mined with ASICBOOST (if this could be done).
I'd update my full node (currently running 0.14.0) in a second to 0.14.1 if it fixed this flaw.
**NOTE to all the other pools not taking advantage of ASICBOOST and not signaling for SegWit.**
By not signaling for SegWit, you're helping the pools that are using ASICBOOST to have a 20 to 30% advantage over you. Level the playing field, help Bitcoin move forward, signal for SegWit.

@_date: 2017-04-13 23:07:45
Yes... Could be coercion.
But I don't think the "monoculture" of SHA256 is the problem. The problem is they found a way to mine more efficiently, but it's dependent on the block structure NOT changing. Which to me means... ASICboost is NOT an optimization, it's a hack.
Switching from CPU mining to GPU mining was an optimization. Block structure or anything else didn't matter. They simply performed SHA256 faster than CPU's, which is an optimization.
Switching from GPU mining to FPGA mining was an optimization. Block structure or anything else didn't matter. They simply performed SHA256 faster than GPU's, which is an optimization.
Switching from FPGA mining to ASIC mining was an optimization. Block structure or anything else didn't matter. They simply performed SHA256 faster than FPGA's, which is an optimization.
Adding ASICboost to ASIC mining is NOT an optimization. It is dependent on the block structure NOT changing. It's dependent on Bitcoin NOT advancing and NOT improving. It is a "ball and chain" around Bitcoin legs, holding it back from advancing. Which means it's NOT an optimization, it's a hack!
So there's nothing wrong with SHA256. What's wrong is the miners who invested a lot of time and money putting their ASICboost HACK into their chips for a covert advantage, then not wanting Bitcoin to advance because it would break their HACK and take away their advantage.
In other words... They bet on the wrong horse! They bet it would be better to spend their time and money on a HACK, instead of designing a new chip that would performed SHA256 faster.
So lets get SegWit in to make Bitcoin even better, and move on.
@_date: 2017-04-15 07:50:27
Yep... He got me GOOD on April Fools Day. I was all excited he switched to signaling for SegWit, then a couple of hours later his tweet about April Fools Day came to my attention and I was like "Damn, he got me!"

No WAY is this true. Satoshi ADMITS to not being a great programmer. He had this great vision, and overall outstanding idea. But he's a good programmer at best.
**Gavin....** I like Gavin. He seems to be a nice guy and intelligent. And he has done SO MUCH for Bitcoin in it's early stages. But a great programmer (in a large portion of the population), he is not. In the early days, there were not many people involved with Bitcoin. It was a VERY small community. Out of this VERY small community, Gavin was one of the best programmers!!! But, as the community grew bigger, better programmers started to get involved. Slowly but surely, Gavin was getting pushed to the bottom of the list of who's best. I feel sorry for Gavin, I really do. But out of the bigger community, containing much better programmers, Gavin just wasn't cutting it.
To Gavin: You did SO MUCH for Bitcoin, when Bitcoin needed you. You're a great guy, and I wish you well.
**Mike....** Well... I don't know much about Mike. From the little I do know, Mike's relationship to Bitcoin could be a lot like Gavin's.

Thanks you! There was some great info in there. According to that, if the wallet is shut down and not rebroadcasting the transaction, it will drop out of the mempool after 3 days.
That's the best info I've seen on the subject yet!
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:13:15
Yes... There are things you can do, but they aren't easy.
For the future, the best thing you can do is support SegWit. SegWit will greatly reduce the strain and backlog on the mempool, returning mining fees back to 4 to 8 cents (you just paid about 36 cents on each transaction).
Until then, you could try some of these solutions for your current issue...
**Ask a miner for help**
Some mining pools and miners offer services to allow you to prioritize your transaction in their mempool so that it is chosen sooner for inclusion in a block. You can contact the users Quickseller and macbook-air. These two users have access to F2Pool's transaction selector and they can help you with confirming your stuck transaction. You can also try using  to "accelerate" your transaction. Note that ViaBTC does have a limit the accelerator to 100 transactions every hour and requires that it pays a minimum fee rate of 10 satoshis/byte, so their accelerator may not necessarily work.
Also note that if you attempt an Replace-By-Fee transaction, both the original transaction and the RBF transaction will be considered double spends and miners will likely not help with any transactions marked as double spends.
**Attempting a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) double spend transaction**
**What is an RBF transaction**
A Replace-By-Fee transaction is a transaction that is nearly identical to your stuck transaction but pays a higher transaction fee. Since the original transaction most likely does not use Opt-in RBF, the RBF transaction that we will be creating will be considered a double spend and marked as such. The transaction uses Full-RBF and thus may still take a little bit longer to confirm as it is technically a double spend.
**The difference between the types of RBF transactions**
Replace-By-Fee transactions have 3 different types, First-Seen-Safe(FSS) RBF, Full RBF, and Opt-in RBF. FSS RBF requires that the RBF transaction include the same outputs as the transaction it replaces and consumes the same inputs. Full RBF means that the transaction is simply a double spend of another transaction but pays a higher transaction fee than the one(s) it replaces. Opt-in RBF means that the RBF transaction can only replace a transaction that has Opted-in to allowing itself to be replaced. Opt-in RBF follows [url 125[/url].
The instructions given in this section will be for making Full RBF transactions. Opt-in RBF transactions will be described in the "Avoiding Stuck Transactions In The Future" section.
**How to make a Full RBF transaction**
Making a Full RBF transaction depends entirely on the wallet that you are using. Some wallet support the advanced functionality required to make a Full RBF transaction, others do not. The following will be guides for each wallet on how to make a Full RBF transaction with that wallet. In general the procedure is to remove the unconfirmed transaction from the wallet and then resend the Bitcoin but with a higher transaction fee.
When making a Full RBF transaction, the transaction should include the recommended fee rate at the time of creating the transaction. See the "Avoiding this issue in the future" section for help with that.
**Bitcoin Core**
Bitcoin Core makes making Full RBF transactions very easy. Simply go to the transactions list, right click the transaction that is stuck, and choose the "Abandon Transaction" option.
If that option is greyed out, then you must restart Bitcoin Core with the -walletbroadcast=0 option and then you should be able to use "Abandon Transaction".
If the above two options fail for some reason, then you can start Bitcoin Core with the -zapwallettxes option to clear all unconfirmed transactions from your wallet.
Once the transaction is either Abandoned or cleared from the wallet, you can simply go to the Send tab and send the Bitcoin again but make sure that you include a sufficient transaction fee.
**Bitcoin Armory**
Bitcoin Armory also makes making Full RBF transactions very easy. Go to Help &gt; Clear All Unconfirmed Transactions and restart Armory. This will clear all of the unconfirmed transactions from the wallet and thus allow you to create the Full RBF transaction. Once Armory has restarted, simply send the Bitcoin again as you normally would but be sure to include a sufficient transaction fee.
**MultiBit HD**
MultiBit HD allows for making Full RBF transactions fairly easy as well. Go to Manage Wallet and click on Repair Wallet and follow the wizard. This process will clear all of the unconfirmed transactions from your wallet much like Bitcoin Core and Armory do. Once repair wallet has completed, simply send the Bitcoin again as you normally would.
**Wallets that do not allow you to or ones that I don't know how to make Full RBF transactions**
Not all wallets support the creation of Full RBF transactions. Many wallets do not allow clearing all unconfirmed transactions to allow for making Full RBF transactions. The following is a list of wallet software which do not support Full RBF transactions. If a wallet on this list does support FullRBF transactions, please let me know and provide instructions for that so I can add it above.
* Blockchain.info and web wallets in general
* Electrum (supports Opt-in RBF, but not Full RBF)
* Mycelium
* MultiBit Classic
* Bitcoin Wallet for Android
* Breadwallet
* Copay
**Attempting a Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction**
**What is a Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction?**
A Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) transaction is exactly as the name implies, a child transaction spends from an unconfirmed parent transaction and includes a transaction fee which covers both the fee of the child and the parent. However creating CPFP transactions are much more difficult as it requires spending from an unconfirmed transaction, something that most wallets do not allow.

Wow!!!... This guy, after all of these months, still doesn't understand SegWit **IS a block size increase!**
When SegWit is activated, we'll be able to fit 1.6 times the about of transactions into a single block. As more multi-sig transactions are used, this could go up to 2 times the transactions. Then add Lightening Network on top of that, and the system can handle 100,000 transactions per second. And lets not forget about RSK... RSK will add Ethereum "like" contracts, ~400 transactions per second (2,000 per second after Lumino Compression is added later), **It will also give us 10 second confirmations!!!** ...And this guy still thinks we need bigger blocks?!?!?!
We can't "simply" keep increasing the block size every time we need more room for transactions. To increase the block size to 2mb now, then 4mb later, then 8mb after that, and so on, would need to be a Hard Fork each time. Yes... Much smaller coins seem to do Hard Forks with no or little issues. But they aren't a 20 Billion dollar network. At this point, a contentious Hard Fork is extremely risky for Bitcoin. Why take that risk when there is another way? SegWit adds capacity, is a malleability fix, and allows for layering networks like Lightening.
My best guess is that after SegWit, Lightening Network, and RSK, the Bitcoin network will be able to grow so much, we won't need bigger blocks for 5 to 10 years. Maybe longer. Who know what other improvements will come down the line during that time.
How about this Mr. Jiang Zhuo.... We activate SegWit now. We give it a few months to see how things go and time for Lightening Network to added. RSK (not needing SegWit) can go live next month, regardless. **Then, 5 or 6 months after SegWit is activated, and we still need bigger blocks, I WILL BE BEHIND YOU 100%, banging the drum for bigger blocks.**
Getting support for bigger blocks will be EASY, if SegWit, Lightening, and RSK all fail to relieve the pressure from the mempool and the blocks size.

Yes, thank you. I have heard about this "pay with credit card to push" service. But I don't feel that it's necessary just moving BTC around from one wallet I own, to another wallet I own.
I'd really like to know how long a transaction will be in the mempool before it's kicked out? And..... How will I know it's been kicked out? And what will I have to do to resend after it's been kicked out.
I've been using Bitcoin for about 3 years. But I've always included a healthy mining fee, so I don't know what I need to do in this situation.

OK shitpersonality, you convinced me. Or should I say Greg Maxwell convinced me. (Greg Maxwell = Awesome Dev)
You pointed me in the right direction, so I must give you credit too. Thank you!
I'm not saying I understood everything on that page, but I got enough of it to see that one or the other could be neutralized.
Although, I don't really understand why you'd want to block one from working and not the other.
If you're going to take the time to block one method of ASICBOOST, why not just block both?
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:29:06
I don't consider ASICBoost (software or embedded in hardware) an "optimization". It's more of a hack or exploit.
An "optimization" would be a way to preform SHA256 faster... PERIOD.
ASICBoost does SHA256 faster, BUT ONLY when hashing a bitcoin block with the current block structure. If the structure changes, ASICBoost will lose it's 20 to 30% advantage.
This means that whoever is using ASICBoost is not going to want the block structure to change. The change could render ASICBoost useless. And if a miner, or group of miners, is big enough, they will try to block advancements to Bitcoin like SegWit, which changes it block structure.
An "optimization" to Bitcoin Mining, isn't an "optimization" if it means that Bitcoin has to remain stagnant.
Free Bitcoin from the chains holding it back. Block ASICBoost (software &amp; hardware), activate SegWit, and get Bitcoin moving forward again.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:04:37
As a miner (for over 3 years) this is really beginning to piss me off.
If you're a manufacture of mining hardware and found a way to mine faster and more efficient, good for you!!! **As long as your little mining "boost" doesn't rely on Bitcoin being stagnant!!!... Unable to grow or advance."**
If your "boost" requires that the block structure doesn't change, that's on **YOU** if you invested millions of dollars into your "boost" and then the best way for Bitcoin to move forward involves changing the block structure!!!
You **KNEW** your boost depended on the block structure never changing. You **KNEW** Bitcoin is an evolving, changing, growing system....
You bet your millions. You profited for a few years. I'm sorry.... It's time for you to lose your advantage. It's not like you can't mine anymore. You just lose your advantage.
SegWit is the best way forward for Bitcoin. Your covert boost advantage shouldn't hold Bitcoin back.
My mining is signaling for SegWit.
My full node is signaling for SegWit.
**Note to any miners out there NOT signaling for SegWit:** If you're not using ASICboost and not signaling for SegWit, you are helping Antpool and F2pool to have a 20 to 30% advantage over you.
Start signaling for SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:42:28
NO!!! This presumes miners using ASICBoost are AGAINST SegWit, because it breaks their boost.
There are lots of ways forward, I NEVER said they are for BU, I said they are against SegWit.
The miners using ASICboost KNOW SegWit is the best way forward for Bitcoin, but they don't want their boost broken, so they are delaying signaling for SegWit as long as they can by **pretending** BU is a better way forward just to take focus off them and put it on the Block Size Debate. Trust me.... They know BU is BS. They just want to hold onto their boost as long a possible.
@_date: 2017-04-07 02:13:23
OK... I read 1,2, and 3. But I'm not sure how credible these people are. What they are saying doesn't make much sense to me (with my limited knowledge).
Ok, yes... I guess there are "covert" and "overt" versions of the ASICBOOST code, meaning.... First there was known (overt) code in mining software, then Bitmain put that code (or at least similar code) into their chips secretly (covert).
But both versions of the code work the same way, so they both need the block structure not to change.
But the ASICBOOST in the chip would be much faster since it's built into the chip. And that would be the biggest advantage to having it in the chip.
All of these kinds of details come out sooner or later. But I need a Core Dev or someone I really trust to come out and say "SegWit will stop the covert but not the overt" before I'll believe it.

This issue has been blown WAY out of proportion.
**Can** this happen, YES. But how often is someone going to go through all this trouble to **rip off** a coffee shop owner for $4.50?!?!?!?
The best way to think about this is to compare it to counterfeit money. Can a dollar bill be counterfeit, YES. Do coffee shops accept counterfeit bills everyday, YES. Does this mean they should **stop** accepting cash?... NO!!!!
Counterfeit bills are used to buy things everyday. From big retail stores to Mom&amp;Pops shops... They all take steps to make sure every bill they accept is real, yet everyday a counterfeit bill makes it into the register.
Accepting counterfeit money is just part of doing business, and it's factored into the price. That $4.50 coffee would only cost you $4.45 if **no one** passed counterfeit bills.
So why to coffee shops accept cash? Because.... Most people are honest! Most people don't pass counterfeit money. They just want to pay $4.50 for some coffee and be on their way. And it's only a very small percentage of the population that pass counterfeit money.
With Bitcoin, it will be the same. The vast majority of Bitcoin users will be honest and just want their coffee and be on their way. They're **not** going to be dishonest, and go out of their way, to rip the coffee shop owner off for FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS!
On big ticket items, yes, this is currently an issue. But fear not, fixes are on the way.
SegWit will allow for the Lightening Network. If you use the Lightening Network and open a channel to the coffee shop, you can send bitcoin to them through the channel and it's **instant** (1, maybe 2 seconds and it's confirmed). 
And then there's RSK. RSK doesn't even need SegWit, and it near the end of it's testing phase. It could go live next month! RSK will give us up to 400 transactions per second (2,000 when Lumino compress is added a few months later), Ethereum "like" contracts, and 10 second confirmations!!!!
Yes, that's right... 10 second confirmations!!!! I never had a coffee shop get my drink ready in less than 10 seconds.
So if you still feel this is an issue, wait a month for RSK, and signal for Segwit.
I'm helping all I can by signaling for SegWit with my mining, and I'm signaling with my node too.
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:21:49


Oh. I didn't know you could just change the number. I thought you had to upgrade the software to 0.13.1 or higher. Everyone is always talking about how hard it is for the miners (mining pools) to upgrade to software that supports SegWit.

What are the receiving addresses?
@_date: 2017-04-22 17:08:59
Not really. The transaction fee, is the transaction fee.
The vast majority of Bitcoin users want much lower transaction fees. (Which SegWit will give us. So support SegWit.) But in the mean time, we have to deal with the fees we have.
I know is seems weird to spend $0.50 to send $0.20 but if the person receiving it is will to pay $0.70, then it's worth it. Or, if you're willing to send $0.70 of an item that's worth $0.20, then it's your choice to do that.
I've been selling things on ebay for years. It's quite often I sell something for $5.99 and they select Priority Mail which I charge $8.29. So they are paying $14.28 for a $6 item, just so they can have it in 2 to 4 business days.
So just think for the transactions fee as the "shipping cost" to send cash value (BTC value). Except, Priority Mail take 2 to 4 business days and sending BTC only takes 10 minutes to 2 hours most of the time. (*After SegWit it will get back to ~10 minutes most of the time. And next month RSK could go live (with or without SegWit). RSK will give you 10 second confirmations.*)
So YES!!! Bitcoin can be used for small transactions. You just have to be willing to paid the (currently) high shipping fee. And, SegWit will fix the high shipping fee later this year (hopefully), and RSK should help lower it next month.
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:52:20
OK, this just popped into my head...
I think what I head was... SegWit with Schorr Signatures (added later) would give us up to 4x the transactions per block.
But again... With SegWit adding a much easier way to do layering, and Lightening Network, and Schnorr Signatures, and sidechains like RSK, and other improvements coming, Bitcoin will be able to handle all the transactions the world can throw at it with a 1MB block limit for the next 5 to 10 years (JMO). And the longer we can keep the block size smaller, the slower the total blockchain size will grow.
In the future, the internet and hardware will be able to handle a 2, 6, 10 terabyte long blockchain. Until then, it's a **really** good idea to keep the blockchain as small as we can.
Hell.... After all these improvements, we might be able to **shrink** the block size down to half a meg, and still have the mempool mostly empty most of the time. If we could (*and that's a big IF*) it would be very good for Bitcoin.

You need to go into settings, then under "SECURITY" is "Pin Code". Turn it on. Then, every time the app opens, you have to enter a Pin Number before you can do anything.
Then, if your phone gets lost or stolen, sign in to your Circle account from a computer and delete your credit card info from the account, and transfer any bitcoins you might have in there to a different wallet. Get a new phone, re-install the Circle app, create a new account, add your credit card into this account. And of course, turn on "Pin Code" again. (I don't know why this defaults to being off. Hello Circle... This should default to on.)
Now all is secure!
And yes... Do NOT store large amounts of bitcoin on your Circle wallet, just to be on the save side. If you have large amounts of bitcoin, they should be in a paper wallet or hardware wallet.
Think of your Circle wallet as your real physical wallet... Only put the amount of bitcoin in there that you plan on using that day, or that week. NEVER any more.
And when I use Circle to buy bitcoin, I transfer the bitcoin to my hardware wallet as soon as it comes in. (Unless I'm planning on spending it soon.)

A "bitcoin" can NOT be printed. A bitcoin "wallet" can be printed. But you wouldn't want me to give you a printed bitcoin wallet, because you wouldn't know if I copied the private key or not. Whoever has the private key, controls the bitcoin.
Right now, 1 BTC is worth about $600 USD. Lets say you were selling a bike $600. I could show you a paper wallet and tell you there is 1 BTC on it. On this paper wallet is the public key and private key. You scan the public with a blockchain explorer to confirm there is 1 BTC on the paper wallet. So you say, OK... Give me the paper wallet and you can take my bike. So I give you the paper and take the bike, and as soon as I leave, I can move the 1 BTC from that paper wallet to different address of mine, because I scanned the private key before I got to your house.
Now you have an empty paper wallet and you're minus one $600 bike.
Bitcoin is SO EASY to transfer around from cell phone to cell phone. Pretty much everyone has a smart phone. As long as both parties have smart phones with wallet apps, it's very to transfer some amount of bitcoin from one phone to the next. Wait for 1 confirmation, then hand over the bike.

After using the service for about a month (making purchases every week, most of the time at the limit) I requested a higher weekly limit. Waited a couple more weeks and I'm still at the $300 limit. I then contacted tech support. They said the higher limit is an automated system. Keep using the app and you'll get upgraded to $3,000.
Now here I am, ~5 months later, and I'm still at the $300 limit per week.

GBTC = Bitcoin Investment Trust
I think this trust invests in BTC and BTC startups.
GBTC doesn't have an effect on BTC's price... BTC effects GBTC's price. Or maybe I should say, most of the time.
GBTC is (for the most part) tied to the price of BTC.
Most of the time when BTC goes up, GBTC goes up. And when BTC goes down, GBTC goes down.
But not today. Today BTC went down about $1, yet GBTC went up $4.
Like I said... Buying GBTC is a way to invest in BTC without buying and holding BTC. Then GBTC invests in BTC.
But of course... You have to trust, the GBTC trust. I would never suggest you put all your saving into GBTC. But it you're looking for an investment, that's (mostly) tied to BTC, and only want to throw a small portion of your savings at it, GBTC might be something to consider.

Thank you.
Yes... The "base" blocksize will need to increase. But that's way down the road. With SegWit, and all of the 2nd layer and sidechains it will bring, we might not need a 2X hardfork for years.
(*I'm a little disappointed in the RSK sidechain. SegWit isn't needed for RSK and RSK was supposed to be out on the main Bitcoin Network in July... Where is it? When is it due out now?*)
SegWit2X is a promise to do SegWit now and a 2X hardfork in 3 months (whether we need 2X or not). This does not make any sense for three reasons.
* (1) Three months is not enough time to properly prepare for a hardfork. 
* (2) 2X probably won't be needed in just 3 months. Why do a risky hardfork if it's not necessary?
* (3) Core has a "laundry list" of things they would like to do but can't without a hardfork. So if they are going to do a hardfork, they are going to want to include at least some of these things in the hardfork.
A **contentious** hardfork is easy to do. You just fork off and those who want to support it, follow it.
A **consensus** hardfork is extremely hard to organize. With a consinsus hardfork, you're trying to get the vast majority of the entire Bitcoin community to support it. So if you're going to do a hardfork (Core would want a consensus hardfork), you're going to want to do it right, and this would take a lot more planning than you could do in 3 months.
I have heard that Core is considering a hardfork in 9 to 18 months. This is NOT to say they are planning one. They are "considering" one. There is a good chance that this hardfork would include a 2X increase to the "base" blocksize. But then, maybe it won't.
I have a lot of faith in Core. They always seem to do what's best for Bitcoin. When they say it's time for a 2X hardfork increase, it's time for a 2X hardfork increase.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:54:15
Yes. And the blockweight is in direct correlation to the blocksize. And by Roger not increasing the blockweight, he's mining smaller blocks, which means he has a small block policy. Most people don't know what the blockweight is, so I continue to say blocksize.

I think we're going to see a lot of companies and pools back away from the SegWit2X New York Agreement over the next month or so.
* They didn't know or understand what they were signing.
* Some at the event felt pressured to sign.
* Some thought it would start a new chain, and stop the original chain, moving everyone on the new chain.
* They don't want to be on a Bitcoin chain without the Core Dev Team behind it.
There are ZERO Core Devs behind SegWit2X. Bitcoin without the Core Devs, is a Bitcoin without me.

What they need to do is keep making GPU's for graphic cards, but also make SHA256-MPU's (Mining Processing Units) and SCRIPT-MPU's.
We know AMD and nVidia are good at making GPU's. This is why GPU's aren't designed in China (both AMD and NVidia are headquartered in California).
I'd bet that if AMD and/or nVidia made SHA256-MPU's, they'd be much faster and more efficient than the Chinese ASIC's. (but probably cost more)
Yes... They'd need new design teams and new manufacturing plants, but they can do it. And these chips wouldn't flood the video card market, and they'd kick A$$ over the Chinese ASIC's.

I'm not twisting anything! Right now, Roger can mine bigger blocks and he refuses. All of that BS about wanting bigger blocks was just that, BS, if he doesn't mine bigger blocks.
Wanting or not wanting SegWit is irrelevant at this point. Bitcoin has SegWit, and there's no turning back. At this point, either Roger wants bigger blocks, or he has a small block policy.
And by the way.... Roger does NOT have a no-SegWit policy. He's on the record for wanting SegWit2X. A big part of SegWit2X is SegWit!!!
Come on now.... It's obvious what he's trying to do. He's continuing to mine small blocks to try and make it look like SegWit isn't good enough, so that we NEED SegWit2X. I don't believe this plan will work. Once there are many more wallets supporting SegWit, the few pools that are still mining small blocks won't matter. **Roger will just be mining with his small block policy** and he'll be missing out on a bunch of extra transaction fees, which will go to the pools mining bigger blocks.
And the mempool will still be mostly empty without the help of his little pool mining small blocks.

But how can he get away with this crap! How can he say 10,000 times "I want bigger blocks", then refuse to mine bigger blocks, and then no one says a work about it.

Wrong, wrong, wrong.... So wrong!
This website show the true size of every block mined. When the number on the far right is green, it's showing you a blocksize BIGGER than 1meg.
I've been watching this website EVERYDAY since SegWit activated. Roger's pool (bitcoin dot com) has NEVER mine a block over 1meg, yet all these other pools have.

Once you have SegWit addresses available in the GUI, why would the user have to click "advanced options" to use SegWit? SegWit should be the default, and the user should have to go into "advanced options" to turn SegWit addresses off.

Yes... Hard to know for sure, but there probably was a lot of spam transactions in these blocks.
But what these 2 blocks show is.... How much better the Bitcoin Network can deal with spam with SegWit. Because of SegWit, the network was able to get rid of an **extra** 687K worth of spam in 2 blocks. And SegWit is just getting started. Block 484398 only had 2.8% worth of SegWit transactions, and 484398 only had 1.7% of SegWit transactions. Just wait until blocks are 20, 40, 60% SegWit..... And then we get Schnorr Signatures towards the end of this year!!!! It will not be worth it to spam at all.

I never heard LukeJr say he wants smaller blocks. He seemed to be in favor of SegWit, and SegWit is a blocksize increase.
Roger, on the other hand, was on a "I want bigger blocks" MAJOR CAMPAIGN!!! I heard him say it every time I saw him on a show or a debate for the better part of the past 2 years!
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:47:54
Yes Skyfox, I have heard these "excuses" before.
I don't know... I guess I had a lot more faith that SegWit would become active than the wallet developers.
I understand that the wallets don't want to work on a feature that might not ever get activated. That would be a waste of resources. But come on!!! This is Core's **best** update since Bitcoin started. It was bound to become active sooner or later.
Just think..... If there was **just one** of the major software wallets like Electrum, Airbitz, Mycelium, or even JAXX, that has been working on a SegWit compatible GUI and was ready for release the day SegWit went LIVE..... Do you realize how popular that wallet would be right now?!?!?!
The wallet that did this would now be the ** Software Wallet** by far right now. To me, they all dropped the ball on this opportunity.
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:17:05


No. You are WRONG!!!
As an example, the last block Roger's pool mined was block 486200. This block has 1844 transaction, of which 114 are SegWit transactions (6.18% SegWit transactions).
He's not rejecting SegWit blocks (as you say). He's not rejecting SegWit transactions.
Roger has his mining software set to a maximum blocksize of 1meg. Since Aug 23rd, he could change this maximum limit from 1meg to 4megs.... **But he refuses to do so!!!** This means he supports **small blocks!**
**Roger Ver has a small block, high fee policy!!!**
What a LIAR! He has been going around for the past 2 years speaking out against small blocks. **Now he has the opportunity** to mine bigger blocks, **AND HE REFUSES!!!** Roger obviously has a small block policy.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:06:20
OK... Once again.... Because he's been screaming, for the better part of the past 2 years, "I want bigger blocks!"
Right now, he can have bigger blocks, but he refuses.
There's nothing wrong with mining bigger blocks NOW, and still support SegWit2X. Mining bigger blocks NOW, would show me that he really does want bigger blocks.
But when he has the ability to mine bigger blocks, and he fails to mine bigger blocks, this makes him look like a liar and a hypocrite.
Lets say you needed $1,000. And I said "I'm sorry man, I can only give you $500 right now." Would you say "I'm not taking your damn $500!!! Give me $1,000, or give me NOTHING!!!"
I doubt it. You'd take the $500 now, and then HOPE to get another $500 later.
Roger is not taking the $500, because he's throwing a temper tantrum that I'm not giving him the full $1,000, which probably isn't even needed for a long time. He could do just fine with $500, but he won't even take it to see if it's enough.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:35:45
Personally, I don't think it matters (to the overall Bitcoin Network) if Roger mines blocks bigger than 1meg or not. There are enough much larger pools that are mining bigger blocks to make up the difference. And when more wallets come out with updates that support SegWit addresses, it will matter even less what Roger does.
The thing that gets me is that Roger has been going around campaigning for 2 years about wanting bigger blocks, but now that he can finally mine bigger blocks, **HE REFUSES!!!**
To me... This make Roger a liar, a hypocrite, and a fraud.
**Roger:** Call your mining pool administrator and tell him to change the maximum blocksize from 1meg to **4megs!!!**.... Or forever be known as a liar, hypocrite, and a fraud. Now more "Bitcoin Jesus"..... Now he is Bitcoin Lucifer!
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:17:40
Yet no one says a word?
I'd really like to bring this to the forefront, so the next time Roger is in an interview he's asked "You've been campaigning for years now in favor of bigger blocks. Since Aug 23rd you're able to mine bigger blocks on Bitcoin. Why has your pool not mine ONE block bigger than 1meg?"

@_date: 2017-09-11 15:46:31
Bitcoin has had a blocksize limit of 1meg for about the past 6 years. A block can hold about 2,000 transactions. A new block is created (on average) every 10 minutes. Which means the Bitcoin Network can only handle about 3 transactions per second. (*For comparison, Mastercard processes 39,000 transactions per second. and VISA 56,000. For a total of 95,000 per second.*)
So for Bitcoin to get World Wide Mass Adoption, it's going to have to go from 3 transactions per second to at least 100,000! Probably closer to 200,000 or 300,000. The good news is.... Bitcoin is nowhere near mass adoption at this point. Bitcoin probably has 10 to 20 years to work this out. But for right now, Bitcoin does need more than 3 transactions per second.
People using Bitcoin are currently making more than 2,000 transactions per minute (3 per second) some of the time. Which creates a backlog of transactions waiting to get into a block. In order to get your transaction in before all the other transactions waiting, you have to attach a higher transaction fee for the miners, so the miners take your transaction first, making other users wait longer to get into a block. So having this backlog creates higher transaction fees and longer wait times for confirmations.
There are two main ways that allow Bitcoin to process more transactions in a block.
* Increase the blocksize from 1 to 2megs. But then you'll have to increase it again to 4megs, 8megs, 16megs, and so on.
* SegWit (Which is a blocksize increase for up to 4 megs, but also makes it much easier to add "2nd layer" solutions like Lightning Network and sidechains and drivechains.
So this is what everyone has been fighting over.... A simple increase of the blocksize, or SegWit (which is also a blocksize increase).
The people in favor of simply making bigger blocks are known as "Big Blockers". And the people in favor of SegWit are known as "Small Blockers" (even though SegWit increases the blocksize up to 4meg.). SegWit has been active for less then 3 weeks, and most wallets don't support it yet, BUT..... We have already seen blocks over 1.3megs!!!! But most are only 1.001megs. But this is only because most wallets don't support SegWit yet.
**The Big Blockers:** What the Big Blocks can't seem to understand is that each block gets added to the blockchain. The whole blockchain needs to be transmitted to new nodes, and most nodes store the complete blockchain (some nodes prune the blockchain which means they only store the last 1,000 blocks or so.). Because of the transmitting and storage of the blockchain, you don't want the total blockchain size to get out of control (too big, too quick). The way to keep the total blockchain size low as possible, is to keep the blocksize as low as possible. To continue increasing the blocksize to 2megs, then 4megs, then 8megs, then 16megs, and so on, is adding that many megs to the total blockchain size EVERY 10 MINUTES. Imagine a file on your hard drive that you add 16megs to every 10 minutes!!!! How long will it take until your hard drive is full?!?!?! But wait!!!!!...... Bitcoin needs to have at least 100,000 transaction per second one day. To do 100,000 transactions per second by only increasing the blocksize, you'd need a blocksize of about 33gigs!!!.... Not 33megs, 33gig!!! Now imagine adding 33gigs to that file on your hard drive EVERY 10 MINUTES!!! Now how long will it take for your hard drive to fill up? (Go ahead.... Do the math. How long?)
**The Small Blockers:** Small Blockers understand you CAN'T simply keep making the blocksize bigger, bigger, bigger, and bigger. SegWit is a blocksize increase, but only to 4megs. But SegWit makes it much easier for 2nd Layer solutions and sidechains. The first 2nd Layer that's due out soon is the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network alone can handle 100,000 transactions per second, off the main chain. This means these transaction are not being added to the blocks, and aren't added to the total blockchain size. This means Bitcoin can compete with VISA and Mastercard, and only have a 4meg blocksize!!! But the Lightning Network is only the beginning. There will be other 2nd Layer solutions and sidechains that will increase Transactions Per Second even farther, give us better fungibility, and much better privacy. All thanks to SegWit!!!
(Some 2nd layer solutions and sidechains can happen without SegWit, but SegWit makes them A LOT easier to do. SegWit also optimizes the Bitcoin Network Nodes, allowing them process the blocks much faster.)

@_date: 2017-09-21 06:07:40
I don't know about Luke "dreaming" about a 300K blocksize. I believe at one time he might have been considering it.
But it's pretty easy to see that no one person runs Core. Core is a team of 120+ great developers who consider all options before doing the best.
But there is one person who runs bitcoin dot com mining pool. There's only one person who can call the pool administrator and say "Change the maximum blocksize from 1meg to 4megs." That one person is Roger Ver, and he refuses to do it because he has a small block policy. Which means HE'S the one who wants high transaction fees and long wait times for confirmations.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:57:35
Towards the end of this clip, Roger says "*The Small block and high fee policy has destroyed most of Bitcoin's first mover advantage.*"
This would lead one to believe that Roger is AGAINST small blocks. Yet, since SegWit activated on Aug 23rd, Roger could mine blocks bigger than 1meg, but he REFUSES to mine bigger blocks.
Since Aug 23th, there have been ~2,000 blocks bigger than 1meg. **Roger's pool mined ZERO of them.**
It would seem to me that **Roger Ver has a small block policy!!!**
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:22:28
WRONG! Roger CAN mine blocks bigger than 1meg on BTC. All he has to do is change his mining pool software from 1meg to 4meg (the recommended setting from Core is 4megs).
Roger IS mining blocks with SegWit transactions. He's just capping it at 1meg. There is NO REASON for this (unless you're trying to make SegWit look bad).
Roger is refusing to mine blocks bigger than 1meg. In reality, **Roger has a small block policy.**
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:31:33
What about Roger Ver? Basically campaigning for 2 years saying that he wants bigger blocks, yet now that he can mine bigger blocks, **he refuses to mine bigger blocks!!!**
SegWit transactions are about 3.5% right now, but this is because the most used wallets haven't been updated yet to support SegWit. Once this happens, the percentage of SegWit transactions in each block will go way up. And we'll start to see blocks 1.2megs, 1.3megs, up to 2megs. Then later this year Schnorr Signatures will come out and we'll see blocks up to 3.8megs.
But for Roger's mining pool to mine blocks that big, he will have to change the maximum blocksize limit in his mining software from 1meg to 4megs. Other pools have done this, but he refuses.
I guess the truth is out.... **It is Roger who has a "small block" policy!!!**

Ever since SegWit activated, blocks are allowed to be up to 4meg in size. Although.... We'll won't see a block that big for a some time, and they will be very rare. But it will not be rare for blocks to be 3megs to 3.8megs.
The past few weeks, most blocks over 1meg have been 1.01megs to 1.07megs. I've seen 2 blocks that were 1.3megs.
The reason why most of the blocks over 1meg are just a little bit over 1meg, is because the vast majority of wallets don't support SegWit.... YET! One or two wallets per week are coming out with updates that add SegWit support.
Right now, about 4% of the transactions in a block are SegWit transactions. When more wallets add support, this 4% number will go higher and higher.
After Mycelium, Airbitz, Electrum, and JAXX add SegWit support, I think the SegWit percentage per block will grow to 40 to 60%. At this point, blocks will average 1.2 to 1.6megs in size.
When the vast majority of wallets support SegWit, blocks will be 1.6 to 2.1megs in size.
In Nov or Dec of this year, the Schnorr Signature update should be out. At this point, we'll start seeing blocks 3 to 3.8megs.
This is why the Core Team advised the miners to change the maximum blocksize setting from 1meg to 4megs. Bitcoin Nodes will accept blocks up to 4megs, but we won't see blocks that big until more wallets support SegWit and the Schnorr Signature update is released.
But Lying Roger REFUSES to change his setting from 1meg to 4megs like the Core Team advised. I've heard Roger say 100 times... "Core has a small block policy." But Core came out with an update called SegWit, which INCREASES the blocksize, and Roger's mining pool refuses to increase it's maximum blocksize limit... **So it is ROGER who has a small block policy.**

[HERE IT IS](
Using a SSD drive, apposed to a hard drive, you don't need an external power source for the external drive. You can plug the SSD directly into the Pi's USB port, and no other cables or power adapters are needed.
Sometimes the power meter is showing 3 watts, but most of the time it's 2. I guess you could count that as 2.5 watts, as this meter doesn't display fractions of watts.
This equals ~$0.40 USD of electricity per month. MUCH LESS than running a node on a desktop or even a laptop.

You are not running "Core 1.15.0.1". You are running "Core 0.15.0".
You **SHOULD NOT** post your IP address. The YES2X people might attack your node because you're vocal about being NO2X. Or even attack any computer at that location.
There are no direct monetary benefits for running a Bitcoin Node. By running your own node, you get...
* A trusted node. You can transmit and receive your transactions through it, knowing the software on that node is TRUE Core software, and you don't have to trust some other node that you have no control over.
* Running your own node is the best way to VOTE for the way forward for Bitcoin. If you think SegWit2X is best, you could run a B2X node. If you think Bitcoin Unlimited is best, you could run a BU node. This is the closest thing to "voting" there is in Bitcoin. Miner "signaling" IS NOT VOTING!
You obvious have faith in the Core Devs because you're running Core 0.15.0 on your node. I thank you, and commend you in figuring out that the BEST TEAM in the space (the Core Team) knows the BEST way forward.

The miners vote with the version of software they run on their node. The miners "signaling" their readiness for an update when they mine a block, is ONLY signaling their readiness.... And NOT a vote for which software to run.
Miners, Merchants, Users, and Speculators can voice their opinion.... But the best way to be heard is to run a node, and run the version of software they support on that node. I run the latest SegWit version on my node because through my own research I believe it's the best.
Users, miners, merchants, and speculators "vote" for Bitcoin (in general) by mining it (miners), or accepting it (merchants), by using it to buy things (users), or holding it (miners, merchants, users, and speculators).
But the best way to "vote" for Bitcoin's path forward (ex: best way to scale) is to run and node running the software that you feel is best. If you feel Bitcoin Unlimited is best, run BU software on your node. If you feel Bitcoin XT is best, run Bitcoin XT software on your node. If you feel Bitcoin Classic is best, run Bitcoin Classic software on your node. If you feel SegWit is best, run SegWit software on your node.
Running a node with the software version you support is one of the best ways to get your point across.
I've been running a node 24/7 for the past 6 months. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.

November?!?!?! Wow! I sure hope it's sooner than that.
I'd really like to see the vast majority of wallets have SegWit support **before** the end of October at the latest! And I'd like to see Schnorr Signatures active by the end of October too. But it looks like we aren't going to get Schnorr Signatures until Dec or Jan.

To this: **git clone -b 0.15 
And left everything else the same, and now I'm running 0.15.0!!!

For the past TWO YEARS [Roger has been going around stating that Core has a "small block policy"]( yet Core came out with SegWit which increases the blocksize to ~2megs, and 3.8megs after we get Schnorr Signatures in Nov/Dec. This doesn't sound like a small block policy to me.
**Roger Ver** is the one who has a "**small block policy.**" Ever since Aug 23rd (when SegWit activated) Roger could be mining blocks over 1meg, **but he REFUSES** to change the maximum blocksize in his mining software from 1meg to 4meg. Core recommending changing this number to 4megs shortly after SegWit activated, **yet Roger's mining pool continues to mine blocks under 1meg!!!**
Roger Ver is the one with a **small block policy!!!**
It is Roger Ver that's is...
* Promoting higher transaction fees
* Promoting longer wait times for confirmations
* Making it easier to perform a double-spend
Roger Ver, start mining blocks over 1meg or you will continue to be known as **Bitcoin Lucifer - The Fallen Angel Of Bitcoin.**
When someone campaigns for bigger blocks for **TWO YEARS**, then has the opportunity to mine bigger blocks but **REFUSES**, that person is a **LIAR** and a **HYPOCRITE!!!**

How many times did I say this stuff about "you needed $1,000"??? I do believe that was ONCE!
So what about that? Are you telling me you would say "No" to the $500???
I keep repeating my argument because it would seem some people need it repeated. Just like they heard Roger say "*Core has a high fee, small block policy*" 100's of times, maybe those same people need to hear what a liar he is 100's of times.
Core does not have a high fee, small block policy! They came out with an update called SegWit that's a blocksize increase which is reducing fees!
Roger on the other hand has been saying "*I want larger blocks*" and "*We need larger blocks*" for 2 years. Yet RIGHT NOW he can mine larger blocks, but he REFUSES!
So I guess if Roger needed $1,000 and I offered him $500, he wouldn't take it.

I have a big problem with your first sentence.... "*I don't oppose Segwit2x on the grounds that 2MB blocks are too large.*"
Segwit2x will give us **eight meg blocks!** (Nodes that haven't upgraded will see the blocks as 2megs, but they **will have up to 8megs** worth of transactions in them. They are 8meg blocks!)
* SegWit = ~2meg blocks (when most wallet support SegWit addresses)
* SegWit + Schnorr Signatures (due out Nov/Dec) = up to 4meg blocks
* SegWit + Schnorr Signatures + SegWit2x = up to 8meg blocks
We have to **STOP** thinking in terms of this "base" blocksize (currently 1meg).
**Bitcoin, right now, has a ~2meg blocksize limit.** (as long as the vast majority of wallets support SegWit addresses, and the vast majority of the transactions are SegWit transactions)
Why some of the most popular wallet providers are dragging their feet in coming out with an update for SegWit addresses, I have different theories. But who cares?... We are now more than **2 months** past SegWit Activation. If your favorite wallet doesn't support SegWit addresses, it's time to switch wallets.
Hardware Wallets Supporting SegWit:
* Trezor
* Ledger Nano, Nano S, Nano Blue
Software Wallets Supporting SegWit:
* Armory
* GreenAddress
* Coinomi
* BitGo
I believe Electrum, Samourai, and Bitcoin Core-qt wallets will release updates soon that will support SegWit addresses.

[Roger has been campaigning]( for the past 2 years for bigger blocks. Every since SegWit activated (Aug 23rd) he could be mining bigger blocks, **but he refuses!!!**
Roger is mining blocks with SegWit transactions, **but he has the blocksize capped off at 1meg!** Core Devs messaged all mining pool weeks ago to inform them that it is now OK to change the maximum blocksize from 1meg to 4megs. **But Roger refuses to do this!** He's still mining blocks 1meg or less.
All this BS from Roger about wanting bigger blocks!... What a load of crap! What a LIAR!! What a hypocrite!!!

After 2 years of campaigning for bigger blocks, and claiming others have a [Small Block Policy]( it is really Roger who has the small block policy.
Every since SegWit activated, Roger could be mining blocks over 1meg, [but he refuses.]( Why Roger? Why did you "claim" to want bigger blocks, and now that you can mine bigger blocks, you won't do it.

If you've been in the space for many months or years, yes, you're a total dumb ass if you're tricked into thinking Bcash and Bitcoin.
But if you're new to the space, all of this can be very confusing. And then you see Roger Ver in an interview wearing a shirt that has BCH on it, then below it has Bitcoin dot com.... What's the newbee supposed to think? BCH is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is digital cash, so I need some Bitcoin Cash?
Try to put yourself in the shoes of the newbee who isn't very technical, and I think you will agree this could be very confusing.
I believe this was by design... That Roger and Jihan picked the name Bitcoin Cash because this name would make it easier to trick the newbee into picking BCH. This is why Roger gets so upset when you call Bitcoin Cash, Bcash. He WANTS the name "Bitcoin" in there. He NEEDS the name "Bitcoin" in there.

He's either a liar and a hypocrite, or he's too lazy to change his mining software maximum blocksize setting from 1meg to 4megs.
How could Roger just get away with this? Am I the only one who can see his mining pool has NEVER mined a block over 1meg?!?!? His pool isn't all that big, but it's found plenty of blocks since SegWit activated. He should have mined at least 9 or 10 blocks over 1meg. But he's got ZERO over 1meg.

Why?..... Because he's been going around for the past 2 years screaming "I want bigger blocks, NOW!" Well... Right now he can have bigger blocks, and he refuses.
Yes... A softfork means users, nodes, miners, can update when they get around to updating. But he already updated. He's running SegWit mining software. If he wasn't, he wouldn't be mining any SegWit transactions, but he is.
The only thing he hasn't done is change that "1" to a "4" in his mining software. Which means.... He has a small block policy! **The very same thing he's been accusing Core to have for the past 2 years!**
But, how could Core have a small block policy, when Core came out with SegWit, which is a blocksize increase!!!... Up to 3.8megs!!!!
It's obvious Roger loves his small blocks. He can mine bigger blocks NOW, but he doesn't. Maybe he'll mine on the SegWit2X chain, yet still have his software set to a 1meg limit.

You're right sis755... For the most part. As long as the wallet you import the private key to is on a hot computer.
But... If the wallet is on a cold computer (not connected to the internet, and never will be) it would be safe to import the paper wallet key, sign the message. copy and paste the message into a text file on a USB drive. Then plug that USB drive into a hot computer, and do with it whatever it is that you wanted to do with that signed message.
Note: If the cold computer is running Linux as the OS, and you install Electrum on it (from a USB drive of course), and the cold computer has a webcam, Electrum will use the webcam to read the QR code for the paper wallet's private key. Making it very easy to import the private key.

Right, there is not setting for transaction fees on the Circle Wallet. That's because Circle is an exchange. It's FREE to send bitcoins OUT of your Circle Wallet. It's the same with most (if not all) exchanges.

Yes, but like I said.... It could have been a really fast block time. He said that block times are 10 minutes. I was trying to point out that block times are not 10 minutes, they're 10 minutes on AVERAGE. Which means it could have been 1 second.
Or, like you said, the ATM takes chances. He didn't say how much the transaction was for. Maybe it was a small transaction and the ATM only takes chances like this on transactions smaller than $100.

Very nice story. Thanks for sharing.
I don't know about hodling until you die. Not much point in that unless you're leaving it in a trust to your kids or charity.
For me.... I'm going to hodl until I retire. At this point, I think having bitcoin at about 10% of your retirement fund is reasonable. But I understand how other people might think 5% is good or maybe even 20 or 30%. I guess it would depend on each person's faith in Bitcoin and their individual retirement goals.
Imagine going to a Baby Shower and giving them an envelope marked "College Fund - Do not open for 18 years". Inside the envelope is a Bitcoin Paper Wallet you just load with $50..... What's that going to be worth in EIGHTEEN YEARS?!?!?!!!

ZERO cost for him to set up a wallet and start accepting bitcoin. Business banking accounts for him to accept checks, VISA, Mastercard, typically have costs.
He does NOT have to give up any of his identity to accept bitcoin. Banks always want your identity. (one more place your identity could be stolen)
ZERO cost for him to accept a bitcoin transaction. VISA, Mastercard will charge him 2.75 to 5% on each transaction.
Bitcoin has better security. If he gets robbed, there will be less cash in his register for the thief to steal. If his Bitcoin Wallet is on his phone and they steal his phone, the thief can't get his bitcoins without his 6 digit PIN (Mycelium Wallet). He simply buys a new phone, inputs his backup words (Wallet Words), and he gets his bitcoins back.
He could become a Bitcoin Dealer. He could buy and sell bitcoins with his customers (cut out Liberty X) charging a small fee and make even more money trading Bitcoin. (There may be legal issues for him to consider for this, depending on where this pawn shop is.)
When accepting bitcoin, his can store some or all of it for long term as an investment, if he believes bitcoin will continue to go up long term.

4. What happens if Ledger becomes unsupported in the future?
The first thing you would need to do is get a different Hardware Wallet like the Trezor. Then use Multibit HD on a computer or Mycelium on an android phone to restore your Ledger wallet addresses (using the wallet words "backup" you wrote down when you setup the Ledger). Then you could send the bitcoin to the new hardware wallet.
Of course, this is only if Ledger stops supporting the product. Which possible, but not likely.
The Ledger Nano S uses a Chrome extension to interface with the device. But next year Chrome is going to start phasing out extensions. This is an issue, but Ledger is working on it.
I'm confident they will come up with a solution before Chrome ends its support.
I have a Ledger Nano (not the S) and love it. Great little hardware wallet.

**RageTester:** 72 hours is the old limit a transaction would stay in the mempool. Earlier this year the limit changed from 3 days to 2 weeks.
Last week I had 3 transactions take 5 days to complete. This was not a problem for me because I was only moving some funds from one of my wallets to a different wallet of mine. I wouldn't have mind if it took the whole 2 weeks.
**Birdez:** No need to CPFP or RBF. At this point, you only need to be patient. You sent this 4 days ago, so you still have 1 week and 3 days until it will be kick from the mempool if it doesn't go through.
The miner's fee you on the transaction is not all that small. The problem is, you sent the transaction when the mempool was on it's way to being backed up to over 70megs!!! It's now back down to a 31meg back log. I'm guessing.... If it gets down to 10megs (maybe 15megs) your transaction will go through.
To fix this type of thing from being an issue, support SegWit. SegWit will allow almost twice as many transactions into each block, clearing the mempool twice as fast when it does get backed up, which will keep transaction fees much lower and confirmation times much faster.

Now you're talking about something completely different! Buying $.50 worth of product for $3 is one thing.... Buying the whole bar (or all the people in your party) a round of drinks is another.
Just like accepting a  person check or credit card, the bartender can now ask for valid ID, note NAME and ADDRESS, and tell you "*Sure, you can pay for all these drinks with bitcoin, but if you try to leave this bar before there is 1 confirmation, the bouncer is going to grab you... Do you still want to pay with bitcoin?*"
EDIT: Also, I know bars that when you want to start a tab, you have to give them your Driver's License. This way, you can't skip out without paying your bill. So, if your "round of drinks" is over a certain limit, the bartender can always take your DL and only give it back to you when there is a confirmation.

You're probably just seeing the broadcasting of the transaction. Which typically takes a second, or sometimes 2 to 4 seconds if things are running slow. But a transaction should be considered "completed" until there's at least 1 confirmation.
It's the confirmations that take 10 minutes. But that 10 minutes is "on average." A confirmation can take 1 second or 3 hours. But "on average" they take about 10 minutes.

Help Please!
I don't know Linux much at all, but using two different tutorials I managed to get a 0.14.0 Node running using a RP3 with Raspbian Jessie. No hard drive. It's all running off of a 32meg MicroSD, pruned to 1024. It's been running great for a couple of months now. (only burning 1watt of electricity I might add / about 15cents per month)

I switch my 0.14.0 Node to 0.14.1 yesterday!
I like a lot of what Eric Lombrozo has to say. And now he has gone public supporting BIP148.
The miners can always do the right thing and support SegWit before August 1st. But if they don't, THE PEOPLE (the nodes) HAVE SPOKEN... We're getting SegWit.
* All Core Nodes = 88% of the node network
* Core Nodes v0.14.1  = 31.01% of the node network
* All Bitcoin Unlimited Nodes = 9.5% of the node network
If you were a miner with millions of dollars invested in hardware, which network would you mine???
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:53:26


Yes. mmeijeri is right. They've been signalling for SegWit for at least 2 or 3 months, but it's a rather small pool that only gets 1 or 2 hits per 2016 block period. BCMonster and Solo CKPool are other small pools that get 1 or 2 hits per two week period.
Bitcoin India is another small pool, but it looks like they've been doing some expanding. They use to get 2 or 3 hits per period, but they've been getting 6 or 7 lately.
Slush's Pool allows each miner to signal for Core (SegWit), BU, no vote at all, or Pool Operator Decides For Me. They usually end up 3 to 1 (majority for SegWit), to 6 to 1 (majority for SegWit). Current percentages are.... Core (SegWit) 44%, Pool Decides 28%, BU 15%, and No Vote 13% by miners. My Hash Rate... Core (SegWit) 41%, Pool Decides 27%, BU 19%, and No Vote 13%.
Come on Slush Pool Miners.... How can you, at this point, be set to No Vote or Pool Decides For Me?!?!?!?! Do some research, let your voice be heard. Vote for Core (SegWit) or BU. (preferably Core).
BitClub Network was signalling YES for SegWit pretty much from the beginning, but switched to NO a few weeks ago. This was right around the time they stopped allowing members from the USA into their cloud mining club, and when Roger announced he was going to start up a cloud mining service..... Hmmmmm.... A connection???? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:26:25


**It does!!!!!** After one confirmation. Bitcoin has always been like this. A transaction was **never** considered final, until there was at least 1 confirmation. Except then the mining difficulty was much lower... Then 3 to 6 confirmation were recommended.
Right now, with too low of a transaction fee, one confirmation can take too long. **This is a temporary issue** until SegWit is activated. We will get SegWit by Aug 1st with the UASF, or maybe even before that if the miners pull their heads out and start signaling for SegWit sooner.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:16:38


Because Bitcoin is a **30 billion dollar** protocol. Hard forks are risky, and should be avoided if possible. This is why the Core Devs came up with SegWit. It will allow 1.6 to 3.8 times the transactions to fit into a single block. **SegWit IS a block size increase!** But does it while only being a soft fork. Not to mention... SegWit is also a malleability fix and allows for layers like the Lightening Network. SegWit is the **best way forward** at this time!
So here's the deal. Here's the smart way to do it....
Activate SegWit **NOW!!!** See how much it improves the network. See exactly how much stress it takes off the mempool, lowering transaction fees and shortening confirmation times. Then, if sometime down the road scaling is in issue again, take the **best way forward** at that time.
At that time, maybe a hard fork block size increase will be the best way forward, and maybe not. Who knows what technology will come out from now until then. There is **NO WAY** the Core Devs should "promise" to do a hard fork within 12 months if a hard fork isn't needed. Maybe SegWit will fix the block size issue for the next **5 to 10 years!**... Or maybe we will need to hard fork to 2megs 9 months after SegWit activates. It's really hard to tell exactly fast Bitcoin will grow if blocks were less than 75% full and transaction fees were low.
So lets activate SegWit **now!** And promise... If and when scaling is an issue at some point down the road, the Core Devs will take the **best known action** at that time.

Well.... A MASF is safer than a UASF, but I think the UASF will be pretty safe.
Last night the node count for 0.14.1(BIP148) nodes was 2,251. Right now it's 2,301 which is 31.5% of the total amount of nodes.
Lets see how much this node count keeps growing over the next month or so. I would love to see this percentage get much bigger, but from what I read it's already at a very safe level.
@_date: 2016-05-17 23:16:21
I don't see how? Adjusting for a 10 minute block time more often should only keep the block time CLOSER to 10 minutes. It will give the block time LESS TIME to deviate from 10 minutes.
Please explain how it would make the block time less stable.

Wow!!!.... Hello!!! McFly!!! Anyone home?!?!?!
LN was not ready when SegWit came out in November 2016. **It's ready now!** It's running on LTC **NOW**. And it's been running on the Bitcoin Test Network for over a year.
You're arguing valid point in Nov, 2016. **Wake up!** It's May, 2017.
The Core Team hasn't been sitting on their asses since Nov, 2016. They are hard at working, looking for new ways to deal with block size issues **without** a hard fork... Like compression. With compression, we might be able to fit **6 to 8megs** worth of transactions into that same 1meg SegWit block.
We **shouldn't** make promises now, to do a risky hard fork later, when it **might** not be needed, or there **might** be a better solution at that time.
Let take the best way forward now. As for any issue that comes up 2 months down the road or 10 years down the road, we should take the best solution for that issue at that time.

OK.... But it seems like you think I purposed to average the past 144 blocks. I didn't.
I said to adjust it every 144 blocks (everyday), but when you do that, you average the past 1008 blocks (the past week).
If that's not a big enough sample to average, ok then, average the past 2016 blocks, but average the past 2016 blocks every 144 block (which would be close to everyday).

I recommend...
YOU GET YOUR 100+ COINS OUT OF THERE..... NOW!!!
Lets assume Coinbase's Cold Storage is 100% unhackable. You still have to worry about new regulations that could keep you from your bitcoins. Also, Coinbase could go out of business or get shut down because of some new law, which would result in you losing your bitcoins.
And let's not forget Mt. Gox! I don't think they got hacked. That was an inside job. (IMHO) And if an inside job could happen at Mt. Gox, it could happen over at Coinbase too.
"If you don't HOLD the private keys, you don't OWN the bitcoin!"
Coinbase is fine for buying or selling bitcoins. But after you buy from Coinbase, get whatever you bought out of there ASAP.
Get a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. That's your safest bet.

7 confirmations now. It looks like it took about 31 hours.
You had a pretty good miner fee at 0.0006264. But boy, that mempool is really backed up. It's over 82megs right now.
This is one more example of why we need SegWit. SegWit will take a lot of the pressure off the mempool, lowering transaction fees and shortening confirmation times.
Support SegWit!!!
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:48:03
OK... Let not forget that the current situation in Bitcoin right now is temporary. Once SegWit is active transactions will be cheaper and confirmations faster. And all of this will be much less of an issue than it is right now.
But once again, you're off topic from the original post... Buying a beer, and people thinking there's an issue with that.
So let's shift gears and talk about a $150 purchase at a bar....
I don't know how old you are, so maybe you don't know this, but back in the olden days (before the year 1995, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth) the  way to pay for something besides cash was paying with a check. How long did it take to get "confirmation" that the check was good????.... Well, about 1 week. If the check didn't get "confirmed", it would bounce back sometimes longer than a week.
So what did the businesses do to protect themselves? They would ID the person writing the check. The business either knew them because they were regular customers, or they'd ask for a valid ID to make sure they lived local. So that if the check ended up bouncing, they could track them down to have them buy the bounced check back with cash, or the business could take them to small claims court. And it the customer was from out of town, the business simply would not take a check.
So if you came into my bar wanting to start a tab using bitcoin, I'd say "Sure, you're a regular, run up any tab you like."... Or I'd say "I'm sorry Mr. I don't know you. I'll need to see valid ID. OK, now that I have your DL# and I see you live across town, you can pay with bitcoin up to $40." Or I might say "I see from you valid ID you live out of state, I can start a tab with you but only up to $20."
If you think about it, the ways a business can protect itself are endless. As the business owner, you just have to think about it and come up with a company policy. Put it in place. See how it works. Make adjustment as necessary.
The bartender can always say "Sure, you can start a tab. Send me $20 now with a **healthy** transaction fee, and if that goes through before you're done drinking that $20 worth, we can start another working on another $20 (or $10, or $40, or whatever) tab.
Once again.... **Most** people are honest. They just want their coffee or beer, and pay what they owe.
And please don't forget, this situation is **temporary**. Once SegWit gets in, transaction fees will drop and confirmation times will be much quicker, not to mention the Lightening Network.
At this point, **none** of the 800+ alt's are very promising. They don't have the market cap, they don't have the volume, they don't have a easy way in and out of cash like Bitcoin, they don't have **name recognition** like Bitcoin does. People in these forms know of the alt's, but people on the streets **barely** know of Bitcoin, and out of the ones that have heard of Bitcoin, **never** heard of the alt's!
So the smart thing to do right now is sit tight, be patient, and wait for SegWit. It's looking like SegWit is going to go live with the August 1st UASF.... Or.... The miners will pull their heads out (of you know where) and start signaling **before** Aug 1st. (I'd rather see the miners signal.) But either way, we are getting SegWit.

I am running the Core Node v 0.14.1 which is the BIP148 version.
That means, I'm running the version that WILL start enforcing the SegWit rules on August 1st, 2017, if the miners don't activate SegWit before then.
I am...
* Signaling for SegWit with my mining
* Signaling for SegWit with my Full Node
* And my node WILL start enforcing the SegWit rules Aug 1st

Yes Intel could start to dominate. Or, the fight for dominance between Intel and Bitmain could last for decades. Or, while Intel and Bitmain are fighting it out, AMD could start to produce ASIC's.... And it could be a 3-way fight for dominance for a very long time.
And lets not forget that Bitfury is still in the business for producing ASIC's. Mabye they'll ramp up production while Bitmain, Intel, and AMD are going at it.

It **is not** what I want. These are extra steps merchants need to take to protect themselves, until SegWit is active and reduces transaction fees and confirmation times.
I am only offering solutions to the current issue at hand.
A merchant **might** find these steps necessary until SegWit goes live Aug 1st by way of UASF. Or sooner, if the miners start signaling for SegWit before that.

Yes, you are right. 0.14.1 is not actually Core's software. It's Core's 0.14.0 with UASF(BIP148) added. But Core is going to be supporting BIP148. New release coming out soon.

OK.... Now we're on the same page.
Sure, there was no such issue during the last halving, BUT WOW, it was a different bitcoin back then.
The last halving happened in Nov 2012. I didn't get into bitcoin until Apr 2013, so I wasn't around last time. But I do know bitcoin is A LOT BIGGER now! A lot more users and a lot more miners and TONS more mining power. Not to mention the cost of all that mining power. Were these huge mining farms around in 2013? If there were, I'm sure they would have been smaller and a lot less of them.
Going from 50 to 25 bitcoin reward must have been a major blow to miners back in 2013. But I think the profit margin was a little bigger back then. Making it easier to absorb the reduction.
With profit margins tighter, and these massive mining farms, I think the network is a little more volatile. If 2 or 3 of these massive farms become unprofitable and shut down operations at or near the same time, a lot of people are going to wish the difficulty was adjusted everyday, averaging the previous 2 weeks. (or maybe even 1 week)

OMG.... At this point, how can anyone still believe this?!?!?! Why don't people who don't know what they are talking about, STFU?!?!?!
**SegWit is a block capacity/size increase.**
Since old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data. New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. **Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB**, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB).
But when they add Schnorr Signatures later, the blocks will be closer 3 to 3.8 MB.

If Bitcoin continues to lose market share 'til it crashes and burns, it won't crash and burn because of people like me who think HF are too risky... It will be because of the people (mostly the miners) who are blocking SegWit.
There is **nothing wrong** with SegWit. It is the best solution to the scaling issue. There are no good reason why we shouldn't activate SegWit now. See how the mempool, transaction fees, and confirmation times respond. Then take more action later when needed. To **promise** to do a **risky hard fork** within 12 months, when a hard fork might not be needed, is asinine.
SegWit is everything we need right now.
* SegWit is **NOT** risky like hard forks
* SegWit is a soft fork
* SegWit **IS** a block size increase
* SegWit is a malleability fix
* SegWit allows for layers like the Lightening Network
There are only two reasons to be against SegWit....
* 1) You to not want Bitcoin to scale. You want it to fail, crash, and burn to the ground.
* 2) You do not want to lose your Covert ASICboost advantage.
I don't think the miners who are against SegWit agree with reason 1. Which means it has got to be reason 2.
The miners don't want BU. They know it's crap. The miners are using BU as a distraction form the real issue. The real issue is... **They are using Covert ASICboost!** They're trying to delay SegWit for as long as they can because they don't want to lose their Covert ASICboost advantage.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:15:14
Once again.... For the mentally challenged.... This is a temporary issue until SegWit and LN get in.
And what about credit cards?!?!?!?! People use credit cards a lot. I've never seen anyone get ID'd for cash. But over certain amounts, I see credit card customers get ID'd all the time!!! Is that "absolutely delusional" to show ID when buying a $200 TV???
You need to **actually** use your brain a little when accepting bitcoin.
I would sell you, **a stranger**, my car for **$10,000** in bitcoin and hand you the keys and watch you drive off, **with ZERO confirmations**!!!
I would.....
* Have you attach a $40 transaction fee or higher
* Get your current valid Driver's License so I can fill out the pink slip
* I would check to confirm the attached fee was at least $40
* I'd tell you "OK, here's the keys. You can sit and wait with me for a confirmation, or, you can drive off... It's up to you. But if I don't get a confirmation within 2 hours, I'm calling the police to reporting the car stolen."
@_date: 2016-05-17 23:13:55
I don't know how you came up with that 50% max number. Personally, I don't think a lot of miners will shut their equipment off all at once. I think most will leave their hardware running as long as they can, hoping for a major price increase soon.
I think the big mining farms will be able to hold on the longest. And of course.... The longer you can hold on while others are dropping off, the better off you are. With miners dropping off with high electric bill (making the difficulty drop), and the price of bitcoins going up because of less supply, the big mining farms should rake in the profits.
But what I think will happen, and what will happen, are probably two different things. While I think only small amounts of miners will shut down here-and-there and a little more as time goes on, I would never say a 50% shut down is a "worse case scenario."
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:38:42
The SegWit+2MB plan is not a good plan Mr. Voorhees (if you're seeing this)
The mempool backlog is a growing cancer inside of Bitcoin. It's responsible for higher transaction fees and longer wait times for confirmations.
SegWit is the much safer (SoftFork) medicine just released by the FDA (Core) that will likely shrink this growing tumor.
The 2MB HardFork is a much more dangerous surgery to cut out the tumor. But this is a very risky operation.
If SegWit is likely to shrink tumor, why promise to do the risky operation within 6 months?!?!?!
Take the medicine (SegWit) which is much safer, then wait 6 to 12 months to see how much the tumor shrinks. If the tumor hasn't gone **way down**, and there are no other safe options at that point, **then do the risky operation**.
But to promise to do the risky operation, before we know if the medicine will work or not, **is just wrong!!!!**
What if SegWit works, and **it shrinks the tumor to almost nothing**?!!! But Core promised to do a 2MB HardFork within 6 months. Now Core has to perform an **unneeded risky operation**, or lose credibility by breaking their promise.
To agree to SegWit now and a 2MB HardFork within 6 months, is just a bad idea.

Confirmations are important when trading larger amounts of bitcoin, but small purchases like this?... It's ridiculous! It's a $3 BEER for crying out loud!!! Do you know how much it costs that restaurant to pour that beer? Well under a dollar, that's for sure.
This is just like the "Can Bitcoin be used to buy a cup of coffee?" question. **It's a frickin cup of coffee!!!!** Sure, the coffee house sells it for $4.50, but it cost them about $0.50 to make.
**Can** you do a double spend and **ripoff** the coffee shop? YES! But.... Coffee shops take cash, yet they accept counterfeit bills by accident **everyday**.
Some people are bad, and they pass counterfeit bills. **But it's just a part of doing business.** This is why you pay $4.50 for that coffee instead of $4.45. We all have to pay a little more for the  who ripoff shops.
So.... Dollar bills can be (and are) counterfeited, so why do coffee shops accept them?!?!?!?!.... Because the **vast majority** of people are honest. They just want to pay for the coffee and go to school or work. And it will be the same for using Bitcoin.
When you can find a way to eliminate counterfeit bills 100%, I'll show you how to eliminate a bitcoin double spend 100% of the time. It can't be done. It's just part of doing business.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:19:59
Yes. But I'm trying to deal with the bitcoin network as it is today.
And opening a channel in the LN still takes confirmations (I'm not sure how many, maybe 1 to 3.). And you'd have to wait for those. 
But if SegWit and LN were active and a channel was opened ahead of time.... Yep! Instant (and very cheap) transactions. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:07:02
Well... I feel the opposite of you my friend.
With all the issues that could arise on Aug 1st, I feel it's OK for Coinbase to suspend withdraws until the dust settles. They are only trying to avoid issues and confusion. And, they gave proper warning so you could pull your funds out ahead of time if you so choose.
But I see the BCC Hard Fork solely as an attempt to create confusion and undermine confidence in Bitcoin, and NOT to make a better Bitcoin. I wouldn't have a problem with Coinbase offering BTU as an option. BTU would be a fork of what the BU people believe is the best way to go. That's a completely different motivation than BCC. BCC should not be supported by any exchange.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:04:25
Your transaction is safe and just fine in the mempool for the moment.
The maximum time a transaction will stay in the mempool was changed earlier this year from 3 days to 2 weeks. So you still have 11 days for it to clear.
The miner's fee (0.000762) associated with this transaction is not all that low. I had a transaction a couple of weeks ago with fee of 0.00005. The mempool was backed up about 25megs. Over the next couple of days, the mempool went up to 75megs. Of course, the transaction didn't clear during this time. A few days later the mempool got down to 5megs and the transaction went though. It took a little over 5 days, but it did make it into a block just fine.
But remember.... My transaction had a **0.00005** fee. Yours has a **0.000762**. Your fee is a lot more. My best guess would be.... You need the mempool to get down to the low 20's megs (maybe the high teens) for it to clear. What are the odds of this happening before your 2 weeks are up???..... I'm not sure. I think, pretty good.
So sit back, grab a beer, and wait. It could clear in the next day or two, but you still have 11 days left.
Do you want to help fix this mempool backlog issue????.... Support SegWit. SegWit will allow ~twice as many transaction into each block after it goes live. A few months later they will add compression, which will allow up to 3 or 4 times as many transactions into each block. Not to mention, it will allow for the Lightening Network, which will take even more pressure off the mempool. Then we'll be back to 4 to 12 cents fees, and 1 confirmation within 10 to 15 minutes.
And lets not forget about RSK. RSK should go live late June or July. RSK will give us very low fees, 400 transactions per second (right now the network can handle about 3 to 7 per second), 1 confirmation in about 10 seconds, AND Ethereum "like" smart contracts. (**TIP:** Start selling your Ethereum now.)
About 6 months later, RSK will add Lumino Compression, which will change the 400 transactions per second to 2,500 transactions per second.
So.... Be patient. Yes, high fees and long confirmations majorly **suck** right now. But **GREAT** things are coming. The miners need to **see the light** and start signaling for SegWit.
I'm still mining signaling for SegWit.
I'm running a Full Node signaling for SegWit.
Oh... Did I mention... RSK can to live **with or without** SegWit. It's a sidechain to Bitcoin. All it needs is Bitcoin running and miners to dual mine. This means.... They can

I wouldn't say it's "centralized". I'd say it's more centralized than it was 3 years ago. And it's probably a little more centralized than it should be at the moment.
But this is because of the centralization of the manufacturing of the ASIC chips, and the chip's major speed increases over the past years. But in the past couple of yearsm the speed increases have been slowing down. They have caught up to current technologies, and this will help to level the play field over the next few years. Also, Intel is talking about getting into making mining chips. If they do, it will help level the playing field faster.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:46:51
From what I understand, they've added NOTHING so far to change the blocksize. They're saving that for later. They're only working on adding BIP91 and other code to get SegWit in before BIP148 does, so they can say they did it.
But there's NO WAY there should be "Satoshi" in the name. Should be SW+2x 1.14.3, or something like that.

Yep, very shady group this Bitclub.
But they were mining YES for SegWit since last year, until about a month ago. Why did they switch to NO for SegWit?
They also stopped accepting new accounts into their "club" from the USA. And if you currently have an account and live in the USA, they recommend removing all funds and closing the account, or risk losing the funds.
So Bitclub (a cloud mining service mixed with MLM) stopped doing business in the USA and stopped signaling for SegWit shortly before Roger Ver announced that he is starting up a cloud mining service.

Maybe, in the short term an without taking the extra steps pointed you above.


I'm **not** acting like it's normal. I keep saying *It's temporary!*
Bitcoin has been having this issue for a little more than a year, when it's 8 and a half years old. Does that sound "normal" to you?... Not to me.
* Is this normal? NO
* Is it temporary? YES
* Has it been going on for too long? YES
* Will it be solved soon? HOPEFULLY
It will be solved with a UASF Aug 1st, or a MASF sooner if the miners start signaling for SegWit.

If you're a coffee shop selling $0.50 worth of coffee for $4.50 and once in a while you get double spent, **who cares!** It's 50 cents.
If you're a bicycle shop selling a bike for $200, you... 
* If customer wants to by with Bitcoin, inform customer to include a health miner fee
* Accept the Bitcoin transaction. (now the clock is ticking)
* Check transaction details to confirm healthy miner fee
* Input customer's data into your data base. (name, home address, phone, email address)
* Ask for Driver's License. Make sure it's current and matches the address they gave you. Input DL number (If legal in your state)
* Perform safety check on bike. Make sure bolts are tight and chain oiled
* Review safety tips with customer
By now, 15 to 20 minutes have passed and you should have a confirmation (if SegWit is in place). Help customer load bike into car and wave bye!
If, for some reason, there isn't 1 confirmation at this time, help customer load bike into car anyway. You have all of the customer's current info to track them down if needed. Just like accepting a check, and the check bounces. 
If customer refuses to reveal home address or Driver's License, say "That's OK. But we must wait for 1 confirmation **before** this bike leaves the shop."
People keep forgetting.... Businesses have been accepting check for many **decades**. Yet sometimes checks bounce. And if a check bounces, the business doesn't know it bounced for 1 or 2 weeks! This is why when you pay with a check, the business will check the address on the check with the address on a current Driver's License, and make sure there's a phone number. Does this guarantee the business will eventually get it's money?.. No. But it greatly improves the odds.

All of the solutions to fix the scaling issue are bandaids. It's just that SegWit is THE BEST bandaid!!!
Think of Bitcoin scaling like scaling the internet from the 90's. In the 90's you could up and download MP3 files to play music on your computer, but the internet wasn't fast enough to stream music. And back then they said "*The internet is as fast as it will ever be. We'll never be able to stream music!!*" Then, around the year 2000 the internet got some upgrades and we were able to stream music. And they said "*The internet is as fast as it will ever be. We can stream music, but we'll never be able to stream video!!!*" Then some years later we could stream some really ugly video. Then later, broadcast quality video. Then later, HD quality video. And now, 4K video.
In short.... The internet has always struggled to keep up with demand. And Bitcoin will probably always be the same way.
So the question is "*What is THE BEST solution for Bitcoin to keep up with demand right now?*" The answer: SegWit
* Shortly after SegWit activates, blocks will start to grow to about 2megs.
* The Lightning Network will go LIVE shortly after SegWit activates, which can handle 100,000 transactions per second and has INSTANT confirmations.
* Towards the end of this year Schnorr Signatures will be added, making blocks 3+megs.
Right now we can fit about 2,200 transactions per block. With just SegWit and Schnorr Signatures we'll be able to fit over 6,000 transactions per block. All thanks to SegWit.
There are all sorts of sidechains, drivechains, and layers planned for Bitcoin that will help with the scaling issue. You don't hear about them because of all the noise out there about SegWit or SegWit2x or BTU, and now BCC.
The Bitcoin Core Developers are the best in the space! They know Bitcoin inside and out, right down to each line of code. Until you know the code better than them, put your trust in them. They HAVE ALWAYS done what's best for Bitcoin. I wouldn't trust my coins to any other developer team.
The Bitcoin Core Developers say SegWit is currently the best way forward. Guess what?.... SegWit is the best way forward.
When Core says it's time for a 2x Hard Fork. That's when Bitcoins needs a 2x Hard Fork.

Come on now.... It's not Dec 2016.
The amount of SegWit transactions per block was a concern late 2016 and early 2017. Now, the wallets have had plenty of time to add SegWit transactions and are only waiting to SegWit to active. If SegWit were to lock in today, most transactions would be SegWit transactions by the time it activated. Shortly after that, the vast majority of transactions would be SegWit transactions.

It is **all too clear to me** that everyone is **not** on my side. If they were, we would have had SegWit activated in Nov 2016.
And your statement... "*Or, miners could just keep mining the current rules of Bitcoin. A rather glaring omission from your accounting of possible outcomes.*" I did account for....
I said "*the miners will have to switch to SegWit rules or risk mining without getting the reward.*" So you see, miners can **not** keep mining with the current rules. Although SegWit is backwards compatible, BIP148 **will not** accept blocks mined with the current rules. Miners will have to mine with SegWit rules or risk their blocks getting orphaned.
And although everyone is not on my side, **the majority** of the nodes **are** on my side.
Current node stats are...
* Nodes running Core = 88% of all nodes
* Nodes running 0.14.1 (BIP148) = 31% of all nodes
* Nodes running BU = 9.5% of all nodes
0.14.1 (BIP148) was just released a week or 2 ago and it's already the  version of Core Node Software. I guess we'll see what the percentage is on August 1st.
BIP148 won't matter at all if the miners activate SegWit before the deadline. I'd rather see this happen. A MASF is a little safer than a UASF, so I hope the miners start coming around.
BitClub Network Pool just switch back to signaling for SegWit a couple of hours ago. Maybe more will switch by early July.

I know how mining works, I've been mining since Jan 2014. I know how some pools start mining empty blocks so they can start mining before the new block propagates to them. And I know AntPool is the biggest pool. But proportionally, this happens way more to AntPool than it should. They mine way more empty blocks, and blocks that are 1/4 or 1/3 full when there are plenty of transactions left in the mempool.
It's happening so much, it looks to me as if they not filling blocks on purpose so the mempool's backlog of transactions grows bigger, so transaction fees will grow bigger.

I don't know where you're getting your node count from, but I think you're getting an old number.

You shouldn't trust anyone helping you with this, unless it's a paid lawyer. Too many people talk without knowing what the heck they're talking about. The laws dealing with bitcoin right now are shaky and dynamic to say the least. Some states are defining bitcoin as a commodity, some are saying it's a currency, and others are calling it property. Some want to tax it. some don't. Some have banned it, and then they reversed the ban.
This make it REALLY hard to start a bitcoin business (I've thought of doing it too). To find out what all the laws are in your state, county, and city, and then invest all the funds needed to start the business only to have the state, county, or city change the law weeks or months later. Now you might have to make major changes to your business, or maybe even shut down.

And BTC did solve these problems **before** the block size issue. And it will solve them again **after** the block size issue is resolved.
Support SegWit. We are getting SegWit one way or another. If the miners don't support SegWit before Aug 1st, the UASF will kick in and we'll get SegWit anyway. Then we'll be back to much lower fees and much short wait times for 1 confirmation.

Yes! I'm running a Full Node on a PI 3 with a 32GB mircoSD card. I used the "prune" setting to prune the blockchain down to the last 1024megs (about 1 gigabyte) worth of blocks. But it's still storing, validating, and sharing the last ~1,000 blocks. This is still considered a Full Validating Node.
But with your 256GB microSD card, you won't need to prune. Not for a year or two.
I recommend you follow this tutorial. This one will make sure you install the latest version that has full support for BIP148 (assuming you support BIP148).
When you're done with that tutorial, but before you run bitcoind for the first time, follow this tutorial to properly create a swapfile, AND, only use it when needed to extend the life of your microSD card....
To set up a swapfile, perform the following commands. 4 GB RAM for a Bitcoin node should be more than fine, so given the Pi's 1 GB RAM, you can set up the swapfile to 3 GB:
sudo fallocate -l 3G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo nano /etc/fstab
The last command will open the settings file for partitions to be mounted at boot. Scroll down to the end and add the following line, then Ctrl-X, then Enter to save and exit the editor:
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
Also, to let the system only use the swapfile if really necessary, open the following file in nano by performing:
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
In the end of the file, add the following line:

Yes... I see your point. But maybe it could be a feature of the wallet that could be turned on or off. This way, if you understand what's going on, you could turn it on and feel better about a small transaction (with a GREEN flag) before there is 1 confirmation.
The pain is.... Sometimes those 10 minute average confirmations can take 30 or 40 minutes. The longest I've seen is 93 minutes. That's a long time to wait for ONE confirmation. But if that transaction had the GREEN flag, I would have said "OK, we're good" just as soon as I saw the transaction come in.

**SegWit has NOT failed.**
Lets say you're in a math class in high school. You're given a test that should take you an hour to complete. Is it fair to take the test from you 30 minutes later, when you're about half done, and give you an F for getting 50% of the questions correct???? **NO!**
SegWit was giving **one year** to activate. Let's give it that one year. If it hasn't activated by Nov 2017, then you can say it failed.
But why?.... Why does it have such little miner support so far? (Currently at 33%)
* Because SegWit is a risky hard fork? **No. It's a soft fork.**
* Because SegWit isn't a block size increase? **No. SegWit is a block size increase.**
* Because SegWit doesn't fix malleability? **No. SegWit does fix the malleability issue.**
* Because BU is a better way forward? **HELL NO! BU is a joke, and the miners are only using BU as a distraction from the real issue.**
The real issue is.... Some of the miners are using Covert ASICboost to increase their profits. SegWit will take this advantage away from them. SegWit breaks Covert ASICboost because it changes the block structure. They don't want to lose their 20 to 30% advantage, so they are delaying SegWit for as long as they can.
As long as Bitcoin keeps growing. The price keeps going UP. Transaction fees keep going UP. These miners have no incentive to support SegWit, because they are short sighted. They don't want to lose some of their profits today, for a better Bitcoin tomorrow. They only seem to care about their profits today.
So don't blame me for not wanting to "compromise"... To do a risky hard fork, when one might not even be needed. Blame the miners not supporting SegWit because they don't want to lose a 20 to 30% reduction in their electric bill.
* These miners are the ones who **want** a mempool backlog.
* These miners are the ones who **what** high transactions fees.
* These miners are the ones who **want** long confirmation times.
* These miners are the ones who are **holding Bitcoin back**, stalling SegWit, blocking Bitcoin from improving. 
These miners don't want **BU**, and they don't want **bigger blocks**. They know SegWit is the best way forward, they just can't seem to let go of their 20 to 30% discount on their electric bill.
My best guess is.... They will continue to delay SegWit right up to Oct or Nov. At that time, I it's a 50/50 bet they'll switch to support SegWit. Or..... If people keep dumping more and more into altcoins, and the price of Bitcoin really drops, then they could start supporting SegWit. And when they do..... It will be **The Great Altcoin DUMP!!!** All this money will flow back into Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin price will..... Go to the moon!
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:59:58
I'm not sure why they did this. Probably because the mempool was backing up so much that too many transactions were dropping out. They wanted to give them more time to go through. Maybe they'll change it back to 3 days after SegWit is activated.
Once SegWit is activated, Lightening Network goes live, and RSK is running.... They could change it to 24 hours. (Maybe even 12 hours.) With these three things active, I don't see the mempool backing up much at all, even with major growth, for at least 5 years.
SegWit will ~double the transactions per second.
LN (Layer on top of Bitcoin / SegWit needed) will allow for micro transactions (with extremely small fees), about 100,000 per second.
RSK (Side chain to Bitcoin / SegWit **not** needed) will allow for 400 transactions per second until they add Lumino Compression, then they think it will go up to about 2.5K transactions per second. (Expected to go live in June or July 2017.)
RSK will also add Ethereum "like" contracts to Bitcoin. (Look out Ethereum!) Yo might want to sell Ethereum before RSK goes live.

Since you're new to the space, I recommend you stop watching The Future of Bitcoin YouTube channel. That channel is mostly lies, half truths, and misinformation about Bitcoin and SegWit, trying to promote things like BTU (Bitcoin Unlimited) and SegWit2x Agreement (which is total nonsense).
SegWit is the MOST tested Bitcoin upgrade since Bitcoin started. SegWit has been running on the Bitcoin Test Network for almost 2 years, and it's been running on the Litecoin Main Network for months. SegWit has been FULLY TESTED and is READY TO GO! It just needs to be activated.
It looks like we're finally getting SegWit.
* SegWit should get locked-in around August 9th.
* Then there will be a 2 week (2016 block) grace period.
* SegWit should be LIVE sometime around August 21th thru August 24th.

No... It does NOT "require" to hold in fiat/alts. This post was about hodling long term. If you're already hodling long term, you probably already have a decent amount of bitcoin. But why not add a little here and there when you have the fiat and price dips?
On June 11th, the price was $3,000. That was one month ago. If you're able to save maybe $100 a week, you would have had $400 saved up for today when the price was $2,250.
Now maybe you think it's just better to buy $100 every week no matter the price. For me.... As long as the price is under $5,000, I have no problem with a weekly buy. I still think we are gong to have a $10,000 bitcoin by the end of 2020. So by then, any buy under $5,000 is going to seem pretty sweet.
Not everyone has a large some of money just sitting around to invest. Some can only spare $50 to $100 a week. But whether you want to simply buy every week no matter the price, or save every week waiting for the next dip, is up to the person. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method.
I've been watching the price pretty close for 4 years, and it's pretty easy to look up the price history.... There are always dips.
The only question is.... How big will the dip be?

The UASF will **only** go into effect if less than 95% of the blocks mined don't signal for SegWit by early July. After mid July, it will be too late for miners to switch.
If enough miners switch to signaling for SegWit before early July, just like BitClub Network Pool did, then **the miner** will activate SegWit, and there will be no UASF (BIP148).
If enough miners don't switch by early July, then the UASF will kick in August 1st. At this point, the miners will have to switch to SegWit rules or risk mining without getting the reward. Their blocks will be orphaned, or they go mine an alt coin like Bitcoin Unlimited. Which I doubt they'll do since the user support for BU is extremely low.

Jihan needs to know that Bitcoin has to scale. The more people using Bitcoin, the better for Bitcoin and the better for miners.
He shouldn't be thinking about the **fee per transaction**. He should be thinking about the **total transaction fees per block**!
Although, SegWit will make transaction fees go down, Jihan will be able to fit ~twice as many transactions per block. And after Schnorr Signatures get added, Jihan will be able to fit almost 3 times as many transactions per block. Again.... Making the transactions fees per block about the same as they are now.
Jihan just has to **stop mining empty blocks**, and he'll be making about the same on transaction fees per block, and the users will get a break on transaction fees.... It's a win-win.

If you're only planning on running a node 24/7 until this SegWit and scaling issue is settled, then you can use your main computer, or any old desktop/laptop computer you have laying around.
Depending on the computer you use and the cost of your electricity, running the computer 24/7 could cost you between $15 and $25 a month on your electric bill. Not too bad if you're only planning on doing it for a few months or less.
But if you continue to run the node, this monthly electric bill will start to add up.
I started running a node 4 months ago, and I'm not planning on stopping. So I got myself a Raspberry Pi 3. It's only pulling 1 watt, so it's costing me about 15 cents of electricity a month.
Once it's all set up, you only need the power cable and networking cable plugged into it. I use the "prune 1024" setting to prune the blockchain down so that the OS, node software, and the blockchain all fit onto the 32GB mircoSD card, with plenty of room to spare. This way, you don't need a USB hard drive plugged in or even a USB flash drive. Both of which would pull more watts.

Yet the fact remains.... SegWit is a blocksize increase. And what Jihan is actually saying is... "I want a blocksize increase and a blocksize increase!"
So maybe **you** can tell me.... Why would he want a Double Blocksize Increase, when AntPool (the mining pool owned by the company he co-founded) **isn't filling the blocks at the current size!!!!**
[Look at this block]( mined by AntPool. They created a block that's 225kb, when they could have filled that block all the way to 1mb.
So he want's blocks 4meg or bigger, but his company doesn't even fill a 1meg block?!?! This screenshot was from a few minutes ago, but I saw them do this about half a dozen times today. Each time, they could have filled the block, but they didn't.... But he wants blocks 4 times bigger? Why??? 
@_date: 2016-05-18 05:59:59
I like your strategy to wait until after the first difficulty change after the halving to start mining again. Makes sense.
But I have sort of a unique situation.
I moved my miners to a friend's house who has tons of solar panels. He produces a lot more electricity than he uses, so he's letting me mine there for half of whatever I mine. This is A LOT better deal than me mining at home.
So it doesn't matter to me how much or how little bitcoin I mine. I just pay half of whatever I make to pay for electricity.

I transfer BTC to friends and family all the time with a .00005 per K miner fee (most are less than 1 K). MOST of the time the transactions make it into the next block. Sometimes I have to wait an extra block or two, but that's pretty rare.
Hang in there Yodan... Your transaction should go through.
Thunder Network (in alpha testing) will fix all of these types of issues. Once you stake some BTC, you'll have even cheaper transaction fees and near instant confirmations. If Thunder Network makes it through alpha and beta testing and into BTC, the blocksize debate will be over.

This is very unfortunate... And you have Roger and Jihan to thank for it, because they've been delaying SegWit. If SegWit would have went live earlier this year, this transaction would have never costs this much.
But this is a very LARGE transaction. Not large in the value amount, but large in the amount of inputs (101) to pay the output.
I don't know what wallet you used, but your wallet paid 146 Satoshis per byte, and your transaction was 14,936 bytes!!!! A typical transaction is under 300 bytes.
Some wallets allow you to change the amount to pay per byte. If you could have changes this amount to 1 Satoshi per byte, the miner's fee would have been about 38 cents and you probably would have had the first confirmation in a few hours. If you set the wallet to pay 2 Satoshis per byte, you would have paid 74 cents to send the funds and you probably would have received the first confirmation within an hour.
Bitcoin wallets need some work. They shouldn't list fees in Satoshis per byte to the user, because you don't know how many bytes the transaction will take up. They should suggest 3 or 4 different TOTAL fee amounts, then let you pick one or input your own fee manually.
Most miners don't care how much space a transaction takes up. They only care about the total transaction fee.
A transaction with ~100 inputs and a total fee of 30 to 80 cents will get pick up by a miner pretty quick the past week or so. And if you're worried about it, attach a $1 or $2 fee. NO NEED to send a $56 fee.
But the wallets must make the total fee easily adjustable. The best wallet I found for letting you adjust the fees is Electrum. But I use an Electrum computer wallet. I don't use Electrum on my phone, so I don't know if it's different.

It is not nonsense. The mempool almost always has a backlog, which means all blocks should be full, and we need bigger blocks.
SegWit will give us BIGGER blocks, on chain. 1.6x to 2.1x at first. And 3x to 3.8x after Schnorr Signatures are added later. A simple 2xHF would never give you 3x to 3.8, ever!
SegWit is also a malleability fix. SegWit also allows for adding laying so things like the Lightning Network can be added. Which has instant confirmations and extremely small transaction fees (there's using bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee). Does a 2xHF fix malleability and allow for layering?... Ummm... NO and NO!
There's only one path forward that makes any sense at all...  SegWit NOW, 2megHF if and when it's needed.
To "promise" a risky 2megHF within 6 months, when there's a good chance it won't be needed by that time.... Now there's some **real nonsense!!!**

Like I said... If you're already hodling a decent about of Bitcoin long term, the amount of fiat you're saving up isn't significant.
As for how big the dip will be?..... Only time will tell.
Once the price drops 2 or 3 hundred, use all of what you've been saving to add to your Bitcoin Long Term Hodling.... Or, if you think it might go even 1 or 2 hundred lower, only add 50% of what you've been saving, then put in the other 50% in when it drops further.
Or buy every week not matter the price. I have to problem with that strategy. Hard to say which is better.
I plan on hodling until it reaches $10,000. And then only sell a little at a time. So for me, ANY price under $5,000 is good with me. This way, I will at least double my money.

According to my calculations, with a $10 difference between exchanges, with $650 on one and $640 on the other, for a $9 transaction, there's only a 0.14 USD difference. That's a little more than I would have guessed, but not too bad.
The only way around this that I can see, is if it somehow became the standard to use bitcoinaverage.com as the bitcoin value when making a retail purchase. Of course, when buying or selling bitcoin at an exchange, it would be the current price at that exchange.
This way, we'd have one set price for all purchases, and buying or selling at an exchange would be like buying or selling coins at a coin shop. You can go buy some old, rare, penny from a coin shop for 0.10 USD, but you can always spend it as just one penny.

I'm not "afraid" of anything. I'm concerned that BCC will cause confusion and doubt about Bitcoin... And was the sole purpose for it's creation.
And yes... I believe SegWit will be a major relief to Bitcoin scaling issues. SegWit is a blocksize increase, which will help keep the backlog in the mempool to a minimum. SegWit makes it easier to add layers like the Lightning Network, which will also relieve pressure from the mempool. And Schnorr Signatures (due out late 2017) will turn SegWit's ~2meg blocksize into 3+megs.
How long will SegWit be the only solution needed to scale Bitcoin???.... Who knows?... But we are going to find out soon.
Maybe we'll need a 2xHF in 3 months, 9 months, or 4 years. But there's no way a 2xHF should be planed when at this time there's a very good chance a 2xHF won't be needed any time soon.
To me, there's only one way to proceed forward... SegWit ASAP (which seems to be happening). Then see how things go. And a 2xHF when needed.

But Coinbase is really beginning to get on my nerves. They are really pushing KYC to the limits. They wanted lots of my info to open the account. Then they wanted more for a little higher limits. And now they want even MORE (work title and name of employer) because I've been labelled a "High Volume Account". High Volume Account???.... Really???.... I buy 1 or 2 (sometimes 3) bitcoins maybe once a month. Always under $1,500 USD per transaction.
I feel like, if I give them this information, the next thing they will ask for is a blood sample for my DNA.
Averaging 1 transaction per month, always under $1,500 USD is a High Volume Account?!?!?!?

There use to be one for $1,000. But it wasn't really an ATM (or BTM). It was more like a vending machine because you could only buy bitcoin in it. You couldn't sell bitcoin to it.
But the company that made it went out of business about a year after starting up. Probably because of laws and regulations.
I think.... Even though it only sold bitcoin and didn't buy bitcoin, it was still a money transfer so it had to be AML/KYC compliant.
But again, when it comes to bitcoin, the laws and regulations are in a very grey area. Law enforcement and courts really haven't figured out how to deal with or classify bitcoin yet.

I have been mining for over 3 years. I caught the tail end of when you can actually mine at home (without a major operation in the basement) and make money. Then I sold an old hot tub to fund a solar panel project, and that helped with electricity costs for another year or so. But for the past year it's been a losing proposition, IF I was still mining at home, but I'm not.
For the past year I have had a unique situation with a friend who has TONS of solar panels on his property. WAY more the little system I built. So I moved my mining hardware to his house and pay him extremely little for his electricity.
Without this unique situation, the home miner just can't compete with the mining farms in China and Iceland. The electricity is just too cheap there. And all of the hardware they have drives UP the difficulty, making it nearly impossible for the home miner to make any money.
If you're interested in mining at home, you could do it just for ability to say "I'm a bitcoin miner." Get a small, quiet unit (like the old USB miners). Use a Raspberry Pi to control it. And just have it running in your living room as a conversational piece. You'll NEVER make in bitcoin what you pay for the setup. But you can say you're a miner, and everyone who comes over will say "What's that?"

How do you know he sent to you twice? Are you seeing 2 transactions in your wallet, but only 1 of them has confirmations?
If you are seeing 2 transactions but only 1 of them is confirming, he could have done a double spend on the second one. He could have done a double spend on both of them, but the first double spend didn't work and the second one did.
I don't know what you sold, or for how much... But if it's more than a few bucks, ALWAYS wait for 1 confirmation before handing over whatever you're selling. And if you're receiving multiple payments for an item, make sure each payment has at least 1 confirmation.
If they guy is on the up-and-up, he might have sent 2 payment because he had bitcoin on 2 different wallets. One of the wallets might have been set to a good (medium to high) transaction fee, and the other set very low or zero. This means it might take a day or 2, or 3, for the confirmations to start coming in. But you should get it.

Here you go...
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:28:00
You are **not** out of luck.
Coinbase use to pay the transaction fee for transferring bitcoin out of your Coinbase account, they no longer do that. Now, you have to pay the fee, and I believe they control what the fee is (It's been a long time since I transferred bitcoin out of Coinbase so I'm not sure of their protocol at the moment).
So, if you have 0.008 bitcoin in your wallet, and you want to transfer out 0.008 bitcoin, that leaves zero bitcoin left over to pay the miner's fee.
What you need to do is buy more bitcoin! Buy another $25, $50, $100, worth of bitcoin from Coinbase. Download and install **your own wallet on your own computer or phone**! Your Coinbase wallet should only be used to buy/sell bitcoin, not to hold bitcoin or make purchases. Use you own wallet to hold and spend, hold your own keys! If you don't hold the keys, you don't really own the bitcoin!
If you're installing a wallet on your computer, I recommend Electrum. **Very** flexible when it comes to the user picking the transaction fee.
If you're installing a wallet on your cell phone, I recommend Mycelium. **Somewhat** flexible when it comes to the user picking the transaction fee.
Now that you have your own wallet installed **and backed up**, transfer all bitcoins out of Coinbase into your wallet.
* On your computer wallet, go to the "receive" tab and click the "copy address" button. Then go to your Coinbase account and click "send". Paste the address into the send field. Then click "use max" to send the maximum amount after fees. And click "send funds" to send. Now you have all your bitcoins on your own wallet where you control the keys and the transaction fees.
* If you installed Mycelium on your phone, there's a little different process. You need to get a Mycelium address on your phone to your computer so you can paste it into the Coinbase webpage. Bring up your Mycelium wallet. Tap "receive". Tap "copy to clipboard". Go to texting and tap whatever icon you have to start a new text. For the receiving phone number, input your email address (**Yes, you can send a text to an email address.** Or if you have emailing on your phone past the address into a email and send it to yourself.) Now "tap and hold" where you would normally type a text until the word "paste" pops up. Let go, then tap "paste". Then tap "send". Now go to your email on your computer. You should have an email with the Mycelium address in it. Highlight the address and right-click the mouse and select "copy". Now go to your Coinbase account and follow the directions above (from the computer wallet section) to send the Coinbase bitcoins to your phone's Mycelium wallet.
And that's it. Now you have your own bitcoins, in your own wallet, holding your own keys, with a lot more control of the miner's fee.
Spend you bitcoins anyway you see fit.

"a bit inaccurate"???? It was about half inaccurate. It can be printed (in a way), it's called a "Paper Wallet". I printed some last week. And the blocks are called "blocks". And when a miner solves a block, he gets a reward.
Wow Jeopardy.... You messed that one up.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:58:17


As far as I know, this code is still be worked on. But that's not to say there isn't some version out which can still give them a very good idea on the compression ratio and how much space it will free up in the block. But then they give a pretty wide range for the resulting blocksize... 3 to 3.8megs. This is because there's no way to know exactly how many multi-sig transactions will be in any given block. And of course, when you're compressing signatures, multi-sig transactions result in more data that you can compress.


So now **you're telling me** that they are only starting to work on Schnorr Signatures TODAY? Wow!... Ok... Well, I don't know exactly when this project started, but I've been hearing about it for at least 6 months. So I guess the question should be "Will this project be finished up and ready to go live in 7 months?" These are details I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are in a final testing stage now.


Seems like you need to go re-read my first post in this thread.
SegWit2x is SegWit + a 2meg HF. Why do them BOTH, when the much safer SF (SegWit alone) is VERY LIKELY to fix Bitcoin's scaling issues for years. Do you want a blocksize increase?.... Support SegWit! SegWit is a blocksize increase!!! 1.6 to 2megs as soon as it's active. Up to 3 or even 3.8megs later with Schnorr Signatures.
But why listen to me?!?!?!?!.... I'm just some nobody on Reddit. And who are you?.... Do you really believe you understand how Bitcoin works, and how to write the code BETTER than the core devs? So... What do the core devs think about SegWit2x????.....
Below is a link to a website that tracks what the core devs (and others) think about the different proposals. It's currently tracking 21 core devs. 4 devs have no commit on SegWit2x. But the other 17 give it a "NO" or a "LOL" (and LOL isn't even one of the standard answers)!!!! **No other proposal has so many NO's and LOL's as SegWit2x!!!** OK, so you're smarter than me?.... Sure, maybe. But you knowing better than the best and brightest minds working on the Bitcoin code???? I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT ONE!!!! With so many devs thinking so little of putting SegWit together with a 2xHF.... **It has got to be one colossal bad idea!!!**

I wouldn't say that. I'd say backwards compatibility is **ONE** of the main reasons for wanting a SF over a HF.
The other main reason being the ease of upgrading the network. With a SF, the network (miners, nodes, wallets) can "ease" into the upgrade. With the miners, nodes, and wallets upgrading when they can. With a HF, the vast majority of network needs to switch all at once! MUCH HARDER upgrade to organize.

@_date: 2017-06-30 23:53:28


This is like saying... "Fuck the much safer SF SegWit Big Blocks... Much more risky HF Big Blocks are coming."  Ummm... Not too smart. 
Not to mention... SegWit also gives us a malleability fix, layering so we can add the Lightning Network, and after Schnorr Signatures are added, blocksizes up to 3.8mb.
Hello!!!.... Is this mic on?
I could understand the confusion back in late 2016, when all of this was very new. Even early 2017. But by now, if you can't see that SegWit is the much better option... Written, supported, and fully tested by 100+ Core Devs.... Developers who know and understand the code far better than anyone else... Then wow!!!! You're smarter than the 100+ Core Devs!!! The best and brightest in the space!!! You should start your own coin.

Thank you shermand100. This WinSCP sounds like it could be of GREAT help to me. I'm going to go check it out.
I did end up finding a tutorial that helped me upgrade my RPi3 Node to 0.14.1. And it's been running nonstop for just over a week now.


Well.... I'm a big SegWit supporter. The miners should have been signaling for this (at 95% or more) since early 2017. And the only reason they're not, is ASICboost (IMHO). And 0.14.1 just might be the incentive they need to start signaling. 0.14.1 supports BIP148. That's the main reason I wanted to go from 14.0 to 14.1.
I'm also mining in support of BIP148. Nodes running 0.14.1 does send a message to the miners that **the users** want SegWit. But your right.... What BIP148 needs is **hashing power**. 15 to 20% of the total network hashing power and BIP148 has a small chance working. 25 to 35%, and BIP148 has a very good chance of getting SegWit activated by November. Anything over 40%, and it's pretty much a "Done Deal".
The main hurdle is getting over 25% of the total network hashing power by Aug 7th or 8th. If this isn't met, I think BIP148 will fail. But who knows.... It might get to 35% by Aug 1st. That would be nice!!!
I don't know how all of this will play out. As we get closer to Aug 1st, I will be turning up (over clocking) my miners... That's for sure.
**VERY** exciting time in Bitcoin right now... Large amounts of newcomers are joining the space, the price is going up and up, and there's **finally** a chance we could be getting SegWit soon.
Store you bitcoins in a BIP148 compliant wallet, where **you** hold the keys, and **HODL!** Hold on tight... It's going to be a wild ride.

It is my understanding that 0.14.1 is Core's version 0.14.0 with BiP148 added by Luke Jr. And is not an official Core release.
0.14.2 is an official Core release, fixing some bug in 0.14.0 and maybe some small enhancements. But it does NOT have the BIP148 Luke Jr. put into 0.14.1.
Am I wrong?

To say that SegWit BIP141 is at 100%, is a bit misleading.
BIP91 is near 100%. But BIP91 looks at a much smaller block sample than BIP141.
BIP141 signaling looks at a 2016 block difficulty adjustment period. The current period started 1353 blocks ago, and is currently at 57.5% signaling for SegWit. This 2016 block period will NOT make it to 95% so it will not lock-in SegWit. This period should end on Thursday, July 27th, in the early morning hours (Pacific Time).
If this same signaling continues, the new 2016 block period starting on the 27th, should lock-in SegWit. This period will end around Aug 9th.
Then there will be a 2016 block period which will be a grace period. This grace period should end around Aug 22nd.
When this grace period is over, we'll have SegWit!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:22:29
SegWit is **the most tested and evaluated** update ever! They just didn't pull the 1.6 to 2meg, and 3 to 3.8meg numbers out of thin air. The real numbers should be **the same or at least very close**.
So lets activate it and see! We still need the malleability fix and layering anyway.
And if SegWit doesn't solve the scaling issue, **I'll stand right beside Roger Ver and bang the drum for 2xHF.**

Well.... The Schnorr Signature Compress has been tested too. As long as SegWit, no.... But long enough.
Once you know the average compress rate, the computations on how much space you're going to save in the block isn't all that hard to do. I'm confidant the 3 to 3.8meg estimate is going to be a good one.
I'd have to say your majorly underestimating SegWit. Don't forget.... SegWit allows for layering. So the Lightening Network can be added. Allowing for 100,000 transactions per second in the LN. **But that's just ONE layer.** More layers are coming that will help with scaling, which wouldn't be possible without SegWit. You're being very short sighted. SegWit **opens so many doors!!!** That would be closed with it.
* So.... The much safer SF option (SegWit), that will facilitate so many new things in Bitcoin, 1.6meg to 3.8meg blocks, and fix malleability, you're closed minded about and don't want to try.
* But the riskier HF option, that gives us 2meg blocks and nothing else, and not even a malleability fix, you want to try.
Wow!.... Ok.

Yes, well, I guess this post (that I posted) was a bit premature anyway. I did read somewhere that this release 1.14.3 was meant to run on TestNet5, but I forgot about that until MaxTG brought it up.
But because I forgot this, doesn't make me or my logic retarded, it makes me a little forgetful. I'm sure you never forgot anything you read.

As far as shops accepting Bitcoin:
Why do shops accept cash? Counterfeit bills are passed every day!!! Shops accept paper money because most people are honest and aren't passing counterfeit bills.
Can bitcoins be double-spent?... YES. And most people don't even know how. And even if they did, they wouldn't because they're honest. They aren't out to **rip off the shop**, they just want to pay for the product and be on their way. Just like **the vast majority** of people don't want to pass counterfeit bills, **the vast majority** of people won't attempt the double-spend.
Remember.... All the "real" or main wallets won't even allow you to attempt a double-spend. You have to download a malicious wallet (which probably has viruses trying to steal your bitcoins) to even attempt it!
And once SegWit, RSK, L.N., and Schnorr Signatures are active, these are all going to help reduce the size of the mempool. The smaller the mempool, the harder it is to successfully attempt a double-spend.
Now if shoppes with small ticket items (most sales transactions of $50 or less) and they get double-spent once or twice a year.... Who cares!!! The shop loses more money than that by accidentally accepting counterfeit bills every month or two. (I know people who work at banks. It's quite common for shop owners to have counterfeit bills in their deposits.) This is just a part of doing business. Just like people stealing from the store. Who pays for it?... The honest customer pays. Everything in the store is marked up a few cents to help pay for people stealing product, people passing counterfeit bills, and people passing bad checks.
Shops or stores with bigger ticket items like TV's and kitchen appliances, is a different story. Now you pay the item, and wait for the stock boy to go get it out of the backroom. Maybe there's paperwork that needs to be filled out for the warranty. Maybe the customer's address is needed for delivery! All of this takes time. Time for confirmations to start rolling in. Maybe the store will require **valid current ID** for big ticket items paid for with bitcoin. Do you think someone would attempt a double-spend when the store has their name and home address???? Can you say "collection agency"?
Will all these things stop the double-spend 100%.... No. But they will make the "bad people" think twice about attempting a double-spend. And I think the double-spend would be less common than the passing of counterfeit bills.
And don't forget about the **Lightning Network**!!! Once we get SegWit, we'll get the Lightning Network. Stores can require totals over $50 (or whatever amount they feel necessary) be paid in bitcoin using the Lightning Network. With the Lightning Network, **confirmations are instant**!!! BAM!!! Problem solved.
Just one more reason to fight for, and support SegWit.

There are two major factors making it very hard to make money at "bitcoin terminals", or Bitcoin ATM's, or BTM's.
Factor  BTM Cost
The cost of these BTM's are VERY expensive. A regular cash ATM can be had for 3 to 5 thousand dollars. Most BTM's are $10,000 or more!!! And relatively speaking, bitcoin isn't as popular as cash... NOWHERE close! So the only place these BTM's get any business is downtown in a BIG city. Where it will have millions of people around it. 
Factor  The Unknown
Bitcoin is still very new. Governments don't know what to do with it or how to handle it. Here in the United States, different states have different laws, and the laws keep changing. One minute bitcoin is found to be property (not money) so money transfer laws don't apply. Then the next minute bitcoin is ruled a currency, so your BTM better be AML/KYC compliant, or you could be shut down or arrested, or both.
One minute you're running a legal business, and the next minute you're breaking some city, state, or federal law.
All of this legal crap would have to be all ironed out before I would invest in a BTM.

Hey Barry!.... Do you even understand what Segwit is and what it will do?!?!?!
What is SegWit?:
* A **blocksize INCREASE!!!** 1.6 to 2megs at first. Increasing to 3 to 3.8 early next year with Schnorr Signatures.
* A SoftFork (much safer than a HardFork in Bitcoin right now).
* A malleability fix.
* Makes it much easier to add layers to Bitcoin, like the Lightening Network.
What will SegWit do?:
* Majorly shrink the mempool. Creating....
* Much lower transaction fees.
* Much shorter wait times for confirmations.
If SegWit will do these things, **why do a risky 2xHF** later, when it's very likely we won't need to?!?!?!?!?
**Here's a MUCH better proposal Mr. Silbert...**
SegWit NOW! When a 2xHF is needed, we do it then.

Of course hardware wallets are the safest, but the question was "which software wallets are safe?"
For my Windows desktop, I like Electrum. Don't let the "plain Jane" look fool you. It's a great wallet. Very flexible when it comes to setting the miner's fee. Of course, it's a Windows machine so it's full of security issues and viruses, all trying to steal your Bitcoin, so don't keep too much value on a Windows desktop or laptop.
An Android phone is much safer than a Windows computer. Android OS is basically a Linux OS, which is a thousand times safer than anything from Microsoft. You can even buy a "throw away" phone and never activate it. Simply connect it to your home's WiFi to download a wallet app and keep everything else turned off (like bluetooth and 3G &amp; 4G data). Turn the phone completely off (shut it down) when not in use, and you have a semi-cold wallet. Don't install any other apps, just the Bitcoin wallet you plan on using. For the Android phone, I like Mycelium, Airbitz, and Electrum.
For Apple phones, I'm sorry. I don't have an Apple phone so I have no experience.

Not to mention... SegWit's so fine [there's no other...](

OMG don't say that!!!
I have faith we won't have 2 Bitcoins. I think all this crap is going to work it's way out shortly before Aug 1st. And if it doesn't, it will get worked out shortly after Aug 1st. But the result will be.... 1 Bitcoin with SegWit.
Then.... Several months down the road, the SegWit+2x people are going to want their 2x. But, if SegWit does it's job and keeps the mempool low, resulting in low transaction fees and quick confirmation times... The "2x" part of SegWit+2x simply won't be needed and just fade away.
This whole blocksize/scaling debate reminds me of Y2K. Remember Y2K???? Towards the end of 1999 you would have thought the whole world was going to come to an end at midnight December 31st. Most or all the computers were going to lock up, crippling the financial industry, causing riots in the streets, the burning of major cities to the ground, and neighbors attacking neighbors for food!!!!!! And then January 1st, 2000, very few computers had an issue. And by January 3rd everything was worked out without anything major going down.
I'm thinking... SegWit + RSK + L.N. + Schnorr Signatures, should postpone the need for 2x for at least 2 years, maybe 3 or 4.

First off... Waiting 4-5 hours for a Bitcoin transfer is a relatively new thing for the 8 and a half year old Bitcoin Network. It is also temporary. This "wait time" issue should go back to 10-20 minutes, with transaction fees of 4 to 12 cents (USD). SegWit, Lightning Network, RSK, Schorr Signatures, are all going to help get Bitcoin back to where it should be.
Second.... Yes, transferring money from one account to another (example: Your checking account or your savings account - at the same bank) is near instant. But try transferring money from one bank to a different bank (even if you own both accounts). You might "see" that the funds have transferred almost instantly, but the transfer is flagged "pending" by the receiving bank for 3 to 7 days!!!! Meaning, you can't draw on those funds during that time. This is my experience with the banking system in the USA.
Don't judge Bitcoin when it's at it's worst, towards the end of a two year long struggle to solve the it's scaling issue. Bitcoin hasn't always had this problem, and it's not a permanent problem either. If RSK goes live in July and we can get SegWit activated by the end of August, we'll be well on the road to fixing all of this.

This is GREAT news! Thank you GBMiners for supporting SegWit!!!!
And remember...... [SegWit is so fine...](

You Betcha! I don't know much about Jeff at all. I know a little about Mike. I think Mike's story is much like Gavin's.
Gavin was the "Big Fish, In A Little Pond." Gavin did a lot for Bitcoin in the beginning, when the space was small and he was one of the brights guys in the space. He also had a lot of communication with Satoshi. But when Bitcoin started to grow, and more and more people started entering the space, and Gavin wasn't one of the smartest guys in the room anymore. And as even more people entered, more coders MUCH better than Gavin entered.... Pushing Gavin farther and farther down the totem pole. He went from "Top Dog" to "Not Such A Great Programmer" in a few years.
But Gavin wanted to be "Top Dog" again. He liked the feeling of being the smarted guy in the room.... So he went over to work with the BU group.
I guess he got his wish.

900?!?!?!! That's a very old number. Right now, there are over 3,000 0.14.1/UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148) running. This is about 40% of the total Bitcoin Node Network.
This is from BitNodes.21.com

You do **not** have to stand around waiting in front of an ATM you just sold bitcoin to. Some ATM's are different, but most of them are similar to this...
1) You identify yourself to the ATM by giving it your cell phone number. Then the ATM will text you a code to make sure you put the phone number in correctly.
2) Then you send the ATM some amount of bitcoin. At this point of course, when you send the bitcoin you control now much of a miner fee to attach. Also at this point, the bitcoin per dollar amount is LOCKED in.
3) The ATM will then print out a receipt with details of the transaction, a QR code, and a note to tell you to return to the ATM after X amount of confirmations. If it's a small transaction I'm sure the confirmation count will be 1. Larger transactions might require 2 or 3 confirmations.
At this point, you can go run errands, go grocery shopping, get a haircut, get a bite to eat, or anything else you'd like to do.
4) Once you see on your phone's wallet that the require confirmations have been met (minutes later, hours later) you simply return to the ATM **at your convenience**. You scan the QR printed on your receipt, or put in your phone number and have it text you a code to enter, and the ATM will give you your money due.
And again..... Once SegWit, RSK, L.N., Schnorr Segnatures, are up and running, you can attach a small transaction fee and the wait time will be 10 to 20 minutes if you want to hang around and wait. Even now the wail time would be 10 to 20 minutes if you attach a 60 to 80 cent fee. But why wait? Go run errands. Be productive. Your money will be waiting for YOU when you return after the required amount of confirmations.
