As I said yesterday this is looking very bad.


Some people say well that's no reason to assume the worse but in my opinion they are well aware trading has stopped so either they are grossly incompetent or something is up.
No smoke without fire in my opinion and I'm calling vaporware on the whole thing now.
They spend whatever investment they has on a huge launch party and that's all we are going to see from them
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:34:09
All depends on your perspective, 
I consider the current infinate growth capitalist system broken anyway so if changing to a more local resource based economy happens I'll consider it more sustainable for humankind in the long run.
The system needs to be reformed, but that's not going to happen, because it doesn't benefit the people in power. The only things that will change this is revolution or a major clusterfucking distaster
yes everyone will be in the same boat but at least it might be the kick people need to make a real change toward sustainable living in the long run,
Lack of internet wont worry me too much since everyone else wont be on facebook either :)

Keep sticking your head in the sand if you want I've provided more substance and logic then you can possibly provide against my arguement. 
I will never PROVE it since technically it cant exist because free market, blah blah blah 
BUT if you feel like taking your head out of your ideologically perfect ass you will find the ability to manipulate crypto markets is the reason people are drawn to them, Just look at what wolong did to doge and if you need proof you can go ask him about it or check his post history
If thats not enough for you the guy wrote a freaking BOOK about how to manipulate crypto markets for feck sake.
I'll even be good enough to link it to you for free via pastebin as I think you have some learning to do if you ever want to get ahead in crypto markets ;) 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:34:30
Small overisght on my part: 
When BTC is worth less like it is now there should be more actual bitocin short to have the same $$ value so when 1BTC is worth $650 is not the same as 1 BTC short when worth 800.
That might go some ways in explaining the rise

Well you would be quite wrong then I'm afraid to say.
Yes there is what you would call capital control but Iceland defaulted on it's debts in 2008 and told the bankers to shove it rather than go through IMF austerity.
To stem panic they did stop convertability but are due to lift the restriction this year
Their currency has been quite undervalued of late but economy is doing very well.

I would say bifinex, They proved themselves as champs after the flash crash last month and paid back people who lost money because they were unable to close trades (myself included) 
If you check the thread on [ bitcointalk]( you can see raphael the owner is quite active in answering questions and any time I have had a question about a delayed withdrawal and e-mailed support I got a personal answer from him. *screenshot (
I've actually been so impressed I decided to become an affiliate last week so if you feel like signing up I'd be delighted if you used my referral and in return I'll try and answer any further questions you may have about them. 
Edit. If you get a bit more serious about day trading I find bitfinex by far the best for margin trading. Btc-e's meta trader is ok and you have option of slightly higher leverage (3:1 btc-e vs 2.5:1 finex) but it's a PITA to use as you have to move funds to a totally different account and to get them back you need to wait on tc-e to process it manually which means no trading for up to 24 hours while funds are in limbo. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:17:51

If anything people like you are the reason bitcoin wont go mainstream because fact is most people like regulation since it makes their lives easier and frees up their time to do other things like earn a living instead of checking the financial statements of everyone they wish to do business with or checking what's in their food is really what the producer says it is. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:49:53

Ok so lets work with you here for a second. Tell me specifically what qualifies as evidence of insider trading in a crypto currency marketplace?
Why do you refuse to confirm my sources?, They are only anecdotal while you refuse to verify them and you only need to search for "crypto pump dump" RIGHT NOW on Twitter to find people AT THIS MOMENT asking others to sell/buy at certain price points and join private rooms to orchestrate such things.
At least anyone reading this discussion can see how childish you are in saying I provide nothing to this discussion while you just stand there saying "not good enoguh"

Bit of an overstatement there I think, Plus as someone who recently became one of those "third level educuated" I can confirm most of us are leaving the country for better paid positions abroad
You might not want to hear this but tech companies ARE there for tax reasons, I live in Finland where google and facebook along with many other multinational's are actively recruiting staff to work in Ireland rather than move the jobs here where they would naturally be (but why pay 22% tax when you can have zero to a max of 12.5%  in Ireland and entice workers over with promises of pints and craic or however they spin it)
If you want to know the feeling on this sort of practice look no further than [Looking to work outside Finland?? Why not look at Ireland]( 
Personally I cant wait for Irelands tax rates to be forced in line as the above situation of importing workers to avoid tax when we are supposed to be living in a single market laughable.
Right now Ireland is like the sweatshop of European IT workers while our govnerment continues ramming those no skills required/no taxes paid twitter support jobs down down peoples throats like it's good news, 
I'll be back when there is real jobs being created in a sustainable tax climate, Forunately when you move abroad you can see Ireland for the banana republic it is.
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:50:43
Most people look at the facts and make up their own mind.
No facts exist as to whether or not Kennedy was shot/Aliens exist but people decide one way or another anyway even without evidence. 
You are only limiting yourself if you refuse to take a side on something without knowing 100% facts on it. 
I can tell you are not a trader anyway because odds and opinion are the name of that game so why not accept I know a bit more on this topic than you.
Or how about you just give me your opinion, Don't worry it doesn't have to be versed in fact but just what you as a human being think on the topic of insider trading in bitcoin? 
Unless of course I am talking to a bot here which it's starting to sound like

@_date: 2014-03-16 23:15:46
Your post lacks context. Are you talking about regulated mediums, or unregulated mediums in terms of bitcoin, bitcoin exchanges or just in general as seems to be the theme here? 
For the record, I along with most people in bitocin more than a year or so knew something was up with MtGox and took my money out of there before last November. 
That said I blame people like me for this obvious flaw in self regulation that is "Doesn't affect me syndrome" 
Looking at it from the outside if I was a new hobby user hearing about bitcoin on the news I would probably have sent money to MtGox as well after hearing their price being quoted everwhere.

How is that short position working out for you? :P
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:56:46
Well the max margin is 2.5:1 so would need a $200 rise at least.
Thing is losses are also compunded so if trading on margin for every $1 bitcoin rises you lose $2.5
But yes any sort of price rise now will start to panic the guys holding all these positions.
Whenever the price dos start to rise fast I expect it to moon a bit

I'm giving another illustration just as stDemigod did of the fact that wealth will always rise to the top. 
If you spend your $200 just to get around the board to collect another $200 you are giving it to the guy who owns all the property to imporve his situation while you struggle to make it around again.
Fact is most the plannet is already owned and most of us pay rent. 
Unless you want to go ahead and elimate property rights as well chances are your anarcho-capatilism won't do much but make things worse
I'm afraid the same thing happens in bitcoin too only there a whale needs to only move a few coins to depress the markets.
If you were a trader you would understand what I mean.

well she doesn't say for sure it's the guy who created bitcoin so I don't know where you pulled that from but wrote a story connecting the dots between the online identity of satochi and this man who neither confirmed nor denied he is the person but did say is is no longer involved.

When you short sell on Bitfinex it automatically opens a contract at the lowest ask price.
In a sense you could be right but most have all been opened in the past few days and who borrows bitocoin on loan (knowing they have to pay back the same amounf of bitocin with interest) unless they want to sell them now and buy back lower

Well I don't know about extra paperwork part which you also mentioned but seing as the law was made in 2009 and only since then most manufacturers got their shit in line, I would say it's proof the regulation was needed.
The main reason I seen for different conenctions existing was nothing about data transfer and more about making maney from users who require a second or replacement charger at the expense of usability and the environment.  The fact that the EU HAD to step in shows how when money is at stake companies will do illogical things just to make a buck. 
About the consequences, well If you want to sell your phone in the EU just make sure it can be recharged via micro-usb. Either incorporate it into the design or include an adapter if you MUST go with a proprietary connection.
Your second point does make some sense but chances are they will update it every 5/6 years or so as a new standard becomes commonplace. 
About the corruption, note the .org in usb.org, that is all.
All in all yea maybe some genius new cable won't be developed but standardization where it makes sense does not cripple innovation as it will happen in other (not so mass market areas)
For example me and my friends all have an xbox 360, I can play them in a new game knowing their system can also support the same game and they also cant complain about bad frame rate or how their system is worse than mine as PC gamers go.
Is the Xbox 1 less advanced because standardization happens in the console market, not really because the new technology is developed for PC gaming first and then when the time is right a new standard is adopted in console gaming and this has been going on for decades without a problem. 
Usb is also a pc standard that has now made it down to phones (which funny enough are also like mini pc's now) so the 10 or so years they spent innovating phone cables didn't lead to any great results I might add
That said I really do hope moleneux does decide to rant about this as it will be one more thing to set my opinion that he's is nothing more than a contrarian. 
Edit: I don't want to sound like a contrarian here myself and I do respect some of his ideas but he must know deep down a lot of the shit he says will never or could never work, It just sounds good because nobody can prove him wrong (in theory)

One of the common selling points for bitcoin I hear is that it's free from govnerment regulation and interference and you are free to be your own bank etc and I'm saying we now created a market that's in fact MORE interfeered with and controlled in private than the model it's attempting to replace. 
This therefore makes it less open to the common man than the govnerment regulated markets we have in place right now.
I mean why would I want to keep my money in the bank regulated by Mark karpelles and whoever else feels like controlling it?

The point is people have come to assume a burger means beef and maybe some rusk for filler.
I'm making the point that most people don't want to have to second guess what's going into a product.
It's bad enough with the current regulation but what happens with no regulation, Considering corporate ethics I would guess as long as it tastes like the consumer expects it's ok.
Imagine without regulation how many more time people would have to ask questions like the following (and yes even with regulation this did happen) and should serve as proof there is not much ethics in the food production business 


As for your second point that's exactly what I am trying to say just without the extreme words like "poisoning" which you suggest.
Libertarians love to say "well they would go out of business" 
well what if they were going out of business anyway? 
For some people cutting a few corners is more moral than seeing betty and bob with two kids who worked here 10 years lose their job. Maybe not indirectly but yes people would be poisoned.
I have experience in agriculture and as it stands I see people try to cut corners eaver day so please take my word that less regulation means things will only get worse.

Thank you for some sanity, As an Irish ex-pat I can defiately say our media loves to play up all the new tech jobs (Mostly support roles and non development bty) and there is a bit of kool aid drinking going on as to why they are coming. 
To put it simply it's cheaper for facebook to have their European HQ in Dublin and import multilingual staff from europe (Who mostly are college grads looking to work short time in a new country) then to setup in the local counties and pay tax 
Ironiclly best hope for Ireland retaining those jobs in future comes from the UK leaving the EU (or even threat of it)

I'm sorry but I can't watch a one hour video just to hear your view on free market environmentalism just to get your tl;dr on how food standards can be maintined without regulation.
Can you tell me your opinon in a paragraph if thats possible?
I totally agree the govnerment does a pretty lously job but at the end of the day they at least lay down a standard and if you get E. Coli from the salad at McDonalds and can prove it then you can at least be compensated and the same threat at least keeps them from poisioning people.
As it stands where I live a "beef burger" must contain at least 80% beef, by putting the word "value" in front of that you can drop it to 51% and use some other organs like the heart along with grains for filler.
Point I'm trying to make is without even these stupid regulations what will we be left with, In my opinion it will be "as long as the customer thinks it tastes like a burger anything is ok"
With regulation the same companies will go as close as they can to breaking the law without doing so and for that reason I don't want to live in a world where I stop buying x because people are dying and that's before I even consider the stuff people could put in food that would not affect our health for many years.

Keep sticking your head in the sand if you want. I've provided more substance and logic then you can possibly provide against my arguement. I will never PROVE it since technically it cant exist because free market, blah blah blah
BUT if you feel like taking your head out of your ideologically perfect ass you will find the ability to manipulate crypto markets is the reason people are drawn to them, Just look at what wolong did to doge and if you need proof you can go ask him about it or check his post history
 
If thats not enough for you the guy wrote a freaking BOOK about how to manipulate crypto markets for feck sake. I'll even be good enough to link it to you for free via pastebin as I think you have some learning to do if you ever want to get ahead in crypto markets ;)

I love how any evidence of unnatural trading patterms in bitcoin is put down to misclicks or fat fingers.
Sometimes people like to shake the market down and put some doubt in there or maybe the guy was hoping to trigger stop losses and start a bit of a cascading effect. 
Whenever I sleep in a long position in this currently crazy market I set a trailing stop so if the price moves more than a set amount it triggers my stop loss.
So yea in this case they lost money in that single 10 minute trading window but what if they started a much larger selloff and from what I can see the market has been trending down since then so perhaps the dump (and threat of future dumps) has had the destabalizing effect that the seller desired. 
TL;dr you cant predict what other intentions are in the marketplace

Play a game of monopoly sometime, 
Even with random chance added in via dice, chance cards and free money the person with most money after a few rounds will nearly always win.
Right now the current govnerment system works like that (free money, random market interference cards)
Only difference is when you play the game with anarcho capitalist rules there is no "chance" cards and everyone starts the game with however much money they have in their bank account.

Do they own the whole business? From what I read the answer is no. 
Bitcoin seller can be also a customer of the coffee shop.
When he buys his coffee he enters into a sort of contract to be allowed comsume it and conduct his own personal business there. 
Why should ATM owner have rights over the piece of space he doesn't rent?

Thanks for spelling out the obviious oversights I made there.
I'm guesing you would need at least 7% difference to make a go at it then I guess.
Then again if you have BTC and Fiat in both exchanges whats to stop you making a sell on one in BTC and a purchase on the other to cancel out the risk.
Could be fun anyway 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:13:40
True, But I think Joe Schmo still has time to get lucky before the first hedge fund publically puts some BTC on their books. 
Just the news of one fund doign that would push the price over $1000 IMO and so woudl be a smart move foe any HF manager since it would be win/win

Thanks so much, If I get them out with your advice I'll make sure to send you on a tip.

As long as they cant get lost in the blockchain forever I'm ok
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:49:05
They have 12 hours and it's not really a time to cancel but a time to confirm the payment, If you don't pay you get bad ratings and people wont trade with you in future.
I'd consider it closer to  a peer to peer lending model than an actual exchange

Yea whats the deal with the SEPA deposits.
I transferred money to my Mt.Gox account on 04 April to do some trading and 8 days later nothing.
I contaced your support with the transaction details and they told me "The transaction is yet to reflect we will continue to check and keep you posted." 
I contaced back today and nothing!! 
Thanks for pretty much scaring me away
TLDR.. How long is it taking SEPA deposits to be reflected on the Mt.Gox site right now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:54:54
Of course, that probably makes them one of the biggest holders right now and considering they only stand to seize more I don't know why they would even want the tainted coin legislation

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:19:01
I guess you didnt understand, 
Vendor doesn't lose either as they set a $$ value they want and what normally happens when orders are hedged is silk road sells your coins that instant for market value as they get them and usually end up even but now that there is such huge price differences and Mt.Gox paused they are calculating the prices based at &gt;$100 per coin so it's Silk Road that losing not me or any vendors there
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:07:30
It's probably from everyone moving their coins there before the supposed "attack" happens 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:18:05

Hopefully stoner logic prevails

Who's talking about fiat though, 
If you were interested in arb'ing you could have $1000 on both ecxhanges, buy all the coins at 103 on bitstamp, Move them to MT.Gox and unload, 
Sure it will take a few days to get your fiat out of MT.gox and back to Bitstamp but you already made your 10% or $100 
Rince and repeat, Or am I missing somthing in that big over simplification

@_date: 2013-04-10 21:48:50
Nah man, I think you are wrong on this one *or at least partly wrong, 
Had a look thorugh the SR forum there and read they offer two options to merchants there, 
They can charge a fixed btc price or a $ hedged value based on the average daily bitcoin price at time of sale which SR updates every 10 minutes. 
Normally that would mean, they take your BTC and sell it right away for $$ at current values but giving you the average MT Gox price for the past 24 hours for your bitcoins.
Also I've watched the prices there tick up ever so gradually over the past 2 hours as the mean bitcoin price for the day creaps downwards.
Of course you may be right in that they could reject your order if bitcoin bottoms out completely but considering I think this is just a tempory dip in price I think I got in at a good time and perhaps it's another way to take advantage the markets.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:57:47
I think someone found it through analysis but at least now someone is sure to notice is they move it to another address to sell

@_date: 2013-04-15 11:44:55
Yea after having a look around the internet, I found this to be true, 
You don't have to be a German resident to open a German bank account right now but you do have to show up there at least once with papers so theres the problem right there.
I think about 85% of their client base is German so I'd imagine they will just focus on that side.
I just hope it doesn't end up pushing out us other Europeans who use the site in the end
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:29:08

@_date: 2013-04-11 13:00:58
Ok, Enquiring mind of mine just had a read round the SR forums and found sellers discussing this exact topic, 
It seems this is how it works
Unhedged escrow:-
Buyer places an order for 1BTC and 1BTC is in escrow. When buyer receives their good 1BTC is released to the seller regardless of BTC price. In the event of a dispute any refunds will be calculated on the bitcoin. For example a 50% refund is agreed the buyer will receive 0.5BTC and the vendor will receive 0.5BTC.
Hedged escrow:-
Buyer places an order at 10am on 25 March 2013 for 1BTC and $100 is in escrow. The buyer receives their goods on 27 March and the bitcoin price has up to $200. 0.5BTC ($100) is released to the seller.  In the event of a dispute any refunds will be calculated on the dollar. For example a 50% refund is agreed on 27 March 2013 where the bitcoin price is $200. The buyer will receive 0.25BTC ($50) and the vendor will receive 0.25BTC ($50).
So it seems what happened yesterday is basically me getting a bargain at silk roads expense :/ 
They sell the bitcoins that arre hedged at market prices but their own algorthym works by offering the end user the 24 hour rolling average MT.Gox price which it updates regular. 
I guess this system worked just fine for them when coins were worth between $25 and $35 but simply doesn't scale when bitcoins are worth between $150 and $250 each.
Also it seems their own systems were affected by the lag on Mt.Gox too and were not updating prices as often as they should. 
I guess this is the reason SR take 10% off the retailers there as they might be out a bit of cash after the recent price turmoil if more people like me caught on to how it works but it seems people are still unsure of how exactly hedging works even on the forums there lol :)

@_date: 2013-04-19 10:44:24
I sold all my bitcoin at that price too yesterday after makeing my margin but bought back in later after reading some news and getting a sense of the market. 
I could have held them until today and made even more but that's how I do it as I'm more likely to panic sell when I think my bigger profit/loss in on the line
My own thing is I buy at a price point and decide then at what price I will sell at (high or low) and stick to it.
I think there is a good reason why whey say you need to be some sort of sociopath to make it as a trader as you need to make calculate decisions and not go with emotion.
If I'm losing money I don't wait and hope the price will climb instead I get out at the point I say I will and forget about it.

Well done, Did you just play Mt Gox? 
I've been messing around with arbitage between Bitstamp and Mt.Gox, Bitstamp been consistantly $5 below Mt.Gox and soemtimes as much as $12 at the same time.
Like you I got a bit lucky and bought 10 @ 90 on Bitstamp and unloaded @ 118 on Mt.gox

@_date: 2013-04-16 12:36:25
I was just going to post a topic similar as usually bitstamp is the lower market and Mt.Gox higher.
Maybe this is a sign that the money is coming out of Mt.Gox and into other exchanges as traditionally bitstamp has been about $2 lower than Mt.Gox on average 
As regards trading right now it's more of a guessing game and with the fees your margins will be small.
Also it could turn around just as fast so the money is in taking the gamble just like buiying butcoins at the spot price on any exchange at the minute
EDIT *4 minutes later there is $1 between the prices so you are really as well off buying low on one exchange and hoping the price rises than doing this to be honest
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:51:09

That site looks so 1995
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:47:39
wow, such a non jewish thing to do.
I call shenanigans on the op :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:17:29
qt :/
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:34:55
As someone with not enought to invest in the first place I'm finding this very amusing indeed
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:36:29
But what terrible odds
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:14:32
I just realised I sounded like such a shady infomercial guy there but seriously anyone who has an accoutn there should check out the prices right now
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:11:07
As somone waiting to buy when shit truely hits the fan...Thank you
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:24:18
In other words OP needs a dick stuffed in his mouth
@_date: 2013-07-24 16:00:04
Expect the price to drop as burned victims seek to cash out once they get their coins back.
Edit..Never mind I just read they most likely wont be returned
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:38:05
It seems you cant buy razors with bitcoin just yet anyway 
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:32:50
And sounds like a pompus dick. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:51:18
So in other words they are working on their own alternative.
Good luck getting them to adopt bitcoin for payments now :/
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:54:01
Wut??? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:43:49
Fuck yea, Why ISNT there one in Berlin by now? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:46:24
I dont think its that common and I made lots of transfers before withouth paying a TX fee but I don't need to wait days/weeks right now when everyone elses transactions with fees are being calculated with higher priority. 
Trying the method another posted suggested and hopefully it enables me to double spend
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:07:08
Ohh man...... This keeps getting better and better
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:20:52
And yesterday all I got was [downvotes]( 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:18:29
No it's not..
I'll buy at three fiddy 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:48:05
If I download a different client, can I just plugin in my wallet.dat file again.
Maybe I just give up and hold until the transaction gets cancelled 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:03:54
Well I can say one thing the prices are the same on silk road as they were 5 hours ago despite the crazy price drop.
BUY DRUGS......BUY
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:29:32
Apple fanboys to the rescue!!!!
*****Go team jobs****** yayyyyyyyyyyyy
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:33:52
it wont seem so stupid when the buyer files a dispute with paypal and get their money back + 3 free bitcoins.
Risks of selling on E-bay are huge
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:24:31
Thanks for the great opportunity, 
I'm just waiting to recieve my return on investment from a Nigerian prince I helped a while back but I'll be sure to take advantage of this great offer soon
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:32:58
*says the redditor for 29 minutes
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:41:58
$40 try $1000 that I deposied there 6 years ago and at todays prices it's worth over 3000 last tiem I looked, 
Can still access my account but USA has it's freedom written all over it
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:03:17
Who says I don't want to buy illegal things and services in the onion :) 
Plus more than likely it will rock bottom as those who been in bitcoin for a while probably cashed in and are waiting to buy back so I hope to buy a few in the sweet spot 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:00:55
PR is just another way of polishing a turd, 
Why don't you just be straight and say whats really going on.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:21:38
Damm..Better put a penny in my account then so
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:57:04
Dammit, I was just thinking to make a withdrawl but I think I wont chance it now after hearing about your delay.
Does anyone know how long they take to make a transfer to ok pay or dolla.
I'm assuming it must be a bit faster 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:55:36
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:52:17
Well going forward I can buy more,  figure out my current buy/sell dilemma and I get to know will I have sounded stupid shouting "bitcoin to the moon" in the latter part of 2013 and correct myself now
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:35:08
and cheap, They probably think they already missed the bargain 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:05:22
Bulltrap 
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:31:35
Yep, and with an annoying tone of voice as well.
Actually all he needs is a fedora and to be swedish to be the perfect redditor 
@_date: 2013-05-06 20:07:07


So bitcoin has WAGS now. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:58:10
Just one other question, Should bitcoin qt be eating up my cpu now for hours on end 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:33:01
about three fiddy
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:17:33
