How are they able to censor the transaction on the blocks? As far as I know, nobody can edit the blocks.

At $3.5k 'You are gambling. You will gamble everything and lose all' 
At $4k 'I am not interested to hear about it'
At $5k 'I don't trust your Internet money, I trust my bank and comfortable about it' 
At $6k 'Whatever.....' 
Today at $6.9k when I mentioned that I am going to move some of my personal savings into Bitcoin 'Bitcoin is the least important things right now' while she on the bed at 3pm checking Facebook. 
Well... Whatever that I have, it's mine and my kids. Their future.
