This could be huge for Factom as they aim to solve this very problem.

How big is the BTC blockchain?

I assure you that the internet wasn't very exciting for the vast majority of the populace when it was in its infancy either.  Although once we figured out how to make boobs out of letters and numbers in text files we could upload to various BBS's, things started to really take off.

I am indeed using QT.  Thank you.

All TCP/IP application layer protocols :)
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:31:54
Fair enough.  Thanks for sharing your perspective :)

When do we get away from that chaos again?
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:12:53
Thanks for correcting me :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:53:30
What does this mean exactly?  Why does a blockchain need pruned?  And when?
Thank you.

Hah!  USR!  I remember buying a bunch of shares of them thinking they were going to be the next Microsoft.

All of those are TCP/IP application layer protocols.  In Bitcoin protocol terms, those technologies haven't even been invented yet.  We're THAT early.

Your investing in Hayes is like investing in Coinbase.  Buying Bitcoin is like buying TCP/IP.  You're investing in a protocol.  At present, it is a financial protocol but like TCP/IP, countless applications that we can't even fathom at present will be built upon it.

Wanna know what year I finally got an answer from the IRS about how to depreciate my domains?

Thank you kindly.

I realize it may be difficult for some to see the serious message within my parody, but it is there.

Let's use the 99% figure you mention.  That means that as the cryptocurrency ecosystem grows, 1 in 100 or 10 in 1000 need to wait at least one block (or around 10 minutes).  There are 25 million credit card transactions per day.  That means, every day, 250,000 transactions would have to wait 10 minutes or more for confirmation.  This is not acceptable in a modern economy.

Fair enough.  You bet on egold :)  I was never excited about egold for a variety of reasons.
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:09:19
Excellent point.  Thank you for sharing that perspective!

But Bitcoin makes me feel YOUNG!

I'm a reasonably early adopter of Bitcoin and I LOVE the fights that are going on.  THIS is how it SHOULD be.  People passionate on each side and the market will decide.  Fiat has the federal reserve directors dictating moneytary policy whereas Bitcoin has thousands of nerds fighting it out and if they don't agree, we get a fork and the market can decide.
It's beautiful.

Once asteroid mining starts (and make no mistake, it's not that far off) then the true value of Bitcoin versus gold as a store of value will showcase itself.

Factom (Factom.com) just received 4.2 million in funding for exactly this.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:54:56
How is this different or better than Factom?

Do you know what happens to GBTC in the event of a fork creating two coins?
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:36:06
For a little perspective, the market cap of Enron at it's peak bubble was about 70 billion dollars.  A single bubble stock had that market cap.
No, Bitcoin is not bubbling.  It's still very much in its' infancy.  Bitcoin is a global, deflationary currency and store of value in an inflationary world that also has amazing utility.
Will Bitcoin have corrections?  Of course.  But are we in a bubble? Absolutely not.

Found it.  "If a permanent fork, similar to Ethereum, were to occur to bitcoin, the Trust would hold equal amounts of the original and the new bitcoin as a result. In consultation with the Index Provider, the Sponsor would select a Bitcoin Network (and therefore a single version of bitcoin). The Sponsor would simultaneously isolate the bitcoin on the Bitcoin Network that it did not select to segregate it from the Trust’s Bitcoin Holdings. The Sponsor’s intention would be to distribute to its Shareholders the bitcoin on the Bitcoin Network that it did not select. Therefore, the Trust would only hold one version of bitcoin. It is uncertain whether the value of the distribution of the bitcoin on the Bitcoin Network that the Sponsor did not select would equal the change in the value of the Shares. Consequently, a permanent fork could materially and adversely affect the value of the Shares."

Does anyone know what happens with GBTC IF Bitcoin forks?  Is there a stock split or does the company behind GBTC keep one of the coins?

Someone wake me when Coinbase doesn't make you feel like a terrorist when enforcing their KYC laws.  I understand the need to follow KYC and have been fine with all my banks doing do, but never have I been made to feel like a fucking terrorist like the clowns at Coinbase.

One of the beautiful aspects of Bitcoin is there is no central authority.  I DO NOT want any authority forced upon me.  If you want to create some sort of insurance or group that is VOLUNTARY, that is fine, but the last thing I want is Bitcoin empowering any sort of authority.  I want Bitcoin to remove authority.
Now, this means that we are all going to have to re-learn the lost art of personal responsibility and that will be tough on many.  But that's a good thing.

Let's get this fucker a superbowl spot.  A funny ad of BTC raping a dollar or something.
Ok, I probably shouldn't be part of the creative team, but I'd donate for the ad.

I remember when the internet first started to make a little headway. It took me about 14 hours to get my screaming fast 1200 bit modem to finally connect me properly.
Bitcoin is a new PROTOCOL, not just a currency. First the technologically literate find their way in. They then set the foundation for future expansion.
We're currently at the 1200 bit modem phase. Just wait until you get that 14400 installed. It's going to be SCREAMING!

My family has always wanted to go to the Galapagos.  How old do you recommend a child be to go on your Galapagos trip?  And how do I pay with Bitcoin?  I don't see the option on the website.
