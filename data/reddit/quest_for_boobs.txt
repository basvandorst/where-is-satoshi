Thanks, my BTC net work is doubled! :)
I do have this weird sensation about BTC, that in a few years when its usage becomes common everywhere, we'll be chuckling about how we were there when the first steps for mainstream adoption were being taken. Sure, it's a bit of a bumpy road with sites having issues and scammers in every corner, but it is an exciting time to see how a marketplace gets built from scratch.

I just downloaded the 1.9 executable and dropped it on the same folder as the previous one, and launched it. My wallet and BTC opened with no problem and all funds intact.

Thanks! Downloading it now.

While using mobiles for mine for Bitcoin is ridiculous, this sets an interesting precedent that developers are willing to monetize their apps and get BTC in return. There's an opportunity here for an advertisement startup to start operating in BTC.

Well, I [actually have 0.01 BTC]( 999,999,999 people to go!

Yeah, I'm kind of having a problem with that right now. How do I import the wallet.dat file from the other client into this one? Or do I have to create an all new wallet to use with Electrum?

According to [this calculator]( if you calculated 777328 MegaHashes per second, you'd get one Bitcoin per day.

What happens when I want to send payments? Say I have five different addresses with $5 on each and I want to send $20 to someone, is that a single transaction or five different transactions (because I have to pay the transaction fees, and the funds on the first four addresses won't be enough for that)?
Can you link me to an example transaction where money from several wallets goes into a single one?

Thanks :)

Thanks, I still feel weird about the idea of wallets being disposable accounts. I intellectually know I could create a wallet per second for my entire lifespan and it wouldn't even register on the pool of available addresses, but I still feel like I'm wasting a perfectly good address.

I joined the Bitcoin subreddit last week, specifically trying to get used to it for the next Humble Bundle, and then WB dropped a Humble Bundle with two games I really wanted to play and weren't available to me before due to GFWL region restrictions. So I was very happy to be able to make it my first Bitcoin purchase!
