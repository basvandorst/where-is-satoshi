ELI5 is in the Reddit lexicon.  ETAM is not.

Bitcoin is digital heroin, not digital gold
Your average guy is buying $50 of Bitcoin because it's a cheap ticket to the hottest topic in the world today.  But watch out, the thrill of clicking "BUY" brings with it an immense sense of power and control.  Bitcoin is a shot of adrenaline.  We wants it.  We needs it.  Must have the precious.  
On the corner of main street Bitcoin is digital heroin, not digital gold.

Test that each word in your recovery phrase is valid using this tool:
Very easy to misspell the word "Dilema" for example ;-)

Brilliant work guys.  I live and work in Europe and travel to the US for business a few times a year.  Your app will allow me to top-up my US Chase account with dollars ahead of my business trips, saving me from costly transaction and transfer fees.

Surely the play is to own both 1:1.  The combed value was rather stable.  With BCH near $1000, that is your entire downside.  But if BCH challenges BTC again, expect to see a zero sum price flip.  At the very least it will protect your emotional capital and likely save you from fomo trading like an idiot, reducing your stack in the process.

Exactly.  Bitcoin isn't for us.  It's for the little guy behind the wall of tyranny.

It could be.  Best to reduce risk.

At least you didn’t switch sides and Short!  I’m sure there are more than a few who did.

I recommend Ledger Wallet HW1.  Inexpensive and solid technology.

I have a EUR &amp; USD Bit-X Visa card which I use when travelling in Europe and the USA.  I load the card with enough spend for a few days and topup when it runs low.  This limits the risk of carrying my normal Credit/Debit cards - which I can keep in the hotel safe.  It is also useful if you have teenagers or kids at college.  You can top-up a fixed amount each week/month without the worry of them overspending.  Plus it can be topped-up anytime of the day or night should there be an emergency.
