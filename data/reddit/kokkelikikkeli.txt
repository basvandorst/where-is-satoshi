Yeah it's not a surprise people are not happy about the creator abandoning his coin and leaving it in a freefall. I for one am never going to trust that guy and anything with his fingerprints again.

I've never heard it called a conflict of interest if the CEO owned a share of his own company. Care to explain?

You're actually the only asshole here. Fuck off, little bitch.

Could be, and then break 50k and then 100k. You just  hold your worthless bitcashoin garbage, little rat. Bitcoin is going to the moon.

Hell, why not 100? Hell, why not 1000 by the end of the week?

Fanboyism is strong in this one. I hope you're happy with how LTC is crashing right now though :'D

Yeah I'm sure he cares very deeply after having no horse in the race. I mean, I own LTC too, but stop being fucking delusional.

Yeah I sure would rather believe an 18 year old redditor with 3 weeks of experience as a professional crypto daytrader than a guy with 25 year experience in finance.

Nah it's a cheap copy by a known scammer and will lose all its value as soon as people realize that.

Alright let's see the proof of you demanding proof of that even *one* time. Otherwise, you're the fucking liar with false information.
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:37:22
You always demand proof when the news say the police seized cash, or otherwise it "didn't happen"?
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:50:47
The police and the news don't have to show you their proof about seizing btc either, nobody gives a shit what some salty cryptokid on reddit thinks lmao.

He should sell whenever he feels like it so fuck off.
