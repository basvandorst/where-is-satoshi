These waters have been chartered, mapped, and explored more than New York City. History shows a recovery is on it's way faster than Jimmy John's to a catered event.

Anybody else curious to know what the other coin he invested in is?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:44:05
Anybody heard of ETHLend?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:37:07
ETHLend is a really neat way to invest using other funds you may already have in Crypto. Check it out! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:59:56
My cryptocurrency of the week: ETHLend - decentralized loans. They've recently launched their DAPP, and with that comes the potential for absolutely anybody to get a loan using cryptocurrency. This will be extremely helpful for people that are wanting to get loans to ride the gains.

The pyramids were a great feat my friend. Obviously you haven't looked at their advisory board. Solid team backed by years of experience. One of their members plays a major role in BTC as well. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:33:52
I'm too busy in ETHLend right now. It's very undervalued at the moment. Was on BTC, but there's more of a potential to see a several x increase in something that has a 60M market cap. Solid team, solid product (which is already available to use), and meetups scheduled for tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:34:16
I'd give you one but I'm all out of Satoshi. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:45:16
For anybody who is looking for an altcoin with huge potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:57:11
It took longer than that. A lot of people held at 20c-25c and many gave up because with any good news, it would not increase it's price. Finally, it tripled in price off of some MAJOR announcements. It's really a safe bet crypto that won't be going anywhere due to it's partnerships. I was in it, but am now in ETHLend. You guys should check it out and get in while you can if interested.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:24:29
It's not a valid concern. Just look at their team and the roles each person has and history and you'll realize that's not what they are here for. That's also why they put everything in escrow.
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:40:04
Also, keep in mind that once the money is in they can go either direction with the price.
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:38:51
I'm excited. The pullback is certainly expected. With Bakkt opening up it's doors in July I believe that is when the real bull run will occur, unless they delay again as they have several times already.

Oh lawd, time to buy dem BTC. Let's rally the socialites, the yankees, the faschists, all dem mother fuckers.

Is anybody else worried about big institutional investors jumping in the market? Worried about large actors controlling the space entirely. I feel like this happened to a point before the bubble burst.

1. You shall have no other Coins before Me.
2. You shall make no Shitcoins.
3. You shall not take the name of the Bitcoin in vain.
4. Keep the days of the Bull Market holy.
5. Honor thy creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.
6. You shall not destroy Bitcoin.
7. You shall not commit adultery for Bitcoin is pure.
8. You shall not steal thy Holy Coin.
9. You shall not bear false witness against neighboring coins.
10. You shall not covet Bitcoin Cash.
Obey the commandments I have giveth, and the Bulls will be gracious to thou.

What if every person here that is invested in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency bought 10 Bitcoin vinyl stickers and placed them on as many ATMs  in their respective towns as possible?
Even if you can't withdraw Bitcoin from the ATMs, every person withdrawing their dirty fiat will be forced to see the symbol, and might even stop to look it up.

When diversifying, I look for unique projects. I've been in TRON, but it's too similar to other projects not solving anything others aren't, or anything at all from what I can tell. IOTA and XRP are both great. You've already got XRP, so I'd go IOTA if I were you.

WTF is going on with it right now!? Watching it bounce from the range of $4900 - $5300 on Binance. Ironically, it is completely unstable at the moment, haha.

My post was sarcasm. Judging from the down-votes, Reddit didn't quite catch that. \^\_\^'''
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:07:51
False. Bitcoin is slowly heading toward's the value it should have been all along and people will realize this, pulling out money and putting it into altcoins that still have huge gains ahead in their days. Of course, the shitcoins out of those will still die off.

If Anime didn't exist I probably wouldn't.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:19:56
I'm with you. Anime is fantastic for action and offers a lot of depth depending on the shows you watch. I'd much rather watch that than typical American Programming which involves sports, crime shows, and watching overweight people struggle in a reality series that has you questioning who the fuck is funding this shit.

Typical whale moves. Bull run towards target price, sell at target price, dump, buy back in lower, repeat. The good news is this has to happen to move forward. Don't make the mistake of trying to play the market right now, it is certainly dangerous.

In another article, it's already been stated that this bill would not have the chance to pass until the next congress.
