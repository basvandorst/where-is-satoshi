Thomas from WCN was one of the FIRST Bitcoin podcasters that even gave a fuck about Bitcoin enough to talk about it.  His philosophy is where Crypto came from and why ya'll HODL today, because we HODL'd before because of philosophical beliefs of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:56:11
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:08:47
Nah, I think you give him too little credit.  I disagree with your opinion on WCN.  He for sure wasn't the first person to talk about it but he brought it to a much wider audience with his madbitcoins show in a positive and entertaining way on a growing platform Youtube before most back in 2013. He was even the last podcaster that I remember still reporting on Bitcoin back in 2015 when everyone else had given the fuck up and disappeared.

I never said he lied about anything.  He's just pretending to be a crypto expert to "teach" noobs but he's still a real noob himself.  He uses a thing all these dudes do which is pretend to be an expert then sell his viewers a "course" in whatever he's pretending to be an expert on.  In this case it's crypto.  Generally you pay money but don't learn anything more than what you could already get for free.

i'd put this fucker in the scam category.  Most of the "Experts" on crypto don't even have 2 years of research and knowledge under their belt.  That's like half of a bachelors degree in terms of actually knowing wtf they are talking about and i'm betting they know even less.

uhh they don't cost 11 bitcoins and yes but hardware wallets can't get a virus unless you put it on there because it does not connect to the internet and if a hacker has access to it, then why the hell would he put a virus on there instead of just steal the hardware. 
 Windows machines are the LEAST secure place to store your crypto.  All the CIA hacks that were leaked recently, surprise surprise all attack windows machines.

i'm sure it will got to zero, sell now and put your buy at $1
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:45:13
all of this only applies if you sell for FIAT.  trading an asset BCC for another asset BTC is not taxable. you would gain bitcoin at 0 value and when you sell your bitcoin for fiat then you pay taxes on it.  But then you also got to prove which bitcoin you sold, was it the stuff you bought back in 2011 or the shit you just got for free in 2017.

no it cant because the device never uses the key on the windows device so the virus will not be able to see it.  the hardware wallet does all that itself.  plus you also need to press a physical button on the ledger to even send a transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:59:11
