How retarded one has to to be believe this? Isn't that like a $2 trillion market cap?
@_date: 2015-12-05 13:33:34
StartSSL is also accepted, what are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-12-05 16:57:31
You have a reading comprehension problem then.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:59:56
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:01:07
You should upvote this just because it's an awesome attack.
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:51:05
Ross being DPR is not one of them, though.

Are you 5 or something?
@_date: 2015-12-05 13:55:43
Lie? What the fuck are you on about?
@_date: 2015-12-05 13:34:56
Sure! If you can validate google.com as your domain :) 
@_date: 2015-12-05 13:35:48
It works the same way as the other certificate providers, what is so confusing?
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:53:25


Are you 5 or something?
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:29:58


Pretty much.
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:05:48
Yep, breadwallet and multibit are using a different model(SPV ,that is peer-to-peer based) to implement thin clients.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:31:21
Very creative attack, kudos and get fucked 'till you die mothefuckers to those hackers.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:37:10
HOW DARE YOU!!!1
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:56:49
Of course! Because you get bitcoin out of thin air and not by buying them from an exchange!
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:24:03
How would you want the development process to happen?
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:49:15
How do I decline this? You should tip the author, not me.
@_date: 2014-11-24 15:58:54
There is a human version of this, his name is Diego Sanchez
@_date: 2014-08-07 22:40:53
The relevant parts:
These clients communicate with pools over the loosely specified Stratum protocol. Since Stratum communicates over
TCP and contains no form of encryption or integrity, this permits a variety of MITM attack styles such as a strategically
located attacker impersonating a pool or client and easily constructing any message.
Stratum is a JSON based protocol; it defines a total of five unique request and response messages. We analyzed the
miner source code and discovered that several undocumented messages were recognized as well. These undocumented
messages include:
- “client.show_message” which directly records a string into client logs with no sanitization.
- “client.reconnect” which enables a pool to direct a miner to a separate pool with no user intervention required.
These features, coupled with the lack of transport layer security, pose a serious risk to a miner’s system and investment.
For example, **an attacker in the middle of the connection can redirect a miner to their private pool**. The attacker can
then collect the rewards of the stolen processing power.

Nice freudian slip there...
@_date: 2014-08-07 22:42:08
It does not help against this type of attack.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:57:55
I get nothing out of it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:24:33
If the attacker has the ability to serve his custom share blockchain it's basically the same attack as the one discussed in the article.
@_date: 2014-11-22 15:19:30
Electrum itself since it's a thin wallet, it does not download the full blockchain but connects to a remote server.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:54:24
Exactly, it's your choice to look ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:55:55
LOL, I don't think those companies are valued as much as the russian apple store processes in one day. No way they afford to handle that.

What are you smoking?
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:49:16
You must be new on this sub, just yesterday we had a thread about $100,000 for a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:43:51
Very few people here care about the technology behing bitcoin and how the ecosystem can properly grow, the majority are hoarders/wanna be hoarders that are just hoping to get rich.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:49:38
Unfortunately he is...
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:55:51
Of course! Because you get bitcoin out of thin air and not by buying them from an exchange!
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:07:52
Edit: this is a copy/paste from the article, if you want to tip, tip the author not me.
Selfishness and tipping do not mix. Do not tip because you want something, such as increased exposure for Bitcoin. Do not tip someone to get something later. Tip only because you unconditionally want to give something nice to someone else.
Tip only when there is a service that was rendered that is of immediate benefit to you. Do not tip out of sympathy. Human emotions are not denominated in dollars or Bitcoins. No one wants to know that you feel $1 worth of sad.
The tip must be commensurate with the service performed and the utility received. No fractional pennies, in fact, no pennies at all. If you wouldn't pick it up off the floor, don't give it to someone else as a gift. A tip that has a low net present value is downright offensive.
And we live in the here and now. No one cares if you believe your measly one ten thousandth of a Bitcoin will be enough to go to the moon some day. Mark it to market.
Do not tip people who work out of love or passion. Do not tip people who are kind to you. Do not tip anyone just for being themselves, especially if they have lived through an adverse event or illness.
Do not tip people whose accomplishments dwarf yours. Keep in mind that when you're behind a made-up username, you look indistinguishable from the know-nothing-did-nothings and loquacious shills that crowd out social media; "anoncryptoman" is the equivalent of a Victorian street urchin -- do not tip from such an account to someone whose real-world identity is known.
Do not tip people who have dedicated their lives to what they believe is a higher purpose.
Do not tip government employees, accountants, military personnel, and financial officers, who need to keep their finances clean of conflicts of interest.
Do not tip judges, doctors, nurses, EMTs, cops, DAs, professors, construction workers, in fact, any professional of any kind outside the service sector.
Do not tip members of the Night's Watch.
And please, and I'm not making this up, do not tip Oprah!
If you feel that the situation calls for a microtip, do it privately. In cultures with extensive tipping, you always slip the cash discreetly, often through a handshake. Remember, it's a selfless act, neither your ego nor your public perception ought to be involved, so there is no justification to do it publicly.
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:06:23
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:48:54
Because that would have helped how?....
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:12:08
maybe he is a snitch!
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:15:23
That's a stupid thing to say \*looks at the username\* oh carry on, that was expected of you.
@_date: 2014-12-24 09:14:45

Is the connection between the nodes of the p2pool encrypted? As far as I know, it's not.
@_date: 2015-05-03 00:36:26
wtf is this shit?

OMG, he knew about this then! That's why he fled!
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:38:59
Don't be ridiculous, he is DPR and that's not the issue. The issue is if he will get a fair trail or no.
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:47:39


Climate changes all the time you moron.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:07:54
The greed is rotting your brain.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:06:55
Less than 10 I would guess.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:39:23
I am conviced now, wake up sheeple!
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:57:31
Give me a fucking break, you know he is DPR. Take your tinfoil hat off.
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:18:02
But... why?
@_date: 2015-01-17 05:06:04
So if no other currency than bitcoin exists, what is the value of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:51:19
Common sense.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:15:12
So you're saying they sell coins to drive the price down so they can actually buy coins? 
Smart cookie, aren't you?
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:00:27


Pretty accurate if you ask me, what's not true there? 
@_date: 2015-01-17 05:04:39
Some people see it as a currency, most people see it as a commodity and a way to get rich.
But you are right, for bitcoin to properly function as a currency there is not need for it to be valued more that $1.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:05:03
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:14:51
Your mind and soul are rotten.

@_date: 2015-01-28 07:41:29
Another greedy wanker drooling...
@_date: 2014-08-07 23:11:14
Yes, an encrypted connection would have mitigated this.
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:18:08
Are you a security engineer or just talk right out if your ass?
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:00:00


What have you been smoking? This has nothing to do with encryption and bitcoin, this is a about an online drug market. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:18:42
No way this is not a troll.
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:21:39
It depends on the use case.
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:29:45
The rate is more like 1 anarchist: 10 terrorists, they are more dangerous than you think!
@_date: 2016-01-16 11:31:29
Some proof would be nice.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:55:38
Unfortunately, I think you're right.
@_date: 2015-01-17 05:02:42
But bitcoin is money in itself.
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:39:08
You should use TestNet.
@_date: 2015-08-14 10:15:35
It is worth it, someone gave a presentation about this at the latest Defcon.
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:53:59
Obviously for understanding how this new technology works and totally not for buying drugs!
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:28:19
Can you imagine how desperate SF men are that this type of woman can make a living from escorting there?
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:54:39
No need to, he's doing it here.
@_date: 2015-04-03 09:28:09
Probably, I think they meant to say DPR.
@_date: 2015-04-01 02:20:54
This has nothing to do with fungibility.
@_date: 2015-04-29 13:04:42
So where's the lie here?
@_date: 2015-04-01 09:01:13


Show me this distinction in the bitcoin protocol or the network protocol.
@_date: 2015-04-10 09:23:12
Smart folks.

Are you serious? No matter the circumstaces, you don't order a hit!
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:38:39


When you're a state, yes. But not a private entity.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:48:58
False, he's a scumbag that will rot in jail and that's good.
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:20:05
You're delusional if you think Ulbricht is not guilty.
You're delusional if you think setting him free will help bitcoin in any way.
@_date: 2015-03-26 11:54:45
Attack on Tor? What?
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:03:20
According to Google research, 95% of the ransomware bitcoins were cashed out on BTC-E, good riddance!
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:05:04


Why don't bother? Maybe he has no problem giving those..
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:33:46


Yes, talk to your mother, sister and friends, let's make OP rich!
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:43:19
Uuuu, interesting! Thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:28:53
He did not discovered Heartbleed, he just made a page to test if your server vulnerable.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:57:28
Keep dreaming.
@_date: 2015-03-31 04:22:38
Come on, ,his argument was that "The whole case was created by government (see the "inside" SK gov agent) just to discredit the bitcoin in eyes of MSM and rest of the people that still don't understand bitcoin."
