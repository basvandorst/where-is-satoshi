+5% is a dip

Nothing a stupid purchase of shitty alt coin can't solve!
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:56:21
Once other layers are implemented. We will know for sure if blocks adjustments are necessary. 
Remember, the goal is to keep the possibility that anyone can run a node as much as possible.

Really motivated individual there.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:48:22
Can I donate to this project LOL?
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:03:20
My body is ready
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:16:38
Aye! Take my moneeey
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:18:38
That's why we should start counting in bits. But merchants at first will always compare to fiats. I do believe it is a necessary process.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:05:49
It would be great to have it all soon. But you are totally right. Patience will pay out in the end and it has to be well made.
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:24:34
It will probably fold like the DotCom bubble. Thousands of coins will be created. Trillions of dollars will be invested into pure speculation. Once the dream pops, all coins fall and only the strong ones will ever be able to recover and get tremendous gains. 
This is just the beginning, people are placing their "bets". 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:00:07
I always buy a proportional amount of btc relative to fud levels.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:45:18
Or do invest everything you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:12:20
Nan man. Thanks to them I got btc on sale.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:59:43
Will we witness another dip miracle from Roger Ver? Prepare to buy!
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:18:35
If it ever gets to 200k it's prob because you can start buying stuff with it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:56:55
If mcdo would accept BTC. I would use it too.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:51:00
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:29:44
Why have alt coins at all?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:37:44
Fees is just a symptom of a scaling problem. And I'm for 2nd layers solutions before considering blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:35:39
I also like to live dangerously.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:08:50
Yep. We need these guys to show us how resilient BTC can be, no matter what type of attack.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:34:17

Visa trade credits based on fiat. Fiat can be created out of thin air. Need I say more?
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:38:12
I certainly didn't expect the hardfork to be called off a bcash starting to rise..
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:02:36
Wait until their miners do a deal behind closed doors.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:39:28
If people stick to the belief of using this tech to better the world rather than making a quick buck. B2X will fail.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:41:43
I think it's fine. So long as people know what they are buying and selling...
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:39:07
This guy gets it.
Edit: nice name
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:52:27
Sounds like they are the ponzi..
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:50:58
In a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:22:20
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:19:49
Banks shouldn't speculate in buying bitcoin with their customers money... but it does sounds like that's exactly what they do wheb you know at least 80% of your davings they are making a sweet 7% with it...
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:10:17
Holding doesn't mean not spending small amounts. I started asking everywhere I purchase things, if they accept bitcoin. Specifically the places I go often to.  I won't look back if I realize 10 years later that this haircut was 500$. If most of us start converting a confortable pourcentage of our salaries in btc and start asking for items and services be paid in btc, it would make a huge difference. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:42:23
Don't know, don't care. Please Roger Ver, make the price of BTC great again so I can stock up!
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:59:20
Will they really fork? More FUD yes!
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:26:27
No sell only hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:50:47
Thank Roger Ver. Our BTC dip Jesus.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:26:23
They are risking for more centralization for bigger blocks and for a short term fix transaction fees drop. 
Might work in their favor for now but their applied solution is not a true solution to the BTC scaling problems over medium and long term. I would prefer to side with those who want decentralization and real scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:56:44
Simple, everytime they attack.. if it creates a dip, buy it and ignore the fud. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:35:08
Someone got triggered.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:15:52
Man that would be brilliant. I hope they do it. So I can buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:25:54
Running their own would mean a centralized currency, which defeat the purpose. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:52:01
All these posts spam about lighting network are here too. You blind mate?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:08:23
This. 
If you don't have the balls to hodl. We will do it for you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:43:31
You're right. 
No HODL, only buy.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:01:11
comparing alt coins to penny stocks is actually a funny analogy.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:14:07
still over valued..
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:47:27
The other subreddit seems to be pro BCH. Buying BCH is to be believe their solution to scalibility is bigger blocks. This subs mainly thinks is 2nd and 3rd layers for off chain transactions is better.. and I don't believe we are really totally against bigger blocks.. but I think many users would want to see what others layers could offer before we scale the blocks a little. Feel free to downvote or upvote if that make sense or not..
Edit: small edits
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:54:30
But it's low fees man.. same BTC with low fees!! Why you no switch. Look at the dev team, the commits on github, the development. It's young software, I don't want a bunch of CEOs trying to run it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:16:56
Makes you think the deflationary effects of bitcoins will be like having interest rates on your holdings. Except it's real interest. Because no one can print more money to offset that.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:09:45
Dunno about you but I'm erected too this morning.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:58:40
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:49:40
They are right. Lot's of speculation out there. Crypto currencies are here to stay but there will be thousands of cryptos just like there's were thousands of web companies speculating during the dot com bubble. 
That said market cap for all crypto is 220B right now. Dot com bubble reached 1.7 trillion before bursting. 
Edit: was it 2.9 trillion? I might be wrong..
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:51:50
I guess I pick one that runs 0.15.0 or 0.15.0.1 and whenever I plan to do a transaction.. I check the version being run to make sure it's not segwit 2x?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:39:44
Mark Cuban would disagree
