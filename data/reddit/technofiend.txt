Chip and PIN is coming: in October 2015 liability shifts from Mastercard, Visa and American Express to merchants still accepting "swipe and sign" transactions.  There are numerous articles on the web but the Wall Street Journals' recent article [[wsj.com]]( breaks it down pretty succinctly.
**MasterCard’s Carolyn Balfany**
    Part of the October 2015 deadline in our roadmap is
    what’s known as the ‘liability shift.’ Whenever card fraud 
    happens, we need to determine who is liable for the 
    costs. When the liability shift happens, what will change 
    is that if there is an incidence of card fraud, whichever 
    party has the lesser technology will bear the liability.
    
    So if a merchant is still using the old system, they can 
    still run a transaction with a swipe and a signature. But 
    they will be liable for any fraudulent transactions if the 
    customer has a chip card. And the same goes the other
    way – if the merchant has a new terminal, but the bank 
    hasn’t issued a chip and PIN card to the customer, the
    bank would be liable.
I realize a single datapoint doesn't make a trend but all the replacement credit cards I've gotten in the last couple of months have embedded chips,  so it appears the industry is taking the October 2015 deadline pretty seriously.
There's a separate driver in that Windows XP support ended April 8, 2014 and [[cnn.com]]( estimates 95% of US ATMs still run Windows XP. Any ATM that must be upgraded to Windows 7/8/whatever may also see a card reader switch to support chip and pin and possibly check scanning and bill scanning both of which are pretty popular here in the states.

Have you stood in line at a NYC food truck or at Smorgasburg? The lines can be 30 people deep. The **lines** at Halal Guys can be 100+ people.  
If the order line is efficient because people are allowed to order in parallel, then the truck is able to process more customers per hour and although I must wait for my food, less time is spent waiting overall. Up to a point, anyway.  
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:38:12
Dude, I think you just invented a new way for people to queue and order food!
If I can just scan the QR code of a food truck, order my food and wait until my name is called then there's no reason for me to stand in line to order.   
Add the ability to place standing orders (same as last time, please) and get texts when a food truck I like parks near me and you'll have a killer app with or without bitcoin.

You can drop your bitcoin wallet backups on Google Drive.  If you're going to put any valuables on your phone (google wallet, bitcoin, bank clients) make sure to enable two factor authentication and use different, complex passwords for every service.  That includes lockscreen patterns, different pins for every account and google wallet and not enabling "save my user id" on any apps.
The second the phone is stolen, you go into google device manager [[google.com]]( and disable and wipe the device.  Use the backup onetime password you saved at home or wherever to log in to your google account and immediately change your password.

Until this episode aired I was convinced there would in fact never be a season three, with the authors instead trolling fans that it was imminent but never producing anything.

Just be sure to encrypt your linux partition - if it's the standard windows filesystem types (FAT, NTFS), or linux partition (ext_n_, reiserfs, etc) types it is possible to mount and see the files on a windows machine. 
So deny access to Linux partitions from Windows via encryption.

Well you had to redenominate the złotych into the złoty at 10:000 to 1 back in '95, and most folks view entry into the EU as not only trading a volatile sovereign currency for the stronger bloc currency, but also as a signoff that the country's economy is quite strong.
The reality is Poland already joined the EU as a full member in 2004, so you had a pretty strong economy at one time.  What's the chance Poland will be asked now to enforce austerity measures like Spain, Greece and Cyprus did?  And would it make any difference if they used the Euro instead of the złoty?  If the currency doesn't matter, not sure how BTC will make any difference.  Other than the usual arguments in favor of BTC.

I had a linux LDAP server that we debated about rebooting because it was well past the 900 day uptime mark.  The concern was the hardware might fail on reboot.
My Solaris DNS server was rebooted I think 3 times in 3 years, each time because we had to physically move it. 
UNIX / Linux  are mature enough leaking system resources aren't really a thing these days. It's more about whether you can live patch the kernel or need to reboot for to update the OS. 
Yay UNIX.

Sort of the same point as when I was trying to convince people 20 years ago to encrypt their e-mail for even casual use, use strong passwords, not disclose personal information freely, etc, etc. 
Now you have lots of tracking via everything from cookies to warrantless wiretapping.  I realise you're attempting to reject the very notion of casual full time surveillience by inventing ridculous straw-man arguments.  Same as 20-25 years ago when people refused to believe it was possible to monitor every phone call.  If you don't care to believe it, that's fine. It still happens every day.

I know I'm late to the party but this is one of my favorites.
A man dying of cancer asks his three closest friends to each take 20,000 of his money and put it in his coffin at his funeral.  Just in case you really can take it with you.
At the wake the Doctor says guys I have a confession to make, I really wanted to put all the money in, but my free clinic needed a new xray machine so I spent some on that and put in the rest.
The priest clears his throat and says well as long as we're confessing the free daycare we run for our local neighborhood needed a new roof, but I put in what was left!
At this point the lawyer says you two disgust me!  I put in a check for the entire amount.

Well if you look at the stock market, the futures market, the commodities market, insurance market, etc, most financial instruments are regulated to squeeze out the fraudsters.  And if there is somehow fraud there are legal resources. 
 So, your asinine "YOU DON'T SAY" graphic aside generally speaking people can expect **real** offerings to have some validity behind them. Then you have the scam artists working the greed of people who want to get rich quick.  And in the libertarian utopia of course all legal instruments meant to get in the way of scammers are suspect.  Regulation is control and nobody wants that, right?

Well then you should probably go for the cheaper market. I'm not being harsh, but you basically have two camps: 1 - Someone with the skills and will do it because he believes in bitcoin and just wants to advance the technology, 2 - Someone who wants to do it for money.
The 60 BTC tip won't appeal to someone just doing it for the street cred or to advance bitcoin, and it won't be enough for someone to give up making money themselves selling Avalon clones.

Well since bitcoin has the properties of cash, I'm not sure it's relevant?  You can lose it, you can have it stolen from you, you could arguably evade paying taxes, etc.  And it's far harder to get (for the average person) than cash out of an ATM and ATM trips are cited as cash-related cost. :shrug:  Doesn't seem like an argument for bitcoin.

No Such Agency employs (so I've read) the smartest folks they can find and with their money you can assume they are 5-15 years ahead of everyone else.

These devices are encased in stainless steel and have as much as 64kb of memory.  Unfortunately their "digital currency" buttons are woefully out of date and use the SHA-1 protocol which according to Bruce Schneier and others has been shown to have key collisions. Here is [Schneier's original blog post from 2005](
Even so one of their SHA-1 buttons offers on-board SHA-1 based challenge response [DS1963S data sheet]( that is designed for ecash transactions. Their ecash second button is a write-only device.  Edit: It's been a while since I looked at their products,  I see they now offer a write-only RFC smart card in addition to their write-only and secure coprocessor ibutton devices. [Link to their ecash devices page.](
So ultimately it would be nice if Maxim updated the ibutton series to do SHA256, but in the meantime if people want to encrypt and store their wallets offline in a stainless steel canister (update: or nfc-based smart card) which should retain data for 10+ years and is rated to work in -40 to +70 degrees Celsius [full specs here]( these seem useful.

Paper wallet or some protocol that guarantees a phone to phone transaction is immune to double spend or fraud.  WiFi is actually pretty easy to extend over long distances but even so maybe money exchangers of the future will supply connectivity as part of their services.
