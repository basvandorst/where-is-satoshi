No.  But would you rather die 10 years earlier, to go back to 2010?

The Chinese are smart, they won’t dump all their US treasuries. That would tank the other $2 trillion in foreign treasuries they own, destabilizing their Yuan in the process. This isn’t happening, but it’s fun to dream.

It’s down 5% in a day. However much BTC you hold, buy 5% more of that. Problem solved.

Gotta start somewhere! Wish I invested $50 when I was in high school... You’ll be miles ahead of your peers if you invest where you can, and learn other markets like stocks while you are at it to diversify your portfolio. Good luck!

People making money. If you had millions of dollars in bitcoin and saw it reaching a good point to sell you would do it. Then buy some more on the way down. Rinse and repeat like shampoo.

Zimbabwe dollars ended up being an excellent investment. People bought the large notes of them and turned 1500% profits on them selling as collectibles.

Believe what you want. If i was for regulation, I’d just say so, and bitch all day about how we need regulations. I wouldn’t just beat around the bush. I wouldn’t even bother investing in crypto, and I’d go register as a Democrat.

Probably not a good thing no, but people are greedy, especially daytraders. They don’t give a shit whether it’s good or bad. They just see life as short so profit while you can, and buy more Lambo. 
It’s an unregulated market in the Wild West. Without regulation there will never be organic growth, so we have to deal with the violent ups and downs. We’re just on this train along for the ride.

I’m not sure I haven’t been audited for Crypto before. And I have no idea because I’m just holding to avoid headaches. They will probably have outside companies do block analysis and go from there. And if you say “oh well I just sent it to this other wallet I control,” they will say, “excellent just go ahead and show us you still control those specific coins and we can be on our way”.
Who knows, I hope this backfires on the IRS trying to tax it as property. But if I was paying for items and dealing with lots of crypto, I’d be in touch with a crypto tax advisor to figure out my situation. Better than having your head in the sand at least.

You HODL until you want to take profits, don’t have to sell it all. If you HODL hundreds of bitcoin until you die, what was the point haha.

Depends on what you plan to do with it. Personally, I don’t care to swing trade and rack up taxable events. So I transfer my bitcoin to Coinbase Pro and then transfer it to my hardware wallet. Pretty sure normal coinbase charges fees to transfer to a wallet. The way I normally do it is free to transfer.

People probably downvote you because your post comes off as jealousy that you missed out. If you put $4000 in earlier this year, you’d be saying the opposite. But because you didn’t, now it’s a big risk, and therefore you want other people to be like you. Scared money doesn’t make money. 
Yes there’s been hype after hype this year and it didn’t have the power to come close to 20K. That’s not the point of investing, reaching psychological numbers. The point is, how much has your investment returned in percentage points? Has your investment underperformed, met, or outperformed your other investments?
Smart investors know the risk involved. That’s why we manage that risk with other investments; 401K, IRA, Individual stocks, CD’s, fixed income bonds, gold, and if bitcoin outperforms those, it was a risk worth taking wasn’t it. Your truth, is not everyone else’s truth, and that’s why people are going to downvote you, but here’s an upvote.

It would be a taxable event in the US, depends which country OP lives. Taxed at your ordinary bracket. 
“If you disposed of or used bitcoin by cashing it on an exchange or buying goods and services, you will owe taxes if the realized value (the sale price of bitcoin, for example) is greater than the price at which you acquired the bitcoin. You may have a capital gain that’s taxable at either short-term or long-term rates.”

Girlfriend of a year, who gives a shit, you’ll be better off finding someone who values you. You be happy that happened after such a short time and not 15 years in, when you have kids and have to divide up most of your assets, that you worked your ass off for, in a messy divorce. Leaving you with one weekend out of the month visitation with your children. While you eat top ramen to afford your shitty apartment, she’s eating filet mignon with her new man, purchased with your child support money. People actually have to deal with shit like that, so put it in perspective.

As long as you are diversifying your finances in order to have a safety net in any downturn, have an emergency fund, are funding a retirement, and still having some fun while you are still young, yes. If you are putting all your eggs in one basket, living paycheck to paycheck buying bitcoin, and missing out on life experiences because you are doing that, no.

I can just go down the street to a shop and buy some if I’d like now. 
Before when it was decriminalized, you’d buy weed from a dealer you met from someone who knew someone. You’d meet in a parking lot by the local Blockbuster, and the quality and amount would vary. Then if caught with the weed I bought from a dealer, it would get confiscated, I’d get a ticket, and a notice to appear before a judge. 
Where I’d be handed down a fine and community service. Im sure where it’s illegal you get jail time or probation. It wasn’t really very much fun buying weed back then.
