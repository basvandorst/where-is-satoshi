Personally I just have a paper wallet, you don’t even need a dumb printer, just make one and write down the two keys with pen and paper, but there are some much better ideas already in the comments.

Nicehash has a “profitability calculator” which will tell you if your current pc is capable of making anything, if it is you can install their program and mine as part of a larger pool, people essentially rent your computing power. While that is running and (hopefully) making you a (likely very small) profit, read up everything, find out about the different algorithms, the different coins and what they are each trying to achieve, watch YouTube videos and talks and get clued up on what it takes to mine, what to do if there is a fork, etc.

You could but then you lose money, your choice at the end of the day but losing 10% compared to holding on and gaining 10% a few years later? I know which I’d chose, it’s why everyone says to hodl, don’t cut your losses, wait until your back in the black before pulling out, and if you can’t afford to lose it then you should invest in something more stable

If I were you I’d maybe put in something like $100 a month, not $600, if you can afford to lose it all, put it on bitcoin, if you can’t afford to lose it, don’t buy bitcoin.
Looking at past bubbles you can see that it peaks, drops suddenly, then slowly continues to move down and down over a few years, levelling out, then another bubble comes, just because it hasn’t gone below 3k in a while doesn’t mean in 4 years time it won’t be and your investment will have lost money. Personally I think it will keep falling slowly for the next 2-3 years before levelling out but no one knows what bitcoin will do, maybe the next bubble will be the end of this year, maybe it will be 8 years away, either way, mathematically you are better off taking the average, putting money in on a regular basis, regardless of the current price or where you think it’s going, and when another bubble comes, selling.
Now is a good time to be interested in getting into and investing, it is a lot more stable now than this time last year, but don’t be disheartened if it takes a decade to reap any reward, play the long game, bitcoin is still a very young currency in comparison to most, and blockchain technology is the new buzzword in tech, like I said though if you can’t afford to lose your entire investment, don’t put money in.

My driving instructor asking “what actually is bitcoin?” As we drove past an ATM (just a regular fiat one) being installed. NE of the UK

Half and half, I put some money in a while back and I still trade with that, buying the lows and selling the highs, but I keep the profits I make in a different wallet which I won’t be touching for about 20 years (waiting till my kids hit 18 before deciding what to do with it), sometimes if I do overtime at work or something I’ll put a bit extra into that long term wallet, enough to make it a decent sum, not so much that I feel my time would be wasted if I lost it all.
Usually if I see somewhere that accepts bitcoin for purchases I’ll buy some on the spot with Coinbase just to pay with bitcoin, just because I can, suppose that counts as trading? Given I need to pay for miners fees and the Coinbase fee and I’m shifting value between fiat to crypto then the company will shift it back to fiat to pay people’s wages with.

With a small amount yes, and keeping a larger amount off any exchange and in a private wallet in case they go all MtGox on me.

Visit noandt.com and tell me if you think they have anything to do with bitcoin and mtgox.
