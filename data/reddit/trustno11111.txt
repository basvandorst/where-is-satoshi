Interest rates are well below inflation guy.  Take a look at the last decade... most banks were paying 0.01% interest.  My bank currently pays 2%, too bad inflation is 2.2% yoy.  Also don’t forget you pay income tax on that interest!

It’s well established that risk tolerance increases as your income and savings grow.  The lower your income, the less likely you are to be invested at all.  There’s a reason why the majority of Americans own no stocks at all you clueless child.  I bet mommy and daddy still help pay your monthly expenses.

Yawn.  Go learn about how inflation works kid.

Savings is not investment, dumb fuck.  People like you who conflate the two are fucking retarded.  Most of the country consists of blue collar wage earners who have to work for a living.  These people risk their health and their time earning a wage, and typically don’t make enough to have the risk tolerance to also invest.
People like you, who have the luxury of being able to invest, made bank thanks to the federal reserve.  Their policies were essentially welfare for trust fund babies.  Meanwhile, the working class was forced to bear the burden and cost of the financial crisis.
Fuck you for perpetuating the bullshit line of thinking that investment is the same as saving.  Some of us risk enough simply earning the money we have.  We’d like to be able to save what we’ve earned without having to loan it to financial parasites on Wall Street and expose ourselves to even more risk.

I’m not the one stalking people.  Go ask mommy and daddy for some more money.

Sure, pre 2008 that was mostly true.  After 2008, the fed set out to control the full curve of interest rates.  The only way to pay for the mess of 2008 was to devalue everyone’s savings and wages.  There’s a reason Bitcoin was invented at this time.
If you kept your savings in the best CD money could buy over the last decade, you lost roughly 2% per year (assuming you believe the official inflation rate... which there is plenty of reason to be skeptical of).  2% per year over a decade is roughly a 35% loss in purchasing power.
No disagreement that if you were invested in financial assets like stocks you made out like a bandit thanks to the fed.  However, it’s a mistake to conflate savings with investment.  The two serve totally different purposes in an economy.  The fed made sure anyone who was a risk averse saver or a wage earner lost big over the last 10 years.
