Thanks for the reviews, enjoy the 2mBTC.

And there you go, thanks!
Edit: We do!

Looks interesting I will give it a test.

We're working on it!
PS: We're still running a promotion giving away 2mBTC for the first 100 reviewers.

I can't wait to see Wiki allowing Bitcoin donations.

While there's no perfect way to identify them, we do have several plans (in addition to standard moderation to filter obvious shills) for when this starts to become an issue.
One of which would be to weigh reviews based on how trustworthy the reviewer is. This could be based on having confirmed facebook/twitter, and building up trust in other methods.
How well these will this work? I honestly have no clue, but we're going to try everything we can think of to try and make it work.
Sorry for the delayed response.

This is a neat way to promote adoption I hope more business that we can pledge to get on the site soon.

I thought that was odd as well as it happened to me a few days ago but didn't think too much of it.

Sent, thanks.

User uniqueness would likely be a very helpful data point when making the weighting feature.

This is a great point, our answer is that we will be as transparent as possible for what moderation actions we do take. (And we will have to for spam and other reasons)
We also welcome competition which would serve to keep one another honest.
