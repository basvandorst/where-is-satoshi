ever since bitcoin broke $10k it hasnt really found its sweet spot yet. its literally a rollercoaster right now.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:22:33
apparantly someone is  happy to pay because since they got high at the start of december they havent gone down which is odd. you would think that people started doing less transactions, maybe use other crypto where possible and even optimise btc transactions by using segwit and sending out in batches making fees go down. but nope everything just stays the same it seems people pay silly high fee and dont care. but honestly  i think its someone with too much money pushing up fees to redicolous levels obviously cant continue forever but could last months, its effectively a siege, bitcoin is the castle and the spammer is trying to starve everyone inside.

it depends. a recieving adress at an exchange can expire. so dont just send to the same one, always check if its still valid first.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:44:40
It is possible but its not very practical. fees will most likely go down to sub $1 in the near future tho, so that will enable some of that dust to consolidate into a more effecient utxo.

this guy spamming the chain is serious. his shenanigans cost $5M per day and its been going on since december 8th. I noticed ethereum is recieving huge amounts of tx as well and its more expenaive than ever to use and alot of people have their transactions stuck. Its probably someone with alot of ripple.

You can use CME to hedge your bitcoin. This is better than sending them to an exchange and selling them if you are concerned about a dip.
So being long term bullish and building a big BTC stash just got safer, so i suppose this is bullish.

i think looking at who is against segwit is more relevant. Off the top of my head we have jgarzik, whose points have been refuted, we have roger ver, but who has come out and said he is agnostic so he is niether for nor against. then you have viabtc which is an angry chinese hotshot who thinks they can come from the corporate chinese telecom market and tell everyone whats best for bitcoin. etc.
where is the criticism of segwit that really makes it fall apart. there is no such thing afaik.

It is incorrect to not consider segwit a scaling feature. 
1. it enables bigger blocks
2. it makes bigger blocks safer and leaner 
3. it paves the way for aggregated signatures. a big deal when it comes to scale and fungibility.

@_date: 2017-08-18 15:54:23
Imo its all just hype. People go from coin to coin. First they hyped alt-coins because they had faster blocktimes, then they hyped alt-coins because "muh smart contracts" now they hype altcoins because muh mining profitibality. Its just hype designed to pump the coin. Chances are bcash will slowly become irrelevant once the hype wears down. And i would argue it has peak hype right now, so really its only down hill from here. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:12:53
Its not possible without consequences. ViaBTC tried making a tx fee accelerator (Which is basically a small amount of free blockspace) but it just ends up being clogged up. Its literally a lottery if you get in and it makes fees go slightly up for everyone else..

Can i just. Nice joke. It gets a point across.
But devs are not in control. They dont have any buttons to push. However, we can run their software, which interacts with the bitcoin network.
So. Even if we chose to run Core or BTC1. The network will still be on another version, the devs cant control whats out there. Not currently at least..  (Maybe there will be a version at some point with auto updates or code that can be influenced by devs remotely, and maybe this version will become predominant on the network and thus devs will be able to control it, but i doubt it) Have a nice day.

You are only saying this because you dont want to pay fees. Next you are going to argue how bitcoin should not have halvings so miners can continue being paid with Block rewards. God forbid you had to pay anything directly for enjoying the benefits of bitcoin.

Its amazing how sluggish that project is. You really gotta put alot of energy into making them do the right thing. It was the same thing with BIP91 huge discussion and back and forth for getting them to it, even tho it was obviously the best way. 
And now this replay protection issue, what is the matter with them? Why is it so hard to just do the right thing, and why must there be such a push to get them to do it? Amazing

First of all, i am not the guy you originally replied to. And second of all i probably should have been clearer.

@_date: 2017-08-23 18:35:39
It will be interesting how this plays out. Having 90% of the hashrate does not make it safe because hashrate is profit driven. Who knows what they will mine in 3 months time. Bitcoin? Bitcoin Cash? or the SegWit2x hardfork. Of all the 3 i think SegWit2x looks like its going to be the least profitable. This can change if more people begin supporting it, but why would they?
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:23:27
you figure that one out. certainly, the person that does could end up making alot of money.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:58:02
without replay protection nobody will support segwit2x. how will shapeshift handle the lack of replay protection come fork?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:48:26
Im not moving the goal post.
1. It remains to be seen if it can handle 8x more transactions
2. IF it can, 8x more is nothing in the grand scheme of things
8x or Bcash or whatever you wanna call it is just a bailout so it doesent solve the problem. You are aware of the problem with bailouts right? They spoil everyone and prevent the neccesary changes to a more sustainable path.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:43:56
Someone is spamming so the fees are high right now. It doesent help that antpool doesent fill up their blocks and half the hashrate went to bcash. It wont be long until the madness stops and bitcoin returns to normal tho.

it costs bitpay nothing to use bitcoin, there is no expense to be passed on to merchants in that regard. This is why they think bitcoin is great. But when the fee pressure show up their market segment (coffee, game purchases etc) slowly get priced out. So their stupid idea is to increase blocksize and remove fee pressure because that helps their buisness they think. But it weakens bitcoin, so it may end up hurting their buisness anyway. What they should do is give people a deposit adress, then i can send $300 for example to it. And then id use that wallet when i wanted to use bitcoin to pay for a game or a coffee etc. They would have their own off-chain system that woukd be fast, flexible and they would have full control. Its so stupid they havent done it.

Ironically we now need something along the lines of how paypal is today, for bitcoin.
Why? Because its more flexible, and can have much lower fees than on-chain transcactions.
Because there is less regulation and less banking overhead etc. for bitcoin it is also expected that a Paypal style. off-chain, bitcoin transaction will be significantly cheaper than a traditional paypal USD transaction.

Not sure what you mean by that. Competition in what regard?
Bitcoin Core proposed a softfork last year, it would raise blocksize to about ~2mb. But it didnt get activated until now. Maybe because litecoin added it, and that gave bitcoin competition so miners couldnt continue fucking around.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:45:07
isnt he supposed to dump his BCH for bitcoin? BCH has no network effect, no infrastructure or anything. If he can get $2,500 for it, and bitcoin is also $2,500 at that point in time he is making a bad decision by converting to 100%BCH 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:55:02

They are sabotaging bitpay more than bitcoin. Because when fees go up because antpool mine empty blocks people stop doing smaller transactions like buying a steam game etc..
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:10:14
Ok im sorry for not predicting the top to the excact minute
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:05:12
You cant. It have little infrastructure and merchant adoption etc. If it get its, fees will go up too!
People need to understand that crypto is a really early stage, and most people just like to pump and dump. But we need infrastructure for this thing to last (Boring and takes work am i right, who want to deal with that /s), but we cant rely on on-chain transactions for the next 8 years like we did for the first 8. So stop complaining and stop pumping and dumping and start developing the infrastructure that will actually allow cheap transactions and bitcoin to be a thing in 9 years as well.
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:19:43
Have they specifically said NO or have they just not said yes? 
Its important. Because otherwise you are using them politically to further your own agenda, do not do this, because you could end up having them make the wrong choice out of spite. So please stop. Sometimes being quiet is best. Please correct me if im wrong.

This just proves their ignorance.. That whole agreement is basically a yolo. They hardly got economic majority to sign and they even got significant refusals (Kraken, bitfinex etc.). But they decided to go ahead and release the agreement anyway and say "hey guys we are forking 3 months after segwit activates, do or die". Its completely rekless and shortsighted. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:10:43

I dont grok how you can have a cryptocurrency without full nodes. For example if bitcoin didnt have full nodes and bcash didnt have full nodes, what defines the coin? 
What are the miners actually mining, what are they switching between?
Non mining full nodes only seem appealing because it seems simpler, but not sure how it would work. We are supposed to connect to miners and they tell us the story? How can you have a multi billion asset based on that? And wont it just be shut down by gov?

The only thing they accomplish is removing the fee pressure, and that can be considered a downgrade from the protocols perspective. Im sure bitpay prefers it because they can continue exploiting the blockchain for free. Sigh

There are people who hold because they think its a reliable store of value. Its digital gold to them.
Besides, the mass adoption isnt going to come from on-chain use, since on-chain transactions scale poorly.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:36:10
soon paypal accepted = bitcoin accepted because they will support bitcoin

Probably most people dont care strongly about anything and go through their lives just being indifferent. Thats whats ridiculous if you ask me. These people also dont like people who care because it makes them look bad. Anyway im out!

Doesent seem so bad. Also curious what the point of having a bitmain account is.
*edit* im not endorsing the hack in any way and im not insinuating that people should not have a bitmain account. 
*edit2* Im just curious why people make a bitmain account. Whats it used for?

they are not even captains of industry. they have first mover advantage which gives them a  massive advantage.

They are better off making an actual transaction system thats suitable for buying coffee instead of changing bitcoin into something that can temporarly do that. On top of that bitcoin on-chain transactions are rather clunky. I got no clue why people think they are so great. We **need** off-chain systems now with instant confirmation and low fees.

@_date: 2017-08-23 19:45:18
You are right, i did edit my post, my apologies. 
But to elaborate on the first post, 8x more transactions is nothing in the grand scheme of things yet it comes with pretty annoying drawbacks. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:33:36
no. they use on-chain transactions and end users need their own wallets and set manual fees and shit. its clunky as fuck.
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:30:55
If its a state attack its expensive. And whats the worst they can do? Bitcoin price collapses? People will just buy the dip and it will go up again.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:01:33
The amount of greed in this space is at an all time high. can you believe people are actually buying bcash at this level?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:40:16
You are misleading your audience if you are telling them that on-chain transactions can be used for every day transactions.

1. Nobody really knows how to increase blocksize of the bitcoin network in a safe and decentralized manner (Except with segwit)
2. Increasing the blocksize removes the fee pressure but fees are needed to pay miners, but also as an incentive to use on-chain transactions conservatively so the blockchain size doesent get out of control so you dont want bigger blocks right away even if you could
3. Its not just about increasing the blocksize, its about what to increase it to and what the step after blocks become full again is. Nobody can give a straight answer yet so raising blocksize is pretty much just a knee-jerk thing which is why some people dont like it even if it was possible.
4. The larger the blocks are the more stressed the network becomes etc.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:48:00
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:14:56
They didnt fix quadratic hashing afaik. If diff keeps dropping it will be trivial for bitcoin miners to drop 8mb quadratic blocks which will stall the chain. That attack is cheaper than 51%
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:27:57
Please keep in mind that Core devs cant do this alone, altho they probably think they can! The more help and support the better

Ye and even if bitcoin cash overtakes bitcoin in cumulative work and we ignore its asicboosted™ it would only lead to confusion if people start calling Bitcoin Cash bitcoin. Its kind of stuck with its name now. Besides, name isnt that important i would argue.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:08:54
The only value that other coin has is people who fomo because zomg it will take over bitcoin. This happens again an again in crypto. Dogecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash. People want the sensation of buying a coin cheap and then getting 100x returns. Too bad that Bitcoin Cash is terrible and everyone who buy it is gonna be a bagholder.

Who is claiming btc1 is claiming they are Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:49:06
No, we cant be "forced", but they are trying to make themselves look like they are bitcoin, so they are scammers.
But without adding replay protection they are pursuing a mutually assured destruction tactic. So now that i think about it, they are trying to "force" the network to change to their version. But i think its futile.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:37:31
Do you disagree that BTC1 is harmful? I am happy to hear your case and stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:31:03
How so?

probably because it was a shitpost
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:37:24
Nothing, but you will never be able to get that with on-chain transactions. On-chain transactions will always be a bottleneck. If you want cheap and fast transactions you should not be into crypto, or at least you should be looking to use second layers. (Which dont yet exist, but why this crypto currency is still in very early stage)

This is actually a clever narrative people who try to split bitcoin is spreading. They imprint the idea that Core is in control and the lack of scaling is on purpose so as to sow dissent. But if Core was in control we would have had scaling already.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:29:33
Thats a good point. But thats a very niche issue, and since the consensus for the hardfork is very weak, they are endangered alot more funds by going ahead and doing it because they most likely going to crash the price.

Right. This is crypto. Someone can pump your coin out of nowhere. Yesterday bitfinex recovery right token got pumped 300% just because. It makes 0 sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:42:45
Thats true. They can also decide wether to mine Bcash or not. But theyd only do it if its profitably enough for them. So they dont really decide anything. The hodlers does.

Yes. Its the worst way to do a split. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:08:28
Well we can try making on-chain transactions cheap by expanding blocksize, but its not a good solution. Best to just accept that on-chain transactions are a bottleneck and unless theres some fundamental innovation will stay that way. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:17:34
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:54:19
Erik what is your pursuit here? Do you actually want whats best for bitcoin and the people involved, or are you just being stubborn because you originally supported 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:22:54
Thanks. Turns out they used Pieter Wuille and Johnson Lau's work to fix it.

Eh ok, what changed?
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:50:15
Right, but this is not an easy problem to solve. Next week there will be more blockspace available, and hopefully the spam will stop.

Can you elaborate? How will they profit?
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:46:36
Just another reason we need off-chain tx

tl;dr SegWit2x is delibarately being harmful and noone is going to run it
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:49:23
I think its true. For example to shrink the blockchain. Do we really need 20 years of history etc. but of course its only possible if it can be done in a decentralized way. So far all hardforks have centralized activation mechanisms. (Devs saying we are hardforking and the new chain is it.)

@_date: 2017-08-23 19:17:09
Actually it still needs to prove it can handle 8x more transactions
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:16:45
SegWit2x never had the moral highground.
They keep referring to a 5 month old agreement between a few companies as if its the law.
But end of the day the software is hostile and harmful in its current form.
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:16:52

@_date: 2017-08-21 11:16:55
If BCH becomes longer than bitcoin that will forever kill the argument that Longest chain = bitcoin because Bitcoin Cash is obviously not bitcoin. Not even if its longer.
Also, these miners gotta be laughing all the way to the bank when they sell their BCH at these prices :D

What do you think about your south american rivals?
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:30:59
Since its so reckless i have a hard time thinking they will do it. But now that theres bitcoin cash the miners are probably thinking well if we fuck up bitcoin we can always mine bitcoin cash
As to why they wanna fuck up bitcoin? Miners are probably power tripping, who knows.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:07:38
I wonder if you understand how bitcoin works? hardforks are different chains by definition, even if they clone the blockchain. everyone would have to update to support it or chose to trust the miners which imo is a kind of big security issue.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:31:58

The question is wether or not bigger blocks are safe.

Im concerned the market cap is growing too fast. But then again nothing like crypto has ever existed before.

Oh come on
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:36:36
At first it will scale by pricing out smaller transactions. Then busisneses and end users will optimise their use of blockspace and at the same time there will be technology such as Schnorr signatures that makes transactions smaller.
At the same time cryptocurrencies is still kind of new and research and development is still underway. So although there is not a specific path to scaling right now, things become clearer as people learn, invent and build scaling solutions over time.
Tl;DR how will bitcoin scale? With time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:00:39
If they deploy their BCH they sell it but there wont be buyers because they were the buyers

this is like when dogecoin first appeared. you had these people spamming social media telling everyone how much better dogecoin was than bitcoin. it was really annoying, but it also paid off. Dogecoin pumped, people made their money, and then they sort of abandonded the project. Now its trading at 20 satoshis per coin afaik.

No, calling your altcoin "Bitcoin Cash" is childish and petty.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:36:09
ETH is overvalued. Why? Because if BTC didnt exist ETH value would be 0. ETH is driven by the idea that it will be worth more than BTC. I dont know what it will take for ETH to go to 0 where it belongs, maybe a good hard crash in BTC to knock some sense into everyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:42:07

Why not keep the debt and sell your BTC slowly to pay it off in small bits? You dont know how far this thing can go, so why try to predict the top? Just go with the flow.
That being said, if BTC crashes tomorrow and never reaches this level again, you did the right thing. But why would it crash and then stop going up?

Big blockers are the worst people ever.
They claim that big blocks is the most important thing ever, ignoring the fact that Bitcoin has soared from $250 to $10,000 while they have been complaining.
Then they hardfork and create their own fork and they INSIST on calling it Bitcoin. Why? If big blocks is the most important thing it shouldnt matter what they call their cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2017-11-11 10:48:19


Well, what are you waiting for?
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:30:04
the two biggest reasons are that a store of value is needed and its price is basically uncapped, you also have the problem that on-chain transactions dont scale. So if cryptocurrency is good for anything its scarcity and censorsnip resistance, store of value, settlements. Build the transaction systems on top.

This is not true, look at the UASF and NO2X campaigns. Software developers only mean anything to the extend that people wish to run the software. If the network will rally to reject a proposal coming from bitcoin buisnesses, a "Proposal" coming from government, that is even more mallicious, will not be a problem regardless of which devs endorse it? imo. Thats the whole point of decentralization.

Ive never heard anyone complain about the services bitcoin.com offers. But they carry a huge premium afaik. This is to be expected on a domain like that since its where alot of the noobies go when first getting into bitcoin so they dont know any better.
However, the person who owns the domain is a controversial figure who is too involved with protocol development. The problem is he is not qualified but insist on telling everyone whats best for bitcoin, even tho he have screwed up in the past when he decided to endorse a failing exchange to the detriment of everyone who followed his advice.

If UASF resulted in a chain split and UASF did not have a satisfying amount of hashrate they would have changed PoW. This is the sort of thing that miners obviously dont want to happen.

@_date: 2017-09-05 14:58:04
They should be ashamed for using the bitcoin blockspace for this kind of consumerism. Downvoted.
Bitcoin is about freedom, saving up and high value and *meaningful* transactions and here you have merchants using it so that they can sell an extra camera to a person who will never use it, but dont know what else to do in his life other than consume. Thats what he makes him happy. But in reality he is an addict. When the satisfaction of having bought something new goes away, he will buy something new again. His habitat will be full of stuff he doesent use, and the irony is it makes him more depressed realising hes got all this stuff, that he dont use, that he feels he should use, it makes him more depsressed so he has to buy even more stuff to compensate. Its a mental disease and its wasting a ton of resources, including blockspace. That is all.
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:30:18
it might be better to use bits. 100 satoshi = 1 bits. sort of like 100 cents = 1 dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:15:57
there is only so much hashrate. it cant be everywhere at once. the chain that is most likely to be mined even if its unprofitable is the original chain since thats the one that has all the value, but again, thats why i think it will be the one thats most profitable.
by the way the miners dont know whats good for themselves. its crazy that they want to hardfork bitcoin with no consensus. idiots. but honey badger wont care.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:41:57


It wasnt one fix. It fixed several things.


Its not a feature of the code, having satelite nodes is a feature in and of itself. 


But the point is that BTC is innovating. For example Ethereum lacks  many features that BTC has.. Such as an adress format with a checksum that reduces funds loss. BTC has this :D
So i rest my case. Altcoins are hype and marketing, the real innovation and improvements happen by and large on BTC. But if you like altcoins just buy them. Go all in. You arent fooling anyone but yourself tho.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:00:14

I would like to see that calculation. Increased orphan risk incentivises miners to mine under a single pool. And larger blocks increases orphan risk, do you agree with that? Increased orphan risk also increases incentives to spy mine and do all kinds of "optimizations" that reduces the reliability of the protocol.

because the companies claim they speak for the users. they claim they have consensus. but its clear they dont, and this will help them make a better decision.
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:00:44
Theres several reasons
bigger blocks create an incentive to centralize mining
bigger blocks removes the incentive to pay for transactions
every transaction has to be validated by current participants as well as all future participants so only the absolute most important transactions ought to take place on-chain
theres more to it than that. you could probably write a book about it. but obviously i dont have time for that right now :)

Thats a silly question, why would all miners move to a fork?
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:37:16
But check this out.  &gt;75% of all coins have already been mined. There is not alot left.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:29:48

the whales exploited the uncertainty about bcash when it was just launched to pump it to extreme heights. it was a one time possibility. bcash is now showing its true colors and it will be harder to pump.
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:31:36
it doesent really matter? bitpay is the one taking a risk as far as i can tell. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:50:18
Its completely reckless and disaappointing people support S2X
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:30:00
It works the other way tbh. People who chase profit are not going to think a coin that trades at $3,000 is interesting. They want the ones that trade for less because it seems like they have bigger upside. And this probably explains 90% of people who buy bitcoin cash. They think it will go to $3,000 because bitcoin did. But this may not be the case.
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:27:55
the people listed dont actually have an argument. i mean what is roger vers argument? and what is gavin andresens argument? etc.
they dont have any
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:13:25
Fair enough. I only see BTC as one of the ones that will last tho. But what do i know.
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:23:10
The trick here is to get above $4,000 again. That would be so fucking strong imo

Thank you. I guess it needs to be said. But when he says the NSA bought ebay for 8 billion thats when you know its conjecture :) But its still interesting, and has alot of connections to whats happening in BTC from my perspective:) Not the part about buying ebay but the part about splitting the community and so on.

Electrum is more of a cold storage solution (People do few tx with it) i dont expect it to bump that much. Wait until for example start using it, THEN it will spike :P
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:30:11
Its an altcoin you know that? What is majority.hashrate going to change? At best they can attempt to attack a chain by starving it from hashrate but do you know how far out that is? And its an attack that is only possible on BTC, due to the relatively long difficulty readjustment scheme. Ie. it can be fixed. But you have to. wait until they attack if they attack because its a very low probability and you cant get network to update otherwise. You and others who say hashrate is king is basically spewing nonesense.
Tl;dr id like to see miners try to dictate the consensus rules, it will be their own funeral
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:23:52
bitcoin cash is only being mined by a minority of hashrate. you can see bitcoin difficulty rising and rising since bcash was created. its obvious which one miners prefer and are adding hashpower to. bitcoin cash on the other hand keep oscilating around the same level, its just being mined by a few zealots.
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:06:00
Why do you call it bitcoin segwit?
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:02:03
Yea? That doesent mean they will do it. Thats why they are signalling. If they really controlled consensus they would just fork
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:48:16
I would like to add you have to read the small print in order to understand the situation because they list the price in BTC and LTC giving the impression they take those as payment BUT:


BTW. does this mean i can pay with [Bitconnect]( 
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:12:21
This will be fixed in the future.
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:01:02
but the exchange dont pay the fees on those so the incentive is still not 100% there. however once the first exchange start advertising segwit the others will follow i imagine because of competjtion.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:58:26
why not do both
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:26:08
great post. By the way off-topic, did you see the mystery miner has lost 70% of his money from holding bitcoin cash rather than selling it? that has got to sting.

So let fees rise until we know how to scale this thing.
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:32:22
that stagnation is completely made up. Bitcoin price is VERY high, public perception is good, segwit is deployed and there is room for blocks twice as big as they are right now. What is this stagnation he talks about?

Do you really think S2X has consensus? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:55:52
i dont think it makes sense to hold several cryptos. if you want exposure to crypto just hold bitcoin. why? because altcoins mimic bitcoin sentimemt so if btc is about to crash so will alts. if btc is about to moon so will alts. you might as well just hold bitcoin. set it and forget it as they say.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:34:21

this is why i like the ecb over others. its a decentralized central bank. it doesent belong to one country. 
however, EU could fuck bitcoin up good
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:28:36
Maybe, maybe not. The sooner segwit is deployed and its larger blockspacd utilized the sooner a possible hardfork to increase it further could be made.

@_date: 2017-10-13 14:35:01
its the fear of missing out. everyone is buying because the price is rising and that makes even more people buy which makes the price rise even faster. its incredible.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:16:04


This wont work.


Theres no guarantee this will be the outcome. I immediately think of Bitcoin Cash who thought it was no big deal to just implement an emegency difficulty adjustment. -20% difficulty when the time between blocks become too long. But they fail to understand the full ramifications of this change and how it plays in with the rest of the protocol and not to mention the adverserial environment crypto currencies operate in.
Its the same thing with people who think that blocksize limit can just be a config option among nodes and miners. Its not that simple. Now you are probably wondering why i dont explain what the problem is, but whos got time for that? This is a complex subject and im not getting paid to post on reddit or poke holes in these things. And even if i did it wouldnt change anything. Bitcoin is what it is.

@_date: 2017-09-28 01:36:30
a second blocksize increase so soon is a bad idea. its also impossible to roll out in time? i mean as far as i can see there is no consensus for s2x, because consensus should have scientific merit, its not enough for miners or certain companies to say we want x, therefore it should happen. they need to give a good reason why at least. if they cant give a good reason there can never be consensus.

no its not. you are a victim of the altcoin marketing machine.
in reality bitcoin is at the cutting edge of this space, segwit, ln, the client is rock solid and syncs fast compared to the size of the blockchain, and so on. it fucking has satelites in space relaying blocks. a new adress format has just been merged to Core, bech32.. when is the last time an altcoin improved their adress format. i cant believe you.

But here is the thing, there wont be a fork
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:58:36
Indeed. The value of each coin will drop but you will get many more coins. A benefit of that is that some people might buy again. I think bitcoin seems expensive to alot of people right now and it may prevent them from buying.

Im sorry but you are describing a system that is bad. Miner 1 decides to make a huge block that miner 2 dont accept. Chain splits. Meanwhile the node im sending coins to are on the same chain, but later it turns out miner 2s chain becomes the valid one, and then what?

In many ways SegWit2x is just phantom. But i guess we will know in november wether Hashrate just gonna start mining it. I dont think they will. This signalling is just the hashrate way of saying fuck you and try to scare people. In the end i dont think they have an incentive to proceed with the fork so they wont.
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:39:25
No point in adding EDA (also not possible tbh due to network alrrady deployed), if all hashrate leave and never comes back so be it :) Bitcoin dies.

@_date: 2017-09-27 17:00:51
Time flies in crypto space. Probably in May they thought 6 months lead time for a hardfork was enough. But as we can see that is way too rushed. I wonder if they will abandon the fork or actually proceed :D Things are gonna get interesting. Either way i cant say i give them much respect.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:23:16
you cant have unlimited blockspace. so if you dont have an auction, for example first come first serve, you will have less flexibility as an end user etc. and spamming the blocks could make the network come to a complete halt. This time the spammer was simply outbid until he stopped, its a great concept.
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:41:36
Yes this is how these people operate. They are also mining Bcash at a loss, hoping it will go up.. They are also propping up the price hoping people will fomo in.
These people are all going to go bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:50:22
I have to be honest, i dont think a soft limit changes much. For example Ethereum has a soft limit, but miners dont raise it? Blocks are full. 
I mean we can keep arguing about blocksize or we can come to the realisation that it doesent matter. Most/All the activity will take place on second layer systems if Bitcoin is to go mainstream. Not only because its more scalable but also because its simply more convenient. You get more flexibility etc.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:05:34
You are free to do so but it will make you incompatible with the network. Its not something Core controls.
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:33:14
BCH is not decentralized. Its difficulty algorithm doesent even work. If miners truly followed the incentives the coin would get rekt. BCH holders are basically at the mercy of the two miners whos been mining since the beginning. They hasnt even sold a single coin yet and they got 50k coins stocked up. The fact people are willing to hold Bitcoin Cash under these circumstances show how powerful of an idea Cryptocurrency has become but also what a big bubble its in. I would not want to hold bitcoin cash during the downtrend. The collapse could be immense.
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:16:29
Thats so awesome. But what are the ramifications of having your coins in bech32? Then you can only send to SegWit compatible adresses, am i right? Or am i missing something?

People have been calling bitcoin specifically a scam since the start. But i just think they dont understand it. 
I do think that other crypto currencies have elements of scams to them. Particularly they try to exploit peoples lack of knowledge of the space and saying things like "This is better than bitcoin, its gonna go up like crazy" and stuff like that. But when you research them, it turns out they have elements that are worse than Bitcoin. So claiming they are better and going to overtake it and stuff is scammy.

@_date: 2017-10-07 07:16:45
There are many issues with it. First of all its a hardfork. I thought thise were supposed to be nearly impossible. Second of all a dumb blocksize increase sets a precent that thats how its gonna be. buisnesses wont innovate or optimize they will just continue consuming more and more blockspace and demand bigger and bigger blocks. but the downside to bitcoin is that everyone has to validate all transactions, even the ones in the past. This obviously becomes a bigger and bigger burden as time goes on. There is still alot more to why S2X is a bad idea but i simply dont feel like explaining it. It takes too long. But if you really wanted to learn you should spend some time on google.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:56:16
I think the idea is the same. How are you going to explain the blocksize debate to anyone? You will have to write a book

@_date: 2017-09-30 15:24:18


No? If something bad happens to BTC the space will become a joke in most peoples eyes.


These communities are fundamentally built on the idea to be as big and popular as Bitcoin. If bitcoin dies so does their communities. You can see this play out right now with Ethereum following Bitcoin. Its not a hedge.
if you dont believe me, here are the two side by side 
You can see the Ethereum had a more aggresive pump because of the ICO and ENS hype which did retrace significantly. 
On a log scale chart it becomes even more evident how closely ETH and BTC price develop and that ETH is in fact not a hedge. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:35:16

@_date: 2017-10-06 06:21:12
Thanks for your comment. I think at this point you have a weak case if you want to convince people that bigger blocks are better. Everyone knows that on-chain transactions dont scale and second layer is where its at. Have a nice day.

Bitcoin is just Rogers sidekick now, he couldnt care less about it. Dont ask me why.
Btw. this is fine. When theres an incentive to create bigger blocks he will. Or he will lose to the competing mining pools.
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:42:15
Really good to hear that. Now that i have you, does bech32 cost less in terms of bytes than the segwit wrapped in P2SH? Reason i ask is i heard that the P2SH wrapper adds a few extra bytes to each transaction. Please correct me if im wrong. Ps. Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:46:54
I dont share the sentiment. Wether or not blockstream wants to sell sidechain tech doesent change the fact that bigger blocks are not safe. Right? So its not like Bitcoin is on the wrong track.
And who knows, maybe there wont be a big market for this sidechain tech, maybe someone else will run with the scaling money. Who knows.

The only one petty here is you. You clearly dont know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:18:34
In case you are serious and genuinely want to know the problem with bigger blocks is they dont solve anything. The way bitcoin works is that everyone validates each others transactions, and every new participant has to validate every transaction that ever took place. Thats how it gains its trustlessness and censorship resistance. Thats how it is able to hold value. So when you increase blocksize you increase the burden on everyone. And yet that increased blocksize dont solve anything, maybe a temporary reduction in fees. This is why second layers are needed sooner rather than later because they can provide permanetly cheap fees. Bitcoin cant rely on on-chain transaction exclusively for the next 9 years, not if it wants to go mainstream. Bye. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:49:34
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:42:16
Allright so if we are fine with chain splits every now and then, and everyone accepts 6+ confirmations to be safe. Well, the network gets a litte worse in terms of usability, i mean having to wait for 6 confirmations or more can be tedious. Waiting for 1 is already inconvenient. 
Anyway, thats probably fine. So what kind of attacks will this type of network be able to encounter? And what about the incentive to keep blockspace limited and encourage frugal use?
It seems to me at least that having the limit up in the air means it will expand perpetually, even tho thats bad for the protocol. So not something you would want to hold your money in i would argue. I mean if you dont believe in its long term viability what is the point? You just hope someone buy in higher than you? Thats not right. Thats just a pump and dump.

Ive tried to trade stocks. But they are centralized and companies can go bankrupt, so you are vulnerable to CEO's keeping information hidden and releasing it and your stock dumps and may never recover and you had no time to act. This is not so with bitcoin. Its safe to hodl, because bad news it recovers from. There is no CEO to hide information from you etc. It cant go bankrupt and so on. And it trades 24/7. So you will never have a "monday open" where everyone gets rekt. Its dynamic. bla bla bla

It wasnt a handwave. Do you agree that a blockchain can fail if it becomes too large?
People take bitcoins success for granted. And they call it the honey badger. But its not imune to death. If blocks become too large it will become a signficant headache or rather cancer with no immidate cure. Yes you heard me. Large blocks are literally cancer.
The other thing is that people wish to test segwit on another coin, and then just let bitcoin have the largest blocks. But how about testing large fucking blocks on another coin first? Etereum is leading the way here btw. Just watch that thing crash and burn because they dont give a fuck about optimisation or chain size :)

@_date: 2017-05-22 08:10:22
Yes, the proposal is 80% hashpower activation. There is no guarantee it will get 80% hashpower. Its just a stalling tactic i suspect.
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:11:39
Look. I see your point.
But bitcoin works because the incentives means that it is in particularly miners interest to "be nice". Do you know what i mean? Bitcoin is actually secure because miners are nice. But miners are only nice because the incentive is to be nice. Im not sure if that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:02:36
Also, the lower the number of copies, the higher the burden on the remaining ones hosting. But people say that is not a concern. 
In any case, SegWit is a blocksize increase no matter how you look at it. Max block size is 4mb, but because transactions are measured by weight (Which is the correct way to do it. Its not done just to fit more transactions. Its an actual scaling improvement. Measuring tx by bytes is ineffecient.) effective blocksize's will range between 1.9-3mb as luke-jr demonstrated.

@_date: 2017-05-16 21:55:10
Yea that does not seem sustainable. I wonder what would blocksize have to be in order to keep fees around at most $1 until we reach $5,000.
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:23:30
odd thing is that segwit protects the fee pressure to an extent. it just enables miners to include segwit transactions as well. on top of that i think the market would rejoice over some scaling for bitcoin. anyway i think that goes without saying.

thats excactly what this is tho. we already have segwit, its ready to activate. the hashrate can just signal. we have bip148 as well, buisnesses can just run it and segwit activates. but they have to do this wierd thing where they make their own proposal and put their signature on it. the code isnt even ready yet. its a joke!
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:53:04


The way this agreement is apparantly set up, you have to wait about a year anyway. The software needs to be developed, it needs to be reviewed, it needs to be distributed. On top of that the current segwit activation signalling period would have to expire. But who is going to run this version that these guys made? Who is going to run it? Its kind of like taking a leap of faith, you know what i mean?
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:30:40
Are you serious? Jihan is doing everything he can to split the community so there wont be consensu for a blocksize increase.
1. He signals Emergent Consensus - But it has no activation mechanism. Its literately vaporware
2. He is against a flag day hardfork to 8mb blocks in October
3. He supports Extension blocks which is completely different still
4. He refuses to support SegWit which is the most popular blocksize increase
So based on his actions he is doing everything he can to keep the status quo.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:21:06

@_date: 2017-05-20 12:07:59
(Can i ask how bip148 will work?) is it enough for miners to signal, or do they have to be 100% segwit ready and enforcing in order to pass bip148?
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:12:56


did they claim this? or does the proposal only activate at 80% signalling? it also only activates for the people running said code. which has yet to be formally released and reviewed afaik.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:25:20
You aint seen nothing yet.
Market is trying to figure out what the price for an on-chain transaction should be. And at the sime time its trying to figure out what the bitcoins themselves should be. Let me tell you something, bitcoin price has gone up 100x. Why wouldnt fees do the same?

I knew this proposal was made to look better than it is. It seemed like they had all sat down and carefully mulled over things and after hours of debate came forward with this.

This is incorrect. If you hardfork you would have to determine the max block size. If its 4mb then its 4mb. Segwit doesent change anything?
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:23:24
How am i wrong? Link any tweet that contradicts my statements.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:01:30
As much as i want SegWit i dont think its wise to set up a deadline of 12 months for a hardfork to 2mb (SegWit is 2-3mb blocks anyway). But this deadline for a hardfork isnt going to work with bitcoin since its a decentralized system, people change opinions, new things are discovered/learn etc. I would commit to hardforking whenever a good proposal is ready and when it can safely activate.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:40:51

@_date: 2017-05-23 10:59:20
well the miners make the blocks. no miners, no blocks. so some degree of miner support is needed. but in regards to preventing a hardfork, im not sure why thats attractive? it seems as if the only reason there will be a hardfork or rather a split, is because people chose to remain with the old chain. and for that they probably have their reasons, so why bother them? they can do their own thing if they want. thats just how i view it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:54:00
....if it activates. the way its set up it wont be able to activate for a while. so.. more stalling compared to activating segwit as its currently proposed.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:28:10
It seems like there is a deadlock just to have a deadlock. But i think we are closer to the truth here. Jihan wants precedence that establishes him as an authority, and if SegWit has 51% activation threshold that would put him in such a position, because he likely has influence over about approx. 51% of the hashrate, if not more. 
Do you understand what im saying?
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:48:37


This is debatable. Since its a softfork blocksize increase it has alot of merit. Keep in mind a hardfork has not been done before. People tried a simple hardfork to 2mb and it was meet with extreme contention afaik. The point being that there's more to upgrading a decentralized crypto-currency than the code itself. You cannot hardfork at a whim, well you can, but you risk creating an alt-coin. And im not sure that is what people intend. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:25:37

Hey Luke sorry to bother you. But this BIP148 and you coming out in support could not have come at a better time. You beat those suckers!

if miners want larger blocks and lower fees they are doing a terrible job. segwit would go a long way in accomplishing this and its been available for 6 months now but they arent signalling so it cant be activated yet.

@_date: 2017-05-17 03:35:29
He is obviously against raising the blocksize limit otherwise he would be signalling segwit. I mean we have been stuck with the 1mb limit since November last year because miners refuse to signal. The irony is that these fucks claim at the same time we need a blocksize increase, but their actions are ensuring it stays in place.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:52:32

To be honest the other alt-coins are cheating in one way or the other. For some reason, bitcoin is the perfect balance of scale,  privacy and fungibility. However, bitcoin can be made even greater with for example SegWit and Shnorr.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:37:31
Ye, makes sense. But it seems nitpicky. Segwit shouldnt be disqualified based on that. It seems like you are grasping at straws.

@_date: 2017-05-15 14:41:23
Why are people still talking about it? Bitcoiners are being played like a fiddle
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:28:23
I dont think there is much to gain from such a blocksize increase. Its basically a bailout of people who have built their buisness model and habits on cheap fees. The thing is that a blocksize bailout is just going to last so long until blocks are full again. We literally need a way to scale, and actual economists would argue that these solutions to come up unless we have the high free pressure. Remember that neccecity is the mother of invention. 
So the smart thing to do is to be conservative with blocksize limit increases, for two reasons, 1. Too large blocks increases the costs associated with running a node, which hurts the integrity of the sytem 2. second layer tech etc. is needed regardless, conservative blocksize increases help advance them.
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:37:14


yes they can you dummy. someone will always be mining. besides, the other day we saw block rewards with 5 btc fees. with 1mb blocks... segwit doubles blocksize, so around 10btc in fees is possible...? should be enough to secure the network. besides there is no gurantee segwit will be the only blocksize increase the next 10 years..
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:30:12
Yea that makes sense. But there is no miner in bitcoin today that would do such a thing. It didnt even happen on Ethereum even tho it was significantly cheaper to do and the Ethereum Classic was way more hated at the time of the split. Nobody is going to hate segwit. Everyone says its needed, i actually dont see what the problem is. And it sucks we have to do a UASF now, but it has to be done.

See. its not that hard.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:48:51
Because bitcoin has failed. Its fundamentally flawed?
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:50:40


I dont believe that is correct. There can still be transactions off-chain. And transactions could also move to alternative cryptocurrencies if bitcoin doesent have LN:


They really wont. LN will enable transactions or usecases that is currently being priced out. So it doesent move transactions off-chain, per say. Blocks will still be full.


It depends on what you consider scale. If you think off-chain solutions and second layer tech can increase scale then it does so. But if you only consider scale larger blocks then it obviously dont. I dont think larger blocks = scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:20:16
Then they will mine on the old chain. But it will be interesting to see how much value it will have :)
I think its important to note that the BIP148 chain will pose a significant threat to the old chain if one were to exist. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:04:10
When i say BIP148 im talking about the movement. Perhaps i should have been clearer. But they can change PoW if not enough sha256 hashrate is joining them. And i think it wil be a win/win for them. Because the new miners that join *will* be signalling segwit so segwit *will* activate and that way the UASF is a succes. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:21:13


Can you explain why the first pools that supported BU were pools that came out of nowhere ? Do you think im stupid or something?
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:47:34
you should have started this two years ago. theres a chance price will dip below $1,500 in the not too distant future since its starting to look like a bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:32:22
Thats true. But these guys are trying to re-invent the wheel. We already have BIP148 to activate segwit with less than 95% hashrate.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:01:27
It is also in Bitfurys interest to mine BIP148 because it fixes Covert asicboost at least. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:40:05
It is also not dissimilar to a good mobster movie where they help out a buisness, and then the buisness is in debt to the mob. The mob then abuses the buisness and finally abandons it bankrupt. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:32:57
How so?
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:02:19
Wow you are not biased at all
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:41:29
I think they just try to do what they can to move bitcoin forward
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:37:43
bip148 is better than anything out there right now.
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:32:07
Its not risky. It just takes effort.

Thats very interesting. I believe that there can be evil outside of religion. Like, wether or not someone is evil can be objectively measured. An extreme example is rape. A rapist is evil. Anyway this is a crazy discussion, and i dont know where im going with it. Sorry. Bye.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:42:32
To be fair so has the price of bitcoin. I mean it started at 0. Basically its up infinity. But thats besides the point i was trying to make.
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:24:49
The UASF will beat these peoples proposal since it happens in august. So eventually miners will just switch to the UASF. They should have just signalled segwit from the beginning.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:38:20
Most likely because other coins have SegWit now. And because SegWit is very popular. Like someone else mentioned the cost of not having SegWit is high.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:47:38
We dont have to solve it all in one go. 2mb blocks are safe, so activate segwit so we can get them already. Its been 6 months of bickering and stalling, just activate segwit already.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:40:12
I think its safe to say that luke-jr is the citation here. What more do you want?
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:04:23
Its a flag day activation of SegWit. What is SegWit? Basically a blocksize increase. What is a blocksize increase? Well bitcoin works by making blocks every 10 minutes but the  distributed nodes only accept blocks that are max 1mb large. However, there is seemingly demand for blocks larger than that. So SegWit tries to increase blocksize, but it also tries to incentivise more effecient use of blockspace etc. It also tries to fix malleability. What is malleability? Well basically when you publish a transaction everyone gets the details to republish it if they wish, afaik. So if you are not aware of this, it could end up costing you money, it also reduces the viability of payment channels afaik. SegWit also introduces script versioning which basically makes updating of bitcoins scripting language relatively easier. What is bitcoin scripting language? That i dont know tbh. maybe someone else can help.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:05:01
you moron. bitcoin is about to top out and have a flash crash. THATS when you mortgage your house and buy like hell. Not now!
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:53:52
Yes. It sucks it have to be that way(literally orphaning non signalling blocks) but what other options are there?
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:11:34
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:13:47
I dont think development will be more decentralized just by having alternative client programs. It depends how good the alternative clients are. For example, forking Bitcoin Core and changing a few things... its not excactly decentralizing development?
I would like to know what you mean when you say the next checkmate is the big block? It sounds interesting but im not sure what you mean. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:18:38
Bitmain also has connections with bitpay and things like that. Remember how stephen pair wrote an article how he is not concerned about the blocksize limit? few weeks later he announce million dollar partnership with bitmain working on "open source mining software" (how vague can you be?) and lo and behold all of a sudden stephens pair rhetoric change and now plays the tune of bitmain..
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:22:13
Doesent sound too bad tbh.
If SegWit fails to activate, maybe core will make a new proposal that includes segwit and maybe 4-8mb max blocksize. It will be interesting to see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:44:20
Thats interesting. I think this is the first thing large companies do before betting big on things. (They do not want to become victims of patent trolls) This is just a theory tho :P I dont really know.

LN is not in competition with on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:11:05
Unless there is a hardfork i dont see fees going lower any time soon. SegWit will make them lightly slower but if adoption keeps up they are just going to return to where they are now. 
I think what needs to happen is that a second layer that is much more scalable should be invented. Then we can have bitcoin transactions that are cheap. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:47:40

Wtf rofl
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:02:20
We have a problem right now tho, i think that the velocity of bitcoin money is slowing down significantly because of the blocksize limit. and there does not seem to be an alternative way to transact bitcoin. of course this could all change, but this current bubble, when it tops may be the end of an area. bitcoin slowly fades into irrelevance after that.

@_date: 2017-05-23 09:44:56
it doesent activate based on mining support, it just activates in august. If there is not alot of miners, we will take it from there. But imo the incentives are to mine BIP148 more so than not. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:48:29
bitsko do you think there are evil people in the world?
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:54:59
full blocks is the natural state of crypto. even if we did everything we could, ie. kept increasing blocksize youd either end up with full blocks or a failing blockchain, because it got too big and nobody wants to run it.
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:08:37
i dont understand why rbtc dont agree bitmain is cancer. rbtc hit blockstream so hard for being a large company, but bitmain is probably 20x larger and they  have maybe control of 50% of hashrate and  not a peep from rbtc? strange
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:32:29
Oldest trick in the book.
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:39:44
Why is that likely? Do you not expect the controversy to increase as we get closer to the hardfork? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:06:40
Fyi a hardfork also requires software to update. In fact it requires the software to update in advance otherwise it will be on the old chain which is why hf's take a long time to execute (Everyone has to be ready in advance). With SegWit, alot of software is already ready, but the best part is even the software that isnt ready wont be forked off because its a softfork. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:33:02
I dont think blockstream has ulterior motives, and niether does Core. They just prefer to play it safe.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:47:21
Yes. There is plenty of work to do. Better fee estimation. Better buisness practices. New buisness models. New technology. All of these things are needed to scale bitcoin, and i hope that the seemingly rising demand for on-chain transactions will accelerate the development of these. But i could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:59:07

you pay per byte you consume, so a ddos would be expensive because fees are significant. right now, 1mb of blockspace costs more than $3,000. And thats just 1mb.

2. Present their proposal
3. ???
4. Profit

@_date: 2017-07-12 16:16:02
SegWit2x is pushed by special interests yet you make it seem as if its this big community driven thing.
On a side note, if SegWit2x was really community driven they would have chosen better replay protection. The only reason they choose this kludgy one is so that SPV clients do not have to update. This only illustrates how weak the consensus is for the change if they are concerned SPV clients will not even update to support it. And the thing is, as far as i know, this means SPV clients do not even get replay protection, in which case what is the point?
tl;dr the replay protection is half-assed. And i hope developers of SPV software will speak out, because essentially it puts their users at risk as far as i can tell.

BTC.com, ViaBTC, BTC.TOP and of course Antpool.

I would also like to add that those pools should have been signalling BIP148 and not NYA. They are doing Jihan a favor and giving him the oppertunity to postpone activation further.

@_date: 2017-07-25 11:29:46
The altcoin is actually terrible. You can go on their github and you can see that even the introduction is half-assed and has spelling mistakes. Then you can follow the discission and one of the devs cant even be bothered to change the default port of bitcoin ABC so it doesent share the same as Bitcoin. But this is such a tiny change but the dev is like "this is a good idea, but we are going to release soon so its probably a bad idea to change" But its literally one line of code rofl. They just come across as dimwitted.

@_date: 2017-05-02 18:09:37
What are they even going to make? The announcement is so unspecific. Its hard to say wether this is good or bad.
It sounds like they are going to make a full node? But is it for bitcoin? And then why would they not say so specifically then?
All we know is that over the next few years Bitmain is going to pay Bitpay a couple million dollars.
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:37:23


@_date: 2017-05-16 21:03:56
Im not familiar with Circle. But they made a huge mistake pivoting away from BTC. They should have made a wallet that enables cheap off-chain bitcoin transactions. :)
Remember that Elon Musk became a millionarie making Paypal. It is beyond me why no-body is making something similar for bitcoin. I mean, with bitcoin something like that gets even easier because you dont have to deal with banks.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:28:53
Yes. Some people believe bitcoin is more decentralized because the creator is not around anymore. Do you think anyone will pick uo ETH development if Vitalik leaves?

Bitcoiners are the wierdest fucking people. What am i doing here.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:38:09
Imo the alts will suffer more from BCH than than Bitcoin will. Why? because the alts hold the capital from speculators that are betting on anything but bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:24:34
Its good for people who use bitcoin as a retail system and want cheap fees and dont care about the long term, but its not good for people who wish to hodl bitcoin and keep it decentralized. Imo the people who are seeking cheap fees should build these cheap fee layers on top so that bitcoin can remain decentralized and trustless and have alot of value.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:22:03


Thats basically a 51% attack? Or rather just alot of hashrate leaving for another chain in the eyes of those who run Bitcoin Core which is most people. There are solutions to hashrate rapidly dropping tho but it will be problematic either way. Markets will be in turmoil but also there will be a dispute over which coin should be called bitcoin. So i hope the miners stop fucking around like that because it really serves no good purpose.
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:52:11
wasnt the reason segwit was contentious because of asicboost? not sure the next softfork will be as contentious?
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:19:15
Thats some bullshit.
First of all, if other coins have greater capacity why arent they used more? 
Second of all SegWit significantly increases capacity. I say significantly because no other crypto handle the traffic bitcoin does. Enabling SegWit this traffic potentially doubles. Nothing comes close to that amount of traffic.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:29:19

@_date: 2017-05-17 05:38:03

@_date: 2017-07-12 01:31:22
Even the "small blockers" are advocating for a blocksize increase, but the big blockers are blocking it because its not big enough according to them. Silly politics.
Meanwhile network use has dropped, which is a big slap in the face to the big blockers. The sense of urgency is gone.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:27:38
Erik what do you think the goal of Bitcoin Cash is? Its obviously an attack and you can tell by how half-assed it is. Its not about the software, or the people running the nodes. Its about being a nuisance to bitcoin plain and simple.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:03:49
The timelines has a pretty big coincidence. Luke-Jr  starts supporting BIP148 and thats when it really picks up traction. Some time after suddenly all miners are willing to signal SegWit albeat with the caveat that they will also do a hardfork.. Lame
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:59:07


Thats why its a bad idea to do big blocksize increases because you dont know what technology people will develop. Someone may develop a technology or off-chain service that significantly reduces on-chain transactions and then what? Lower blocksize again to create fees for miners? Such things reek of economic central planning and its not neccecary. Its based on fear that detractors have been spreading, namely with on-chain fees comes a crumbling bitcoin, but those are lies.
On a side note hardware has stopped improving exponentially. Not sure about internet connections but i think we are close to the top as well. In 5 years time things have likely not improved much, the leaps and bounds are behind us it would seem. Nevertheless do you really want to gamble its not? Seems wrong. Probably why you are not in charge of anything IRL. No offence.

This is not true. If SegWit activates and you dont update your software, it will just be buisness as usual for you. Nothing changes tbh.
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:59:46
The following is a comment of mine copy pasted from somewhere else. But i think its relevant here as well.
Bitcoin does not exist to serve bitpay. If their buisness model relies on taking blockspace every block, and significant amounts of it, they are doomed and they know that(Also why should bitpay have all the blockspace?). But what is their solution? Well they just increase blockspace available. This puts a higher strain on the network tho, and eventually all that blockspace will be full anyway, in which case bitpay is bankrupt anyway.
Ergo **BItpay must change**, more so than bitcoin. But they have been unwilling to do so even tho the writing has been on the wall for a long time. 
 not build a business that relies on significant and ever increasing amounts of blockspace. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:54:03
Noob question, but kraken advertises replay protection for BCH afaik, how do they accomplish this if BCH does not "natively" support it?
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:38:03


You are wrong. a block would only need a few segwit transactions to surpass the 1mb limit the network is currently under. So probably right off the bat blocks are going to be larger. And they will continue to grow as as more people upgrade.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:43:28

It seems folly considering segwit already increases blocksize. SegWit could also have been activated 7-8 months ago but i didnt see any sense of urgency from the segwit2x peeps? Best just to ignore their games and carry on improving bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:28:51


By this logic you also blocked scaling because you didnt provide a solution that reached consensus. But to be honest the solution Core provided does have consensus, the miners are just slow to signal imo.

Why did they rise like CRAZY to begin with. Most likely explanation is someone pumping fees. Another explanation could be someone mixing a large sum of coins. For example the bitfinex heist or something. These people typically dont care about the fees and will pay whatever if they sit on 180,000 stolen BTC or however much it was. But the consensus seem to be that it was spam, politically motivated to cause a sense of urgency to get as many people on board with the SegWit2x agreement as possible. Meh.

No, why would it? 


Not necceseraily. For example if the no. of on-chain transactions was reduced, for example by some miners mining empty blocks or only inculding redicolously high fee paying transactions, the no. of on-chain transactions go down but fees arguably go up.

The guy in the front left is missing some key details imo. SegWit2x does not mean there is a gatekeeper now. And i think we will know when Core release the next softfork. My prediction is it will just be signalled like previous softforks without any drama.

If bitcoin continues to be a respected store of value the market will deliver cheap transactions. Most people dont need or care about onchain transaction anyway i would argue. And those who do will not care about fees. As long as i can get my bitcoin from a to b i dont really care how its done.

This doesent make sense. How would they overwrite the shorter chain? A shorter chain is not neccesrily overwritable afaik.

@_date: 2017-07-13 10:31:32
The hype is wrong then. Blockchain has no potential to make fees cheap. Even 32mb blocks will lead to a fee market - although it may not, because bitcoin loses its decentralization and thus demand. But 32mb blocks will still not be enough. The cheaper the fees are the more blockspace people will consume. Other blockchains or sidechains should take on the burden of big blocks let bitcoin be the trustless store of value..

Bitcoin could probably increase blocksize and clear the backlog faster, but that doesent mean it scales better. Imo you should look at orphans/uncles. The higher they are the worse the coin scales imo.
I also find it so ironic that Vitalik is supposedly against PoW claiming it wastes power. But Ethereum is the king of orphans which is literally wasting power since no transactions get processed in an orphan.

148 is the answer.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:28:45
segwit2x is not developed in an open source fashion. In fact its not even ready or released yet. So it is difficult to support. Also i dont see the rationale for the 2x. If you can explain why id be happy to listen.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:29:52
Theres a nasty caveat here. And thats that SegWit2x includes a contentious hardfork as well. Not something that will cause price to moon. But after we know wether hardfork will happen or not, price could start moonin again..
@_date: 2017-06-24 00:52:20
It wouldnt be an alt-coin. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:24:33
To expand on that::
In order for SegWit to activate 95% of all blocks must be ready for it. So by boycutting the blocks that do not signal segwit, 95% is easily reached. 
To expand further: The New York agreement does the same, but only if 80% signal readyness first. But on top of that The New York agreement also includes code that hardforks bitcoin.
This means we basically went from standing completely still on the scaling front, to going 130MPH. I think it is reckless.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:01:02
basically they are gonna orphan aĺl blocks that dont signal segwit. so they kind of doing core nodes a favor. but the issue is that if they also start orphaning blocks that dont signal their hardfork. and gonna be a big issue if they do it without consensus. basically gonna be the end of bitcoin as we know it? not gonna be very sound
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:01:06
I think they rent out their hashrate or something
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:00:01
Price is down alot since i posted this
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:23:16
obviously the new york agreement will not succeed in changing the consensus rules, but it could suceed in keeping the status quo which is in some miners short term interest.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:36:39
Bitcoin *is* competing with fiat. This is why blocksize limit among other things must be kept in check. Because eventually the powers that be will strike back, and if our nodes are in data centers, bitcoin will be an easy target.
Only way it stands a chance against the powers that be is via guerilla warfare. And that is nodes you can pop up in every home without being easily detected due to bandwidth consumption etc. if need be.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:53:19
I mean have you even bothered to look up Bip148's support? It may not be easy to do. But from looking around i know that alot of people support it. The loud voices is just the tip of the iceberg.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:32:03
It still doesent have consensus, you would know if you paid attention instead of listening to Jgarzik all day.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:08:27
They only support SegWit2x because they know it wont reach 80% signalling. BIP 148 is the only way.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:54:39
To be honest i think the miners will try and coerce the network into also accepting the hardfork. This is what "smart money" is pricing in right now. Why i believe the coin will go down in value over the next few months.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:19:24

Because of the asicboost patent there will never be a competitor to bitmain.. We can keep dreaming but when AMD looks into SHA256 asics and the competition, and they realise there is a patent with a 20% optimisation advantage, they will not enter that market. Please correct me if im wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:06:31
Miners will keep stalling even if they say they prefer to scale asap. UASF is the only way to scale.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:45:53
So here is a closer look at the segwit timeline. 
there is definitely a correlation, and you can see bitcoin dominance start to fall before ETF is denied, when segwit signalling start to stall.
But honestly we dont need these charts to understand that blocking segwit is f'ed up?
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:07:09

It seems to me that NOT signalling SegWit is the contentious behavior but miners have started to come around because they realise this.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:59:39
I am kinda sad that bitcoin cannot be mined with GPUs. It hurts the coin distribution. One of the reasons Ethereum is so popular is because regular people can mine it, so they talk about it with their friends and family and they end up buying some, so on so forth.. Really sad bitcoin has asics.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:45:49
Yes, its tempting to support it. But thats why i consider it a poison pill.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:13:02
SegWit2x *is* LOL. It will never activate because it requires 80% miner signalling. BIP148 actually works with less than 20% and is much better.

@_date: 2017-06-22 12:48:18
Not only that but stability is also a factor. The New York agreement will potentially be a big disruption of the network, and for what purpose? Its not like they are fixing anything.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:31:01
By any reasonable standard bip148 is huge. It is one of the most supported scaling bips in existence. Id like to see you mention one that has more support.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:49:55
If this was some clever way to raise fees, i commend them.
First you raise them redicolously. Take the outrage, then lower them and people feel relieved, but they are still 100% higher than originally :D
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:14:47
If bip148 gains traction, the backup plan should be to play along.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:41:15
I think i know what your problem is. You measure support by who is screaming the loudest. So even if BIP148 is only supported by a few loud voices, support is much more widespread than you think. Do you know what i mean?
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:34:57
It is the big blockers that seem to be in a rush because according to them if bitcoin doesent get bigger blocks nao the sky will fall. I think SegWit and the blocksize increase it comes with will be good for bitcoin, but maybe not essential, so there is no rush. However an activation that is as clean as possible seems essential. How does SegWit2x accomplish this? What does it do different that makes miners so anxious to signal all of a sudden and what was wrong with the original rollout?
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:09:56


SegWit2x is not excactly a well co-ordinated hardfork tho. Its very much yolo.


Its not really a compromise tho. And i still dont understand whats in it for the 2x side. It doesent make much of a difference in the end.


IF the hardfork goes well, and IF people will still like and use bitcoin after :)


Imo hardforking just to hardfork is a silly idea. Its better to wait until there is a proper reason to do it, and then do it properly. But thats just me. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:01:25
Why do you ask?
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:11:02
Softforks do not permanently split. In fact there is little risk they split at all. And IF they do, the split can be remedied.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:05:12
at the time it wasnt known bitmain had asicboost in their chips. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:48:15
bip148 is huge. supported by devs, supported by buisnesses, supported by miners AND supported by end users. but the problem is who takes the first step and get the ball rolling? 
anyway, a miner does not use bitcoin like an exchange or end user will, and softforks will always be compatible with buisnesses and end user nodes. however miners can split the chain by contiuning to mine old blocks afaik. please correct me if im wrong. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:57:14
Where did you get that from? 6 months ago SegWit was released. If it was active fees wouldnt be near as high as they have been lately. So saying blockstream did nothing makes no sense. They are also a big sponsor of bitcoin Core. They probably support protocol development more than most :)
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:56:16
If they do they are damn stupid. SegWit could already be activated safely, but instead they back brand new and untested software that is even bundled with a hardfork. How stupid can they be?
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:07:16
Even if there is no malicious intent the incentive is kind of to include all the transaction you can when you find a block. So whats going to happen is it will be a race to the bottom. Because you could be the miner that only makes a 2mb block because you wnt to preserve the fee pressure, but then the next miner is just going to include all the transactions because the fee pressure have now built up a bit. Bitcoin really is no good without full blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-24 00:46:05


Stop spreading this kind of misinfo. First of all "Core" never agreed to do anything. So how can "Core" claim SegWit fulfills the agreement?
I mean you are the one busy playing word games while Core is actually working on improving stuff.

It will be interesting to see how things pan out. Maybe i am under estimating bitcoin decentralization and resilliance to the coming hardfork attempt.

i hope they all proceed with the hardfork as well so they fork themselves off and learn a valuable lesson because i think this agreement is silly tbh. when you can aldeady signal for segwit.

The market is not being fooled by the miners and its pricing in that the NYA wont succeed. What people need to understand is that miners cannot be trusted, thats the sad reality. So if they give the impression that they will support NYA and wants bitcoin to scale and moon asap, chances are they dont mean it. Its sad, but thats how it is. Cant trust em.

I will have coins on both. May the best chain win. Im rooting for Core.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:32:32
That doesent really make sense. Only reason bip148 would be reckless is if someone delibarately will mine the old chain - But then BIP148 is not reckless, it is the miner that continue to mine the old chian that is... Anyway im out. Catch you later.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:54:20
The problem is the dishonesty and the games. Why hold everyone back?
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:17:05
There is no crossroads :) it will stay at 1mb. I mean that seems like the most likely outcome. And i think things wont change until its too late. Miners just dont give a fuck.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:11:09
in the case of covertly supporting a chain split, i believe you are referring to bip148. pretty much all core devs are openly against it. and those who are for it, are openly for it. there is nothing covertly going on.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:57:13
Hello Mr. Voorhees, i didnt see it was you at first. But i dont believe having 10 million users should give you any leverage. Because at that point we are talking about special interests. If special interests can affect the bottom layer how have bitcoin solved anything?
I also question the motives of these companies with 10 million users. I suspect that they only support segwit2x because they hope it will make people stop sending them support tickets regarding fees, thats all they hope to accomplish with it. So thats really where we are. SegWit2x is not about a revolution and new and sound money, its just about making people stop sending support tickets.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:18:16
You are moving the goalposts. The question was wether or not BIP148 has more than 5% support. The question was **not** wether or not it had overwhelming support. Id say that SegWit2x and BIP148 have about the same level of support.

@_date: 2017-06-20 10:50:40
I should probably elaborate on why i think miners will support a poison pill. It should be somewhat obvious why disgruntled devs and alt-coiners would support such a thing.
What it boils down to is that miners simply dont know any better and they seem more susceptible to being influenced to do the wrong things. I mean miners could be anxious to fork because they want to work and they want to do things. Its the human condition. So when all they do all day is add more hashpower, and watch them hash, that doesent cut it for them. They want more. And thats where forks come in. This makes miners vulnerable to fork politics which is unfortunate. Because i think there has to be a fork that seriously injures the network until miners will have learned their lesson and back off. 
Sidechains could be the solution to this problem because that gives miners the potential playgrounds they desire. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:06:42
Yea in that case go ahead. I sell coins every now and then and top up my bank account when its running low. I use that as my "hotwallet".

Kraken can be very slow. Just fyi. Today was no fun. But i think its one of the most secure if not most secure exchanges out there.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:34:27
this is the nature of decentralized crypto. once the genesis block is launched the design is pretty much set in stone. bitcoin has smart devs that figure out how to scale and fix bugs in the protocol despite this :)
i am also curious which coins you consider designed correctly atm?
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:23:16
Dont the cost go up the bigger the blocks are? Or does the potential profit also go up?
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:04:17
Does it matter? Just hodl :)

Imo your attitude resembles whining much more than mine. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:39:44
Wtf lol. Bitcoin has a finite supply, only 21m coins. Very powerfull. ETH has a marketing machine, but without a finite supply it will lose in the end.

SegWit now is easier said than done. First of all their deployment og SegWit is not compstible with the current one, so gotta wait. But also it relies in miner signalling, this time 80% i believe. But miner signalling dont Work, certainly will just be more delays. UASF is the only way to get SegWit and scaling this year i would argue.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:25:47
No no no. Miners are the guardians of the protocol. They know whats best. /s :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:39:54
Question is if they will be doing a 51% attack or not. Probably they will.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:42:57
300 satb seems to be the norm again for a fast transaction. Just saying. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:17:12
We are at a crossroads right now where the code is not desirable for some economic nodes and possibly some miners. It will be interesting to see wether the original code will hold up to this scrutiny (So far it has). But the special interests have not backed down yet.
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:31:11
Are you serious? SegWit2x has not had the proper review its not even ready yet. Only a mad man would propose it, and then acuse people who dont support it of stalling scaling. Meanwhile SegWit is ready. Just go ahead and activate it?
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:14:12
Miners are not the sharpest tools in the shed and it makes sense too. Compare the qualifications needed to be a miner with the qualifications needed to develop software like Bitcoin Core :) One requires relatively low IQ the other requires relatively high IQ i would argue.
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:24:20
its ok they will get zk-snarks soon. wonder how much gas you are going to end up using by having yourname.eth + zk-snarks wonder if it will be worth it in the end. fancy stuff tho.

Why do you support 2x?

@_date: 2017-06-19 12:17:53
Imo if the 2x is because of politics i still dont understand whats in it for the 2x side. Its not like it makes much of a difference in the end?

Perhaps not in the long run. But in the short run people should notice a difference afaiu.

The big blocker vision is wrong. Its based on the idea that blocksize limit will kill bitcoin but there is no evidence to suggest this is the case.

Not sure why SegWit is contentious. Care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:53:14
down because we are actually looking at hardfork in the short term. a random hardfork with 0 technical merit as far as i can tell even. you could go as far as to call it a 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:11:27
that proposal will be over and forgotten by then
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:55:12

Those companies are already on my good list. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:27:10
you have to be kidding me. that thing was made by a amateurs.
1. confusion among signees what the agreement actually means
2. delibarate or not, the proposed design is incompatible with the current network
3. custom software. questionable if anyone will run it, not even written yet, and going to take time for people to switch.
4. relies on miner signalling which has proven to not work. bu is a example, classic is a example but also segwit is a example.
a real adult would see this

@_date: 2017-06-19 16:13:17
Semantics my ass. What excactly dont people like about SegWit? There is little respectable criticism. The people who disagree on it are only trying to cripple bitcoin, hence they are acting contentiously.
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:45:30


What do you mean by this? How is it progressing? All we got is someone saying they will adopt it. Do you know how many times that has happened before, and then they never did. BU, XT, Classic. How is this different?


They did deliver segwit which looks like is going to activate.

These guys knows whats up and isnt playing any of the miners games.
 Now
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:25:49
the developer community aka bitcoin core released a fork in 2016 called segwit. it was supposed to activated by miners, but so far not enough are signalling. forks are risky so you need most of the hashrate to be safe. but since most of the hashrate is not signalling, bitcoin is stuck on 1mb blocks which is way less than current demand so fees are skyrocketing. so just you know, developers released a fix last year, but it aint active yet because miners refuse to upgrade and signal.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:24:47
Ok good luck with that. I wish you all the best.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:26:32
I beg to differ. Theres alot of talking but no-one is interested in a split. So at the end of the day there wont be one. I am also confident that if bitcoin for whatever reason tanks, so will all of crypto.

How does hashpower play a role when it comes to doing a safe hardfork? I mean if a hardfork had 80% or more miners doing it, it doesent speak much to the safety of it. The code could be bad, the game theory behind it could be bad, there could be full nodes and essential software not ready to hardfork.. All this kind of stuff :) Please correct me if im wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:11:42
