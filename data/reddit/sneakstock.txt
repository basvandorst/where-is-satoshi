Sometimes they all go up together, and sometimes they don’t. Last few days Litecoin and bitcoin have kind of been opposites, because I think a lot of people are panicing and taking out litecoin and putting it into bitcoin (that was happening when btc was 18-19k), now its vice versa

Dont look at coinbase, tell your wife to hide the app on your phone, or just block the website on your computer. Plenty of ways bro
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:14:33
So what does this exactly mean?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:28
You sure it’s USD? Also maybe they just can’t keep up
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:55
Why exactly though? How can somebody be so uncertain about it dropping down so much or rising so high?

Keeps asking “how much they making”, well.. if they invested a month ago... or even 2 weeks ago... they making at least 30% return.
But overall good video for the noobs

Theres a lot of daily stupid posts on this sub, this one might top it, and theres so many upvotes. Cringey kids in here

Excellent strategy, let us know how that goes in a few months shadowbandit
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:36:07
No, they dont. Also electric cars are always improving, so technology is always improving and getting better, and its hard for electric cars to distinguish themseves besides with having better mile ranges, so no

Realistic impression of bitcoin hodlers
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:34:42
Haha! Spent $100 at $8250 today! Hopefully I make some money!
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:07:58
Considering its up 18% today yeah I think with that rate it might...
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:07:06
Hodling until you die seems realistic for a lot of hodlers

Porsche and lamborghini are holding their value the best right now. All Ferraris besides a 488 and newer are. Mclaren keeps releasing better and faster cars every single year and destroying their brand by being great. Everything else isnt
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:03:31
Dont, in all seriousness thats probably one of the worst car brands. They hold their value probably the worst BY FAR from any “luxury” car brand right now, and they have maintenance out the ass so unless bumper to bumper warranty and already depreciated, they are terrible. Theres a firm group of believers who think Maserati wont be along in the next few years.

This makes me happy that it’s 10k and that other people have low coinbase account sums like me :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:43:52
Hey! Just bought $100 worth of BTC today off coinbase :) I was wondering why it takes so long to get into my account, it said 8 days? Is there anyway to do more instant trading?
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:15:00
It’ll be hard to not be tempted to sell it at 20, but I want it to be 35 so I can buy a car
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:58:14
This is a dumb ass post lmao
Thats like me bragging to a guy who makes a $10 million a year that I made a few grand off bitcoin and somehow he’s upset
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:22:23
Do it and hodl brother, put in another $200
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:38:50
No I watched the movie... which goes as far as your knowledge on the matter does too. At the end of the day the twins got chump change to what the Zucc has so it really doesnt matter.

Wanted real answers, not sarcasm.

They don’t try to sell you information, they want to sell you an initial click 
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:22:36
Year 2078 bitcoin is now .003 cents a coin, your great-grandson bends over on your death bed and says “please sell grandpa I need money for my school books” As you rise your head slowly and beckon your great-grandson to move closer, so you can whisper in his ear. You whisper with your last breath “fuck it hodl son”, you pass and your coins are now forever lost because nobody had the code

Broke college student here.
Got like $600 in the bank, put $100 into BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:43:14
Be safe. Buy a roof over your head. Your house is real, bitcoin might not be. Dont speculate and risk your future
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:21:57
Please. Don’t be a dumb ass.

1 bitcoin costing 2.5m in 2020, be a LITTLE realistic lol, btc couldn’t sustain that growth when it peaked at almost 20k, yet you think its going to be 2.5m? Why they call us hodlers dreamers, cause of posts like this lol
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:47:46
Oh really? Its depreciated? Shut up you know nothing about the car re-sale market, these things trade for 3m-3.5, its not your typical bmw that drops 30% of its face value when you drive off the dealership. Educate yourself
You cant just buy these cars you need to have a good relationship with lamborghini and receive the alocations, 20 roadsters 20 coupes.
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:55:06
These cars were sold YEARS AGO, to customers who didnt even see them. These lamborghinis do not depreciate in value. Centenarios trade for 3m.
