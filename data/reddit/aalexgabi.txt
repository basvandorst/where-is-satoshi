My mistake. I wasn't aware of that post!

Tor doesn't make you anonymous. It gives you the opportunity to be anonymous instead. The second you google your name you stop being anonymous.

There are many Bitcoin millionaires who would not bother donating cash for various reasons.

These have been shut down because people running the services have compromised their identities, and therefore they were busted. No Tor hidden service was shut down there, the whole server was shut down because the owner was obliged to do so.

If you use Microsoft Windows as your operating system, there is a 99.99...9% chance that your are not anonymous, even if you use Tor.

Well I find it under-reported!

What do you mean? I don't understand!

Many people ignore this but if a government makes both bitcoin and gold (again?) illegal will it be as relevant for bitcoin as for gold? I guess not. People want drugs they get it. I don't see why illegally trading bitcoin wouldn't be easy!

Bitcoin has the intrinsic value of being an instantly transferable, not confiscable form of value. That in itself has value! When people buy bitcoins they buy them for their advantages, which give them value.

Is there a way to trustlessly prove that you are geographically located somewhere?

You may have better chance in hacking your stolen computer than hacking Bitcoin!

Is there a way to trustlessly limit voting to 1 vote per issue per person?

Even if I sometimes want to use Apple products I can't buy one because of how evil I perceive them. It would be like voting for them to conquer the world sort of speak. The way I see their business is "Hey look at how cool our product is... but you'd have to give up these things... and pay us a shit load of money"

They will loose either if they defend themselves or not so why not make Bitcoin their friend instead of their enemy? It's a plain bad strategy in my opinion.

Why this problem doesn't get enough attention? What are the main reasons?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:16:13
You can still transfer them, right? It's still quasi impossible to have it confiscated if you'd want to, right? Weather these things have a great value or not is another discussion.

I just wanted to reformulate the question in a non deniable way...

What minute?

No. It depends on [tinkerbell effect](

Then the only choice left is to voluntarily join groups and vote on issues within them, no? Such groups may be called Germany, Sweden, McDonald's etc.

How can somebody shut down a Tor hidden service? Can you give an example of a Tor hidden service being shut down?
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:44:25
We are on the same page here! This is why I said "within", implying "within the network".

Can you enumerate some solved and/or unsolved problems? Can you eventually link some places where you had public discussions about it? I am first searching for what has been done/talked about this subject.

I would argue that the intrinsic value of gold is far less than that of some other materials. Diamonds, platinum or even LSD have in my opinion greater intrinsic value than gold. They are rarely used as a form of stored value. The intrinsic value of gold is just a fraction of it's market value. That is to say intrinsic value is not important but just a +

I just agree with one thing the man said! I don't care who he was as a person!

It can be even used by organisations and companies internally if they create their own group within, no?

Does anybody know about such kind of project? I'm a programmer, I have free time (for now), a laptop, a fast Internet connection (very soon), a little brain power and it's an idea that motivates me... so I'm willing to volunteer!

Thank you for sharing this video. Liquid democracy illustrates perfectly what I described.

Do you have any link with Satoshi or the person that called himself/herself Satoshi?
