Any plans for https:// support so we don't have to show the world what we're reading?

The Danish people in question had bought Bitcoin through traditional exchanges utilizing their bank accounts.  Then, once customs intercepted drug packages, the police looked at their bank accounts to see if they'd purchased bitcoins.  Not sure if this type of circumstantial evidence would stand up elsewhere, or even in Denmark, but we will see as the prosecutions play out.  There have been a couple claims in the media where the Danish popo feign that they are hot shit when it comes to blockchain analysis, but if you read [the explanation]( it's pure hot **horseshit**. 
SilkRoad: They did not track the bitcoin, because the operator(s) of SR were smart enough not to involve their real identity with their "illegal" activities.  Funny part is, the 2 government agents (Carl Mark Force IV (DEA) and Sean Bridge (Secret Service)) who have since been sentenced for their crimes while pursuing the silk road case did get tracked by and prosecuted using their bitcoin transactions to their bank accounts under their real identities:
Drug dealers from SR and the subsequent markets have all been busted through traditional LE practices such as fingerprint analysis and working with USPS to find out who made the postage purchases:
This is why there are money transmission and money services businesses regulations, in addition to the Banking Secrecy Act.  You CANNOT move money through the traditional financial system in significant amounts without CYK/AML regulations exposing your identity and inherently violating any privacy you wish you had.  This is one of the biggest reasons that bitcoin and the dream of an open, permissionless, decentralized, p2p currency and payment network that has been 20+ years in the making helps make actual freedom a reality.

In Europe, things are a bit different.  There is no analog legislation so RC sellers do business pretty openly, and there are a lot of them.  These european suppliers buy from china and then resell to the EU market.  Most end users are not ordering RCs directly from China.

But why should Bitcoin *intentionally* plan for not 1 but 2 upcoming hard forks?
We need to fork as little as possible and keep growing capacity.

Hippocrite AND a hero!
Is it possible to subscribe to libertarian ideals (Non aggression princicple) and be so dedicated to it as to be subcribed to Machiavellian principles in bringing a libertarian society about?  Cognitive dissonance alarm bells ringing everywhere - but it seems as though this is what happened.
