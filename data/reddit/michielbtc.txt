Bitcoin is just coming out of a bear market while stocks seem to enter one soon, the next BTC top might coincide with the Stockmarket bottom. Might be a perfect opportunity to HODL bitcoin (and gold) now and start shopping for cheap stocks in two year or so. At least that is my plan. BTW, the biggest chunk of my BTC I will HODL long term.

It is a complete Lightning node, but not a Bitcoin full node. Neutrino is used, thus you don't need to download the blockchain.

People who want their children go to school should pay for school, the fire insurance should pay for the fire department and roads can be paid for in many ways (by corporations that can use it to promote their business, as a cooperation between everyone who want the road to be build / maintained, ect.) But the wars....... Who is going to pay for the wars when expenses for 'public services' are not taken by force?!?!

Sounds likely, take a look at r/ btc, they are obviously doing an anti Lightning campaign. (I destroyed my karma there)

Localbitcoins stopped supporting cash trades, I think that is the reason why the volume dropped so much this week. I suspect most of the trade in Venezuela is for cash, because it is illegal, thus centralised services will probably not cooperate in BTC trade, or at least it is very risky. Venezuelans will have to go to other peer to peer platforms like:
Im sure the need is still there, but the infrastructure took a hit because of the regulators (thanks for taking people their last chance away!)

It will become priority when someone builds a platform where you can swap shitcoins on LN (instantly, almost for free and without KYC), the market will take care of this............

Your node will have a better track record if it is online without downtime for a longer periode and your network is already set up when some mass adoption wave occurs, I think this are the only advantages of being early for your node. However, I think for yourself personally there are bigger advantages. 1- You will gain a lot of knowledge about setup and routing strategies 2: You are way more likely to find a new unexplored businessmodel in LN or jump on it immediately if someone else does.

Wow this guy clearly doesn't have any understanding of Bitcoin. Calling the ability to run your own node socialism is ridiculous! Socialism is taking funds from productive people and giving it to not / less productive people. Running your own node is the ABILITY to DECIDE about your own money whether your rich or poor, this is an entire different situation!

I fully agree, the demand for hard money will increase significantly in the years / decennia to come and BTC will not gain enough trust to replace gold anytime soon. I think both will gain enormously and the final battle between the two will take many decennia or even centuries. I Hodl both and I am very confident for the medium to long term.

If I remember well his show where Roger tried to pump Bcash and callers called him out as being scammer was his last experience with Bitcoin. Maybe he was turned off immediately and didn't do any further investigation. Thanks Roger!

It is only the longest if we didn't bottom yet right? If the previous drop was the bottom it is shorter than 2014 / 15

If you connect the Lightning Network with Plasma, why on earth would you want to use plasma if speed, cost and programmability is already optimal in BTC LN?

Haha, it is exactly opposite: The short term is not so bright (because of the bear market), but the long term is extremely bullish (based on real fundamentals).

Hope it will evolve in a way that institutional investors start to use products like the Unchained-Capital Vault. It would benefit them greatly and the UX is like a coinbase account.
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:33:27
I heavily disagree:
When you have a large group of HODLers who transact only now and then, but when they transact they don't mind to pay a high fee (relative to a spender) you have the most valuable transactions on the main chain (with limited capacity) and thus the most optimal security. Spenders can transact anonymous, fast and cheaply on LN and other additional layers that benefit of the huge security that HODLers bring to the base layer.
People buying illegal goods is not good for Bitcoin at all (I personally don't care, someone should be able to buy whatever he wants as long as it is only bad for himself), because it is a huge source of FUD. What you think about all the huge amounts that get seized by governments and can be dumped on the market? Or all the articles that shady things happen in Bitcoin and that it is only for drugs users and pedophiles? I rather see Bitcoiners HODL and criminals use Monero or cash.

How are they going to prove that you own them? Even if they follow your transaction from a KYC exchange you can have lost your keys. Why pay to sell them? Selling will actually cause more trouble, because then you sold something illegal and that is way more easy to prove because they may be able to link your activity to the transaction.

Our society should learn to catch criminals while they are doing the crime and not take everyones freedom because 'maybe a criminal will use this freedom'. If you want to catch money launderers, catch them while they launder, if you want to catch drugs dealers, catch them while they are dealing but f\*cking not take my freedom to decrease your chance slightly to fail catching these criminals.

If the move to cheaper and often lower quality substitutes is caused by higher prices because of money printing it is a loss in value for the consumer that is not calculated in the CPI index. Also, the fact that other measures come to the same conclusion is no proof at all, it could also mean that it is not possible to properly measure inflation because there are too many elements that can't be measured, something I highly suspect. Furthermore, trying to prove your point by saying that the inflation was falling while house prises were rising doesn't make sense at all, there are thousands of other unknown factors that have to be included in the conclusion.

Huge difference between gold in 2007 and gold and BTC today. In 2007 gold was in a strong uptrend and overvalued seen the moving averages. Today gold and BTC as well just experienced a bear market and are undervalued. When stocks started to fall previously gold started to rise, it didn't drop first. I think gold and BTC are both perfectly positioned to rise in the next downturn of the stockmarkets.

The world is waking up to the fiat scam and start to understand how important hard money is. To serve the entire world with hard money gold and BTC have to rise enormously. The fiat system is literally failing and something have to replace it.

Bad news? Since day one of the bear market there was only extremely good news but it was totally ignored because of the bear market. Huge adoption by financial institutions, great technical improvements onchain, LN adoption exponential and much faster than expected innovation.

Newly printed money takes value from everyone and it will mostly flow into stocks and real estate what is owned by the rich. This will push up the price of houses and requires more debt for the little guy. Compensation for inflation is a scam because real rise in cost of living is way higher than the official CPI index tells us (move to substitutes by consumers covers up a part of the inflation).

Like Wikileaks, sanctioned countries will be heavily rewarded by going into Bitcoin before the masses come in. Sanctions will be counterproductive over a longer timeframe because it creates a lot of wealth and activity in a wealth creating industry by pushing the victimised countries into Bitcoin. In my opinion sanctions (kill civilians indirectly by taking away there food) are as bad as bombs (killing civilians directly) and making this weapon ineffective is a very good thing.

Price is going down, undervaluation is going up. The bear market simply have to rage out, the ones with a strong hand will harvest huge gains in the next bull run. When BTC was 18k in 2017, did you care whether you bought at 200 or 300 USD in 2014? Looking back in a few years will be the same, because the fundamentals are extremely good.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:44:56
Haha, I had the same idea this morning when someone posted on twitter that the daily RSI is all time low. If the price goes to zero the RSI will go even lower, then it isn't bullish at all. I think this chart / RSI thought is very accurate for many shitcoins without strong fundamentals. However, BTC is fundamentally stronger than ever (LN growing fast, Bcash dying, next month psychical BTC on NYSE), so I am fully comfortable with my HODLings. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:56:27
In 3 years HODLers will be called 'lucky' because they became rich and people who sell / are not interested in BTC today will ask you what crypto they should invest in when BTC trades 4 or 5 times the previous ATH.
