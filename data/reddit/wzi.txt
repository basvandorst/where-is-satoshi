It would be a lot easier to visualize the results if a box plot per day were used, each box representing the distribution of prices from the simulation for that day.

And excessive customer loads IS Coinbase's fault. They could easily disable new user registrations until they have their shit together. Even a restaurant I order delivery from will disable online orders if they can't handle the load.
Stop making excuses for Coinbase.

It is easy to think this until something happens to you. I have been using Coinbase since 2012 and then they banned my account with no explanation. Furthermore their account closing interface doesn't include your gdax funds at all and when your account is banned there is no way to access anything on gdax. Unless you know you had funds on gdax and file a ticket they are literally keeping your money. It took almost 2 months for support to respond to my tickets and this was only after I started contacting Coinbase employees on social media.
Good luck.

I emailed them in August and got [this in response]( Even though they had stopped responding to email (at least at the time, maybe they are again now) they still had support plastered all over their help documentation.
I used to think like you since I had happily used Coinbase for years. Then one day they closed my account without any explanation and wouldn't let me withdraw my funds from Gdax. It took over a month to get a response and this is only after I started direct messaging Coinbase employees on social media. I eventually got access to my funds but the entire process was extremely stressful. Given the amount of money they manage there really is no excuse for this kind of behavior.

Yes b/c a 100% increase is doubling your principal or 2x and a 0% increase is no gain or 1x. The mathematicians of reddit don't know what the word "increase" means.

Moving to a new wallet is protection against using the same private key on two chains. If the BCC wallet is malicious, it could access your BTC funds and this workflow prevents that.

    1) Export the keys of your existing BTC wallet
    2) Create a new BTC wallet
    3) AFTER the fork, send your BTC to the new BTC wallet
    4) You can now import the private keys from step 1 into your BCC wallet
    5) You should now have access to both BCC and BTC in their respective wallets
tldr: you use the old private keys for your BCC wallet and you make a new keys for your BTC

Significant withdrawal issues are usually the first sign of insolvency. We've seen this same story play out on other failed exchanges in the past. Hopefully the issues people are having are due to general incompetence and support being completely overwhelmed.
