Did the laws of the universe stop Mt Gox from happening? Did they prevent Heartbleed?

I accidentally read the title as "unfapped" and got all horny, amirite!
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:02:31
Perhaps because you would like to meet a nerdy girl who uses a strapon to penetrate you tight anus?

OP seems to assume this entire community is bisexual males...

Wow... if anyone was idiotic enough to fall for that one, they truly deserved it!
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:11:59
Maybe you're living in your own private fantasy world?

Read that as pornography, amirite!
I do enjoy pornography more than photography.

I hold bags too. I appreciate the touch of an older woman... I thought this made me unique, though.

I'm a troll
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:32:11
Your mother told me otherwise.

Do many things make you think of your rectal orifice, silly sir?
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:59:44


That's when someone calls you  Hitler (and not because you're wearing tight leather pants like Bruno's boyfriend).
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:01:58
That's a good idea - most women have exactly three orifices you can penetrate.

I doubt many African-Americans would be skilled enough to pull it off...
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:15:46


I'm always shocked to see how many idiots believe in astrology and similar elephant shit.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:41:01


Like solo sex? I mean... it's not like anybody here is getting any...
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:11:56
Seriously, silly sir? How do you know for sure there's no better investment advice?
What if someone recommended a boob job so you could land a rich husband, just for example?
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:13:16
I don't like it very much. I prefer the old-style trolling, like those guys who suggest you're gay or something.
Are you?
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:24:15
Are you of the gay homosexual persuasion, silly sir?
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:00:26
I read that in Borat's voice, amirite!
Great success!
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:40:33


Why would this make any difference, silly sir?
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:30:31
ass wallets are the best kind of wallets!
