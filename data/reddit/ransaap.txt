My mutual and index funds have produced an average return of 6% in the last 10 years. If I had a million dollars invested, that would be $60K annual income. Not a lot of money to live off in the US, but if you don't have kids you could manage.

That totally depends on your needs and how you invest it. If you decide to live in a country that has low cost of life and put your money in relatively safe mutual funds or index funds, a million is more than enough to retire.

I've been emailing Xapo about funds not showing up in my account for the past 3 days without a single response. 
BUT today if found this post and pm'd  within a couple of hours i got a response from support asking for payment proof. Could be a coincidence.
Not a good first impression and by the looks of it they're going to have to do a lot damage control. ( Looks like they've been having trouble keeping up since the start of 2017.
Anyway, for the people thinking Xapo is a scam apparently they still have people working there, but it looks like support is very understaffed.
