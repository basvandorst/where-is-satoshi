Consider, though, that from inside a bias doesn't feel like a bias.  It just feels like how the world *is*.  Being told the sky isn't blue won't necessarily make you reconsider the sky's colour.  It takes a separate and *additional* skill to look at a bunch of (opposing, disagreeing) people telling you there is a contradiction, to pause, and to think to yourself "I wonder what this idea looks like from *outside* of me."  There are plenty of people who are quite smart, but haven't mastered this technique.
One of the most helpful things that an outsider can do in this situation is to remove the additional characteristics of the interaction (i.e. the feeling of opposition, the use of derogatory terms, the "respect fight" of threatening to make someone look foolish, etc.) and just patiently explain in tangible ways what the picture looks like from their own vantage point.  Then the "tax" of exerting that second skill is minimised, and it's going to cost the person less to truly consider whether they *are* wrong.

For the record, despite the *inconvenience* of an API outage, our users' bitcoins don't in fact depend on our service.  Because we use a format fully compatible with brainwallet.org users who wish to do so can retrieve their full balances even if our entire site goes permanently belly up.  It's definitely the most control you can have over your own coins inside of 10 seconds!

Hi CMLMinton, Jeff Coleman here--CTO of KryptoKit.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  What you experienced was probably an outage in the (3rd party) API we use to retrieve your wallet's balance.  As unnerving as it is, it doesn't represent any threat to the bitcoins themselves--it's just that without the API the web page can't learn the current balance because we ourselves don't store any information about your account.  Instead, all that information is retrieved directly when the page is loaded.  Your bitcoins are, as always, completely controlled and protected right there on your own computer, so your balance itself was never at risk--just the ability of the page to show it to you.
We [tweeted]( about an issue like this on Saturday--looks like it happened again yesterday.  Needless to say, we're not happy about the frequent API outages our customers have been experiencing, and we are working hard to build a redundancy into RushWallet so that it can check a different API when that one is having problems, and also to include a proper error message that explains what's happening instead of just having your balance not show up.  Unfortunately, as a self-funded startup that offers all our products for free, sometimes these things take a little longer than we'd like.  But if API problems like this are going to be this frequent, it'll become a major priority in pretty short order.
Once again, sorry for the inconvenience.

Duly noted.
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:30:35
Hmmm, you seem to misunderstand.  The secret is not stored in the *actual* URL (it is never sent out across the network where it could be harvested by proxies or network administrators).  The portion of the URL after the ' is only available locally to the already-loaded page within your browser itself.  This is a comparable level of security to any web-based wallet (i.e. Blockchain.info)
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:56:32
I think I've heard an earlier version of this story that was *much* less compelling.  Anyone else think they have a link to it?

Any secret becomes available to all of Reddit if you post it on Reddit.  I can post my HD seed on Reddit and all of Reddit will have access to my HD wallet--that doesn't make BIP 32 wallets in any way "broken".  RushWallet tells you clearly and explicitly never to share your private URL.  This user did anyways--this is obviously not a flaw with RushWallet.
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:38:19
We're here.  Making a post in few minutes that sums up the issue.  tl;dr not an entropy issue or any other problem with our platform.
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:46:41
Thanks for the extra details.  We'll try and take a more in-depth look about how you might have done this by accident.  Chrome OS is an area where we haven't done extensive testing yet, so it will be a good opportunity anyways.
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:34:57
I agree with you completely--we need to step up the *practical* security in the bitcoin space by making **good** security practices **easy** and not just possible.  KryptoKit has some ideas in this direction--hopefully we will be able to share more about them in the coming months.
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:45:18
Yes, that would certainly be sufficient in this case.  In this case, what it means that this wallet was owned by you is that Rushwallet certainly does NOT suffer from entropy issues.  I'm making a full post right now but I think the hint lies in the url you originally posted [here](
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:37:07
This doesn't look like a poor entropy issue.  We are still looking into it but we will make a clear public post when we have reached a firm conclusion.

@_date: 2015-05-10 13:39:40
It's not.  If you choose to include a password only a portion of the hash of the password is included in the URL (to allow the code to know when it has been typed correctly).  With or without the password the secret portion of the URL (anything after the ' is never transmitted across the network.  It is just the easiest possible way to be able to store a reference to a secure, unique wallet right there in your bookmark.
@_date: 2015-05-10 02:55:44
Alright, we've had the chance to make a full assessment of what exactly has happened here.  First of all, let me assure everyone that from our perspective this scenario **does not represent any error or problem with the RushWallet platform**.  Nonetheless, it's worth understanding what went on.  Here are the details:
1)  First, *fortisle* publicly posted two secret RushWallet URL's to Reddit in [this post](  Regardless of the reasons for doing so, the URL *is* the wallet as far as the RushWallet platform is concerned.  The user posted their secret wallet to Reddit.
2)  Second, user *majorpaynei86* read the post and modified the secret url to remove the password portion beginning with "!".  (Some users here are confused:  the password portion does not encrypt the portion before it.  A password can be added to any valid RushWallet and it will "extend" the secret URL to make a completely different secret URL with a different address.  With or without the password, you get a valid RushWallet.  The password just *changes* which valid RushWallet you get)
3)  The second URL so constructed allowed access to a RushWallet containing ~ .06 BTC
4)  As reported [here]( user *fortisle* turned out to be the owner of this second wallet as well.  Because the user who posted the link is the user whose funds were found by *majorpaynei86*, we are confident that this is NOT an example of a "wallet collision" as some had feared.
So what did happen?  Somehow this user created *two* separate wallets, one password protected and one not, that accessed two different RushWallets with different bitcoin addresses and different funds, but using the same secret URL (differing only in the password).  This is not something RushWallet will do by itself without some sort of intervention.  When they posted their secret wallet URL to Reddit, *majorpaynei86* was able to access a different wallet than the user expected, and remove the funds there.  I strongly suspect that *majorpaynei86* is a good samaritan who will be happy to return those funds as soon as *fortisle* can prove ownership of the account (for example by demonstrating ownership of the addresses which had sent funds there in the first place).
And how did those two wallets, one with a password and one without, end up getting created in the first place?  We believe that at least part of the answer is suggested by an odd characteristic of the secret URL originally posted.  Attentive users will note that this url contains a section "?z=8449089".  This element, contained both in the original post and in the modified version accessed by *majorpaynei86*, is very unusual because RushWallet does not work by using these types of server arguments, which are completely ignored by the RushWallet code.  Only the portion after the " which is used locally and never sent to any server, is used to reconstruct the wallet.  This means, for example, that the wallet accessed by *majorpaynei86* would normally be accessed via the secret URL  which is treated identically by the RushWallet code and accesses the same wallet with the same address.
In our opinion, the added portion in the url means that something other than RushWallet itself modified this secret URL sometime between when it was created and when the two links were posted to Reddit.  For example, some URLs may have been mixed up during (repeated) copy and pasting of the URLs.  It would be very easy to paste only part of a password protected RushWallet, thereby creating a brand new wallet without the password, and then to begin using that new wallet.  Or it may be a consequence of the bookmarking system used.  Or it may have been modified by a browser extension or by malware on the user's computer.  In any case, we do not believe that RushWallet itself randomly created two different colliding URL's.  Perhaps if this user is willing to tell us more about the exact processes and software tools they used we can figure out the specifics.  But the fact that a completely non-RushWallet-style element has ended up included in this URL would be too much of a coincidence if only RushWallet itself had been responsible for creating the secret URL in the first place on two completely separate occasions.
Thanks for everyone who took the time to post details and help us look into this.  To anyone who is reading this, please do take the reminder that secret RushWallet URL's should *never* be posted to Reddit unless you are willing to have your bitcoins taken by someone a lot less nice than *majorpaynei86*.  Your RushWallet secret URL *is* the wallet.  Don't post your wallet on Reddit.  And thank you all for using RushWallet!  We welcome any and all suggestions on how we can continue to improve our product(s).

@_date: 2015-05-10 01:35:33
It's also well worth noting that Rushwallets are designed to remain secure only if you do not share the private URL with anyone.  From our FAQ:


@_date: 2015-05-10 01:34:12
Hi fortisle, can you confirm whether or not the account at  as found by the user [here]( is one of your wallets?
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:36:11
I want to say that the friend was Joseph Vaughn Perling and that he tells the story differently than BVN re-tells it, or something like that. (i.e. JVP is a lot less sure it was Satoshi).  Don't know if that helps.
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:28:02
Yes, these things must definitely be taken into account, and of course we cannot be responsible for the behaviour of third party software.  However, in most cases taking simple precautions such as the use of "incognito mode" will prevent browser extensions from running and the URL from being stored in your browser history.  If anyone has questions about particular ways to use RushWallet and the security implications that might arise, they should not hesitate to contact us for more details.  And of course, as coinaday notes below this sort of instant web wallet is intended only for quick/easy use with small amounts of money.  The compromise of a Certificate Authority in the TLS system, for example, would allow someone to simply spoof the site and include code that takes all your bitcoins (and there's nothing we can do about that sort of attack vector).  If you want stronger security properties you need to move to an installed product such as our Chrome extension "KryptoKit".
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:16:49
Ahh, makes sense.
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:31:26
Jeff Coleman, CTO of KryptoKit here.  SatoshisGhost is correct in noting that this situation is exceedingly unlikely to reflect anything involving our entropy collection/generation system.  For the record, our entropy collection system has been carefully examined by multiple third parties and found to provide the protection we claim, and no changes have been made to that code recently.  But more importantly, entropy problems don't actually look like this.  They would be much more likely to manifest in a scenario where an insightful attacker would run a script to bruteforce a large number of possible brainwallets and steal the funds from them.  See, for example, the situation with blockchain.info wallets a couple months back that were swept and returned by a good samaritan.
I'll follow up in a few minutes with a post on what we do think happened in this case, as soon as we can collect all the necessary facts (but I have a strong suspicion already).
We ***do*** thank you, however, for making this post with all the details of what happened.  Something that even *looks like* an entropy problem is the sort of thing you want to raise a major alarm about the instant you see it, and the best possible thing in that event is to have all the facts clearly available.  The fact that in this case it doesn't appear to be an actual issue with our (carefully designed and heavily reviewed) entropy system shouldn't mitigate this in any way.  So you did the right thing!
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:13:17
Yes, it's an experience we wish none of our users ever have to go through (I'm KryptoKit CTO Jeff Coleman).  woodsybear86 was in communication with us by email, which is why we didn't reply here, but for the sake of anyone else who was wondering I can give a general summary now that we have thoroughly investigated the situation together with the user.
The first thing we can say is that we do not believe the loss of these funds represents a problem or compromise in the RushWallet server or software, nor do we believe that anyone directly compromised the user's computer.
The situation seems to be that woodsybear86 was using the brainwallet feature of RushWallet, and had unfortunately selected a comparatively simple secret phrase which an attacker had already guessed and was monitoring, which is why the funds were swept as soon as they were deposited.
This is a horrible thing to experience yourself, with feelings akin to being silently and invisibly mugged in the safety of your own home.  We do strongly urge people who use RushWallet to utilise the built-in random secret generator, which takes only a few seconds and is designed to protect you from situations exactly like this.  If you *do* choose to select your own secret, *please* be careful to follow the guidelines on our [website]( to choose a secure passphrase that no one else will be able to guess (more than 10 words long; using letters, capitals, and numbers; never before been written as part of a book, song, or password system; etc.).  Remember that because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there is nothing that can be done to restore funds if a malicious person is able to obtain access to your BTC and transfer them somewhere else.  Consider carefully if the convenience of a brainwallet is worth the additional risk of someone being able to guess or bruteforce an insecure choice.
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:52:41
Yeah Sean!!  We're so happy with you that this has finally been resolved in the right direction.
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:00:54
If you add a password, the key is not unencrypted.  But our security model assumes that an attacker with access to the local machine can compromise anything short of a hardware wallet anyway, via keyloggers, etc. so the risk on that side is comparable to any other software-based wallet.  The server-related risks of anything delivered live over the web are not to be taken lightly, even though we have taken all reasonable precautions (like https).  For those who want to achieve a higher degree of security than web applications are capable of, we highly recommend installing our browser extension to gain the advantage of being protected by a signed release process (similar to any other desktop application).  It's our belief that RushWallet offers the greatest amount of Bitcoin security which can be obtained in 5 seconds, and that the KryptoKit Chrome extension offers the greatest amount which can be obtained within 30.  To get significantly more secure than either will require a dedicated piece of offline hardware--either an offline computer or something like Trezor.
@_date: 2015-09-19 16:41:43
Everyone has already clarified, but just thought I'd jump in here to comment on this too (I'm the CTO of KryptoKit, we make RushWallet).  Rushwallet is designed so that neither your ISP nor our servers ever see your private key (the part of the URL that contains it doesn't get sent out over the network, it is only used locally by the browser itself).
BUT trilli0nn is still correct below in pointing out that there is a certain amount of trust inherent in every web-delivered application.  If our server were compromised, the code in RushWallet could be *changed* from its current, secure mode of operation to an insecure one that *would* allow exposure of your key.  So you *do* have to trust us to be technically competent enough to keep our server secured.
Beyond that, though, you don't have to "just trust us".  Instead, you can view the unminified javascript source code right in your browser to verify our code in fact does what we say it does:  securely generates a truly random key, and never exposes it to either your ISP or our servers (not even over SSL--we include SSL purely to eliminate middleman attacks and other injections of insecure code "in transit").
Realistically, since most people aren't familiar enough with javascript to do that, you can also rely on the fact that people who *are* familiar with it *have* done that, and that we have been around for a while now without any security compromises, and with a real physical company address that you can come beat us up at if there is a problem in the future :)
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:52:18
Wow, that's terrible.  I usually answer support emails myself and always try to get back to people immediately. I looked into it and the mail account listed in the wallet was being improperly redirected, so no one was even getting the support emails.  This is totally unacceptable to us and we are so sorry!  In the future you should absolutely be able to get a prompt response from that email address, any of our public or personal twitter accounts (I'm  by direct messaging us here on Reddit, or basically by any other method of getting in touch with us.  What was the issue for which you contacted support?  I know it's a bit late now, but maybe we can still help you out.
@_date: 2015-11-20 21:21:41

@_date: 2015-03-17 17:25:55
Jeff from KryptoKit here.  Yeah, that sounds like a rounding issue indeed.  Can you pm me with the transactions in question?  Is this something happening with a lot of your transactions?  And if so, did the other ones go through fine despite the discrepancy?  Appreciate your help in figuring this out.
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:19:21
Other APIs we have used include blockr.io, bitsend, blockexplorer.com and maybe a couple others.  At present it only uses one API at a time, but going forward we are building in fallback/verification methods to provide additional reliability and enhanced privacy.
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:27:10
Jeff from Kryptokit here.  We have pushed a corrected version to the Chrome web store.  It might take as much as an hour to show up for you, but once it does you can update by either restarting chrome or from the chrome://extensions/ page if you click the developer checkbox.  I will post a follow up with more details once I confirm that end clients are updating.
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:57:22
KryptoKit uses online API's from sites like Blockchain.info in order to quickly learn about your balance and send/receive new transactions.  This allows for a much faster, lighter client than a full SPV client, and the only possible risk in the event of that server being compromised is that your balance could be misrepresented in the client or your outgoing transactions blocked--there is no way for the server to steal your bitcoins, because your keys are never sent outside of your own computer, and no code from that website is being run.  Because transactions are not sent through KryptoKit servers, we also do not have access to the details of your transactions--however (theoretically) the API provider could obtain access to this information through their logs.  I hope that answers your question!
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:06:50
Update:  the version in the Chrome Store is now fixed.  To update, please restart Chrome or click "Update extensions now" from the chrome://extensions/ page (this is only visible if you have clicked the "Developer mode" checkbox).
**What Happened:**
Evidently, there is an error in our publishing pipeline.  Every update we send out receives extensive testing, and I myself ran the tests on update 0.35.2 with everything coming back flawlessly--it was a very minor update.  Somewhere between that testing and the publishing of the update to the Chrome store a development version of the extension with critical functionality disabled replaced the tested and approved version of the update, likely due to a build being pulled from the wrong branch of our repository.  We apologise deeply for the inconvenience to our customers and will be completely rebuilding our publishing pipeline before our next update to ensure this does not happen again.
**What this means:**
We have carefully examined the development version which was accidentally published and we have determined that no losses to customer funds would have occurred from use of this version--instead the primary effect would have been to prevent sending of btc.  By updating to the most recent version of the extension this functionality will be restored, and no funds or keys will be lost.  If have any further questions about issues you experienced or about this issue, please do not hesitate to contact us for a detailed response.  We are very sorry for this error, and please rest assured we take even the slightest inconvenience to our customers very seriously.

Hi OneThousandDealer,
Jeff Coleman, KryptoKit CTO here.  Give us a shout via support and we can help you out.  The problems you've been experiencing have been due to the Blockchain.info API, which our chrome extension uses.  We have experienced a lot of problems with Blockchain.info and are in the process of moving away from it, but for now when they go down the extension is unable to send.  As many users have already pointed out, your funds are never stuck in KryptoKit as you can export your brainwallet and import it into another piece of software. One of the easiest ways to do this is just to paste your address into a RushWallet URL in the following format:  and send from there.
RushWallet makes combined use of two APIs, so it has better chances of being able to get around Blockchain.info problems.  If you try to send from RushWallet and still doesn't work you can just refresh the page to try again.  It may take a couple of tries, but even with the recent Blockchain.info issues we have generally been able to send via RushWallet.  I just tried a send and it went through perfectly.
Alternatively you can try waiting a bit to see if the issue with Blockchain.info resolves itself.  Don't know how long that might take though.  I'm afraid it's beyond our control.
@_date: 2015-10-28 21:53:55
Rushwallet is already entirely client side.

@_date: 2015-03-24 17:34:58
Oh, and it's also worth a mention that we are building a redundancy into an upcoming version of KryptoKit so that it won't be reliant exclusively on BC.i anymore--they do tend to go down a lot unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:17:41
Hi Purplekeyboard!  I hope I can give a clearer explanation than some of the vague claims people are making here.  What you are asking is indeed a fair question, and one that was carefully considered early in the design of the Bitcoin protocol.  Let me try and break down why the scenario you describe isn't much of a concern to technical experts such as myself.
**First, the role of mining is not as important as you have been led to believe.**  Yes, it is a necessary and beautiful part of how Bitcoin prevents single points of failure.  But whereas terms like "51% attack" bring to mind the idea that miners are *powerful* entities who hold the entire fate of the Bitcoin network in their hands, the reality is that large mining operations are ***heavily invested wage-slaves operating on razor-thin margins***.  The vast majority of resources they expend to remain in their precarious position go to hardware manufacturers, electricity companies, and labour costs; in the end, these people are completely beholden on a financial level to the broader Bitcoin economy and its continued success.  **There's a reason that mining isn't profitable for most people**--most people aren't willing to invest millions in as tenuous a proposition as the existing mining corporations have chosen to.  And if this wasn't the case in any future period of time, it would rapidly become so again, because mining is as close to a purely competitive market as has ever been invented.  Out of every 25 bitcoins mined, a mining company needs to immediately sell at least 22 directly back to the people they work for:  namely the Bitcoin economy.  In terms of economic power, a 95% coalition of the Bitcoin *market* has **way** more say in what happens to Bitcoin than a 95% coalition of mere *miners*.
But enough economics--let's get technical.  Because on a raw technical level, there's a very real sense in which **the only possible threat a miner can make is to withhold services**.  All other aspects of the Bitcoin network and protocol are guaranteed correct by cryptographic, mathematical proof.  When a technical person hears the scenario you describe, they don't hear "miners threaten to change the protocol".  They hear "miners threaten to stop mining Bitcoin (oh and by the way they are creating an altcoin that you should totally use because it will be REALLY secure at time of launch)".  In short, the new protocol version part of your scenario is a bit of a red herring.  **The only real threat the miners are [theoretically] making here is to stop mining so abruptly and in such a unified fashion that difficulty will take 40 weeks to reset**.  The *particular* payout they propose to extract from this type of blackmail is kind of beside the point.
Is this technologically possible?  Well, last time I checked you could easily obtain large amounts of secondhand sha256 hashing power that would become highly profitable again if even 30-40% of miners stopped mining.  If 95% stopped?  **Secondhand mining equipment would become the biggest goldrush seen in history**.  So unless the miners have the ability to instantly destroy all the old mining equipment out there, this doesn't seem like a remotely viable scenario.  I'd estimate conservatively that the secondhand market could bring 20% of the current hashpower back online under fairly short notice, cutting the 40-week-threat to an 8 week period with blocks still coming more than once an hour during the whole of it.  And that's not even accounting for the much larger incentive bigger operations would have to step in with more up-to-date levels of hashpower (much less the enormous incentive to defect from the blackmailing coalition).
**So let's make their threat more dangerous--instead of just withholding their own hashpower, let's say this coalition is also threatening to continually fork the blockchain, preventing anyone from successfully getting a transaction confirmed at all**.  And if they make this threat credibly, there's no end date on it:  since they would be getting all the mining income from the block reward as well, there's no financial incentive for small amounts of mining power to rally in opposition to them.  We might indeed have to start looking at a fork of Bitcoin to solve the threat we faced.  Only....remember how mining operates on *very* thin margins?  Well, if they're dedicating this much power to killing off OldBitcoin, then all the OldBitcoins they're mining aren't going to be worth much of anything since OldBitcoins are being kept entirely unspendable.  Using the (conservative) numbers from our previous paragraph, **this strategy means burning at least 12.5% of network hashpower (or 13.2% of coalition hashpower) straight into the ground, earning nothing in return for it**.  That's a bigger percentage than their overall profit margin, even assuming that NewBitcoin maintains the full and complete market value of OldBitcoin, which is highly unlikely.  So the threat these people are really making is to go out of business.  *Scary*.
Indeed, it seems like the only credible threat this coalition can make is to **stay** on the Bitcoin network, forking all their competitors' blocks out of existence but still processing at least the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions to keep the larger economy they are so reliant on happy and complacent.  This is still a big problem if the coalition decides to censor a few individuals a la wikileaks, so 95% mining centralisation is definitely **a bad thing**, but in terms of your confidence in 21 million bitcoins, I'd say it's safe we've put the idea of miners changing the Bitcoin total amount to rest.  **If the Bitcoin *economy* decides it doesn't want 21 million any more, that's an entirely different problem, though!**
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:13:12
This is definitely a space we are watching, though with our focus on smooth usability we want all these solutions to keep maturing and expanding before we commit too heavily.  Don't forget that bitAssets also have significant risks, it's just that the process of managing that risk is a little more transparent than with a fully centralised approach like locks and bitreserve.  Vitalik had a good post breaking down the state of the art [a few months ago](

The reason their particular proposal is a red herring is that the community is free to come up with as many proposals as it wants to escape the "big stick".  People generally don't like being threatened with big sticks and are much more likely to just choose a new fork that changes the hashing algorithm (thus punishing the blackmailers at no cost to the Bitcoin economy) over choosing a fork that specifically rewards the blackmailers (at the expense of the Bitcoin economy).   Remember, it's the economy with the far larger share of power here.  If the large majority of the bitcoin economy actually *agrees* that inflation is good and think the miners are just helping everyone make the transition, then you're back to my final point.  Otherwise, your  is completely unrealistic.  The miners simply don't have any leverage to force a full protocol change against the will of the economy that pays them.  Even a small redirection of their resources to fight that much larger adversary will be prohibitively expensive for them.

Yes, BIP70 is definitely in the plans.  We've been doing a lot of behind the scenes work without any public results lately, but definitely look to us over the next couple of months as we bring them out for you to play with!
