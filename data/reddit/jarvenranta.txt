There is a possibility that the people who are impatient to sell some BTC higher (e.g. me) and the people who really want to buy some more BTC cheaply (e.g. not me) are not the same group of people, or at least they don't fully overlap...
@_date: 2019-10-27 20:37:55
Trezor T -&gt; more supported coins, more expensive, has a touch screen which is way more convenient to use
Trezor One -&gt; less supported coins, cheaper, you enter PIN on an on-screen keyboard while looking at a grid shown on the Trezor
Order from their shop directly, you do not want to save a few bucks ordering from Amazon only to learn in 3 years that someone hacked it on the way.

Kraken used to be absolutely horrible until around 1-2 years ago when they finally rewrote the backend code - you had to retry every order many, many times before it went through and sometimes you later saw that it went through twice... But they eventually fixed it all and it's been working fine since then. (Also, one of very few exchanges where you can trade small amounts of fiat without full verification, at least in EU.)

Or McAfee's dick is overvalued by an order of magnitude...
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:41:08
These weren't jokes, that was how it actually worked back then :)
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:52:39
I'm not a TA expert, but I think this is the first time I've seen a line drawn this way...
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:31:01
Dude, Bitcoin was a joke whole 2014 and 2015, everyone knew it was this thing that people bought and then it crashed and died.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:47:58
Very unlikely. I think that would mean the same amount down since ATH as in 2013-15, and the conditions back then were much worse (MtGox etc.).
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:17:29
I think they have enough money not to worry.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:14:49
"I think Bitcoin might go below 3k soon" is a narrative. Mocking people with "sfyl", "������������" or "it's mathematically impossible to go below 5k" is just being a dick.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:10:57
This whole cycle has happened like 6 times so far, and every time people who haven't seen the earlier bubbles think this is the end of the world and that Bitcoin can't possibly survive this and that this bubble must be what finally kills it, even if the previous ones didn't. And then it somehow all repeats again.
Check out these headlines:  - the people who wrote those articles legitimately believed that there was no way Bitcoin could get back to $1k (or $100) ever again.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:18:47
This whole thread since yesterday is basically buttcoin trolls talking to other buttcoin trolls. It's pointless... Maybe mods should be a bit more strict on days like this?
Edit: guess who's downvoting me now
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:12:35
It's just something they say on from what I've seen this week. This is a buttcoin troll, they're just hiding really well.
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:20:51
I would be if I had any money left to buy with... I need a selling season, not a buying season.
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:42:34
It seems to me that this is exactly what it's doing (falling apart)...
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:34:06
Yikes :|
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:35:39
Uh, what
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:37:20
Segwit, LN, the development in Bitcoin Core and all projects in the space in general, people building multi-million companies planning to do stuff with crypto, and so on.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:39:31
"Huge"

My thought before I opened it: "It's Tom Lee, isn't it"...
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:14:05
It's called a bear market, no one is dying here yet.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:49:26
Wtf is a beanie baby
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:16:33
I have a hunch those people didn't have any coins in the first place...
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:00:43
Whales are probably buying it like crazy now OTC with a discount, trying to get the last weak hands who are still holding to sell it to them. And they'll be laughing all the way to the bank while people here will be buying it back for $25k...
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:16:02
Nah, it's 0.055 for ABC and SV is counted separately
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:51:41
And just like that, this thread is empty again... No one's talking about going to zero or double-digit prices, or Enron, tulips or some babies... Weird, isn't it?
Edit: spoken too early, they're back
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:39:19
Name checks out, I'd trust this guy.

Millions of dollars, not of companies.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:20:40
Basically stay away from the daily thread, it's a complete trolltown right now.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:11:55
I've just bought some btc for the first time since April. Screw you bears. This thing is so insanely oversold that even if it's not the final bottom, it needs to bounce from here at least a bit.
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:04:53
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:33:09
It depends if it's negative as in "welp, it's going to 2k" or "lol I told you this shit was worthless it's going to 0 hahahaha"
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:46:39
Just scroll through this thread...
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:58:02
I'm pretty sure early adopters aren't selling anything now, people who bought last year are.
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:38:56
I know...
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:18:59
WTF does this have to do with anything?
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:54:03
Based on what I've seen in the last few years of this market.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:41:19
Someone would have to mine it, which costs money (in electricity) - why spend money mining something that will probably be worthless?
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:20:26
Yes and I'm saying we aren't going there
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:15:00
Edge has pretty bad ux, it seems to be written with JavaScript and web technologies and not native stuff... I use Bread and BitWallet on iOS.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:30:11
Yeah, I'm 90+% down on some alts too, it's ridiculous... I don't know how that's going to go. The major ones will get back (Stellar seems to be doing well even this month), the shittier ones might not. The funniest thing is that some of the most random ones I have are actually up in the last month, so you never know...
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:12:39
Por que no los dos?
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:13:33
Wow, interesting...
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:43:59
Well, worse than before. So, good.
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:48:33
Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:00:37
If no one cared about it, would be empty, so that answers your question...
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:37:59
Of course.
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:06:04
Open a log chart going back to 2012 and draw a straight line going through the lowest bottoms.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:49:28
Almost everything is fine and better than ever... except for the price.
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:39:06
We had a bubble in 2013, and it went from 1100 to 200. Now it's crashing from 19000, and you think it will go to sub 100?...
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:26:40
Oh hey ShortyTheBearTrader/mtgoxxe, nice try
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:40:32
By that logic, a lot of people here expect it to keep crashing further, which is exactly why it won't happen.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:59:55
Per satoshi? It's going to take a while...
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:55:29
14 Jan 2015 for example, ~35% down in 9 hours.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:44:29
Peep... peep... peep... peeeeeeee
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:16:37
Gone? Man, we're just getting started...
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:33:49
What better way to make people take you seriously than spell Bitcoin as 'bit coin', am I right?
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:57:12
You should try to avoid eating whatever you ate yesterday.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:35:13
And the previous few crashes in history that pushed the price down just as much weren't THE crash, only this one is, right?
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:07:03
Because BCH is now ABC
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:51:55
I haven't sold a satoshi since February. No point now, this is the worst period for selling this year. Yeah, of course, you can try to sell and then buy lower, but are you sure you won't miss a chance and be forced to buy for more than you sold?
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:10:17
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:51:45
That was such a nice read and so different than everything else here.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:56:09
Bullshit. Happened before, will happen again. Back in January 2015 it really felt it was over because it like the world stopped caring and forgot about crypto, the situation is completely different now with Nasdaq, NYSE, that Swiss exchange and others all rushing to launch some funds dealing with crypto.
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:58:22
(insert Morpheus meme)
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:20:43
I was hoping we didn't have to do this, but I'm kind of relieved something is finally happening... It won't take much longer. If you're panicking now and talking about continuing to fall through 2019, you're either a bot, or you're new here and haven't seen any long term charts. We can't fall much further (like 2-3k), certainly not for the next year, unless the fundamentals somehow completely fall apart. Hodl.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:42:06
I've heard the BCH trolls shout about BTC going into "death spiral" so much last year that I just can't take anyone who uses that term seriously anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:45:05
Nah, there's still some kind of downtrend line pushing us down, we'll need to break it first to start climbing back up.
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:14:44
The badger is back! I read this in the spring and I was sad it wasn't updated anymore, awesome :)
@_date: 2018-12-23 22:33:23
Upvoted for honesty
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:41:12
So you thought everyone apart from Satoshi already sold everything, and the price is still somehow holding up above 3k despite that?
@_date: 2018-12-23 22:41:00
I like "ThrobbingSausage", lol
