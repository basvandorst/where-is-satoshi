Coinbase wants the right to market the idea - that's not bad for the developer.

Obviously the meltdowns, gloating, and trolling! nydaily and MTV have no idea what they are talking about.

Thank you for your honest feedback, it doesn't go unnoticed. We will work on this. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:37:24
Who did you contact, and what was your message to them? Definitely interesting if they are listing themselves as interested in Bitcoin on the site but are not actually interested in putting their money where their mouth is.

With Bitcoin and crypto currencies quickly gaining popularity across the globe it is becoming imperative for investors to keep an eye out for the next big Bitcoin company. This is exactly why well know Silicon Valley start up incubator, Dave McClure’s 500 Startups, has just brought on Sean Percival as their first Bitcoin focused venture capitalist. Previously Sean was VP of Marketing at legendary social network Myspace, and has founded and sold companies in the tech industry. Sean and 500 Startups are looking to invest over a million dollars (at least) in innovative companies in the Bitcoin industry in 2014 alone.
We caught up with Sean and asked him about his thoughts on Bitcoins, Dogecoins, and mining. Read his answers closely, who knows… maybe he will be the one investing in your next amazing Bitcoin idea.
**[MATT SCHLICHT]( What type of Bitcoin companies are you the most excited about?**
**SEAN PERCIVAL**: Anyone who is getting us closer to mainstream consumer adoption. Also companies who make it easier for merchants to accept Bitcoin. Finally, any companies that are leveraging the blockchain technology in a new and innovate way.
**What product have you seen in the Bitcoin space that you felt was the most innovative?**
There has certainly been a lot of innovation but things are still early. I think we’ve yet to see the killer apps. I hope to find a few of them this year.
**How much capital are you prepared to deploy into the Bitcoin industry?**
We’re still working out those exact details but it’s a 7 figure amount over the course of 2014. With the help of platforms like AngelList we hope to dramatically increase the amount of early stage available capital to Bitcoin companies.
**Where do you see Bitcoins in five years?**
I think widespread usage is still years away, perhaps even 5 years away. I’m looking for founders who can perhaps help us speed things up. By 5 years time though I do envision Bitcoin having impacted our lives in ways similar to how the Internet did in the 90s.
**What are your thoughts on Dogecoin?**
I think it speaks to the power of the Internet and a passionate community. Much of what we do in the digital currency space is about confidence and there’s clearly lot behind this one. However I feel that one coin is likely to prevail and right now the very strong leader is Bitcoin.
**Is 500 Startups mining?**
A small handful of employees mine for hobby and/or profit but 500 itself doesn’t mine.
**Are you investing in purely United States companies, or are you investing worldwide?**
500 invests across the globe so I don’t see how this would be any different. We recently had BTC Jam in our accelerator, a micro lending platform from Brazil. We want to find the best founders out there, regardless of where there might call home.
**Are you concerned that Bitcoins will be outlawed?**
I don’t see that happening in the US. At this point there’s no stopping Bitcoin but over regulation could hinder innovation.
**What is the goal of your upcoming Bitcoin conference?**
With the Bitcoinference I’m looking to help activate the local Silicon Valley bitcoin ecosystem. We’re actually playing some catchup for once with this new technology! So we’re going with an unconference format that allows anyone to share their knowledge with other attendees. I hope 1000s of ideas take flight here and valuable connections are made in March.
**How can 500 Startups help Bitcoin companies aside from capital?**
500 helps in a lot of areas including mentorship, office space and access to the huge network of the 500 family. With my experience specifically I’ve done a lot of work in consumer marketing and community building. So I’ll be pouring that right into every Bitcoin company we work with to help them grow and change the world.
Have a great Bitcoin company you want to take to the next level? [Apply to the 500 Startups accelerator!](

Excellent. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 21:01:29
Thanks for sharing our vid! :) 
We are working hard to create Bitcoin videos every week as well as develop [FollowTheCoin.com]( as a way for people to keep up with crypto news in real time. 
If you actively trade or mine alt coins we also built a [crypto currency dashboard with over 100 coins]( in it (free to sign up).

We have reached out to Lamassu for an interview!
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:48:50
We are experimenting with moving less, we swear! :) 
Go compare this video to some of our older ones and you'll see what we mean. Which style do you like better? (old/this one)

What's your website? :)
@_date: 2014-04-05 21:55:09
Andreessen didn't invent the internet, but he was incredibly influential in bringing it mainstream with Netscape (huge deal). 
Ebay adding a category IS a big deal and they DON'T make decisions lightly. Guaranteed they have had multiple meetings regarding the virtual currency category before they allowed it to go live. (also, Home and Garden is definitely profitable for them). 
WE STILL LOVE YOU THOUGH &lt;3

Interesting. Are you trying to help other startups find investors? Which companies are you helping / have you been successful so far?

She would be more than happy to :) If you are serious you should message her on the site and she would be overjoyed.
