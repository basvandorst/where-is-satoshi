you're comparing a very short-term violent (positive) fluctuation against the stock market's proven ~7% long-term trend. that's wrong.

equivalent conceptually, but not necessarily functionally - as the interpreter that reads the "specs" or the "source code" is non-negligible aspect of the functional component. there would need to be a sufficiently complex spec interpreter to end up with a functionally usable "spec source". 
either way, this is a super interesting concept.

No what I'm saying is that there first needs to be a language that is able to interpret the "specs" (source code). And a language that can interpret extremely abstract but "sufficiently detailed" specs is very complex and itself needs to be written by programmers. 
My point is that detailed specs are not all it takes.

that depends how deeply dystopian you want to get... if there's no electricity and no blockchain, all your bitcoins amount to a bunch of nonsense characters on paper.

You can go invest 10k right now into something that seems risky. Go ahead, nobody is stopping you. Seems like a bad idea, right? You felt the same way then and you were just as justified. 
Don't let hindsight screw with you.
