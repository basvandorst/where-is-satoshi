Lots of Bitcoins are flowing into alts while at the same time not much fiat is invested in BTC now. 
When there are no more alts to pump anymore and the first ones start to crash, people get their money back into BTC which will increase BTC dominance again.
But this wouldn't pump the BTC/$ ratio because real $ needs to flow in to do that. And that's what most people here want because that's what increases BTC value.

Calculating fees is not easy. If they are to high people complain, if they are to low they won't get confirmed quickly. 
Best thing is to manually calculate them via  and considering that the pool may become a bit fuller or emptier until the next block is mined.

While this may be true for certain coins it's definitely not true for all the hyped alts now. This is 90% driven by speculation and FOMO.

There are lots of ways to do it. Whales can use their money to make some more money, people can create pools to fund a LN node. And there are also concepts to balance channels without going over the blockchain (via circular atomic LN transactions) which could reduce the amount of money needed for big hubs.

There are enough explanations about LN out there in all kinds of depth, no need repeating them in detail.
The problem is that there are certain kinds of FUD which is created to discredit LN. Especially the notion that "LN just reinvents banking" is quite common in the moment, so I decided to describe why this isn't true.

A blocksize doubling will probably do nothing. Yes, for a few days after everything would work better, but as transaction costs fall, volume will get up and after a short time after we're back where we are now. 
I think BC could easily have 10 or 100 times more transactions/day as today if transaction cost is lower. So how high should the blocksize go? And BCH offers no real solution either, today it's cheaper just because lower transaction demand.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:22:28
But changing the blocksize would also require a hardfork. Or is there a way to do it somehow else?


Why? (if we change difficulty adjustment to have 5 min avg block time)

Today we have 1369 currencies on coinmarketcaps (probably a lot more already in the making plus a multitude of forks). The growth of the number of cryptos is as big as never before, so this kind of gold-rush wasn't three before and a big consolidation isn't probably far away.

It can’t print cash but it doesn’t have to because most money banks loan don’t exist as cash. For example they may give you a cheque, they may increase a number in an internal database so it shows up in your account, etc. 
Now if all people want their money as cash, the bank would have a problem, this situation is called a “bank run”. But that doesn’t happen generally because all credits are never payed out fully in cash at the same time. 
For example you get your $10000, go to the ATM and get it as cash (from the limited cash reserves every bank has, a bank can get cash by paying for it with central bank money btw), but only for a short time because you buy for example a new car and give the money to the dealer who puts it into his account - and so the cash is gone an what remains are numbers in the database of some banks (which are settled between the banks via a clearing house).

Of course it depends on what you call the "first sell off". If it is from 11-29 then we could go down to 8000, it it's the one from 12-08, then we're already thru the "despair" phase.

Of course not every kind of scepticism is FUD. LN is not a perfect solution but IMO still better than having approx. 250 GB/day new transactions if Bitcoin scales on-chain to 10000 tr/sec. LN is complex, not as easy to use as visa for example, channel funding is still on-chain and requires thinking ahead and in the end it probably needs big "hubs" to make it work efficient and cheap. But what are the alternatives? Centralised currencies, big blockchains which can only processed and checked by bigger institutions? Then why not simply stay with Visa, Amex and Paypal?
But there is misinformation. Created by people who want to discredit LN because if it works it can kill their alts, maybe even before they make them rich. That quite understandable, but I don't think we should let it stand without any objection and without naming it what it is: FUD - created to generate fear and doubt about something.
And small blockchain increases won't work. With 4 MB blocks people would simply create more transactions because fees are initially lower and then those 4MB blocks would be full again and fees would raise until people can't afford it anymore and it reaches some equilibrium. There is a lot of need for cheap online transactions, I suppose we can easily go beyond 10k tr/sec if it's cheap enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:50:16
I agree that it's getting problematic.
Segwit adoption could help a bit, but its adoption still low - but no wonder, even with BC core it's not possible to create a segwit address in the Gui.
Also we seem to reached a point where higher transaction fees won't help anymore because if the network is totally clogged higher fees don't help because there are no "unnecessary" transactions anymore. Fees are primarily necessary to prevent "transaction spam" or lots of unnecessary transactions (like Satoshi dice), but with the current fees and still more and more new transactions, I think those transactions are all really considered important.

The blockchain is used as a means to settle the contracts or to resolve them if the parties don't agree. Like a judge who rules if a certificate of dept is valid or not. Just automatically and mathematically correct.

The argumentation in the first article seems wrong to me. The LN doesn't transmits money, it transmits computer verifiable contracts which can be transformed into money exchanges when the channel is closed. OTOH if you run a full "standard" (non LN) Bitcoin node, you relay transaction to other nodes, so you really are a "money transmitter". 
I am no lawyer so I can't really say something about legal questions. But in the end, with the right laws, it's possible to outlaw anything, even "basic Bitcoin" and of course also BCH. the main question is what is politically wanted.

Banks create money by lending it: “Because banks hold reserves in amounts that are less than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond the amount of the underlying base money originally created by the central bank.” (From wp)

It's not so easy to tell. In the moment 800 sat/byte should get you into the next block. 
But not long ago this was also true for 600 sat/byte, but then the pool filled and now its 3 1/2 hours when the last transaction with this fee went through. And depending on transaction volume and mining speed in the future, those 600 may be processed in an hour, in some weeks or maybe even never. Nobody can say this for sure now.
So if it's really important, you should pay 1200 to get it into the next block. 800 may work but it also may suffer the fate of those 600 s/b transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:59:34
Maybe. But it would require an hard fork and could make people complacent and in 2 months or so we have the same problem again. I think core want to solve the problem now and having &gt;100k unconfirmed transactions give them some leverage to get very fast lightning adoption if it (hopefuilly) rolls out in a few weeks.

"Bitcoin Jesus"? Wft?

@_date: 2017-12-28 19:39:27
I don't see unconfirmed transactions as "bitcoin transactions" because they may be correct or may not be correct. Only if the transaction is confirmed it becomes real. It's like giving someone money, you can give real cash or counterfeit cash (for example monopoly money) but giving counterfeit cash isn't a money transaction. So only if it's real money, it's a money transaction. And this requires that someone checks if the money is real. 
Of course that's not always perfect. The fake money may look very like the real one and the transaction may be reverted later if you bring the cash to your bank and they check it more carefully. The same can happen to a confirmed transaction - even if it gets increasingly improbable for each new mined block which confirms the transaction it's never 100% sure that a transaction is valid.
Now with LN it's really a bit complex, but LN still depends on the blockchain. If someone opens/closes a channel and the transactions don't confirms, then all LN transactions can be void. So the blockchain is still the authority which defines what a valid transaction is and what not.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:23:57
Those are examples. Of course it depends on the bank how much credit it can give. There is also always the reserve requirement, the sum of credits a bank can give depends on their reserves. Some banks have more others less. Also banks often don’t reach this limit because giving credit is risky. 
The point was that banks can give more money as credits as they have. That doesn’t mean cash because banks need to buy cash with central bank money which they can’t create (but they can take loans from the central bank). But most money isn’t cash, it’s only numbers on a bank account.

Bitcoin isn't real money and thus for pure BC to BC transaction money laundering law don't apply. It only applies when fiat comes into play. That's the reason most exchanges are regulated today. But that's not the case in LN, LN has nothing to do with crypto-fiat transactions.
And if this changes in the future, the blockchains in itself will need to be regulated too because for large scale money laundering direct on-chain transactions are obviously not a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:11:10
Transactions which don’t survive the consensus rules are removed. A transaction which isn’t checked, may be wrong (for example because it’s a double spend attempt). Confirmations show that a transaction is valid (at least with a certain degree of validation which increases a lot with each additional validation). 
Of course it all boils down to the exact definition of “bitcoin transaction”. It’s of course possible to define it otherwise. The word “transaction” alone has a pure technical meaning and would also apply to unconfirmed transactions. But to be a “bitcoin transaction” it’s required that a transaction is real an irrevocable or otherwise   Its not the process of transferring money. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:02:29
LN transactions are "contracts" about a future bitcoin transaction. If I give you a certificate of debt and you give me a car, is this really a "money transaction"? I wouldn't say so. 
Of course it's a question of how you define "money transaction", that's why I asked multiple times, what a "bitcoin transaction" means.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:28:53
That is not what I meant by "in the gui", the debug console is just another way of accessing the command line.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:49:20
Again: What should the term "bitcoin transactions" mean in this context?
You can do 1000000 LN transactions without doing a single blockchain transaction. I only consider blockchain transactions as real "bitcoin transactions" because for LN if both parties agree (for example if one party gets all its money back and the other doesn't intervene before timeout), all those 1000000 transactions will never be committed to the blockchain and thus don't really exist. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:56:06
A bank is a big organization. Of course it has $10000 in cash. Now if you take a credit over $100 M for example the bank would probably not able to give it to you in cash. But the bank can still give you a credit over this sum, you just have to take a cheque instead of cash. Creating such a cheque is simple, the bank only needs to fill it out with the right numbers. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:28:53
You can regulate on-chain transaction as easy (or as hard) as LN hubs. Remember that a LN hub can be anywhere in the internet, even protected by onion routing. 
Now you can try to regulate the endpoints in a certain country. But with the same means you can try to regulate all other things in the Bitcoin infrastructure: Exchanges, merchants which allow for payments in bitcoin, etc. So in this regard on- or off-chain are similar. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:03:39
No, because to archive 5min blocktime, the difficulty needs be be adjusted too which in the end would reduce the required hash-rate to mine a block by two. So the miners would mine the same amount of Bitcoin per hour as now.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:45:22
No, putting money into a channel means that you reserve some money for fast transactions. Like going to an ATM and getting some of your money from your bank account into your pocket.


For the same reason we still use paper money: It's faster and more point to point than going over a big database for each and every transaction. Thus it scales better. For cryptos this is even more important than for fiat money because crypto-blockchains are decentralized which means they require much more memory and bandwidth than a single non-distributed database. 


While the Bitcoin inventor was quite intelligent, it's impossible to think everything through in the first stage of such a big project. The white paper is not the bible or something like it, so don't start treating it as such.


Which true on- and offchain. But with LN, its not as worse because the blockchain remains smaller and because the blockchain is still the only relevant authority, that matters more. So even big LN nodes are not really dangerous, but centralizing the blockchain is.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:41:14
But there are a lot of privacy coins now, why not just use Monero for example? I don't think that in the end there will be a place for two different currencies with the same use-case.

With 10000$ (minus reserve) which the bank created by itself. The amount of money isn’t fixed, it can be created and destroyed. The most common way of creating it is by credits. 
To be more precise there are two kinds of money: Central bank money and commercial bank money. Only the latter is created when commercial banks lend out money, they need a reserve in central bank money for that, the percentage is called the “reserve requirement“. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:52:36
If they are regulated or not, they still aren't banks and LN haven't reinvented the banking system. 
They can always regulate the "endpoints" in a country. LN or not. Bitcoin already is illegal in various countries ( 
If you run a full node, it's possible to block port 8333. If you don't run a full node you need some provider to post transactions to the net - which can also be regulated. Of course all this can be circumvented via TOR, VPNs etc. But most people won't do that and would use the regulated infrastructure. So in the end there is no real difference between on-chain and off-chain.
Also regulations aren't necessarily bad. Regulating exchanges for example can be useful to prevent frauds which may harm the whole crypto ecosystem (think of the MtGox crash). Regulating wallet providers is similar.
With LN this isn't as necessary because LN hubs can't steal your funds and LN hubs are no "endpoints". So maybe this will lead to less regulation of LN hubs because they aren't as critical as other parts of the ecosystem. We will see...

It would be nice if a perfect solution is possible, but I fear it isn't. Every solution has its advantages and drawbacks and only the future will tell which one people are willing to accept and which not. Maybe cryptos will even disappear and people will stay with classical banking because it's so convenient and safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:40:00
How high can it go? 1GB, even 10GB+ blocks? This would require block-chain pruning or we would quickly reach capacity limits because storage price isn't falling as much as in the past (or things become very centralized which isn't the idea of cryptocurrencies). Then why no switch to a coins like iota which has all those things (and also lightning etc) build in?
But true, in the short term block-size increase could solve (or maybe delay) the problem. But i don't see it as a something which would survive really wide scale adoption as a useful currency. 
Also a simple 2 times increase as proposed for BC would solve nothing, we need probably at least 10 times to make it only work for a few months or something.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:33:08
Why don't they reduce the time interval to 5 minutes instead of doubling block size? This way not only the volume, but also transaction latency would be improved.

You don't need to trust a LN node! That's one of the central points of LN. If you don't understand that, you know nothing about LN and should learn about it before spreading FUD.

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:03:50
It's not bad to use hubs for transportation. If a Bank would *only* transport money, nobody would have a problem with banks. 
The problem with banks is that banks do lots of other stuff like giving credits, speculating with money, creating money by lending it, etc. Also Banks can go bankrupt which may create a chain reaction which could collapse whole economies, so we need bail outs or in other words, the publich pays for their profits. With lightning-hubs all those things can't occur. For example a hub can't go bankrupt because it has to deposit its money first. 
Also you don't need a certain hub. If you often transfer money between you and a friend, you can create your own channel and let it open for months or even years. There is no limit creating and destroying channels. And you don't need a expensive and difficult "bank license" to become a hub. Just open a channel and publish it to some friends or business partners.
Yes, LN isn't a one-fits-all solution. It would be better if we have a perfect system without any constraints. But all systems have their pros &amp; cons and LN may be better than working with Blockchains which grow multiple TB/day which would happen for bigger payment scenarios and would also create "hubs" because only few organizations could afford to work with this amount of data. But in this case those hubs could control the whole currency while a LN "hub" simple channels coins from one place to another.
So the video (and similar articles) are really just made to create FUD. To promote certain solutions which are much worse than lightning because they would really lead to centralization and would give the control over the whole ecosystem into the hand of few people or single organizations.

The funny thing is that in the end a government are just a lot of people supporting a common set of principles (the "government itself" is just the tip of the iceberg which publicly implement those principles). With BC this is exactly the same, just the way it's implemented is different.

The bank has of course more than $10000 in cash but your credit is only one in many. The bank may have given out $1000000000 in credits but only needs to have a fraction of reserves in central bank money or cash (how much depends on the regulations in your country). If all those people want their credits as cash at the same time the bank can’t give this to them. But generally that doesn’t happen so it’s no problem for the bank. Cash is a shared resource for a bank. A bank may not even give out cash and only allow settlemen via cheques for example.

This is not the same as drawing a simple trend line. It gives a hint that Bitcoin may follow a power law - which is something I haven't read before, so it is new, at least for me. And while its not really hard to draw the picture, you first need to think about doing it first and know about the implications.
And if BC really follows a power law, this would really have some predictive power because it would give hints to the underlying processes of BC adoption - which in turn could be used to predict its future behavior. So it's not the trend line which has predictive powers, it would be the discovery that BC follows a power law.

While I totally understand the use cases for Verge, Monero etc, I don't think that there is a need for many coins solving this use-case.

@_date: 2017-12-14 13:34:22
True, but why do you think that transaction volume would stay this level if cost goes down? It's very likely that BC volume would go up 10 or 100 times if cheap enough. How much bigger should the blocksize get?

LN will scale much better compared to BCH or Bitcoin which probably means lower fees. Also it's more anonymous. And much faster. And it won't enforce a very big and thus centralized blockchain/UTXO-DB as BCH will, if it really gets real use.

Not if they also halve the number of coins mined each block. That's all quite easy to fix. And it would've two advantages over simply doubling the blocksize:
- the latency would be reduced (2.5 min instead of 5min average latencey)
- they stand true to their word that they won't increase the blocksize

“At least one textbook states that when a loan is made by the commercial bank, the bank is keeping only a fraction of central bank money as reserves and the money supply expands by the size of the loan.
This process is called "deposit multiplication". [...]
Banks typically make loans by accepting promissory notes in exchange for credits they make to the borrowers' deposit accounts. Deposits created in this way are sometimes called derivative deposits and are part of the process of creation of money by commercial banks.”

What's a "Bitcoin transaction"? LN transactions are not blockchain transactions, only opening and closing a channel are. And both don't transfer money between parties, they simple prepare and settle LN transactions to the blockchain.
It's not even pure Bitcoin, LN supports transactions between different blockchains, for example between Bitcoin and Litecoin via atomic swaps.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:28:45
You're either misinformed or you're deliberately spreading FUD. LN doesn't holds any reserve, you simply put some money into channels for some time to pay with it later. You can always withdraw it for other purposes. And the reserved money sill resides in the blockchain.
The blockchain still manages your bank account and opening a LN channel is like getting some of your money from your bank account as cash and putting that cash into your pocket wallet to got shopping. In this picture, a LN channel is like cash and the blockchain is like the bank. Opening a channel is like withdrawing some money from your bank account as cash and closing is channel is like depositing it back into your bank account.
The authority is and remains the blockchain. LN is a second layer approach, it doesn't create money (money is created by mining blocks for the blockchain), it doesn't represents money (money is represented via transactions in the blockchain) and it doesn't centralizes the network (the network is still represented by all miners who work on the blockchain).
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:46:49
Thats the reason LN don't need trust: Because you can only pay what you have committed first, a transaction can never end with one side not able to pay the debt.

Only if you want to get fiat from them as with most exchanges today. 
If a LN node just channels money thru there is no need and generally not even the possibility to know who the receiver and the sender of the money are. Remember that LN has build-in TOR support to obfuscate it beyond standard IP-level anonymity. So LN is more anonymous than doing Bitcoin on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:00:37
That has nothing to to with banks. And it can also be said about the blockchain as a whole. If the government want control, it will simply try to control the blockchain.

LN open/close transactions are segwit so its more like 40 million/month. But most people don't need to open/close channels often so this may not be a problem. 
If after some time it becomes obvious that Bitcoin even with LN really requires more transactions/sec, I'm sure that there will be a blocksize increase. But only after LN is working, not before.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:07:45

The idea is to reuse channels, using a channel for a single transaction is nonsense because it would require two transactions instead of one.
The idea is to have a network of nodes which relay transactions: You open channels to one or some of those nodes and then you can send money to every connected node in this network. And of course those channels will stay open for some time.

Having no intrinsic value is actually an advantage. For example if you would use bread as a store of value, it's other use would make it a less useful store of value because you can also eat it or even need to eat it to prevent starvation. Eating it would remove it from circulation and "destroy" all additional value the bread has over its intrinsic value.
That's why fiat currencies also have no intrinsic value: They are just numbers in a computer system or maybe on printed paper.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:23:31
That's not true. 
The blockchain is the core of the system, the final authority, the single-source-of-truth. So centralization of the blockchain is critical because who controls the blockchain controls everything. 
Lightning is nothing without the blockchain, it's just a layer on top of it which makes it possible to transmit money faster. If also holds no authority, all authority still comes from the blockchain. So even if LN is controlled completely by a single entity, this wouldn't give them any authority over the currency.

In the moment with 100/byte, the mempool has to drop to around 70000tx to get your order confirmed. This may take some time. Currently you need to pay at least 300/byte to get a fast confirmation.

If this would be really possible, Bitcoin would be dead, because it's whole promise is that its not possible to steal money this way. So if you think you can badmouthing btcguild this way, you should be aware that you're in fact badmouthing whole Bitcoin.
What is possible with "big hashpower" is to double spend for a certain time (for as long as you have the majority of hash-power). But this would be still visible and also provable in the moment you don't have the majority anymore.

With a "full" SQL injection, a hacker could simply create a new account and put for example 1 Million (not existing) BTC on it. Then he would sell this nonexistent stuff and pick it up with another account for small money.
Of course the problem is now, that there is more money in the system than really exists in MtGOXs BTC-vault (because the numbers are made up by the hacker), so they would owe the buyers of the "money" something they don't have (and nobody have, because the BTC sold simply don't exist).

Why should they store their commissions in a trading account? You store them in an extra database-table for internal accounting but not in a trading account, because you don't want to trade with the money. You simply need some way to count it (for your tax calculations etc). 
It would be really, really stupid to write the system in a way that this accounting is done via a normal trading account.

And why would you do this instead of transfering the money to your own wallet? This way you would have lots of money in a short time and nobody could get it back. The hacker would be very, very stupid it he acted the way you suppose.

Funny, but wrong. In the moment you could immediately sell 10280 BC for a total of 144316$ (probably more because of the dark pool) via MtGox alone. The price of BC would fall to 13.21 $/BC in the process.
There's more money in the market than some people seem to think.

The main reason it that many people don't know about financial and legal stuff and transfer their misconceptions on this situation. 
A rollback is the only sensible thing to do, everything else would fuck up the situation even more than it already is.

This would be done without going over the market. If the "vault" with the real BTC was compromised, the hacker could simply transfer the BTC via the normal Bitcoin network and the money would be gone without the chance of reversal.
But this money was traded on mtgox which means that only a trading account was compromised. But why should mtgox put their vault on a trading account? That doesn't makes any sense.

It depends on the volume. When I wrote the above, the current price was around 15.10$/BC which is of course more than then 14.04$/BC you would gain if you sell 10000. 
There is lots of money in open orders now and if you want it (and have the BC) you can get it. 
Of course if you want to sell for example 100000 BC it's a big different, because you may run out of open orders (impossible to tell because of MtGoxs limited market depth, but I suspect you would and in the 8$ area, because there were huge amounts of orders in the 10$ range when it was visible last time). 
But selling for 10000 BC is no problem in the moment and would only push the price down to about 13.

When MtGox (or a similar site) receives BTC from somebody, they put the BTC in their wallet (which is hopefully stored on a computer which is only used for this purpose and has no running web/ftp/whatever server). At the same time, they add the value to field in the account-db which represents the BTC-balance of this user. If they receive $, they put the $ on a bank account, and add the amount to another field of the user-account which represents the number of $ the user has. Now the user can do trade with his account which only changes those both values on his account according to how he traded. 
That's how such a system works (in principle). Now why should MtGox have such an account for their own money? Sure, if a user does a trade, MtGox get 0.65%, but this money (or BTC) isn't stored in an account, it's simply removed from the account of the user (you can see this in the order history, the values are 0.65% smaller than they would be without fees). While it's likely that they put the amount of money in some table in the Db (for example do to their taxes later), it's not really necessary, because they can always add all BTC in all accounts in their system and compare it to the BTC in their wallet to know how much are theirs (same thing with the $ amounts).
So there is no trading account belonging to MtGox (unless they want to trade, too, but because they control the DB, in principle they could create account with as much money they like, because it's just a number in a DB they control).

If you hack an account, you simply can't transfer the money as you like, because this would reveal your identity. So why not put some big buy orders at 0.01$ in the order-book and sell all the BC you got to pick most of it up for nearly nothing. Then transfer it to some address to pick it up as anonymous Bitcoins.
Edit: This shit is the reason, why "real" stock markets have automatic mechanisms to suspended trading if big price movement above a certain threshold occurs.

I've done some daytrading on MtGox the last week with aprox. 10 self-mined BTC. Made around 5 more with a few trades the day. It's fun and works better then doing small-level trading on real stock exchanges, because of the smaller fees and higher volatility.
En detail:
1. Only a problem if you trade big. Most daytraders trade small volumes but trade more often (which worked very nice with MtGox, because of the fixed percentage fees).
2. Good chance to buy! Daytraders always need enough liquidity expecially when trading without being able to use puts. So in those moments, it's time to buy.
3. This is quite common at "real" stock exchanges, too. The trick is to put "catch" orders in the orderbook early enough
4. No regulation means more volatility.

Why should MtGox have a trading account with all their own money? That would be totally useless and stupid.
People seem to think, that each trade on an exchange trades "real stuff". This is wrong. "Real stuff" is converted into numbers in some DB, those numbers are then traded and if the trader later decides that he has traded enough, those numbers are used to transfer the real stuff between the affected parties.
