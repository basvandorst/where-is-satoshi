What would?

“Instead, a like-kind exchange just passes the original cost basis for the first asset onto the second asset. Gains taxes are then deferred until the new asset is sold for fiat currency, in this case US dollars (USD.)”
I think this means it is not a taxable event. Thoughts? 
Edit: What happens if I use bitcoin to purchase goods?

I sent a test transaction from GDAX to airBitz of .0001 bitcoin. I had seven confirmation within 20 minutes. With all of the comments I see on here about slow confirmation times and high fees, can someone explain why this took so little time with zero fees but other transactions are slow and expensive?

Can you break down the taxation? If I convert $100 to .001 bitcoin and then trade the .001 bitcoin for IOTA when the .001 bitcoin is valued at $90, how does the irs look at that? Or if that .001 bitcoin is worth $200, how does the irs handle that?

That was a fast soon

Are all exchanges frozen or just gdax?

I see a lot of comments about transactions getting rejected, fees being too high, and the amount of transactions waiting to be confirmed in the mempool. What can be done on the individual level to help with this? Organizing a group to mine, wait for LN, hope it figures itself out?

With all of the comments I see about 1-4 days and sometimes the transaction is even "cancelled", yes I would say 20 minutes was fast because of where the current expectation is. 
And it takes about 5-7 days for a transfer to be completed between my bank and GDAX or between two bank accounts I own for that matter.

I’m confused. It was my understanding that the telecommunications companies lobbied the government to allow them to build an additional tax/fee into our bill to help pay for the infrastructure but then kept the hundreds of billions of “revenue” without making promised upgrades with the earmarked money. Am I wrong?

If you have an investor betting a short of Bitcoin, who is the lender? Do you need a third party (investor and an exchange being the first two, I’m assuming)?

Looking at that tx on blockchain.info, it looks like there was a $31 fee. Am I reading that right?

GDAX is down too. I would imagined that none of these exchanges have the cash on hand to pay out everyone if everyone sells, right?

From what I have read this can be bank dependent. USAA actually incorporates Coinbase in their user interface if you link the accounts. I just opened a Cap360 account and I’m waiting for the funding to go through so I can purchase btc. What bank do you use?

I’ve read that it’s best not to keep your coins with the exchange because if too many people do this it centralizes the currency which is inherently against the idea of bitcoin and there is really no personal benefit to keeping it in Coinbase.
I just started researching bitcoin two days ago so I know very little and I’m just curious what your thought are about that statement.
