a bit is 1/8 of a Byte. Its a value that can have 1 or 0. It may sound "cool" but its totally retarded to use it as "nickname" for millibitcoins or microbitcoins.
So, to ftfy: ~~2000 bits~~ 2 Satoshi

Especially Germany.

You are optimistic. Its probably less.

Never leave any money in you PP account. They may ~~steal~~ freeze it any moment. Transfer it daily (or hourly) to you bank account.

But facebook would need to reveal the IP of the poster if requested by a judge.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:40:44
You are wrong. POST is more secure if another person has access to the computer, because POSTed vaues are not stored in the browser history.
POST can also be made very secure by using HTTPS, unlike GET where you would see the transmitted data in the URL in cleartext.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:59:53


But not the URL, and if your password is in there, SSL is pretty useless.
@_date: 2014-02-02 12:01:06


This is probably the best advice.

If you give your money to criminals then don't be surprised if they don't return it to you.
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:35:43
They were not fined, they just paid the government off with some of the money they made. The usual thing, well.
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:49:37
Wait. The government now has to prove that you are actually guilty before they can take your stuff? Outrageus!
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:43:34
No, they just paid off the government so law enforcement would not look too closely.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:18:57
Dogs that bark don't bite.
But I'd still go to the police.
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:44:32
That's how the game works. Every time.
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:36:13
So how is that not bribing law enforcement to not look to closely at a case?
@_date: 2014-05-21 07:53:39
After Google's random banning of AdSense accounts years ago, and then Google's random banning even of some large AdWords accounts some years ago, and then Google's random banning Google+ profiles in the time after the launch of the product... I thought this was just another of Google's random banning rounds.
Glad to see it is not.
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:34:24
Your move Google, Microsoft, Yahoo. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:42:41


How much is that in % of what they made off those clients?
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:48:30
Just a question: why is the "The" Bitcoin Foundation?
Why aren't there many different foundations that have the same goal to promote Bitcoin? Wouldn't that make more sense? The bad ones will die, the good ones grow. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 12:03:01
Except when its real criminals who want their money washed. Then the banks pay 10% or so of the illegal earnings to the government to make sure they are not prosecuted. Yey!
@_date: 2014-06-28 15:39:06


Why would you need that in this case?
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:19:42
Get over it, guys!
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:06:48
If anything, it shows that Google Play is not a reliable partner for any serious apps.
@_date: 2014-07-08 10:06:22
I don't think that's what said.
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:04:35
Doesn't work for me. Just tries [1 btc in eur] but nope, just the normal bad search results.
@_date: 2012-08-28 06:41:53
Hey, I am an anonymous dude with a website and I promise you to make you many monies with my super secret investment strategy. Can I haz all ur Bitcoins?
I mean, seriously, how stupid can people be?
@_date: 2012-07-31 07:30:40
There are still no automatic barriers in these trading softwares? For example, if the price goes up or down by more than 15% in 10 minutes, trading will be automatically stopped until an manual review has confirmed the authenticity. Seems like common sense, especially for something as new as BC.
@_date: 2012-12-30 20:43:28
No, not the one child policy. The same happens in India, too. But there is no one-child policy there. What makes baby girls disappear is the stupidity of village people. Only economic (and therefore educational) progress can change that.
Though, China is the only country in the world with more female suicides than male suicides.
@_date: 2012-12-30 20:54:47
not average. the word you are looking for is majority, maybe?
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:43:40
We will when karma sells for 200 USD a piece.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:49:08


But... that's how the economy works in the real world.
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:30:15
You mean, just change the very basics of human psycology and make reality adjust to your ideology. Yeah, no thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:54:13
Didn't know that one. That is up to pair with "There is a world market for maybe five computers" by some IBM CEO in the 1940s.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:41:00
That's alright. In bubble economics, they call it "euphoria phase" or something.
@_date: 2013-02-24 19:43:02
Go to the police.
And: this is not robbery, but theft.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:10:31
I guess in a month or two we will know how to correctly name this phase :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:12:11
So they want to tell you what you can and cannot buy with *your own money*?! 
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:30:48
i get a 404 on that page.
@_date: 2013-03-06 10:11:35
This is my main worry regarding bitcoin. It allows to move illegal money around and to avoid taxation.
Edit: LOL, I so knew I would be downvoted by the fanbois here, even though this will be the primary concern for governments and poses a threat to the existence of btc.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:02:05
Not being able to print it certainly is an advantage. Although: 
@_date: 2013-02-24 19:48:48


That's a terrible and sad advise.
Trust people, but think before you do.
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:05:38
Try to cross any country border with more than 10k USD cash in you bag then. I'll get confiscated. Guess why. 
Same goes for swift transfers over 10k -- you have to explain where they come from. 
There's a reason for that. Protip: the reason is the "dumb" part of my original post.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:16:30
Maybe they already invested a lot of the 1bn and want the price to get up faster.
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:00:29
But they are not.
Go to Somalia if you want "no government". They're having fun there.
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:48:36
"foresight" is what people who took a risk and got lucky like to call it.
@_date: 2013-02-24 19:54:25
Then it would be XBI, because it should take the first two letters, and not some random letter from the middle of the word.
BTC is fine.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:14:35
You made all the others look like idiots. They are all self centered alpha males thinking of themselves as being the culmination of humanity. And then a intern comes along and tells them of a technology that is disrupting their own industry, and they don't even know about it? Of course they will kick you out. They have to, each to save face in front of all the others. But be sure that most of them were googling for bitcoin as soon as they got home that evening.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:37:59
Great summary. While the technical problems can probably be solved in later iterations of a crypto currency, I am really pesimistic about item 3.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:12:05
The richer you are the happier you will be about that sort of switch. VAT taxes the poor far more than the rich. Not sure that'll fly here in Europe, people don't like to take from the poor and give the rich, and they will want their gov'ts to make sure it doesn't happen.
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:19:50
I had a website like that for many years, until some Google update :(
Still not willing to sell it though.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:09:48
What?! Its basically the bank sending you a list of things **they** allow you to spend **your** money on.
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:22:28
What you described is not a trojan. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:23:15
Only because you managed to make an important discovery about a narrow and specific topic (and got the Nobel Price for it) doesn't mean you are a genius and know everything about you entrice field. Its just humanities' need of idolization.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:11:42
Best advice ITT.

"I gave 1200 USD to a random stranger I found on Google, and after two months, the guy ran off with my money. No, I didn't ask for his real life identity or identification, why?"
What else would your reply be?

Ultimately, the PLA. They have the guns.
