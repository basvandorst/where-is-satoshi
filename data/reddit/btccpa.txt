With the direction and attention that bitcoins are headed and receiving, I would not be surprised. The great thing about laws in the US is that with enough power and connections, you can structure it so it benefits you.

IRS likes taxpayers to use the FIFO method (first-in, first-out). So you got the 50 BTC at $5 first, so they'd be the first to go out. But it is your bitcoins, you ultimately get to decide which ones you get rid of first (it'd be smarter to sell the $5 ones first if you expect prices to rise, the higher cost of the $10 would bring down your taxable gains).
In reality, this doesn't become an issue with the IRS unless you're trading a very material amount of bitcoins as a business ($100,000+ IMO)

Haha, look, I know there are different intentions with bitcoins. Some of you are out for the investment, some of you are SR users, and some of you have no clue what it is, and some believe that it will change the world as we know it. PM me and i'll be straight with you.

What's an upvoted challenge?
Groceries are definitely not like-kind, but lets say you shopped at a grocery that only accepted bitcoin. If you bought bitcoins to shop at this store, it is wrongful to be taxed wouldn't you agree? Let's say you traveled to Mexico and converted dollars to pesos so you could buy groceries. Would you report the gain (if Pesos jumped in value)? Probably not.
This thread is definitely over my head, but I can safely say, that the idea of bitcoins is also over the head of IRS agents and accountants around the nation. You can go into many firms and ask about bitcoins and they won't even have a clue, even at this point in the game. IRS audits are also very much like court. You can defend yourself and your reasoning behind your reporting methods. Having an accountant (like a lawyer) will more likely win your case. 
I mentioned it being a complex question because all bitcoin transactions are complex in the eyes of Tax law. It depends on intent. Are you buying BTC to make money, or are you buying BTC to hide money? Or are you buying BTC to send to relatives, domestic or international? I'm very inexperienced in bitcoin reporting, but I assure you there are no bitcoin tax professionals out there. I am experienced with dealing with auditors though, and as long as you make a good case, sometimes compromise, you're in the clear.

Yes, one would easily argue that mined and gifted coins aren't taxed until sold for $$$. Income is a good or service you receive for your goods or services. You could declare them as capital gains anyways with a cost of zero. But lets say you mined BTC and sold for $3,000, you'd be taxed at a capital gains rate, 10-15% perhaps if Short-term (received and sell within a year). Let's say you bought computer hardware and used utilities totaling $2700 to mine those $3,000 worth of BTC. You can offset the cost and only pay tax on the $300. 
As for the gold coin profits, they will eventually be taxed. If you were completely abiding by IRS Tax laws, the cost of bitcoins you used to purchase the gold, would be your new cost basis in the gold received. Eventually when you sell the gold, you'll subtract the total amount received by the amount you paid for the BTC.
EX: $50 to buy 1 BTC, 1 BTC goes up to $1,000. You use that 1 BTC to buy $1,000 of gold (but your basis is still $50), when you sell gold for $10,000, your cost of that is still $50, making $9,950 taxable capital gain

You're correct, in 1031(a)(2), I should've thought of a better example than stocks. The truth is though, there is no code section in IRS laws that specifies what you should do in this situation. You can be very conservative and report the lower of cost or fair market value of the BTC ($1) as the cost, and exchange it for FMV of stock worth $50,000, creating a taxable event.

Great question, I sense that we're in similar industries. I guess I should've been clearer and note that there could be different treatments surrounding bitcoins. For me, it is definitely an investment vehicle, I don't mine at all. I just buy, hold, learn, and think of ways this could integrate into the global economy. Maybe I'll sell later? 
But another bitcoiner could be mining, and using Avalon machines to mine coins and sell them on an exchange. This scenario allows you to deduct the hardware costs, because it is your active occupation as you will be mining. You'll probably spend a lot of hours doing this and it could  possibly become your full-time job. I could argue that mining is active, if you can prove you spend more than 750 hours a year 'mining', then it is considered active I believe. You'd be hit with self-employment tax in this scenario, whereas I'll pay capital gains tax on my investment.
Yes it does make a difference, but its very complex and differs depending on the situation. If you mined and ran your own business out of your house, you can deduct the business percentage of house. You'd be hit with self-employment tax if you are owning your own hardware and operating it yourself. On the other hand, you could be invested in a partnership or LLC that is operated by others, and the net gain/loss of the LLC would flow to you or make distributions. It can come down to the cost benefits in the end, you may rather pay SE tax and not set up an LLC, or vice versa depending on what you desire.

Depends on how much risk you want to take or how conservative you want to be. You could trace the date to your wallet or exchange as to when you received the coins and take the average price of BTC at that point in time, multiply it by amount of coins, to calculate your cost. That's what i'd do if I didn't have any records or documentation (I know some IRS agents do this also if they have no other option) 
Depending on how much you sold it for, the gain could be drastic. You could report $25,000 extra income if that's what you sold it for. If you're making an average US worker salary, and report that, it could set off flags for an audit. Combined with the tax hit you take from that gain, and the hassle of an audit, I wouldn't use $0 basis. Unfortunately there's only one way to report it, on your schedule D. Even if it cost you $100 to make that $25,000, make a great case in your audit and you'll be fine.

But they've also made some of the best. They make thousands of picks but its only that the bad ones are remembered. They chose netflix, chipotle, apple, intuitive surgical, and many other multi-baggers as they call them (300%+ gains) picks. I believe it to be a great source for people to start their research, and the decision in the end lies on them. Just my philosophy.

Great question! But what's the circumstances? Is Bitcoin S&amp;T a holding place and they lost your wallet or were they hacked and you lost everything?
I believe the right thing to do is to keep documentation of when you purchased the bitcoins and for how much. Then you can either report it as a capital loss on your schedule D (if you bought bitcoins as an investment) but you are limited to $3,000 losses against your income each year. But these carryforward, so if you gain $3,000 the next year, but lost $15,000 last year, last year you can deduct $3,000, and next year, deduct another $3,000, making your net gain $0. 
Another method is if you bought bitcoins as a personal collectible item and it was lost/stolen with criminal intent, you can deduct the whole thing on your itemized deduction, after subtraction of $100 of the loss, and further subtract 10% of your AGI from your total loss.
Example: You lost $20,000 of bitcoins. You made $100,000 at work this year. Subtract $100 of the loss to $19,800, then subtract 10% of your income ($10,000), to get to a loss of $9,800. This amount would be added to your itemized deductions, potentially bringing down your taxable income.
Please note: When you report anything involving bitcoins, especially higher itemized deductions, you are more likely to get audited!!! So keep proper documentation, retain an accountant if need be, and keep in mind the 5 P's: proper preparation prevents poor performance!

Oh because they forced you to take out loans and invest in securities right? How exactly have banks caused you problems?
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:27:19
Because you're not speaking the truth, what theft are you speaking about exactly? If you're smart enough to protect yourself from the banks, why aren't other people?
I understand the use of bitcoins, but I also understand the need for banks. Are you aware that many of the businesses you use as a consumer, rely on banks to operate? What sane business owner would risk all of his money when he can minimize his losses by using loans from banks to expand and pay his employees? If its successful, he pays interest. If not, he can declare bankruptcy and be free of paying back the loan.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:11:53
How exactly would you report it as income? Most income comes from a W-2, 1099-Misc, or a distribution from a company. If you are buying bitcoins, and selling them, i'd consider that a capital gain, not income. You shouldn't have to lay down money to gain income, you usually lay down money for capital, an asset, or an investment. I don't see the service you are providing to gain the income. 
I don't mean to pester, but I'd like to see your reasoning to broaden my knowledge. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:40:02
From what I understand, Bitcoins are really under the umbrella of what the IRS considers foreign currency. It is easier to argue that it is a capital asset, but it comes down to your intention. If you plan to hold them to sale them when the value goes up, you can/should treat them like any other LT capital asset
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:08:07
I'm not suggesting anything. The idea behind bitcoin is very vast. Of course I believe everyone should pay taxes on gains, does everyone though? No. There are many vendors that accept bitcoins and do not report their income by selling their goods. Everyone here seems to think of bitcoins as an investment vehicle, but it could be anything depending on the user's intent. Would you consider pesos an investment vehicle? When you exchange your pesos into US Dollars, do you report the gain/loss? I'm just doing my best to give out advice.
This isn't Wall Street, I get to be on everyone's side. There are some anarchists that want to hide their money in fear of it being seized. There are people who think its ridiculous that if you work 5 days a week, one full day's pay goes to your government. Then there are people who are grateful for our society and want to contribute. Depending on your intent, I'll do my best to present to you possible scenarios. Right now, I don't think its realistic that people would get audited unless you do things to raise flags. Such as having no income but with Bitcoin gains, you donate a bunch of money to charity without reporting the gains. There are so many scenarios that could play out, and at the end of the day, I don't make the decision for you, I just help you reach your goal.

No unfortunately not, Uncle Sam needs the money! Gold gains are taxable in the USA. There are only a few exclusions in the tax law that make capital gains tax free, your principal residence as for one.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:35:49
Yes, the cost basis of each amount you sell. It could become a very huge accounting nightmare, and very difficult to calculate exactly (since they're from a variety of sources, and you don't get to pick which coins you're selling, it gets very complicated!)
So yes, to simplify matters, you could just declare with a cost of zero (i don't recommend).
Mined coins don't have to be subject to capital gains tax, you could reason with an IRS agent if you are audited that you mined them, earned them yourself, and sold them as a good (like a merchant would). I wouldn't bother going back to amending returns, its a lot of hassle. Going forward, I would just keep track of electronics, utilities, and anything you pay to keep the mining operational, and offset this amount with the amount you receive from selling mined bitcoins.
Gold coins purchases dont have to be reported until you sell them, and the cost of the gold coins would be the value of bitcoins at the time you transferred them to the gold seller.
You could just hire an accountant if you need help reporting the transactions. I don't think there are any accountants out there that have faced this kind of phenomenon before. A lot of people out there still don't know what bitcoins are. The tax laws are still very open to interpretation in regards to bitcoins, but I would say most accountants would treat it as if it was a stock or collectible.

Don't downvote this guy! He's partially correct. I believe that I make more money than I should in real life to do what I do. I just want people to achieve their goals and help them think about the consequences of their actions.
Please take my advice with a grain of salt, I know you bitcoin buyers come from a variety of backgrounds, but without getting a full financial picture of you (goals, risk/conservative, etc), I can't give you completely-sound advice!
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:08:00
Very good complex question. It actually depends on what that something you're buying is.
If what you're buying is an investment or capital asset, you could exchange it straight up. Lets say those 1000 BTC were worth $50,000 to make it easy. You'd trade those BTC for $50,000 of Stock. Like-Kind exchange laws say there is no taxable event, but the $50,000 worth of stock you just received, is worth the $1 you paid for the 1000 BTC. So you sell all that stock, you pay tax on the $50,000 - $1 cost basis you had (if you decide to sell the stock, correctamundo Zefy_zef!)
But if you're buying groceries or something along those lines, you do not have to report taxes.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:41:20
I'd really like to answer this question!!! I need more background though. What is your goal? Do you want to do the right thing? Or the selfish thing? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:08:10
Unlike stock transactions, where brokerages will send the IRS the cost you paid and total proceeds you received, bitcoin transactions don't get reported to the IRS. You could think of it as holding onto a very old collectible penny (from 1800's or so) and selling it $10,000 dollars today. You may receive a check or cash from a buyer at an auction or so, but no one tells the IRS about this trade, and who knows what the cost was for you to get the penny in the first place.
If I was a 100% complete honest taxpaying american, I'd report any gain by taking the amount I received in total after sellling the bitcoin and subtracting the amount I paid to get the BTC (including fees), even if the gain was only $3.
If I was trying to save and squeeze every penny I could to feed my family, I would wait until the IRS specifically creates a ruling for bitcoin. Until then, unless I was having $10,000+ deposited into my bank account quite often from a BTC exchange/merchant, I wouldn't report anything.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:48:26
In practice, I've yet to see anyone report it. There wasn't much selling in 2012 since it was still stable and lower than $15, but I expect 2013 to be a little different. 
Yeah I would say very likely to get audited in 2013. Most proceeds through brokerages are reported so the IRS can match up gains/losses within reasonable amounts, anything outside this is a red flag. It makes it even more of a red flag when the IRS sees these BTC profits without any form of reporting whatsoever, so please keep documentation for large transactions just in the event you get audited.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:47:22
Well i'm using this as a learning experience because as of current tax law, there is no classification of bitcoins It's not considered foreign income, not an investment, there's nothing about it. I've ran scenarios in my head and bounced it off some friends at the IRS and it could go a variety of ways. In 2012, there was very little traction in the price of bitcoins. Not many people were making the fortunes that they made these last few weeks. So like you said, it wouldn't cost them a material amount if they were audited. But I agree, Anything 4-figures and above should definitely be reported.
Also in my line of work, you'd be very surprised to see how many people do the legal thing. As a CPA, you can't force a client to report everything, and you can't force them to sign off on the return. It's why people like Wesley Snipes and Mary J Blige get in trouble with the IRS, they become outraged at how much of their income they have to pay to the government and refuse to follow what we advise. Us accountants don't want trouble...
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:25:38
In a complete law abiding situation, the first time when you sold, a taxable event occurs. If you bought 1 for $10, and sold it for $100, you should pay tax on the $90. If you then bought 1 for $50, no taxable event occurs until you sell it. Lets say you sold it for $10, both transactions occurred in 1 year, you have the first $90 gain, then the $40 loss, that year you only pay tax on a net gain of $50.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:11:33
Thanks for the tip! Very generous of you. It depends on the magnitude of your gains. If you withheld enough last year and didn't have to pay taxes over $1,000 at your time of filing, then you don't have to pay estimated tax payments. If you have a job and they withhold enough, and your tax liability isn't going to be over $1,000, you don't have to pay quarterly estimate. But if you are cashing in big, and withholding little at work, and expect to pay more than $1,000 at time of filing, then yes you have to pay quarterly estimates otherwise you'll be hit with an underpayment of estimated tax payments.
I do many projections for Ultra high net worth individuals so I'm always calculating their quarterly estimate, especially when their capital gains are in the 7-8 figures! PM me if you have more questions!
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:09
Since Dwolla and Mt Gox require vast information from you, I assume you want to play it right and safe. The right thing to do would be to report the gain at the point of sale. Just because you don't take USD out of the exchange, doesn't mean there isn't a taxable event. Just like at a brokerage, you have money in money markets, buy some stock, sell it, and the money goes back in the money markets. Even if you don't withdraw from the money market, there was a taxable event when you sold, so you should report that gain. 
If you are earning interest from Bitfinex (haven't heard of this, very interesting though), then yes, you have to report the interest earned. The difficulty lies within how much interest you report. One day the total interest could total $50, the next, $20. The safe bet (in my expertise) would be to calculate the exact amount of bitcoin earned from interest throughout the year (1/1/xx -12/31/xx), and convert that amount to USD by using the exchange rate at 12/31/xx. Report this amount as interest income on schedule B of your 1040.
3) Look around the thread, really depends on the situation :/
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:56:43
Yeah, I could argue that you could write it off, as long as you didn't file your taxes. You can only claim the theft or loss in the year it occurred, but you got 3 more days to file (or more if you're going on extension)
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:16:35
On my schedule D, as a capital gain, and use dates from bank statements/Mt Gox statements as to when I transferred funds to buy BTC and sell them. But even I think that's playing it real safe. 
I'm fairly confident that this would be an appropriate way to report them. The gray area lies within if BTC are an investment or asset, or if it will be considered a currency. Such as if you transfer USD $ to Yen, and you transfer it back to USD $, you still report it on your schedule D
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:56:41
Not trying to mean harm, just trying to get an outside perspective. Did they steal from you? How much was it?
