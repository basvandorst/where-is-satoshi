It will shoot up to 10k tonight only because I just sold some btc I bought at 6,500.

Never understood why couples will spend 50k on a wedding, go on a honey moon and then go back to their apartment.

Thank you for your advice.  I will try the SD card with the most current firmware and see if that does the trick.  I know people were having trouble finding a secure download to the most current firmware to install though, so a new adventure to find out where I can find that, as KnC doesn't have that openly available on their website.  Thanks again and take it easy.

The loader spins for about 30 seconds and then it says "Oops, google chrome couldn't find 192.168.1.xxx (which is the ip address that the router assigned the super Jupiter).  I've been reading some people saying I have to insert an sd card (that did not come with the unit) with the current firmware downloaded. Could this be the problem???

I was asking for help at this point, not a smart ass comment from some random short-bus that has no life and finds it sadly self satisfying to make fun of others for legitimate questions to serious problems.  There is zero help from KnC on complete assembly of the super jupiter, configuration or troubleshooting any type of problems...even though a video was promised over 4 days ago.  On top of that, there aren't any straight forward and complete answers from any google/forum search on this EXACT topic.  I spent time searching on my own and couldn't find a definitive answer, so I reached out for help from this wonderful, well mostly wonderful (talking to you short-bus) community of Reddit.  Each day is a decent chunk of $, so sorry for wanting to figure this out with some urgency.  I'm sorry your life is so sad Essexal and maybe you should just do the world a favor and take a long walk off a short pier.  Life is too short for people like you.

Gonna buy some btc tomorrow. Figure it will either pay off in the long run or I get a first class seat on a crashing plane. It has been something that I have believed in for years and it is a great buying opportunity now. My belief is no where near as strong as it was 6 months ago, but I will also be really be pissed off at myself if it does start to rebound and climb back up and I didn't purchase some.

Watching that video reminds me not to try and day trade.

Nope, just gonna send it to a cold wallet and leave it there while I stress out watching the roller coaster for the next 5 years.

I understand. Like I said, I have been playing around with btc for awhile now. I'm only gonna put 1k in my account, buy $500 worth now. Wait a few days and see what it does and maybe pick up the other $500 worth. Figured I have spent more than that in a night out in vegas that I don't remember, lol. Might as well get in on it while it is (hopefully) cheap. Thanks for the reminder about only gambling what you are comfortable losing. I have been reading these forums for a long time and it sucks to see some of these people put way more in then they should of hoping that they would get a Lambo 2 weeks later.
