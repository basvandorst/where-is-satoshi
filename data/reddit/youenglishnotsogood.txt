My comment has nothing to do with the conversation. 
You must be a liberal.  I’ve discovered liberal argument logic:
(1) take a stance
(2) if your stance is ever questioned, say “Yeah, I agree in most cases. But this case is clearly different!”
Example: (1) be against name calling.  Who could be against that stance?  It’s a great stance for adults to have. (2) get called out for name calling. Say “yeah name calling is juvenile. But, in this case, name calling is clearly acceptable because muh fee fees”. (3) Don’t realize that the reason people often resort to name calling in most cases is because they are angry that they can’t come up with a valid argument. (4) Realize that you aren’t a special snowflake.  You just have different rules for everyone else than yourself. (5) Grow up?

I wasn’t defining whether it was good or bad.  Ironic, though, that you e resorted to name calling.  See rules

I tried this 3 times and the transaction kept failing.  Do we have to wait until aug 1?  Or have you done it already?

Do you think the brothers etf hearing in march will affect price near that time?

I seem to be having problems with my connection. It keeps connecting and disconnecting.  Have you heard of this?

Chance of banning approx 0%.  Too much money to be made.  They’ll tax and regulate instead.

You really freaked me out scrolling though my messages because my name is actually Sean. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:33:24
And the fight will be legendary. Banks, govt will regulate and make illegal to hold and tax and try to make it taboo to transact without them. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:30:33
It's not your fault.

Idk. Googled it when I found the email and apparently the guy who owned it was sentenced to 6 yrs in prison for money laundering.  
The threads from when he was arrested said you'd have to call the FBI to get your money back. Sounds like a big hassle and it may be too late.

I found old emails yesterday where I bought like 0.5 btc on coin.mx in 2013. Wonder if I'll ever see that again.

I always see people on Reddit saying "I literally lol'd". I thought they were weird. Now I've done it, too. Take your filthy upvote. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:40:43
Lol. True. How about moved the decimal place over a couple of digits?
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:04:57
Seriously, those conversations could have been from an hour ago if you added a couple of decimal places to their usd's.
