You're saying the complete removal of the concept of credit is the goal of bitcoin?  A requirement?  Why would anyone *want* that?  It's something that could happen today with fiat currency but it exists because it's something people want.

What is bitcoin fundamentally for?

You only bring up the bailout which is something that happened after the market crashed.  How would bitcoin have prevented the crash in the first place?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:06:16


What do you base this off of?  Bitcoins value has dramatically dropped and raised in the last months alone.
I don't see how Bitcoin does any of the things you say because ultimately it's value is solely the value the market gives it.  Nothing inherently in Bitcoin will prevent deflation or inflation because it cannot react to the market (which is what fiat currency was built to do).

The idea behind a mortgage and credit isn't changed when the currency is.  It's not dependent on fiat currency.  If the world ran on bitcoin and I did not have enough bitcoin to buy a house a bank would purchase the house in bitcoin for me and then own the house while I slowly paid the bank for the house over time, eventually giving me the house when I've paid my debt.

Alright, lets start over then.  What's the point you're trying to make with this post?  What connection does The Big Short have with the importance of a decentralized currency and how would a practical use of Bitcoin fit that role?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:40:37
How would bitcoin have prevented this?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:51:17
Do you have any sources that compare the effects fiat currency has on speculation compared to something like a gold standard would have had?  From some quick research I can see bubbles and crashes have been happening long before fiat currency.  Is there evidence suggesting " Removing the gold standard led to extreme money expansion and made bubbles even worse"?

The ability to adjust the number in circulation allows the Federal Reserve to limit massive inflation or deflation.  It's an intentional and beneficial aspect of fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:27:34
Do you have sources for any of that?  I can't find any sources stating the Federal Reserve "printed" any where near 29 trillion dollars in a year let alone 3 months.  I'm not sure they've printed that much in total since 2008.

Bitcoin is becoming a Ponzi scheme.  People cashing out now are doing so with the money coming in from new investors.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:48:58
Can you explain the difference?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:48:42
Like I mentioned in the other post the biggest benefit of a fiat system is the ability to adjust the currency to combat inflation and deflation.  With Bitcoin we would have no way to compensate for the inevitable deflation.  There's a reason we moved away from the gold standard.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:53:23
Wouldn't not having control of the supply of currency mean there could be inflation or deflation if the currency cannot keep up (or far exceeds) the actual economic growth?  If BTC can't be generated fast enough to keep up with the economy the BTC you earned last year could now be worth a quarter of a year's salary the next year.

Whatever OP is referring to when he/she said:


I'm not asking what can co-exist, I'm asking how this future superior currency is going to be any better than fiat.   
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:17:22
I don't understand what your point is.  OP is saying crypto is a "superior currency" because it will solve "debt" problems.  I'm saying debt will still exist.  Are you saying it won't?
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:20:37


I disagree with this and I can't imagine why BTC can't be fractionally reserved the same as fiat or gold standard currency.  
Why would you earn more BTC by holding on to it?  50 BTC will stay 50 BTC twenty years from now.  Are you assuming the value of BTC will rise 5% annually?  
And am I misreading your second half or are you agreeing that debt is still going to be a thing with crypto?
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:22:51


So you admit it's not stable and any stability is entirely hypothetical at this point?


So you agree that Nash never agreed Bitcoin was the perfect currency?  Mind you, you're the one who implied he did by saying he didn't like altcoins and implied he thought Bitcoins were the solution.


Are you saying Bitcoin fixes inflation because it has fractional reserves? (Your wording implies this but I'm assuming it isn't what you meant) Because other people are posting it's difficult to do fractional reserves with Bitcoin.  Are you implying it will fix inflation because you cannot use fractional reserves?  If so, what does fractional reserves have to do with inflation?  How does fractional reserves solve debt problems or how does the lack of fractional reserves solve debt problems?


I feel like you're misunderstanding fundamental concepts here (or I'm misunderstanding your point) because you contradict yourself back to back here.  You're saying holding money will beat an index fund which would only happen if inflation is higher than the ROI on an index fund (currently it isn't).  You then say no one would loan something that is deflationary (which is the **opposite** of inflation you just stated would happen) and I agree.  No one would loan you in a deflationary currency.  But a deflationary currency would be **devastating** and **catastrophic** to the global economy.  It means ever dollar you made today would be less by tomorrow.  Economies would collapse if the main currency was consistently deflationary.  


Explain to me in your own words why someone would not invest money with an expected increase in returns with a "sound money environment" in your own words.  Because that's the entire point of public stocks and has nothing to do with the currency it is traded in.

I don't see how bitcoin fits any of that criteria.  First sentence in your link:


Are you saying that bitcoin has a stable value?  You don't need to answer that because obviously it doesn't.  Are you saying that some day it will become stable?  How so?
You (and others) keep stating that bitcoin is going to end debt cycles.  How?
Your second link is a series of reasons why bitcoin isn't considered "Ideal Money", because it isn't stable. Nash also admits Bitcoin might not be stable enough to be Ideal Money.
Even if Bitcoin magically was stable it still doesn't fix the debt cycle.  People will take loans and buy stocks in companies.  Changing what currency is being transferred amongst parties doesn't change how that system or cycle works.
You do understand that bank loans and stock markets existed before fiat currency, right?
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:12:30
Why would the two be any different?  If the USA sells treasury bonds for BTC or decides to borrow a million BTC from China it's the same problem.  Why would crypto remove any kind of debt?
**Specificially** explain to me how a digital commodity currency would remove the possibility of national debt?
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:50:14
A gold ingot cannot be in debt because it's an inanimate object that can't consciously take on debt. I agree with you, Bitcoin shares this distinction.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:24:43
How does crypto solve the debt problem?  If crypto is the main currency people will still take out crypto loans from banks to pay for their houses.  Debt doesn't exist because of fiat money.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:35:30
Issues caused by printing (or destroying) fiat money are recession/depression and don't cause debt problems.  Those problems are caused by the unstable value of fiat currency.  Is crypto expected to maintain a stable value if it becomes our main currency and if so, how will it accomplish that?
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:48:57
What?  I honestly don't know what you mean.  If I take out a bank loan for 1,000 BTC so I can buy a house and I can not make the payments on that loan I lose the house because I'm 1,000 BTC in debt.  I don't understand what you're saying? 
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:33:26
What debt currency exists that can't exist with crypto?
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:59:36
I'm confused, you're saying "almost every single country in the world" is in debt because they took the "money out of the air" the Fed Reserve leant them?
