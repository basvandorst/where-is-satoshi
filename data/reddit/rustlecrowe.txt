Yep! Im a town planner and i cannot help but draw parallels to traffic flow modelling. The analogy of adding lanes on a freeway is spot on.

Well imo the most liquid coin makes the best currency irrespective of fees. 
You cant argue fees / tx time is the only important feature of a crypto and then ignore the 900+ coins that scale better than. Thats disingenious

Bitcoin core has the largest team of devs with proven track record. I think theyll create a l2 solution well before bitcoin cash. And well before the 8mb are even remotely used. Bch devs dont have to just make a t2 solution they have to do it BEFORE core and in the mean time hope for some level of exponential growth (far greater than btc) to even justify the need for it. 
If fees are 1 priority why not used some of the other cryptos? 
Ethereum handles 2x the transcations per day of bitcoin at a fraction of the cost. And its cheaper than bch. And raiden will bring 1mill tx per second by q3 next year. 
Bitcoin by design favours security over scalability. Even with the best devs im not sure it can exceed other cryptos specifically designed to scale eg raiblocks

Yet bch does this worse than other cryptos like ethereum.
Which btw does 2x bitcoin tx a day at a fraction of the cost of btc. And also cheaper than bch. Raiden network will bring ethereum to 1million tx per sec q2 2018. 
Bch might have competitive advantage directly compared to btc. But to every other crypto out there its got very little to none.  Its not bcash vs bitcoin its bch vs every other crypto

Theres a lot of books and audiobooks about it, its a really fascinating case. 
The silk road by eileen ormsby (and her 2nd book the darkest web covers SR 2.0)
American kingpin by nick bilton is a good read and audiobook. 
Really good free podcast is the casefiles silk road 3 part series
Just picked up the dark net which talks a lil about SR early origins
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:49:23
He was charged with the king pin charge, which means mandatory life sentence. He actually recieved 2 life sentences AND 40 years. 
Look up “lux” the worlds most infamous child porn hoster who setup the largest child porn empire to ever exist and even created new categories of kid porn like “hurtcore”. 
He got 15 years and will serve closer to 10.

Yep, i dont think it is fair. lux was trialed in australia afaik. Different system but vastly different sentences.  One thing that helped the pedo was that he never profited from the hosting of child porn, it wasnt profit geared like the SR was for dpr. They made an example out of dpr.

Who knows. Control maybe? 
Interestingly this article was written before all the Bcash drama. He’s antics attaching bitcoin lately aren’t doing him any favours either 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:23:56
I guess what I'm trying to say is what I see when I look at this graph I see three big spikes..
The first when the normies invaded in June, the fees/$ spiked up and to $5 and then only a month later it was back down to $1.5. 
Then came august and the bcc hard fork and we saw another huge spike from $1.5 up to $9 and then less than a month later it was back down to ~$2. 
The end of october (bgold hf) and early November (b2x drama) has seen fees go from $2.5 at the end of october to now $20 in mid november. 
These things are all external factors (normie invasion, miners/hashrate + corporations) we can't judge bitcoin during the peak of these crises and extrapolate its impeding failure. 
All I'm saying is lets just wait and see until what the fees drop back down to before we go around calling people hitler :D
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:34:40
Who says bitcoin right now is a finished product? Who says you won’t be able to buy a coffee with btc in the future (with little to no fees) ? 
Fees weren’t such a contentious issue 6 months ago, now they are. Let’s see if they still are in 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:38:34
Which is BS IMO! because you are clearly competent enough to engage but people like you feel scared to comment/post because of the downvotes you’ll receive from the troll armyss. It really has gotten out of hand now

For someone with a self proclaimed ‘limited understanding ‘you actually understand what’s happening. 
Blocksize increases is a linear equation, everyone in the community is hoping adoption of crypto is exponential. There is a conflict here. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:44:52
Well litecoin is basically btc with 2.5 minute block times. 
from my understanding keeping block size the same and decreasing block time you would increase the network requirements for nodes as you would now need to send the 1mb block back and forth within X minutes instead of 10minutes. 
But I would be interested to hear from someone who knows more re: how this compares to a block size increase in terms of scaling etc 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:47:16
A huge theme of Bitcoin is about decentralising power/control and the NYA agreement was signed behind closed doors by corporations/miners. I see why everyone is so resistant 
The fact there’s no replay protection probably doesn’t help 
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:28:14
So I guess to go back to your original question re scalability. 
Btc currently can do 3tx per second. We go from 10mins to 5 mins with segwit btc. We now can do 6tx per second. But visa does 3000tx/sec in peak times. So to keep scaling we then go 2.5 minute block times. Now we can do 12 tx per second! But we are still nowhere near visa. So we then half it again. Now 24tx/sec and 1.25 min block times. And so on..
It’s a linear equation but the scaling problem is exponential (btc becomes more popular, more people use bitcoin and The more avg transactions per user). 
You are also hedging that technology improves fast enough in a way you can half the block time (double the network requirements) frequently enough to ensure blocks aren’t full. That would mean you couldn’t just go from 10mins &gt; 1min. You would need to progressively decrease it  (10 &gt; 5 &gt; 2.5 etc) and that could take years before the tech catches up. Not to mention the logistics of forking every 6months/year 
We need an exponential solution to scaling should bitcoin be considered a currency in my opinion
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:06:57
Just want to say while litecoin has a max blocksize of 1mb it’s never full so in reality it’s less of a problem (avg block size 25kb) It would be interesting to see how Ltc would handle congestion if we were getting 1mb full blocks every 2.5 mins 
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:15:15
Yeah thats a great setup to have. I know what youre describing and would be an optimal setup. 
The wiki article makes it out to be possible with USBKILL
It can also be used in reverse, with a whitelisted flash drive in the USB port attached to the user's wrist via a lanyard serving as a key. In this instance, if the flash drive is forcibly removed, the program will initiate the desired routines. "[It] is designed to do one thing," wrote Aaron Grothe in a short article on USBKill in 2600, "and it does it pretty well.

@_date: 2018-03-28 02:29:53
Interestingly as a result of ross arrests things like USBKill have been created
Creating a whitelist of known USB devices, any outside usb drive triggers the drive to be encrypted or deleted etc..
What you describe could be achieved by having a whitelist USB connected via lanyard to your neck 
According to ross wiki article it sounds like the feds distracted him with a fake “lovers tiff” which ross got involved in. An agent quickly went over to his laptop and used a usb ducky to retrieve his password from memory and then they arrested him and confiscated the laptop. 
I guess the best security is to mind your own business

VISA does 3000 transactions per second with very little fees. 
Bitcoin with 1mb can do maybe 3 transactions per second
Ok now the block size is 8mb and you can do 24 per second. 
Then we double it again in a year so now we got 16mb blocks and 48 Tx per second 
We still not even close. That's the issue. It scales linearly and we will never compete with centralised payment systems without segwit and off chain lightning. 
For me that is the salient point. Technically there could be merit to increasing 2x but it feels like a bandaid solution to me

Yeah im going to try paidbycoins for my next bill. Over a course of a few bills this seriously adds up. 
LSOR can charge whatever they like, but consumers will always go for a better deal.  It irks me a little the way lsor advertises “NO FEES”
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:50:39
I wish it was $1. Its a lot more than that. A $500 bill becomes closer to $540 and thats a fair difference
