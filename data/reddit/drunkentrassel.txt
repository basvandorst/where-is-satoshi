Worries me that they are so active spreading their poison gospel. Japan is a huge new market, would suck if they manage to subvert that community. Does anyone work to spread the Core narrative in Japan?

Running BU is saying 'I am not the sharpest tool in the shed'

Considered it. Even believed it for quite a while. Now it is blatantly clear they are scum

You forgot immutability. That's a big one.

You seem to believe both sides have equal merits and agenda. BU is an attack on bitcoin and should be treated as such.

This is very important information to make visible. A version of this should be stickied. Support from economic nodes is overwhelming and should be used for all its worth.

Thanks BU

This makes me severely angry at Ver, Vu and the rest of the scum that willingly tries to destroy bitcoin. They are succeeding as we speak.

Still waiting for that bw segwit signaling on litecoin btw. Guess your credibility isn't all that good either.

Lying, then personal attacks. You seem like a great guy!

Day traders are not behind bitcoin's epic push. It's broad and organic demand from people wanting to hodl bitcoin. If anything, it's this dip that's caused by day traders.
