Are you kidding me? I was in every city in germany, this Döner is the freaking best, its almost wrong to call it a Döner.
But you also have to say, tastes are different :)

Berlin here, nobody I know knows something about Bitcoin. My girlfriend even refers to it as "Monopoly Money"
@_date: 2013-08-25 11:16:36
Ah ok. The renewable energy market will probably boom more the next years in Germany, so your chances are good. 
Our company is only recruiting for IT but their are some recruiters  We even have a recruiting day for the field in november, even if its in cologne. 
Your knowledge of German is rather irrelevant, as we are recruiting from all over the world to make up for our lack of professionals. For living, in Germany it is necessary for Germans to learn english to get a degree, so you will have no problem. Besides, most companys I work for offer German lessons.

Oh totally. But here are atleast some things that are bitcoin related and a lot of newbies seeking help. seems like its been made completly out of 14 years old dudebros.

You would have good chances in Berlin, if you want you an send me your CV and I could show you what your possibilities are.

18y7WZx1t6ubPmAreszNrncTX1XR76WzYB here for cocain and hookers send 1 BTC to this adress and you will probably get an awesome party when we hit 1000 dollar, if I'm not dead or have better things to do. xoxo

We have a booming economy in Berlin so I don't think you should have a problem finding any Job if you have a master in a field. 
But as you pointed out I'm not working in this field and I am unsure what companys you could work for. Is it more something you could do in an NGO or something for chemical company? Because we have a lot of both?
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:35:42
No problem. Protip Unsubsribe the stupid major subreddits like and plus und use good content subreddits like and others that fit your preferences. Reddit can be so awesome without the same bad circlejerks every day.

I'm using Bitcoin more as an investment. I showed her how much more worth my Bitcoins had in a really short time.
But for her it's still not real.

I'm not living in Kreuzberg, I was there a few days ago because it is near my work. But there was nothing that caught my eye. But I need to admit, I didn't really watch.
But if you're moving to Kreuzberg you need to eat a Kebap at "Mustafas Gemüse Kebap" best Döner in Germany!

Yeah, she is not smoking and is not really interested in e-cigs, but really happy that I'm not stinking anymore. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:49:28
But the shipping cost are probably pretty high :)
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:07:27
It goes both hand in hand, if you are from outside the EU it's a little bit more difficult but with a good recruiter or other people that helps you it is not that hard. Also if you are a professional in the it field or engineering it is pretty easy to find a job.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:20:50
I hope it is at 500, so I can buy in and be happy if it is at 2000 in two months.

Yes your frontpage depends on the subscribed subreddits you are at.

You need to think that the law system in Germany is completly different to the one in the US. Coperating with the police give you good credit in front of the judge and this is the only thing that counts in the end.
@_date: 2013-10-06 08:43:54
No love for Berlin :(
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:29:03
Damn probably no shipping to Germany.
@_date: 2013-09-12 12:48:47
I'm so thankful for this, as a German who usually uses paypal with ELV (it is a German paying method which is often not accepted by American sites.) this is my only chance to get a humble Bundle.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:59:06
are the three I'm subscribed to. can be funny.
Also my crazy subreddits are and but these are only for people that want to laugh about absolutly batshit insane social justice warrior.
Personal tip and the second one for an awesome shave :)

Why in Frankfurt, we all know the real shit goes down in Berlin.
We are new, we are fresh, we don't care about the bankers, we are the change and Frankfurt doesn't stand for change, Berlin does!
I would love to organise a party, for 1000 Dollar p.p. I will bring a guy that put cocain into your nose until it comes out of your anus and a prostitue will lick it up!
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:18:16
I think it's more because she was growing up in a household in the CCCP. Capitalism is all about numbers that are completly fake. They're people that have billions of dollars but never saw them in person.

Hey man if you need some tipps just message me. I was born here, it's one of the most exciting citys of the world.
I would love to give you a tour but I am awaiting my first born in september :)
Things you need to check out: 
Museums: We have a large varity of them, check out the museum Island in Mitte, its awesome!
Party: Here you have the free choice. Bars? Go to the Simon-Dach-Straße in Friedrichshain, around 100 bars in walking distance. Clubbing? Grab a 030-Magazine its free and you will find anything you need.
Kreuzberg is one of most amazing districts in Berlin, it's young, fresh and a little posh. But it's a lot of fun.
Friedrichshain is the alternative scene of Berlin.
Prenzlauerberg and Mitte are the Posh districts.
Neukölln is a district that is in coming for the past 3 years and is exploding with live(life?).
You need to check out the eastside galerie. Its a part of the old wall and will be destroyed in the near future.
Also don't visited the Fernsehturm(TV Tower) its bullshit for tourist. You will find somebody who can show you a nice roof where you can see all of Berlin from.
So I think that will be enough for now. If you need a job (I expect you already have one) I'm recruiter in the IT field and can give you contact to other fields also.

Hm, that is reasonable. But my girlfriend probably kills me when I order 1litre of juice :)
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:03:02
Sure, mail me your CV I will PM it to you!
