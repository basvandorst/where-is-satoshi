Actually I am considering setting up an ATM, but I want to only sell/buy anomously, as I am against centralized direction EU is going.

and I am not located in the US so it does not concern me that i'm not sending the amounts directly, and by sending directly from exchange then I only function as a broker where I actually does not hold the assets myself(private keys).

" Although virtual currencies can frequently be used as a means of payment, they could also be used for other purposes and find broader applications such as means of exchange, investment, store-of-value products or use in online casinos. The objective of this Directive is to cover all the potential uses of virtual currencies. "Futhermore it says somewhere that virtual currency is used as payment as person and person and therefore falls in the same category as  monetary value and thus same rules applied(I assume).

It's mentioned in multiple reports(here is one open in my browser tab), so we cannot say that 'virtual currency' is not defined as bitcoin/cryptocurrency:"Not all monetary value that is stored electronically should be considered as e-money in the context of the EMD2. Limited network products such as gift cards and public transport cards that can only be used with a certain retailer or a chain of defined retailers are outside the scope of EMD2. Also, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are not considered as e-money as they do not represent monetary value. "source: [

DarthCoinMaster; Are people in Bitcoin reddit really this stupid, I am trying to find out legal justification to sell/buy bitcoins Anonymous. I am against the AML/KYC procedures "required". But you have to operate *within the law!*

well, taking into account that running a bitcoin node yourself requires 200GB plus and finding a server/VPS separately for that. as supporting most coins would then be easiest to send directly from exchane. so what I asked is; what common delays does people experience(delays outside the realms of bitcoin network confirmation time - with resonable fee) - this is why I asked if sending directly from the exchange wallet was a better alternative than using a hot wallet, as I would like to have as little bitcoins(directly from exchange would mean I only fill orders on demand / cryptocurrency on my own hands at the time.
So asking if it's reliable to send directly from the exchange and asking what peoples experience is, then I don't find myself in over my head.
I think you misunderstood my above mentioned question, if you are able to answer me then I would love to hear your opinon/experience.  
What I am asking, can I deliver bitcoins/other cc's within a satisfying timetable by using my exchange wallet as main wallet, so deposits goes directly out from exchange wallet and withdrawels goes directly out from the exchange wallet.  
My choice is between above mentioned bitfines or bitstamp(bitstamp has 0 withdrawel fees), so might be cheaper to use, what are your experiences using directly from exchange or am I missing something?

Okay, I think I gathered what I needed, that since the 'amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, and amending Directives 2009/138/EC and 2013/36/EU' has not been implemented in most member states.But...in the future, like within the year, when member states impliment the amendments, what would you interpret the limits for Anonymous transactions for cryptocurrency to be (1000 eur?), how can ATM operators justify that a person won't make multiple 1000 eur transactions other than limiting 1000 eur value pr. crypto address?  
Or...simply no more  Anonymous limits for ATM operators?  
(I am talking about only the EU directives, not local states laws implimented)
How can I justify Anonymous limits in my AML policy to comply with the 2018 amendments?
\- Would love to hear a laywer or a person that could give some advise I can use in a legal document.

The 1000 EUR is already passed as law and HAS to be complied;  
In  The Netherlands: Go to a post office/bank and pay a utility bill with fiat exceeding 1000 EUR and you will be required to show ID and it will be logged by the institution(required by directives). if not exceeding 1000 EUR then you should not be required to show ID, unless they have a national law for lower than 1000 EUR (but law in The Netherlands has to be compliant with EU regulations, the national laws can only be stricter)

..... DIRECTIVE (EU) 2018/843 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 30 May 2018 amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, and amending Directives 2009/138/EC and 2013/36/EU
there has already been amendments thats are IN FORCE, and I've linked to it in another comment...

I would love to hear another interpretation that could allow fiat large limits without verification, but I am unable to find it, as I see the law very clear when you read everything available.

But will KYC/AML requirements be required for ATM operators with for example 1000 EUR Anonymous transaction limits? (in accordance with AMLD5 - as limits/thresholds for virtual currency is not mentioned)
AMLD5 has lowered limits for pre-paid cards and e-money etc. but any specific limit for virtual currency has not been mentioned for cryptocurrency in the regulation.
This is why I want to know, what should I set my ATM Anonymous transaction limits to, and what area of the law(directive 843, 849, 847) would you refer to; to justify the threshold/limit for Anonymous limits to operate within the legality of AMLD5 and other related directives?

castorfromtheva; incorrect:  
[ read whereas; point 8..." Providers engaged in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies (that is to say coins and banknotes that are designated as legal tender and electronic money, of a country, accepted as a medium of exchange in the issuing country) as well as custodian wallet providers are under no Union obligation to identify suspicious activity. Therefore, terrorist groups may be able to transfer money into the Union financial system or within virtual currency networks by concealing transfers or by benefiting from a certain degree of anonymity on those platforms. It is therefore essential to extend the scope of Directive (EU) 2015/849 so as to include providers engaged in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies as well as custodian wallet providers. For the purposes of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), competent authorities should be able, through obliged entities, to monitor the use of virtual currencies. Such monitoring would provide a balanced and proportional approach, safeguarding technical advances and the high degree of transparency attained in the field of alternative finance and social entrepreneurship. "
This actually put Bitcoin ATM operators under the same rules as Financial institution.
Limitations before verifications should go under the Directive (EU) 2015/849(Chapter II,  Article 11) 1000 EUR limit as a minimum, and you have to take measures for transactions not to be linked, etc.and blockchain is traceable, so you have an obligation to report *Suspicious activity* when coins are swept to a common address (FIU not able to accept blockchain reports yet though, but you still have to do it)
