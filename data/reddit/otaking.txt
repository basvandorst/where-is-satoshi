It's crazy that things have to get this bad for people to start believing it.

I get really tired of people like you complaining about this, and then downvoting. You clearly don't understand what the downvote is used for while neglecting the body of the piece. So, here, have this downvote for contributing nothing to the conversation--what they're meant for. *You get a downvote, OP gets a downvote, I get a downvote. Everybody gets a downvote!*

Gox supporter? Heh, I wouldn't be surprised if this was directly hired. They're honestly in a desperate situation right now. It brings the other exchanges down to their level so they don't completely die and attempts to legitimize their PR statement that temp-crashed the market.
Their statement was very specifically written, very purpose driven. I hate conspiracy theories, but this whole things smells.

That's simply not it. It's far easier and more profitable for a novice miner to get in on scrypt coins, and dogecoin is incredibly welcoming and takes care of them and all of the dumb questions. There's a proper community. The meme is dead, but it's superseded by the coin itself (and honestly, this surprised me a bit. I knew it would gain a stupid amount of attention, but the community actually has kept it alive).
BTC can use different units (micro), we're seeing that more and more.

I have to agree with you that it's a possibility. There was so much silence and secrecy beforehand which made everyone uneasy. Their PR statement which temp-crashed the market was carefully crafted and spun. They're desperate. There's millions of dollars on the line for them. Their business is literally money. With that amount of capital, you think it's out of line for them to arrange something like this? It forcefully legitimizes their statement and also brings the other exchanges down with them, so that they may not get left to die.

Nope, three. That's the threshold. Three people loitering = Move entire business operation.

They're saying this has been happening since the 8th and continues to happen.

Money is to currency as square is to rectangle.
Money is typically considered a coined or printed medium of exchange, while currency includes a broader spectrum of *something* used as a medium of exchange. For example: Gold is a currency. A gold coin is money. Or, another example, salt was a currency used to pay Roman soldiers.
