On my mobile but May 2012 was definitely higher, and a couple of months before Jan 2013 might have been higher.
Regardless, price has been relatively stable of late. Definitely the most stable price has been post-Silk Road.

This is a perfect example of Bitcoin. Two people just sent money between each other, neither knowing who the other was or even which country they were located in. Zero fees. Instantaneous.
I could add that no one was able to block this transaction in any way, except changetip have the power to do so in this example. However, if had posted an address such as 1H7JMkpK93yTZkY7AQMbnpSmPAfQbp9qAz then there'd be nothing stopping anyone in the world sending him/her coins.

By unstable, do you mean in terms of price?
I appreciate this is a circular argument, but once Bitcoin is popular it will necessarily have a much higher market cap and be less prone to price swings. It's only 5 years old - no one in their right mind would expect it to be a robust, mature, stable currency just yet.

Many of you have seen these before, but just to re-cap:
In these charts I've calculated the line of best fit through the log of price from Bitstamp. This is the middle of the yellow line. Then, I've created bands of width LN(0.3) to give each of the colours. There's nothing special about the width, other than it roughly keeps all price volatility within the rainbow.
All these charts show are the difference between the price trend and actual daily price.
The "Buy!" and "Sell!" labels are not financial advice. There is no guarantee history will repeat itself and return price back to the red of the charts.

I'd imagine what your accountant needs is the transaction record from wherever you purchased your coins from? So simply a record of how many coins you bought and the amount in fiat exchanged for them.

@_date: 2014-11-16 00:51:46

[I saw a request for an update on my rainbow charts earlier, so here you all go.](
Remember, they're not forecasting anything. All they're showing is a banding of prices within a fixed range from the trend-line - there's no guarantee we'll ever enter the red part of the rainbow again.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:25:54
We look at log scales over a one year period and linear scales for any longer period of time.
@_date: 2014-08-30 10:53:06
The chart is simply the log of price, with a line of best fit giving the "average" trend-line in yellow.
I then add in lines of equal width to give all the other colours of the rainbow either side of the average line.
Historically, buying during near the "Buy!" section is a good idea to acquire cheap coins. Similarly, one should sell during the "Sell!" section or postpone purchasing because coins are typically available at a lower price at some point in the future.
Of course, if bitcoin has reached a saturation point or is due an almighty crash from a black swan event, then this chart may not be useful as a buy/sell indicator at present. Do not buy bitcoin simply because one chart (almost) tells you to at the moment.
Note that the further forward one extrapolates this chart, the less likely the relationship will continue to hold. This chart does not predict $1,000,000 coins are on the cards.

Yep. Average daily growth rate has been updated, so the gradient is now lower than before. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 13:57:02
You are quite right, but this chart doesn't forecast the price at all! Just shows historical bounds.
@_date: 2014-11-15 09:59:49

@_date: 2014-09-19 15:02:24
Exactly, talk to the BitPay and the like - they'll help set things straight and provide a legitimate solution.
@_date: 2014-08-25 00:54:31
The best fit is based on maths, the other bands not so much.
What this chart shows is that the price of bitcoin has increased by an average of ~0.59% per day, and that at present we're below the average if we expect this pattern to continue to hold. Maybe it will, maybe it won't.
@_date: 2014-08-25 11:08:53
Good grief this has generated some interesting responses.
All the chart says is that buying in the red zone is typically unwise - if you were to wait, coins would be available at a lower price in the future.
Similarly, buying in the green area has typically been wise as the price has generally risen shortly thereafter.
The controversy, of course, is in applying this to the future. If you expect bitcoin to grow in a similar fashion then the chart suggests that now is a sensible time to buy. If you think bitcoin has capped out its potential and is unlikely to see any further growth in the future then there's never a good time to buy.
@_date: 2014-10-03 13:47:55
No conversation about stating consent through the blockchain will end in a sexual encounter, so I guess that solves the problem in a sense...
@_date: 2014-09-07 10:55:34
It's amazing to think that Bitcoin was created a mere 5 years ago - I doubt even Satoshi himself expected it to grow this rapidly in such a short space of time.
Companies such as Dell, Overstock, Expedia etc.. may only be accepting bitcoin as an intermediary to dollars, but this still represents a considerable improvement on when the primary use was for Silk Road purchases.
And now we have major players in the political sphere feeling the need to start conversations on the future of bitcoin. I know many here believe this is generally a bad thing, but consider this: they clearly don't believe bitcoin is dying, they clearly believe bitcoin has a future, and they clearly want to control it in some aspect.
Would they go through all this trouble for something with a $7b market cap? Obviously not, unless they anticipate further expansion.
If you're not optimistic about bitcoin, you're not paying attention.

Crazy large-scale dumping, with individuals continuing the trend shortly after.
The real question is why someone with so many coins is doing this, rather than dripping them onto the market, keeping price high and making more money? Entirely possible they're in a rush to sell for some unknown reason, or perhaps are manipulating the market down so as to buy back even more coins at the lower price.
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:23:42

My chart shows that buying in the red area tends to be a bad idea as there is typically an opportunity to buy at a lower price later on. I think it makes sense how that can be interpreted as over-valued in a given context.
Similarly, when the price is in the blue area it is pretty much the last chance to buy at that low price, hence under-valued. (I make no guarantees that that's the case this time around)

The MS news was great for legitimacy, sure, but ultimately it was just another way to convert coins to dollars via buying an MS product. Unlikely to be a huge positive for price.
This news is different. It's a way for big money to enter the bitcoin trading world in a US-regulated environment. And that should have a very positive impact on price.

Interesting read and it's great to hear things are going well. The beauty of your idea is that if you have a competitive edge, you'll retain a large amount of your customers and they're highly likely to recommend you further through word of mouth, so hopefully there'll be even more good news a year from now.
Also worth mentioning is that the price of bitcoin has only been declining for half of the year. For the last 6 months the price has actually been relatively stable, though still has a little way to go before it's comparable to major currencies. [For those interested, there's more details here.](
