Use of Data is from the hierarchy of
Data -&gt; Information -&gt; Knowledge-&gt; Wisdom
Via centralization of the control of Data, it is very challenging and costly to control every aspect compared to a “free market”.
It is efficient in terms of securing control over the market and the nation, meanwhile having one big honey pot for breach, hack, attack and require more man power/resources to enforce the changes.
I guess it can be efficient in some ways however, it wasn’t efficient enough to keep the reign over capitalism

I’d wait to buy at $20,000+ so I can panic sell at $5,000 and loose all my faith in BTC because all I care about is unrealistic short term returns and lambo dreams...Because I see BTC as a lottery ticket and don’t care or understand anything behind the technology and how many problems it can solve for the human race.

Unlimited is a wrong word there
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:13:21
Technically there is only certain amount of gold in the universe. Fyi, I am not against the fact that there is much more gold to be mined and would inflate the current market, probably tons more than we ever mined. I do support the fact that btc is a much harder money than gold, however the word “unlimited” is wrongfully used.
Please educate me if I am wrong.

If you have a service or product to be sold at a certain price at that day, and if you are willing to give incentives to bring more traffic to your own business, you can sell the product based on a 0% loan, that way you get your payment 100% after the term even though it gets harder and harder every day to earn that amount.
Try to see it not from a Bank's or a Loan-provider's perspective, but from a business provider's perspective. You can make your service/product much more accessible and will be getting paid the same amount like a cash deal, just over time. 
This way you can create more business, which will attract more business and at the end of the day you will be getting paid the same amount per product but generating much more business.
EXAMPLE: Think about a car dealership, instead of having the inventory over 30-60-75-90 days, they can flow it faster by creating an in-house loan for the buyers that they will get the payment over time while refreshing the inventory and generate more business.

Since BTC is deflationary ,there can be 0% or negative interest rate depending on the incentive levels. If Bitcoin achieves a steady increase after it reaches to less fluctuating medium of exchange, the loans can be paid the same amount and deflation rate can be the interest rate.
It makes perfect sense, we just need to stop thinking based on our inflationary economics and be open to a new way of THINKING. It will have an effect on everything including the human psychology. It will be about sustaining what you have, the older you get and the more patient you are with your money, the more likely you will have a set retirement. 
Instead of making money and trying to find ways for your savings to fight against inflation, it will be a patience game. A regular person will not need a substantial amount of finance knowledge or hire someone to plan their retirement with low-med risk. Back to the basics, all you need to do will be saving and HODLing.
There may be challenges that we may be able to see and that we can only see once we experience such behavioural change.
There is so much to be explored, that’s what fascinates and terrifies me at the same time.!! Buckle up everybody, we are off to an amazing adventure.

That’s why instead of having to pay the same amount, maybe a yearly reduced payment methods will be more beneficial.(Unequal yearly/monthly payments)
Basic Exmpl: A product for 3 BTC loan over 36 months;
1st year : 1,333 BTC payment broke into 12 monthly payments.
2nd year: 1 BTC payment broke into 12 monthly payments.
3rd year: 0.777 BTC payment broke into 12 monthly payments.
This can be much more complex and adjustable depending on the lender’s and purchasers’ terms. I just wanted to give the most basic example.
Ps: the reduction of the amount can be adjusted as detailed as per month.
Bigger calculations needed for a 15-25 year mortgage, however if BTC becomes stable and solid currency with somewhat calculable deflation rate, it is possible!

Check human history...it is early to see significant resistance to change due to current threat level. Eventually people who benefit from today’s banking system and centralized world will do everything to resist the change once adoption is close or arrives. 
Ps: I never meant Bitcoin supporters(including me) cause any violence in the goal of spreading the idea of financial freedom and decentralization. In fact, it is the most positive community I’ve evet been a part of.
