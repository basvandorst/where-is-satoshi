Bitcoin is community consensus. Speak up against media hype. Think for yourself.

The post is about forming a valid consensus as a community. Instead of following the crowd and forming a mob. Open discussion about the greater issues is most meaningful.

Maybe if you don't account for difficultly change and greater power costs vs rewards. As of today, the usb miners are making 0.001 / day. Covering the cost of the equipment seems out of the question unless your talking years and willing to pay more in electricity than you earn in reward. Keep in mind this assumes a btc price of 125/usd and that an unmodified usb miner will not burn out within a few years. The usb miners can get hot, like 80 C hot.

The evidence regarding the drug market place is so compelling it's hardly disputable. Yet, I wonder what other charges could be added without anyone raising a question. The nature of Bitcoin is consensus. If media is the driving factor for thought then Bitcoin is doomed.

This depends on ones hash speed. Variance can make it very difficult to calculate earnings for a single day. You must commit a long period of time to understand your earnings. The slower the hash, the worse it is. A cpu might mine for years and never get paid. Then one day a payment shows up. The same can be said for first gen asics.

It's good to have you here. Someone who represents the early majority's opinion is valuable. I think there where good people who used Silk Road. I wonder if addicts had better access to healthcare, if they would choose medication over street drugs?
