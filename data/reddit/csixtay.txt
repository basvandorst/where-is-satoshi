Pretty detailed information about Black market, ATM, bank and official exchange rates. Some of the info is crowdsourced but overall it's pretty accurate.

Nigerian here.
The popular MMM Ponzi scheme recently switched it's medium for remittances to bitcoin in a bid to counter the SEC's efforts to stop it.
Banks are under orders to stall or cancel any transactions to known MMM accounts or with MMM related descriptions.
Personally I'm a bit torn. On the plus side it shows the waning influence of government over-reach regarding how we spend our own money. On the other hand, its still just a ridiculous amount of people (estimated 3 million) getting scammed.

Great. So you won't mind if it's blocked.


I agree. Just a little oversight. So a quick fix should be rolled out quickly without opposition.


Exactly. That's why I support quickly quashing this non-issue so we can go back to focusing on what really matters. Thankfully the attack vector was discovered before anyone could use it to gain an upper hand (and undermine POW). A solution is already synthesized. It's protects all miners against any new actor willing to use AB (since Bitmain/Antpool has denied using it covertly). Surely it'll get 100% signaling in no time.
