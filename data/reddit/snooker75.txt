A) The article was articulate and had some interesting points.
B)  'The Beginning of the End' of anything is it's birth.  From there on, it's only a matter of time.   Nothing lasts for ever.   
C) Authors get a lot more clicks and page views (thus ad revenue) by predicting the worst than they do from telling people there is no panic.
Bitcoin may be flawed, and it may NOT be flawed.   What people are missing is the fact that this (pseudo) currency has ignited a passion in millions of people.  Some are in it just for the profit, some are in it for the change.   Bitcoin itself may survive, it may evolve into something completely different, and it may die off completely.   
There was great concern at the Napster revolution.  The great institutions of the day thought the appeal of Napster was the it made it easy to steal.  iTunes has proven that the brilliance of Napster was that it opened a new way for people get and listen to music.   Napster didn't kill off the music industry, it killed off CASSETTE tapes.  iTunes spelled the end of CD's.  Neither killed music.
In the same way, Bitcoin is allowing people to conduct transactions on the internet in new, and easier ways.   It's not going to kill off fiat currency.  And that's not the point of Bitcoin.   I think we have yet to really boil down what it is about Bitcoin that ignited excitement and passion in so many people, but once people have tasted it, they want more.

Formula 1 racing cars are faster than Freightliner's.   
Racing cars will never be a replacement for long haul big rigs.
