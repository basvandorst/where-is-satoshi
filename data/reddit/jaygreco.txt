Hmm. Strange. Do you have a good internet connection? If the app can't retrieve the exchange, it won't display a badge. You can also look in your notification center preferences and make sure notifications are on, particularly "Badge App Icon".

I built it a few months back for a hacky weekend project but only recently submitted it. Funnily enough, it was "In Review" for a time until right after WWDC Keynote was over.

For fun: the post I made to this sub when I first came up with the idea way back when.

Sure, background updating price alarms with push notifications would be something that could be added for sure.

Can confirm all of this info. I'd love to support older versions with my new apps, but unfortunately unless it was an app I started when 3.x or 4.x was out, I don't even have the option to.

I'm thinking I'll add an option for mBTC; it's an easy calculation.

I am going to put the code up for grabs on GitHub later today, which makes it fair game for any who have a developer account or friends that do! 
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:11:20
Cool, I hadn't even seen this!

UPDATE: Reading through the comments, I'm really excited with the response. As of right now, I've got it on GitHub.
What does this mean for end users?
If you are a registered iOS dev (and who knows, tons of you guys might be), you can fork/clone/download it exactly how it is and build it for your device. Make changes galore, I'd love this idea to be something that others can help me make awesome.
If you aren't, I'll be submitting it to the App Store for free. However, the app approvals team shuts down for the holidays, and so it would most likely release early 2014.

There's a hacky but workable way to deal with this. For anything over 10k; if the number ends with a "1", it displays the whole thing. There'd be a loss of precision of about 0.1%.

Obj-C!

Sure, that was in the plan. What I've got now has the framework to change the currency, I just haven't implemented it yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:13:04
For sure. At the time when I made the project, the App Store wasn't even on my mind. It started as more of a fun day off sort of thing.

I'm sure it would be pretty simple with Android...I just haven't taken the time to learn it yet :p but, since it'll be open source regardless of whether I choose to put it in the App Store or not, anyone will be able to see how I implemented what.
