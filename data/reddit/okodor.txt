There is plenty of profit motive if the wallet is bound to a specific service like Coinbase. Or it could even be "open" in that it could do all the things a wallet should do whether it was a Coinbase account or other Bitcoin address, but then CB could offer features not directly tied to the protocol like no fee, instant transactions to other Coinbasers, easy deposits and withdrawals from/to a bank account, etc.
The incentive would be that people would flock to CB for these services due to the quality and integration of the wallet.

There is plenty of overlap between liberal ideology and Bitcoin. The whole grassroots, buy local thing is all about giving small businesses power and unbinding ourselves from corporate servitude. That's very appealing to liberals. Most liberals I know want the same thing as libertarians: protection from corporate oligarchs. The only difference is they are willing to support the creation of those protections through government while libertarians are not.

Not sure if you're joking, but BeOS has been rebuilt for modern PCs via the Haiku Project: 
Not quite practical yet for most uses but really fun.

Haha, it's alpha. They are working on more basic things such as adding a wifi GUI interface, which I believe happened less than a year ago.

Were bitcoin to become commonly used, few people who used it would know they're using it, the same way few of the millions of iPhone users know their phone's powered by an ARM processor. You could say the same thing about Mac users and Unix or Android users and Linux.
Public opinion doesn't matter much when it comes to something that draws value from its technical capacities.

Money changes things. We saw this in fast motion with Dogecoin -- started all jokey and fun, then the currency suddenly took on some value, and the same people who thought they were in just for the lols couldn't fight the greedy feeling. Most people can't. I know I got defensive once or twice about bitcoin back when I owned more of them.

I also think people are wary of anything that promises a revolution for a couple reasons:
1) Cults spread lies about revolution to win people over.
2) If Bitcoin is for real, it means major change, which makes people nervous. They won't be the people "in the know" anymore.
Lastly, you have to ask yourself, "Is this any different from any other news article comment area?" Comments on news articles tend to be negative and cruel if the article is about anything less uplifting than like puppies saving kittens from dragons or something equally sappy.

Yahoo does do some things right. Their sports coverage is well done with some good writers. I don't know if that extends to journalism for other subjects.
