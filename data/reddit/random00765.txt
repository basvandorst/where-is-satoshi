But how are they with security and how trusty these wallets are. Or they all equal to that point (if you know) couse I don't want to have my private keys stolen from someone.

Exodus is really the best looking out there, easy to install.  Not really a big deal for backup since I can send 1DOGE to be able to do backup.
Maybe add that user can add fees (with alerting the user that this might cause his founds to not be send at all and that he might end up with losing his coins). **Bitcoin fee is 0.0009** (which can be to much if sending low amonts, we all know that sometimes it can take up some time b4 we get confirmations for sending/receiving bitcoin -  so in some cases maybe the sender want to put higher fee to be able to move bitcoins faster). For  **doge - fee is 5doge**, on most other wallets it is only 1. 
**Maybe let us to place custom themes?** 
Add in settings that we are able to change currency - **USD/EURO/YEN/YUAN ...**
Let us chose for which coins we want our adresses to be shown. For example I don't use dash and would not like it to be in my wallet (but that I am able to add it to be visable via settings if I need to in the future - coinomi has this feature and its not bad).
**Add more coins** in the future (tho I think that you are prob already working on that).
Also try to make one for ANDROID/IOS. 
Well these were my thoughts about it :)

Are you sure your mobile wasn't compromised?  Have you installed any 3rd party apps or downloaded some shady things on mobile before?

Because if you do your business right + hard work you could get much higher returns plus you will have something that will generate you money in the long run plus you will educate how to do some new things. I guess crypto trading won't last forever and it is looked at high risk investment for a reason. If you are in to make money of course
