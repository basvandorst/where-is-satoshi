 Anyone who hears about bitcoin can mine and take part. If you have a video card, you can download open-source software and mine coins. I can't imagine a more free and open way to seed the coins. Nobody can stop you from getting bitcoin; this has to be one of the most fair games out there. Compare it to the IPO of a company - see if you can take part in the initial offering of facebook.


  Deflation occurs whenever the supply of money grows slower than the supply of goods in the economy. If an economy is innovating, then goods will become easier and cheaper to produce. This causes prices to fall through competition. Loans are not as necessary because saving is rewarded. Deflation is very bad for banks because individuals will not borrow money and are more likely to default on loans they currently have.


  I can't really comment on this because I have not sold bitcoins. I have spent some and have not had a problem buying anything I wanted getting an Amazon gift card from spendbitcoins.com (no fee.)


  This is far from true. Even in the event of a terrible exploit, the software can be patched and the blockchain forked. It actually happened in [2010]( and the problem was patched. If another exploit is found, there are plans to respond quickly to fix the issue and get the new chain going. A very resilient system.

If you read this with a rational mind, you'll find the author makes no clear arguments and is just trying to scare you away from this "scam."

You should have the rent in bitcoins displayed somewhere so you see it every month, even if you don't click the "pay with bitcoin" link.
That way tenants will see the number of bitcoins going down as the price rises.
Price goes to $30 again 


"Didn't the rent cost 200 bitcoin last month?"
