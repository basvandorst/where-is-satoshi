I think we'll hear a lot more about BCC in the next few days with the scam they've pulled...
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:58:04
I've doubled his investment for him already, so he is pretty happy about it :) We are still early, only four people out of 20+ in my firm own some crypto and we are software developers. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:20:08
Of course it is. It was a blatant ponzi, that's why I wrote poor naive souls and shit coin. But I do feel sorry for people that fell for it, but if something looks to good, it probably isn't.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:42:53
BCC is Bitconnect and that's what I meant.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:06:42
My brother was saying the same thing and made fun of me when it was 4.5k and I've bought it. Few months later he tossed a nice amount of money in and is hyped about it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:38:42
Sure, one ponzi is down (BCC), hop on the next one. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:54:09
Site is down, they've announced end of operations and have returned all loans in BCC at valuation of 367$. It's worthless now, no one is buying it, it's down to 47$ in few hours. A lot of people lost A lot of money...
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:15:31
Why? They got their money back in BCC.
Poor naive souls, including my co-worker who shilled this shit to me every single week.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:04:50
Yap, I've almost doubled my BTC valuation with this tactic (as somewhat noob trader). But I don't think POWR, ADA (partly) and SUB are shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:10:01
It's a baloon, not bubble, it has deflated several times already. People are losing money by panic selling on every dip and there is your zero sum game.
But I do agree it can all go to hell at one point or another, before mass adoption. That's why I'll only keep a limited amount in Crypto and spend the rest of my profits. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:00:35
If they won't deliver I agree, that's why I wrote partly :)
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:16:24
Just gamble some more and buy BTC.

What kind of idiot takes out 500k house loan?
@_date: 2019-07-27 06:22:22
Not really, he is basing his preduction on two previous cycles, where one was in really early stages and still they look a bit different. TW was just an example.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:45:54
Green of course, what kind of question is that?
@_date: 2019-07-16 04:35:53
At least some of the other countries won't do it (Russia), USA will be left behind in development and adoption. It's a shot in the foot.
@_date: 2019-07-01 09:05:14
Facebook is banned in China. Bitcoin doesn't care if some tries to ban it, but Libra will.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:35
Sure, it's over, pack your bags everyone.
At least it's not Bitconnneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeccctttt!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:50
Do you really believe they have insurance for it?

Analyst = bullshitter
@_date: 2019-07-27 06:15:25
No, but stating number so specific is borderlining on bullshiting and every analyst draws lines differently. Just look at tradingview and tell me it's not bullshit? Out of 300 predictions one is bound to come true.
@_date: 2019-07-21 07:17:30

If you've been in this game for 9 years and still have to work for living you really are an incompetent tool or just plain dumb. Oh, where are my downvote bots...
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:26:16
Funny thing, they trust institution like Facebook with clear history of abusing client personal data and not the decentralized network of math and IT geeks?
@_date: 2019-07-01 09:09:40
Aren't we close to the maximum we can get from current architecture? Where did you get 10x?
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:41:40
Never? Really?
Ask shop owners how they like credit card fees. Oh, consumers are paying 3-5% bank fee, so everything is ok.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:31:59
Why is that Bitcoin still at 21 mio needed? Who cares about a Tether shitcoin and how could it change the amount of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-01 09:16:02
Sure. But try to educate yourself just a little before trying to be a smartass.
@_date: 2019-07-01 09:05:46
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:45:42
So now you will have to watch less porn?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:05:38
I'll do the same, it will be a paper wallet in a nice gift card. Private key will be covered to prevent any thefts.
I'm glad you also have smart friends :)
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:25:13
Or get that 0.1 BTC less. So many people missed the train at 4k, because "it's going to 2k"...
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:04:05
Don't feed the (bad) troll.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:44:25
Maybe you should learn some manners and consider that not everyone is a native speaker. How well do you speak Spanish, German or French?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:31:04
I do too, but I just wanted more opinions. So far it's looking a solid idea and I'm glad you also think so :)
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:09:52
Who said it's never going below 10k again?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:21:35
I bought 4 months ago at 4500 and people told me I was stupid. Now they are asking me how is my Bitcoin and what it really is.
@_date: 2018-09-15 07:56:08
Really, cool? Small blockchain text with weird font is cool?
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:57:20
Erm, it was a joke? Damn son...
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:13:06
I'll try to be a little more helpful. Reduce the camera movement or increase zoom, it's kinda hard to follow with constant jumping around. Maybe increase the size or change font (it looks different than the rest?) for main price, so it's easier to read.
But this is just my opinion and you know opinions are like assholes :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:28:16
You madman actually watched it? Damn...
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:35:30
I've bought at 4500 and it crashed to 3000 soon after that. Now I just wish I've bought a full coin and not only a quarter.
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:29:28
The reason I invested in Bitcoin is because I don't trust bank more than I need to. Why would I give them my private keys?
@_date: 2018-09-20 06:32:25
Real estate? I will live in Bitcoin house?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:33:38
Agreed, I got from 0.45BTC to 0.7BTC  just by investing into alts. Still a long way to full BTC :(
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:47:26
Is this Google translated?
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:59:08
I understand it, I'm talking about majority of people that don't have CS degree :) 
But I do wish you all the best with it, since you are at least doing something creative.
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:56:55
You underestimate general laziness and stupidity. Trust me, I've done enough software projects and worked with quite a lot of people, most of them were both.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:03:23
Yes. He is one of my best friends and I've known him for 17 years now. I have enough invested for myself and it makes no difference to me.
@_date: 2018-09-15 14:41:16
Or you might die unexpectedly and all your funds will be lost forever, unreachable to your loved ones...
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:47:11
I was always a bit different, so nothing new there :)
 They are definitely interested, we've talked about BTC a lot three weeks ago, which gave me the idea. I'll buy it off them, if they decide to sell :) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:07:16
I think we've had enough cutting things off yesterday... I'm still sick even thinking about it and haven't even watched that wretched video.
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:30:04
He had ledger, but for some reason imported into Electrum.
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:59:24
Sure, but a warning is still necessary.
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:32:40
And 6400 on tuesday :) Up and down, up and down, kinda repetitive right now...
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:34:18
Lol, it looked weird :) I don't venture into dark reddit :D
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:32:17
I wish something like that will happen with my present..
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:56:46
Thanks! But I'll probably spend at least a part of it checking Blockfolio :))
@_date: 2018-09-28 08:20:32
Grammar mistakes are intentional?
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:36:31
I want the second part more than becoming rich. I'm just concerned about even more price manipulation than there is right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:22:31
Apparently it's true. I haven't watched and I won't. But here is the link:
[He's got ball(s)](
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:46:15
Old news is so exciting.. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:51:57
You do realize developers have to write the automated check suite? If they have put that comment in, then there is no need or probably even means to test it, since there is no code for it.
It was collective oversight.
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:22:33
Or they might go to 0 with higher probablity than Bitcoin. Check GAT.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:53:25
Some gut said he will cut of his left ball and eat, it if Bitcoin hits 10k in 2017. Well, he delivered...
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:54:50
Or even faster to 0
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:31:27
Much better :) Just one question, where can I see current buy/sell order price that is set by buttons? I'm on a phone, so it would probably be obvious on a larger screen...
@_date: 2018-09-20 07:59:08
And nothing about rising 400$ in minutes.
@_date: 2018-09-27 10:34:49
There can't realistically be a x100 gain, it's not FED controlled after all :)
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:25:55
It's an option, but do you believe it will stay there?
@_date: 2018-09-20 06:29:45
He is probably a kid, what does he know about owning a house, buying a car, ...
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:49:43
Sorry, but if you need a video to explain it, then it's not a good UI. And I don't mean to be rude.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:54:44
Original comment makes sense and I agree with it, it absolutely should check for it, since it's one of the biggest problems of blockchain and practically any transaction. He/she just wrote it like automated test suite should find bugs like this automatically. What I've stated is just that someone first has to write a test for automated test suite.
p.s. I don't know what Bitcoin developers are using, just my observation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:02:21
Sure :D Now I'm happy everytime I woke up and see new ATH. But it was hard watching prices plummet back then... I still expect a healthy correction when futures really start.
@_date: 2018-09-14 10:07:24
Or we are borderline lunatics :)
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:14:18
No, to the mooooon :) 
Seriouy, is anyone really expecting it to go past 7k?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:26:00
I guess all of them, since it was faked.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:32:29
Yes, but if the check is removed from the code, then automated test fails (if it's there). You can't just change it in one place. Believe me, I get a headache every time I have to change automated tests. :)
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:25:44
And how was is/he wrong? It's hard to use, hardly accepted in stores, etc. It will change, but adoption is a slow process.
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:20:02
1. How much is average salary in Venezuela? Info I found was very outdated.
2. Are schools functioning normally?
3. Are any of your friends or family migrating from Venezuela? 
4. Can you post your BTC address, I don't want to send to a wrong person. :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 09:11:38
No, shiny gold plates are still too nice to own, I really want few. Gold also has a lot of different use cases and it's not going anywhere.
@_date: 2018-09-15 06:21:09
Sure, Petro is doing great.
@_date: 2018-09-25 20:57:01

@_date: 2018-09-23 15:36:47
Yes, I use Ledger for everything, well worth the price. And I don't even have much money in crypto.
Edit: I see now, that OP didn't have ledger with him. It should be a good lesson to all of us...
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:54:06
As long as they don't rise faster than Bitcoin, he is fine. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 06:08:46
Wow, this really is bad... I would say how could the government let this happen, but we all know the answer is greed. People in my country should be grateful for what we have, not constantly complain about everything. I am really glad you have posted this video, it's an inspiration to us all how Bitcoin can do good. But it would be even better if there was no need for such videos and use of Bitcoin.
I hope you are able to finish school and live a good life!
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:18:56
Oh well, my buy order went trough. On to next salary and buying opportunity, :)
@_date: 2018-09-25 20:54:28
Good, now new cycle can begin.
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:08:04
Dsmn, I nearly cut myself, it was so sharp...
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:09:24
Ledger would look realy nice, but I'd only do it if they'd already have some crypto. It would be a waste of money for amount I'm giving them (we don't give really expensive gifts between friends). But thanks for the idea!
@_date: 2018-09-23 08:09:10
I kinda agree with you. USD actually was backed by gold, but with deregulation that allowed banks to practically gamble with that money, it's not anymore.
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:01:39
Surely you can afford more than 2 cents with this growth...
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:43:37
And maybe he could have got shot instead (hypothetical of course). It can go both ways.
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:24:08
Soo, bull run starting?

@_date: 2018-09-25 16:45:08
Agreed. If majority of Bitcoin is bought by filthy rich investors, that got rich with exploiting traditional banking system, we haven't changed shit.
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:49:04

Don't you want to accumulate first? 
Also, try to think past your gains.
@_date: 2018-10-20 17:05:02
Stop thinking about you situation where you have perfect access to banks and multiple payment systems. Think of other people that don't have valid papers, live in underdeveloped corrupt countries that don't allow or have banks, etc. Also you don't see a problem with banking hours that close in friday after 2 or 3 pm?
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:48:41
Sure, but I've also sent some to a guy in Venezuela to see how it works :)
@_date: 2018-10-31 07:38:00
9 months actually.
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:22:03
Diversification is key in my opinion. Having balanced portfolio makes you less susceptible to any unwelcome events. But I guess most people here are Bitcoin maximalists that will shit on gold and stocks.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:54:36
You really have balls of steel. But I do hope you'll get rewarded with a million :P

@_date: 2017-08-31 16:48:40
Haha, I bet you are feeling like a champ :) I believe it will really rise and plan to add to my investment. I just have to keep that a secret from my wife...
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:49:20
I'm joining now, but it's still better than never. Crypto is still in diapers...
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:28:46
It's changing very very fast, I had to find that sweet spot and almost missed it (price went up 20€ in a minute...). Don't worry, it will rise :P 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:37:31
No idea, try not to do it too much, you could get a silly idea... 
I'm transferring bitcoin to a paper wallet and then to a wall safe :))
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:43:29
Basically you put your coins into a wallet that only exists on a paper and therefore can't be hacked. :) When you need money you scan your primary key and transfer crypto. But make sure you create a few copies and keep it in a safe place. But with 50 quid your are probably safe enough in an online wallet...
It would be best if experienced traders give their opinion, they are very helpful in BitcoinBegginers subreddit.
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:15:52
Not just women...
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:06:29
Well, I see it rising a lot when general public get in. Even some of my fellow computer engineers have no idea what bitcoin is...
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:34:50
And that's why you shouldn't do drugs!
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:38:01
Damn and I've bought it at 3780€ two days ago :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:04:49
I've bought 900€ or better 0.23782213 at the recent dip for the first time ever too. It will probably go lower before rising, but I'm just hodling for few years and adding every month. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:26:51
When your 15k rise 300 percent who will be crazy? And probably a lot after that :) But a 40k loan WOULD be crazy...
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:43:58
If she'll have few bitcoins stashed I'm more than happy with her secrets :) 
This is my retirement plan and it would be really nice to surprise her in 35 years with a nice sum of money to spend together. 1/10 of my salary will probably go to crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:57:41
I actally got in with a buy order on a price crash like that, it was nice.
@_date: 2019-08-29 09:03:47
This is what people are missing.
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:40:42
Basic human emotion, it's hard to believe in something that has lost 80+ of it's value. This is also why most people lose money in the markets. They buy when it's 150% up, but they won't buy more when it's 50% down, but will sell what they have bought.
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:33:17
Buy BTC at ATM with cash, buy drugs, die.
@_date: 2019-10-07 08:28:20
Erm, the rates are getting lower and lower and we will see negative soon. Do you really thing this money printing will work forever? It can't.
@_date: 2019-10-21 05:01:21
Maybe he grew another dick...
@_date: 2019-10-26 14:16:11
100 000x18 000 000?
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:12:27
Plummeting would be from 11.200 to 9.000. This is just a toddler's hiccup.
@_date: 2019-10-05 05:59:13
I hope BTC at least doubles so he will be able to pay the maintenance cost of that Alfa...
@_date: 2019-10-07 08:54:59
I think this already is more than most of us expected. But yeah, they are doing amazing job at doing a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:13:20
A time lapse from the near future.
@_date: 2019-08-29 09:01:59
Sell the rumor, sell the news.
@_date: 2019-10-26 14:46:44
Yes and I have no doubt we will hit it in few (3?) years, but what he posted is borderline insane.
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:08:28
It's not an investment.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:13:28
No, but allowing people few minutes of break during work usually increases productivity.

Love seeing Bitmex rekt Liquidated short Beyond godlike x61.
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:29:30
Sorry, but you are delusional. Make a simple calculation how big crypto would have to be for even 100k and how far adoption is right now.

You really think people buy bitcoin with the money they need for food? Lol...

It is impractical. Otherwise I like gold.

Ah ok, then I probably would give you some money :))

Buying from 6.5k to 3.4k. Too risky otherwise.

As a developer myself I trust no exchange in the world.
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:47:08
Maybe you should have asked for 5k and then 2k.  No sane person would say yes to your proposal.
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:36:53
I know you are joking. But most people don't understand you won't get a lambo with crypto anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:40:53
I only have to pay SEPA fee which is 0.4€ for me for each transaction to Bitstamp. Otherwise I would use it for sure.

Simple things as tax enforcement. Now we know what this is all about...
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:18:25
I really think 3k was support. It crashed way down from 5k and rebounded at 3k again.

@_date: 2019-06-28 07:30:24
Or they are just not gamblers. Sure, this is probably opportunity of our lifetimes and we won't get another chance. But most people are risk averse and refuse to put money into something they are not sure it will work. This is also why most of them will buy at the top and lose money then. Nobody I know was buying at 3-4k, but they would be open to it now when it's too late.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:17:20
The post I've been replying too isn't exactly humble too and I wrote it more as a jest even though it's true :) I never tell that to anyone in real life, I'm a humble person and never act condescendingly.

No, please god no. Cut off ball was enough for a lifetime.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:47:05
Of course, I meant it more as if you don't have enough money saved to weather a few months without pay, then you shouldn't put money in risky investments. A lot of people that do that are irresponsible and that is one of the reasons they don't have more.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:43:10

From 325$ to 1324$ in last 15 years. Not Bitcoin, but for a stable long term investment this is good.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:40:58
But but, it's going to 1k...
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:33:26
Bitstamp and use SEPA, I'm paying 0.4€ bank transfer fee for deposit. But they are getting annoying with all the KYC shit, I'm still declining their last attempt. They want to know my salary, my other crypto accounts, etc. Why would I give them that?
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:42:23
Or not give a fuck with investing what it can easily be missed. But it's hard to put in serious money when price is lower every week...
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:21:39
I'm very lucky I have the same bank as Bitstamp. Funds are usually on next day following SEPA transfer. But I can't imagine how frustrating your experience must be...
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:29:15
I've posted two more buy orders two days ago at 6300 and 6050. I guess I screwed up and predicted dip badly :(

@_date: 2017-11-08 14:32:45
Wrong. My life savings are tied up in my new house and I'm only 32. I rarely spend anyhing that isn't necessary. 10% will go to gold as soon as I buy a good safe. Wife isn't really happy with crypto, as most people aren't.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:03:23
Savings for my first investment few months ago. Not much yet really, less then 1/3 of BTC. But it will be more, since I'm putting 10% of my monthly income into crypto.

Or...wait for it... exchange gets hacked and you are really and trully fuxked.

I understand, but there is also the fact that more cryptocurrencies will be created and used that will eat a part of a marketcap. Thinking that only Bitcoin will come out of the whole new technology era is laughable. Market cap of whole cryptocurrencies to got to 21 trillion? Sure, I don't see a reason against it.
And stop with the patronizing, you are not as smart as you think.

You believe more now, because the price is now x2.5.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:58:00
Why are people always waiting for perfect bottom, then when it's up 60% ask when is the next dip?
@_date: 2019-04-05 04:45:46
But you weren't smart enough not to do dumb shit and buy at all time high, right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:55:39
When you have a choice of going to casino or watching it burn before your eyes, the choice is easy. You really should read more about their situation, before giving smart ass comments.

Never trust strangers of internet. Also, don't try to trade Bitcoin with their advice.

Great work!!
I've bought at 4500$ and my brother said it will crash hard and he will buy at 2000$. I'm taunting him after every 1 or 2k increase in price when will he buy :D
@_date: 2019-04-14 07:42:03
Because the market cap of just Bitcoin would have to be ~21 trillion. Gold has 7 or 8 trillion.
@_date: 2019-04-14 09:59:24
21 marketcap for all crypto, not just Bitcoin is achievable IF there will be more uses that we aren't even implementing or thinking seriously right now (micropayments for taximeters, streaming billing, lectures, ...). For just Bitcoin the marketcap of gold? I can also see that. So I guess we are only few trillions apart :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:34:42

At least there are more it's a scam and it's going to zero posts now. But I still don't think this is bottom. No one wants it now...
But if they think that, then they were wrong to buy it in the first place.

Sure, from monday to friday from 8am to 6pm or something like that.  Really amazing, if not using swift it can even get processed on the same day.
I still think we are going lower...

Sell something that has dropped 35% and buy something that has gone up 25% looks like sell low, buy high for me. It only makes sense if you believe BTC is trully done.

@_date: 2017-09-04 19:31:27
I am new to crypto, but I've done my research (read a lot, watched youtube tips, studied price fluctuations). First trade I've bought on a dip for ~250$ cheaper last week and more now with this "omg crash". People just getting in for a quick buck really should put money in a cushion. I will make mistakes, but it won't be out of ignorance :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:43:18
No one is selling. We may be stupid to buy, but we aren't stupid enough to sell now... But I get perfectly why "invest only what you can afford to lose". I probably wouldn't be able to hodl if my living room/kitchen/bedroom were disappering by the minute.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:30:37
I hope he is banging his head now :D At least now she knows what bitcoin is. But with recent drop she will probably start calling it shitcoins :)

I agree with you. That's why there are so many bad developers out there, that outright shame everyone in the business. Everyone can start hacking, but quality of their work is abysmal and most people don't have that logic and analytical thinking that is necessary in the field.

Yes, I'm still up, but next time I gain x5 or x10 on a coin I'm selling at least half, put some in ETH/BTC, some in promising alts and convert the rest back in fiat to buy something useful. I guess this is a nice lesson to learn, just a very painful one.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:47:34
Bought at dip at 4450, bought some more at dip to 4100 or so, bought some more at 3700. Now I feel like a complete idiot. But at least I admit it :)

He has absolutely no intention of buying when it's down. :) It won't work here, try somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:33:54
This is for ICO's and other potential fast gaining coins. It's not for every coin I own. But you are right, I should take my profits sooner :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:41:15
Because what people read is you can't buy crypto with fiat anymore.

You can still take your gold and sell it to another person for food, shelter, clothes, etc. If Bitcoin's network is down and transaction can't be confirmed, it IS worthless.

@_date: 2019-05-31 06:15:46
Probably will sell a half when everyone will start asking me how to buy bitcoin. The rest probably at 150k, since there won't be too much room to grow anyway (possible x3 is not worth the risk after that)
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:18:16
And at 4k they thought we will go to 2k and all is doomed, at 20k they thiught we will go to 100k. Better sell everything now.
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:27:55
You trust open source community to code Bitcoin. So what are you implying?
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:36:27
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:28:51
At some stores you get BTC discount. I think it will get more traction with adoption. And no, bubble to 20k was not a part of adoption.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:49:47
