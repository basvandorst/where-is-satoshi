What does this have to do with Bitcoin?

You could also use [links]( to move the entire AppData directory or just the Bitcoin directory.

The Sailfish software is not open source.

Have you asked them? Posting passive aggressive posts on reddit about it isn't going to do anything.

Using the same logic, "Windows can be made immune". But none of what you mention is provided by Linux distributions today in any practical manner.

What information and access would that be, exactly?

OK, so let's assume that you make this sort of investment using Bitcoin. Those coins are still at the hands of a third party (e. g. the evil bank that handles the investment fund). Evil government decides to retroactively tax that equity and the bank is every bit as obligated to tax your bitcoins you've already conveniently placed in their possession. How would this be any different?

No, it simply does not, and yes, it is very possible. An investment fund requires you to place your currency (be it euros or Bitcoins) in the hands of others. Just like your euros aren't in *your* bank account with a fund your Bitcoins wouldn't be in *your* wallet. As long as this fund operates legally the operator (= bank) needs to pay the taxes. Nothing would change and this thread is nothing but a stupid circlejerk.

No, but a debit card allows you to make the same online payments 99% of the time.

I would also like to earn bitcoins by sitting home, masturbating and playing CS:GO, but alas, I really don't think it's going to happen.
Realistically this is probably an attempt to cash in with ad revenue or maybe phish people who reuse passwords.
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:35:04
Huh, what? Both Visa and MasterCard have debit cards that work perfectly fine online. Where do you live?

It's another way to waste your money.

Yeah, it's not like Freetype has had [20 CVE's this year so far]( or anything.

No matter if it's dealing in Bitcoin, dollars or bottle caps, it's never "free". From a technical standpoint, it's another integration that has to be maintained and tested with the payment system as it changes. And from a legal standpoint, it's another source of income to be accounted for in bookkeeping and taxes.

Because I won't need any forfeitable assets like a house or a car when I have Bitcoin. What the fuck are you smoking, OP? Stop posting this offtopic here, please.

Can I have my turn to post this tomorrow?
