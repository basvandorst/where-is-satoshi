I figured as much. Everything that I have read and experienced pointed to gold being a good/great conductor.
I think the trolls are out.

One million years? I heard it was a less than 200,000.

Just curious, do you feel this way about ebay?

How do you explain the rotation of Jupiter and it's moons when you can look at it with your own eyes (with a telescope)? Why do moons suddenly appear from behind the disc (that magically happens to be directly pointed at us at perpendicular angle)?
How does a photon of light "stop" if the sun is always orbiting this disc of Earth? Roughly half of the Earth is always illuminated. Why does the disc only get half of the photons? What is the speed of light in this world flat Earth? Does light have a max distance it is allowed to travel?
Can you explain why everyone cannot see Mount Everest all the time if they looked in that general direction.
Can you explain how the moon goes through its lunar phases? Why isn't it always illuminated or never illuminated based off its position relative to the sun?
Where does the sun get it's energy?
Can someone on this flat Earth in the United States shoot a laser directly to someone in China since line of sight is granted?
