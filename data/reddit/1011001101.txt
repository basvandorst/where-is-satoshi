I use armory as my wallet... so [this]( is how i did it.  To be perfectly honest I'm still learning how this all works myself.

So let me get this straight... we need government regulation because nobody reads the fine print?  It's too complicated for the layperson to understand?  The real kicker is that you sign documents without understanding them.  Even to just rent a car that's a way to get burned.  There should be no faith in any legal transaction, if you are unable to understand what you are getting into hire a lawyer... they have institutionalized explaining transactions and contracts to the layperson.
edit: Came off snarky, was not my intention.  Won't edit the original post because others might have seen it.

How could you even try to mix that many coins?  That's a huge amount.

Fucking love dune.
    I must not fear.
    Fear is the mind-killer.
    Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
    I will face my fear.
    I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
    And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
    Only I will remain.

record player works fine.. just some cosmetic damage.  Little dent on one of the built in speakers.

agreed, I bought a record player from them that was damaged in shipment.  They told me to keep it and sent another for no charge.  Love overstock.

Well shit, of course it's one sided... Gox hasn't said anything.  I thought that was the problem (besides the cessation of trades and the site going down), it's all speculation until someone will go on the record.  Speculation on my part is Gox could end all of this with a clear statement, which not only hasn't happened but has been actively avoided.
Edit: added a comma, probably in the wrong place.
