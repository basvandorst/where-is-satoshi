It jumped then buying/selling was suspended. I don’t think it’s actually being sold at that price. But we’ll see once they turn it back on.

What’s wrong with Coinbase? 
We knew this was going to happen, hopefully those of us with a little BTC in there at the work can get some money for our BitcoinTrash.

Just wish I could have sold my BCC when it glitched to $8k.

This article is seven months old and a repost, but I just read it for the first time and found it really helpful.
**The Tulip Bubble**
1. The Tulip Bubble story is almost certainly myth
2. Even during the height of the tulip bubble, tulip futures were really low
3. The speculation was driven by options which were relatively cheap and had high potential upside
4. The futures market accurately predicted the "crash"
5. The bubble was speculative and appears rational
**How this relates to crypto**
1. [Future markets have bitcoin growing]( though not to the moon just yet
2. This could be a normal bubble, but this isn't a tulip bubble

That's a good point. 
There are real reasons to be skeptical of Bitcoin, but I think the Tulip story is one of the worst arguments against Bitcoin. It isn't based in reality, Bitcoin =/= tulips, Bitcoin has utility, and as you said tulips still have a non-zero value.

Well, was it good?

I can’t help but tell mine each time we hit an all time high or something like 2x happens (or doesn’t).

In the US a short term capitol gain is treated as income. So you’d only pay 32% if you made more than $157k in a year.

Lots of us (newer subs at least) probably couldn't have bought in without Coinbase. But it's kinda cool to rip them to show we know of better methods.
If you know exactly what you're doing then there are much better ways than a coinbase, but since I don't I'm a fan.
