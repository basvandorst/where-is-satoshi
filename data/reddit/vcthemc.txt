No. As a rule never store your bitcoins in an exchange. They can be seized. You'll want an exchange account and when you buy bitcoin you'll want to send them to a secondary wallet either in the form of a hardware wallet, cold storage wallets, or just an independent wallet like breadwallet.

that's fine man people can do what they want I don't care lol bitcoin is a currency I don't really care if it scales or not because myself and some of my friends still use it as a currency (alongside fiat) I just like to convert when the rate is lower. as of now this is the lowest it's been in weeks so I'm buying coins

what's the point in that? why use paypal to send bitcoin when you could send bitcoin without paypal... unless this is them integrating bitcoin for online merchants so customers can pay bitcoin and the merchant gets fiat?

I'm in my early 20's two years ago I was still in school and didn't have the money I do now to put into bitcoin

Price = problem with core? you're and idiot. there's absolutely a problem with core but it has nothing to do with the price. the drop in price is because a bunch of pussywillows heard mike hearn say "bitcoin is dead" and they all went "oh noez bitcoin is dead I am the sad" and started selling off. it'll come back up give it a few days.
