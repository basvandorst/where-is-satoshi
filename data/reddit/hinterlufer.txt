Yes. It's depending on the size of the transaction which mainly depends on how many addresses are sent from (usually it's one). The amount of BTC does not affect the transaction fee.
(that's only true for on-chain transactions of course)

5 $ he's gonna make eyes when he realizes transaction fee is like 50 % of that

as long it's an on chain transaction it is.

The thing with any transaction that is not on chain is, that you have to trust a company to keep your money. We saw what happened to mtGox which was the biggest player once until it got hacked and went bankrupt. People that were holding BTC on there lost most if not all of it.
While the whole point of BTC and cryptocurrencies in general is that it's supposed to be a trustless system, BTCs Blockchain can't handle the amount of transactions necessary needed for 100% on chain transactions which is also why transactions are so damn expensive by now and off chain transactions are needed.

Do you get them in your account on the poker website or into your BTC wallet?
If it's 1. then you don't really own the BTC, the website just says that you have a balance of said BTC like a bank - unless they pay you out you don't "really" have them.
If it's 2nd check the transaction hash / ID of one payment on any BTC block explorer. There you can find the transaction size, how much BTC/byte was paid as fee and the total fee paid for that transaction. The fee is paid from the sender - if you send like 100 mBTC, the receiver will only get about 99-99.5 mBTC - the missing BTC is paid to the network as a fee which is collected by the miner of the block.
