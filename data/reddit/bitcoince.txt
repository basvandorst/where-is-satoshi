Gotta love democracies. South Korean citizens are showing who is boss when it comes to crypto bans. Other governments are watching this. The genie is out of the bottle and is not going back in.

Stayed in bitcoin to change the world.

He is expressing frustration that his company has so much money locked in wallets that cannot be moved because the transaction fees are more than the wallet balance. The frustration is compounded greatly because the cause is bad engineering by his own company. 
As for bitcoin growth and being worried, look at layer 2 solutions - lightning network for example. All blockchain coins cannot scale to cover every transaction in the future. Layer 2 is required. Bitcoin has L2 solutions like lightning network and others going live now and over the next few months. This brings instant and almost free transactions at scale.

**Armstrong flat out said Roger Ver is better and that he (Brian) has moved to **

He has and he should leave CB and cement his reputation and legacy as a visionary and one of the most impact people in the early days of crypto. 
His recently published paper ( that covers the potential of crypto kitties shows where his focus is and what his future could be.

Call coinbase and make your voice heard and lets get them to act.

He has shown poor judgment is endorsing a viewpoint like the one in that tweet. He has done this repeatedly and made it appear he is aligned with Ver, and Ver has stated his intentions to destroy btc.
Brian should save his reputation - which will be massive and historical - by getting out of CB now and letting someone else take it to the next levels.
Brian has shown a desire (in his recently published paper that he is really proud of) to make things like crypto kitties as good as they can be. And he has the talent to take crypto kitties to the next level.

Your hope is true - you are wrong :)
The flexibility of building on L2 (and beyond) allows for more control over and evolution of user experiences, to make them progressively more awesome and seamless as related technologies and desired user experiences evolve.

Armstrong is venting his frustration because Coinbase has millions of $$ (perhaps billions?) worth of BTC stuck in their wallets, due to their bad engineering:
But to publicly like that tweet? Breathtaking incompetence. He must be out soon.
I wasn't one to really feel like leaving coinbase, but I am now. I'll use Gemini. Not gonna be a customer of a company who's CEO wants to seed the demise of BTC. Unbelievable.

Do you need access to the btc to spend? If not, a paper wallet would be best and costs nothing.

anytime time you sell for profit it has to be counted. It does not matter if you held it for only a split second or never withdraw it. Any sale is a taxable event, and if it is 
a gain, it is taxable income.

on a cold machine not connected to and never connected to the internet, use a copy of this site  by downloading it from their linked github. Copy that to cold machine via usb drive.
Generate an address and pk on cold machine.
Not needed but for extra comfort, open the pk in several windows wallets on the cold machine, to make sure all see the wallet as a valid one.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:12:48
If not coinbase, it is a hardware or paper wallet. Won't use any wallet that stores private keys on a pc.

For one, you don't have to move and if you have friends, family, culture and such, you can keep enjoying it.
For two, if you benefited from other people paying taxes and you earned money while under the same laws they are under, there is a moral obligation. 
But if neither of the above are true, Cayman Islands are a popular choice and other places around there.

Third party seller adds risk I am not comfortable with.
I bought a Trezor through an amazon reseller. It came with no factory seal. I followed all the recommended steps and hooked it up to the chrome wallet and also opened the device and visually inspected and compared to their pictures to look for non-standard chips. 
Everything checked out as ok, and I still can't bring myself to use it.

Once a trickle of movement from gold to btc starts and the price of gold does a little wobble because of it, the flood gates will open. This will occur in 2018 imo.
Will be a epochal transfer of storage of wealth, from gold that has been used for millenia, to bitcoin.

Using Coinbase/GDAX but I will be switching to a paper wallet once BTC gets up into the teens and I no longer feel the need to be able to quickly sell.

I prefer paper wallet over hardware so I don't have to worry about bugs or hacks hitting 3rd party hardware &amp; software.

Thanks, and congrats to you as well.
I downloaded the blockchain on my home desktop pc and then copied it to the drive on my Raspberry Pi node. The guide I linked to discusses this. It ended up being quicker but did involve additional steps.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:43:14
My home isp also does not offer static IPs at low cost. The permanent home for my node is in a rack at a data center. I did find some low cost options for that.

OP you are a hero. In the first class of Bitcoin heroes.
One thought for future giving \- a fund that somehow helps people to start and run their own BTC nodes. Not sure how that would work but as you know I'm sure, nothing is better for Bitcoin than more independent nodes.
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:04:43
The install steps took me the better part of a day, but I was learning along the way and moving methodically. Now I could do it again in an hour or so.
But the step of downloading and validating the existing Bitcoin blockchain is a one\-time step that took about 2 days. There is no effort involved in it \- just fire up Bitcoin Core and let it run until it has the full blockchain \- but it takes a while to complete.

Not had any issues. The "deposit" from to gdax from my cb wallets is always just a few seconds.
Did the deposit occur the other day while load was crashing coinbase?

Yes. The data center is currently hosting a large number of ASICS at those rates. And we have just added capacity for a lot more. I posted some more details in subreddits for advertising.

Agreed and I think they both will be using it, and possibly before the end of the year. Organizations that process payments will want to and will have to use the fastest and cheapest payment method in order to keep up with the competition.

F wikileaks \(or at least the self\-serving Assange\). Bitcoin doesn't need him or to be associated with him.
But boycotting Coinbase, I'll happily join that.
