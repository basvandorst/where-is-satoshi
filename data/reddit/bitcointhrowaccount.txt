hi, Dark Wallet doesn't actually create the transaction for very long. It's just hangs and then the coins end up back in the wallet.
Here is one I have just done now for 0.35 from Dark Wallet to my Eletrum 
Transaction fe4dba319c57361d39d38519c349e772dba86a7badf57a338682fad97abc65f3
Within approximately 30 minutes, this will no longer show as pending and the Dark Wallet balance will be back to the original balance

Yeah sorry I did a straight "Print to PDF"
Here is the print screen instead

Fantastic reply. Yes I managed to recover my Bitcoins doing exactly what you suggested. For anyone else who is in the same situation, here is what I did:
In Dark Wallet:
Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Key management &gt; Export private keys
I then copied this to Microsoft Notepad.
Then I went to blockchain.info and created a quick wallet (no email required) and then did as follows:
Wallet Home &gt; Import / Export &gt; (click I understand) &gt; Import Private Key
Then I manually cut n' pasted each private key from Notepad into this box and selected "Sweep keys". Eventually I hit the jackpot and got my Bitcoins back. Then I transferred this to Electrum. Here is the ID for the transaction 23a7b01879cb5af2f60e403e1fec081506d35ceb5727255d54741e53a335cab9 and 85cae77521e3dfd20352cd6b7ec27bbeddbc0b6b63859fcccd31803054dae27b
I would like to thank you by sending you 10% of the Bitcoins recovered. You can either reply with your public address here, or send me a message. Alternatively, I can donate this to any charity or organization of your choosing which accepts Bitcoins. Please let me know how you wish to proceed
Thank you

Yes thanks for the info
I have had a look at cahilla, the major difference it that bit bill  doesn't request ID and proof of address like cashila
But thanks for the information

DON'T use Dark Wallet until their customer service improves
I nearly lost 0.5 BTC but luckily a fellow redditor helped me out 
Dark Wallet's customer service was non existent, despite numerous attempts to contact them in the lobby and on IRC chat
Avoid until they get better.
