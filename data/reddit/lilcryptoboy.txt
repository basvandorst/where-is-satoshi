Whoever wrote the article should fix their double negative:
"Reading that quote it’s impossible not to grin ear to ear as feelings of tremendous superiority wash over you. What an idiot! Who didn’t see the Internet coming?
Answer: Almost nobody.
Hindsight is 20/20."
I find it hard to take an article seriously if it they didn't proof-read.
Edit: Finished the article. Nice summation of what a good mentality on crypto should be and what the possible future would look like.

Yep, technology doesn't have the ability to improve at all. Don't even bother buying until bitcoin proves itself yet again, and then buy at the ATH. Solid.

It's a shame people are so uneducated on the subject that they completely dismiss it. Don't stop trying though, like all things, it is not understood by the masses until it is.

I would say your option is to either create an account on an exchange like coinbase so you can exchange your btc for usd, or don't sell and hold onto it.
If you don't plan on spending $100 for awhile, it'd be better to just keep it safe and wait to see what happens in a year.

More like ready to make their investments. Virtually no western institutional money is involved with bitcoin atm.

 You realize he followed the path of his father, right? His dad taught him everything he knew. He deserves all the credit he is given, but even he won't deny he was in the right place at the right time.

 If you were born in a time where the stock market was the newest innovation and you invested $20, so would you.

I respect your opinion but bitcoin is now currently in a position it's never been in before, thus using previous years as a guide just doesn't work imo. 2018 is the very first year that started with bitcoin being a household name. I know my opinion is very FOMO-y, but I feel very certain bitcoin is reaching $20,000 by the end of the year (at the least).

Dude, dot-com was the 80s-90s. I'm talking about the 1940's. Why so hostile?
