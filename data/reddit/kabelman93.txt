Beautiful attitude

Yes but we did need 3 years of discussing to get from 6 to 12 transactions per second. 
A worlds currency would need around 300.000/s. It's not a currency, but a store of value and I am fine with that. But all these people who probably can't even read the code (I am a developer myself) talk about how it can be everything. It does not have to be everything, it can be enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:13:57
You can already buy everything with btc if you got a tenx card
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:12:59
14 000 was worth maybe 10$ at 2010. At the current price that's true, but we should be independent to the dollar price. Read the whitepaper, this may help you understand the system more.

I was able to send my btc in 30 min today without fees from gdax(they pay it), no idea what you guys talk about
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:37:58
The end should be: BUY!! when they start fighting.

This is a feminazi post though

The quote "I worked my ass of 5h a day 4 days a week" proves my point. With 13 I had my first job at a factory working 6 days a week 10 hours a day to finance a computer network I wanted to run my code on. 
4 days a week? 5 hours? "Working my ass off" ... Yes sorry but that's by all means a brad. No insult. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:37:23
The 2x was about control. If you look back it was about the idea of having consistent decentral nodes in the future. Also the mining hardware from bitmain can't abuse segwit as much with the patented Asics. 
You will have trouble scaling with bitcoin, cause of its basics and yes we will need other options. That's totally fine, where is the problem in bitcoin being the premium market. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:16:04
How can somebody from bitconnect scam? XD
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:44:38
I like bitcoin and all, but btc is far from currency usage. 9 min block time? Up to 30 min per confirmation? 12 transactions/s with segwit enabled. Lightning network needs a trusted partner to function, which denies the idea of peer2peer connected money. 
Bitcoin is a store of value and should be treated as such. We are far away from working second and third layer solutions which could bring bitcoin a better usability. Tenx can help to make it spendable but the idea of bitcoin is to only trust the system, which can't be dealt with any time soon in a timely manner by using it as a currency sorry.  
So is it a good speculative investment? Yes. 
Can it overcome currency and replace currency? No. 
It's a safe store of value, for currency usage we have other coins, it could be GAS NEO, stellar,ETH with POS enabled, DASH , so we don't need btc to change drastically. But  we do need to accept it's not the best to buy your 1$ drink with, rather the 100 000$ car/apartment where you don't care to wait an hour for safety reasons.

I had bought into neo/antshares at 20 cent sold at 30 cent :D

Steam stopped supporting btc as I recall and that's a really really bad way to invest. Even anycoin could be better.best: Just ask the parents for a coinbase acc

I am maybe a cunt, especially to people who don't understand what I mean, true that. 
The story itself let's me assume my assumptions with a close to 100% certainty. 
He literally acted on a  kind of  bet, "you won't be able to buy a watch over 20$" - "see I bought a Rolex", like the good old saying "if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it propably is a duck" 
15 year old kid gets told by parent "you can't do that" spending time and effort just to proof him wrong. That's bad attitude. Even worse than my patience with people on the internet who don't get the point... 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:02:06
I am actually working on neopets is there another project for it? :D
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:37:39
Same as weather, just guess xD
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:33:24
I totally agree, I never saw btc as a real currency for small transactions honestly it's more of a store of value. Check neo gas for example, no fees 15sec transactiontime (lower soon) and a max of 1000000 invokes a sec... That's just one example. We got many more options and we need to use them as soon as possible to keep the faith of good tech in crypto. People will get frustrated fast.

Loved the movie
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:19:29
Yes that's exactly what I am telling you. He's a little brad who wants to show of a Rolex, that's just literally the definition of an asshole in the making. And yes that's my view on this. You don't have to share it. But being that reckless with money at such an early age shows 0 self awareness. 
you seem to be as stupid as most people on btc reddit since I did not say he used it as an investment but only to brag, still I took your argument on "the value keeps steady" and mentioned it on a sidenote.  
I will judge you as stupid and him as a brad. Proof me wrong. Do you have a phd or master from an elite uni? If not, pls get on my level before you talk and stfu till then. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:25:18
No I did send them to other exchanges but could be due to miner contracts. Yeah the average satoshi/byte went up a lot. But honestly this looks a  lot like the attack from bcash a few weeks back. They did spam the network to make it seem  btc can't work at all anymore. 
But imho I see no problem in just cranking up a few mbs on the blocksize till lighting is live. Yes you can turn it down  after again, they already did, it was 32mb when btc came out. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:56:50
Ask satoshi :D

You can't stop people from trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:08:14
The exchanges have theoretically nothing to do with bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is meant to be spend peer to peer.

Check out neo transaction possibilities
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:35:11
You don't need to buy pay tokens for the tenx card wtf you talking about. I got the tenx card that's bs. Just send btc to the card and use it nothing more

So what are the chances btc goes down to a hurricane, flood in the inside of Germany? You know btc is highly speculation and homes way lower risk not don't act stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:49:56
Depends on the alt.  Tenx has a real company and real Transactions.  Eth and Neo have real companies bounded to them. Monero ltc are very useful but it can have any value like btc

I actually didn't pay any fees the last weeks, don't know why

If I would be a watchmaker "Rolex" would not be enough for information. 
As a young kid selling your investment after hard work and some luck just to brag and show of defines the commonly known phrase of "this generation is doomed". investing this money to look for the long term value increase is a way better option than going for a Rolex that may hold 60% of its value if you choose a classic and less for exotic choises and gives him a bigger ego. 
It's an open platform, I can criticse his life choices as much as I want, he doesn't need to listen, but he should.

Neo had the highest gain though
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:34:36
It's still a speculation, you want to speculate on your retirement? 
I am all in on btc,neo,tenx but treating it as a safe investment is just wrong. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:35:28
Why can't a currency be a hedge? Don't you think people hedge pound or euro against the dollar? 
I am dev and financial adviser. I work with investment bankers and you showed 0 knowledge of any financial market. 
Again you betray logic, and not answering on your work let's me asume the worst... A hedge is a hedge, and not a safe non volatile investment. You can even hedge on chickens. What kind of education have you achieved not even understanding that? Sorry but I don't talk to non graduates... 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:43:36
Is it less volatile than currency in Venezuela? Yes. (Check it) 
Is it less volatile than Zimbabwe dollars? Yes. 
What is it pegged to if its your only option? 
Assets with low adoption will be volatile obviously, that's what a free market is. The larger it gets the less volatile. 
You also measure it to the dollar why would you in a scenario where we get hyper inflation again? Check how much dollar are "produced" by the federal reserve, then do the math what will happen in a future, like it always does with inflationary currencies. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:04:22
You don't even understand the importance of risk management. What do you do got a living? 
Just an advice, get out of the financial market, you gonna get eaten alive. 
You just asked why would I diversify financial risks that we already see in many other countries? (This will never happen to me, so I don't care) what kind of attitude is that? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:01:30
First no we don't have stable euros and dollars, how could I work with people who gain from these volatilitys if it were? 
For you the 5k in the bank maybe low average working guy, it did not seem to make a difference. 
But for clients of mine with 8-9 digits fees it did in purchasing power. 
Credit: the investment you do had to outperform the deflation of the currency which would be the whole market sentiment. 
This means you margin your chances over the market. 
... Your analysis in Greece good God. How was this dept created? I gave you a backround... I am sorry but do I talk to Bob the builder? This gets ridiculous. Where is your knowledge? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:53:01
No the selling point is not needing to trust on a the government. You think these "civilized" countries won't face problems in the future? 
Why wait for the collapse everywhere without having a backup plan? Why not diversify risk. 
If you do think that the people there will always behave in a correct manner you are just naiv. 
Before full integration of lightning, no. 
May I ask if you actually read about how the inflation is calculated, which models are used, and if you have insight in the financial system. Cause it seems you ask very unspecified questions. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:48:48
1) because before broad mainnet implementation of segwit+ lighting it is not fast enough as such. 
2) already explained
3) thinking a hedging asset cannot be good if volatile is the most stupid thing I ever heard
What kind of securities? Do I maybe know your firm? With your knowledge about Greece, I quite doubt any connection with you and the financial market. What exactly do you do? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:47:18
Collapse of the financial system does not mean collapse in trade, you need a new peg. A peg you can trust. Btc is trustless, that's the whole deal. 
Was Greece not civilized? Check why it happened. The inflation of the currency is normally pegged to the percentage growth of the economy. When you force that on a larger unequal economy like on stole Europe, that whole concept does not work anymore. 
Every financial expert did tell them, there were research articles on it, though they did it anyway. 
What happend 2008?
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:24:08
You so know about Zimbabwe? Venezuela? Germany in the 1920th? 
Only cause you yourself trust your bank does not mean everybody in every country does (or should). 
Also blockchain can achieve Byzantine fault tolerance in systems. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:00:00
And don't get me started on the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:29:02
When the countries currency does not hold value anymore, retailers and people will need a way to transact value, so they will need to expect Btc or chickens/gold. Since btc allows a better currency by easy divisible nature, it will automatically expected. Also decentralized exchanges can't shut down (only the fiat gateway) when the currency in a country dies out, you would not convert to it anyway. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:38:21
Honestly I'm disgusted by your view on Greece, the financial stability of the dollar in 2008 and the idea of you about hedging. Why is somebody like you talking, honest question?
