IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
Announcement Developers
In August 2017, aitcoin forked into two variants. These have taken radically dirrerent
Looking at the situation one quarter later, is clear to us tnat the Blackstream rork or
bitcoin diverges so radically rrom the ideas presented in the aitcoin vvhite paper, that it
is an evolutionary dead end. while it may still have high trading value, as a mere
collectible orcuriosity, the laloclrstream rorlr or bitcoin is not part of building any ruture
rinancial infrastructure, wnicn is what Block Explorer is about.
A currency or the future nas subcent optional usage fees and instant transactions. The
Elackstream fork or aitcoin ("Eitmin Legacy") is at szo usage rees and rising, with no
end in sight, and can take days to conrinn, despite unrulrilled promises to the contrary
on both pains when segvvit activated in what can only be described as a community
ristright we are thererore making the decision to consider the laloclrstream Fork
deprecated, and support it as legacy tecnnology only.
natner, we nave made the decision to support the only bitcoin fark with a postive utility
momentum, which is aitcoin cash. we took an early decision to deploy a aitcoin cash
block explorerand will continue to roll out related services. we are also deploying tools
ror other cryptocurrencies we rind on a positive momentum path, such as zcasn, which
have increased privacy value.
we will not add ruture support ror the Elotkskream Fork or bitcoin rlaitcoin Legacy"),
and will be deprecating it entirely at some ruture point in time to be determined.
Developments nave revealed it to be a dead end. A! such a time, we will rerer to aitcoin
cash as laitcoin only, but will make some errort to not break API calls by changing URLs
of legacy automated systems.
