Working on it...
Not giving away much, unless people donate, not expecting much, unless I come up with something really creative.  I'll also use some of the referral programs, to generate coins for it.
I'll be doing more on my days off.
Make a paper wallet, hide it somewhere, tweet  and I'll RT

Doing it mostly in the physical world, now. Trying it again because of the media hype from the rich guy.
Did it online a 2 years ago.

Bitcoin paranoid checks every 15min for me, and let's me know if it moved more than 3%.
Last year it was set for 6% and it made noise all the time, now I hardly ever hear it.
I also have a widget on the home screen, so I see the price anytime I unlock my phone.

I'm thinking I might change it to 7days, or maybe 48hrs.
I'm not getting any feedback from the people who found them, so I don't know if they are confused, or don't like it or???
I expect android users to be able to gain control of the coins in a minute, I can see other users may need to go home to use a computer.
