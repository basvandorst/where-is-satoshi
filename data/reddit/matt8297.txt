well I watched an 8 million sell wall bust in less than 30 mins so I could see that happening.It's rising but no news has really come out today. Either that or just more people throwing money to try to make more money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:23:02
just remember all those losses would stay unrealized unless you panic sold.

I am praying for a short I have money on the sidelines waiting if it does.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:50:34
Eh it's doing better than BTC at the moment lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:16:06
I wasn't denying they could go long just as I am :)

Futures traders will have the ability to "short" bitcoin essentially bet against bitcoin while long term this most likely won't hurt bitcoin short term it could cause a substantial drop as whales like Wells fargo cash out their physical btc and move to safer futures that can't be stolen from them.

It's called range bound.

I see you copy and paste this everywhere could you at least please fix the "ist" to is please.

Another avenue to go is post to their twitter that makes the issue a lot more public and companies are more apt to respond on social media if called out.

I don't think this is completely true just look at the DOTCOM bubble sure many people lost their shirts in it but it doesn't mean ones didn't rise from the ashes to be a world power in business like amazon and google. I admit Hodl can be a bad mentality I personally prefer the spend then replenish model as its much more healthy for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:26:09
I don't understand why some people have so much pent up hate for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:47:46
Let it fall at least until I can buy on Friday

Bitcoin was made to be decentralized and not easily controlled. Regulation doesn't kill bitcoins original vision.

Because coinbase doesn't support purchase of BTC there...
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:49:57
Heres a tip that will save your ass slappy. If you want to buy put your money on coinbase THEN move it to GDAX it is coinbases direct exchange and has less than a 1% fee.

This time I'm 100% fine with slow and steady.

Bitcoin has been forming an ascending triangle for the past few days pointing to a breakout.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:36:49
All you did was point out spelling errors this disproves you're toxic how?
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:54:15
Not a pennant that is a completely different formation.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:55:38
You don't have to buy bitcoin in whole numbers...
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:24:40


You're all together toxic.

I was assuming capital gains would be taxed off the total amount which is from 10% to 39.5% so you keep $90 to 60.5 from $100 in BCC
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:43:51
You literally just said what op said.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:39:37
To some it may mean that, but to the masses regulation bring with it legitimacy and recognition.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:25:14

Meh it doesn't seem defined enough to be a true head a shoulders I think this is mainly news driven.

To be fair her sofa will be worth 50% less in a year when btc could be worth 50% more

So your saying you don't believe ETH doesn't bring at least some unique things to the playing field?
