The risk is if someone ever gets your accompanying seed words. The nano itself can be replaced, the keys allow someone to get access to the assets regardless of if they physically have the nano or not.

d) they had no interest in holding btc but used it as a payout option from a sports site, received 1.14 BTC when it was 8600 and before they could sell it, it plummeted and now they are in a tough spot. That little boy is me.

Yes, I just started doing TA right now as well and my calculations also show that the price will go up or, alternatively, it will go down. Yes, yes, I definitely put a lot of work into this analysis and everyone should please take me seriously. Good luck all (you won't need it based on the wisdom I have provided).

No problem! And the transfer just went through, sorry for freaking out but thanks for the internet hug lol I'll be more prepared for future transactions ��

Ok thanks, I'll hang tight! 
Edit: initially was concerned about sending from native segwit to the exchange, like potentially a compatibility issue, but that was dumb :)

I just scraped enough fiat together to buy 1 full Bitcoin at 10200. In your opinion that was pointless of me?

I hear ya! I hope you can get there! I definitely had to shake and bake to get one but it is kinda satisfying to be able to say you have a full coin, I hope you can get one at some point too!

Hello... have a technical question. I'm new to Bitcoin and just bought one a few days ago. When I moved it to my nano, ledger recommended a native segwit wallet, so I went with that. I sent some from my nano to Bitrue and it has been over an hour now and is still unconfirmed. Is this normal or should I be  worried? Native segwit can be sent anywhere right, it's just receiving from certain places that is a problem?

Do you really believe that? I finally got 1 btc and now I'm second guessing if it's worth just having one btc at this point/price. Like I missed the train already by not having multiple coins
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:29:54
Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:28:13
I certainly hope you're right :)
@_date: 2019-08-21 09:46:04
Ahh ok, gotcha!
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:09:22
I hear ya lol not second guessing Bitcoin itself, second guessing if getting in so late, at the point where I can only afford 1 full BTC, is ultimately going to be worth it from a roi perspective.

I don't know why anyone uses Blockfolio anymore, they are constantly having these glitchy moments that make people stroke out. For example, I had two occasions where it indicated one of my alts popped and I was up 6 figures... similar stories for other people on Twitter. 
Never had that kind of roller coaster of emotions since switching to Delta.
