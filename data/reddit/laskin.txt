You're correct - the address is the long string of characters that begins with a 1 or a 3. It's the public key side of the equation which can be shared freely.
I think the 100 addresses idea is just for privacy and security. Some people change to a new address with each new transaction. The more times someone uses the same address, the easier it might be to zero in on their identity.

2 factor authentication requires the user to go through an extra step after the usual username/password process. 
Typically it would require a six-digit code generated via a synced authentication application on a smart phone. The code changes every, say, 30 seconds for the user, so each code is intended to be a unique one-time login.

Besides using Windows, it sounds like the OP did everything right.
As always, there's the possibility that these are false claims, but I don't get that impression.
It sounds like it was more the work of one person than a completely automated virus. I'm guessing something like this: a) trojan installed; b) trojan searches for Bitcoin application - once found, notifies attacker; c) attacker monitors OP's activity and grabs wallet when TC volume mounted; d) wallet opened using password obtained via keylogger (or maybe bruteforce - not sure how many cycles are required for each Bitcoin-QT wallet key..)

Interesting questions! My thoughts:
1. It seems like the person would still, in theory, get dinged with an estate tax, but only if the IRS knew of the Bitcoin assets - which they might depending on the method of converting the cash into Bitcoin.
2. Sell contraband on blackmarket for Bitcoin, buy WoW items using Bitcoin, sell items in exchange for USD EMT, declare income from self-employment from WoW (i.e. "I obtained the items from a series of raids on the Isle of Thunder" or w/e.) Seems hard to trace, but probably not impossible.
3. Extremely difficult without major changes. It would be virtually impossible for the government to determine how many Bitcoins I have in my possession at the moment and it would be virtually impossible for the same reasons for them to know that I'm making a transfer.

I prefer secure offline wallets to online wallets. Read somewhere recently that 10% of the value of all mined currency has been stolen from online wallets.
Wouldn't bother with mining Bitcoin, but it depends. Laptops aren't ideal - overheat. And you'd need to invest in a decent video card. But it's going to be pretty difficult to compete with the new hardware that's coming out.
Mining Litecoin is currently more profitable. If you were to try to do that, I'd recommend joining a pool over going solo.

Brilliant! Thank you for the detailed response.
The purpose is mostly to avoid packet sniffers at coffee shops. And hopefully to avoid unwanted packet injection, too, but I trust/hope that is less of a widespread issue. I currently use EFF's HTTPS Everywhere, but its utility is limited.
I've always found Tor to be deadly slow, but perhaps the obsfproxy is faster. I will try it out.
Regardless, I'll avoid the LogMeIn part of the setup, and I'll be sure to generate keys when using SSH.

I take your point and I think it's a good one. If I were in their shoes, I would have sold off maybe 10-20%, even if I had a fair amount of faith in the long-range fate of Bitcoin.
But then again, I have almost no money to my name, so there would be a greater need for me to partially cash-in short term. Maybe some of the earliest adopters are already fairly well off?
Who knows. Interesting question to ponder though.
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:20:38


That you know of. Consider Flashback which infected 600k Macs before it was effectively detected. Or Stuxnet, Flame, Duqu, etc. The probability that you were infected with any of the above three examples is extremely low, but the general point I'm trying to make is that it's impossible to know with certainty that our computers haven't been breached.
The incentive is certainly there for coders to create exploits which specifically target wallets - potential high revenue, basically untraceable transfers from one address to another.
This isn't to say that you shouldn't keep your wallet on your computer either. I'd be inclined to think that it'd be safe in the vast, vast majority of cases. 
My thoughts though: if you're holding large sums of BTC or if you're planning to hold for more than a year without transferring, then maybe there is sufficient reason to use a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:38:53
There are three general types of wallets:
1. Online wallets
2. Digital wallets on your computer
3. Paper wallets
All three are potentially insecure in different ways. I haven't used bitstamp or bitcoin-24, so I can't speak to specifics, but typically when you transfer funds into Bitcoin on a exchange, these funds are added to a wallet on their server. From there you can transfer out to another wallet or continue to use that hosted wallet.
I apologize if this is a vague answer, but I hope it helps a bit.
@_date: 2013-04-07 05:59:46
Maybe a little overkill, but I livebooted into Ubuntu, generated an address in vanitygen, printed a hardcopy, made a Truecrypt volume backup on USB and then rebooted into Windows.
Here's a intro to LTC mining guide: 
And a list of the mining pools:
Re. processor v. video card:
Let's say you have a decent processor. Say an Intel Core i7 3770. According to  you'd be able to generate about 60 kH/s. Compare that to a decent video card like the 5970 which can generate 750 kH/s.
At the current difficulty and price, with 60 kH/s you're looking at about $25.95/mo revenue - not including power costs. There's also a risk that you'll fry your motherboard since you're on a laptop. Not worth the risk.
Mining Bitcoin is much less profitable. The difficulty is likely going to spike in the next two weeks to compensate for the recent price hike. You'd be competing with a lot of ASIC-hardware, botnets, etc. It's getting to the point that unless you are willing to invest in something like the new Avalon ASIC machines, it's not worth the time/energy:  
Hope this helps!

I'm looking forward to reading the article (haven't yet - 30 page paper due in 12 hours) but I wanted to say that  has the most weight in my mind.
Although I have doubt that many coins have become permanently lost, I suspect that the early adopters are interested in holding out for a massive profit down the road - they're in it for the long haul. 
Keep in mind that the smallest unit created was the Satoshi - 1/100,000,000th of a BTC. The designers from the outset had envisioned the possibility that it could become a universal currency and absorb a sizeable percentage of the world's trillions in liquid currency value. In the event that the market capitalization for BTC were to grow to $10 trillion by, say, 2019, each Satoshi would be worth about a half-penny (if I've done my math right.)
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:20:11

Nice that they have Modafinil, but the Piracetam price seems a little high - $39 for 32 grams? Cerebralhealth sells 100g for $10.

@_date: 2013-04-07 02:09:41
If you're just looking at a random transaction without any additional information then it'll just show up as a transfer of BTC from address A to address B - example: 
So, if I'm using Bitcoin to buy goods online then it looks the same from the outside as if I'm sending it to Virtex to exchange for dollars. Can't normally tell what was bought or how much was bought (unless, say, you're playing SatoshiDice.)
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:20:03
Admittedly, that's a nice looking pizza. I'd pay up to $3 million.

I respectfully disagree.
I think that Bitcoin is facing unjust scrutiny considering the number of server farms out there in the business world that consume huge amounts of energy.
But the doesn't mean Bitcoin miners should be let off the hook. We, as a community, have a civic duty to be responsible citizens - and part of that means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. 
I think it's important for the media to highlight this issue (even if there are more important polluters that they should be targeting.) I sincerely hope that it encourages some miners to use some of their new-found Bitwealth to purchase carbon offsets.

"That's would be an amazingly huge drain on society's resources, taken from the many for the few."
Yes, but that's sort of how things are done. Nothing new here. Early adopters took a risk and are being compensated for it. I'm okay with that. 
Governments competing by releasing cryptofiat wouldn't have the same appeal for a variety of reasons.

Right, but BTC price increases should almost be left out of the equation when assessing the soundness of a decision to invest in ASICs (i.e. there's nothing stopping the investor from purchasing Bitcoin now instead and using that as the investment vehicle.)

That's my major concern now... I'm rapidly losing faith in it's longevity.

Yes, I saw that, but there's nothing to suggest Bell Technical Solutions is the same as Bell Laboratories.
Wikipedia: "Bell Laboratories (also known as Bell Labs and formerly known as AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and Bell Telephone Laboratories) is the research and development subsidiary of the French-owned Alcatel-Lucent in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States. It previously was a division of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T Corporation), half-owned through its Western Electric manufacturing subsidiary."
Bell Technical Solutions appears to be a subsidiary of Bell Canada. "Bell Canada is one of the main assets of the conglomerate BCE Inc., also known as Bell Canada Enterprises."
Besides, the work that Reiter apparently did for Bell was many years ago. This guy on LinkedIn is still listed as working there.

Strange that people are being snarky; seems like a reasonable question to ask.
You might want to switch over to mining Litecoin? Based on the current numbers, I think it's several times more profitable. I don't have much faith in its longevity, but that's just my take.
I can't advise regarding opportunities to be paid in Bitcoin for online services. I suspect there won't be much that pays even half-way decent though given that a lot of the crowdsourcing is being completed by people in India where the per capita income is around ~$1200.

I know scammers aren't known particularly for their work ethic, but this is just lazy. 
Realistically they are hoping to get, what, maybe 1 or 2 sales? At $100USD/BTC they are realistically looking at $15,000 profit? They should be going balls to the wall to make this work for that kind of cash. If someone is trying to rip me off, they could at least be courteous enough to put a decent amount of effort into it.

Depends on whether your original wallet is also encrypted (and if so, it depends on the strength of your password - and whether you are certain you will be able to recall.) If you don't plan on spending for a while and if you have secure backups then you can delete original using a file shredding utility.
Edit: There's no need to get rid of your original unless you think it'll still be sufficiently useful or unless you think it's too much of a security liability to keep.

It looks like there is some info on how to add funds here: 
Seems like Blockchain is strictly a wallet-holding service and you have to use a third-party to transfer the cash into Bitcoin.

I doubt I can offer any help in figuring this out, but a few questions: Were you using a legit copy of Windows? Fully patched? Can you give more info on the 10+ chars passwords? Was your Truecrypt volume left mounted overnight?
You might want to download Wireshark and look through all incoming/outgoing packets. Maybe someone can offer specific advice regarding what you'd be looking for, but I would just gradually filter packets out until I was looking at a more manageable set of data.
Edit: Sorry - few more questions... I assume you're connecting using WiFi... What protocol? WPS enabled or disabled? Password strength? Have you changed the default router password? Do you know everyone who is normally on your network?
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:49:56
Backing up your wallet.dat is sufficient. Not sure whether you can open in another program, but I'd assume so. 
Your wallet.dat will be encrypted, so you would need to enter the password in order to decrypt (regardless of what computer it's on.)
Only one wallet.dat is needed - assuming you're not adding any new addresses. If someone were to obtain a copy of your April 7, 2013 wallet.dat and decrypt it they could transfer the funds out in 2020 if the funds were still in that account.
I believe the keys file will be in plaintext so be careful - it should contain your public key and your private key. The wallet, as I understand it, is an encrypted container for all of your public/private keys for all of your addresses. Having lost my phone in the past, the idea of having a plaintext keys file on my phone at any point causes me concern.
You may want to generate a paper wallet as a backup? Can export the keys, print and then place somewhere safe, and then securely shred the keys file when finished.
Hope this helps! I'm sure someone will correct me if any of this is inaccurate.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:15:25
It's a little taboo of a question to ask. A lot of people post to ask whether the price is going up or down (particularly a week ago), but some of the long-term believers in Bitcoin take offence to that sort of thing. The recent crash was fueled by many things, but over-speculation was a key culprit.
Truth is that nobody knows whether it's going up or down tomorrow or next week. I have my reservations, but overall I think Bitcoin has reasonable long-term odds of becoming a pivotal medium of exchange and store of value. Short-term though? No idea - within a month it could tank to $30 or jump back to $250.
