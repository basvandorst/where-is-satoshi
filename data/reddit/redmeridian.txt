It’s not better than all its competitors.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:12:34
The thing is, it’s hard for me to trust it like I did before. Now we have all the speed and few issues along with futures markets influencing the price. Not to mention the number of solid and better performing cryptos that have came out in the last couple years. We gotta admit that we’re in uncharted waters right now, and we sure as hell better care.

My thoughts exactly.  I'm sitting with my finger on the sell button watching all this insanity
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:34:34
Saw this explanation worth repeating:  ripple isn't a currency. It's liquidity. It's a vehicle for moving value. It doesnt compete with other coins. People dont realize that it's because of ripple that the rest of the world will be able to accept our crypto without trusting it. Look into it further. You'll come to find that what's good for XRP is good for every other form of value, including all other cryptos. It scales the ledgers of every coin via the interledger. Ill be able to pay target in DASH for groceries because XRP bridged our currencies...allowing me to pay in DASH and have Target receive that same payment in USD (their choice currency) all at the point of sale and under 4 seconds. People no longer need to trust crypto to accept its value in USD or EUR. Just wait, it will change everything. Buy in or miss the boat!
EDIT: hmm guess I shouldn’t have tried to explain Ripple on r/bitcoin

I wanna say that I've seen them run out on Gemini before, and that they just put up a notice saying they would transfer more from cold storage

This sub is even worse to listen to than /biz/.  In fact, I saw a thread on there last night where everyone was making fun of how deluded the person who wrote this is. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:39:38
I'm guessing the last bitcoin will be mined by some billionaire, placed in a paper wallet, and hidden somewhere for the public to hunt down like a modern day Willy Wonka.

You do know that those machines are mostly used by hookers so they can advertise on Backpage, don't you. People probably saw you using it and figured that you were selling your ass.

I hate when this sub goes wild for a milestone like that because it makes everyone look stupid once the resistance drops it dow. 10+% immediately after.

This is insane news

Dear lord would you mind putting a spoiler tag on this shit?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:33:20
If you're just sending BTC from your Coinbase wallet to another wallet, it's a real small fee. Basically it's what the miners make their money on. They give up their computing power to run the Bitcoin network, and in return, they get the fees we pay every time we send our Bitcoins somewhere. 
The percentage fee on Coinbase is where you get charged for going back and forth between USD and BTC. That fee is 1.5%.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:56:32
I transferred btc from Gemini to my Bittrex account 24 hours ago and it still has 0/2 confirmations.  
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!  I want to by altcoins while they're down!
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:16:11
All you do is copy the address from your ledger and paste it to the btc withdrawal form on Coinbase and it's done. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:14:58
On coinbase, yes. But expect to pay a few % in fees when you use a credit card
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:32:11
Crypto, and especially bitcoin, investors are very ignorant when it comes to even the most basic fundamentals of trading. It doesn’t matter what the coins are looking like, if you come here and tell them anything that differs from the group think, you’re demonized like some kind of Disney cartoon villain out to steal their money. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:56:53
Dear lord do you even hear yourself?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:23:43
You are so weird

Trying to explain bitcoin to friends always makes me think the whole thing is stupid. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:38:22
The only difference is that the babies here get their feelings hurt when you tell them something they don't wanna hear. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:33:25
How pathetic
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:51:29
Should've done that a week ago. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:36:18
No I’m pretty sure it brought people too?
God I hate when bitcoin’s in the toilet and everyone starts waxing poetic.

It looks like a bubble and acts like a bubble, but everyone here says that it isn't a bubble.

As someone who has lost a substantial amount of money in the last few days, these posts are really goddamn irritating. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:29:44
It seems like it.  I read stuff like this and it makes investing in bitcoin look really foolish to me. These people seem like they get their feelings hurt when Bitcoin isn't doing well.
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:52:29
Yeah keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:27:13
How’s that working out?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:40:53
 Not here anyway. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:08:12
And with this mindset people will tell you with a straight face that Bitcoin is a viable replacement for the dollar. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:21:30
That might be the most bullshit headline of all time. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:38:22

Absolutely. They either lose their shit or they sperg out with that idiotic hodl meme. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:18:14
As if the hodl meme wan't lame enough
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:45:03
This is why I think everyone is just kidding themselves when they act like Bitcoin is ever gonna be a rival to any stable currency. 
I've had situations where it would've been easier to buy with Bitcoin, but I still used dollars because I don't feel like paying 20% more than yesterday's price.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:25:13
Investment fraud for something unregulated? It seems like a double edged sword. Bitcoin is nice because it isn't regulated, but apparently that also means the market can go into a tailspin when someone says something mean.   
Also I was talking more about the guys who give these big public speeches as opposed to you or me on the internet. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:20:24
Oh no, please don’t turn me into the internet police!

No you’re delusional for thinking that BTC is gonna be a hedge against stock losses. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:02:00
It's funny how Bitcoin holders get so butt hurt when you tell them something they don't wanna hear. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:08:07
Exactly. People are putting their $50 allowances into bitcoin and acting like they're hedge fund managers. If you want advice on what to do with your money, run far far away from this subreddit

Places like this sub are really frustrating because people seem adamantly against simple pragmatism. You know people go in and out of currencies all the time. When the Swiss franc takes a hit, there aren't any fan clubs getting their feeling hurt.  These little crashes are gonna force the bitcoin people to grow up a little bit. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:58:28
I've got mine on a trezor wallet.  How would that work? I haven't been able to get a straightforward answer that little pea brain could understand

Wow....Reading that made me embarrassed for you. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:59:27
So basically if I put my coins in the legacy account and not the normal account, it allows me to access BTC and B2X after the split?
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:11:17
Or the other way around

@_date: 2017-09-21 14:48:45
So let me get this straight. Everyone involved with Bitcoin can talk shit about fiat, banks and gold with impunity, but the second a big banker says what he thinks, the Bitcoin community gets so butt hurt that they want him prosecuted. 
This is why it's hard to take Bitcoin seriously. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:18:19
My god so do I. It really makes me question the viability of Bitcoin when its supporters not only have that mentality but also think that a misspelling is wildly entertaining. 
I get in the worst mood when Bitcoin is down and I open Reddit only to see these fucking dopes spouting their hodl nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:03:38
Sorry to say, but a big reason these are in crappy neighborhoods is because prostitutes need bitcoin to advertise on Backpage.com. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:30:19
That's why I think bitcoin won't work in the long term. Too many people have this childish outlook. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:13:31
God ain't makin' any more of it.
