"Longest chain wins" may be an over simplification. I suspect people use that term to describe two chains on the same hash algorithm of a related coin.
The miners normally choose the longest chain as POW is an automated process that attempts to remove humans from consensus. There are exceptions, however, such as the March 2013 fork where miner majority chose to build upon the smaller 0.7 chain (as suggested by devs).
Unless the majority of SHA256 miners are also ASIC manufacturers themselves, it is difficult to imagine them willingly choosing to move to another hash algorithm. Altruism did not build bitcoin.
A fork with a new hash algorithm would likely consist of a new group of miners. The SHA256 miners would continue on the original chain initially, as they would effectively be out of business. It is unlikely the new chain would contain the same amount of expended energy and R&amp;D of the original chain. Would the new chain be more susceptible to attack? The market would need to decide.

How would we all "agree to dump"? Anonymous individuals would need to achieve consensus in a hostile, low trust environment (internet). Perhaps some sort of cryptographic chained proof-of-w..

I should clarify - I am only stating the facts at the protocol level. I am not stating a moral argument.
I agree that is not ideal that such a small minority decides on the longest compatible SHA256 proof-of-work chain.
Mining pool operators are currently heavily centralized. However, Bitcoin only works because of the miners -
Before Bitcoin there was nothing even remotely like it. More decentralization of miners should be promoted at the protocol level.

The address at the center (12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S) was the first address that ever spent bitcoins. It connects to blue "packages" (transactions). The package then branches out to where the bitcoins went (orange nodes - other addresses).

Humans have poor judgement when it comes to comprehending large numbers.
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:25:10
That is one possible, pessimistic scenario. I am more optimistic.
It would be better if there were more people behind the miners.
I will note that miners will continue to defer development of the protocol to the professional developers. If the developers push for more decentralization of mining - even if that is not compatible with China's great firewall, I suspect the Chinese miners will still adopt the changes. They will simply need to innovate to get around their own technical hurdles.
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:58:37
Proof-of-work promotes innovation. Innovate, build, spend and improve your mining computers - otherwise get left behind.
Proof-of-stake promotes the status-quo - those with coin can sit and influence.
Recall that Bitcoin has been in operation in the wild for 7 years. Is there another automated consensus mechanism like it?

I suspect the only way to solve this question is to let the free market decide. A fork is not contentious if &gt; 50% miners agree to it. Whether or not the market (consumers, wallets, merchants) follows that fork is another matter. Then again, that is the point of a POW blockchain. Miners are in a tricky spot.

It is simply a way of viewing the three values (block mining difficulty, price) over time. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 21:07:33
Miner consensus on software is easy when the top 3 control &gt; 50% of hash rate -
Miners do what they do best - mine. They are very good at it.
Miners will continue defer to the developers for protocol development. The miners are in a difficult spot. They will decide on the longest chain at the end of the day.
Let us hope continued promotion of decentralization will occur at the protocol level. Big blocks or not.

However, do note that if the community decides on a chain with less work - the chain is no longer secure by definition of the protocol.

Miners normally choose the longest chain as POW is an automated process that attempts to remove humans from consensus. However, human intervention (by the owners of the mining computers) can occur when the network/software behaves unexpectedly or if the market requests protocol changes.
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:03:21
More or less yes. However, do note that if the community decides on a chain with less work - the chain is no longer secure by definition of the protocol.
The term "Longest chain wins" may also be an over simplification. I suspect people use that term to describe two chains on the same hash algorithm of a related coin client.

"The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work,"
"The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity."
"Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."
Simple, logical and beautiful.
I do not revere Satoshi. I simply appreciate the engineering behind the concept.
Bitcoin is possible as POW is an automated process that attempts to remove humans from consensus. Intervention is only required under extreme circumstances, such as the March 2013 fork.
Check-points and arbitrary edicts are not part of the Bitcoin ethos and should be limited in their usage.
"Longest chain wins" may be an over simplification. I suspect people use that term to describe two chains on the same hash algorithm of a related coin client.
This, however, does not necessarily make them altcoins, even if a client intends to make arbitrary changes to protocol variables once a supermajority is reached.
I suspect the market will eventually decide some variables should behave as constants over time (e.g., coin distribution), while others (e.g., difficulty, block size) will be variable.
Trust the machines and the market. Not humans. 
Altruism did not build Bitcoin. Miners will serve their own interests. 
Miners have a lot of power. I suspect they will rediscover this. However, miners will continue to defer software updates to the professional developers.
Developers may need to arbitrarily define variables and throttle on occasion to mitigate attacks (e.g., 1MB block size). However, if an automated, machine and market-based solution is found, that should be preferred. Decentralization of mining needs to be promoted.
Likewise, I suspect that defining variables based on Moore's law and projecting growth years into the future is not the correct path either. Moore's law itself may be a self-fulfilling prophecy, which again, is influenced by humans.

You are correct. It is gameable though. Currently Blockbin only sources data from the blockchain + price. 'Price' is technically gameable too, but at least that is driven by free market principles (hopefully).

A fork is not contentious if &gt; 50% miners agree to it. Whether or not the market (consumers, wallets, merchants) follow that fork is another matter. Then again, that is the entire point of a POW blockchain - trust the chain with the most work. This is the invention of Bitcoin. Miners are in a tricky spot.
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:42:48
Mining majority can perform any fork they wish. The caveat is that they do not want to upset the market in doing so (consumers, wallets, merchants). This is the purpose of POW - miner majority are most likely chasing profit (not other motives), and therefore the longest chain can be trusted to be the most secure.
A fork is not contentious if &gt; 50% miners agree to it, regardless of soft or hard. I am only stating the facts at the protocol level. I am not stating a moral argument.
