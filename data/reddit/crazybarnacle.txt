Think outside the box, they'll just need to glue a poster over the original address.

Enthusiasm for the real btc is quite low too.

50% of base their investment decisions on shit like "andreas antonopoulos made me feel good inside with one of his rambling youtube sermons"

Yes it is. I'm sure a Sammarinese politician wants to pretend they have some real power though.

Actually US banknotes are the superior choice, and actually used by Venezuelans.

I think you'll find that San Marino will do nothing that Italy, the big country completely surrounding it, will not accept.

The big picture is that you keep losing money, and that you should stop.

Apparently it isn't since KYC is perfectly constitutional.
@_date: 2019-04-27 21:57:45
No it isn't. Money is something that is widely accepted in exchange for goods and services.
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:18:49
No, you lose actual money and accumulate only bitcoins.

They're bitcoiners, what do you expect?
@_date: 2019-04-27 16:43:28
You sound like a criminal.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:33:49
You can already, it's called cashing out.
@_date: 2019-04-12 22:55:28
How do you reconcile this with the fact that like 95% of both economics and computer science professionals dismiss bitcoin pretty much outright?
It's you, you're the one suffering from Dunning-Kruger.

lol, r/bitcoin in a nutshell
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:18:09


Yeah but it'll only hurt you.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:32:26
No because the idea is to fool others to buy in order to pump up the price, and then cash out and leave them hodling the bag.

As long as mining is banned. And the brainless pyramid scam speculation. And the darknet markets of course. Actually, maybe it's best to ban bitcoin altogether if you care about Earth's future.

Clearly PayPal is better, but still it's a good decision.

Coma patients do not owe taxes unless they've had huge capital gains during the coma (in which case they can easily pay said taxes, or already have).
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:36:56
Lol you're in for a surprise

The Canadian government, being the high rollers they are, bought $100 worth of bitcoins after being moved to tears by known master orator A. Antonopoulos.
