Gold has excellent properties for store of value in the old times. It doesn't oxidize to start with. Is malleable and hard to replicate in the old times ( since it has high atomic number and tungsten is the only other metal in abundance available. )

I don't get why people find the price changes in Bitcoin strange yet when the net worth of Jeff Bezos changes by the millions and billions a day is all good.

Or we could just accept insider trading as one negative aspect of anarcho-capitalism/pure capitalism and live with the benefits of lack of regulation and decentralization.

Ok that is a legit problem but aren't there workarounds for this that would prevent them from having a headstart. Like the block being verified by the network?

The way you say it, it's like when they first chose ipv4 and after running out of IP space IPv6 was the next natural step and I'm sure there will be an increase to that as well as even more and more things are connected. It doesn't seem like a bad solution since it is bounded by the amount of usage.

As far as traffic is concerned this is a legit solution. In your analogy why is it not a solution?

I have seen this video. But his argument revolves around storage problems and bandwidth problems. All of which are not really a problem today.

Personally I really want it to go back to 1$ just so I can stock up 50million dollars of it

Nice to get to know of his speech. It is rare in the bitcoin community that someone is smart, well articulated, actually understands it and not autistic.

Debt is a productive force in the economy. Debt is based on tbe assumption that next year will be better than this year  hence it is normal for it to be increasing as GDP increases. But we are  gambling each coming year will be more productive and better than the one before that. Which isn't always true and hence economy crashes. But as an abstract concept  we are borrowing money from the future. it is a self-fulfilled prophecy. 
But on the other hand most people wake up and do some shitty job because they are in debt. For macro economics it has different importance than your personal finances.
