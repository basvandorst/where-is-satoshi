Well... thats what it appeared in the begining.. but the reality is they all are same. If trump was differnt, the republican party would not have nominated him. 
They all say things before the Erection. After they becum the president they go and serve the same agenda.. Obama even got noble peace prize for his bullshit. 
Just check the video that I posted.. it's the same countries they wanted to go on war in 2001..  trump banned the same countries.. Isn't that obivious. 
What about Iran now.. why he wants to go on war with Iran? Why all this fabricated blame games? This is a country that has been fighting ISIS inside syria and alqeda on its northern border. And iran is been calling out saudi arabia for beging cheif exporter of 9/11. Now "Mattis"
state secretary is calling out Iran biggest sponser of Terrorism. I guess Mattis did not read the 28 pages from the 9/11 report. It clearly shows how Saudi was directly envolved in 9/11. 
Can't u see its already playing out. Trump is a shill.

Hillary, Trump, obama or Bush they all are working for the same master. They all are carrying same agenda. They are not differnt. 
Check this video from 2001. He tells you about exact same countries that Trump banned. So.. it was bush who started, Obama carried on his legacy and now Trump going to do the same thing, it would have been same if Hillary got into power. They all work for the same master. This Left and right wing is just an illusion created for innocent people to believe they have freedom of choice. They don't.

CUNTS!!!!

Bitcoin blockchain has 1mb size limit. With the amount of transactions, it is full and need to increase the size ASAP. Bitcoin unlimted wants to hardfork (not back ward compatible) to increase the block size. On the other hand, core wants to implement segwit, which is a soft fork ( backward compatible ) to increase the block size and implement layer 2 protocol called Lighting Network. 
Community is not heading anywhere. The debate does not seem to have a solution. To have the solution it should reach  [consensus]( to change the protocol. Both are stuck and not moving forward. 
Both party are full of ego. In the mean time, now it has come to a point they have started to measure dick sizes and compare who has bigger dick and forgot what is the real issue.

How many times they announced it will be the last month/year of the financial collapse? How many times they announced there will be a terrorist attack and given dates?? so many times.. 
There is no real news anymore, anywhere, everything is bought and sold. It's just like core is bought by blockstream and BU is bought by chinese minners. No body really gives a fuck about about others everyone is putting out thier own narrative and spewing bullshit so they can get what they want.

I agree, yesterday in my city bitcoin meetup most of the long time holders were thinking of cashing out due to argument over BU and core. 
All the dramas in the past did not bother them, like 2014 crash, all those hacks, crashes, goverment regulations ect. Now, childish argument over BU and core is making people lose interest from bitcoin over all. I have never seen this happen ever before. Fuck politics.. and every one envolved trying to get power from this fight..

No, it's only ones who do not have bitcoin and the ones who hold alts. They profit from destroying bitcoin from inside. 
 


I am a bitcoin holder
Both sides trying to kill bitcoin to make their won gain will only going to kill bitcoin. Solution is not having competition or fight against BU vs Core vs 8mb. Solution is coming in terms and working together 
The problem here is the ones who are fighting the fight are the ones who do not have bitcoin and they gain from destroying bitcoin.

Q: I have heard that there will be some fees involved in the LN, who will be collecting those fees?
A: Potentially everyone who runs a Lightning-node. Example: Alice wants to send money to Carol, but Alice doesn’t have an open channel with Carol. But Alice has an open channel with Bob, and Bob has an open channel with Carol. Instead of opening a new channel with Carol, Alice can route the payment trough Bob: Alice - Bob - Carol. In this scenario Bob might take a small fee.

We use bitcoin as remittence in Nepal. Only differnce is we send money from Nepal. We buy it from travel and trekking agencies who accept bitcoins in Nepal and sell it to customers who want to send Money from Nepal. Need is growing and not enough bitcoins are coming to Nepal. There are not many people paying in bitcoins for travel and trekking. Main problem here is: idiots who work in travel agencies get confused to oprate wallets to recieve Bitcoins and they try to avoid bitcoins. 
If you are willing, we can buy bitcoins from you and we can pay in NPR to the receiver in Nepal. You will be paying 1% on the excahnge to buy bitcoins. Which is very expensive if you compare it with hundi companies who do not charge any commission to send money to Nepal and they offer Rastra bank exchange rates. 
Only option I see, if you find a source who could sell bitcoins at market rates and sell that bitcoin to us. Again, I think it is not a good practice becasue you are not making any money.

Electrum is just a wallet. When you send bitcoin, it has to get registered in the blockchain and you get confirmed. It says received time 2017-04-15, 05:44. It should be three days after that. It will either get confirmed or sent back to your original address. Dont worry, bitcoin does not get lost.

China never had big volume, all the volume was inflated fake. Now people know about that and they do not care about china anymore. 
-Altcoins saw dramatic price increases and are a danger for BTC
Altcoin is nothing but pump and dump. People are not blind, centralized shitcoin like Ripple got pumped. 
-Scaling debate, transcation volume does not get handled.
Scaling debate does not hold any importance outside reddit. transaction volume was a spam. There has not been any spam lately. It was BU spaming the network to prove their point.

Their argument is: corporates only make investments to make profit, AXA invested on blockstream to gain control. Like every other corporation under goverment regulation they will try to implement KYC after they gain control. 
From core side argument; if we allow big blocks,  most of the nodes can not take the data load and it will get centralized. In case of BU, there is also a concern for development team not being competent. 
I find both argument valid and should not be discarded.

Remittence market is big and making a huge differnce. in most of the third world countries, visa, paypal and outbound western union do not work. Bitcoin is killing it. I have seen it first hand.
There are many small remittence company now relying on bitcoin. For example, when someone living in England wants to send money to Burma. The local remittence company collects money from the sender and someone in burma pays the reciever, most of the time with very little fee or no fees. 
Legally, it is very hard to send money out from Burma. when there is someone who is moving out of burma, which happens a lot, from the money they collected from senders in England, remittence comany buys bitcoin and they sell bitcoins to the people who wants to take money out of the country. Thats how they sustain thier business and make profit from selling bitcoin. This solves both inbound and out bound money transfer problem.

I do not even know where to start. It does concern bitcoin. I hope you know what is bitcoin and how it started. 
Bitcoin is a tool to free yourself from the goverment/banking oppression and corporate enslavement. That digital transaction that you are praising is excatly how goverment takes control of people and take their freedom away with KYC on every step. Where as bitcoin is peer to peer by design and works as cash, it is private.  Digitilization is mass enslavement and Bitcoin is freedom. 
Caste system is outlawed in "URBAN INDIA", how many people live in urban areas? Only 31.6% live in urban areas. Rest 68.4% still live in non urban environment and caste system is still very prevelent. [This]( [this]( and many babrberic incidents like these are still happening in india. 
There are many countries where they have eradicated corruption. Take Denmark or Newzealand for example.. it might be hard for you to believe but there are countries with out corruption.

Chain split is THE worst thing that can happen to bitcoin, weren't we all aganist BU for this reason that it would split the chain. To me sounds bit hypocritical.. 
I think we should wait until Rootstock comes out. I am hoping this technology will bring the scaling we need. Segwit does not really scale, it only saves 60% of the space by getting signatures out of the transaction, which is not enough. LN is not ready, there are problems and need to be fixed. So, the argument; we need segwit for LN is not a valid argument anymore.

Im saying we should have waited for bip149. that is much safer, if people really want segwit. But the present bitcoin is good enough.

Stop spreading your non sense, you have gone out of your mind. Most of the people do not even know about this issue. When they will find out they would be just confused, which one is which, this is not 2011 when only nerds had the coins.

Probably you do not have much invested on bitcoin, and probably it does not matter to you financially. There are people who have all their life savings invested on bitcoin. 
Fees are not high. I send bitcoins from my hardware wallet to exchange and back at least few times a week. Most I have paid is $3.50 only ones.. mostly I pay around $1.50 to $1.80 and it takes about 10 to 20 minutes. I do not think that fee is high at all. for me, High fee narrative is widely used as political tool for power grab and nothing else. 
Bitcoin is decentralized, even if most of the mining is concentrated in china, there is possiblitiy for anyone can start mining, so it is decentralized in nature. 
Segwit does not really help prevent asicboost, I do not know where you go thtat idea from. 
I think best solution is quiet simple; it is to bundle the transactions. Which is already happening with many service providers and this technology should be developed futher.

probably you hold 5 coins and for you its a statement. There are many people who have muhc money invested on bitcoin.. for them chain split is not an option.
