Here's a [guide on a P2P crypto option trading]( on [AgoraDesk]( It's different from Bakkt because it's P2P, but the same general principles apply -- except for the fact that when trading options on a P2P platform, you have a much greater flexibility in underlying asset's notional value, strike price, payment method  etc.

One way to sell your coins is to respond to one of these [AgoraDesk offers]( or [post your own sell BTC AgoraDesk offer]( No KYC/AML required by the platform (though some traders might ask for it on a case by case basis).

You can try to find someone willing to sell BTC for PayPal on P2P exchanges, such as [AgoraDesk](

[AgoraDesk]( is easy to use, like LocalBitcoins, but without KYC/AML.

Give [AgoraDesk]( a try. It's like LocalBitcoins, but without the tedious KYC/AML verification process.

Maybe try posting an ad on [AgoraDesk]( - no KYC there.

If you sell on a P2P exchange like LocalBitcoins (KYC/AML) or [AgoraDesk]( (No KYC/AML) you can sell your coins above the market price. If you use irreversible payment methods (e.g. cash by mail), you'll likely won't get scammed.

You can also post your own call buy ad on a P2P trading platform [AgoraDesk]( -- set your own premium, expiry and exercise price -- and someone might respond.

You don't actually need to meet a stranger to buy coins from LocalMonero. You can use [any of the online payment methods]( the majority of our trades don't involve face-to-face meetups.

Yes, it's a P2P exchange where all the trades are protected by escrow. So there's no risk for the buyer that the seller would try to run off with the money.

This issue has long concerned me, so I've decided to write a free open-source cryptocurrency portfolio manager app - Open Cryptofolio. No accounts needed, all of the data handled client-side, if you wish to wipe cookies at the end of browsing session you can export portfolio locally and later easily upload it. It is still currently under development, but you may expect first release in the nearest time. Here's [GitHub]( for those interested. Stay tuned, I'll be posting updates soon!
