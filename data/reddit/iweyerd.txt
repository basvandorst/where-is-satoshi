Outgoing New York Superintendent of Financial Services  Benjamin Lawsky released sweeping new rules for licensing virtual-currency businesses in the state Wednesday, staking part of his legacy on carving out regulatory oversight for an industry that many experts believe could transform the financial system.
Mr. Lawsky, who has said he will leave his post at the end of this month, announced the so-called BitLicense rules during a speech at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington.
The new rules, posted simultaneously on the Department of Financial Services’ website, require certain providers of virtual currency services operating in New York state—in particular, those with custody of customers’ funds and which exchange virtual currencies for dollars and other fiat currencies—to apply for a specially tailored DFS license. The regulation lays out a variety of specific conditions to keep that license up to date with regard to protections of consumers and anti-money-laundering compliance, capital adequacy, changes of ownership and cybersecurity.
Mr. Lawsky said it was necessary to create this first-of-its-kind regulation for virtual currencies because existing money-transmission laws date back to the Civil War and “simply wouldn’t work” for digital currency, a technology “unlike anything we had ever seen before.”
The BitLicense’s publication culminates an almost two-year draft-and-review process in which providers of bitcoin-based services occasionally locked horns with Mr. Lawsky over their fears that tougher regulation in the country’s most important financial hub could quash innovation in this nascent technology. The BitLicense is expected to become a template for other state financial regulators to follow.

20% of the initial stellars are set aside to be distributed to holders of bitcoin and XRP (19% for bitcoin holders and 1% for XRP holders).  
  
For example, a user owning .001% of the bitcoins in the blockchain snapshot would receive .001% of the stellars set aside for bitcoin holders under this program, or 190,000 stellars.

**This may be necessary...**  
.  
Coinbase, one of the big bitcoin-services companies, has unveiled a new type of account for storing bitcoins, “the vault.”
The new account, which the company describes on its blog, now allows users to have two different kinds of accounts: a “wallet” for day-to-day spending, and a “vault” for long-term storage of their wealth. The vault features a raft of security measures that protect a user’s money, and also makes moving money out of the account a slower, more deliberate process.
It will initially be rolled out to a small number of randomly selected users, with plans to offer it to all the company’s customers over the next two weeks.
“We do know there’s a lot of interest in the bitcoin community in vault products,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told MoneyBeat.  ”Our customers have been asking for something like this for a year.”
The new measures help address one of the persistent criticisms of the entire bitcoin experience: relatively lax security around wallets, the nickname for the online accounts used to store bitcoins. Anybody who lost their money in the Mt. Gox debacle can attest to that. In many cases, all a scammer needs is to trick a user into revealing their “private key” to gain access to their wallet. This happens more often than you might think.
—coinbase 
There have been several responses to this. One is a move toward what’s called “multi-sig” security, in which more than one person must sign off on a transaction from an account. An even more extreme measure is called a “cold” wallet, like the one offered by startup Piper, in which the private key isn’t stored online at all; it’s held only on a printed piece of paper.
Coinbase’s vault is another option along these lines. The new account allows for multi-sig technology and offline storage, and also adds in time-delayed withdrawals, in which users can add a 48-hour delay to any transactions during which time the company will contact the account holder directly to confirm the transaction.
The growth in customers accounts, for both Coinbase and competitor Blockchain, continues to grow at a pretty torrid rate. Mr. Armstrong said the company is seeing growth in its user base of about 3-4% a week, and has jumped from 100,000 accounts a year ago to about 1.4 million now.
“It’s been a pretty wild ride here,” he said.

TOKYO--Just six months ago, Mark Karpelès was sitting on top of the world. Mt. Gox, his Tokyo-based platform that had started as an exchange for Magic trading cards, had in a short time become the world's dominant platform for exchanging the new big thing--bitcoins.
Cut to a snowy February morning in Tokyo, and you find Mr. Karpelès trying to walk past a bitcoin trader holding a sign outside Mt. Gox's offices in the hip Shibuya neighborhood, asking: "MT. GOX--WHERE IS OUR MONEY?"
The trader, Kolin Burges, who had flown in from London, was only one of many customers of the company who have been pressing the trading platform to disclose more about its financial health after it froze customer withdrawals on Feb. 7.
The travails of Mt. Gox illustrate the convulsions of the bitcoin market as the first generation of companies trading the virtual currency face growing technical and security challenges.
Chris Larsen, chief executive of San Francisco-based Ripple Labs Inc., a startup associated with another virtual currency, ripples, likened the convulsions as the bitcoin market expands to the early days of the Internet, when it wasn't clear that the World Wide Web would really catch on.
Then, "it all just seemed like the craziest stuff--who would ever use this?--and now it's absolutely in the fabric of every enterprise on earth," he said.
Mr. Larsen developed Ripple with another bitcoin entrepreneur, Jed McCaleb, the founder of Mt. Gox, who sold it to Mr. Karpelès in 2011. The name Mt. Gox, which came from the Magic card game the company originally dealt in before Mr. McCaleb turned it onto bitcoins, is short for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange.
Mt. Gox has been wrestling with problems since earlier this year, when it halted withdrawals in dollars.
Also in May, some of Mt. Gox's funds were seized by U.S. regulators, who said the exchange wasn't properly registered in the U.S. Mt. Gox said in a statement last month that it is has been properly registered as a money-services business in the U.S. since the end of June.
After Mt. Gox again abruptly halted customer withdrawals on Feb. 7, it blamed its issues on a glitch in the bitcoin software.
On Feb. 10, Mt. Gox said it had been hit by fraudulent requests for payment by users exploiting a feature in the core protocol known as "transaction malleability."
Initially, many in the bitcoin community argued that Mt. Gox had simply failed to use the correct internal procedures to protect its accounts. The next day, however, a hacking attack crippled other bitcoin-exchange platforms and raised questions about the security of the global network for trading the virtual currency.
Asked why the company hadn't addressed customers' concern sooner, Mr. Karpelès responded in an email interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday: "I assume you refer to the malleability issue. We sincerely apologize for this incident; however, please understand that we are NOT the developers of Bitcoin." He added, "We are very surprised that anyone could fault MtGox instead of the bitcoin software."
However, he said, "We deeply apologize for any delays in our responses."
After Mr. Karpelès, who was running an IT company in Tokyo, bought Mt. Gox from Mr. McCaleb in 2011, Mt. Gox became the world's biggest bitcoin exchange by volume, with more than 80% of bitcoin trades, according to Bitcoinity.org, a service that tracks rates on various exchanges. During that time, the price of a single bitcoin rose from 92 cents to a peak of more than $1,147 last December, based on figures from CoinDesk, a bitcoin-data provider based in London.
Amid the turmoil surrounding Mt. Gox, CoinDesk removed Mt. Gox from its benchmark bitcoin index early last week. The index, which now includes just Slovenia-based Bitstamp and BTC-e of Bulgaria, stood at $624.63 in New York afternoon trading Monday, while Mt. Gox-traded bitcoin was valued at just $294.20. Its share of bitcoin trades had dropped to 25% on Monday, according to Bitcoinity.org.
But aside from the lower value of its bitcoins, investors are increasingly concerned about the status of their Mt. Gox accounts. The company's halt of bitcoin transfers to outside accounts led investors to speculate on online forums that the company had its bitcoins stolen by hackers or that it was out of cash and would default.
Tomoaki Ushida, who runs an IT consulting firm in Tokyo, has given up hope of recovering the two bitcoins he had in his Mt. Gox account. "I try to convince myself that I paid for a good lesson," he said. "If I ever get them returned, I'm lucky."
In the email interview, Mr. Karpelès responded to questions about the company's solvency or protection for customers' funds by saying that the matter is confidential. However, he said the company had discussed its business model with Japanese authorities "to ensure that we are operating within the law here."
At a weekly meeting Thursday of Mt. Gox investors and other members of Tokyo's small, tightknit bitcoin community at a bar about a 10-minute walk from Mt. Gox's headquarters, some 30 bitcoiners talked about bitcoins and exchanged the currency using cellphone-readable bar codes. Some members reminisced about tipping burlesque dancers in bitcoins at a bar called the Pink Cow in Tokyo's foreigner-rich Roppongi neighborhood that accepts bitcoins for payment.
But the conversation revolved mostly around Mt. Gox and whether the exchange would be able to honor deposits. Organizers had extended an invitation to Mr. Karpelès but said they didn't receive a response.
Ken Shishido, one of the group's organizers who works in the telecom industry, said, "Everyone's question is whether the company still has everyone's bitcoin and cash. That's a very critical thing we need to know."
Mr. Burges, the London investor, was among the bitcoiners Thursday night. The next morning, outside Mt. Gox's offices, he managed to get in a brief confrontation with Mr. Karpelès. "You still have everyone's bitcoin?" Mr. Burges asked while Mr. Karpelès tried to navigate around him holding a Starbucks cup and an umbrella.
In the wider Japanese business community, bitcoins aren't widely used or even well-known. Japanese officials are cautious about making any comments about bitcoins as they wait for the Bank of Japan to finish a study about the virtual currency. Still, some Japan-based lawyers say certain restrictions, especially on exchange platforms, should be considered in order to prevent criminal use of the currency, such as for money-laundering.
"I believe that regulating exchanges would be the best way to address these problems," said So Saito, a lawyer at the Tokyo law firm of Nishimura &amp; Asahi.
Meanwhile, the turmoil at Mt. Gox has even touched the Pink Cow, home to the burlesque dancers, which has switched to another bitcoin payment process called BitPay.
Mt. Gox transactions are "taking an unacceptable length of time right now, so we are taking another route," said owner Traci Consoli. "Hopefully, a more stable system will evolve as it grows."

Venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, where Mr. Andreessen is a co-founder and partner, has made about $50 million of investments in the area—believed to be more than any other firm—from a $1.5 billion fund, the firm says. The Palo Alto, Calif., firm plans to invest hundreds of millions of additional dollars over the next few years from other funds, people familiar with the firm say.  
Mr. Andreessen says he is convinced of the bright outlook for digital currencies despite setbacks such as the collapse last month of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, one of the most prominent bitcoin exchanges, which said it lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the virtual currency. "I'm completely unfazed and plan to invest more," he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.  
The move exposes Mr. Andreessen, best known for co-founding Netscape Communications more than two decades ago, and his investors to greater risks amid uncertainty over the future of bitcoin. The currency isn't backed by a government but recently has become popular among technology enthusiasts, trading at various times over the past year for less than $100 and more than $1,100. It traded Friday at around $580.  
For all of Mr. Andreessen's enthusiasm, some bitcoin fans aren't thrilled with the interest by venture capitalists and worry about the encroachment of big business. Bitcoin allows users to transfer money—or other items, like legal contracts—without an intermediary such as a bank.
"You've got a bunch of bitcoiners and young libertarians who don't have enough confidence and life experience," says Cody Wilson, a founder of Dark Wallet, which seeks to enhance anonymity within digital-currency networks. "So they are being lulled into the [venture capitalist] set in California and New York. There's just not enough confidence to go against the grain and question the whole goddamn thing."  
And there is skepticism among other investors.  
"For 99% of people, bitcoin doesn't solve any problem they have," says Bradley Golding, a managing director at New York investment firm Christofferson, Robb Co., which specializes in investing in financial companies and has decided not to invest in bitcoin-related companies. "Most people are comfortable going to their bank, making a deposit and using a credit card…It's a solution in search of a problem."  
Initially, Mr. Andreessen and his partners at Andreessen Horowitz were skeptical the world of virtual currencies held attractive investments. Even if they could discover ways to bet on the area, Mr. Andreessen figured it would be a challenge gaining the support of the firm's investors, including institutions such as Princeton University and the Ford Foundation.
Further muddying the picture for some conservative investors, many fans of these digital currencies were eager to replace governments and other institutions, and some proponents seemed to rely on digital currencies to enable unlawful activities.    
By last April, however, Mr. Andreessen decided it was time to approach his firm's investors about bitcoin. He waited until the end of an annual meeting of Andreessen Horowitz's advisory board at the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel in Menlo Park, Calif., to broach the idea.
"At first blush, you're going to think we're out of our minds," Mr. Andreessen says he told the group of five investment firms on the Andreessen Horowitz advisory board, "but we're going to invest in a fake mathematical currency."  
The comment met with stone-cold silence, before a brief discussion ensued. Some investors seemed intrigued, but many had little idea what bitcoin was.
Ultimately, Mr. Andreessen said investor resistance was less than he feared. Venture-capital firms have free rein to make almost any kind of investment. Their investors generally anticipate about half the investments will be losers, while some others will be home runs.
So far, Andreessen Horowitz has invested $25 million in Coinbase, which creates digital wallets, and a smaller amount in Ripple, a payment system, among other investments, according to Andreessen Horowitz.  
Along the way, Mr. Andreessen has become one of bitcoin's leading evangelists, writing frequent articles and blog posts about the possibilities of digital currencies. This month, Mr. Andreessen sent Twitter messages calling bitcoin an "important tech breakthrough." He said that "the ideas stand on their own, the math stands on its own, the code stands on its own."
Bitcoin was developed in late 2008 by a person or group called Satoshi Nakamoto. It is an electronic currency that doesn't exist in a physical form. Bitcoin is created by "miners'' as payment for verifying bitcoin transactions using a complicated mathematical algorithm, a process that requires intense computing power.  
Mr. Andreessen says bitcoin reminds him of the early days of the Internet.
"I'm having déjà vu," Mr. Andreessen says. Bitcoin is "weird and scary and nerdy, and it's full of scams and frauds, just like the Internet was."  
Still, Mr. Andreessen says it took him years to appreciate the business possibilities.
He recalls reading an academic paper in 2009 about the launch of the bitcoin software, which seemed to improve on past related work, such as DigiCash, invented in 1990.
"I'm not a serious mathematician, but I know a lot of really good mathematicians and computer scientists and reached out to them," he says.  
Throughout 2010 and 2011, Mr. Andreessen discussed bitcoin's development with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and others but still didn't think it was an appropriate investment.
Over time, Mr. Andreessen became convinced virtual currencies would enable a huge number of productive endeavors, raising intriguing investment possibilities that he and his colleagues hadn't considered. If an Internet user can transfer digital contracts, signatures, money or other property in a secure fashion, while avoiding the hefty fees of intermediaries such as banks and credit-card companies, bitcoin and other digital currencies will gain mainstream popularity, he says.  
When Mr. Andreessen realized more participants would adopt virtual currencies, which in turn would lead to more acceptance, he decided his firm had to act.  
"I realized it's a four-sided network effect—users, merchants, miners, developers," he says.
By last spring, it was time to approach Andreessen Horowitz's investors. Over lunch a few weeks after Mr. Andreessen's embrace of bitcoin at the Andreessen Horowitz meeting, Elizabeth Obershaw, a managing director at Horsley Bridge, a San Francisco firm that invests in Andreessen Horowitz, returned to the idea.  
"Tell me about that little teaser," Ms. Obershaw, whose interest had been piqued, asked Mr. Andreessen.  
Mr. Andreessen began explaining his firm's interest to Ms. Obershaw and other investors.
"I was skeptical," says Andrew Golden, president of the Princeton University Investment Company, which manages the university's endowment and invests in Andreessen Horowitz. But, he says, "This was a smart team telling us we need to look at it in a different way."
Like the Internet, bitcoin will emerge as an accepted technology, Mr. Andreessen argues, as it becomes more regulated and consumers and businesses become more comfortable with the idea of digital currencies. With those changes, he predicts, the subversive politics often associated with the currency will fade.  
"We like fringe technologies but not fringe politics," he says.

Unfortunately, when I stopped into a Kmart in Redwood City the clerk informed me that I couldn’t buy a gift card with another gift card. *“You can only pay with cash or a debit card,”* she says. “Even if I’m using a Kmart gift card?” I ask pathetically.  
She calls over a manager who looks at me like I’m a **money-laundering criminal type** and reiterates that I cannot buy a gift card with a gift card. I’m in a Kmart. And I don’t have the means to buy what I want. Double humiliation.

**Here is the full-text article without an extra click**, compliments of me.  
.  
Russian authorities have softened their tone on Bitcoin; the central bank now says it won't hamper the usage of the virtual currency whereas previously it had vowed to crack down on the electronic payment instrument.
                              
The Bank of Russia is now accumulating information about so-called crypto-currencies and is not blocking Bitcoin, the central bank's first deputy chairman Georgy Luntovsky said Wednesday.
"At this stage we need to watch how the situation develops with these kinds of currencies. These instruments should not be rejected," Mr. Luntovsky said.
Earlier this year the central bank warned that using Bitcoins to buy goods, services or real currencies would be viewed as a potential involvement in dubious operations and financing terrorism.
Russia's general prosecutor also said earlier this year that Russian law said the ruble is the only official currency and using "money substitutes" such bitcoins is illegal.
Bitcoin has fallen under increasing scrutiny around the world amid concerns it could be for illegal activities. Bitcoins are an increasingly popular currency to carry out electronic transactions, as some users say they are cheaper and faster than using credit cards or money transfers.
Mr. Luntovsky admitted that there was evidence that Bitcoin had been used in Russia to pay for drugs and weapons.
"It turns out that criminals start to use everything new," Mr. Luntovsky said.

The annual postseason college football game played in St. Petersburg, Florida will for the next four years be known as the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl as part of a sponsorship deal signed between bitcoin payment processor BitPay and ESPN Events.
The arrangement marks one of the most high-profile marketing initiatives yet for a bitcoin-related business and comes as the digital currency continues to gradually make inroads into mainstream commerce.
In an announcement Wednesday, BitPay and ESPN Events, a subsidiary of sports network ESPN, said the name change would take effect at this year's Dec. 26 game and would continue each year through the 2016 game. 
 
The game will air on ESPN. Tickets, which start at $40 each, and associated merchandise will also be available for purchase with bitcoin through Bitpay's processing services.
The St. Petersburg game, which previously bore the name of the Beef O'Brady's chain of sports-themed restaurants, is in its first year of a new college football affiliation with the Atlantic Coast Conference and the American Athletic Conference, each of which will field a team for this year's event.
BitPay's foray into college football sponsorship coincides with a new drive toward bitcoin adoption by retailers and other merchants. Over the past three weeks, satellite TV provider Dish Network and travel site Expedia Inc. have both announced they would accept bitcoin. 
In the six months before that, businesses such as online retailer Overstock.com Inc., NBA team the Sacramento Kings and space-tourism provider Virgin Galactic started accepting the digital currency.
Though the deal is the first bitcoin sponsorship for a televised U.S. sporting event, it isn't the first connected to a digital currency. Those honors go to a currency known as dogecoin, which promotes itself via an Internet meme image of a shiba inu dog. 
Dogecoin sponsored Nascar's Josh Wise at Alabama's Talladega Superspeedway on May 4. The sponsorship deal cost $55,000, with the funds raised via donations from dogecoin enthusiasts that were denominated in the digital currency.

At first, the problems with the Tewksbury Police Department system — difficulty calling up arrest and incident records — seemed to be just the usual system crankiness. No big deal.
But it persisted, and a technician was called in.
  
That was when the menacing message popped up on the screen, an explanation in the form of a ransom note:
“Your personal files are encrypted,” it read. “File decryption costs ~ $500.” 
It continued: “If you really value your data, then we suggest you do not waste valuable time searching for other solutions because they do not exist.”
 
Tewksbury had joined the list of police departments victimized by “ransomware,” an insidious form of Internet crime that is crippling computers worldwide.
“My initial thoughts were we were infected by some sort of a virus,” Tewksbury Police Chief Timothy Sheehan recalled of the attack on Dec. 8. “Then we determined it was a little bit bigger than that. It was more like cyberterrorism.”
Digital thieves smuggle ransomware programs with names like KEYHolder, CryptoLocker, or CryptoWall by sending tainted e-mail messages, such as a fake notice from a package delivery service containing a hyperlink that infects the recipient’s computer when clicked.
Once on board, the ransomware program encrypts the victim’s data, making it useless without a key that unscrambles it. The victim can obtain the key by paying a ransom, usually a few hundred dollars.
The cyberattack on Tewksbury police proved so sophisticated that specialists from federal and state law enforcement agencies — plus two private Internet security firms — could not unscramble the corrupted files. After five days of desperate efforts to unlock it, Tewksbury police decided to pay the anonymous hacker the $500.
The attack was first reported over the weekend by the Tewksbury Town Crier. 
Among other small-town police forces hit was the Swansea Police Department. It fell victim to the same threat in November 2013 and paid $750 to get its files back.
The police department in the Chicago suburb of Midlothian paid $500 in January. In Dickson County, Tenn., the sheriff’s office came under attack in October. Despite seeking aid from the FBI, the agency ended up paying $572 in ransom.
But in Durham, N.H., Police Chief Dave Kurz chose not to pay because the department had backed up the encrypted information and could work around the seized database.
“We had to clean essentially all the computers, but all of our data was prepared,” Kurz said.
The four-member police force in Collinsville, Ala., was hit in June, with the hackers demanding $500 to free up a database of mugshots. Chief Gary Bowen dug in, refused to pay, and never got his department’s files back.
“There was no way we were going to succumb to what felt like terrorist threats,” Bowen said.
As best as law enforcement can tell from the incidents, no data were stolen, nor were details of investigations or other sensitive police matters posted online.
The evil genius of ransomware is that victims are far more likely to pay small amounts to recover crucial data. And if enough people give in, the total can be substantial. Although the virus’s success rate is unknown, a survey of CryptoLocker victims in the United Kingdom by the University of Kent found that 41 percent paid up.
“It’s the old idea that if a million people give a dollar, you have a million dollars,” said Diana Dolliver, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama who specializes in cybersecurity. 
But in Detroit, hackers in April 2014 demanded the equivalent of $800,000 to unlock a city database they had encrypted. The attack became public in November, when Mayor Mike Duggan told the Detroit News the city had refused to pay because the vandalized database was not being used and did not contain critical information.
“It was a good warning sign for us,” Duggan told the newspaper.
In that case, the attackers demanded payment in bitcoin, a digital currency that is much harder to trace than other forms of money. 
Moreover, in the Tewksbury case, hackers demanded that a bitcoin payment be sent through Tor, a technology that makes it very difficult to identify the physical location where the money is received.
Data security experts at Dell Inc. estimate that in a six-month period last year, CryptoWall infected more than 625,000 computers worldwide, including 250,000 in the United States. During that time, the gang that operated CryptoWall raked in about $1 million in ransom payments, according to Dell.
An earlier ransomware program, CryptoLocker, was even more profitable, hauling in between $3 million and $27 million, according to various estimates.
The Tewksbury attack revealed the hydra-like nature of some computer viruses. The Department of Justice declared last summer that an operation to disable CryptoLocker and a related virus had succeeded.
Yet other ransomware viruses have appeared in its place, doing basically the same thing.
“This is very likely a case of one of the many CryptoLocker copycats infecting police departments,” said Kyrksen Storer, spokesman for Fire Eye Inc., a Milpitas, Calif., cybersecurity firm that helped develop an online tool for retrieving files corrupted by CryptoLocker.
The Tewksbury attack featured ransomware called KEYHolder, which is designed to cover its own tracks. Tewksbury authorities sent their infected computer server to the Commonwealth Fusion Center, where Massachusetts State Police work with federal law enforcement agencies on antiterrorism and cybercrime cases. Despite their best efforts, the KEYHolder encryption proved unbreakable.
The department might have refused to pay if it had up-to-date backups of its files. Tewksbury police regularly back up their data, but those files had separately become corrupted and unusable. With no way to crack the code, Sheehan felt he had no choice but to pay to recover his original database.
Computer security analyst Brian Krebs, author of the book “Spam Nation,” said it is no surprise ransomware attacks against police agencies have become public, while those against private companies have not.
“They’re dealing with public funds,” Krebs said. “They can’t hide the fact that they paid the ransom.”
Although most ransomware attacks are sent out by the thousands, Krebs warned that criminals may target specific businesses or government agencies that might be willing to pay larger sums.
“You get inside of a pharmaceutical company or something like that, that has all their net worth tied up in their files,” Krebs said, “they’d be willing to pay a lot more.”

David Woo
"We believe Bitcoin can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers. As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin has clear potential for growth, in our view."
That quote is from David Woo, FX and Rates Strategist at Bank of America/Merill Lynch.
Woo is one of the most genuinely brilliant minds on Wall Street, and that statement is huge.
Here's why: Lots of folks have made positive noises about Bitcoin. Ben Bernanke, for example, said it "may hold long-term promise" but mostly spoke very generally about being open-minded toward digital currencies. He never said anything specific.
Various hedge fund managers have made positive statements about Bitcoin, but you have to take their comments with a grain of salt. Most of them aren't experts in economics, and just get excited by things that go up or down by a lot (which obviously Bitcoin does in spades).
But Woo's analysis represents a top-flight mind at a major financial institution assessing it in a serious way, and coming to the conclusion that it could be the real deal.
Woo even identifies the three things that need to happen for Bitcoin to be worth what it currently is:
Our fair value analysis suggests that to justify the current Bitcoin valuation, it will need to (1) account for at least 10% of all global e-commerce B2C transactions, (2) become one of the top three players in the money transfer industry, and (3) acquire a store of value reputation close to silver.
Bitcoin is lodging into people's minds, and not just as some theoretical amusement that might one day be meaningful, but as something that can be defined and judged against benchmarks. As such, Woo's note represents the biggest endorsement of Bitcoin to date.

Our questions and answers about Bitcoin to Peter Thiel 04/09/2013 | By Joerg | No Comments
We had the honor to have been invited to an event by Peter Thiel and Dr. Philipp Rösler last Saturday.
It was exciting to meet the two personalities and to hear what Mr Thiel economy and startups. He had many tips and tricks in terms of dealing with VCs and under what criteria he evaluates companies and entrepreneurs .
Very pleased about that the former CEO of PayPal held the whole presentation and the subsequent discussion in German. He spoke almost accent- free German and you realize every second with him , that he is an impressive personality . He has a feel like they have few people .
Although our Vice-Chancellor made ​​a good figure and a good speaker , so he went along with Peter Thiel under a little . Wrongly , as we find , for the party of Mr. Rösler can think what you want but Dr. Roesler is committed to the German startup scene . This is not outweigh in gold and it inspires us all to continue to work on our goals .
The quotes of the evening Mr. Thiel show that he invest in people who believe in the cause and not the money.
*"A company should enter the first 5-8 years of no profits , otherwise you have done something wrong. It would be a shame to stop by growth pays dividends "*
*"When I hear of a company that is planning an exit strategy from the beginning , I will not invest . "*
As an example, he brought the legendary story of the 22 -year-old Mark Zuckerberg, who declined the offer of Yahoo Facebook to sell his company for a billion . He was then asked by journalists why he does not sell .
His answer was: " What should I do with a billion are , I wanted to start and operate a social network. With the Millarde I'll probably build a new social network, which is probably worse than Facebook. "
Also the following quote from Thiel on entrepreneurship shows his point of view clear:
*"Work -life balance is interpreted completely wrong in my eyes. What would we say if our German football player before a big tournament only 30 - playing football week 35 hours "*
Work-life balance should be interpreted much more that entrepreneurs are looking from the beginning something fun preparing them so that the work is actually leisure. This mentality is between Europe and the American States or Germany yet very different:
*" In America, the top graduates of the top universities do not want to work in groups , they want to build a business yourself and realize themselves .*
*I think that's the big difference between Germany and the U.S.: If Germany is riff that the best start own business instead of going to Goldman Sachs, Germany will also yield great undertakings "*
The highlight of the evening for us was the fact that we had the chance to ask Peter Thiel for his opinion about Bitcoin .
Small ball : he had taken much time to respond to this question. Maybe because it was the first real question to him as an entrepreneur. The rest of the questions were a mix of idea conception and self-presentation. Who his company and his own opinion is five minutes in the foreground and at the end asks : " Am I correct or can you help me " in our opinion, was out of place in this discussion . Sometimes it is better to ask short questions and listen to for long .
Back to the question asked : Peter Thiel looks similar to the community at Reddit or Twitter the Bitcoinwelt . First, he held a 500 euro bill in the amount to make the audience aware of their reaction to the money . A murmur went through the crowd and heads turned .
Thiel stressed that the real value of the certificate is in the 500 - euro cents range . He wanted to show that money is based on confidence and has the value that society gives him .
He was very surprised how willing people took up the topic Bitcoin last year . He also did not think that so many people in the world understood quickly what Bitcoins are , and believe in the vision. In principle, it was exactly what he had initiated with Paypal at the time.
He has already made ​​the first investment in the Bitcoin economy : Bitpay is probably the most well-known company, which he supports with the Founders Fund , where he is a partner .
When asked how much he estimates the probability that Bitcoin is a world success , he replied:
*"I believe that bitcoins to 20% is a huge , worldwide success. "*
It will depend on his opinion whether and to what extent ordinary people accept the value of digital Währugen . My neighbor at the table smiled and said : " 20 % is not much, as you have probably still a little hope . "
I replied : "If Peter Thiel , an analyst , chess player and one of the largest investors are nowadays one thing 20 % probability of success , then I do not know but hope that we go in the right direction. What have you again for a project? And how much chance do you think that Peter Thiel will give your company to become a global success "
His smile vanished abruptly.
