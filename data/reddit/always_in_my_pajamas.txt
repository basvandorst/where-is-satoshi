Great article... Love the color design! Downloading the app image right now!

I'm actually impressed Roger knows the word "eloquent" tbh

I don't get why the author chose Delacroix's self portrait

Please stop comparing a human being to a god.

This argument is been around for ages, I don't buy it, it's not like we didn't have war when the world ran on gold.
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:20:14
On the francs? Cool, that makes sense now... Thank you!

That's bad advice, you're much more likely to lose money trading
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:32:28
Because they were (are) more interested in taking over the name rather than in technical differences.

Destroying gold was possible in the past as well, it could have been thrown in the sea or in a lake. Destroying private keys reduces available quantity so it makes the victor richer indirectly.

You could say something similar about veganism too!

Sure, just delete comment then claim "I'm being c3n$or*ed!".
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:47:54
Totally different game theory, dude. Totally different incentives. Your logic is broken = you say "incentives are hard, code is easier" then you go on recommending people to trust the team that can't even get the code right.
Broken logic is broken, dude. Broken.

He's just trying to shift the conversation to something more debatable.
The core vision is in the right place. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 08:53:56
I have a node. It rejects invalid blocks. No, it doesn't count hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 11:59:18
Probably cause Ver lost the debate with Johnny.
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:59:17
Doesn't that only work with the Nano S?
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:04:26
Would it mess with segwit blocks, if that was activated?
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:41:51
Yes, this is really ironic. Left is right, up is down, black is white and core is shite. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:30:58
Theymos. We wouldn't have to do this if it hadn't been Theymos.
Thermos theymos theymos.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:43:54
Can you do that with ledger? How? I've been running a node for almost a couple of years now but never took advantage of that option
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:04:25
He lost his private keys.
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:18:12
Reading a book? Pfff, more like endlessly scrolling down on the smartphone and shitposting on reddit
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:45:51
Sounds pretty dumb

@_date: 2017-03-15 20:04:51
Where's BU testnet?
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:01:58
The problem is that BU (emergent consensus) also changes the game theory behind bitcoin (nakamoto consensus).
 
Which is way more complex to analyze and predict than code. So it changes the incentives on top of the code. Where can I see a public testnet where I can see BU incentives at work?
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:47:08
Wish it was compatible with the ledger nano
@_date: 2017-01-15 15:59:33
Come on, dude...Stop fueling hate

Enough with these stupid memes
@_date: 2017-01-21 07:48:34
But somebody else could use the exploit, so by delaying you risk getting 0, therefore it still makes sense to go for it

Satoshi is a public figure. So it's okay if we dox him. Retarded. Ver's logic is really, really dumb there. Really dumb.

Imho this is not really about attracting new users to r/btc rather than helping claiming of an healthy oganic grown community in the future

+1 here, I have some formal training. To be honest, it doesn't make much of a difference. Economics is very political.
It might actually detrimental. We have spent years trying to indoctrinate ourselves into certain beliefs and it's hard to admit that most of it boils down to sociological assumptions.
The investment in the current system makes it difficult to be open minded, imho.
@_date: 2017-04-02 07:17:52
Fuck yeah, bring it on! This is awesome!

Love how the Cash fork in the first graph takes on the same color of the original chain even though the clients are incompatible.

This website is hilarious, the author coulnd't be trying harder. I love how the vehicles are in color in the bitcoin cash highway and in black &amp; white only in the bitcoin highway.

Most critics of LN argue that a generous return on capital will result in centralization of the network. 
So in a sense, this statement is the opposite of what I would expect a biased observer to say.

I'd like to add that a cup of coffee in 2000 was 1000 lire, which were supposed to be 50 eurocent worth. It went from from the equivalent of 50 cents to 1 euro in a couple of years during the transition.
