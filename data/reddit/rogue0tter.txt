There are a lot of alts that handle scaling MUCH better than bitcoin. Bitcoin paved the way, but it is not the future

I just view it as the old man teaching him a lesson about not being cocky, just like the whales remind the fishes to not worry about dips and to not brag about their gains.

Would you bet all your bitcoin on a coin flip?

The old guy is correcting the younger dudes behavior, the old guy clearly has it figured out. The old guy wouldn’t have corrected his behavior if he was still a cocky old shit

I used the terms fish and whale to indicate the amount of bitcoin each had and to make a reference to the term whale as a little pun. I’m very aware that not every person who was around back when a bitcoin was $100 is a whale, that isn’t what I was implying

You made a huge assumption in that they only define themselves by their money though. This is a one liner story about a cocky young blood being taken down a few notches by someone who knows a lot more than them

The wisdom he was sharing was don’t be cocky with what you have and don’t assume it’ll be like this forever. He knocked the young guy down a few pegs and taught him a lesson. I’m sure that put things in perspective

Changed a letter and knocked off a zero;)

To be as rich as those guys they very likely worked their whole life building (or inheriting then subsequently building) a big business. There is no reason to assume that the person in this story got his money from slaves and has done nothing to deserve his wealth. That’s an incredibly telling assumption to make about someone that you know next to nothing about.

I know many jacked dudes who are just as insecure as the rest of us. Imply that they are small or they skip leg day and they will try to fight you. The only thing that fixes insecurity is being confident in yourself not only physically but mentally. They both might be pricks but I’m not sure that is a fair assumption based on a third hand story.

The old man has learned his lesson, as shown by his correcting of the behavior of the young man.

The old dude billionaire 1) probably earns the young dotcom guy’s net worth in a year 2) is capable of continuously generating that wealth without getting lucky one time with the boom of an industry. When the old dude sees this young dude who got lucky one time start bragging the old dude knocks him down a few pegs by betting his net worth by (basically) drawing two cards from a deck and whoever has the highest card wins. Old dude makes it very obvious that the entire networth of this young guy means NOTHING compared to the people he was around and was making a fool of himself for bragging about it. Moral of the story in the context of bitcoin: newbies who are bragging/upset about their gains/losses due to the recent boom/dip of the bitcoin market seem like little fish compared to the seasoned whales who’ve been around since $100 (not that long ago) and earlier

It simply an explanation of an analogy, no need to make assumptions

This is exactly the kind of gatekeeperish mindset that prevents bitcoin from growing. If you don’t feel like educating people, point them to resources. More buyers is good for us. It is incredibly ignorant to just stop talking to people because they don’t understand bitcoin.

This is true.
