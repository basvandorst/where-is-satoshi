The guys that make Robocoin just bought an premade machine from a company called Turnkey. We don't know for sure, but presumably those machines are designed to run Windows XP Embedded and that's the only thing that there are driver for (remember that they need cash handlers, cameras, palm scanners). It's easiest to just go with what the manufacturer of the machine is doing.
Someone else mentioned that XP embedded is also still supported, and can handle .NET, which means that writing software for it is a lot easier than many other systems. (.net runs on everything that Microsoft makes these days, including Xbox, so there's lots of documentation and tools that make it a lot easier to write code for.)

Hmm, we've been looking at getting one of the fifth-generation replicators at my work, but sounds like that might be a bad idea based on this thread. 
Can anyone recommend a "consumer-level" 3D printer that is as advanced as Makerbots? We're trying to minimize training and operation hours,  so anything like a reprap that you have to fiddle with for hours is totally out. 
From what I've seen, Makerbots are the only ones with extra sensors (auto levelling, stuck filament, etc), which should make our lives a lot easier, but maybe there are competitors? 
Price isn't really an issue, but we are looking for a makerbot type printer (not a $10k powder printer that does full color and uses lasers)

Usually, when you run bitcoin, it goes out and fetches what it believes  is the correct blockchain from any other peers that it can connect to.
If someone happened to have 51% of the hashing power, they would be able to generate a second, fake, blockchain, that starts out real, but has been slightly modified to undo or change some transactions. Without checkpoints, your client wouldn't know any better, and would just blindly grab and this bad data (typically this is not an issue, remember that we're talking about someone that has the hashing power to actually generate this bad data that looks real.)
So to combat this, they developers are just hardcoding checkpoint values that say "the hash of block 279000 is abc123xyz456" straight into the client (since this is now widely known, trusted historical information). If your client goes out to download data and the hash that it receives for block 279000 doesn't match the checkpoint, then it will know that something's up.

I'm guessing that you're trolling since that address has nothing in it,
But in the unlikely even that you're not, that's your private key, and anybody that has access to it will be able to spend your coins.
Your public address (starts with a 1) is derived from this private key. (which starts with a 5)
So don't send any coins there.

Look at how vanity wallets are generated, I can look up specific links later, but it sorta lets you do that.
The receiver generates an intermediate key, the sender uses that to generate an a real address and another intermediate key. Send btc to the address, and the intermediate key to the receiver. Then the receiver can combine the two keys to get the real private key to withdraw the coins.

It's difficult to buy Bitcoin with credit cards. When you buy something on a credit card, you can call the CC company and tell them you never got the product, and they will refund you the money.
With Bitcoin, it's very difficult for a seller to prove that they sent you the coins, and credit card companies basically always side with the buyer.
Virwox is an option, as mentioned, but the fees are really high.
I think your best bet would be localbitcoins.com or craigslist, offer to trade the card at face value to someone.

I just saw a thread with a link discussing fees for online payment processing in the UAE. Their providers all charge at least 5%, before monthly and setup fees.

Bitcoind/Bitcoinqt actually allow you to set up a callback script when an address inside the wallet receives a payment. So you would have the webpage open up a socket to the server, and as soon as that callback script is run, it'll notify the user of received payment.
Unfortunately, the possible downside is that all the payment addresses need to be stored within the bitcoind wallet, and I have yet to see any real testing/reports on how well it can handle thousands of individual addresses as the system runs over the course of a couple of years.
Ultimately, it's only a difference of a couple of seconds either way.

Buyback does exist.
It all depends on how the store runs it.
College bookstores tend to not hire much IT, so they often heavily rely on packaged solutions from vendors that roll the entire program into one system. Managing the supply and demand for a book, determining how much a book is worth at a given moment, and where that bookstore should send it to be resold (since not all buyback books go back on the shelf at the same school). This is a lot easier for stores to manage if they don't have to deal with those logistics.
In some schools, the money is handled by the actual store, so they pay you out of their own account, then bill the buyback vendor for those books. (Minus the ones that they keep for themselves)
In other stores, it's the other way around, where you're given the vendor's money, and the bookstore ships away what it doesn't want and pays the vendor back for what it does. (This is easier for accounting because the store doesn't have this new type of transaction that's always a refund, them gets offset a month later. They just buy what they keep as if they bought it from any other publisher, and ship away the rest without having to deal with it because it never goes through the regular till or inventory).
So if a store is implementing the second system, they're really at the mercy of what the vendor will offer for refunds. And with the first system, volatility is an issue as always, since the store might not get the dollars back for those books for a few weeks.

BIP38 wouldn't solve the problem OP is having.
OP wants to give/send bitcoins to someone without that transaction appearing on the bitcoin network, and without knowing the receiver's private key. (or vice versa, wants to receive off the blockchain without risk of fraud)
BIP38 would allow a sender to encrypt a private key to give to OP, but the sender would still know the key. (or OP could create his own key and give the address to the sender to send coins to, but then that's on the blockchain)

I think ultimately, the general population prefers to secure their stuff with a face and a paper signature rather than passwords they can't remember and key files that they'll lose.
Banks allow their members to not have to think about passwords or backing up hard drives. They walk in, show an ID, say a simple password, and get their money. If the bank gives the money away to someone else accidentally, then it's on them and you get it back.
The beauty of bitcoin is that you're not forced to keep your money in a bank though. At any time, you can withdraw and spend it in digital form or just manage it yourself. Unlike current banks where your options are to go get cash, or hope that your bank supports whatever digital payment processing system the merchant supports (and pays lots of money for).
@_date: 2014-01-20 15:53:14
I think the idea with this is that the government is creating their own system of managing funds in a digital form.
Currently, for you to have "digital" Canadian dollars, that value is only managed by and accessible through a bank. If you want to digitally send that money somewhere, you have to jump through hoops. Interac email transfers are a step in that direction, but that depends on a private company continuing to offer the service and not hiking their rates up.
With this (ideally), you can withdraw the funds into your government-managed digital money wallet, and deposit it into any other wallet (or bank), hopefully without high fees.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:51:38
Technically it's just the wallet software that is modified to tack on a lower fee than it used to.
But the chances of your transaction making it into a block is based on what everyone else is paying. So if you're paying less than everyone else, it will take longer for you to get included in a block.
Since this is a hard-coded change into one of the major Bitcoin wallets, a large proportion of users will now (by default) pay a lower fee, so everyone else can also pay a lower fee and still get included in blocks.
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:07:11
You can attach messages to the actual content of a bitcoin transaction. I don't think any of the current wallets have it built in as a GUI feature though, you have to use the command line.

I haven't read up on it in a while, but basically,
Namecoin lets you assign and manage Domain names through coins. So you can connect a namecoin to a domain (like mywebsite.name), and other people that have appropriate software installed (the namecoin DNS proxy) can go to mywebsite.name and see your website. Currently, domain names are assigned and managed be central parties, so they can be seized, shut down, etc, just like bank accounts. Namecoin adds the magic and security of bitcoins to domain names, where there's a blockchain that cannot be changed without the privkeys, and everyone checks the blockchain for accurate data. The hope is that isp's will start running their own DNS servers so that all their clients can access .name websites.
I don't know much about zerocoin, but I believe it's just like bitcoin, but with some alterations that make it possible to have coins in a wallet *without* showing who sent them. So there's no taint trail where you can see where coins from a certain address came from and went.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:02:39
In general, yes.
The only caveat is that some exchanges might not process BTC withdrawals right away (perhaps if they batch together a bunch of them and run them as a single transaction to save on fees). In that case, you'd have to wait until the exchange sends the coins on the bitcoin network, then it's an hour from there. (from what I remember, CaVirtex does BTC withdrawals instantly, but my info is 6 months old so I might be wrong)

I don't know anybody else that owns Bitcoins, but I would assume so, it's much quicker than any other method, and fairly cheap.
Nobody really knows what the reasoning behind banks closing accounts is, but they only close the cash deposit accounts, not the cold-storage or direct deposit accounts. My guess is that they don't want to pay for the tellers' time to do all those deposits because they're not a storefront for these exchanges.

I'm not specifically defending them, but I disagree on "it's hard to tell a DDOS from public opinion"
A DDOS can come in the way of DNS reflection attacks, SYN attacks, or just mass-pinging. Yes, it's possible to set up bots to request the actual website until it crashes, but that would require the bots establish TCP connections. It's more much economical and powerful to either just mass-send data to that server with pings, and use DNS reflection to multiply whatever botnet power you may have. Both of those methods show up as very different things from real traffic in network logs.

FYI, most hosting providers use the WHCMS software to manage billing/account setup/support, etc.
WHCMS generates an invoice x days before the payment is due and sends it to the client, if the client pays it before the due date, service continues. If they forget, WHCMS disables their account/service. Simple as that.
Overall, WHCMS has a very robust API, so providers can choose to integrate things like PayPal recurring billing (so invoices get automatically paid) but obviously, that won't work for BTC.
But yeah, overall, users pre-pay for whatever length of service they want to subscribe to.

I would imagine that the best way to go about this would be to allow you to tie multiple addresses to each line item/wallet.
So in the send screen where you have "Kids college fund", it shows up as a single line item, but every single time you go to the receive tab and choose a wallet to receive to, it will generate a new address, tie it to that wallet, and save it under that name.
Then when you send, if someone selects more than one "From" wallet, it pops up a warning dialog box that explains the dangers of typing accounts together.
Then, as an option, allow users to create a CSV export of all addresses (possibly with privkeys). So column one would be the wallet name (which would appear in a bunch of rows), col 2 would be address, etc.
How are you storing your database? I was trying to get a Bitcoin app going with C# but wasted many hours trying to get SQLite to behave, then realized that SQLite doesn't automatically work across platforms(with Mono), so I just started again in Python, where things are easier. Have you tried running your app through Mono so it's cross-compatible?

Assuming you buy at market, (ie, you tell the exchange to buy at whatever the cheapest rate offered is at that moment), it should only take a second or two. You can also set a limit order, which means that you request say, 1btc at $1000, then that trade will sit and wait until someone offers to sell coins at $1000, and your trade will go through then.
Once you have your coins on exchange a, when you go to withdraw them (to the deposit address of another exchange), that transaction should appear on the bitcoin network almost instantly. But most exchanges require you to wait until you have 6 confirmations on your transaction, which takes about one hour. (It depends on exactly when blocks are mined each block is one confirmation. They should be mined every 10 minutes, but sometimes one take longer, other times, it's faster, because it's based on probability)
6 confirmations is a mathematically deduced number at which point it is absolutely virtually impossible to reverse the transaction. (Before the, it's still possible but VERY expensive, and becomes more expensive when more people mine because to do so, an attacker must hold more than 50% of the mining power. (It's possible to reverse with as little as 34% of the power, but the chances of sucvess are much smaller))
tl;dr, As long as the exchanges aren't bogged down or holding things back, you can go from fiat-btc-fiat on another exchange in around an hour and 10 mins.

It would work for micropayments as others have said, but most networks rely on a subscription model, and bitcoin cannot do that natively.

With bitcoin, someone has to send money/pay the bill manually every month or two, so it's actually easier to not pay and have the company cancel the account.)

The key stays safe,  but how do you know what/where the merchant's terminal is sending money? 
Sure,  there's a screen that shows the balance to pay and where it's going to.  But it's totally trivial to show one number on a display,  and send another number to the card. So you see 1BTC, but the transaction goes through for 10. And he got it spot on about Visa/Mastercard that can stop or later reverse transactions,  but not btc.

Yeah,  I'm not quite sure what point op is trying to make. 
He had savings. He cashed out those savings. He went to her bank and deposited that cash into her account. 
The fact that the savings were in btc is irrelevant, and the trip to western union wasn't necessary of op could have just done the transfer. (perhaps he didn't know that he could transfer until after the western union troubles,  but that still doesn't explain bit coin's involvement aside from just being savings.)

BitPay doesn't show up in the official docs, but BitPay published their own open source implementation since WHCMS is open to plugins:

If you're using bitcoin-qt, you actually have 117 because it generates lots for you to send change to after a transaction.

It was "bitcoin-bought-gold" at first, but that didn't sounds right.

The media night be getting confused since virtex is the Canadian exchange, so why wouldn't bitcoiniacs trade there?

The government can't touch your coins (which is the point of btc), but they can still legally mess your life up and put you in prison for gaining money (in any way) without paying the taxes on it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:58:08
Yeah,  but we can hope that another exchange actually does something about it. Gox have proven themselves incompetent on multiple occasions now.

I don't think that the issue with the machines had to do with FinTrac, it was probably more of a vending machine/ATM licensing issue.
That being said, this is good. It means that the people that regulate money, will not be regulating bitcoin. (For now)

Presumably we know some of the addresses that SR uses (by looking at block chain records of people that sent money to SR and where the money went from there) and a lot/nearly all of it has now ended up in that one address.

The whole doge thing is getting super old (my girlfriend and I have been beating the joke deep, deep, into the ground) but for some reason, that got a really good laugh out of me. (I think "so decentral" got me the most)

That doesn't change the fact that they get 75% roi... (asicminer) 
I'm sure that will change with time,  but for now,  that's the case.

Check again,
They've been warning and removing nearly anything that has to do with bitcoin, not just direct transaction processors.

I really hope libertybit picks up,  Cavirtex really sucks with those fees but they're my best option for getting money into btc.

For Canadians:
Cash deposit at a bank: $3, 2-4 hours. (This is what I do, despite the crappy fees, it's still cheaper than a Wire Transfer to Mt.Gox)
Online bill payment: Free, 3-5 business days (requires verification)
Direct withdraw from bank account:  Free, 3-5 business days (requires verification)
Trading fee: 3% on all trades (boo!) goes down to 2.5 after 100BTC volume.
Cash deposit: $3 per $1000 deposit, 2-8 hours.
Wire transfers $15-$20 (+ your bank's fee), 3-5 days.
Email Money Transfer: $2 (+sending fee from your bank) 24-36 hours
0.6% trading fee
Also, watch out for [Toronto Bitcoin Exchange]( they're in beta now (testnet), but their trading interface looks stellar, and the owner says they plan on undercutting most/all other exchanges' fees (within reason)
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:34:01
Yeah, you can (ad the other user mentioned, it's called arbitrage)
You just buy your coins on virtex, go to the withdraw page, and and the "deposit" address of your gox account.
But it'll rake an hour for them to confirm before you can sell them, and like he said, getting money out of fox is quite difficult, so you'd be tying up your fiat for up to a couple of weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:45:46
I think what will end up happening is somebody will put out an easy-to-use bitcoin "network" (just like Visa is today, just in terms of debit instead of credit)
Clients of participating banks will get cards that have their unique account numbers on them which tie to their actual BTC wallets that the bank holds. Merchants will get card readers and software that integrates with this system. So when you go make a purchase, the system tells the bank to initiate the actual BTC transfer. (then the bank can also provide security by denying large purchases and things like that)
I sure hope BTC doesn't turn into this, but it seems like the most probably route, and doesn't really solve the fees issue.
Sure you'll still have your personal wallet, but if most of the merchants you shop with use this network to accept BTC, they may not bother setting up a regular payment address because the bank method is more secure and concise.

As far as I'm aware, the official client (bitcoin-qt/bitcoind) is specifically designed to be the reference client for the full network. Releasing an SPV option would go against their philosophy at this time.
I can see them releasing an SPV client when they finalize the procedures for trimming the blockchain though. (when they finalize how to run a full node that can perfectly verify all transactions in real-time without having to download the entire chain)
Right now, the current SPV clients do not act as nodes, they just request specific information about the specific data that they're interested in, but they don't share anything back or contribute to passing general/non-wallet transactions around or verifying them.

Assuming you're using WHMCS for billing, there's a totally super handy payment processor module, so you hardly have to do anything aside from set up an account with bitpay!

I guess I just meant your own computer, not necessarily a server.
If they can pwn your wallet, they can pwn your 2fa, basically.

It's not the width,  but she elements shrink down to mobile resolution (like the background) while others stay at full size.

Yeah, op has it right.
Bitcointip opens up a blockchain.info wallet for each account, so when you tip someone it just sends the coins via the blockchain.

Basically, the return is heavily dependent on the difficulty.
The difficulty is a number that's agreed-to by the Bitcoin network that changes depending on how many people are mining and how fast blocks are being mined. (This is recalculated every 2016 blocks, which should take exactly 2 weeks. If the blocks were mined faster, then difficulty goes down, if slower, then it goes up)
At the current difficulty and exchange rates, it will take about 12 days to break even. (There are lots of online calculators to help you figure it out,  is one of them)
HOWEVER: Chances are that by the time you actually get this, many other people will already have their ASICs, so the difficulty will be much higher. It's set to recalculate in a couple days, and so far the predicted increase is around 25% higher than the current difficulty.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:43:36
From what I've seen in this thread so far, rates that are better than most other exchanges (within reason) and better funding options.

A pgp hash confirms the publisher of the hash as well as the integrity of the software.
If someone gets into the web server and replaces the wallet installer with their own, it's trivial for them to also replace the sha hash. A pgp hash/signature, on the other hand, depends on the file being identical AND having the appropriate private key available, which a hacker generally wouldn't have.
Generally the idea is that you grab the author's fingerprint from a "trusted" source (so maybe if you see the same fingerprint published by the author in a number of places early on, you can trust it). Then you tell the gpg software how much you trust the fingerprint when you load it in for that author. Then you can just point gpg at a file, it will find the corresponding fingerprint and let you know of there's a discrepancy. (It will also warn you if you indicated that you don't really trust that fingerprint yet, in which case you can go see if you can find it published elsewhere to confirm that it's right)
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:13:50
The only way is if they eventually move the funds to an address that's known to belong to an exchange (maybe by where they go after the person's done moving them), and the exchange cooperates to find out who it was that moved the money in to begin with. I don't think they would do so though because for all they know, OP could be lying and just wants to keep both the (hypothetical) car and the BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:41:30
Well if anything, $70 is great, because it shows that Bitcoin ban be used for large and small sums alike.
With the current methods, a wire transfer costs you $20 no matter how much you're sending. Spending a third of my money on fees is the last thing I'd want to do.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:54:49
I think this right here is the reason that "no fees" is an invalid pro for btc. 
Sure there are no fees now,  when just the nerds are using it and can figure their way around it. 
But as soon as the general population gets involved,  they're going to want a nanny (bank) to explain every last detail and keep things secure (for both the merchants and the consumers) . Does everyone truly think this will come for free?

How much luck/success have you had paying your bills or buying stock with bitcoin?
I'm glad that you guys are definitely trying, but I'm curious if anybody upstream of you is doing the same.
