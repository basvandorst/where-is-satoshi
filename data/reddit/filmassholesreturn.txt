Looks like shit. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:03:12
Like I've been saying, all these companies that accept bitcoin and sell it right back for fiat are going to continue driving the price down.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:44:03
People sleep on peercoin because it's dying... but I'm still holding. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:10:58
It looks disgustingly delicious.

Merchant adoption should be the enemy.

Stop making sense!

Kangaroo court.
@_date: 2014-09-09 01:17:31
Let's be honest though, there's a very high probability that bitcoin's price bubbled as high as it will ever go last January-ish.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:01:31
They're co-oping something that was supposed to destroy them. And this subreddit loves it.
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:03:18
Fundamentals don't mean shit for the price though. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:04:03
Ah, denial.
@_date: 2014-10-09 00:21:29
Once again I couldn't give two shits about this clown.
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:23:02
Well there's plenty of sell pressure with all the bigger companies accepting bitcoin and selling it right away.
@_date: 2014-10-05 03:04:08
Or the price of bitcoin is naturally collapsing...
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:45:20
Lol, unfortunately buying bitcoin isn't simple or quick. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:56:06
Hey man, let me tell you something about the MicroKorg. It kicks ass. I bought one when I was right out of high school. Only used the presets because I couldn't figure out the fairly insane way of making my own sounds. 
Then one day I read through the manual. And although it's a little tricky to operate via the tiny 3 letter LED screen, you really need to learn how to unleash it's true power. Also, you can download lots of other presets online and control it with a usb to midi cord. 
Motherfucker is amazing. Congrats!
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:48:42
I'm optimistic about bitcoin's future as well. But you're in serious denial if you can't entertain the idea that bitcoin could end up worthless. It may be a great technology, but the value of a bitcoin is intrinsically worthless without proper support.

So fucking sick of hearing about this fucking movie on this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:45:39
Who gives a fuck about Ray Rice? 
@_date: 2014-09-21 16:31:21
Why would bitcoin's price be bullish? You realize that all these big companies accepting bitcoin sell their bitcoin for cash. The more companies that do this, the more the price will fall unless people start buying way more bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-18 15:38:27
I meant, what was the outcome of this legal threat. Did he buy it or tell them to fuck off?
@_date: 2014-09-27 23:44:38
Wow, I hadn't thought about this for a long time. Read up on it again, and it turns out the dad died a few years ago. Damn.
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:01:13
The whole fucking point of bitcoin is to replace scammy money skimmers like paypal. Lots of people on this subreddit have a really bizarre rational toward companies accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-19 00:08:31
Maybe worse than Karaples. I think Karaples was just an idiot, this Green guy is a straight up scammer.
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:44:22
Does nobody see the irony in this? It's a day when everyone is encouraged to sell their bitcoins. I guess it's an apt name since a big influx of coins being sold by these companies taking advantage of bitiots will end up on the exchanges. Hopefully it's huge and crashes the price so everyone will learn their lesson.
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:00:19
You are delusional.
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:28:53
Bitcoin got you down? It's time to quit crypto.

Not pushing 700 anymore lololol.
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:38:48
Isn't the website name enough to convince you not to do business with them?
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:44:01
Yeah but silkroad was an online marketplace.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:37:16
You'll lose your all your money investing in altcoins! Instead, lose all your money investing in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:00:01
Lol, bitcoin in the shitter? Yup, but let's ignore this and shit on altcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:21:35
I can't lol enough. Maybe 99% of altcoins are shitcoins, but some of them are faster, more anonymous, and more environmentally friendly than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:11:46
A random guy giving some other random guy 5btc was the best thing I've seen all day! You're a good man!
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:20:05
Wall street speculators make their money buying stocks that they feel are undervalued and due for a rise. The question is, do you think Bitcoin is currently under or overvalued? Although I really want the price to go up, truth is that it's probably still overvalued.
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:46:01
Honestly cash is easiest with dispensaries. I've been to a few that accept credit cards, but think of the clientele, hippies, degenerates, and some medical patients. It's not the online tech crowd buying the majority of weed.
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:25:04
Or it they haven't sold all the bitcoins yet.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:45:15
Great post.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:23:21
Is the blockchain really 40gb? Jebus.
@_date: 2015-08-26 02:00:35
People downvote the truth unfortunately. How about instead of denying bitcoin's problems we start focusing on solutions?
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:27:32
Next dip under $250 and I'll take a trip up to Noho.
@_date: 2015-08-09 02:27:23
I see this a lot. I think a lot of time people put up huge orders like this to give people fake confidence so they'll buy into their sell orders.
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:10:57
Lol, SCAM. First of all, the idea that there are different "levels" of your doctor's recommendation is bullshit. I can walk down the street to a mmj doctor and pay $40 cash and meet with a real doctor and get a rec which covers smoking, growing, buying. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:30:35
Anybody got a link where I can pirate this shit? 
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:41:32
You'll be homeless in 6 months unless you have rich parents. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:31:30
The fast, expensive and dirty way I've used is an old one that still works. Virwox.com. You can use paypal to buy SLL, then trade SLL for BTC. But you get pretty fucked on the transfer with paypal, then you get fucked again buying SLL, and finally get fucked trading SLL for BTC. Then again, for such a small amount if you're just looking for a quick way to buy, it may be worth it.
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:35:50
Yeah, back when bitcoin was young, exciting and promising. Now it's more like a trainwreck.

Because bitcoin don't pay the rent.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:16:02
same with lots of other alts
@_date: 2015-08-09 00:45:26
I mean realistically I think it's proving that the tech behind bitcoin is the game changer. Bitcoin barely useful because of how fucking long it takes for confirmation. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:37:22
I mean, realistically, why would any business accept bitcoin if they don't sell it immediately for cash? And selling it immediately for cash sort of defeats the purpose.
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:59:02
They want to make money?
@_date: 2015-07-24 02:42:41
I'll give you .1 BTC for it.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:49:19
214.14 USD
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:44:08
No, the only real justification for piracy is that anything that's just a file that can be transferred over the internet has no inherent value and you're a fool to pay for it.
@_date: 2015-08-11 16:37:01
Haha, this is all so fucking stupid. Bitcoin is fucking up.
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:45:38
Haha, saying that your moral compass needs adjusting for supporting piracy is like saying your moral compass needs adjusting for supporting bitcoin. In fact, bitcoin is a lot more morally questionable than piracy with the darknet markets and what not.
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:44:22
Trade fees down, but withdrawing fees have skyrocketed.

@_date: 2015-04-08 15:52:49
Of course it could fail.
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:09:10
And unbroken.
@_date: 2015-03-20 02:28:41
Haha because bitcoin is doing see well since it was pumped and dumped.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:50:23
It can be called The Fall and Fall of Bitcoin.

More money has been lost on bitcoin than to shitcoins.
