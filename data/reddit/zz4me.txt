I have no idea, but do know that the CFTC has subpoenaed documents from Tether.

Doesn't seem to have stopped Tether....

Here is what will likely happen if the CFTC or SEC brings the hammer down:  Those who hold tether will head for the exits.  There are three exit paths: Tether Limited, Kraken, and other crypto.  I doubt Tether Limited will be jumping up to hand out $2.2 billion, so that leaves Kraken and other crypto.  The market has every appearance of being rigged on Kraken, but you can't hold back the ocean with a broom, so Kraken will be flooded with sell orders, and either the price will collapse to almost nothing, or they'll halt trading, which will probably have the same effect.  My guess is that they'll just let it slide.  That leaves other crypto.  Tether holders will try to immediately trade into other crypto, and prices will probably spike initially.  However, people aren't completely stupid, and pretty quickly no one will trade their crypto for Tether.  Because about 20% of bitcoin trading is done in Tether, a huge chunk of potential bitcoin buyers immediately evaporate.  People who hold crypto will recognize this and sell, triggering a massive sell-off.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the crypto markets cut in half, or worse.  Moreover, the stink of this fraud will damage the perception of crypto, and the markets will be in a funk for quite some time.  Think Mt. Gox, but worse.  
This of course is just one man's opinion.

Well, the Tether situation will eventually decimate the crypto markets, but in the short term they've transferred $200M to the main wallet, so it looks like they're going to be stabilizing/manipulating the price upward.  I doubt they'll get it anywhere near $16K though.
