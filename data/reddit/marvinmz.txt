I don't think we know yet where the actual fuckup happened, but either way it's bitfinex's fault for not securing the funds properly by themselves. Mantaining a (let's say 2 of 3) multisig offline wallet for cold storage is not rocket science.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:52:35
If it's by design you are able to steal 80 mio $ than that's incompetence. They shouldn't have that much in a hot wallet. Blaming bitgo that they didn't secure their funds is just as incompetent, since they could have easily done that themselves.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:58:00
I don't know what to say. They must have known the additional risk they are taking by (blindly) trusting another service with the money. If they didn't have the knowhow to implement it themselves they should've just stuck with what they had.

It's silly to think the only way to make a profit is by mining by the rules. Why wouldn't you be able to short the price in which case it is in your best interest to disrupt as mush as possible? There are probably a million other reasons for different entities to cause harm to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-06 10:40:53

A hot wallet is a wallet that is connected to the internet as opposed to a cold wallet that is kept entirely offline - an encrypted bitcoin core wallet running on a computer with an internet connection is also a hot wallet. This has very little to do with *(online) shared wallets*, which is what coinbase is. Note that exchanges all use both hot and cold wallets in their systems.
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:40:20
It'll be fine. Each input is 180 bytes so you'll have to pay about 140 satoshi/byte * 180 bytes = 25200 satoshis  = 0.000252 BTC per input. If every input is at least 0.01 btc that means you'll be paying 2.52% in fees.
@_date: 2017-02-07 12:48:33


I have not said it is wrong, but it is misleading because you're implying that the fees needed to be paid are low. They aren't, not for the general public.
Sure, it works fine if I want to transfer all my savings from one wallet to another. It does not work fine if I want to actually use it and pay for a $10 steam game.

@_date: 2017-02-07 12:21:56
This is misleading as fee does not depend on actual value of the transaction. Many transactions can't pay *only 0.03% fee* - actually at the moment that would mean a transaction of at least 580 usd in value.

It could skew the fee calculation algorithms as such transactions wouldn't be a part of it - making the required fee too low.

Blockchain.info are terrible when it comes to security and they have had several faults in the past. If you can afford to run a full node then bitcoin core would be best, otherwise some of the well known SPV wallets - electrum, multibit.

Finding the best price is not difficult but most of users won't be able to actually use it because in a lot of cases it's not actually the best option when considering other fees - for example, for anyone in europe us based exchange is completely out of the question as wiring money overseas includes massive fees.
@_date: 2017-02-04 08:06:59
I only quickly scanned their website but from what I gather there's no reason to user bitkey, you can use any wallet that supports signing transactions offline, there are a few - electrum, armory, and probably more.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:03:10
Please reconsider and install a desktop wallet - I suggest electrum. Having bitcoin in a blockchain.info wallet is a terrible idea.

@_date: 2017-02-09 08:50:16
I don't think that's even a problem. There is no concise direction on what block the miners should build on. When creating a block with [the median EB]( value this with some luck will split the miners down the middle. When BU people are asked about this they defend it by saying that from a game theoretic view it's not profitable for people to do that, never taking into account the incentives not directly relying on the mining profits, e.g. someone wanting to disrupt bitcoin paying them to do it. The main issue is that the BU developers don't seem to want to fix whatever is wrong with their algorithm and keep shoving is down our throats as is - [there have also been some other concers]( that have not been addressed.
I for one am not dismissing the BU idea out of the gate, but some things clearly need to be fixed.
@_date: 2016-06-02 07:59:56
Depends on how much bitcoin you're getting
* if it's dollars worth then electrum
* if it's hundreds of dollars worth then invest $20 into a ledger wallet
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:44:30
To be honest if you're not sure you have a clean computer it might be safer to leave them at coinbase for a few days until you get your ledger.
Otherwise you can download a [live ubuntu image]( and electrum (put that on a separate usb), create a bootable [usb]( or cd, unplug internet, boot into live ubuntu, install electrum from usb, initialize the wallet and copy the encrypted wallet back on your usb, then restart your computer before plugging the internet back in. That should keep you pretty safe.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:53:36

Ledger hw1, it's about 20 bucks. Worth every cent. Not very sturdy though so if you need something you can throw in your bag go for the nano or higher.
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:13:40
If I were you I'd probably keep them there until you get your ledger. There's no difference apart from the design - nano is a bit more sturdy so easier to carry around.
Also make sure you skim through their [faq](
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:05:58
Get yourself a hardware wallet. Depending on how much money you have to protect, $20 for ledger hw1 or $100 for a trezor is probably worth it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:46:05
Then go right ahead, but you should do that *every time* you're going to create a transaction. Your keys/master password should never touch a system that is online after that. If you don't mind the extra time it takes to do that then you're ready to go.

HW.1 and nano are basically the same hardware minus the nicer enclosure. If you're not going to be wearing it on your keychain then I don't think nano is worth the higher price.
I had HW.1 till recently (swapped it for trezor which is a bit more secure) and it worked flawlessly.
Like you I have also used armory with a dedicated offline computer, I'm never going back to that again.

This is why if you're doing it the way you said you really want to boot into a live linux and print it from there. If your computer is infected then being offline at the time of creating the wallet won't do much - as soon as you're back online someone can have your seed.
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:10:44
It looks like you somehow send to an address that's not generated by your seed. Your best bet is probably to try your recovery phrase in a client like electrum.

make sure you do it offline **and** on a clean system - for example boot into live ubuntu when not connected to the internet, print (or preferrably write down) the wallet seed then reboot before reconnecting to the internet again.
For $500 it might be worth investing $20 into a ledger hw.1.
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:42:17
Which is *exactly* how pretty much all bitcoin thefts have happened. One of my friends lost about $30k worth because they hacked his email. They absolutely knew what they were looking for.

The secure element which stores your keys can never be touched from the outside, meaning no malware on your computer can ever get hold of your private keys. Wallet puts the unsigned transaction to the device, the secure element takes it and signs it and reports back. At no point any information of your private keys is leaked to your computer. With a usb drive the communication goes both ways, whatever is on it you can see from your computer.

I see so many posts like this lately. I don't understand. If your computer is infected, being offline for the time of wallet creation won't do a thing, even if you restart your computer in between. Malware will just save whatever it gets and report back when your system is back online. 
If you want to do it securely, you need a clean os, either a dedicated offline computer or booting into something like live linux (offline of course) just for creating a wallet. This is where all of that gets terribly inconvenient and spending a few bucks for a hardware wallet might be worth less than your time.

No, it doesn't rely on them to function. Both ledger and trezor work with variaty of different wallets, some online (greenaddress), some offline (electrum, copay). All code is also open source so it's always going to be available to dissect and create new tools to work with those devices. If all things fail (which they won't) you can always import the seed to any bip32 compatible wallet.
If you truly want to be safe(r) it's this or having a dedicated offline computer just to sign transactions - and that's a giant pain in the ass.

Ugh, don't addresses don't match. The address on blockexplorer is 14QdgVc9ERPUbUgNTMeWDhzMEFhuKs9gua and the address in your screenshot is 14vP.... - you sent to the wrong address, I don't know where you got that one from.
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:31:37
This is why I used quotation marks with the same term averyone else uses for this entity. All this current situation shows is that bitcoin needs to scale soon and scale much better than just increasing the block size.
Also let us calculate what this "pot to piss in" actually means - if we are willing to pay 10 cents per transaction for fees, at the maximum rate of 7.5 transactions per second that would mean a sustained "attack" would need to pay at least $0.75 per second in fees, which is about $60000 per day.
@_date: 2016-11-05 12:30:14
It needs to download the block headers first (about 34 megabytes of data).

This is excellent, thank you! Amazing work as always.
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:31:45
Except visas payment channel is not directly tied to bitcoin thus it's a misleading comparison.
@_date: 2016-11-23 09:10:06


In this case even if clients only do one transaction as long as they don't have a direct connection to alice via a channel those tiny transaction will likely be joined along the way over different channel paths.


Probably not soon, especially if segwit doesn't get activated.
Unfortunately bitcoin in its current state is just not a good fit for microtransactions.

Yes, of course there are 'dangers of accidental loss', because no one is having control over your own money but yourself. If you lose the key you can't access your bitcoins. I think that makes perfect sense, doesn't it? If you're not capable of backing up a wallet then you really shouldn't use bitcoin at all.

The only difference would come from the transaction fees though, so probably not much more if any as the blocks are nearly full already.

I'm pretty sure you can use sendrawtransaction with the transaction that you want to add to your mempool and it should be added. You can get the raw transaction from blockchain.info's [api]( like [this](
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:48:18
Your transaction pays 16 satoshis/byte, which is very low. I don't think it will ever confirm. If you own private keys to some of the outputs you can use CPFP to get it confirmed - but make sure you use at least 90 satoshis/byte of fees. I also suggest you switch to a wallet that uses dynamic fees.

@_date: 2016-11-20 16:43:55
Just spend the funds that were sent to you and use high fee for the transaction. This won't work if the other double spend tx is already confirmed though, which seems likely if it was 1 day ago.
@_date: 2016-11-05 07:48:39
Do you have a transaction id? Does it show up on blockchain.info? Do you have the address you sent to in the list of addresses in the multibit wallet? If all of those are a 'yes' then your money is not gone.

It's going to be exactly like the last time at one point. People are too greedy not to jump in and try to make a quick buck - it'll start with euphoria and end in panic. This behavior (bubble cycles) isn't bitcoin specific though, but bitcoin doesn't have the volume to even things out.

Wouldn't a much better way of doing things be to deacrease the number of on-chain transactions? Then we wouldn't be faced with a potentially gigantic blockchain size as the block size would be pretty irrelevant.

Since HD wallets addresses are very rarely reused so most of the time it would take both ECDSA *and* RIPEMD-160 to be broken - which is also why quantum computing is not as scary a threat as people often make it.

More importantly fixed numbers make everything predictable.
Increasing/decreasing block size is just a temporary fix. Bitcoin needs to scale much, much better than what a blocksize increase would provide. (Unless I'm completely wrong and this whole post wasn't whining about the block size, I've read the post three times and I'm still not sure what the OP is trying to say.)

Some probably are, most are not. It really depends on the equipment and electricity cost.
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:31:42
One way is to leverage what you're paying in fees by shorting bitcoin and hoping the price drops as panic sets in. There are also probably people with more bitcoin than they can ever spend and incentive to be disruptive.
Note that these kind of "attacks" are always a possibility. Even if we remove the blocksize limit altogether someone with enough money and incentive will still be able to flood the network so that only his transactions get confirmed.
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:44:18
I don't understand what you are trying to say or how it relates to anything I said.
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:37:48
because hard forks are not easy and theres a high chance bigger blocks won't be needed since bitcoin can scale much better in other ways. 
My opinion is that segwit provides us with enough of an increase for quite some time and if more is needed we can hard fork then, but there's no need to rush things.
If they want a fork they can contribute the codr themselves - the reason they want core to fo it for them is because probably very few people would download it, even if the mining majority is for it. This itself is manipulation of the public.
@_date: 2016-11-03 10:10:00


I would love to do that, and I do use it wherever I can, but unfortunately the only thing I can really buy with btc in my country is beer. I can't live off beer alone so there's that. I would love to hear in what utopian country you live in so I can move there as well.

Not really. As long as it's not physically disconnected from the network it's open to exploits and is in no way comparable to the hardware wallets. Stating "it's an offline wallet, *but* it uses internet to communicate with the bitcoin network!" is ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:13:58
Yes, and that's exactly what a LN transaction is. Just because it's not broadcasted immediately doesn't make it *not* a bitcoin transaction. Eventually the tx is broadcasted because channels are timelocked. You seem to be either trolling or you don't understand how LN work.
@_date: 2016-11-21 07:16:47


There is no encryption in bitcoin. It only uses hash160, sha256 and ecdsa, which is a signing protocol.


Properly used bitcoin is not affected by QC because hash functions are fairly QC resistant (or so we think at the moment). The only bitcoins vulnerable are those that have already broadcasted their public address. Mining is based on sha256 so QC won't help, and even if it would the difficulty would just adjust itself to the new hashrate.
@_date: 2016-11-05 08:28:22
Multibit is an spv wallet, it only needs to download 34 megabytes of data all in all. Your internet is fine. If after a resync the funds aren't there then you didn't send them to an address that is in that wallet.

Fair enough, but then this whole notion of consensus doesn't fit into bitcoin at all because it's contradicted by the protocol itself, unless it's somehow moved off chain.
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:47:09
There's actually no need to do that. You can just double spend and when that gets confirmed the other transaction will automatically be removed. This works with all clients (that allow you to double spend) too. This is also what RBF does.
Also I'm pretty sure a large majority doesn't use the bitcoin core wallet anymore.
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:52:49
They're also notoriously bad with their wallet security. I wouldn't trust them with *any* amount of bitcoins until they add hw wallets support.
@_date: 2016-11-15 08:44:31
Of course. But what I'm trying to say is the 95% is completely irrelevant. If (only) 50% of the miners decide they really want segwit they will get it and the 95% threshold can do absolutely nothing about it. It's the equivalent of needing 50% to be elected president, having less than 50% support but having the power to deny everybody that disagrees with you from voting and thus getting 100% of the votes. If anything the high ceiling is promoting something like that to happen.
@_date: 2016-12-01 10:15:51
You're saying the address in your wallet is the same as the addres some charity has specified? [It would not be the first time several people generated the same private key]( **please, do not use blockchain.info wallet!** They were also removed from bitcoin.org because of their incompetence.
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:56:44

It would most likely never confirm.
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:14:43
Ultimately it's up to the miners. If 51% of them really want segwit they will get it if the 95% threshold is there or not. If we really wanted to enforce the 95% the voting would need to be blind.

@_date: 2016-11-24 22:04:34


Your transaction only pays 12.8 satoshis/byte of fees. With the current situation you would need around 70. That is extremely low. It looks like your wallet doesn't use dynamic fees so I would suggest you change it for one that does.
If your wallet permits you can send from one of the outputs in this transaction to yourself with a higher fee, so both transactions get confirmed.
@_date: 2016-12-24 14:29:22

@_date: 2016-11-03 09:51:55
Rigged or not, I can dump 500 bitcoins this very moment on bitstamp and the transaction will go through. I love the idea of a decentralized market, but unfortunately this one in the current state is of very limited use.
@_date: 2016-11-13 20:13:16
True. Pruned nodes can't send history blocks like full nodes with complete history, they however still validate every incoming transaction.
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:41:11
If they ~~aren't confirmed~~ don't compete with other transactions then they have no real impact. Look at [this]( - there are 17000 transactions with a low fee (10-20 satoshis/byte), once higher paying fees get cleared those won't have much of an impact since such low fee has been too low for a while now so everyone is paying more than that anyway.
@_date: 2016-11-15 06:21:04
I understand that and to a point I agree, but the protocol is designed in such a way that it really doesn't matter if it's 50% or a 100%. It's not even a lot of work for miners to achieve this, too. Taking that into account 95% just seems a ridiculously high number and might just hinder progress.
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:28:02

@_date: 2016-11-18 23:07:34
I don't know how many times this has to be re-stated before people get it: segwit is **NOT** about the blocksize increase - you don't "take a quick 2MB fork over this" because it's not a replacement for it.
@_date: 2016-12-01 09:07:37
I quoted you directly form the same link that it's not ready. Just because the code is there it doesn't mean it already works. You're making a fool out of yourself so do yourself a favor and stop.

@_date: 2016-11-19 06:29:25
I really don't understand this logic. Segwit gives us enough of an increase for the forseeable future. There's no need to block progress now because we'll *maybe* need a hard fork sometime in the distant future, when a million transactions per second is needed. We don't have that kind of base yet, maybe LN will provide us with enough scalling, maybe it won't. Why not worry when it actually comes to that.
@_date: 2016-11-15 09:35:37


Yep. Because this is how bitcoin was designed. Unless they somehow move voting off the chain it's all part of the game.
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:22:02
These are very specific type of transactions with a lot of witness data and are in no way comparable to the transactions you see in the main chain.
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:36:13
This is correct. Note that we don't actually need EC crypto if we *ban* reusing addresses - bitcoins can just be sent to a hash of a random number and used by providing the number.
There is also lattice crypto that is (supposedly) quantum resistant and bitcoin could use instead of EC.

@_date: 2016-11-19 00:21:23
Dear god. There are **no channels** in segwit. Lightning network has **nothing to do** with segwit. The segragation in the name is because the data to *spend tx outputs* is segregated away from the transaction. (I don't know the details so I hope u/nullc will correct me if I'm wrong)
@_date: 2016-11-23 09:58:49
Apparently that's the problem, since they fear that the raw blocksize increase won't be needed if this passes. I'm pretty sure even if segwit proposal would not contain a blocksize increase they would still block it and try to force a hard fork with it.

@_date: 2016-11-24 22:49:11
No, the appropriate amount depends on the actual size of the transaction, not its value.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:31:24
Depends on the transaction. If the transaction is big enough then this kind of fee might be justified.
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:23:32
The fee is very low. The default lowest setting in electrum gives you an expected confirmation over 25 blocks. What probably happened is that bitcoin was hit with a wave of transactions that have a higher fee per kb than yours shortly after your transaction was broadcasted. Note that the fees estimates are for the current fee discribution on the network. If that changes the expected time for confirmation of unconfirmed transactions also changes.
That said this tx will probably confirm once the wave is over, or if you're in a hurry and have replace by fee enabled you can bump the fee.

@_date: 2016-11-11 21:42:59
Agreed. The million dollar question is if gaining decentralisation for some weakening in the security asics provide is worth it, which ultimately the market will decide. Obviously any such change will fork bitcoin so bitcoin will still remain bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-11-25 00:24:24
I think we misunderstand each other.

@_date: 2016-11-25 16:09:25
It's hard because the fee distribution is constantly changing. Nothing can predict the future - if you are unlucky enough that after you have broadcasted your transaction a ton of new transactions that pay a higher fee appear then they will have a priority.
@_date: 2016-12-01 09:02:24
If you actually just skimmed through the link before posting you would see:
thunder.network uses a commitment-transaction design that needs both CSV and Segregated Witness to be completed. Otherwise the payments are not enforceable on the blockchain and are bad promises at best."

@_date: 2016-12-09 09:43:39


Only the funding and closing of the channel is on-chain. Every transaction in between is squished together into one transaction that closes the channel. As such it allows bitcoin to actually properly scale.

It would have been prevented if you followed instructions that every wallet puts you through and created a backup of the seed. You managed to forget the password AND lose the seed, either one of those would've saved your funds. This is not a flaw in bitcoin, it's people being exceptionally lazy.

After you have your private key and installed electrum you create a wallet, **make sure you back up the 12 word seed**, then use Wallet -&gt; Private keys -&gt; Sweep. You paste the private key there and press Sweep - this will transfer funds from the address in your bitcoin core wallet to your newly created electrum wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-01 09:22:20
I do when I see people like you.
@_date: 2016-11-26 06:23:41
Ditto. Trezor is sitting next to my screen, only move it when I need it. And even if it magically disappears I have a backup that I can actually use with *pretty much every wallet out there*.


Then stick with hardware wallets, paper wallets, or completely offline wallets (electrum, armory).

How is a segwit transaction *not* on-chain?
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:15:30
There are a lot of transactions with a relatively high fee. You can use 'child pays for parent', which I already suggested.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:43:52
Trezor, because I don't trust anything that is connected to the internet.
@_date: 2016-12-01 09:21:44
Ok buddy, whatever you say, LOL.
@_date: 2016-12-01 09:10:33
It can't be alpha when it doesn't work. It says in the description it needs both CSV and segwit to work. There is no segwit yet, therefore it can't work at the moment.
@_date: 2016-11-24 08:47:35
if you are talking about the amount on the fee slider that shows fees per kilobyte, which is usually almost 5 times bigger than what your tx will pay as a fee.
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:46:51
Send the unconfirmed coins to yourself with a high fee and it should be ok.
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:13:25
Nope, not kidding.
@_date: 2016-11-15 06:41:34
I don't think it would ever come to that. I'm pretty sure if the majority (like the top 4 pools) made an announcement they're going to ignore blocks that don't vote for segwit the others would follow - out of sheer greed, because they'd be losing all the income and probably most if not all the hashrate. It's nice to think miners/mining pools are these entities with high morals that will stand their ground but for the most of them this is just business.
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:55:00
You'll have to hash this out with steam and/or bitpay. It's pretty obvious there's an error with processing such a transaction.
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:40:30
We were doing so well. This now just screams another wave of people trying to make a quick buck that will pump the price and then it will crash to a lot lower than we were before. Mark my words.
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:08:05
I'm pretty sure the last few day screwed over a lot of people like that. I think it's actually pretty easy for something like this to happen if you target a fee that is not high enough to get in the very next block.
@_date: 2016-11-14 21:53:34
I am genuinely interested why such a high ceiling has been chosen, because it makes sense that if it won't be reached and quite a bit over 50% of the network is pro segwit (which seems very likely) the miners might start colluding and ignoring the blocks that aren't voting for it, effectively reducing the number of transactions/second getting into the blockchain. The protocol is designed to allow that so I don't understand why they're going against that with this.
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:43:05
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:57:37
It's not worth mentioning 50 times every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:16:19
The expected time per block would increase to adjust for that - so expected reward remains the same.
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:16:59
See, this is the problem with people. Nobody would pay their taxes but they all use public infrastructure.
I'm pretty sure coinbase also has a list of your transactions that you can view somewhere, so calculating the profit should not be a problem.
@_date: 2016-12-15 10:15:53


There is no exchange. Every transaction on the lightning network IS a bitcoin transaction. I think you should read the [paper](
@_date: 2016-12-09 18:10:44
Unless they get instantly moved like they were with previous entropy bugs.
@_date: 2016-11-25 10:03:19


Yes. Well, kind of. It needs to be synced up to the blocks your transactions are included in.


Yes, SPV wallets use almost no resources at all. Check out [electrum]( You can export the private keys from bitcoin core and sweep them in electrum; and yes, you can do that right away if you want - [this is how you do it](

Please, explain how he is vandalizing bitcoin? I think we'd all like to hear that story.
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:24:13
In order to deny other transactions an attacker would need to flood the network with about 5000 transactions (one full block) per 10 minutes with a transaction fee that is higher than most of other transactions, let's say 50 satoshis/byte. That makes it 5000 * 11250 satoshis/10 minutes = 81 bitcoins/day = 60000 usd/day. Having said that even a small(er) percentage of such transaction would probably be disruptive enough.
@_date: 2016-12-06 09:08:21
Yep, it needs lightning, and we can get that quicker if we get segwit - so show your support for that.
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:11:55


I don't see how it's any different than any other offline wallet out there.


That's what backups are for.
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:48:38
Disk size is not as much of a problem since pruning has been implemented. You can basically decide exactly how much disk space you would like to use.
For me personally the raw amount of data being transfered is more of a problem, as my upload speed is capped to the theoretical maximum of a whooping 0.8 Mbps.

Your fee is still too low because your transactions are huge. You need 71 satoshis/byte, yours is only ~~0.5~~ 5 satoshis/byte for the first tx and 11 satoshis/byte for the second. They might confirm after this wave is over.

Nobody is denying that asics give us a ridiculously high number to invest if someone were trying to gain 50% of the hashing power. The problem is all this power is all of a sudden being in only a few spots - that could easily be tempered with and/or destroyed. In the beginning when everyone could (and did) throw their cpus and gpus at bitcoin that a problem - so illuminatiman is proposing using **both** algorithms to secure bitcoin, if such a thing is possible.
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:21:24
So am I. I certainly don't want it to come to orphaning blocks, but I think not having segwit sets us back a lot.
@_date: 2016-11-21 07:26:54
What does this have to do with the difficulty? Difficulty is there to ensure fairly constant number of bitcoins are mined per time period. Bigger rig = more hashing power = more mined bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:48:06
Yes, it's simple to hard fork bitcoin and force everyone to upgrade, isn't it.
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:54:06
Ah, a typo.
@_date: 2016-11-23 08:40:33
Unfortunately yes, this is the case. Joining a ton of small inputs is always going to be expensive. This is why we need off-chain transactions.

It doesn't, but it does make you obnoxious as fuck when you keep stating that and nobody is denying it.
@_date: 2016-11-15 06:20:29
I understand that and to a point I agree, but the protocol is designed in such a way that it really doesn't matter if it's 50% or a 100%. It's not even a lot of work for miners to achieve this, too. Taking that into account 95% just seems a ridiculously high number and might just hinder progress.

No, pruning only deletes parts of the merkle tree that is dead weight - those parts that can't be referenced in any new transaction. All this was described in satoshis paper if you want to know more about the details.
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:44:17
Threads like this really show you how most of the people are using bitcoin just to speculate and possibly make a quick buck.
My advice is to use them as much as possible. Buy stuff with them. Educate yourself about them and if you like the mentality behind it then you can always buy more if you feel like it's a good match.
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:02:12
This is unrelated to this so I'm sorry for asking it here but you seem to be knowledgeable about the topic. If I understand correctly a lightning channel depends on time-locked transactions with decreasing lock time - how does it handle something like the current situation, where an inaccurately calculated fee would delay confirmation of such a transaction over a period that is chosen until the next 'hop'?
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:20:53
When the channel is closed - and it is, at some point, the transaction is broadcasted to the network.
In any case you are nitpicking on the definition that's on the wiki. A transaction is just a bunch of data conforming to some form, broadcasted or not.
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:39:25
That is exactly what I was saying. Use the coins you were given, read up on it and if you feel like you want to speculate buy more after you know what you're doing.
@_date: 2016-12-09 10:21:05

There's only 4 ways to get a transaction confirmed:
- use RBF
- use CPFP
- convince a miner to include your transaction
- wait it out
All of those have been explained countless times on here.

@_date: 2016-11-15 06:59:11
I understand that. I'm wondering why it was chosen as such a high number in the first place because it really doesn't make any sense, I'm not advocating we lower it after the fact - if lower number were chosen it wouldn't be ok because high consensus is needed but if 70% of the miners decide to ignore other blocks that is ok and is part of the game?

How is that true? Bitcoin can handle up to 7 transactions per second, 300x less than VISA. If that isn't the definition of small then I don't know what is. Futhermore we don't even have any idea how many bitcoins have been lost - I would hazard a guess that most of those from the first year(s) are lost.

That's your responsibility.
@_date: 2016-11-19 22:31:16
I think a statement that they're willing to do this would be enough, because miners are all greedy. I don't think there's any reason to try hiding this, if the protocol allows it it's fair game.
@_date: 2016-11-11 16:01:03
I've been thinking if this is possible for a while now. Keeping sha is good because the amount of money needed to gain 50% is probably much, much higher than with a memory-intense algorithm.
@_date: 2016-11-06 21:11:40
Segwit is mainly not about blocksize increase. I think increasing the effective block size was a big mistake because now people think segwit is all about that.

@_date: 2016-11-25 14:33:47
I agree, but don't know with what point of my post you disagree. If you create transactions with a high fee then you block transactions that were created before that from confirming before your transactions confirm, which is exactly what I stated. If you want this to be a prolonged attack you need to sustain this kind of transaction flow.


No, it wouldn't, because the fee those transactions pay is so low every client with dynamic fees would pay more anyway. I don't even remember last time when 20 satoshis/byte was enough.
You also edited out the part about those transactions not requiring high fees that I was essentially replying to.
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:21:31
Can you tell us the location, so we can check?
@_date: 2016-10-29 08:09:13
Very true. But surely there has to be one person that you trust to know where the backup is? I have a seed protected by a password, seed is in a bank safe only i have access to, and my family knows the password. If anything happens to me I'm sure they could get to both.
@_date: 2016-10-21 12:31:51


i don't quite understand what you mean. Since the passphrase space bigger than the address space there are potentially many passphrases that map to the same address, if that's what you meant.
@_date: 2016-10-04 22:45:20
It still works with the mytrezor website, but I would much rather use electrum. It worked fine with the last version of electrum apart from being able to use an empty passphrase. Hoping this would be fixed with the new version I updated and now it's not working at all.
@_date: 2016-10-26 08:37:41
It's not so easy. You can't just delete a transaction because if it's a legit transaction then it's likely in many other mempools as well, and it's just gonna refresh until it's either confirmed or replaced by another transaction or deemed not important enough and slowly dropped from everybody's mempool.
What could possibly be added is a way to hide transactions that won't confirm so there's less clutter.
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:09:01
Electrum gives you a slider for the fee where it clearly states the expected time to confirmation. I suggest you change your wallet if what you're using isn't doing the correct and very much needed fee estimation.
@_date: 2016-10-28 13:23:11
To be fair, probably it's just because he has a properly generated password(s) with enough entropy already memorized.
@_date: 2016-10-21 09:37:44
It's 24 words and each word has 11 bits of entropy, so all in all it's 264 bit of entropy while a bitcoin address only has 160 bits, so it would take about 2^104 times more time than cracking a single address.
Alternatively even knowing the words and not knowing the order is still 80 bits of entropy, which by current standards is still secure enough.
@_date: 2016-10-04 19:03:14

I don't know what you're talking about. Mycelium is painless to install, one click and you have a perfectly working wallet, all that is asked of you is to make a backup.

I would think offline wallets are the actually free alternative to hw wallets, as they basically provide the same thing if done properly. Electrum and armory both provide this functionality. Multisig wallets are still not offline so they have the same vulnerability other wallets, albeit less so.
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:13:20

If a computer is connected to the internet after a wallet has been used on it you have absolutely no idea of the attack vectors possible. Might be malware in the os, maybe your bios is infected. You truly cannot say. If you want to be safe you need a computer that never touches the internet once a wallet has been used on it. This is how the majority of offline wallets work. If you have an old computer that you have no other use for this is also perfectly achievable.
@_date: 2016-07-08 07:07:23
If you have money to waste then it's not a problem, obviously, but otherwise it's just a really bad financial decision.

There's an additional option to encrypt it with a password in the advanced options of the trezor setup page. That password is not stored anywhere, so make sure you don't forget it.
@_date: 2016-07-25 15:44:21
That may be so, but if it were an optional update to the firmware then it would give peace of mind to those that are able to make sense of it.

This. Buying an expensive car is just so dumb. Any cheap car will get you from point A to point B. If you need to drive fast just go on a gokart track and you'll get all the adrenaline you need *and* be a lot safer about it.

Get yourself a ledger hw.1, it's about 20$ and worth every penny.

I agree, but for that you don't really need a super expensive car. You'd probably get a whole lot more enjoyment out of the cheapest caterham than from an M5.
edit: I'll admit I have stated it poorly. I didn't mean to say that if you have money you can comfortably spend on a car that it's bad. I just see so many people that don't and buy expensive cars to bite them in the ass later on that I get a bit biased.

With a device that has a display, would it be possible to show the bip44 path of the change address on the display prior to signing the transaction?

I did. We've heard the same story countless times. No need to make yet another reddit submission about it.

I was trying to find out what technically the splits she is talking about are. I have yet to find *any* explanation.
