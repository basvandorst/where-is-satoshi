Good call!  That's awesome your doing that, but yea how much is this venture they are putting out and where do you state your ideas on your company?
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:30:18
What systems were they using?  And it makes me wonder how the guy making 8million a month in the US makes news for how much he's making but yet they are bankrupt.....what did the company do?

Antminers are currently available (bang for the buck).  Cointerra just shipped their first batch, but they were not able to reach their TH amount as stated and their power consumption was a little over what they were going for.
If you were going to spend that much money, I would suggest in investing it directly into bitcoin.  You will breakeven having your mining equipment....eventually.  But how long it would take you depends on 
*when your machine comes in
*what the network difficulty is at the time you receive it
*how many other TH machines that have been on preorder for months have already reached the hands of customers (thus increasing the difficulty)
*How much BTC is worth
Granted, the thought of mining works great if you wind up with "X" Bitcoins, over "X" time, increasing your hardware to keep up with the difficulty, and having faith that BTC will go up in value.
Or at $9100 divided by $700 if you were to buy into bitcoins tonight.  Leaving you with 13 Bitcoins, and if/when Bitcoins price rise after the Terrahash machines hit the network (like it did when the Gigahash machines hit).  And they go up to $1000 or even up to $1200 like they were.
Then your looking at a profit of 3900-6500.  Just to give you a perspective.  That's just my two cents...hope that helps!

That's the reasoning behind it.  And North Texas Bitcoin is actually where I'm at.
But that's why I was offering it for $1 a decal!  With .50cents for shipping to handle the envelope and transfer tape.  But any bitcoin decals to show your love are great in my mind.

Canada is definitely doable.  I just felt bad when I was asked a few times about Europe!  No matter what I do, they don't change the price.  
So working out a bulk shipment to one contact and having them ship it out individually.  Let me know location and I'll check on shipping for you!  Thanks!

Go to bitcoinwisdom.com then go to the top right hand corner click the mining link, then bitcoin difficulty I believe and you can see current mining equipments cost/hashing rates/wattage and what your ROI is on speculation with the percentage change of difficulty along the way.  And you can put in your speculation price on what Bitcoin will be, which drastically changes the ROI.
Gives a good idea as to why they call it a gold rush.  Otherwise what I  suggest doing what I did for my boy and get some antminers or something like that which takes next to know power and you can use as many as you want on a USB hub. But I  would check out some units that are being sold within a budget you expect to not make back, but that will in fact help the network and mine you small amounts (if on a pool) for verifying transactions and what not.  
But to invest in bitcoin by investing in mining is something where you will constantly need to keep adding the new miners coming out to your setup, selling your old ones before they cost more in electric, cooling and your significant other arguing about why the office is so hot( from experience and my small amount) then the amount you can mine on a daily due to difficulty.

Ok there area alot of people who talk nonsense on here, but yes my girl and I bought our first home a few months back which needed work.  So her, our 5yr old, and myself have been sleeping in the living room while I've been working and trying to get these rooms done.
That plus she was in a car wreck last month in my car, a guy ran a stop light and totaled my car (luckily she just dropped off the kid).  The guy ran, and thank God witnesses took her out of the car and gave their statements but cops never found him and having only liability, we got screwed :-/
So alas, I have yet to get it touched up.  My girl and friend were going to do that for me for my bday and a tat I want.  But I need to sleep in a BED before I do that!  Thanks for remembering me thou! lol

I know majority is from Mt. Gox, I did my research I'm guessing over $400 but definitely under $500 before it bounces back again to the $1200 it's suppose to be at.  But I can't find the charts for what it's suppose to be at due to mining at the current point.
Does anyone have any of these charts or their own speculations
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:32:15
Let the people who aren't doing their research panic...there are too many wealthy people, either from BTC ad or bBTC (before bitcoin) lol.  They will just buy in for their benefit and bitcoins economy benefit

Actually we read up about the size of the blocks and what sizing to do in order to account for the bleeding.  There is actually a site that states how to tattoo qr codes.  Luckily enough when you have good connections, touch ups aren't a problem.
Besides I think it's just going to add to the remaining portion of my sleeve tat, that is on the way!  But for now...it's fun and a convo piece to help increase BTC awareness.

I said according to Usebitcoins.info.  I see one other tattoo shop now on there that opened at the same time, but that must of come up after I searched it up.  That's awesome about the one in Argentina thou!
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:17:17
I decided to do it!  Got what appears to be, according to my search, and correct me if I'm wrong....the first Bitcoin QR Code/Payment Address tattoo!  It's on my left forearm, here's a upclose pic on paper bitcoin money, for some reason I can't scan it when it's on the comp and resized, so I included the actual digital QR Code that we took it from!
I know there will be haters, but honestly I've already gotten compliments from people who don't know what it is!  Soon I will have LIBERTAS * AEQUITAS * VERITAS placed around it.  
Any donations to add to it are greatly accepted and appreciated!  The shop that did it was one of my clients,  [Fastlanetattoos.com]( who I talked into accepting bitcoin a couple weeks ago!

That's legit indeed if that's what you mean!

Hey everyone! 
I have been in love with bitcoins since I first started hearing about them! I am by no means a beginner and have full faith in BTC which is why my family based business has decided to startup   The current ones we have done are coffee mugs, beer mugs, pint glasses, and shot glasses that have the standard bitcoin logo.
We accept payment in bitcoins for all our custom etched glass! If you don't see something you would like to see on these glasses, let us know and we will work something out! Or if you see something you want and would rather pay by credit card or paypal you can let us know and we will direct you to our other site.

This is a great post about what is going on currently.  Hope every bitcoin believer and true enthusiast is ready to pick it back up!  Let's wait til the price of mining equipment bounces back down and best believe I'll be buying my friends some Block Eruptors so they can get in on the action!
Where do you guys think it will drop until the increased rise?
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:19:49
Actually it took 2 hours for him to do a 2in square sadly...it was sectioned off by each block and the transfer paper that was put on there wasn't cooperating as it was rubbing off.  He used a size 5 single needle to get each of the blocks done.  That's why I have multiple pics to prove that it's not photoshopped or transferred in there.

It's only scannable based upon skin tight, the location was for me, but not necessarily with the full intention of being easily scannable.  At least it's not a tramp stamp as the tat shop wanted me to do! lol jk
