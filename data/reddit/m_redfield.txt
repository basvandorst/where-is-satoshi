Because a 2% return per *year* is huge for Wall Street.

...BTC/CAD is on par with BTC/USD on Kraken right now. Huge chance for our Yank friends to make a quick 30% gain.
annnnd we're back up.

Okay, but, why? What TF is going on that is causing this crash?
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:10:47
It's also the gravitational center of the world if you go by the density of egos.

Kinda funny watching the sell walls disappear for a second and bitcoin shooting up only to suddenly be held down again. It's like trying to hold a balloon under water.

At tier 4, which raises your max withdrawal limit, you are limited to $100k a day, $500k a month. $180k in one transfer would technically be over the daily limit, so I'm hoping you talked to them before you tried to pull it out.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:20:05
You're not wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:08:52
Just make sure you leave a spot or two, otherwise they drive right by.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:06:24
$13.5k now.
...$12.8k 14 minutes later.

Canadian here, I have a verified account but it doesn't let you trade in anything other than BTC/LTC.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:01:49
After I realized I couldn't trade in any real capacity with Coinbase I didn't bother putting Bitcoin in. Sorry!
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:41:27
You made some bucks and cashed out, no problems there!
Buy yourself something nice for Christmas, then maybe put a few bucks back into bitcoin and see where it goes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:32:17
That was the OG method, then they got wise. The trick after that was to convert 1gold into 1btc by dropping your gold and then clicking on your btc right as you pick up the gold.

I remember last time Bitcoin did this, there were pie charts and line graphs *everywhere*. People were watching the whale wallets like a hawk, waiting for any sort of movement that might indicate it's time to cash out. The one wallet with ~400,000 bitcoins in it was a key piece, don't know what happened to it.
Anyway, when it broke $1kUSD, it was **exactly** like it it now. It kept rising, hit ~$1200, and then the sky started falling. Thing is, everybody noticed after the fact that it flows like a wave, it has regular peaks and valleys that, at their low point, don't hit lower than it was before, but always got a little bit higher.
If you're buying bitcoin as an investment and planning to sell it like a stock, you'll probably make ~20% before it peaks right now. If you're buying to hold on to it and use it as a currency in the future, then you won't really lose anything. The people who are at major risk are the ones buying in about a month's time.

There are a bunch of ATMs around me here, and they all have a 5% markup on purchases as and 7% on sales. It's about $70 to wire transfer from my bank account into an exchange, so it's still worthwhile to go through the ATM for smaller fiat amounts, after the transaction attacks die down.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:40:34
They pulled the chair out and are just waiting for people to let go now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:42:57
Don't spend it all in one place.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:41:04
Minus your transfer fees to get it back on the exchange so you can sell it and turn it back into fiat, which also has a fee of course.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:07:32
Buy and sell walls are a blessing and a curse.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:15:53
Daytrader here - you're either on a scam exchange or you're doing something wrong. Even a 1% swing should net you a nice profit on a full bitcoin, after exchange fees (which most take 0.16/0.14%)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:32
Everyone is talking about stop losses and selling in a panic, and I'm sitting here just patiently waiting. It's like making cake, just hold still and it'll rise.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:09:16
Good luck bro! Don't spend it all in one place.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:57:30
Maybe the US is different, but in Canada you only pay tax when that money leaves the exchange and enters your bank account. That money isn't technically yours yet if it's still on the exchange.

I trade in CAD, mostly because the percentage swings are bigger and numbers are higher. I was regularly selling at 12345.6 all day yesterday.
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:04:06
$5100 on Finex, $5100 on Mex, $5142 on Kraken.

Well, you called it.

The only way to fuck him over would be to tank the price to levels not seen in years...
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:43:39
We've had so many of those the past few weeks they mean nothing. Shit, a week ago we had two 1.4k BTC buys in two minutes and it still tanked.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:28:35
Like my buddy's girlfriend?
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:04:23
That is assuming the value of the bitcoin stays around where it's at now, right?
If he were to cash out at a higher rate (which it's projected over time, of course), he should make out with even more.
...I almost want to try this.
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:16:34
Unless the robocoin starts power walking like a true Mcmahon, I wouldn't worry.
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:22:45
Blows my mind that there was a wallet out there with $264M USD worth of Bitcoin in it, and it was worth double that a month ago. Whoever this is has either no need for the money, or the best poker face in history.
The idea of moving 120k coins into many smaller wallets is interesting, seems like it could be a smart move for slowly cashing out, or perhaps to avoid raising suspicion with certain authorities. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:01:22
A low of $460, a weighted average of almost $600. This is still hilariously high compared to March.
