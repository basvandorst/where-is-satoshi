It's not Bitcoin that can change the world, it is cryptocurrency. It makes no difference if it is Bitcoin or any of the perhaps hundreds or thousands that will follow and perhaps also be popular and even possibly more advanced and easier to use. 
In the big picture what is important is the role of currency. Electronic currency is still in its very early stages and there will be many more hurdles ahead.

Of course it will be illegal. All other financial institutions will be barred from trading currency into coins and vice-versa. People don't understand that the trading of bitcoins can be uncontrolled, but anytime coins are traded into currency through a bank can be controlled and non-anonymous. Which should be expected as the government still needs to collect tax revenue etc.

If the reports are true then it is pointless. After the lawyers are done there will be nothing left of the bank accounts. In order for the bankruptcy proceedings to move forward the site must be profitable, otherwise just liquidate.
If the site doesn't have a huge number of users that are willing to exchange with them then it is nothing but a pit of debt and the cost of maintaining the staff and servers etc would be more than just opening a new exchange.

That sounds like going back to the barter system. It is a big problem for Chinese users.

There is nothing simple about that. It has been deemed illegal by the government to allow any transfers of Yuan into BC's. Nowhere that I know of does the government say this is temporary.

Temporarily?!? When exactly did they say Yuan would again be allowed to be used to purchase BC's? As I understand it currency in China can no longer ever be used to purchase BC's.
