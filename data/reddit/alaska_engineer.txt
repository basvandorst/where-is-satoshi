Yes.  It seems to be a natural function of human society.

Enough BTC have been sold to cover the fiat value of the claims (~$500/coin) at 100%.  The remainder of the coins, if fully distributed should be about 17% of the claimed BTC.  If you had 1 BTC on Gox you should get around 500-600 bucks and around .17 BTC.

It doesn’t.  Again, a $50000 loss to one person can be a life changing loss, where to another it’s a minor setback that prompts a small tweak to their trading strategy.  Once again, it depends on the *percentage* of their portfolio that was at risk in the trade.  Thinking in percentages is key to investment and risk management.
If I lose 90% on a position that is 2% of my portfolio, it is much different than someone who has mortgaged their home on the same trade.

Interesting question as this is the situation the MtGox trustee is in right now.  How to disperse 200000 bitcoins.  Sell as a lump sum to institutional investors?  Sell slowly on exchanges?

They do blame cash in many areas.  Look up civil asset forfeiture.

Ouch - sorry!  I know the pain.  Did you get your claim in?

Still easier than getting them back from MtGox....

True.  Good point.

You don’t need to save anything electronic.  If you have the keys, you have the coins.  Written or memorized or electronic.  
It is hard to memorize a key, so many wallets make this easier through a list of words that will generate the keys.
