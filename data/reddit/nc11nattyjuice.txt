Don't leave coins on an exchange.
Don't do KYC. It's only good for criminals identity theft, the IRS and intelligence services but never for you.
If a platform starts doing KYC, leave the platform (localbitcoins, shapeshift,...).
Use DEX (Decentralized exchange, no KYC here!). There is no single point of failure.
Wthdraw funds to personally controlled wallet.

paypal is horrible. i have experienced similar things like you but worse, ending also with accusing me of being the criminal, they wanted all sorts of proof and stuff. was lucky enough to put an end to this with help of my lawyer but i can vividly imagine how many people who do not consult their lawyer do not get their funds back. it is horrible how they sometimes freeze your funds like its their money. bitcon does not have these problems. no 3rd parties, no censoring, no freezing, awesome. you are totally right, thats one of the many reasons bitcoin will win.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:34:52
amen to that
rationality is what a lot of people lack.
if you come up with "how to buy without KYC" look into decentralized exchanges like bisq
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:32:10
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:27:04
if you use bisq you can buy without real limit and withot KYC

normally, in western countries it is "  **innocent until proven guilty**.  "
on the end of the table the best thing to say is "am i arrested?". if yes, "i want to call my lawyer"
if no "goodbye" and go.
don't answer any questions. if necesary, state this. "i don't answer questions".
no point in talking any more than that with extortionists, they are not your friends.
if they know thay have nothing against you they will try to make you say something stupid. if you don't say anything. nothing can be held against you.
things like IRS operate based on fear. the thing **they fear** are citizens who are knowledgeable and vigilantly exercise their rights.
it's totally worth and pays off to exercise your rights.

yes bisq is awesome.
no KYC, no AML so no foreign-interest-spying on users.
bank wont know either what you are doing. thats aweseome as it is not their business anyway what you do with **your** money. you just send money to someone else. same as ebay or craigslist.
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:04:39
Vote with your wallet. Screw them. Buy / sell via bisq, over the counter (OTC), peer to peer, whatever.
Measurements like this are to spy on the people, not to actually fight 'criminals'. The real criminals run whole banks to 'launder' their money. Everyone who really is up to it can have a fake-ID or pay a strawman. Nothing more fearsome for 'them' than people transferring their wealth out of their control (=out of USD / FIAT). They want to track these movements.
You want KYC for your service? Keep it then.We will find someone who wants to make proper business instead of spying for foreign masters.
Once a critical amount of people is in crypto, things like KYC, frozen accounts, transactionlimits and state-sanctioned theft will remain things of the past.
The line gets drawn where a 3rd party wants to put its nose into my business. That's unacceptable. Thus, KYC is unacceptable.
@_date: 2019-11-15 00:52:43
The answer is: **bitcoin is good for those who do not want their funds to be blocked**

as long as you hold you are fine. but the centralized exchange still has your KYC data.
you might want to withdraw all your funds to a wallet you control and request an account deletion plus a deletion of all your data. its unlikely they will really delete it but at least you have tried.
then randomize your bitcoin (mixer, coinjoin, wasabi wallet,....).
after this, its no longer possible to determine any connection to you.

because financial things are supposed to be private. it is noone elses business but the owners.

its ok if companies are centralized, thats how things work in non-communist countries
if people vote with their wallet, free market will fix things (aka shitty companies wont make profit anyway and disappear and someone else doing it better will eventually take thir place)

Hotels and jewellery do not need data. They accept the payment and are happy. Same goes for some real estate. Neither they nor me intend to share any information with a 3rd party. IRS can see account x sent amount y to account z. They dont even know who is the accountholder and in which country this took place. This leaves public flights which are not something really relevant for taxation. Private flights are even another thing.
But keep in mind, everything can be done perfectly legal. If you are (no longer) an US citizen, 10 years later you are no longer are required to file incometax. If you found a company wich resides in another country you can also bypass a lot of taxation. If you for for example go to some euopean country and cash out there and then take your money you made there back to the US it is also very economic.
Oh and i forgot the most important part. There are already some really good lawyers who accept bitcoin aswell.
Those are the ones wo definitely make sure noone fcks up your privacy and wealth. Everything prefectly legal.

As long as someone has his keys no chargeback is possible. Ever.
Thats one of the many reasons why it is important to control your own keys.
Having currency on an exchange means you do not control the keys. Thus it is better to transfer the funds to an adress where **you** own the private key.

Schools, libraries, police, parks, public transport etc do not need the ridiculous amounts of taxes which are taken. A fractal would be enough for that. This is where the problem resides. All the other money is used for illicit purposes, mostly foreign interests or even harmful things.
The government is the cartel which was the strongest. If you dont give them your money, they will imprison you. If you resist, they will use force. But of they will tell the happy "schools, libraries and parks" story to make sheeple accept it.
Being the biggest cartel enables them to act more friendly and not as harsh as smaller cartels.

even beeing religious and having my own "moral standards" i still dont care for what other consensual adults do. especially if it affects me and my life zero. in the end you have to justify to yourself and to God, not to people. if someone is a pornographic actress its OK for me (and even if it was not ok to me it would not matter as i dont matter for them aswell).
if someone is a whore its OK. if someone works as nurse its OK. i am not looking down at someone for chosing a different lifestlye, even if i would not want this lifestyle for myself. - it is OK as long as none is forced into this lifestyle and as long as noone tries to force his lifestyle upon others. pornstars dont force anything on anyone.

thats what most of us did, lol.
a fatal error.

you can try your luck with leverage trading but its also likely you will lose your money. if you need money urgent you should go and work and stop spending money on everything which is not crucial for living.
buy some bitcoin and maybe some other crypto and see what happens with the price. maybe you make gains after some time.
if someone tells you "hey you can get rich quick" it is usually a scam.

get out of bitcoin seems like bad advice.
rather get out of fiat and get into (some) altcoins. however there are not many who seems worth to buy and have a future.

fck BitPay, its not better than banks. bitpay is scam.
noone should use this criminal service. if you want to recieve donations create a wallet and post its adress, done. no 3rd party needed!

oh climate-change hysteria... go suck on a paper-straw...
its the same hysteria as with the ozone hole some time ago, its all about making money off dumb sheeple
aside bitcoin, selling CO²-certificates to european idiots is probably one of the most profitable things to do

it is like everywhere on the internet. there are helpful people, there are lurkers and there are condescending idiots. put the last ones onto your ignorelist and everything is fine. dont waste time with them. use this time to learn about bitcoin instead. its worth it.

the problem of corrupt governments spying on citizens is what bitcoin is intended to solve. thus bitpay which supports this rouge behavior is to avoid.

btc is not about making you rich, yet it still does, as a byproduct of helping you achieving real control over your funds.

"only 3k+"
its noones business what i buy for whatever amount except the counterparty which is selling to me. bitpay has proven as a service not trustable as they spy on you. my identity is none of their business.

once one understands this graph, there is no more emotion except the joy of understanding it and the urge to buy when it dips.

if you do make sure to move the coins, otherwise you can lose your grip on them pretty fast

its not fake bars, its fake stamps. no serious buyer cares for the stamp or the origin of the gold. a serious buyer only cares for it beeing gold and not mantled wolfram.

what movie is this?
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:00:57
playing video games in 2009 and letting bitcoin run in the background made some people rich.

its especially camgirls as with bitcoin your funds wont get frozen like with paypal plus there is no 3rd party which robs a part of your money. as a pornographic actor you can take cash without problem as you are personal here anyway.

i could have also answered you "gold, bitcoin (will still grow in value a lot), ethereum and monero" you like this answer more?  :P
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:31:50
you (and all of us otherws who do not use proxy) already are on a list for being interested in crypto which will sooner or later outsmart fiat (and make its real owners powerless)
