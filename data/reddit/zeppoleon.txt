Oh come on, why not lump opiates or stimulates in there?
It's exactly the same. Just because someone is addicted to a substance whether it be weed or opiates doesn't mean they should be abused or discriminated against.
Everyone has problems and it's all relative. Everyone deserves help.

This is amazing, just found a lot of money owed to me and my family!!

You say this as if no other currency is tainted by drugs. The U.S. Dollar is literally tainted in drugs.  
Again, you could argue what makes a currency "legitimate" is because it is preferred by the black market. 
I think you're viewing the association with SR as overly negative. Sure drugs are bad, but a lot of other stuff we take for granted have dark pasts as well. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 10:06:35
....because Silk Road is, and is always going to be, a huge part of Bitcoin's past. 
There would be no Bitcoin without SR.
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:43:05
The bitcoin address was a contingency plan after SRS/Reddit called Paypal to freeze their donations. 
Give them a break. It's like a team of 5 guys working on something that the 175 people at reddit could barely handle.

Well don't forget about all the other crypto currencies that were around (and still are). 
You could argue the reason why Bitcoin is as successful as it is *because* SR chose Bitcoin as their primary choice of cryp currency.

I use [VirWox.com]( I don't know if it's the cheapest, but it sure is the easiest and fastest.
Once you get it down you can get BTC in under 5 minutes if you really need them! 
The process is this:
1. Deposit USD.
2. Exchange USD to SLL (second life linden dollars).
3. Exchange SLL to BTC.
4. Withdraw BTC to wallet. 
5. ???
6. Profit!
Yes, it is pretty unorthodox that you have to go buy SLL first, and then BTC. But if you play the market game it can actually come in handy sometimes. 
I was first drawn to this service because you can use paypal to deposit money! Isn't that wonderful? No more connecting your bank account, transfering information, yadadada. A simple paypal purchase and you're in the game, baby!
The only thing you have to do is download second life for a one time validation in-game, and then you can uninstall it and never have to deal with that piece of shit game ever again! 
Also at first you can only deposit a certain amount of money, but the longer you use the service the more money you can deposit at a given time.

I don't use Mt.Gox...I use BTC for illegal reasons and they don't like that.
@_date: 2012-01-06 00:08:13
You know what's stupid, the damn Silk Road subreddit. This just totally undermines the not so perfect security features of Tor/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-02-17 09:31:31
Good job man! 
@_date: 2012-07-05 01:36:36
I wouldn't use mt.gox in the first place.

Makin' paper is a lifestyle.
@_date: 2012-09-07 19:01:06
Exactly like all the other legitimate currencies of the world.
Frankly, bitcoins would never make it if it could not be used to drugs, porn, and poker. 
@_date: 2012-01-31 03:29:21
They are wrong. SR doesn't sell firearms anymore. DBush stepped down and decided not to sell anymore guns due to speculation that it would bring unwanted attention and ultimately bring down SR.

I like "dry" jerky. Jerky that you gotta tug on, ya know what I mean?? Not like that Jack Links stuff...too mushy for me.
I also like it a little spicy.

Who here watches TV? Cable TV? There is your answer. Those that have the brain capacity to understand bitcoin do not spend their waking hours watching TV.
@_date: 2012-01-28 08:08:32
Not sure if intentional miss-spelling... 
@_date: 2012-01-28 03:15:45
Haha this is the shittiest article I've ever read. The "journalist" even feels the need to point out that bitcoins are hacker currency. What the fuck?
And it's not like if someone really wanted to buy a gun they would jump through all the hoops just to buy it off SR. They could just go to any ghetto and purchase a black-mart ghetto blaster.

Asshole of the day everybody!
@_date: 2011-11-26 22:11:08
This is the method I use...the conversion rate can be a real hassle though. Right now if you deposit $40 then buy L$ (~9,500) then convert that to BTC it comes out to 12BTC. Basically 3.3 BTC/USD...the actual exchange rate is ~2.4 BTC/USD. You gotta play the market game to get the best value out of your dollars. But if you really want Bitcoins fast this is a good method.
@_date: 2011-12-08 04:55:32
I would think having that many Bitcoins in one wallet would be unwise? 
@_date: 2011-12-11 03:29:26
Lol it's the downvote brigade!

Haha...my god

I've wanted an invite from what.cd for years :(
@_date: 2011-12-18 10:30:30
Did you order these online? If so, where? 
@_date: 2011-12-19 00:34:31

The official bitcoin client.
@_date: 2011-11-29 06:00:03
It's from [Bitcoin.org](
@_date: 2013-07-19 00:52:56
The whole reason bitcoin is even a viable online currency is *because* you can use it to buy drugs.
@_date: 2013-07-19 00:50:47
Hahaha that is such an r/trees thing to say.
"Sure pot is totally cool but man those 'harder' drugs like coke/crack/heroin is wack man!!!"
@_date: 2013-10-03 02:34:47
You do realize that you can buy drugs with USD?
So does that invalidate the USD?
@_date: 2013-07-19 00:48:49
dude you use ":3" way too much
@_date: 2013-07-19 02:07:21
There are good, hard working people that just got totally fucked when they didn't deserve it.
@_date: 2013-01-12 01:10:14
That's pretty neat, so do you make a small profit?
@_date: 2013-07-19 01:09:11
Not saying that most of those people aren't wack but you can't group them all into one category. 
@_date: 2013-01-12 00:43:26
Ah okay, so when you meet with buyers you bring a laptop I presume, and then you buy the bitcoins for them and they give you cash in return?
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:58:52
Sorry I'm just pointing out that just because you can buy drugs with a certain currency doesn't make that currency invalid in anyway. IMO I'd argue that if a certain currency is preferred for the drug trade then it will flourish. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 00:52:03
It doesn't depend on the drug.
You can meet a totally sketch pot dealer and a really nice/friendly H dealer. 
Don't make generalizations.
