Used them and had no issues. As legit as it gets in the USA when it comes to bitcoin.

BS mostly. I work in "wall st" i.e. for a global investment bank that trades and makes billions per year. Private equity is not "wall st" and comments from private equity people have no relevance or use when talking about bitcoin as a currency, unit of value or payment network. On the other hand when I want to hear about some basic excel formulas or building charts, go to PE folk ...
My 2 cents worth are that as a currency or unit of value wall st can ignore bitcoin for another five years at least. It's too small and the technology is pretty crap now. For comparison I designed and helped build a system to calculate real time value of financial products, this uses more than 20k servers to work though 45m transactions per day, each of which does 1000x more math than bitcoin. Nice try, but it's not capable of handling anything of scale now or in the next few years.
As a payment network, it has some possibilities but, again, it's minor league stuff compared to those that exist already. 
Come back in a few years when bitcoin operates at scale with solid technology. Then it might be possible to talk about real effects on the finance sector and how "Wall st" might respond.

Mt gox is resuming withdrawals soon, so now is probably the right time for their clients to be looking around and setting up new trading accounts ...
