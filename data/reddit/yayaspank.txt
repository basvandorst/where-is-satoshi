what if wallets considered the cost of cracking a key and divided up a users total amount of bitcoins into multiple accounts each containing too little bitcoin to be worth the effort
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:58:36
ya.  no need to buy bitcoin directly to poloniex if you just want to hold...just buy it to your own wallet
cause poloniex deals only in crypto trades not fiat...not usd or any other dollars
now if you were wanting to convert your bitcoin to another type of crypto it could be useful....for example ethereum or monero...then you could choose to send some bitcoin to poloniex (after you set up account with them) then trade it for another type of crypto then withdraw that new crypto...
no need to store your bitcoin on poloniex if you holding!  you cannot sell it there for money!  you would have to withdraw it from polo first in order to sell it for money!  polo doesnt deal with money!  usdt is not usd!

no my bank hasnt bothered me...they were the ones who wrote the bankdraft made out to "bit abc company"  practically had bitcoin in the name .... that i bought my bitcoin with
they were more than willing to accept the wads of cash that i gave them a few months later paying off my mortgage...oh ya they took it and loved it
they are weird with me now though...or is it just me?

just hold on to that 3.88 dollars of btc .... maybe it will be worth 500 dollars at some point and then you can get it out

bitcoin is virtual item...it lackes properties that physical items have .... it possesses properties that physical items do not
1.zero mass
2.zero volume
3.can be teleported to anywhere the internet is
4.has a secret password making it only accessable by the person possessing the password
it is these properties that will make it desireable or not...none is being forced to possess or use it and yet they are and it is.  the proof is before us
in my humble opinion
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:15:01
this age thing keeps calling go me...they can make it a real pain in the ass to access fiat with your crypto i am sure....they can scare off 99% of the population by slapping on a few fines and prison time for attempting to transact in something they dont like
they vote
they yell the loudest with the least to lose or gain...nope nope nope thats bad...they dont realize or wont admit that their turn is almost over
i can already see that my children wont view the world in the same way as me...my children dont have my knee jerk reaction that this is right or wrong...they think about everything and are able to combine left and right
you will get your turn when the world rolls out of their cold dead hands and not one moment before
bitcoin and the like needs to be scaled so that everybody can use it for everything doing all the transactions per second that are needed on demand...then you may see money bypassing governments causing them to go broke and removing their ability to enforce

sorry... that much money is more than many of us make in a year gross i think...wish i had useful advice for you...
well...they say that the current rise is mostly those already into crypto (and i think that the price drop of alts supports this)..hoping to cash in on a second free version of bitcoin like what happened with bitcoin cash... so if true it could dip after the fork
im looking at a head and shoulders ... with a receding hair line crossing a bulging waist line but the life line is long so looking good to buy now...i got nothing
i dont know where you will get the best price and exchange rate....im sure that you will shop around...hope it works out for you

Jamie Dimon implied it happened and everyone knows it happened.  It is common knowledge!

google "btc to usd" then multiply that result by however much bitcoin you have ....

would you care for an escrow service? one party slides the cash under the window to the escrow agent...second party sends the bitcoin to the escrow agent .... agent completes the transaction for a fee

i am a layman
ive spent the last couple weeks explaining bitcoin to other layman
its a waste of time
just show them a big fat wad of cash and say it came from bitcoin.  works every time

My thought, after reading your question, is that i am now scared that we are in a huge bubble.  Bitcoin would need to reach $50,000,000 each to begin to give you a lucrative retirement at a $150 dollar buy.
I am HOPEFUL that your $150 will do something nice for you like get you a newer vehicle or take you on a trip.
We shouldnt be pumping people to put money into bitcoin cause its gonna make them rich is my thought.  Thats not what its for.
Disclaimer: i over 6 timed my money in one year...which is called being lucky as f...spend only what you can afford to lose.
Please I dont want to sell and leave a bunch of people holding a bag of crap that they cannot afford.

what happens inside the exchange is off the chain...it gets reconciled to the chain when you withdraw...i dont even know how all those trades would fit on the block if they were onchain
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:18:27
so i think if i copied the entire blockchain and redistributed all the bitcoin on it so each account contained an equal amount and created new accounts for the world leaders containing extra large amounts to get buyin i could call that new chain "Fresh Start"
your account would be on my modified chain too!  with a modified balance

make a paper wallet.  send you coins to the paper wallet. put somewhere safe.
wait to see if there are two separate functioning chains after the fork.  find out how and if it is safe yet to send just your bitcoin1 or your bitcoin2.  means you will need a wallet that handles btc1 and another that handles btc2.  you dont want to send btc1 after the fork and also send it on the other chain if there is one...there may be only one chain after the fork...idk.
coinbase never gave you the bcc?  wankers
you have already been burned once by coinbase(u said they never gave you the bcc).  id get the heck out of there and take control of your coins.
taken literally it says if you had bitcoin on there at the time of the fork that you have bcc
hopefully by jan 1 2018

what if instead of bitcoin we all bought comic books of equal value?  what if those were destroyed or lost?  would you worry then?
you are thinking that bitcoin will replace other currencies...i dont... i think of bitcoin as a thing such as a gold coin.... who really cares if a thing is lost... i imagine many wedding bands are lost or thrown into the ocean every day....the currency that was used to purchace the them still exists...they just keep making more...
when i buy bitcoin what is happening is i am not the one choosing where my currency is spent...the bitcoin seller will spend it i guess...
i drank a cola today when i could have drank water...but instead i chose cola which caused a bunch of extra manpower and effort to be spent just for the flavor...thats manpower and effort lost forever but do i hear anyone worrying about that?

A fork is an identical (except for the changes that the people that did the fork wanted) copy of the original blockchain on which your bitcoin address and balance is written.  So after the fork your bitcoin address and balance are written on both blockchains.  The secret key you have will work on both blockchains (assuming both chains survive).
So if you had a bitcoin address since the beginning and had just left it there you would have that same bitcoin address and key on every single fork that has happened since.
