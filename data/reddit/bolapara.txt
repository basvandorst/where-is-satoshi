No ads: Not going to happen.  Content needs to be monetized or it will not be created.
Non-targeted ads:  Now, the Internet is not any more useful to advertisers than TV or radio ads.
Like it or not, advertisements serve a purpose and the more useful ads are to advertisers, the more attractive the platform.  The more attractive the platform, the more and higher quality content will be created.
I don't like adverts either but since they are a required element, I'd rather see ads that are interesting to me (like Bitcoin products) rather than things like feminine products and such.

I was creating a new (2 of 3) wallet to test.  I chose the web version.  After I created the web wallet I opened up two more browser windows and pasted the ~~identifier~~ shared secret in and gave unique usernames and passwords.  Now, both the other two windows show "Authenticating and looking for peers..." and the first one shows "Waiting for other copayers to join".
Nothing special really, other than maybe using the same browser for all the users?

You should sweep the coins instead of importing the private key.  Importing the private key keeps that address usable by your wallet so new funds could be deposited there.  Sweeping will just move the coins and not keep the private key around for future use.

This really sounds like a question you should be approaching with Bitpay or whomever you choose as a payment processor, not It seems to me that you could process returns in BTC if you held a small amount of bitcoin for this purpose; just enough to cover typical return volumes, plus a small buffer.  Couple that with a restock fee (unless item is defective) and it seems like a pretty good solution to me.

The problem being run into here is not a hash collision, but the ability for someone to resend the same transaction with a different hash.  If you cannot see how this in no way backs up your point then I suggest re-enrolling in your CS 101 course.
Additionally, I suggest you slowly back out of the Bitcoin "room" if you have a problem with cryptographic hashes being used as IDs.  It's a pervasive theme in the system and one which I have no problem with.

It is not comparable.
Your bank accounts are FDIC (or foreign equivilent) insured.  There is no insured Bitcoin wallet at this point.
If someone transfers money out of your bank account to theirs without your permission the banks can reverse the transfers.  This is not possible with Bitcoin.
HSM or not, security is never perfect.

Technically, given an infinite amount of time, you will make more coin if you mine on your own.
The problem is that you do not have an infinite amount of time.  Difficulty is constantly increasing.^1  Your hardware will wear out.  Your electricity will get more expensive.  Total network power will continue to increase.^1  You will die.
What if you have a bad streak and hit the 95 percentile of work to do before solving your block?  You've just wasted a huge amount of time and didn't collect all the money you could have,
Check this [calculator](  What pools do is get you as close to 'average' as possible.  If you mine by yourself, you could hit the 50% or the 95% mark, or [worse/better].  And you could hit that [worse/better] many many times in a row which could be really [bad/good].
1.  These technically effect everyone who is mining, equally, pool or not.

Mining collects transactions into a block and when the block is solved, the 25btc reward plus the mining fees goes to the miner.
When you are mining in a pool, those rewards go to the pool and the pool distributes the rewards to the individual miners who contributed to the block.  It's up to the pool how much fees they want to keep for themselves.

"Expensive"  can refer to both time and money.  In this case I mean both.
Time - You need to figure out the how the victim's node is connected within the network in order to get "his" transaction to him without him seeing "your" transaction and detecting the double spend.
Money - To increase the likely hood of your attack being successful, you could control hash power to try and get "your" transaction in the next confirmed block.

Amazon uses credit/debit cards which TAKE amounts from you.  Bitcoin is a system where YOU SEND the amount.  Obviously what I meant by the Amazon analogy is that you have to wait for the end of the transaction to know what the settlement amount is.
But hey, I guess credit cards are better then, since nothing can go wrong in settlement.  Except, oh shit, didn't Target just have 40M credit card details stolen?  Guess what, that cannot happen in Bitcoin because it is up to you to SEND money instead of them take it from you.  Yes, that means you have to pay a little attention when you do your transaction but to me that is way better than having my credit card stolen and having to deal with that BS.
But, I get it.  It's can't possibly be that YOU didn't pay enough attention to the instructions clearly printed in front of you.  It must be the SYSTEM that is flawed.

That is true, however, the first transaction transmitted will be the one included in the next block.  That is, unless, you control the majority of the hash power and can pick and choose which transactions will be included in the next block.  Even if you control the majority of the hash power it is only slightly more probable that you will mint the next block.  There is majority of hash power AND luck involved to control which of the two transactions is recorded in the blockchain.
Edit: To clarify, yes, the taxi driver should wait for his app to see the valid transaction, but that takes seconds.  If they were spent already, it would not be a valid transaction.  You don't need that to get a confirmation to know that. 
One more edit: I'm glossing over a *lot* of details about how transactions are distributed through the network when I describe how an attack can be performed but the point remains.

The standard bitcoin client wallet encryption is pretty strong.  AES-256.  As long as you have chosen a very strong password (longer and more complex than you initially think is necessary) I would feel safe doing that.  If you're extra paranoid you could add another layer of encryption whether it is GPG or whatever your favorite tool.  Just use another strong and different password.

@_date: 2013-12-27 09:32:08
No, there is no rounding error.
Bitpay told you an exact amount to send and you sent a different and lesser amount.  There may have been a minuscule change in exchange rate from when you THOUGHT you knew the amount to send to the time when Bitpay told you the amount.  If you got to the screen you showed in your screenshot and sent that exact amount Bitpay quoted you would not have a problem.

@_date: 2013-04-25 09:13:47
Each full bitcoin node does verification of transactions as it sees them to determine it's own perception of an accurate ledger since the last block.  A block, or 'confirmation', is basically a checkpoint for all nodes in the network on what the accurate ledger is.  The successful double spend in this scenario would be one in which you fool the taxi driver's bitcoin client to believe that the valid transaction was to him and then you subsequently have a miner confirm a block that contained the valid transaction was instead to your own address.
This depends on you being able to know how the merchant's client is connected with other nodes so that you can get "his" transaction to his node while delivering "your" transaction to your own miners or the majority of the mining pool.  This is not trivial.
If you are a merchant who is worried about double spends (you probably don't need to be) then you should rely on a trusted payment provider to maintain well connected bitcoin nodes so that this attack vector is much more difficult than it already is.  Alternatively, you should run your own bitcoin node, unidentified to anyone as yours, and disallow incoming connections to that node and connect it to nodes you specifically trust.
Bottom line though is that this attack is not trivial and it is unlikely that someone would go through the effort for a small transaction and even if they do make this effort it is not likely to succeed unless a lot of shit goes their way or they just control a massive amount of the mining power.

There are 42357.73 BTC for sale on MtGox right now.  If you wanted to buy 90% of them it would cost you only $17,361,746.75.
In short, the BTC market is still really tiny compared to what the big funds are used to dealing with.  I don't think they are going to dump even $17m in and buy up all the coins on the market any time soon.
I think they'll get in somehow, but not in a big way at this time.

I'm well aware of how Blockchain wallets work.  I  still consider it less safe than a completely offline wallet.  I only keep online the funds needed to do my transactions.  Savings are completely offline in a wallet that has never seen a network.
Now, if he truly needs to have $28K of BTC available online for his transactions then I understand, although I'd likely still not consolidate it all on one service or address for that matter.

Yikes.  OK, you need to stop using the address pair he gave you and delete it from your wallet.  Otherwise you run the risk of your funds accidentally getting into this address and someone else controls the keys.
See [here]( for more info on deleting that key pair.
BTW, MAKE SURE you delete the right one.  Deleting the wrong key could make you lose access to your existing funds.  Also, make a backup of the wallet before doing this in case something goes wrong.

What makes you think that you'll have even the slightest chance of success if you make no attempt to hide the valid transaction from the miners and the fraudulent transaction from the merchant, much less, a 50% chance!?
What makes people believe that double spends are so easy to perform?  They are not.  It is not as simple as merely sending out two transactions on the same coins.
The simplest double spend attack that does not require mining power and has any reasonable chance of success is this:
* Figure out merchant's node ip address
* Make your node "A" make a connection to that address
* Node A sends a transaction to Merchant's node that appears to be to him
* Your node "B" sends a different transaction spending the same coins back to yourself to the rest of the network and their miners.
* Hope that the fraudulent transaction does not propagate the network and get to the Merchant's node
Being that most people now accepting bitcoins are using payment processors who run their own bitcoin nodes, presumably properly secured (highly connected, no incoming connections, outgoing connections to other trusted and highly connected nodes, etc.) the likely hood of this attack succeeding is extremely low.

To be fair, you were stating whether or not someone should be upset about losing an amount on money based on how you feel about losing that amount of money.  Then, when I said that amount may be more to someone than to you, you say that if they think thats a lot of money they should not be spending time on reddit.  You are judging people for their choices or feelings based on your own situation, which is in my opinion pretty self centered.  Maybe you didn't mean it that way, but it really comes across very judgemental.

Transaction fees and mining are also free markets.
If mining is unprofitable then some miners will leave which will reduce difficulty making mining MORE profitable for those still mining.  This also leaves the transaction fees to be distributed among fewer miners, driving profitability higher.
Fees will be governed by a balance of cost and desired confirmation times.  If people who are transacting are not getting confirmed in the time they desire then they will up their fees.
The key, and beauty, to this system is that it is self balancing.  Every part of the system automatically adjusts itself to current conditions.  It's quite amazingly well designed in that respect.

No, that isn't what I'm saying.
The equivalent of a cashier telling you the amount you owe on your bill is the page with the QR code and the amount listed there.  THAT is what you pay.  The amount you pay is the amount provided to you at check out.  The Bitpay screen is the checkout.

Dude, listen.  What people are trying to tell you is that you will not make anything mining with your hardware.  You will literally make ONE CENT a day with that hardware at the current difficult and exchange rate.  It would be much more advantageous for you to walk around the city looking for change on the ground than mine with your cpu.  If you found a quarter that would be much more than you would make in a month mining with your cpu.
