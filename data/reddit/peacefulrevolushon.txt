True.

I have been trying to send a small amount of BTC to someone with a segwit address recently and still seeing stupid fees. Im sending fro a segwit address also. Am I just missing something, or is $3.50 on a $10 transaction expected between segwit addresses?
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:51:03
I wasn't magically expecting fees to go away, but I also remember paying much, much less to send transactions in the past. I wanted to make sure what I'm seeing is normal, and I wasn't overlooking something. 
It's reassuring that I'm not doing anything wrong, just can't move small amounts for reasonable fees currently.

I don't see the same when I get on the site. I'm viewing mobile, so maybe that's it. Or this is a ruse...

We need more people like this. Willing to forgo any personal recognition that would detract from the message he's really trying to convey. He's pretty much saying: Don't focus on me stupid, focus on this incredible new technology I'm trying to introduce the world to!
Great stuff.

I'm quite content with the increase in BTC, but am not under any illusion that it's passive income, or will increase indefinitely. I'm not an expert by any means, but do understand the fundamentals well enough to know that it's real value lies in its potential to radically change global finance, not some delusion that it's going to keep giving me a reliable increase in wealth year after year. Also, I can't do anything to influence it's monthly return. If I have a rental property or an online store front I can do all kinds of things to ensure that keeps creating a stable income for years.

While I agree that your concern is valid, I also think crypto exchange will eventually become like torrent downloads. They'll remain illegal and some people will suffer serious penalties for breaking the rules early on, but it will be impossible to stop and  the ability to trade currency p2p will  eventually become ubiquitous. 
I suspect using decentralized exchanges will be very risky for a while though. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:17:53
Yes, that's true and I didn't consider that. I was more trying to emphasize that just buying or trading is not equivalent to the quote.

His explanation of BTC that I heard back in 2013 is what got me into the space. He explained the technology in such an understandable and concise way that I instantly saw the value and potential. BTC may go to the moon or plummet in value, but what I gained from the knowledge he provided to me will forever be priceless. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:07:12
Awesome, I'll check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:43:58
Thanks I'll give this a try.

This really doesn't belong on r/bitcoin. You can't expect to make money from BTC while you sleep in the long term. It may happen, but I think it's unlikely. When I think passive income, I think online store front, rental properties, dividends, etc. The only way bitcoin could fill that role would be to go up in value for decades to come. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:54:00


That would work, but it was going to be a one time donation. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:06:38
Weird. Cool that it's up there, even of its only the full page!
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:49:08


Yeah, that's what I've been gathering, but as much as I read I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface, so I thought it smart to ask others and make sure I wasn't missing something simple that would cost me more in fees than required. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:36:32
That's a good point, and I really think that stocks may start to be replaced by company run crytos, since they can probably provide some benefits over the current system with brokerages and all. I'm not sure what you invested in and whether or not if functions like that, though. If what you're talking about moves in value based on an underlying asset, like the value of a company that produces goods, or provides a service, then it's value will be tied to the success of that company, just like stocks. On the other hand, if the only thing making the value go up is new buyers to a cryptocoin, I see it presenting the same problem as BTC.

I wouldn't say he missed his chance. I'm sure plenty more interview requests will be coming his way. He's already had spots on JRE and such, so maybe he'll agree to some more interviews that meet his terms. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:53:00
Yep, I'd like to pay less than 5% of the value I'm sending, and setting the fee that low goes far below the recommended rate. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:11:30
OK, I suspected it would be something along those lines. Sounds like a restriction in storage technology, more than space savings that could be achieved through code. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:22:08


To me this is what it has always been about. Watching the price is exciting, but I think the real excitement (the potential for human liberation) is still far over the horizon. I think we'll get there though, the cat's out of the bag.

I'm a little late to this post, but I'm struggling to get this working, and am hoping for some additional guidance. Every guide I've found on this so far has the same instructions, but I can't get it to work. I've downloaded PGP, and tried importing public keys with no luck. The part I get stuck at is where to download an .asc file. I've gone to the page linked above (electrum.org downloage page). The instructions say to "Download the installer of your choice and the associated .asc signature file." Where do I download the .asc file? All I get when I click on the signature link is a page with text, no file to download. Other guides say to save the text to a text editor, like Notepad, and save it as an .asc file, then import into gpg4win. Tried that and the program keeps saying no keys found. I think I'm missing something really simple here, but I've read four or five guides on various pages and it does not seem to be working as described, so I'm never able to actually import the keys, and I know I could try to download the keys from keyservers, but I wouldn't how to search for the Electrum key on a keyserver. 
Any idea as to why I can't get a Notepad file with the pgp key saved in it to import (I've copied the entire plain text, including the pgp sig begins here, and pgp sig ends here text)?
EDIT: (for anyone who stumbles upon this later) So some more searching revealed [this]( video, which is very informative for anyone trying to learn how to verify software signatures, especially because it showed me a simple trick I would have never thought of, but seems so obvious now: right-click the signature link and select save as, which automatically save the file as an .asc text file! An important difference from the video is that the file names that Windows displayed for me in the Explorer were missing part of the name that you'll see in the command prompt (see video at [15:04]( Going by the file names that pop up with the dir command finally worked with the instructions given later in the video. Aside from that, this was the first guide that removed all the guess work and got me past the import keys step.

Could someone explain why we could never have a blockchain that did scale? I know that currently transactions take up enough memory that there's just no way to get more on the blockchain without larger blocks or second layer solutions. 
What I'm curious about is if there could one day be a new protocol that would take up less space for each transaction? I guess what I'm asking is if there is a minimum amount of data required to make a cryptocurrency work and bitcoin is already at that minimum, or could there possibly be a way to record the same information with less memory at some point in time?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:55:57
This shit played more like an ad spot than an interview. "Well guys what would you invest in???" "Oh, totally Bcash!" "Yeah, me too!!!"
What the fuck is this bullshit?! Let's give advice to average, ignorant people without even getting into the real important details, like what are the technical differences, which has a better dev team, etc. 
Seriously, if this wasn't a paid spot for Ver I don't know what you call that, other than free advertising. If they didn't get paid to blindly promote that shit like they just did they are fucking idiots!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:09:50
I may be wrong, as I don't know a ton about investing, but I think it's like that by design personally. There are lots of investments that are restricted to people making less than $250K/yr, or have a net worth less than 1 million (or something like that). Basically *have* to be wealthy to even get in on many investments. I know it's probably to protect people from catastrophic losses, blah blah. I've seen some where I could afford the minimum investment, but am no where near meeting the legal wealth requirements.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:14:35
Shit, I knew they were working on it, but didn't realize they'd made the ruling. 
Pretty much a guilty until proven innocent mentality. All your data are belong to us b/c you *might* be a terrorist...
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:32:07
True. I don't know how all this congestion from new users will affect everything long term, but I can only hope the added pressure to make transactions happen faster and more smoothly will lead everyone involved to create a better network for everyone. I know they're working on it, but maybe this will help expedite it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:12:08
Indeed. There's a video of Andreas Antonopoulos explaining that years from now when a grandparent brings their grandkid down to the bank to for the "traditional" opening of a savings account the kid will think the whole process is stupid af compared to the crypto they've been using since years before they could legally open a bank account. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:03:11
Add to that the facts that BTC probably really shouldn't be considered a traditional investment, and that the article didn't include the total number of non-retirement accounts across all of the major brokerages. 
It lacks a lot of context, and isn't a great comparison, but I thought it was an interesting article nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:59:42
Totally agree. In fact, I've been hoping that companies can release their own crypto to replace stocks (I think companies may already be doing this, but I haven't looked into it much), to eliminate much of the need for brokers. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:06:20
I know this is true long term, but is 1200%+ growth in value over the last year not a huge incentive for miners in the short-term? Serious question.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:48:52


Read post, took this bullet point to heart and disregarded everything else. Have put life savings into BTC! /s
This is all actually really great information. I honestly think with all the new people getting into BTC, something like this should be added to the FAQ or as a sticky, because I think a lot of people are getting into this exclusively as an investment, and are buying blind. There is a "bitcoin as an investment wiki," but it doesn't really stress how important it is to avoid common traps when investing like this post does. 
Also, I think people should stop viewing it as an investment in terms of growth. I personally view it more as a hedge against the buffoonery of government money management, which has wrecked many a currency in the past. The hope is that if my gov screws up our money and the value goes to crap, maybe BTC will still work. If it goes up in value in the mean time, great.
