99% of the world population are and always will be 'noobs'. Do you prefer to remain arrogant and elitist and exclude those noobs? Or would you rather they buy in and hence increase BTC's market cap?  know which one I'd choose.

Fully agree, please, PLEASE do it!
I've heard the same from my friends, and they're not exactly lacking in intelligence. Some of them are old school hackers and most of them are much more computer literate than I am. Yet they say, 'bitcoin will never succeed because it's already too expensive'. No point explaining decimals, fractions etc. Purely psychologically speaking, BTC is already too expensive in the eyes of many people.
Devs, please make up your mind about this one, doesn't realy matter which unit you choose or what it's called as long as it makes bitcoin appear affordable.

Well if they have an old file (2011?) it isn't, which is why I'm asking, any confirmation re that file?

Well, I have some news: Murica is not the centre of the universe, you know. Plenty of people outside the US of A with rather too much experience of having their accounts frozen/seized. Shocker, I know.
