Solution: people that sell other people bitcoins should provide sufficient information about security on their profiles/sites/exchanges. If the community sees people selling to others without providing them this information, they should try to get them to post basic security advice.
We've tried to do this at

Make sure you do a reasonable amount of research into how Bitcoin works before you buy (our site has some information). It prevents you from making mistakes and losing money.

Hi, thanks for buying and for the feedback. This is an item that is on our priority list. I agree, a refreshing page is much nicer than having to refresh it yourself to see if your bitcoins have been sent. Future buys should be even easier as the reference you use will not change.

You are right, Coinfloor was a cheaper option. You just needed to buy above £500 to avoid a deposit charge (I think).
It's not really fair to compare our price to the price at an exchange. We have to risk money on an offshore exchange and pay to get it there and converted into dollars. Coinduit is like the other sellers in the UK. It's essentially just a service to allow people who want to buy small amount to be able to. If you want more than £2000 worth, it's cheaper to send your money to an exchange (but you have to wait a few days).
 
It's better to compare our price against 
and 
If you do end up trying us, let us know how we can improve our services.

Hi Lewis
Our selling platform is online now and needs no sign up (at least for small amounts). We would love feedback on how it feels to use.
 
We are still finalising the KYC functionality to upload personal documents should you wish to buy regularly but this should be done within a week: 
 
In the meantime, it's 100% functional for smaller amounts. We've yet to 'advertise it' here because we would like to finish the KYC part, but after your post I thought I'd let you know that you have another option.

Blockchain.info wallet, informed him about enabling two factor authentication on both Blockchain.info and his email. He enabled the 2FA on Blockchain.info but I don't think his email yet. He says he'll email me if he has any questions. Since I paid him, I have his receiving address, so if he gets a lot of coin on there I'll email him letting him know that he should be protecting his email as well.

Coinduit are a new start-up in Cambridge UK. We've just signed up our first brick and mortar store! 
We actually want to promote Bitcoin so much that we are offering a free loan on an android tablet to the first few (5-10) businesses in our area that agree to start accepting so that they can test accepting bitcoins without any initial investment.
We replace the exact number of pounds that the business quotes its customers essentially providing a 0% fee service for as long as we will be economically able to do so.
If you know of any merchants that want to start accepting bitcoins anywhere in the UK, we are able to offer the same service but require that they provide their own device. This can be a mobile with a data connection, or an android or ipad tablet. We can send setup instructions.
We have created our selling site,  to facilitate the exchange of these bitcoins into pounds so that we may repay the merchants. Right now the limits are low as we are in a testing phase. Feedback is appreciated.
Please contact daniel for more details.

Yeah, you don't need much money to do this. Get them to all download Mycelium and give them all $1 in BTC then offer to make the other teachers coffee and sell them the coffees for $0.25. You can sell them anything (pencils) to get the money back from them.

I didn't make it but I sure can send it on. The guy who did was into sharing. I'll pm you.

This is why we made  (UK only)
Let us know if there is anything we should change on the info pages. Our site is trying trying to make Bitcoin understandable for newcomers.

I liked it. It was my first Bitcoin conference. Got to chat to some of the people that I read about and watch videos of.
I managed to get a free ticket from a promotion so I just had to pay flights and accommodation.

If you are in the UK you can try my site:  to buy a tiny amount. If not, it's got some introductory material to Bitcoin that might help you. Check out the videos by James D'Angelo on the info page.

Looks a bit suspect doesn't it. Luckily, it wasn't me. Not sure why he made a new account for this. If I wanted to be so devious, I would have at least built up a running profile for about a month before commenting.

I think Cambridge (as well as London) is quite a good place to get Bitcoin going because it's quite techie and international. I couldn't imagine trying to push Bitcoin in Cornwall. I feel your pain.
The butcher was only willing to give it a go the second time I visited him and I've visited many others that politely decline. The main reasons being that they had never heard of it, heard bad reports from the media, or wanted to wait until others started accepting before putting in the effort themselves.
Let me know if you feel like trying again at any point (with our help because merchants want £) and I can send you a flyer that will make your life easier.

It's going ok :)

Have a look at CoinOfSale if he want's to keep the bitcoins himself. It provides quotes for £ amounts quoted so that he can track his sales and it gives profit/loss experienced from keeping the bitcoins. Also Electrum is an easy wallet to use.
I hooked a butcher up in Cambridge with a tablet and CoinOfSale. Unfortunately he doesn't keep the bitcoins, but I buy them off him for the price he quotes his customers and sell them on: 
Nothing at all stopping you from providing him this service yourself if he trusts you enough and then reselling the bitcoins that he gets through LocalBitcoins. A sort of DIY BitPay approach.
If you don't want the hassle, I'm looking for other merchants who might want to sell me the bitcoins they receive.  (right now we are working on the site and fixing a few issues, so it reads out of bitcoins for now).

That sounds like a good idea. Can you elaborate? Or is the idea still fuzzy?
The only thing I can think of is a multiple choice question test. Was that the thing you had in mind, or was it completely different?
