That's not true. There can be changes to the protocol that didn't alter past data.  Updates are to be expected.

Can you see any letters at all to the word? I am willing to bet you could brute force it if it is only one word. If you can see letters even easier.

If you know how, write a script that uses every word in the dictionary. If not, and if there is a substantial amount off money pay someone to. One probably already exists though. Just have someone look at the code first before you use it.

21 min mark approximately. He tries to play it off as if it were an afterthought but later you realize he is reading from notes. He wanted the audience to think it wasn't important, yet it was important enough for him to make us believe it wasn't. He's worried.

You can keep two or more wallets (as many as you want) on Trezor. They are hidden behind a passphrase. If you don't enter the passphrase the wallet never recalls the amount it has.  The balance only shows for that particular wallet hidden behind the phrase. For instance I can have .50 BTC in one of the wallets behind passphrase "daily" while I have 20 BTC hidden behind the phrase "bank account". There is no way anyone would know what the wallet had in it

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:36
I don't think you lost it. I just did the same thing using Trezor hardware wallet. They have a recovery tool.  Maybe something similar exists. If it is a substantial amount I would explore your options further before giving up.

It doesn't matter if wealthy individua run the price up by investing. Ultimately, when the price stabilizes (for a more reliable use as a currency) it is still permissionless and trustless. Anyone can transact with it using the blockchain without an intermediary and as long as you hold the private key, it's yours. So for investors, let them run the price up and have custodians hold their keys. For the unbanked, they can still transact and have faith that what they have earned is theirs. Win win.

The difference is that the QR code reorder would not cost the supplier any fees in advertising or commission paid to any shopping cart. 
Same goes with sellers who sell on Amazon or eBay. They slap their own SKU reorder QR code on the item prior to shipping it. When the buyer runs out, just scan and pay using btc. Much quicker and convenient. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 06:26:31
The current price wouldn't be speculation though. It would be the price.

In think the VanEck ETF is supposed to be announced on Sept 19th, unless they postpone it again. Do they not want news leaking and running up those ETNs? A denial could run it down but they haven't suspended it before for a disapproval so why now? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:24:59
Not at all. The company would just contact you and figure out what you wanted to do. This occurs often with online sales. Just because the company accepts BTC doesn't suddenly mean they become crooks. If they don't have the product they have a number of options. such as refunding you, contacting you to see if you want a newer product in it's place, etc...
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:04:42
It isn't to get rid of retailers. It is another avenue for sellers and manufacturers to save on fees we already pay. I already owe ebay $2400 for the month (well, a few hundred is from going into this month as well) just for listing products on their site, and the commissions for selling them. 
I would love to find a way to save on fees. This would help tremendously.

If some wallet dev would implement it so that it can supply all the information with payment - it would take care of that. I am sure wallets will evolve and improve given time.

I have a refurbished (or new - not sure will explain) R9-280x Sapphire Toxic just sitting around. Here is the story  on it.
I was mining for alt coins, the fans in this one went out. I sent it in and they sent me another one that is either brand new or refurbished and it has never been used at all. They didn't tell me if it was brand new or refurbished, but it is clean as a whistle. Let me know if you are interested in it. I will match any price you find on ebay for a brand new or even refurbished one. If you are interested I can take some pictures and send them to you. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:45:44
You don't have to store your coins with an exchange or wallet service. You don't need them in order to transfer BTC over distance. With fiat, you need banks to facilitate that. The regulations effect a service you don't need to use in order to store/transfer your wealth. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:35:12
Sure, so you think everyone involved with Bitcoin should open another Silk Roads and subject themselves to the same penalties? I speak only for myself, but I am PERFECTLY HAPPY with a legitimate financial instrument that allows me to transfer wealth rapidly while being my own bank. Many people trust banks, and would prefer someone else hold their coins. Those people need consumer protections, hence the regs. Bitcoin is moving in the right direction as far as I am concerned and I appreciate companies like Circle, Coinbase and the like which provides the tools that are necessary for mass adoption.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:32:10
It wasn't that it lost value and lost 1 million dollars, it was that the offer was 1 million under asking. Even the broker told the seller that they are asking for too much for the house. They wanted 14 million for a 2 bedroom house in NY. The broker was telling them that there were not that many people who had 14 million to blow on a 2 bedroom house. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 08:03:21
No, they print their own code on it. Just one unique code per SKU. When you scan it, your payment goes to them for that product. They see the receiving address on a wallet app provides all the shipping information.
@_date: 2015-06-21 21:38:05
The great thing is, if you are unhappy just sell your coins and move on. It doesn't matter what you signed up for because no one is forcing you to stay put. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 06:12:48
To take it a step further,  even sellers could order stickers for each product that says "Time to reorder? Pay with bitcoin" and then the QR code. Slap a sticker on the products they sell on eBay or  Amazon prior to shipping it to the customers. Let's say someone just used the last of that tanning lotion they bought on eBay and are using at the tanning salon. No need to log into the computer when they get home and find the product and seller.  Just scan the code before throwing that bottle in the trash and know another one is on the way to your house.
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:17:06
It would bring down the price of Bitcoin as well. People would lose faith. Right now a lot of nontechies believe the only way they are losing their coins is if they lose their private key. They aren't even considering a chain split which could leave their coins worth less or even worthless altogether. This would make them think about that.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:42:13
If a business can't pony up the $5,000 then they have no business storing other people's money. I have no issue with having regulations that keep wallet and exchange services legitimate. Bitcoin will never evolve if crooks/negligent operators keep stealing/losing other people's money. Only bad news about BTC will spread and keep people from using it. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 08:04:54
I was considering something along the lines of a wallet app that emails the company that it took of the QR code the details after the transaction. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:33:25
Sorry, earlier I had commented that it isn't just for manufacturers. It could be for individual sellers as well. I know other sellers who will already stick their own personal sticker on products they sell on Amazon or ebay that say "To reorder, visit  because their online shopping cart charges them less than Amazon or Ebay. This would reduce costs further.
Edit: " is just a placeholder for their actual website

From the article:
History tends to repeat itself. Right now, it indicates that once the infrastructure needed for institutional investing is built, there will be an inflow of institutional funds into the crypto markets, and that means opportunities like those seen at the dawn of the internet. Whether that map leads to a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow remains to be seen, but when the opportunity of a lifetime presents itself, my opinion is that it’s better to swing and miss than to strike out just observing.
NASDAQ crypto exchange opens June 14 2018 from what I understand. Not a futures platform, but one to buy the underlying asset. A true crypto exchange for institutional investors.

This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but the guy broke the law. Regardless on whether or not he feels those laws should be in place, what he did was criminal. If he wanted to change the laws, he should have gone about it a different way. Laws are put in place for a variety of reasons and bottom line is that if we break them and it can be proven, we are going to suffer the consequences. There are rules we have to live by and when we decide not to, we risk the consequences. It is not up to one person to decide what laws are meant to be followed and who needs to follow them. If it were, there would be complete chaos in our society as you, I, and most likely anyone else I grab off the street can find numerous laws we disagree on. If each of us just did what we believed were right, I honestly would be afraid to live here. 
Edit: As a very small example, our neighborhood does what is called porch pickup sales. They place an ad, someone responds, and the person just puts the item for sale on their porch. The recipient comes over, picks it up and slips the money underneath the mat. One girl recently did this, but when she saw the seller's home she decided the seller did not need the money and she took the clothing and did not pay. When the seller blasted her on facebook (where the community posts these things) the buyer responded that she did not need to pay her because obviously the buyer needed the items and the money much more than the seller. 
People do ridiculous crap and justify it. I can't imagine living in a world where everyone just does what they consider to be right based on their own circumstances.

An example I heard before goes something like this (not related to Bitcoin, but to privacy)
You do a search on symptoms of herpes. The search engine sells this information to various companies. One of the companies is an insurance provider. You try to get health insurance and your rates are higher because they assume you have herpes. 
The example was better written, but that was the basics of it.  There were others as well.

Was on mobile, wasn't trolling or trying to spread FUD. I am being serious. Their business plan doesn't make sense unless they see bitcoin being extremely valuable or they believe they can make it extremely valuable. I am not saying that they cannot, they have some monster companies that are partnering/investing that has changed the world already. I hold BTC, and I hope it can be one of my retirement vehicles. I wanted a real discussion or even a logical reason to stomp my fear that they could be up to something they find more profitable.

I was under the impression that the blockchain could be used to verify that certain devices are the only ones that can authenticate to be used to gain access to other devices or systems. If the IRS had been using it, that would have prevented the hacking wouldn't it?

On mobile so this will be short but hopefully you will understand. Bitcoin is never physically stored anywhere. The paper wallet is simply a set of characters and numbers (your private key) that allows you to move them from address to address. A wallet on you're phone or computer has that private key which allows you to transfer them around. Even if you have the bitcoin in your wallet, that wallet only references the private key. This means if you have it on your wallet and I find the private key I could transfer all those bitcoin without ever accessing your electronics. As long as you have your private key somewhere you can always transfer those funds even if you lost that device.

The problem for me is that on mobile, it gets pretty packed. In the image it looks like there is a lot of room but if a user clicks the PRICE it will change to a total value which could be a larger number that fills most of the space. Also, on individual prices, some of the numbers are really small with a bunch of digits after the decimal. I know there is a solution, I just need to take the time to figure out a good way.

While many of you will think this is bearish, it isn't. It shows a new asset class emerging and gaining popularity so quickly that the most well known US exchange can't keep up with the demand. This will lead to more exchanges competing as well as Coinbase having to improve. Alas, this is good for Bitcoin.

This was released the day future contacts were expiring. It was made to pay the price down.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:01:44
I just checked and it looks like they add up on my end. Maybe we are doing something different? For instance, I entered 100 BTC just now (made up figure) and some other coins. The grand total of all coins is $518,832 of which 100 BTC accounts for 79.8%. I just did the math as well and it is correct based off the cost per BTC currently being displayed.
@_date: 2018-06-15 04:50:14
I agree actually. This report came out the day either of or before the futures contacts were expiring. This report was released to manipulate the price down.

Not paying them a premium. They can do with it what they want.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:02:23
Instead of "The fix is simple: require a mintxfee for each tiny output." as coblee suggests (because certain devs don't want it to be too expensive because they want to use the blockchain for things other than currency) simply prioritize the TX based off the fee charged divided by the number of microtransactions in that transaction. So if someone put 100 mini small outputs in a transaction but only paid $0.08 for that TX, it automaticallly calculates it as $0.0008 fee and will move down the priority chain. Basically the same thing but allows the use of the blockchain without becoming too expensive for those who want to use it other than currency. The difference right now is the miners see this as an $0.08 fee, instead of an $0.0008 fee

Bitcoin was originally created to be a currency. As it developed it was discovered that the blockchain could be used for many other applications. However, without bitcoin there is no blockchain. The currency comes first and foremost. When someone is processing a single transaction as they do when they use it as a currency - the fee they pay is not divided and it receives the priority it requires because using it as a currency require rapid confirmation. But for those applications where each TX has many small outputs and it is not being used for currency, the speed at which it is processed is not as important. It still gets inserted into the blockchain eventually, which is a still a public record that cannot be changed.

I believe he is referring to the monthly crypto purchase as stated above. If I were to rephrase the question I think it would be "If the ETF is only making monthly purchases, what happens if someone buys today and at the end of the month when they make the purchases the price  has gone up considerably?" And I believe the answer would be it doesn't matter because the tokens are purchased in advance but I don't know that to actually be true.

I'm curious how this all plays out. The white paper describes Bitcoin as software which will evolve. When a consumer purchased Bitcoin which is run from open source software they are not purchasing an asset that any one group controls, rather they are purchasing an asset that will follow the longest chain. That's what Bitcoin has always been. If someone isn't aware of that then they have not done there due diligence.

It isn't manipulation. It is market participation. 155M was liquidated on Bitmex on the dump. Downward pressure that had been building for weeks finally overcame the support and it caused a cascading effect as longs were liquidated, forcing them to sell, triggering longs below them, and so on. Same thing happened today except the opposite. Shorts got liquidated. You see these 5% moves because Bitmex allows 100x leverage. It isn't a whale moving the market, it is participants. Sure a whale can give a great big push, but ultimately it is everyone.

Just because your wallet was on your computer doesn't mean anyone at all needed to get into your computer to take your coins. If they somehow got the private key, then they could remove your coins from any computer or internet connected device.
