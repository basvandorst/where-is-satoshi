By my logic I am bringing whatever food I want to my own house and watch movie I bought there. I am not saying that banks are "bad guys" for doing what they do. It's not like people didn't agree to their terms of use. I am just saying how much is Bitcoin better than payment processors we use mostly today.
And about that other point saying why would bank allow competition. Well, let's just say that if their clients want something, they, like any other service, will grant them that. Of course, there are very few of us that want that now, but if more people pressure them, they will have to allow that, because if they don't, someone else will.

Make your own. Or hire CS Student to do so for you (yes, you don't need years of experience and schooling to make one.) I am CS 2nd year student, and made one for myself in about a week. Because every free trading bot is used by many, and thus reducing its effectiveness.

Can you all idiots stop posting stupid things like "Fishing for tips" or "Tip bait?"
If you think he is beggar for tips, don't give him, if you don't, tip him, it's not like he is stealing your bits, it's up to your and everyone elses good will to tip.
Besides, I think all tipping on r/Bitcoin is stupid. We should use it on other subreddits to get more people into bitcoin. If you really think he deserves something, Reddit made reddit gold for that.

Why is everyone here so naive? They would be stupid not to use the advantage of having the whole system in their hands to earn money by trading on their own exchange. So all the time there are more BitstampBTC than real BTC in their wallets, same goes for BitstampUSD vs USD on bank accounts.
