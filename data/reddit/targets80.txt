i would speculate that selling pressure/supply in BFX is the highest it will be right now and will only subside at least in the short term.
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:08:16
BFX should give us a dividend tied to revenue until we're made whole.

people dumped their ETC right away too and it traded up...risk reward seems pretty good IMO.
@_date: 2016-08-26 19:14:04
cant they just buy whatever they think is the next gen?
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:11:16
Functionally what I saw left in my account made me feel inappropriately touched.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:25:19
Don't frown average down
@_date: 2016-04-01 12:05:36
now if we can keep some price stability too...
@_date: 2016-04-01 20:45:38
just the fact that its supposed to be an alternative medium of exchange and its being compared to oil or other countries stock markets shows the problem.

getting to mars vs getting my tesla 3 delivered...the race is on
@_date: 2016-04-11 11:25:23
there will be some irony here if he could have paid for the Tesla with those same 2.5 bitcoins...

something felt weird like a buy algo gone nuts. the premium over other exchanges went parabolic.

Setup a checkbook IRA and do it though that.

they are an investment bank not a hedge fund. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:22:08
Agreed. Much of this semantics, but semantics matters. 
In the end if the investor loses they are probably going to blame anyone but themselves.
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:16:39
fair point, but they are AAA until they are revised to junk. if wealth managers were learned enough and had enough time to analyze the the underlying securities were in fact junk they'd most likely be running a hedge fund.
@_date: 2016-03-31 14:26:30
yes, see volker rule. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 11:35:45
How can you have an AAA rated junk asset? 
 
As an investor if you allocate money to an asset with ~$6.5bn USD and blame the price going down on your wealth manager then you have no business investing in, well, anything.

The friends that I have which are in Bitcoin just own a few as speculators and are sitting on them. In my opinion the price will rise when those same people also start transacting in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-04 13:12:08
Many of the guys trading futures will also be trading options on LedgerX. This may increase underlying bitcoin volume as market makers/traders chose to hedge the derivatives with bitcoin. but as they would be hedging both long and short its not a guarantee the bitcoin price will rise on this alone. that being said its gotta be bullish to have big players jumping in the pool.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:25:03
you think they bother to go into the office?
@_date: 2016-10-06 12:30:45
You're also ignoring the fact that the ones running the game can change the rules at any time. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 14:28:06
at the end off the day they are all using VISA/MC, etc....its more about customer data access on the purchases
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:08:31
i dont think apple will add BTC. retail operations running their own app (walmart, kohls) have a higher incentive to add BTC because their end game is collecting the data not necessarily profiting in the transaction.
@_date: 2016-05-16 16:27:13
if they become more efficient the price can also stay the same, or even decrease and they will still make money. also/or if less miners exist there is less competition to mine.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:08:20
the CC's are definitely skewed to the consumer. As a merchant its really high costs and its frightening that you can do legitimate work or sell a perfectly good product just to have the charge-back later down the road...

GBTC charges a 2% fee too...
@_date: 2016-05-16 12:47:56
investors, right. if you want to speculate on the price of bitcoin then why not just trade bitcoin. mining equipment is a waste of capital if thats the case.
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:21:27
Do I understand this correctly? Small miners drop out, decreasing hash rates making it easier for large miners to generate btc. Why do they have to short of they are compensated with less difficulty? 
@_date: 2016-05-16 18:49:00
so youll quit mining then?
@_date: 2016-05-16 12:27:15
or just making hay while the sun still shines.
@_date: 2016-05-16 12:21:35
if you they do this, then they are not really (just) in the mining business they are in the business of speculation. from a business perspective that seems dangerous.
@_date: 2016-05-16 12:19:30
or they can switch do doing something else, particularly if you are a small scale guy who cant compete. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:42:04
Wait, When did they stop?
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:01:44
i think they are going to just try and sue the GBTC guys for taking their idea
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:01:49
thanks a lot for this - good to know the specifics at to why it didnt work. odd that mycelium support would recommend breadwallet knowing this
