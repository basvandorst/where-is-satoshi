It was right after the CA leak. Bought at $153, sold off most at $215, still have a few shares currently at $173. I’m still up. 
That’s why.

They did a Ninja edit and made you look like a fool. 
Shame on them.

"IT Security is a lot like locking your front door after you've already been robbed"

I wouldn't need them anyways. 
Notice I said successful? Apparently me and my team know what we're doing, and we do it well. 
Edit: Is that really the only response you have to all that I've said?

I am a Professional. I own a successful business specializing in security for small businesses and corporations. 
That is how the pros do it. Of course we have IPS and other methods of detecting and mitigating network attacks. But we aren't talking about those. 
Since I seem to be wrong, please tell me how you're able to know every single possible combination of code in every programming language that can be executed with malicious intent. 
While you're at it, go ahead and explain root kits, malware, spyware, Trojans, and regular old run-of-the-mill viruses. How is that you know exactly what millions of people are currently programming? 
The ONLY way for things to be any different than how I've stated them to be is if you somehow knew of every single exploitable condition on every single system in the world. That includes UNIX, Linux, Windows, Mac, and any other vulnerable OSs. My money says you don't.

I'm not sure what you mean, but the phrase represents how IT Security is handled. We can't fix what we aren't aware of. Unfortunately the only way for us to learn about how to protect against new attacks is to wait until the new attack surfaces. There are so many people with so many computers with so many different methods making these malware/spyware/viruses. 
Once infected, a signature is assigned to malicious code, and your AV software will scan for this specific "flag". But the flags can't be established until we know the threat exists. 
So you got robbed, saw the devastation, and then locked your door.
