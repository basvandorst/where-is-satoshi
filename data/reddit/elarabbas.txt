I couldn't read the text - could someone help me out?

Small amount is useful when all add up.

In fact, I liked him. Maybe he saw something he did not believe - how cryptocurrency being treated?

Please look into Peershares and Peercoin.  Remember that Peercoin nodes can be run on hardware as small as a Raspberry Pi..

Yes, I am also concerned.. But it will take time, and I guess the more open alternatives will then take its place.

There is a video on how to do this. Video is from a Peercoins series, but it still applies to bitcoin:

Sorry, I simply meant that if Bitcoin became more 'closed' due to outside pressures, there would be alternatives that surfaced that would maintain a free and open-source spirit that people would then support..

Found it on a similar thread:
A fix to the software code behind bitcoin won't be ready until next week, according to the lead programmer charged with solving the problem, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the computer-driven virtual currency.
Hackers on Monday began attacking the world's largest bitcoin exchanges to exploit a flaw in the code that could allow users to send false requests to resend payments. The attacks forced the exchanges to suspend customer withdrawals.
The Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange on Monday said it had received fraudulent requests. Bitcoin's core developers later that day discovered a bug within a part of its digital infrastructure. The next morning, hackers exploited the bug and swarmed other exchanges.
The delay in solving the code problem could undermine confidence in the five-year-old virtual currency, which has seen a dramatic run-up in prices in the past year and has begun to gain adoption by a broad swath of merchants.
"It will take two or three days to write the code and longer than that to test it and convince ourselves that we didn't break something else," said Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade organization representing bitcoin-related businesses. Mr. Andresen is head of the five-member team of programmers attempting to fix the problem.
Another member of the team, Jeff Garzik of Atlanta-based payment processor BitPay, has devised workaround solutions for exchanges to clean up and reconcile their bitcoin accounts and restore operations.
In a mark of that effort's slow but deliberate progress, Slovenia-based Bitstamp, the world's biggest bitcoin-to-dollars exchange, announced early Friday it expected to resume processing withdrawals later in the day.
Mt. Gox, for its part, soon will introduce a new identification system for tracking bitcoin withdrawals, a move intended to protect against attack and restore operations, according to a post in a bitcoin developers' chat room by a user identified as Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO. The company couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
It' wasn't clear whether the changes had been implemented at either exchange. Late Friday afternoon, no updates had been made to their websites' respective news streams.
Bitcoin's price rose 8.63% to $650.61 on Friday, according to an index produced by Coindesk comprising prices from Bitstamp and the Cyprus-based BTC-e exchange.
With bitcoin's market capitalization standing at more than $8 billion and thousands of enterprises and digital wallets now hooked into the bitcoin economy, pressure has been strong on the small development team that looks after bitcoin's open-source software.
"One of the real challenges is getting work done when there is a lot of noise," said Mr. Andresen, who described a barrage of requests that flooded in Tuesday, after news of the attack emerged, from anxious merchant payment processors, brokers and digital wallet providers. "There is a real danger of trying to do too many things at once or doing things sloppily. And that is probably the biggest challenge: to try to balance being focused but also listen to what everyone is saying, making suggestions, making complaints, accusations."
On Monday morning, Mt. Gox said individuals had been exploiting a problematic feature of bitcoin's underlying software to trick the exchange into resending bitcoin when payments had already been made. That day, Mr. Andresen put a post on the Bitcoin Foundation's blog declaring that "contrary to Mt. Gox's statement, Bitcoin is not at fault."
But that afternoon, one of the five developers belatedly identified a bug in the code. The next morning a hacker exploited it and sent a barrage of mutated transactions that crippled Bitstamp and BTC-e. According to Mr. Garzik, the hacker took every transaction occurring on the entire bitcoin network and duplicated it under new identification codes, thus overwhelming and confusing the exchanges' computer systems.
