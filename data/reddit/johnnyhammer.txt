Er, you seem to be a little confused. Having a thousand different blockchains is more like having a thousand different Internets.

[The fundraiser you started - and so many jumped on board with -]( is yet another example that the Bitcoin community is not the selfish, heartless gang of profiteers that the MSM paint us out to be.

It wouldn't matter if they paid market value (which incidentally is now around 7% higher than what it was at the start of the day). This is a major player bidding. With that comes the realisation that BTC is a very interesting proposal.

I must say, I am quite jealous of your faith in the senate. I fear that the majority of them have succumbed to the temptations of lobbyists, and this statement is a prime example of someone voicing another's opinion in my view.

**That** is your takeaway from OP's post?
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:34:33
Therein lies the problem. Not every situation calls for the same reaction. If a five year old was waving his father's gun, would you have an issue with three shots to the chest?
@_date: 2014-02-09 12:49:43
Absolutely. But after reading several posts from noonebelievesyou - which by the way are almost exclusively in the sub, and exclusively negative about the potential of the technology - I find it hard to swallow the fact he is giving advice about 'successful' posting.
Surely his is a rather skewed notion of success. All I was doing in highlighting his karma was showing that his inability to garner any kind of popular support for his posts - which I have seen for ones with a negative or 'brutally honest' slant in this sub on several occasions, OP's particular post being one of them - marks his advice redundant.
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:47:28

@_date: 2014-02-09 15:48:27
I wonder what this success is that he speaks of?
Instigating thought-provoking debate? Hmm, very debatable.
Convincing others of his viewpoint through reasoned analysis? Hmm, I'm not sure about that, either.

A minute ago you were laughing about how "lawyers cost more than $150".
Forgive me if I have suspicions that your logic and comprehension are a little skewed. 
Are you telling me that in a country where [a man sued himself because his civil rights and religious beliefs were violated when he allowed himself to get drunk, someone sued his local nudie bar claiming whiplash from a lap dancer's large breasts, and another sued Anheiser-Busch for $10,000 for false advertising because when he drank beer, he didn't have any luck with the ladies, as promised in the TV ads]( a lawsuit about goods promised and not delivered is completely out of the question?
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:20:12
Er, [Each year, 15 million civil cases are filed in the U.S., and 80% of the world's lawyers live in the United States](
It is not really hard to grasp the idea that the chances of being sued in the US are decent, especially in such a public display as this one.
@_date: 2015-07-09 06:47:48
So you are saying he wouldn't have given them the silver if they had chosen it? I don't think so. That's a good way of getting sued. 
If 85 people had chosen silver, that's $12,750 he would have to spend to make this video. Is that very likely in your opinion?

I teach English in Poland and have told three of my adult students about what bitcoin means to the future of money. One is a manager at Citibank and has done some serious investigating into the potential ramifications of the currency. Another is a man with three children, and the third is a single male with cash to burn.
All three have had their eyes opened to this strange new world, and I hope they share the knowledge with others to make Bitcoin more widespread in this country. Fingers crossed!

@_date: 2013-12-26 00:34:30
People who give out BTC believe it is going to boom in the very near future. They want their family members to be a part of that. That is pretty selfless, in my view.
I got a wallet (a 'genuine leather' one, empty at that) and a bar of chocolate and I was over the moon. Once we got all the giving out of the way we sat down and had a great chat. That was the highlight for me - practising my Polish with my wife's grandmas. And them understanding me for once! Looks like the hard work is starting to pay off.

I used to do that too... when I was three.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:50:39
That's a pretty big brush you're wielding...
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:12:46
You were spot on, Matt. I don't know how you keep your cool with everybody constantly swamping you with interruptions.
Looking forward to the next instalment, and never mind the naysayers!
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:30:18
That was another major leap forward. One that surpasses Branson in my view as it was deadly serious. 
Oh, and everyone is right - she was horrible.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:24:33
Ah, good point, but it still stinks heavily of scam to me.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:31:27
How old are you, 12? Jeez, there are some rather large babies in this thread.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:57:33
"I'll take fallacies for five hundred."
"Which currency/payment system has been erroneously likened to a baby filled with beans or a flower *ad nauseum*?"
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:30:50
More videos like this need to get around to the doubters. The transaction seemed so normal, and makes cash appear almost archaic...
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:51:01
Can't vouch for it, but what [about this link?](
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:46:02
You've been called out as having the same IP address. So yeah, makes sense.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:26:14
Well they would, wouldn't they?
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:41:49
Bardzo dobra. Mieszkam w Warszawie, i myślę ze Bitcoin będzie duże tutaj. Mam nadzieję!
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:40:20
That's a pity. I think you should give it another go. There are some truly excellent insights made
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:23:07
Jeez, you've really got a bee in your bonnet today.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:40:34
What do you loathe?
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:29:50
Dziękuję bardzo!
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:53:59
Well, it looks like you already have one wall built.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:24:46
Jeez, go have a cry somewhere else would you?
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:14:56
Try it out. Great sub.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:00:26
So it's not true? It is just a coincidence that the only guy to back you up - the one you can set your watch to - is just a totally unrelated admirer of your philanthropic work on this sub?
My mistake.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:02:41
And he won them over with that argument? Sweet Jesus.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:55:27
Sigh. Never mind then.
Computers were complicated to use once, too.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:44:17
Stop brown nosing, and stop assuming things of others.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:15:50
My dad drowned in a canoe, you bastard.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:10:44
Well, that was positive...
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:59:37
Who the hell is upvoting this idiot? Check his history, please...
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:37:03
Good to know.
Frankly, the best analogy I can think of when it comes to the majority of altcoins is the market for imitation Gucci sunglasses or Rolex watches in South-East Asia. 
They really only serve the purpose of making a fast buck for the vendors, and their customer base falls into two categories - those who don't give a shit that their Cuggi bag is a piece of junk (just as long as it holds together long enough to get back home and sell it to the dimwit next door), or those who are the dimwits (and genuinely believe that Ronex is a solid brand).
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:33:33
Nope... still nothing. Never mind, kept things interesting for a while.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:04:38
Are you going to donate, then?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:14:03
Go, you good thing. Open their eyes to what BTC is...
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:48:56
You will be missed.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:31:47
The writing is on the wall for fiat...
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:21:25
Having a look might not hurt, but keep it down to the bare minimum - say Litecoin and at a stretch, Namecoin.
TBH I think that dredging up twelve different coins and treating them as if they have the potential to seriously challenge Bitcoin (tip, most are just ripoffs with barely any  substantial difference to BTC) can have the potential to make cryptocurrencies look, well, a little foolish. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:51:01
Yeah, you would. You are the same guy.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:06:49
Oh, yes. Sorry, totally forgot the entire premise of the game...
"I'll take making a large mistake for a thousand, thanks."
"Johnny Hammer"
Although I could have gotten away with it if I had said that it was the same person saying both things. Dang.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:04:38
What's with people putting the dollar sign after the figure? It's very annoying.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:41:00
Calm down. If consistently hitting the front pages of numerous news sources isn't heading towards the mainstream, then fuck knows what is.
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:12:50
You are not in marketing, are you?
@_date: 2013-12-24 12:12:39
What nonsense.
Because you don't advertise to all and sundry that you did a good deed makes it seem shameful? What a time we live in. Truly the 'look at me' generation.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:59:51
Grandchildren? You need a woman to get some of those.
See you in a few hours.
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:47:04
That may be, but you are not.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:00:34
Nice IP address.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:11:40
Really? You can't move a decimal point three places?
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:18:51
That was hilarious
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:12:52
Hmm, feel a song coming on:
Your old road is rapidly ageing.
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand...
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:01:17
Err, a little too much vitriol there...
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:14:28
Is bitstamp any good/trustworthy? They are asking for photo ID and proof of residence, and I just want to know if that is a good idea.
I am very interested in getting in on this, it seems like the way forward to me...
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:34:50
Not in China.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:26:07
What a load of shit. These guys are getting pretty good though, I will admit.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:47:58
A major point here is the worth of the gift, also. Wouldn't they have thought the same about getting 25 BTC a year ago? What would they think now?
If that is what we call selfish these days, I had better grab my dictionary and reread the definition.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:33:35
Stop saying ***we***.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:41:25
Then they are rather more selfish than the guy. In my opinion, of course.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:08:42
Probably because you come across as full to the brim of shit. Nothing personal.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:16:41
Says the guy who thinks a movement to turn off a few lights for an hour will destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:48:42
Go for it. Just don't ask anyone else to go in with you.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:44:27
If you think 20% is a low figure, you don't know much about startups.
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:18:10
Yep. Batshit.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:26:16
Yes, we are currently at that stage. Exciting, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:20:23
And they would do the same for anything I gave them. Yes, that includes BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:50:44
To jest prawda. Chyba Google Translate jest łatwiej niż uczysz Polska język, tak?
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:29:00
Dziękuję bardzo! I'll ship it on at some stage to someone worthy...
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:26:36
Ow, the comments section hurt my brain in so many different ways...
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:18:21
On the way back. Don't you worry.
Looks like I'm as shit as you are at predicting the markets.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:53:07
Dziękuję bardzo!
@_date: 2013-12-28 11:24:58
Is it just me, or does the use of the word 'butthurt' instantly invalidate everything the user has said or will say from that point on?
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:04:55
I don't think anything else would get through to the ardent naysayers faster than a few BTC getting tossed their way. 
Great call.
@_date: 2013-11-04 13:37:38
Ok, I am definitely a candidate for inclusion in the MM thread. Here goes:
* Downloaded my Bitcoin-qt client.
* Bought a Bitcoin from Localbitcoins.com. Transaction succeeded, so now I have 1 BTC. Excellent.
* Wanted to put it in an offline cold wallet for safety, so went to bitaddress.org, saved site on my computer, then went offline.
* Created a brain wallet, then printed it out.
* Went back online and sent 0.0001 BTC to the public address of the paper wallet. Wanted to send less, but found there was a minimum. Also discovered the fee attached to sending from bitcoin-qt. Eeep!
* Went on Blockchain.info after making the transaction. Sure enough, the paper wallet's public address that I typed in showed a balance of 0.0001 BTC. Not bad, the system seems to work.
* Went back to my Bitcoin-qt client and [followed these instructions]( in order to gain access to the paper wallet's balance.
Now I want to follow the same steps to generate a paper wallet with a bigger amount, minus the last step (in order not to expose the private key to my computer).
The question is: am I missing anything in the way of security by following these steps? Are there any fundamental flaws in what I have done?
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:57:22
You are the one who brought 'shame' into the equation here. I just stated how I feel about people who feel the need to tell the world about the money they've just donated.
I love a feel good story as much as the next man, but where I come from we keep things a little closer to our chests. Again, just a matter of taste.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:44:05
What a hero.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:01:29
Loving that Freudian slip.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:11:08
Got my vote.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:00:59
You have to be kidding me. Who is upvoting this shit?
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:49:46
I believe you.
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:42:01
Your family is very different to mine. If I knitted them all scratchy Bart Simpson underwear they would say thank you.
Oh, and Chinese Yen???
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:55:43
That is quite an uncomfortable place to be in. This is why being armed with a few unshakeable facts about Bitcoin comes in handy.
As for who S.M. is, the best answer to that is it doesn't matter, because it boils down to two words: open source.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:00:47
You have a serious amount of time on your hands.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:34:30
Nice pumping there.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:05:38
Or possibly @_date: 2013-12-02 03:10:29
You were saying?
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:48:42
I don't know, but is [this any good?](
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:14:31
What are you majoring in? Limp-wristism or pan handlism?
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:04:30
Yeah, *found*.
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:48:16
Aha. Thanks for that. I think I'll be looking a little deeper into this whole BTC thing
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:40:01
You're right. Probably more to do with ruling over a bunch of kindling than anything else.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:10:01
Just went down his history to the very bottom of the pit. Found such niceties as this:










Raving mad.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:56:39
Total madman.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:17:30
The only believable thing about this post is that you sound like you've had too much coffee.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:03:23
Zzzzz. Come back in a few hours time, you tit.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:14:37


I find it hard to take you seriously when you state that you actually believe the guy was 80.
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:38:21
What's the weather like over there right now?
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:22:53
And cars, hydroponic equipment, kevlar, gloves, glass cutters, scissors, knives, box cutters, bolt cutters, balaclavas, kerosene, rope, basements, attics, and everything else that can be used for nefarious purposes. Shame. 
God help humanity in the face of this onslaught.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:50:43
And your vested interest is in what, exactly?
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:06:04
Made me laugh, just like those Japs are always doing.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:01:57
Because he was from Iran. Is that you, Mr Bush?
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:24:25
So what, he has to bring it back to the fundamentals every episode just in case someone doesn't know what Bitcoin is and how to use it?
Sounds repetitive.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:58:31
Is it later yet?
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:02:44
Wow. Some idiots in the comments section of the Guardian. Classic fallacies being rolled out...
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:23:01
Let's not and say we did.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:11:14
You sounded pretty damn creepy right there.
@_date: 2013-12-29 11:20:06
The human race?
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:42:29
Help what?
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:33:53
That was a moment I'll long remember. Great time to be alive...
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:11:04
Absolutely. I nominated it in the "best post" section or whatever it is at the top of @_date: 2013-12-10 21:07:14
Er, ever heard of the phrase "defeating the purpose"?
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:17:33
Call me sceptical, but... I'm sceptical of this.
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:27:19
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:10:47
This is a great show and it should get more recognition, methinks...
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:48:06
That wasn't a joke.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:43:30
Yours for only 16 trillion Klowncoins.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:34:48
Er, I stand by my initial assessment. It was the gambling that got this ball rolling. I didn't read "I'm going to kill myself because Bitcoin went down to $800", and neither did you.
Who knows, it's possibly a scam for donations anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:36:12
Excuse me, but since you view being a homosexual lord as a slur, perhaps the problem is yours?
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:20:56
Forget everything you have read. [This is the winner, right here]( 
Just a breathtaking piece of comedy gold.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:26:43
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:31:57
Nothing wrong with localbitcoins.com.
Also, what's the go with tax in Aus? Anyone looked at jumping through those hoops yet?
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:51:56
I don't think so.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:25:17
Not everyone thinks Christmas is a time to cash in, you know. Good food, family, shitty carols, arguments over Monopoly...

Speaking of lying, how's your girlfriend's brother?

Do you know who you are replying to? This guy is the ultimate FUD spreader in this subreddit.
Check out his history for a good chuckle.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:57:23
Quick, go check to see if he's on the computer.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:18:04
Hi Darkwings_08. Using your other one today, I see.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:59:03
That wasn't an assumption. That was an observation of something that happened.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:27:45
What the hell are you on about, Darkwings?
@_date: 2013-12-23 13:51:35
Again, superbly handled. I hope after the 12 days are up that Matt continues to open eyes.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:29:01
Great post, and it echoes exactly what I've been going through over the last few months.
This is the best kind of education, and I would add another point to your list. The generosity shown by bitcoiners to their fellow man, for instance: 
tips to start new people going in the topsy-turvy world of BTC, donations to victims of natural disasters, tossing coins at Sean's Outpost like they're going out of fashion (and as we all know, they are going anywhere but...), the list goes on.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:11:37
A week? This is BTC we are talking about? Try within five hours.
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:39:46
The only difference here is we are dealing with family. I don't know about you, but I trust mine not to try to rip me off.
Plus the wallets were **gifts**. Nobody was selling anything, were they?
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:41:56
Well, I would have...
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:42:39
You mean the same people who use fax machines to send threats?
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:30:01
What a fucking grabby family. How about be grateful for the thought instead of saying "what the fuck is this and how much is it worth?"
And how about learning about something new for a change?
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:34:40
Calm down.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:41:46
I knew you were going to say that.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:03:43
You have officially lost the plot.
And still no evidence, I see.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:27:02
Oh, how disappointing...
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:08:04
Perhaps he is a little miffed that the guy is making love to his sister right about now? Just a guess.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:57:52
No redistribution possible, niestety.
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:53:09
Hmm. Sketchy. To say the least...
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:01:53
That's right. Now get off it!
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:27:28
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:39:11
You definitely need a woman.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:31:51
That's funny, because all of my family **are** like this. Maybe I'm lucky.
Oh, and if you gave me something that I didn't understand right away, do you know what I'd say? "Thanks very much. Now tell me all about it..."
This all reminds me of the family out of Million Dollar Baby:
"Why did you buy me a house? Why didn't you just give me the money?"
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:19:03
Nice try, Darkwings.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:04:36
How long is a piece of string?
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:11:24
Piss off, Wiesenthal.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:01:29
Fuck up, Darkwings jr.
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:32:11
Smug, condescending, uninformed talking heads picking over what they think are the bones of Bitcoin.
Hurry up, evolution, and put these dinosaurs to bed.

Start with your parents, after naptime perhaps...
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:14:07
He could still be making love to his sister, no?
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:57:38
Who the Jews killed, by the way...
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:10:33
Oh, my. Shed a tear...
Good riddance to part-time speculators.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:51:55
Sorry to say, but yes I believe that things are falling into place to make Bitcoin a huge player in the coming years. Foresight is often mocked out there in the real world, and it sounds like it is getting mocked here.
Maybe it's just me, but if my brother or whomever gave me a doohickey and told me - with honest, straightforward belief in is face - "this is the future right here", I wouldn't hesitate to thank him and listen to why he thinks so.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:36:26
Ok, sorry. Let me put it this way. When people first started getting Rubik's cubes for Christmas they didn't know how the fucker worked, but learning sure was fun.
@_date: 2013-12-24 12:25:21
Sean's Outpost is well-known, widely respected, and has three posts about its great cause on the front page already.
It is just my personal opinion that being such a broadcaster of one's own good deed somewhat cheapens the notion that it was done strictly to help others (whether via a new account or not). Maybe I'm behind the times here...
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:16:39
Jeez, get off his back why don't you, you  armchair charity worker?
Let me guess, you would have given up the whole amount right?
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:11:15
Again, no foresight. Don't have to wait a year. Shit, it's gone up about $40 in the last few hours.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:32:21
No, I saw that. I was implying that sqig was making a fine fist of  impersonating Darkwings, if he isn't in fact one and the same...
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:09:39
That's going in the BTC museum one day
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:23:46
A truly excellent move.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:39:36
Are you still not banned?
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:50:09
Sigh. I don't know why I will bother with this... but I guess I will.
Emblazoned across the top of your post is the following:




But it's not "bullshit" - as you so succinctly put it - it is a fact. That is the current market cap, based on the current price of a Bitcoin. If you want to educate folks on what a market cap is, how about toning down the rhetoric - as well as the posts to buttcoin.com or whatever it was - and post a reminder to those whom you believe may be mistaken.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:37:41
I think if they took a look at the charts right now they might be rather happy.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:42:07

That is a hell of a piece of art. 
Makes you think how big this thing of ours could be...

What a cocksucker. That's a compliment, by the way.

If you don't like totalitarian regimes, then stay away from that Maoist Barroso, that wolf in sheep's clothing Van Rumpoy, and all their bureaucratic cronies.

@_date: 2013-12-19 19:29:29
What are you talking about?

I'll keep spreading the word over here, that's for sure. Makes you feel good to be part of something that is only just getting off the ground, doesn't it?

Big if.

Ok Darkbadger. 
Hmm, catchy.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:29:55

I think you are having trouble with your dates. That other one was eight months ago.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:55:20
No, [not me](
You are getting weirder by the post.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:59:22
Worse.
