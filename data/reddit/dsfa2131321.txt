no idea what your comment means. opening a company is just a way to get an account that's 'resident' wherever you want it to be, legally.

If you have a french bank account you can buy a decent amount (up to $2000/day and $10000/mo) on kraken.com without needing ID. Generally though most exchanges do need ID.

not really, but there is  - never tried it, but it might be what you're looking for.

this is a pretty good answer to the "why blockchain" question

she's not wrong about that either.

interesting question.. I guess it maybe depends if you're importing the BTC into australia..  .. gst still applies to digital goods too which might cover bitcoin;  - but it seems to be kraken's job to charge the tax and give it to australia, not yours.

ask your bank for an overdraft.

One way would be to open a company outside India (ie, in the US or maybe Europe), get a bank account for it, get corporate bitcoin exchange account.

bitstamp.net or maybe zyado.com - there's also bitcoin.de

localbitcoins.com cash deposit transcations often aren't that bad of a premium..  
I would still recommend renewing your passport, and/or getting a driving license though.

any of these are a much worse option than withdrawing to your bank account and sending from there.

I would recommend not trying to use your debit card. Sign up on  and send a SEPA EUR transfer instead.   may work, or possibly 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:43:50
this is the best way

usually they're buying small amounts so while the markup is large percentage wise it might be under $10 in fees and they just don't really care 'cause they want btc and don't want to supply any ID so they can feel safe buying drugs  on the darknet.

venmo doesn't allow reversal, but they can't stop people's banks taking the money back from venmo (when the user claims it was fraud) and then they take it back from you and close your account.

It isn't possible without a hardfork.. so original bitcoin would still exist, just that it would be abandoned by core.. maybe everyone else would abandon it too, or maybe not.

it's usually just a normal bank transfer in your online banking.

there's an option when you actually make the payment (rather than when adding the payee).. also make sure you are sending from your EUR account not your GBP one.. your failed payments will probably be sent back eventually but it might take a week.
