Surely. But when Bitcoins have no other purpose than to either serve as a currency, a proxy for currency or a store of value. You'd be naive to push that argument or rely on it to avoid keeping up with compliance. You can't smoke Bitcoins, or fashion jewelry out of them.

Everything has to be interpreted by the zealots as trampling on their freedom. No need to let facts get in the way.

The tragedy of the commons applies to BTC, is the problem. Nothing will be "done" about it because Noone controls BTC. The insertion of CP was a profound and powerful move to illustrate a fundamental flaw of the system. Complete irreversibility and lack of *any* regulation.

You completely confuse the issue.
Point 1: The key to Bitcoin's acceptance as a currency, and not just as a money transfer alternative or as an anonymizing bridge for illicit transactions is stability, not significant exchange value.
Point 2: Significant value of Bitcoin serves only as a testament to the speculative potential people attribute to it. This is because Bitcoin is a currency with a finite supply, which lends itself to an attractive commodity to hoard, hence the hoarding behavior.
The reality is that Point 2 works against Point 1. If you really believe in Bitcoin you should hope that it bottoms out at a value in near parity to the dollar and then stays there for a long period of time, not that its value should  rise.

Ahh, that makes sense. K&amp;E NY? I summered there

How cute that the Bitcoin faithful are running to tout the questionable validity of Bitcoin as a currency, as a defense. Can't have it both ways. MTGox was created to make money (and lots of it) running an exchange.

Right, but the to qualify for Reg D exemption, the sales must be only to accredited investors. Complying with this is no small feat, as it requires the company to peer into the net worth (and other attributes) of those buying the securities.

People he is laying this out for you in complete clarity. Listen.

Why would you accept a "currency" that can half its value, from the time a customer pays you to the time he's walking out the door 10 feet away?
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:17:18
Then you tacitly accept the fact that you are a slave and do nothing about it. Why?

Great. Sounds like your K&amp;E attorney is earning her keep!

Yet, they are the best this "paradigm shift" can muster up, despite repeated displays of staggering incompetence.

It's hilarious to see all this the evangelism of Bitcoin as the future of currency, yet a thread needs to be created to brainstorm how to even procure them.

Zing. Just what I was going to say. He showed in those few sentences that has has no idea what authority even means.

True but Mt Gox made it down easy for them. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:49:22
But how can it be? Poor lil' Mt. Gox are the good guys, and we have to cut them endless slack!
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:31:02
Please. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:43:35
How?

The effect of a tragedy of the commons is that no single actor will behave in a beneficial manner for the larger group because the assumption is that "someone else" will do it, despite the better outcome for all (including them) if this action is taken. This is precisely what is happening here.
Everyone speaks of the need for more liquidity, better promotion of Bitcoin and efforts towards widespread adoption, yet Bitcoin continues to languish as a disjointed/unfocused smattering of a "currency" nearly 4 years after its inception because the noone wants to burden themselves with the infrastructural efforts to achieve the abovementioned goals that will ultimately help them (and everyone else in the BTC community) in the long term. Why? Because the system as it currently is - a volatile rollercoaster ripe for profits made on speculation - benefits them in the short term.
Everyone heralds BTC as the new paradigm shift of money transmission, but proceeds to perpetuate the unstable casino that it is.




This was profound because it injected something that is arguably on its face, criminal to have in posession. Bible verses, leaked cables, or some Satoshi quote about bail outs aren't.

So confidence inspiring. What firm did your GC leave to cone start? I'd question the wisdom of such a departure and the gargantuan professional liability she has taken on. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:40:09
Right. As you play the Mt. Gox casino.

I like how you make a bold declaration regarding its stability and then carve out the monumental devaluation that has just occurred, like its nothing big.
