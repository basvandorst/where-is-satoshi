How thick is your titanium plate ? Aliexpress may be a solution if you can find the right supplier who actually sells the grade you want and has no problem with shipping only 2 or 4 plates. The whole process involves a bit more though (binding posts, cover, holes, laser engraved lines, a metal box, punching set etc.) so Coldbit's price will be a bit higher.

The point is the tests should be a bit over the top, pushing the material to the limit. I also believe Cryptosteel (and its clones like Billfodl) design is flawed. Its 1mm thick steel bends in your hands quite easily and the letters can fall out when the whole thing is under stress. Another point is you can get a much tougher design for similar price, eg. r/ or r/

Hand engraving with an engraving machine isn't as deep as punching with a 2kg hammer, eg. it is fairly easy to remove the engraving with a sand paper (same for laser markers). I wouldn't bet my life on laser engraving being still 100% visible after spending years in tough conditions. A dremel with the right endmill could do the job but first you need a dremel with the right endmill, an angle grinder or a metal cutter and potentially some belt grinder to polish the metal :) The benefit of a dremel is you can engrave anything you want. The downside is it takes a long time and patience.

Trezor supported Segwit a few weeks or so after activation. Trezor is a tiny company compared to Coinbase and they managed to write code that handles Segwit addresses and implement everything else related to that because they got their shit together and are preparing for what's coming months before. Segwit had been for a couple of years in testing, it's not like they couldn't prepare the code before activation. Coinbase are putting out fires most of the time.

Maybe talk to your neighbours up front and explain that the banging will only take 30 mins? If not you should be able to find an area nearby with a raised concrete surface (eg. stairs outside) and punch the seed there. With regards to storing the passphrase I suggest NOT STAMPING it on the plate (in case someone steals your wallet). There is space for it, however, if you wish to stamp it (about 16 letters).

I can start offering number punching sets if enough people are interested (say 20). Just curious - the format you'd use for the private key would be just a very long number, a mixture of uppercase letters and numbers or would you need both lower and upper case letters and numbers ? How many characters would you need ? How would you lay it out on 12 rows ?

"Bogart: We've pegged the odds at less than 25%. That's because the very first thing the SEC lists in its own mission statement is protecting the investing public. When you think about the game theory aspect of this, if I work at the SEC and I approve this ETF and it goes well, nobody is probably going to come around and pat me on the back and give me a promotion. But if I approve it and a lot of money flows into it and something goes wrong, I'm likely to lose my job." - to hedge against losing the job the person(s) can invest a large sum in BTC and then approve.

You obviously don't understand how centralizing forces work. No, you won't "buy your own datacener" with bitcoin you own. You'll either sell it all along the way to the moon or spend it on things you need. You don't buy servers now to let Reddit operate, you just rely on someone else provide the service and you accept the problems (censorship and ownership of data) associated with it. Same applies to Facebook, Google etc.
So the future of big blocks in Bitcoin doesn't mean current hodlers operating their own dataceters because that's never happened and never will. Humans never pay for something if it can be provided for free by someone else. When running a node consumes an equuvalent of a full salary you can be sure node operators won't be individuals but companies. Initially a lot of small companies but over time the big players swallowing the small ones. If you want to imagine how it will look like just observe what happened with the Internet services (websites, socia) over the years. It's become very centralised with just s few key players providing useful services to the rest and making the rest depend on them. You can imagine similar few Bitcoin service providers completely dominating the landscape of Bitcoin payments. You'll have to use their nodes because you won't be able to run your own. If they want to censor your transactions they will be able to. 
Now it is individuals running nodes at home on regular PCs and it's distributed exactly because the cost is so neglible they can afford it.

It is not underpowered. The 4 core, 1 GB of RAM Pi has been running for the past 5 months without *any* crashes. It's true that the initial sync might take 2-3 weeks but after that it's capable of being a full node and helping the network.

During the initial sync it takes a few weeks download and verify all the blocks. During that time the 1GB of RAM Pi will likely run out of memory. I believe that's what he means by a "crash".

I still don't understand how this will enable massive scale of transactions between millions of people.

I assumed the elliptic curve multiply speed and used addresses lookup to be negligible compared to PBKDF2. It most likely isn't completely negligible but isn't too far off as u/jcoinner pointed out in the comment above. The wild ass ballpark figure of 200,000/passphrases/second/GPU for both PBKDF2 + EC multiply + address lookup is (at least theoretically) possible. No GPU optimised code exist for it yet but it's a matter of time before someone finds cracking BIP-39 passphrases profitable (because of found seed backups or physical access to hw wallets).

My full node gets a new ip address daily. Dynamically assigned ips are a common practice by broadband providers in Europe.
A better approach imho would be to mark dynamic ip nodes and keep track of the number of days a node has been reachable at a given ip address. If a node is reachable at the same ip for more than 1 month we assume it's a static ip node. All other nodes are dynamic and we have to adjust the total node count by not including them all but a fraction only. You add up all the nodes reachable for 1 day and divide by 28 (to get 4 weeks stats). Then all nodes reachable by 2 days and divide by 14 etc.

I don't know if this is a joke or real but **you should never store your BIP39 passphrase together with the seed**. This defeats the purpose of the passphrase in the first place.

I'd recommend using [BIP39 passphrase]( not just when moving but as a general, easy to setup method of protecting your coins from physical theft of the metal wallet. You should not stamp the passphrase next to the seed of course. Other methods include splitting the seed using OTP or Shamir Secret Scheme and using different locations/travel routes for each split share.

I used a 1.5kg hammer to stamp the seed on ColdTI and you can clearly see the marks. Similar marks appear on 2mm titanium. You need at least 3mm titanium if you want to properly stamp seeds (like with a hammer and not an engraving pen) and not have any curl or marks on the back. What did you use to stamp your seed ?

It's AISI 304 stainless austenitic steel. It doesn't respond to magnetic field (test using a simple magnet). All other types of steels such as the precipitation hardening, martensitic, duplex and Ferritic stainless steels are sensitive to magnet fields. It is corrosion resistant. You can sprinkle it with water, leave in open air and no rust will be formed. Nitric acid reaction. When non-stainless steels are affected by nitric reaction, a pungent brown fume is generated. Test by placing a drop of strong nitric acid (careful, it's corrosive and harmful to skin). You can also measure the wallet, calculate its volume and check if the density matches (it should be 7.9 kg/dm3 at 20C room temperature for 304 steel). [

ColdTI is small and affordable but 1.5mm titanium will warp after stamping. You'll be able to see letter marks on the back side. [ Can someone guess your seed words just by looking at the marks ?
