Exactly. Only faith will restore Bitcoin to its rightful glory.

That guy was a scammer. He gave crypto a bad name. He is the devil at work, trying to waylay righteous believers.

That's why I'm HODLing — no one is going to be buying the asset from me. No one can take my money. If we work together and HODL, it's no longer zero-sum, it becomes a positive sum game. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:15:19
You should buy back now and hodl.

Billionaires are billionaires. Bill Gates is a billionaire; he lives in a giant mansion. No one says "he's just a billionare on paper." That doesn't even make sense. In this country, if you're a billionaire, you're a billionaire. You can do whatever you want. End of story. 
Plus, that's the beauty of Bitcoin and HODling. You don't need to cash out. You can just enjoy the wealth without converting to corrupt fiat. Bitcoin is currency, the only pure kind, and shall be used itself. We HODLers will prosper because in the new world, only we will have this noble gold; and with it, we, not the crooked bankers, will have the power. You too can join us, there is still time.

Yeah but guess what, he wins in the end and the bear dies. This is all a test: 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:51:51
Which is why you just have to use faith. 
It's all a test: 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:12:46
How strong is your faith? I can take it if it lasts 10 years. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:16:43
No, we all hodl together. That's how we will get wealthy — with each other's help.

Exactly. Upvote my post and spread the word:

I worship the golden coin. And with time, all will come to know its name. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:23:04
That makes no sense. If everyone bought, Bitcoin value would go through the roof. How is that not helping each other?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:55:09


You're thinking about today. I'm thinking about the future. 


Bitcoin is already out. No one can stop it. 


New ones will form. Believers cannot be silenced. Tyrannical governments have tried in the past, and they have been hanged, beheaded, and overthrown. 


Merchants would fight back. They already accept crypto in growing numbers. 


Those guys can only victimize the nonbelievers. True HODLers will be immune. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:35:30
That's not a true governmentless society. A true governmentless society would have no wars. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:18:35
Exactly. Upvote my post and spread the word: 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:00:10
If you **sell**, then you're a **sell-out**.  And no one likes sell-outs. Only faith is rewarded. We all must be strong and HODL, and spread the word of **buy** so that our friends and family can join us in the properity. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:37:53
Good point. Everyone should jump. It's all a test: 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:08:36
Exactly. Upvote my post and let's spread the word: 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:43:05
Yeah, to enslave them.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:45:57
What you call religious, I call faith. And faith will always be rewarded.
You simply don't have faith in this new, better world. And your lack of faith will be repaid in kind the day judgement comes.

By your example, they didn't help each other. The guy who sold at 1k is not a true believer. That's why he took the money of the guy who bought at 15k. 
If he was a true believer, he would HODL, and the guy who buys at 15k would also HODL, and together they would become millionaires eventually. That's what I meant by helping each other. That's how the Winklevoss Twins became **billionaires**.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:33:50
He would if we all bought and HODLed. He would be part of the new elite.
