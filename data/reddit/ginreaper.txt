For the record there is such a thing as like growth potential and market cap so you know some stocks are safer but they're probably not going to grow that much more where's you get risky stocks to the small-cap. They could grow a lot over 10 years for me I'm holding

so all you need to do is send your BTC to yourself at a new address after the BTC2X fork, then that address wouldn't be on the BTC2X chain right? then you are protected?

right but you could have 1000 bajillion hashes per kWh but if the difficulty is set right (so blcoks happen every ~10 mins on average), it doesn't matter

bitcoin is fiat too

Fair enough, except not everyone lives in a 3rd world country with very risky currencies. Sure the USD is fucked in the long run, but i'll be sleeping safely tonight knowing that if the US backed currency crashes everyone else is fucked along with me
