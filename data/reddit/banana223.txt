True. It just seems like people in this thread seem to think that as long as you don't "cash out", but make a gain and re-invest, then you only need to pay tax at the very end when you finally "cash out", even if that's years from now.

Short term gains is not 15%. 15% is the long-term, federal capital gains tax. If you sold now, you'd pay your regular federal tax rate of 25% on all gains.

In the lower box where it shows your current orders, there's a button that says "fills". It will show every buy and sell you've done, with the amount and price.

No, you don't have control over your bitcoins until the transactions are completely approved. You could probably get a wire transfer in today, which would allow you to buy on GDAX right away. Their cutoff is 1PM PST for having the transfer added to your account the same day, but the fees would be about $35.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:38:24
When you buy on coinbase, your bitcoins are stored on coinbase. You could send them to another wallet, but right now transactions have very high fees so it might be worth it to wait, or just hold your bitcoins in your GDAX/Coinbase wallet (not recommended long-term).
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:31:03
Coinbase/GDAX is your best option. Depending on how much you want to buy, and how long you're willing to wait to buy, you have a few ways of doing it. You can link a credit card, and instantly buy, I think, up to $100. There's also an identity verification process that may or not be backed up right now due to all the new people interested. It's also Friday, so that can make things slower for bank transfers.
If you buy bitcoins with an ACH transfer, you "lock in" the price you bought them at, but you dont have control over the bitcoins until the transaction clears. So you could buy $2000 worth and sit there for a week watching the price change and you can't do anything about it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, if you're new to bitcoin, you force yourself to not panic sell the moment it drops below what you paid. And realistically, you shouldn't be planning on trading them after buying them unless you're experienced with investing and are utilizing bots.

Don't sell your bitcoins every week just to turn a bitcoin price increase into profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:26:33
It is. But it's a good way for new users to get bitcoins quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:53:44
You CAN hold your coins in an exchange, but generally you want to have full control over your own coins by moving them to your own wallet. There's also the side benefit to this that it makes you less likely to panic sell since you have to do more effort than just hitting the sell button on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:21:10
Your transaction on GDAX could not "take a while". You create a sell order for a certain price. It is either filled, or it isn't. Market price sells can change because you're saying "sell at market price even if it goes up or down" but you'd need to be selling a lot of bitcoins to notice anything.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:19:14
Because on-chain BTC transfers aren't exactly easy right now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:59:20
This is bad math. You will never "lose money" unless you sell, pay CGT for the year, and then bitcoin drops below what you re-bought it for and never rises above it again. And then... you're losing money because the price of bitcoin, not taxes. Since the taxes you are paying are based on what you originally paid, your future CGT will be based on what you paid when you bought back in. For people in the US, there's one, and only one way to pay more in tax for the same amount of gains, and that is by selling less than 1 year after buying.
Example: You buy in at $5000. 1 Bitcoin.
You sell at $19000. That's $14000 in gains. 25% tax rate = $3500 in taxes, so you have $15500 to buy back in with.
You buy back in at exactly $15500, and so you still have 1 bitcoin (for simplicity). You have gained $0, and 0 bitcoins, and seems like a wash, except that NEXT TIME you sell, you're paying gains based on buying in at $15500, instead of $5000.

Coinbase supports the Czech Republic. There are also other options, but I'm in the US, so I really only have experience with exchanges that support the US, which really doesn't leave many options. Still, if you're new, Coinbase is a good option.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:05:18
Nope. Every time you exchange bitcoins (or other crypto) for anything, you need to pay tax. Including buying something with crypto, or exchanging to other crypto, or buying/selling. Including within the same exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:14:22
Wire transfer to GDAX. Instantly isn't quite accurate, but you still have a little while to potentially get your money in today since their cutoff is 1PM PST. The more you transfer, the lower percentage the fees are. Should be about $35 total in fees, so less than 1% of $5k
Depends on your bank though. They have to GET the wire transfer by 1PM, not just have  you request it with your bank before 1PM.

Buy ETH on GDAX, transfer to Binance, exchange for MIOTA

Click the "limit" tab, enter the amount you want to sell, the price you want to sell at, and click place sell order. A limit order is about as simple as it gets. It's basically just saying "I'm willing to sell my bitcoins for this price". The graph you see below the price graph is all limit orders. When someone is willing to buy at the same price you're willing to sell, it gets filled.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:24:36
Wire transfer. Not economic in terms of fees for small transfers, since the fee is fixed at 35ish dollars depending on your bank. But on a business day, before 1PM PST will clear same day.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:17:12
Yeah, if you buy with an ACH transfer on coinbase, even if the price skyrockets, you'll get the amount of bitcoins you bought at the time. The only thing I'm not sure about is who they consider to control the coins for the purposes of something like a fork, if it were to happen during the transaction wait period, but that's a very rare thing and you'd know in advance whether it would come up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:22:08
Anyone who pretends they can answer this is guessing. We could have seen the peak, or it could spike massively over the next month or two. In terms of short-term gains, it's a gamble. Long-term, whether you buy at 17k or 8k, you'll very likely see profit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:04:09
In his example, he made a 100% gain. So half of everything is gains. Half of what he withdraws is initial investment, half is gains.

Don't buy on Coinbase, buy on GDAX. Add money to your USD wallet on coinbase, transfer the money to GDAX (it's instant), and then either do a market buy and pay a small fee, or a limit buy for a couple cents below the current price and pay no fee, assuming it gets filled.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:10:02
You don't pay a miner fee when buying and selling within an exchange. The fees are for having your transaction included in t he blockchain. A third party, like an exchange, moving BTC between accounts doesn't require anything other than changing a value in their database.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:27:31
It's not, obviously. Unfortunately, you are not capable of consistently buying low and selling high. Over time, you'll lose to bots. Pretty much guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:19:45
Coinbase isn't an "exchange" exactly. Coinbase's exchange platform is GDAX. You can deposit money into coinbase, and transfer it to GDAX instantly, and buy with no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:08:36
A limit is for selling when the price goes up, and buying when the price goes down. It wouldn't make sense to put a limit order to sell below the current price, because there is already an existing buy order at that price. You'd instantly have your order filled, and it would be BELOW current market price.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:19:44
Stops are for selling when the price goes down or buying when the price goes up. Since if you put in a limit order to buy above the market price, it would be filled instantly, and same with a sell order below the market price. In very simple terms, a stop order executes a market order to buy or sell when the price hits a number you set.
That's assuming you meant GDAX and not Coinbase. If you're trying to use Coinbase to daytrade... stop. Also, probably just don't bother trying to play the market at all if you aren't aware of what a stop is already.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:31:11
Regular stop order is a market price buy/sell if the price hits X. A stop with a limit means that when the price hits X, a limit buy/sell will be placed for Y.

This exact question is in the FAQ in the sidebar. But on the most basic level, the fact that bitcoin provides a way of securely storing and transferring an asset without a centralized authority, and each transaction is recorded and verifiable by everyone in a distributed way is, in itself, value.
The next question is then "with that system, how do you determine who has these assets to begin with?". And that's where mining comes in, which is a way of making it so that one person doesn't just start with all these assets, and having tangible work put into each bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:35:03
You can move it over quickly with a high transaction fee, but eth is much faster and much cheaper.

He's completely wrong, but what you said has nothing to do with why.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:42:42
It will probably drop significantly below where it is now. You will feel regret, you will think "why didn't I just wait". Remember that you made the right choice. The risk of the price going up thousands while you wait for it to dip instead of just buying now would not be worth it, even after you know the price dropped afterwards. Don't watch the price obsessively. Don't sell, don't dwell on the extra 20% you could have made when it dips to 10k before hitting 20k+. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:37:23
What was the miner fee?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:17:52
You could see how many different wallets own bitcoin, but there's no way to know which addresses belong to the same person.
And no, bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Right now, it's divisible to 8 decimal places, but this can change.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:39:01
The fee is not for creating the transaction. The fee is to incentivise miners to include your transaction in their block. You're looking at weeks to never for a zero fee transaction to be included. And right now, transactions are being made faster than they're being sent, so the fees are even higher than usual.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:33:07
You'd be paying tax on $5 in gains.

You can have it quickly, or have it with no fees, but not both. Wire transfer = 1 day or less depending on when you initiate it, but costs about $35.

Transfer to GDAX, put a sell limit order a few cents above the current price, pay no fee when it hits that price. Coinbase to GDAX transfers are instant.

The fact that they ask for your SSN should make him LESS suspicious. They need it for the same reason a bank does. They operate within the US, and keep records for tax purposes.

Has nothing to do with transaction fees. High transaction fees are why it's not really a good idea to try and transfer bitcoins out right now. Depending on how much you own, the transaction fee might be inconsequential enough to do it anyway, but if you wait a bit, transaction should be much less congested, and thus cheaper/faster. It's not a good idea to store coins long-term in coinbase/GDAX or any online wallet because you don't have complete control over them and if something happens, however unlikely, like GDAX getting hacked, you'd lose your bitcoins. Your USD is insured on Coinbase/GDAX, but not your bitcoins.
Granted, Coinbase probably has better security than the average person's home computer, so either transfer to a paper or hardware wallet, especially if you have a significant amount.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:33:58
It can take 7+ business days for an ACH transfer to coinbase.
If you're trying to transfer enough to make it economically viable, a wire transfer clears in hours if it's before 1PM, or the next business day if after 1PM. But it will cost around $35 for each transfer. Then, buy on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:49:27
I'd use a hardware wallet. Personally, I use a Ledger Nano S. The main con is that it costs money. If you're holding, say, $100 worth of BTC in it, the wallet costs just as much as what you're storing on it. But it supports a multitude of altcoins and is significantly more secure than an wallet and a bit more secure than a local software-based wallet. Paper is cheap and secure for storage, but is only secure for sending as whatever you use to send.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:51:53
When you find a little something that can be added to the list of transactions on the block to have a hash that starts with a certain number of zeroes. When you hear about the difficulty increasing, it means the number of leading zeroes required goes up.
Also, it's a lot more than 1 coin right now. Currently it's 12.5
