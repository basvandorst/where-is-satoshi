"if you're not with us, you're against us" mentality. Very mature.
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:59:20
What about the idea that this will most likely gravitate towards large banks and financial institutions controlling mega hubs to make it work in any meaningful way? Is that true? I think this would be the biggest fear
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:13:42
It doesn't have the pedigree of going since 2009 and satoshi as the creator + the satoshi vision of scaling via bigger blocks. Also LTC already changed over to segwit (with all of the downsides that go along with that). It also doesn't have all of the support of bitcoin early adopters who are bitcoin (BCH) supporters for life. Segwit makes sense if you intend to have full blocks and are shooting for the elusive holy grail of Level 3 LN. If not, it makes little sense. The current Level 2 LN can be done better on BCH right now today than on BTC. Level 3 does need Segwit with full blocks but I think it is impossible to achieve on 1mb blocks, if it is even possible at all.
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:57:17
Yeah but with btrash increasing block size, you've gotta slam them for that though right!? You have to make an exception there... I mean they can try increasing blocks to 32, 128 256mb then 1GB and onwards but we already know it won't work so we have to tell everyone that it is impossible because otherwise newbies might get the wrong idea... right? But that's beside the point. I'm asking you to strengthen the arsenal of arguments as to why LN IS possible and where the video is wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:26:04
I don't know what you're on about. I'm all about what is true and correct. Let's just focus on the facts. Have you got any answer at all as to why this video is incorrect? I think we need to have a good answer when the tough questions start being asked.
@_date: 2018-05-11 23:25:02
But with the blockchain proper there is no such need for everyone to run full nodes and leave a lot of liquidity tied up in channels because the mining incentives are such that you don't really care who the miners are. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:36:17
Oh okay... so your argument is something like: "trust the authority figures within BTC" - an appeal to authority "argument" so to speak... yeah I don't think that is an actual argument.
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:29:49
okay awesome. That's a start. And I've seen it mentioned about "watchtowers" is that a response to the fact that your channel needs to be online at all times or something like that? so you outsource this to a 3rd party? (to keep your channel open for you when you turn off your browser or put your phone into airplane mode or whatever)
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:47:42
This will give you an idea of how far off it is. Won't be long. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:55:28
ohk. That's okay. You just choose the right entity to trust with your money. Similar to the financial system we have now. Seems to work okay.
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:07:20
When you say the fact that many people can and do run full nodes protects... I think you actually may mean that there would be a wider potential pool of people who *may* setup lightning channels with friends / stores etc. Rather than doing what most people will do which would be to connect up one time to a big bank / mega node?
What I'm getting at is you need both (1) little ppl running full nodes and (2) these same ppl setting up LN channels with other little ppl rather than just the big nodes (which would be the main incentive)
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:27:11
We need a robust arguemnt as to why lightning network can overcome this apparent issue. What are our rebuttals guys? What are the best arguments in response to this?
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:00:03
But what people don't understand is explained in this video:  So you see. at r/bitcoin, we have to ensure that newbies are not influenced by such material. This is what we're up against!
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:47:54
interesting. Can you tell me more about this "routing around them" and how that works? If it is "trivially easy" that sounds good.
I am assuming that - if this large entity or few mainstream entities tried to censor your transaction (politically opposed to you for example - and what happens already today), that the LN would automatically seek out alternative routes right through the smaller, more convoluted channels?? Is that basically what you're referring to? But these alternative routes would only be able to handle so much volume before all of the "beads on the abacus" ended up at one end and no more transactions could flow... so I guess there would be somewhat of a power differential between who can censor who more...
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:17:19
nah I just want to get ahead of the curve and let newbies understand why this video has got it all wrong. I'm sure some of you here will have better technical knowledge than myself to clear this attack on BTC up! I'm sure it will just be part of the usual conspiracy to take down BTC right!? I thought this r/bitcoin forum was like the training ground for developing strong arguments for why lightning is robust.
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:15:06
I guess with most of the mining power in favour of bcash, BTC will have to change its algorithm at some point too aye? Because otherwise all of the new mined BTC will just keep getting sold to buy bcash... that must be a concern for you too with this conspiracy to destroy sound money... this is worse than I thought :(
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:41:09
Bold. So you'll go down with the ship if LN doesn't work... what will you do? You're that confident the totally new untested system will work?
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:01:58
We will soon be seeing that in action. Going to be interesting. I'd like to see the LN similarly used with any kind of volume
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:07:35
that sounds like quite the conspiracy. And soooo many people have all been independently fooled into buying it... how do you know this? So you think that the original bitcoin was not sound money either? What are you saying here? Because the bcash protocol is basically the original bitcoin with one exception (a block limit increase).
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:40:01
Those bcash ratbags copied this "day in the life of carol" idea too!!! 
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:43:24
This is getting confusing... I'm asking for people to tell me why this video is wrong (you know, people who *do* understand and can explain and you're saying that unless people fully understand lightning network without watching a video to assist they should not even use BTC? So what is this forum for... just trash talking? Do you understand lightning network enough to explain to me (in very technical terms) why it is wrong? Or do you not understand but you are still pro-BTC anyway?
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:46:53
what about bitcoin cash? - I will never ever support BTC. Only BCH - scaling as originally intended by satoshi and his right hand man and successor Gavin Andresen - who was backstabbed and kicked off the repository by blockstream (the people he invited initially). Blockstream - the development team that has received $70 million in "investments" from banks to railroad BTC off into a science experiment of "lightning" network settlement coin... that doesn't even work - and will never work --&gt; ah but it might if there are just a few massive banking nodes that can control and track every transaction. (i.e. a recreation of our current predicament but worse). And if one of those nodes goes down... catastrophe. Mass hysteria. Because 1mb blocks cannot handle that many people trying to settle on-chain. Would take 150 years just to set up everyone in the world with the required 10 channels at 1mb blocks! And that is without anyone actually using the network for anything else or creating any further changes to payment channels...It is a joke! 256mb blocks is like a conservative starting point. 1GB will follow close behind. 10 GB in 5 years or so aught to be plenty. Maybe even longer. 1 terabyte can serve 10 billion people at 50 transactions per day... far in excess of average current use of e-commerce. There would be soooo much capital sloshing around the bitcoin community at each stage, whatever hardware costs are required would be a non-issue.
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:14:34
You said that if you're not constantly shouting someone's ideas down then you're "indirectly confirming them"... then you basically say: "why would you do such a thing as to conform to that person!?". By the way... Roger Ver is legit. One of the most trustworthy guys in all of crypto space. It is only scumbags like you who try to discredit him that perpetuate the hate for him. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:51:53
This is so hilarious. The revolution always eats itself... good on ya's for trying though. You could have just increased block size and used instant 0 conf... but that is already being done and you'd lose face now if you went that route... better hope your segwit settlement coin science experiment works out now... tick tock..
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:20:30


But all of the other hard-forks like bitcoin gold and private were off of the segwit version (BTC). 
BCH has not had any subsequent hardforks / splits since the original one to avoid the segwit protocol change that they didn't like.
So with that in mind... are you saying that actually the original bitcoin was not sound money all along? and therefore bcash is like part of their plan to continue that same thing going? Maybe satoshi himself is in on the conspiracy and then the lightning network comes along to create "sound money" and they're like "oh crap" blockstream are here to create sound money... nooo we can't have that... so they fork and keep the original bitcoin whitepaper going under a new name of bcash... very sneaky.
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:27:29
Yeah but they're just mining what is most profitable. Doesn't mean they want to own btc over bch. They have sha256 asics so they'll mine whichever and sell their least preferred... it's a problem for btc because miners like bch
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:06:50
Biased in terms of information and truth. I don't mind whether people like btc or bch just as long as it is for valid reasons rather than lies and slander. I admit a lot of r/btc is defending against lies and other half is about all the new projects coming to life
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:03:18
Yeah guys - there's no way that this could happen to you if you just put your money in the bank!
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:21:53
Interesting point. This makes me think that if we voluntarily give up our privacy (link wallet to ID) on bitcoin that we may be able to seek private insurance in the same way. But the issue is that the thieves would still be anonymous and you'd be accused of milking the system
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:53:00
Last time BTC fees went &gt;$55USD changelly took days for my friends funds to clear when he changed them for BCH.
- How can you run a decentralised exchange on top of BTC when it cannot handle spikes in volume?
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:03:41
Even better for BCH when blocks are 1GB in huge data centres. Pools will be broken up to vote / select properties of block creation. Very exciting
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:05:58
I don't think you guys realised that my original comment was a joke! I was implying that if people want to hold you to gun point and extort money from you - there is no alternative out there that is any better anyway. Having your money in a bank doesn't protect you from that.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:15:55
First you have to deposit collateral of more than you ever plan to send in one go... so never? Unless everyone connects to a few massive massive centralised LN nodes (banks)... that way you'll likely already be connected. :) but if one of those nodes goes off line accidentally (as even the biggest blizzard servers do!) It could flood the mempool for weeks while all those txns settle on-chain. LN is not perfect. It might be useful for some things though. The most likely senario... is that it completely breaks btc in a compete mempool flood and noone can get their money out while they watch the price plummet. It's a fun little mouse trap :) Will be fascinating to watch an inverted pyramid approach to scaling (where the fundamental layer is nerfed while the top layers get more and more heavy)
@_date: 2019-02-17 02:02:39
Nice. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-02-17 02:21:58
If miners can "collude" to do that... what's to stop the big guys from "colluding" with all of their hash power to raise block size and making it harder for the little guys to keep up with their economies of scale?
@_date: 2019-02-17 02:23:41
Won't the bigger dudes just undercut the little guys to get more market share?
@_date: 2019-02-17 03:04:32
Pretty sure Peter Todd thinks that it's a good idea too on technical grounds but doesn't think it would get enough community support to get through.
@_date: 2019-02-17 01:50:02
Hmm seems like the top devs are thinking about it though. They think it will help with miner revenue and decentralization that is actually a bit of a problem still. 300kb seems like a pretty good happy medium to settle on to balance these competing issues. There's too much spam and we have LN now... that's what ppl should be using. 
@_date: 2019-02-17 02:46:01
Not just luke-jr 
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:06:49
Only mining nodes can create consensus blocks. Partial non-mining nodes can only check to see if the output from those miners, who's rule set they agree with, is valid.
If non-mining nodes all disappear, bitcoin goes on. If all the mining nodes disappear, bitcoin is no more.
So this fear you have of "hostile entities or state actors" stealing and repurposing miners / mining pools would devastate btc just the same. 1mb blocks doesn't solve the problem - it exacerbates it because it keeps the user base small. If mothers are buying their baby formula with bitcoin, now you have an army of people who will fight to maintain economic freedom. Currently we're a bunch of nerds who barely even use the tech. (I use bch a lot but a lot of ppl in crypto are just hodlers).
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:17:33
I would argue that this has basically no bearing on growth of adoption if it comes at the cost of a 1mb block limit that causes on-chain fees to be &gt;$US 50 when volumes pick up - utterly un-useable at a "mom and pop store". What is the greater influence on adoption here? The mom and pop store or cafe can use a light client without any issue. But the $50 fees for a $5 coffee is a total deal breaker. 
In your ideological mind it is really really important for everyone to be able to run a full node. But users of this monetary system simply do not care. Never will. Nor should they. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:34:15


 The miners have a large amount of illiquid skin in the game whilst the users of the cryptocurrency have highly liquid skin in the game. The miners have an even stronger incentive to deliver a product that is of high value than the holders of crypto and certainly the shopkeepers (who may not even own any yet and if they did would jump to the former category of "liquid holder"). The customers vote with their feet. The miners decide the hardforks/ upgrades and must choose wisely because they're in deep (those asics can turn into expensive toasters very quickly).
I don't buy that widespread charity of running full nodes is necessary for censorship resistance. This undermines the entire philosophy of bitcoin - it aligns the incentives just fine the way it is - no charity / community service needed. 
Additionally - the whole idea of capitalism is that you don't have to own a $multi million supermarket franchise to gain exposure to the profit / loss of their business model... i.e. as this space matures, you can support the mining business model of your choosing with small funds. But the guys actually physically doing the business will always be the big players. That's how the world works
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:45:13
It sounds to me like you have to choose though between the competing compromises for customer utility. Zero conf is just fine on bch for small and medium merchants and even large ones as long as they're not selling houses or ferraris. And then it is just a matter of waiting 10 - 20 mins for confirmation which is fine for large transactions anyway and should be standard practice in all cases. 
Is it really worth stifling the growth of this thing in a monumental way to hold onto ideals about everyone being able to run a full node (at a loss)? The blockchain is already pretty large anyway and most just want a quick and easy light client for easy adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:25:58
My point exactly. So what is the issue? 
And don't tell me it will centralise mining. I just addressed that... combine harvesters didn't centralise food production (food production is a very large market so there are lots of farmers with expensive combine harvesters out there). And don't tell me that we need people to do charity work and run full nodes...
I want to know the actual issue if there is one.
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:48:59
But wouldn't gigabyte blocks be fine because only miners and maybe very large merchants would want to maintain a full node. 3 - 10TB hdds are pretty cheap especially if this is part of being in the business. Miners don't mine if not profitable so required fee would factor this in just like any market. Costs go up. Fees go up. But overall, fees would be very very low with such high capacity (if people were using it - BCH would be worth so much money too... so block reward would be insane anyway).
Would there be issues with block propagation with 1GB blocks? (i.e. would miners still be able to commence mining on the latest block using the header / filters and transmit the rest of the txn info over a longer time frame?). Would 1GB blocks pose any technical issues from this perspective. I am not worried about mining being expensive. Combine harvesters are expensive. Gold mining equipment and oils rigs (now THOSE are expensive barriers to entry). A 10TB harddrive every so often is not expensive to me - particularly if you raise capital from the masses as part of a $ for shares of mining farm system.
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:32:16
I did read it. You haven't addressed this. We're never going to agree. Hardforks are a part of life. A group of mates deciding what to get for dinner. You have other preferences but is it worth ditching your friends to go and eat something else? Probably not. Maybe if you feel very strongly (you're a vegan) and there's nothing you're willing to eat and there are a lot of other issues you've got with these guys... maybe it's a deal breaker and you go your own way. But most times you compromise. You leave the nukes of leaving for fundamental disagreements. 
Hardforks is capitalism / diversity / innovation / freedom to go your own way or compromise. 
Softforks are more like democracy / majority rules / authoritarian - resembling the state
BCH and BTC are fundamentally different. It is like free markets vs communism. 
BCHers think that free markets are decentralised enough even though inequalities arise - the growth of the market offsets this with more widespread adoption - not one person controls farming just because combine harvesters are really expensive. 
BTCers are obsessed with stomping out every last bit of decentralisation. They're possessed with ideology and forget about balancing this with user experience. 
The average moms and dads out there don't care about running full nodes. It just has to work. It just has to be decentralised enough. 
Time will tell. Central planning and 1mb blocks or organic growth and good customer service.
I appreciate your concerns about block propagation and in my view this would result in a *geographical* concentration of miners (due to latency and advantages with receiving blocks quicker) - similar to how silicon valley has a concentration of tech companies - not necessarily a problem - there will be concentrated pockets in regions with cheap power and cool weather. 
As it stands BCH is the sensible way forward - other solutions may arise. If LN is useful it will work 100x better on BCH anyway (setting up channels etc). You push the envelope first and fix it up when problems arise. You don't keep going to the drawing board while all the customers pack up and leave.
