if you bought them from an exchange they may still be on there if you never transferred the coins to your own wallet.   If you did transfer them to your wallet.dat file then they only way is if you manually backed up the wallet.dat file, or you have the original.. best of luck to you, if u cant find them oh well you only lost 57 dollars

Ive been following bitcoin for a long time, I've had probably around 40 in total the problem is, I'm a broke single dad that struggles day to day so when a bill comes in i have to pay..its into the bit coin stash now i have .6 of a bit coin left... until the next bill....then i may have to start on the street corner :D

people trying to fuck with the market. looks like the market can't be fucked with atm
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:57:33
theres a month plus waiting list to withdraw us $ to your bank atm, heard people saying that if they offer them 5% they will jump u to the front of the backlog...what a joke

Know one knows!  could be the start of a bubble could be then tip of the bubble, may not be a bubble at all. there is some favourable U.S Announcement tomorrow so if you can afford it id say give it a shot. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:51:43
kind of pointless really, i wouldn't worry about it op as long as it wasn't your power. and you don't have a trojan that mines when you take your computer home.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:32:24
dont do it, how would u feel if it crashed to sub 100 level? which is entirely possible. just invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:55:39
how would one go about cashing out 21000 bit coins. id be happy to retire when my btc are worth 1 million
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:50:10
glad my reddit isn't fucked up :D
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:49:25
lol think of it as a long term investment and youll be fine.. youll end up slitting your wrist day trading bit coins. this recent us senate meeting is great news for bitcoins and 900 per coin will one day seem like nothing
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:29:56
good job man i particularly like who it wraps up with "bit coin is the first time in history people have had total control of their own money"  I think that this is the main selling point of bitcoin the the masses 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:09:15
OH damn i better go rethink math and science. im off to the casino with my life savings thanks coinflipbot

@_date: 2013-11-23 00:22:59
wow thats cool,  if only it was a universal thing on the internet to be able to give quick tips to good posts and articles. I think it would make the "quality" of things people share much better.  Lol... just thinking how good  it would be good if you could some how take money of the poster for some dribble, mean,bullying, racist ect.. posts/information that overtake the internet today. wouldn't that make the internet a more friendly and useful place :D
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:51:01
POP....SELL SELL SELL.......
buying back in at 50c per coin not missing the boat second time around

@_date: 2013-11-28 08:41:07
also there support suck lately for some reason, they used to have live support but it hasn't been online in at least 2 weeks and 5 day response times for written emails.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:38:41
cool, Interesting.  I'm sure they'll be a gif for 1000 on bitstamp and the milestone posts wont be every 100 now probably every 1k, heres looking forward to the 10,000k gif.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:13:39

I just scrolled down to this and didn't read the rest. sorry op if whatever sob story was true. if not i like the fact that you put a lot of effort into your story.

Obv troll.

@_date: 2013-11-20 13:24:56
lol i wasn't referring to you just thinking aloud how you could make some money after reading your post, as u said it was just a post not an article. anyway i do hope this is true would be great for bit coin. peace mate gl with your job and what not
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:45:05
and if it falls to 0 tomorrow how will you feel?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:29:17
it was good we also used to cut people open with scalpels to try and fix them like barbarians, drive our own cars, all have to work 9-5 jobs let a group of assholes make decisions about the future of our planet with only a choice of a few ass hats to choose from. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:05:15
Yeah if you flip a coin 10 times, and it comes up tails everyone of those flips, a lot of gamblers work on the premise that "oh wow ive got to bet on heads'
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:08:36
heres hoping:D
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:04:04
ya i got 560 mBTC sounds a lot better than half coin
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:56:04
lol not an idiot, just speculation based on past events which are no guarantee of future results, i just find it very hard to believe the value isn't propped up significantly by speculation right now, i don't think the current infrastructure warrants its price point.  Of course i want bitcoin to succeed and still hold more than i sold was just hoping for the "bubble" to pop to pick up some cheap coins. Simply saying i may have made a mistake...or not who knows.  but thanks for your valuable input good sir.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:45:22
+1 waiting in lines sucks. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:21:20
this is true as long as its not a SSD, however if you have been using the computer on a regular basis id assume that pointers have been replaced by new programs and random data. 
Also id figure out how to do the data recovery by yourself, i would trust an it professional with 10k worth of easily steal-able data .."Nope sorry, couldn't recover the files"
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:12:05
cool 9000 million per bitcoin sounds like a fair price. think i might disappear for 10 years so i don't get tempted to spend my coins then come back and buy a few countries.

hahah if anyone knew for sure, or even slightly had any idea they wouldn't stop by to answer a stranger. gl with gambling make an investment strategy and stick with it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:42:09
I loled, nice job op thanks for your effort if i had enough btc id share them with u :D
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:22:01
ya i still cant believe how little people have actual control of their money, my parents just paid something ridiculous to wire a few thousand dollars over seas via WU..i bet you they are the biggest company that has something to lose buy bitcoin, maybe they should jump on board and be an exchange or something otherwise there gunna go under.
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:59:23
i think a up voted price announcement should be allowed every hundy till 1k is acceptable.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:54:18
just invest 10 bucks into every new one that comes out just incase bitcoin turns out to be the betamax of vc
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:25:31
wish i had a life so i could stop watching ...im trying to will it with my mind to hit 1k so it can crash and i can get some coins

dont get tempted to cash in were on our way to mars
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:52:45
id say at this point in time have a stash ready to buy every time it drops 100 bucks maybe even 50.. with the recent senate news the crash isn't going to happen today
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:46:48
yay cheaper coins.. with all this senate hearing and media coverage and google trends i dont think this is the real crash just yet.. people will still be scrambling to buy bitcoins imo
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:17:02
lo its sad and true. you guys really live in the most fucked up country in the world we all follow ur dumb trends, if your economy collapses under the weight of its own debt we are all going to suffer, if you fall we all fall too.. tell ur government to pick up there shit
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:43:31
cool man, I'd like to see Banksy give some love to stuff like this taking the art to the streets.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:34:29
thank u kind internet fellow. I shall wait 20 years and then buy a car with that :D
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:09:00
So eventually market share/cap will be the only factor determining price at this point as speculation will be out of the picture ?
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:06:51
so crazy why cant god give me a break ;(
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:02:23
lol,  I wouldn't by a shit country, obviously id buy Australia !
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:56:05
saw this coming sold at 610 bought back in at 540ish made a bit coin..fistpump
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:38:34
yeah its currently no check it out :D
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:50:10
i guess if you wanted to make ashit ton of money you could .
1.buy a shit ton of bit coins
2.spread fake articles about ebay/starbucks accepting btc
3.sell said bit coins
4. profit??
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:59:04
Hmm not sure there was this thing a few months ago where you could order them go into a local bank hand over cash at a teller and boom u had bitcoins ill look it up when i get home. was totally anonymous too.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:38:15
sure im cashing out 5 years from today. then retiring, speculation is for the weak.
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:22:18
Mtgox for me is very bad, there live support is always offline for me, they take days to get back to me, withdrawals took months, they offered me to do it quicker for 5% (WHAT KIND OF SCAM  IS THIS) i did it.lol and it still took 2 weeks, cant move less than 1 btc off mtgox, im sure theres more reasons no one should use mtgox.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:12:32
i think the problem is the top post are of people that don't really understand how a pos bitcoin transaction works. ie you can instantly tranfer the coins to us dollars at the point of sale
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:37:25
I'd say this has a lot to do with it.
its like been given the tick of approval by the us gov.

Please Stop posting these stop posting threads.

crash ? maybe not 
correction ..constantly.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:54:47
lol go outside, come back and check on btc in a few years.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:37:42
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:28:18
given the long term growth of bitcoin, even after crashes and unfavourable news, any crash is going to be met with hoards of people trying to nab up cheap coins. ill be one of them. its like the ability to go back in time and purchase when you should have :D
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:04:05
if this sham of a financial system the word currently uses gets totally replaced by bit coin, then fractions of bit-coins could make you very wealthy individuals.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:52:39
i thought it was too late when it hit 80 bucks per coin ..then def too late when it hit 266 per coin ..i think ill still be buying coin at 10k a pop
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:17:21
lol, implying its more stable after one small correction and bounce is crazy.  did you not se the drop to 500 a week a go? but the market has maured and grown since then .....lol
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:57:16
No one knows mate. don't let any one convince you otherwise.
don't invest more than you can afford to lose, if your just buying as an investment then its a pure gamble but if you want to be apart of something great and enjoy a roller coaster ride then go for it and enjoy the ride. Don't beat yourself up though if tomorrow bit-coin is worth zip.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:53:09
might be time to get a job at a recycling plant and looking at every hardrive that comes through if u get lucky you can retire. iwonder how many people bought bit coins in 2009 upgraded there computer and threw away old hard drives
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:55:52
or nothing at all
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:04:20
Hmm im not sure it would have the positive increase we are hoping for if  the market is correcting from these recent price hikes. no noobies are going to want to enter the market on the way down.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:50:57
buy now if ur rich tomorrow send be some wealth if ur poor ill send u some k?
