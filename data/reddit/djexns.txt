Haaa, I can't believe it, another one like me. :)  
I also have an old Raspberry PI 2, locked and loaded, just waiting for my 1TB mSata SSD to arrive. :)

Well, I bought an SSD enclosure for the drive, so I just stick it in (sorry for the pun :) ), and connect it to PI via USB.
It should theoretically work, but I haven't tried it yet, since I'm still waiting on my parts to arrive.
But you have to first do a full sync on that SSD while connected to another machine, since on PI it would take ages... Then you just reconnect it to PI and voala..

Wasabee is alright, the starting script is named that way...
But you should always verify the gpg signature when downloading 
@_date: 2019-03-01 12:31:39
Awesome! I was just about to write that you should verify their signature with their public key (which of course, you needed to download and import first :D )  
But I see you figured it out. :)

But the power is not concentrated in mining farms... Hash power yes, but full nodes decide what code to run, which in itself is voting power. Each full node validates transactions and blocks, not just the miners. [

Just no. That's stupid.

I know about this one, but it's still in the early stages:
 
It says it's not consuming battery power that quickly :3

Haha yeah, and in the movies where Tom Hanks finds the bad guys

Dude... basically all energy that bitcoin uses is green energy... Like hydro, solar or wind... Because it's the cheapest!  
You should read a bit about it.

Exactly my thoughts, complete and mass decentralization... Billions of nodes, and you carry it with you.  
Plus, as time goes by, phones will grow much more powerful, maybe even turn into powerful wearables, with cool UI... You won't even have to know the backend intricacies of running a full node.

Sure, that's pretty sweet.   
But I meant unpruned, with a capacity for growth... That would be even more awesome imho

In theory (and this is just my opinion) - yes, it is possible.Anything is possible and hackable.But mind you, the attacker will only be able to insert or remove transactions, but not alter them or steal existing bitcoin.
I find it hard to see how that could be achieved without a complete coordinated action in those malicious actor states. (I can only see Russia, China or USA in those roles)  
They would need massive... And I really mean colossal electrical power consumption (so electric plants would need to redirect from usual consumers, theoretically), and a lot of hash power (which is not easily gainable overnight). They'd need to buy or produce ASIC's for this, over a period of time.
Bitcoin hash power is around 45 exahashes per second now, which is already insane imo.. And the hashrate grows with the price, as we all know. Imagine the hashrate in 5-10 years, when bitcoin is valued at 100k. It would grow exponentially...And let's say bitcoin hits 1mil... Hashrate would be a truly mammoth number, I fail to even imagine it.
If we do have some malicious state that wants to attack the network, it would have to be with previously unseen numbers, large large expenditure, and all that for only several double spends...And I'm not knowledgeable enough to conclude if they can be kicked off the network at that point, but I'm assuming something would be thought of when that happens.
Until we encounter such a threat, I'm considering the network pretty safe. :)

It should be valid, but don't take my work
D for it...
I've heard and seen that they've been contacting some people with remaining balances in order to reimburse them.
Nobuaki Kobayashi is indeed the trustee, and probably partially responsible for a part of the crash in 2018, since he dumped a large quantity of BTC and BCH on one of the exchanges (instead of selling them OTC) in order to repay the people that lost coins in the hack.
Idiot guy, but hey he's in charge of that.
They still have somewhere around 200k BTC to sell.
If they dump again on the exchanges, that should lower the price nicely, so we can collect those sweet sweet coins. :3

Coinbase doesn't send it immediately, even if the confirmations passed.
They send it in batches, at arbitrary times... Lower fees.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:34:05
I can make it.
Not a bad idea my man. Not bad at all.
