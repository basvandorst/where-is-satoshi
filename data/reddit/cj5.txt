If you think providing an email and bank account information is a measure of anonymity, then your dumb ass deserves to be monitored.

Well by stagger, I meant that there's an attempt to stave off BTC, thus making BTC even less of a market presence. I figured that there are a lot of potential users of bitcoin on ebay, shops and sellers that could accept payment via bitcoin instead of dollars. Would this split hamper that at all?
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:58:17
Okay, that clarifies it best. Well it's too bad bitcoin was not an influence. Maybe someday ;)

Does it really fuckin matter? Trading is not illegal. Besides can someone, puhleeeeez add a link to Ken Hess' article?

This is just more establishment propagandizing bullshit. When you're constantly comparing everything to the US dollar it's a bit hard these days to get a favorable value, when things are manipulated to no end. Bitcoin is best on its own. People are still using it, and it doesn't need to be measured against a fiat currency, that without being rigged, would be worthless.

I don't know. They could I suppose, if you want to play the speculation game, but I can't prove that **every** company does this. Isn't the use of the currency evidence that there is appreciation? You're implying that everyone runs back to fiat as soon as they make BTC. You have more of burden of proof than I do, and in most cases, who would in their right mind would sell off in a low period? The mere fact that businesses are using bitcoin is value in itself. Why would they bother with bitcoin if they could just as easily take on less risk by depending on a fiat?

If they don't bounce and have a lot of zeroes after a number, yes.
P.S. Who the fuck uses checks anymore?
P.S.S. USD is a check (ok a note, a check by another name).

I think this goes for a lot in our current society. So many broken people serving a broken system.

People use it now without exchanging it. Again, you're tying it down, based on USD. That is why people have this misguided perspective of crypto-currency.

Good. I have no sympathy for the global banking cartel. The time when they lose their steel grip control over currency couldn't come soon enough.

The banking industry is not only powerful, but they abuse such power. No one can legitimately say that they feel that the policies and practices of banks offer secure safety nets for economies (in any sense), allow all participants within economic markets to play by the same rules, and therefore provide effective mobility for the economy. If governments are going to manage currencies and hold only banks to being the gatekeepers of it, then there exists an obligation on the banks' part to ensure stability, mobility, and security. These things are being overlooked, and abused.

Yeah but the real question is, why do I keep running out of money?
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:14:37
It's like the Europeans that came to the Americas and stole from Native Americans. Now it's done with financial mechanisms, instead of gun powder and fur pelts.

1-2 hours is a shit ton better than having to wait 3-5 business days for the money to clear into your bank account from PayPal.
