So just to be clear, you want me to quote the satoshi white paper for you because you obviously haven't taken the time to do it yourself? Doing your homework now BRB
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:00:30
Even more sad is the way you core shills shameless shill for 3rd party solutions to problems when the solutions to said problems are in the original white paper

The only way to stick to the white paper was to hardfork away from the people trying to change what made BTC great in the first place. Shill smarter

So I see you've all embraced the authoritarian mindset. How precious. Keep pretending like the "good guys" are the ones who censor opinions.

The entire point of bitcoin cash was to fork away from the group who co-opted the coin to implement 3rd party solutions to on-chain issues. Appealing to original vision of bitcoin is now a bad thing? The only way that is possible is through core shill brainwashing people into thinking the group following the original white paper are the ones who are trying to scam everyone. When in reality, the ones who are being deceitful and scammy are the ones who censored people they disagreed with. Tell me where lightning network, schnorr and all of the other outside bullshit fits into the original white paper? It doesn't, but all of you core shills purposely deceive people by claiming that BTC is still bitcoin when it's not. It's the furthest thing from what made BTC what it is today. Nothing that these new young BTC devs are doing have ANYTHING to do with the Satoshi white paper. The ONLY thing BTC still has in common with what it started as is the name and abbreviation.
