The ledger has not been perfectly operational uninterrupted for the past 10 years. There have been issues. One time someone generated billions of bitcoins in a transaction and another time faulty software caused a hard fork. There was the time GHash got more than 51% meaning all assumptions of the blockchain became invalid. Bitcoin is not invincible. It has amazing uptime considering it's been running almost perfectly for 10 years but it's not perfect.

you'll definitely need to "lay back once it's up and"

I kinda agree with abobe it's a serious question man. I personally believe JavaScript will be better because it's portable and the next few years are going to see very big changes to JS and WASM which will help get it in front of people. 
Python would be more for providing a service and using the blockchain to execute the service

Can't a quantum computer do what current miners do and just guess &amp; check exponentially quickly? If the checking is fast enough it's possible they could eventually guess a valid block right?

You can set your own peer seed if you want. There are presets because they help keep setup fast and computers can't just find peers when they don't know where to start.

Is the drive an external hard drive, or part of a laptop or desktop? If it's part of your computer I wouldn't consider installing Linux because that could very well wipe the drive in the process. 
What operating system is your machine running? Linux, Ubuntu, and MacOS all have grep out of the box. If you have a Windows machine, it looks like there's a findstr command that behaves similar to grep but I'm not familiar with Windows commands.

Grep supports regex which can be used to flag all sequences of characters on your drive that match a possible Bitcoin address. Here is an example regex I found for Bech32 addresses:
 (your regex will depend on essentially which version of Bitcoin was the main net running when you generated the address/key pair. The current schema is p2pkh)
Grep for that to find the matches. Then you can parse out the files with a match, pipe the file names into xargs, and grep each possible file for a sequence of characters that matches a private key. 
Because of math, it's actually pretty unlikely there will be many matches besides the address/key. If there are more than one pair found, either try them all or sign &amp; decrypt with each pair until you find a valid match.

Timestamps are mostly just metadata for a block, but aren't used in any chain validation. Computers around the world don't have synchronized clocks, so using a timestamp is not an effective way to compare times across a network. The block height is a definitive measure of "this came before this" or "this came after this" but exact times are not used on the chain due to synchronization difficulties

Probably 1.2 bil in BTC price in 2023. So if the price reaches 280k then that would be ~4k BTC. At today's price that's ~25 mil which is still equally insane.

Human brains are not organized in the same way. We know so little about how the brain works. Just because things are connected (the internet and cells in a brain) doesn't mean they behave the same way.
I encourage you to try to code up a simple agent that uses forms of AI and you'll see just how difficult and limited it is to do even very simple tasks. People created Bitcoin

Transactions in different channels are asynchronous. That's what makes lightning possible. Obviously in a single channel there are parts which are synchronous like unlocking the balance.
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:48:52
Probably in a trivial, contrived use case where the nodes in the channel are connected by Ethernet but even then I find that near impossible just because of limitations of computing and networks.
I think what's more important than TPS per channel is total TPS because each transaction is asynchronous so opening more channels allows for more concurrent transactions to happen

You're telling others to read it when you haven't read it?

It's literally exactly how math works. Start with $10. After 1600% increase you have $160. After 11% drop you have $142.4 which is a $17.6 drop which is 175% of your initial capital.
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:49:14
True but going up 1600% then down 11% relative to that jump is a 175% drop (relative to start price). 
Not complaining though :) grateful for BTC and the community. Price is just a nice bonus :)
