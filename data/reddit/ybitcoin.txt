Hi! Thanks for the message, if you requested an issue within the past 3 months your order has been building in a queue and will be shipped as soon as the new issue rolls off the press. We structure our distribution like that to minimize shipping costs and maximize how many magazines we can print!

Almost the entire yBitcoin team will be there!

The articles will consist of 800 word guides on essential Bitcoin topics such as mining, exchanging (buying/selling bitcoins), legal, shopping, etc.. each written by an expert from the space. Relevant advertisements will flow around that content.. the guide is meant to introduce someone to Bitcoin and take them through the intellectual steps needed to buy their first coin.

The numbers would amaze you! However, this is designed to look like Architectural Design... We're literally using the highest quality print standards available.

Recurring. yBitcoin will never charge for our magazine as it is 100% advertiser supported. If you need extra magazines as well, to share with friends or family, you can request additional copies through our contact page!
Edit: Just to clarify, only those that request a copy will get a subscription- our direct-mail campaign will change address every quarter, meaning within our first year we should ship to at least 120,000 unique addresses.
