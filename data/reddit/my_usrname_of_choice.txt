Lots of places. 
But New Zealand.

Yet still not available here.

He's fine, it's the rest of us that need to worry.
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:42:45
I would have liquidated ages ago. He's got some balls.
@_date: 2017-03-30 23:19:19
Is there though? Moderation is a form of censorship.
Not saying it probably wasn't justified, but I think it's still humerous irony.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:06:08
I'm not sure what having a passport has to do with this.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:04:18
Could *have.*
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:24:28
Check the car model, mate.
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:18:01
You can actually. The blue steering wheel icon.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:46:30
Tesla makes no guarantee to its ability, you are required to supervise it and technically keep your hands on the wheel at all times.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:36:23
I'm really fucking sick of the circlejerk in this sub. I want facts and information, not any of this bullshit turfwars.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:26:27
Dollarydoos is the currency. It means AUD.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:02:14
You're welcome!
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:48:13
Who died?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:23:55
Not autonomous. Not yet. It's driving within its lane, but not autonomously.
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:12:45
Calling emotional for not liking metaphorical insults at rival chains is hilariously ironic.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:20:27
So that's a few million, many more hundreds to go.
Not everyone in those countries is investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:42:08
That is in no way a valid response to my concern. Circlejerks about a rival chain are not helpful to anyone.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:42:31
Au contraire.
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:22:37
Guys, I don't understand any of this shit. I've been lurking here for a year and I just don't get all these acronyms and what this "war" means. Who's doing what? What does it mean? What do we want?
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:10:18
Why are you being a dick?
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:21:27
Those fuckers still have my shit. They still have a Facebook page too.
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:13:38
So is it an entirely different wallet in itself? A standalone wallet? I use other wallets so if that's all it is then I'm not bothered.
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:33:10
Wow I'll give this a try, thanks. Can you tell me briefly what the difference between enabling the wallet function and not enabling it provides? I'm not sure how my wallet is supposed to interface with Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-04-16 00:50:42
I have no fucking idea. I thought it was someone's​ name.
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:12:09
Seems to be working. I didn't get any errors. Are there any commands I can give to check the status of the server?
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:34:10
9.10 (jails).
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:38:20
You don't run FreeNAS in a virtualised environment. It needs to run on 'bare metal'.
Now, you *can* virtualise it, but it's only for very advanced users.
Bitcoin node runs in a jail inside FreeNAS. FreeNAS is *kind of* acting like a hypervisor, but not really.
Understand that? I want to make sure you're not confused.
@_date: 2017-04-15 22:06:44
This. So much this. I have no idea what the fuck is happening.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:26:37
I'm not sure what you're asking. Virtualisation is a concept which isn't quite related. 
If you had a hypervisor server on 24/7 then yes, virtualising a guest operating system to run Bitcoin core would mean you don't need another machine turned on.
@_date: 2017-04-16 08:21:35
I'm not sure you know what "despite" means.
@_date: 2017-04-11 01:34:38
You mean virtualisation?
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:33:44
Means I don't need a second server on 24/7.
@_date: 2015-10-17 22:24:25
Probably the thousands of people waiting for them to support their country, like myself.
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:20:20
Dunno. Has to plateau sometime
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:15:00
Usually this is only true for people at the same bank. Inter-bank transfers take a day.
@_date: 2017-05-01 04:01:29
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:53:27
Someone asks question,
Someone answers question,


Uh, if you don't like it then ignore it.
@_date: 2015-10-20 07:53:48
Meh anyone that stupid probably shouldn't delve into the realm of currency investment.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:51:05
Wait, what?
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:07:21
Lol alrighty then:
In NZ intra-bank transfers are instant, intra-bank transfers take around a day.
@_date: 2015-10-14 10:05:10
I don't know if you can really compare Moore's law with Bitcoin. Bitcoin definitely has to plateau at some point. Constant inflation would be ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:28:38
Better than what?
@_date: 2015-10-26 07:08:25
I bought and sold some about a week ago for a few cents profit for a laugh. Kinda pissed at this surge
@_date: 2017-07-09 01:48:56
Well the first time you use an acronym you do. From then on you don't.
@_date: 2015-10-13 19:32:34
I wish I wasn't a sceptic 5 years ago 😞
@_date: 2015-10-20 07:33:54
Japanese yen is the opposite of bitcoin. They don't have part currency
@_date: 2015-10-20 07:50:07
I see what you mean. You're proposing the *base* unit become bit? As it currently stands yen and bitcoin are at the opposite end of the scale. 1 bitcoin ≈ ¥38,000.
It has always annoyed me that bitcoin is so high compared to local currency
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:25:30
No. Sarcasm is not a personal attack. 
Go away.
@_date: 2015-10-13 10:10:23
The squeaky wheel gets the oil though. Looks like they've just had poor customer service and bad banking set ups. Hopefully my transaction will go through and I can pull it back out
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:51:48
What's the point of holding "until the end"? Do you not want to use it?
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:18:52


OP is clearly doing a service by publicly outing this email.
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:52:32
Why did you think this contributed anything meaningful?
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:59:51
Then what?
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:17:17
Haha brb, making one.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:09:24
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:15:34
To be fair, I only decide to invest what I can afford to lose so I'm not so much *fucked*. The major complaints they have are with huge transactions. Kinda dumb no one here has anything good to say about them though.
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:24:13
Hopefully if I'm only now starting to invest in it
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:13:36
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:16:17
Can you buy your groceries and pay your bills in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:04:03
Not with Bitcoin they're not.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:09:47
Run*. "Ran" is past simple.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:12:02
It doesn't give any personal details.
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:29:24
I wish I'd mined Bitcoin back when they were cheap ��
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:17:06
I don't know what any of this means.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:15:15
Controversial advice. Don't people say to not do this?
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:48:54
Seems like that kind of defeats the whole philosophy of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-29 09:18:26
Right, I see. I misunderstood.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:14:05
Igot are fuckers. I only lost $50 to them but I never received my coin. Just completely ignored all of my correspondence.
I haven't bothered to transfer my shit to the tokens, I'm just ignoring them, but I'd hate to be in your situation. Keep trying.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:05:08
Seriously how do you mess this up?
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:48:39
If one were to hypothetically create some ransomware in this fashion, would it be easy enough to have every infected machine show a differently generated address?
