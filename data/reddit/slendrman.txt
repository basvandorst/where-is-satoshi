I don't know, it's not really the worst idea.  We are born into homes and so we feel like that's all there is, and anyone who doesn't rent or own is automatically strange or different.
But you aren't tied down to rent/mortgage/heating/lease term, if you lose your job you don't have to panic as much. 
As of late I have been feeling so fucking constrained as I make more money.

I figured that, that's why I'm asking.
So if I were to put $10,000 on cavirtex, buy bitcoin at $1000 for 10BTC, then go to say Vos and trade for cash  for $12000,  I would probably lose money in fees?
edit: nevermind, just read  posted below.  I guess the differences are already accounted for.
