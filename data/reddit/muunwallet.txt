We are currently working on this exact feature (starting with Trezor though). Really glad to see you will find it useful! Expect to see it live very soon!

Thank you very much! We'll consider your suggestion!

Not for the moment. We are a Bitcoin first wallet and we plan to address privacy and speed in Bitcoin. We are working on supporting Lightning Network and closely following implementations like schnorr signatures and scriptless scripts for improved privacy.

Really good questions!!
1) In non custodial solutions, users should have access to all their keys (or at least a subset of keys that allows them to spend their money by themselves). That’s the only way to make sure your money can’t be frozen.
Nonetheless, these keys can be stored with different levels of accessibility. In Muun, you have one hot personal key that’s really easy to access but it’s not enough to move funds. A second key, the co-signing key, is also stored in your phone but heavily encrypted (password+cold recovery code). You can *uncomfortably* access this second key and both, together, are enough to move funds.
On a daily basis you are not required to use the co-signing key, since this would compromise on the usability of the wallet. Instead, the server provides the co-signing key. Notice that the server only holds one of the keys so nobody, but you, can spend your money.
2) You could query the API if you bypass the auth, but that won’t help you in de-anonymizing anything.
For each new contact that you add, you receive a unique master public key from which to derive addresses. You will be the only one deriving addresses from that public key, and you won’t have any information as to what master public key other users are using. So the only addresses that you actually de-anonymized are all intended to be used just by you.

Interesting question. We haven’t really thought about it. Could you please expand on how this would be helpful to you? What problem would the history of transactions solve to you? It would help to know in which country you pay taxes to learn more about tax procedures and requirements. Thank you!

It is as easy to use as Venmo. However, only you can access your transaction history and because you are using Bitcoin, it is global and censorship resistant.
