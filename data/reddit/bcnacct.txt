I just instant bought 2 BTC 5 hours ago and it still isn't in my account. I was hoping that it might be because of my other pending transactions, but I guess not. 
Slightly aggravating

when they honored your transactions around how long did it take? From cancellation to honouring
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:18:38
wow really? 
I sent a message to customer support a couple of hours ago. Thanks for letting me know, even though it didn't make me feel better haha

I completely understand your point, although i think you mean anyone making a scene gets help *first* no?
And while I am speculating about them helping me because of my tweet, it's pretty understandable why they would want to help me quickly. Aside from publicly broadcasting your complaints, no one is going to be able to tell that you've had to send multiple e-mails to a company to get *insert product*. But considering the public nature of Twitter and how many people are using it, people are way more likely to see complaints against certain companies on social media.

I just verified my account and purchased an "instant" btc. I bought it maybe 2 hours ago and it still isn't in my account. It says it should be in there by 4:28 CEST, but it is now 5:23 and no dice. 
Anyone else had any problems today?
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:52:16
yeah I think you are right, thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-28 14:22:08
how long ago did you send the e-mails? I believe it took around 2-3 business days for me to get a response. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 16:32:42
okay great, thanks for responding. I got really worried that I wasn't even going to get a response back from coinbase for 2 weeks so that makes me feel better. 
I don't even mind that my instant verification BTC didn't go through, I'm just a little peeved that I waited the week for the other 3 only to have my hopes dashed. 
Hopefully I'll be back on here semi-soon with good news about BTC in my wallet haha
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:43:29
I'm pretty sure mine took 3 business days, it should say when you're doing it.

just tried again with 0.5 BTC. Still isn't working 
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:03:08
For me it was that they spelled my city as 1 word instead of two.. its meant to be "X Land" but they had it as "Xland"
Also, if anyone manages to verify today and places an order, can you let me know if it comes through? I've been waiting for almost 6 hours on 2 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 14:41:57
what was your e-mail response time if you recall?
Like I said, they may have not even noticed my tweet and it could be total coincidence. I just figured it couldn't hurt to try
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:53:43
great to hear! 
Except now this raises a predicament. I kind of wanted this 5.0 BTC as soon as possible, so I'm trying to decide if I should put in an additional order for 5.0 BTC since the orders were totally cancelled, or hope that they reimburse me soon at the agreed upon earlier price. 
Thanks for responding!
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:27:44
Sorry, just to be clear. When you say two weeks do you mean you waited 2 weeks to realize your order had been cancelled? Or it took them 2 weeks to whitelist your transaction and then get you the BTC?
Sorry for all the questions, I just want to make sure I understand you right. And obviously my situation could be totally different, I'm just looking for general experiences. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 14:22:02
True that, was just trying to leave a helpful tip for redditors. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 06:42:36
Checked this morning. Both Instant orders are gone. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:52:04
thanks alot! 
So that is definitely what is happening to me. I only wonder now what the result is going to be. Are they going to send me the 5.0 BTC at the original price, or do I have to re-order the 5.0 BTC. I don't really want to do that and then end up with double the BTC that I planned on holding. 
Guess I should play the waiting game
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:37:25
I ordered some about 2 hours ago and still haven't received mine... 
I just verified my account. Do you think that having other "pending" transactions from before I verified my account will mess it up? 
@_date: 2013-07-18 20:20:37
yeah sorry about that. I sent two e-mails because both times *in my eyes* it was different problems. 
I have a crazy amount of coincidences happen to me every day so thanks for clarifying that!
@_date: 2013-07-18 16:10:32
the nicest dick? lol
haha jk. Do you think I should remove my "recommendation" from my post?
