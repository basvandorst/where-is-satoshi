Because they don't want to be responsible for anyone's losses if unexpected things happen during a HF.

I set my wallet in USD and deposited USD. When the funds cleared after one business day . I waited until the exchange rate dropped before I convert the USD balance into bitcoins. ( another 40mintues or so ) before I can withdraw the bitcoins.  From what I noticed it's still cheaper than coinbase with fees. 1.5% vs 1%. I do live in California so the ach deposit took only 1 business day. For ACH purchase ( not instant buy ) coinbase usually made me wait 5 business days before they release the bitcoins.
It would be nice for them to offer an UPFRONT RATE like coinbase/gemini so we can skip the work around, although I can understand that will increase their risk model for a new service since bank transfer may or may not go through and they have to fund for the bitcoins right away when you order and they don't want to deal with the price volatility.

I don't know what miners will do. Currently 880/890 have really strong support across all the exchanges, but if these break before the weekend, things gonna be nasty.

sounds good. gonna give it a try.

I think OP meant to say the discription of ACH entry on his bank transaction history. Also he mentioned $500 daily limit it has to intitial from the app. Regardless they should have requested the documents upfront because it gives user a choice to upload ID or not, but since they didn't say anything until the funds were received, the money can be sitting in limbo until OP can provide ID to release it.

Wait about a month and see if they will resolve/refund you the money. If they refuse to do anything, dispute the transaction with your bank within 60 days with a written statement of unauthorized ACH debit, and make sure use incorrect amount/date instead of never authorized the debit because you did authorized the transaction the first place. This is not the best approach but it's one way to circumvent the NACHA system. 
ACH debit does not offer the same chargeback protection as credit/debit card, but if the merchant is being dishonest about their disclosure, screw them.
Didn't they state it's a peer to peer transfer and the tellers are the one do the KYC/AML ? I was having doubt since getting the payment processor involve does not consider p2p. Definitely need to warn others about this before they touch the hot water.

They meant to tell you withdraw before a HF occurs, you can keep yourself updated since the Chinese cartel will given an annoucement before hand.

Imo. The teller fee isn't worth the risk or the hassle unless you raise to at least 5%.

Regardless of Abra ( Plutus Financial ) received the funds or not from SynapsePay. What's happening now is the ACH debit initialed as soon as users submit a deposit with their bank account. They are saying the bank accounts has been debited and the money is holding in limbo by SynapsePay. If a payment processor suspect a transaction they should deny it right away and ask for documents , and not debit the user's account right away then ask for document. You are right Abra does not have the funds from the users, but SynapsePay does. The documentation request should be UPFRONT like  all other exchanges to prevent any confusions

You should try it out yourself before name calling. 
I plan do some daily bitcoin purchases then move them in offline wallet. 
I withdrawl some cash from the bank yesterday and it's available the next business day as USD balance. i waited until the funds clear before i convert to bitcoin for the exchange rates that I want. Since now my wallet is in terms of BTC i assume i'm taking the risk of price volatility myself instead of hedging against abra's system.

I'm not an expert but they state they make 1% on currency conversion. Did you deposit bitcoins then convert the wallet currency to AUD? 
First you got a deposit of 0.00602 bitcoins to 1EQa4cXEcHsJ2C6UM1LaiqUp44KcNd83Pa
then 10min later abra took the fee out and you got the final amount at 1DKaH49AbPB7ZJBSAgTyxEhA1pHK2oFAby
I do see you got a final amount of 0.00593468 BTC incomparson to the 0.00602 that you originally deposited
My best suggestion is you leave ur wallet in terms of bitcoins so you are not hedging against their system and to avoid conversion fees? Free bank transfer is only available to US and Ph and so far I haven't incur any deposit fees. only 1% when I convert USD balance to bitcoin before withdrawing to offline wallet.
you can try dm this guy for more clarification since he works for abra.

because your activity triggered their bot detection. they run scripts to evaluate potential frauds.
Ask yourself- did you log with VPN? did you log on multiple account with same IP or same device? did you send bitcoins to gray sites. ( not blacklisted sites or they will block your account instead )

Wellsfargo is the shady as hell themselves with the new accounts fraud and mortgage lending practices. So what the hell are they trying to proof here.

The tellers that reside in a country, us for example, that has strict msb policy will get shut down sooner or later.  Abra as a company won't because they circumvent all the loopholes to exclude themselves as MSB.

Their processor is using same day Ach. If you submit a deposit before 11am pst the fund should settle in the afternoon. Your bank account won't show the debit until after the next business day. Coinbase uses same day Ach also but they hold the fund for 7 additional days to ensure there's no payment reversal.

If they cannot verify your info from public data they usually ignore you completely. Try email them and see.

WF doesn't close accounts for ACH transactions. They do close accounts for excessive wire transfers  where they consider high risk.
Also, WF cut the ties with Bitfinex and other cryto exchanges because they already ran into issues with the federal examiners. The fine will outweight the potential profits from them. Ex HSBC.

What I mean is costumer let their buyers deposit cash into their personal bank account all over the country. Most of the time wf branch manager doesn't  care about the third party deposits. What's causing problem is the man in the middle attacks where the depositor claim he/she was defrauded. You can look up to what a Man in the middle attack is.

I used to work for WF. If you only use the account to make purchase with coinbase, with clean funds via ACH. You should not have any problem.( Coinbase uses Synaspay and so are few other exchanges )  Costumers that I know had their accounts closed were accepting cash deposits on localbitcoins or had questionable activities like frequent deposits of MO/Cash/cashier check/Domestic &amp; Foreign wires.
If you want to be safe I would recommend a local credit unions because their loss and prevention departments are somewhat outdated.

On the exchange side there are Gemini and Kraken. On the purchase side there were snapcard and circle but they decided to shut their doors. Glidera, Uphold, and recently Abra are the few that still accept ACH payments for purchases but I doubt they will be around for much longer.

For people yolo in crypto they shouldn't need a mortgage. Recently I bough a house in Cali from a real estate investor from China with Btc and Eth. (my relative vouched for him and u can check my posting history if u think I just made this up) . We completely took the bank out of the picture in an international trade. I checked if I was to wire transfer the amount he wants . He will inevitbale deal with Chinese central bank and I will get some questions by my freaking bank and IRS. Seriously all the fucking regulations impose by financial institutions by us government is getting rediculous.

I cannot tell if you are being serious lol. 
First of all, you can check my comments that I fucking hate CONbase myself.
However, you are implying 100% Revenue = 100% Netprofit.  
I can guess there is at least corporate tax, insurance, maintenance, and FRAUD losses. Assuming they are smart enough to hire people from the midwest and not straight from San Francisco, labor cost should not be the highest concern for them. Fraud loss should be highest because that's how most online merchant goes out of business.
