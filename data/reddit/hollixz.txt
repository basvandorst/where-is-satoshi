I'm no pro... But I this is like the worst thing you can do investment-wise. You are acting on emotion based on whats happening right now. That is extremely risky. There are absolutely no guarantee BTC will continue upwards in this fashion... Not saying you shouldn't do it, it's up to you... but if I were you I would rather develop a more sustainable investment strategy and start saving. Sure it takes more time but you will potentially learn a lot about investment, psychology and risk-assesment along the way, and ultimately maybe become a good investor which I do think is more valuable in the long run. If you do take out this loan and it turns out to give you a nice ROI, you're still not a good investor, because you acted upon emotion and took a huge risk. Chances are you are going to loose it pretty quickly in another risky move sometime later.

This guy is like the donald trump of crypto currency...

Who says thats the primary purpose? Look at gold. It is also a currrency that hardly has any use in real life

Whats your prediction for btc?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:58
Okay, I dont have the experience so thats good to know.

mBtc should really be adopted... Then exchanges could adjust their fees accordingly...

Or as nothing happens bitcoin will continue its rise...

Changing the unit would make it easier for new investors to get into the market mentally. It feels better to buy 200 mikrobits than 0.002 BTC (probably not the right conversion there but you get my point). Also, it would regulate the fees properly because the exchanges would have to adapt their trading fees to the new unit as well. Limited supply will remain the same no matter what.

This is what people are afraid of... that it will dip down to 1000 again

If you could improve the learning curve for new adapters why wouldn’t you? 
Also, most people will never understand btc technology as well as for example an engineer that works with blockchain technology no matter how long they stay in this space.

O get what your're trying to do, but shouldnt you write mBitcoin in the title? A bitcoin is still in the 17 000 range...
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:48:50
Yes and no. For crypto currency to actually become the game changing technology it is intended to be, a lot of people that will never understand the technology will have to adopt it. 
However, that doesn't mean current price isn't inflated at this point in time for this particular crypto currency.

Shouldn't bitcoin be compared to gold if anything? I don't understand why you would compare it to a bank that works in a completely different way.

Your statistics says absolutely nothing of what people actually think of bitcoin, only what age groups primarily uses it. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 11:57:37
Why? It just might be older people dont know how to buy it - they might be just as positive though if you were to ask them.
