So what's the point then? What does doing this achieve? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:35:28
I honestly don't understand how people aren't getting this. This is actually the complete opposite of a positive endorsement. I love Bitcoin but this post is seriously making me think I need to stay away from this circlejerk of a sub if I want to have a somewhat non-biased and even keel POV.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:47:49
So it seems like it is more of a problem for someone who is moving BTC in and out of coinbase on a regular basis. For someone like me who is generally just looking to buy and hold the BTC would it really be an issue? I'm basically looking at just making a paper wallet, stashing it away and not doing anything with it until years down the line when the value (hopefully) goes up.

Ok extreme noob here, thanks in advance for your help!
1) I found the following infographic while researching bitcoin and it was one of the few explanations that really made sense to me. My only problem is i'm not sure if the information provided is actually an accurate representation of how bitcoin works. Can someone please verify it's accuracy for me?
2) Is it true that at some point no new bitcoins will be minted? ....and if that's the case what incentive will there for people to mine?
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:56:47
What do you mean by "auto-refunding"? I recently signed up with coinbase and just bought my first BTC. My intention was the same as the OP and saving it as a paper wallet using the coinbase system. My intention is too hold the paper wallet long term, not for everyday usage.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:45:27
I'm sorry but this is an absolutely horrible analogy.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:58:14
Exactly. I thought the whole point of bitcoin was minimizing transaction fees. This actually does the complete opposite. Which is why i'm not surprised credit card companies are on board with this. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:54:45
I'm already imagining a world where strippers have QR code tramp stamps on their backs and instead of throwing bills you scan them a few bitties.
The future is here folks.

How is this a positive endorsement in any way? He is basically saying Bitcoin needs to account for 10% of all global e-commerce transactions, become a top 3 player in money transfers AND acquire a store value close to silver to basically be valued at it's price now.
That means he is saying right now Bitcoin is vastly OVERvalued.
Seriously people takeoff your bitcoin tinted glasses. I don't necessarily agree with this guys points but lets not misconstrue what he is saying.
TO THE MOON!!!

It's all good man. I had a very similar thought as you and went as far as contacting robocoin for a brochure/pricing info before figuring it out. Still a pretty compelling business opportunity if you can get through the headache of the regulations.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:18:23
So on a basic level it gives an automatic flat fee plus scalable fee depending on the difficulty/size of the block?
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:41:19
It's all good man, glad it wasn't true! I was freaking out for a second there :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:59:29
How so? What advantage in terms of payment processing would this type of implementation have over fiat? This implementation is actually more costly. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:49:07
Keep in mind you would also have to pay a company like Brinks to refill/empty the machine... which costs money. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:15:19
How is it decided as to how many transactions will be in a block? On the infographic it says it will block all the transactions of the last 10 minutes, so does that mean it will literally block every BTC transaction in the world from the last 10 minutes? So in theory we could eventually be looking at hundreds of billions of transactions in one block?
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:27:14
Where do you get your information on the bid/ask? I'd be interested in comparing the amount of people on both sides as well.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:51:53
I agree. I like this idea overall but i'm not a fan of converting BTC to fiat with a fee, + the merchant still having to pay the normal fee. It turns what was once a bitcoin advantage (minimal transaction fees) into a disadvantage.
This honestly doesn't seem much different than me just converting my BTC into fiat via coinbase and than using my normal credit card/debit card. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:04:50
That's the thing though. This isn't allowing someone to spend bitcoin anywhere. You are spending fiat...it is basically just a prepaid debit card you fund with bitcoin.
So my question is how exactly is this any more convenient than just funding your bank account with fiat via Coinbase or another exchange and just using your regular credit cards?
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:40:37
You did a great job, thanks for doing this. I think you presented it in a way that was easy to understand for the masses while coming across very professional and businesslike. I'm also glad you didn't focus on the libertarian angle that many seem to fall into during interviews. I think the general viewer tends to become dismissive when people drone on about the federal reserve and fiat currencies.
I also have to give the reporter props because this is one of the few Bitcoin related interviews where I didn't see the reporter have a condescending attitude towards Bitcoins. She was definitely asking questions that the average skeptical citizen with no bitcoin knowledge would ask but it didn't feel like she was automatically dismissing it either.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:40:56
Personally I would cash out half of it and let the rest ride. You have to look at this as a new investment. Ask yourself if you had somehow saved up 150k would you be in the position to invest it all in Bitcoin? If Bitcoin keeps trending upwards as the bulls think it will you will still be a very, very rich man with "only" 60-70k dollars in Bitcoin. Don't get greedy. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:25:21
Agreed, this whole thread is frustratingly useless. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:00:04
My understanding by reading the brochure is that the mechanism that accepts bills isn't the same as the mechanism dispensing bills. AKA: They aren't using the same money that is pulled in to pay people out so it would indeed need to be emptied and/or refilled.

@_date: 2013-11-07 00:32:59
Has anyone used one of these? If you have what was your impression of it?
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:43:01
I've got 99 problems but a Bitcoin ain't one
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:40:51
How exactly do you view this article as positive? It is saying it needs to reach all of those milestones to basically reach the value it is at now. Bitcoin isn't even close to any of those milestones. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:48:30
I don't think you understand the reason people sell on Ebay. Ebay gives the average seller worldwide exposure and a huge customer base that they otherwise couldn't obtain on their own. I don't enjoy paying the fees to ebay/paypal but I understand the reason why they can charge those fees and why from a business point I am willing to pay them.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:51:39
So basically you just read the headline?
"Woo even identifies the three things that need to happen for **Bitcoin to be worth what it currently is:**
**Our fair value analysis suggests that to justify the current Bitcoin valuation**, it will need to (1) account for at least 10% of all global e-commerce B2C transactions, (2) become one of the top three players in the money transfer industry, and (3) acquire a store of value reputation close to silver."
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:09:59
...and finally how is the fee calculated? Is it a fixed amount? Or a percentage of the transaction? If it is a percentage is that percentage static?
Thanks again for your help!
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:26:34
.05? Wait so every time I move my BTC out of coinbase I have to pay .05? That's $11...are you sure that's right because it seems ridiculously high.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:41:47
How is buying a special card, having to recharge the cards battery, having to prove to merchants that the card is legitimate and consistently reloading it with cash really any more convenient than just funding your bank account via coinbase once a month and using the money to pay off your regular credit cards? 
...and 99% of businesses that accept bitcoin transfer them to fiat instantly for accounting purposes so your point about finding a place to spend their coins is pretty moot.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:17:23
tip me the bitcoins so I can verify the amount :) 
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:59:02
Ahh that makes perfect sense, I wasn't taking into account the transaction fee. Is the transaction fee paid equally by the sender and receiver or just by one?
