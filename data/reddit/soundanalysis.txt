No. I would not sell. Please read this article firt. Can we beat facebook? From 2 million users to 1 billion in 7 years? Bitcoins growth rate analysis.......

I missed Google, Apple and Facebook I dont want to risk missing bitcoin. I am sure bitcoins is a ALL or NOTHING story. So in 5 years you wake up with a lot or nothing..So a very small amout should be enough.

from wiki: Visa does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers; rather, Visa provides financial institutions with Visa-branded payment products that they then use to offer credit, debit, prepaid and cash-access programs to their customers. In 2008, according to The Nilson Report, Visa held a 38.3% market share of the credit card marketplace and 60.7% of the debit card marketplace in the United States.[4] In 2009, Visa’s global network (known as VisaNet) processed 62 billion transactions with a total volume of $4.4 trillion.
Its tricky to compare bitcoin with a financial company. I would sum it up the following way.
VISA has gov. support
bitcoins has tax and anonymity options VISA is not providing

ok now I get your point. There are also a lot of credit cards not active and counted.

...you can preoder one 60GHs hashing monster from Butterfly Labs, one from Avalon or you can buy shares from ASICminer (we will treat the shares as a virtual hashing monster with 60GHs in this review). We want to know how many coins we can mine during the rest of 2013. First we have to make an educated guess about the future hash power of the whole network. Our assumption is 50THs avg. hashing power for Q1, doubling every three months resulting in 400THs for Q4 2013. Using this simple model we earn 360BTC in Q1 and 45BTC in Q4.

Read this article first. Then check the facts. double check and decide..

Thanks for taking part in the discussion. I was compting power(3.5, 5) x 2 resulting in one billion. I think you took 350% as 2.5x.  But that wasnt my point in this article. I am sure that the community underestimates the power of Exponential_growth.....

Thanks sir. Will consider it in the next update. Being 1000% off is a big error. sorry.

Maybe you are interested in this ASIC review...
@_date: 2013-02-28 15:53:04
I am sorry, but if you have a potential gain of 100x, of course the path will be volatile. Its enough if you succed more than 1% in ventures like this.
@_date: 2013-02-26 19:51:58
Review ASICminer, Butterflylab and Avalon.

Thank you for your reply. Can you provide a link to this analysis. I will update the next version with this information. kind regards.

Sure could be one user with 1.6 IPs..just kidding. I know two ways to get an educated guess about the accounts. Track client downloads or take unique IPs. I am here to discuss new approaches. Any ideas?
Further there are many guys with more than one credit cards.....
@_date: 2013-02-28 15:22:16
Do you like to bet sir?

Thanks for your reply. Wanted to bring the first model out as soon as possible to discuss in this community. There is a lot of room to refine it. Sure you can model in difficulty, I choose hashpower. Basically its the same. I am sure delivery &gt;&gt; price &gt;&gt; power usage.
I collect your suggestions and will add it to the next model. kind regards.

Clients have to connect to the network during the blockchain download. On blockchain.info you can research the number of unique IPs. At the moment there are 1.6 Mio. Clients using a different IP. Compared to 1.25 half a year ago. Resulting in a yearly growth rate of 63%.....
@_date: 2013-02-28 15:26:06
I am sure the network can handle a yearly rate of 350%.
@_date: 2013-02-28 15:20:43
I would be happy if bitcoin takes some time, but I just wanted to show that their is a lot of room to increase in value. 
@_date: 2013-02-28 15:59:50
thanks. Work through them.
