How often are you building rigs that dollars above MSRP is a constant torn in your side?

This was confusing to me.
The exchange rate was "worse" than yours - in other words, the exchange rate he gave you gave you more fiat/bitcoin or less?

And that's the end of that article. (I should've stopped at "ex-Trump advisor".)

The fact that we had them means we deserved them.
We may not have appreciated them, but we deserved them.

Can you transfer the crypto to your private wallet or must they keep it in theirs? I didn't understand the site's explanation.

It seems to me they were operating in a gray area.
They were taking advantage of, via technically legal methods, to amass a small fortune.
My sympathy for these brothers has dropped significantly. 
Civil forfeiture laws have a huge potential for abuse, especially when used by secondary or tertiary organizations (like border patrol or local law enforcement) but when used by the fed to capture significant or international criminals, it's a brutal tool, a medieval torture device. 
These brothers had a business that was akin to what the mortgage bankers were doing when they sold these high risk products, knowingly giving mortgages to people who couldn't afford them.
Not necessarily crooks by law, but nefarious practices nonetheless. Who knows how much suffering their ways cost regular people?
I feel for the stress you and your families had to endure but I think your slice of humble pie was probably a just dessert.

Could this be a scenario?...
Chat ensues and scammers *somehow* gain access to his computer. They are able to see what he does on his computer remotely. 
As OP logs on and off they monitor. When OP opens their Trezor they are able to see his address keys? They remotely access his send address?? 
1) OP would have to be away from his computer *and* keep his Trezor open to not notice his cursor floating anonymously. 
2) Don't you have to confirm any send transaction by manually clicking Confirm ✔️ on the Trezor itself??
I'm just trying to brainstorm with my admittedly little computer hacking knowledge.

So if you had one of those metal seed key storage devices you would have been SOoL?
I've heard people stamping their seed words onto metal. But if you hide that in your home or bank, it's still up for grabs it seems.

That type of expertise is undoubtedly beyond me.
Although I am very good, excellent if I may add, at my chosen profession and area of expertise, I will be the first to admit that I have no experience in running or maintaining a business, much less one that grosses in the millions.
 &gt;  Everything we did was to protect the members of the sites. The whole purpose of the sites were to protect people.
I'm sure that this is an embellishment. I'm over 50 yo. Nothing that I've encountered yet is as clear cut as this in life. And especially from what I've learned dealing with small time business dealings.
 &gt; There was absolutely no way to filter out which advertisers were scams and which were not.
I believe this. I don't think I made my comments because I thought you willfully allowed illegal activities to occur on your websites.
You're running a multi-million dollar business (presumably) and not everything can get caught or exposed even if vetted according to the standards of your field.


That's fine afaic. IANAL. I am not a businessman. I'm taking for granted that you didn't try and actively break the law and did what the law required with regards to your clients.


This also bothers me. The even larger corporations do allow shifty adverts and the regulatory bodies seem to turn a blind eye.
Perhaps. I don't know. I'm assuming that Google and Facebook have their growing pains and they too could claim that an avenue they took with regards to adverts and scams didn't protect/did protect their users.
Bottom line in *this* particular case your website got involved, perhaps even used, targeted, and the government found this as a path toward making their case against truly malign players.
Perhaps this is the price to pay in the gamble of the trade you have cultivated.


IANAL and I'm certainly not business oriented in the least. I'll take your word on this.


Your record seems to speak for itself. Kudos to you. It makes this whole situation all the more bitter. Again, unfortunately, your business got caught up in matters way larger than itself and attracted the ire of the federal government.
**Follow up Questions:**
What do you think would have been the proper way for the government to approach this case? They may have been ignorant of your motives or not cared whether or not your business was complicit.
 
Do you think that more regulation, rules, laws, would address some of the issues involved in this type of business practice?

Thank you!
And so the more the price went up, the more the shorters panicked and started buying more.
But at some point this gets offset by those that already own bitcoin and want to sell it at the new higher price and so the price starts to come down again. Is this about (ELI5) right?
Thanks again!

One sudden uptick (explained interestingly in an article about short-sellers) and it's a bullish market?
Is that what passes for bullish? A sudden rise in price?
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:46:29
Did I not get it?
I thought that as the price started rising, those that shorted bought at the higher price *before* it got even higher - thus avoiding losing more money.
I.e. "I better buy now and just lose $100 rather than wait and lose $200 or more."
Is this not what was trying to explain to me?

Can someone ELI5 this article?

But isn't that really just due to custom?
There really is **no** reason why gold should be considered the, um, gold standard, of commodities.
