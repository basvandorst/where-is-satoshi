Lol, uhhh, what about being able to convert it into US Dollars/your local fiat? XD Also I was not saying anything about Bitcoin helping anyone down on their luck. Although it certainly can when you convert it into fiat...

Not that it's any of your business, but yes the person did

Easy to not get scammed. Just wait for the payment then place the order, voila!

I hope you don't receive the same awful treatment if you are ever down on your luck and in need. Shame on you for not being a decent human being!

Just to let everyone know, this person ***did not scam me!*** And I am very happy that I was able to help them out

I understand, I would like to help you out :) Can you DM me or something so we can exchange details?

I'd like to help you out if you are in need. Do you want someone to actually place the order for you? Or are you wanting to exchange cash for Bitcoin? Venmo allows you so instantly transfer funds to your bank account for a $0.25 fee. Usually is instant but can take up to 30 minutes I believe for some financial institutions. I am assuming you have a bank account with a debit card, yeah? Also saw your post from the other day. Did you ever reach out to those people offering to Venmo you $10-$15?
