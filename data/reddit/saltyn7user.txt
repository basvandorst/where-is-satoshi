Target year for 10 billion has to be around 2040 when there will be 10 billion people and everyone uses btc.

This us Roger ver vs BlockStream.

Bch planned this, they were going to mine btc until the 2x fork then jump back to bch to kill the hash power of btc. Now that hash power is moving back to bch. I wouldn't be surprised if BlockStream went ahead and did 2x without announcing it. They prevented btc destruction by canceling 2x.

Ethereum is just as fast a litecoin. How easy would it be to predict everyone moving to litecoin, it would take a while in itself but it could happen. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:41:45
Thank you.
