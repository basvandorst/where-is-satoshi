And the miners that are mining scrypt and basically buying bitcoin with it? Still useless then?
Like I said, I have done dogecoin for a long time just for the hell of it. I have been out of the bitcoin game for a couple years (sadly)...

I am going to write to you in March 2015. With either a frowny face, or a check.

Really? When I attempted to link the cards it said it doesn't support Canada yet. And it only supports the USA.

Only problem I have is the same problem I keep having. Can't buy with Canadian credit cards. It is proving rather difficult.

Thanks. Is Circle fairly trusted?

I am curious why you say this though. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:12:26
Well that is awesome. Thanks for the info. I guess I just have to wait until they decide to do it. 
Do you know if they will transfer to my bank account too?
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:55:30
Oh haha. Awesome. Well thanks all!

@_date: 2014-09-15 20:48:57
SURE THING RANDOM GUY. I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

Is that proven? When you look at gawminers and are selling hashlets that hash at we will say 5 MH/S scypt with like zen miner or waffle pool or something? They are just paying back over time? And if that is the case, why am I not just doing the exact same thing. I see you can sell your hashlets too.
