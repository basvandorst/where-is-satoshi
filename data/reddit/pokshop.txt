I feel like that problem is staggeringly FAR away, and won't occur until well past $10,000 per coin. If at all.

The only problem with Bitcoin is that other currencies exist, we need to start basing everything off the Bitcoin :D

Cool, np. :D

It's a shame, could be that we are seeing manufactured volatility by competing currencies/nations with lots to lose; could also be that Bitcoin just wasn't meant to be. I made other posts where I said "Either 1,000 or .01 by the end of April", but I would have put my money on 1,000. So I lose, ha ha.

What an amazing insight, I'd love to hear some analysis of this.
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:45:18
Can't find much info on that site about exactly what it does, can you explain it?
@_date: 2013-04-28 00:32:36


NOOOOO!!!!! -fuckin' chance, ha ha,

Information technology grows exponentially, I'm predicting $1,000 before the end of April. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:26:33
You can take my 401k, but you will never take.... MY BITCOOIIIN!
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:34:21
I think we will see either $1,000 or $0.01 by the end of April.

So now its "If it becomes exponential" when 1 comment ago it was "It cannot become exponential". 
Of course it can become exponential, and it will remain exponential right up until the limit is reached. Something can rise exponentially even though infinity isn't possible.

It is that movie, except the brokers accidently created a fake company that fucking ROCKS. So the movie ends with them selling out and actually totally screwing themselves.

Maybe not, we just spike the price and divide up the coins we have for sale.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:45:30
I'm hoping that as the value of BTC rises the amount of people selling vs using them directly as currency will mean that actual sell orders become rarer and rarer; this should become a positive feedback loop driving the price even higher.

My kid (12 years old) invested in 10 coins when the price was 4$ per coin, then the poor bastard gambled it away on Satoshidice after watching a video that made him think he could win.
I feel really bad, he just wasn't prepared to handle the mental aspect of gambling, and I don't have the money to replace his coins for him.

There is no reward without risk, but taking a risk and failing feels a hell of a lot better than taking no risk and never knowing.
However you seem to be on the right track, you MUST have some disposable income. I'm a college student living paycheck to paycheck, and I took a huge risk investing $120 in BTC at $37 per coin. Now I have $450, so the risk paid off.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:02:15
The coins themselves are purchasing power, there is no need to sell them if the system is propagated the way it needs to be.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:47:47
who would do that, just go on the internet and tell lies?
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:53:19

Rubbish, Iphone users are not nearly tech savvy enough to know about Bitcoins yet :D!

Keep it on your computer and keep your wallet backed up on a flash drive or to a gmail account. Safer than your money in the bank.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:06:17
It was just a quick example, I'm basing my assumption off of Raymond Kurzweil's 30 years of research.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:46:55
You don't have to buy whole coins, you can buy .01 of a coin for $10 or so. Please buy a cup of coffee worth of coins even every week if that is all you can do. You DESERVE to benefit from this, your children DESERVE to reap the rewards of their fathers insight.
Even if you are only able to buy one coin, that could still pay for your children's college education in 10 years. 
Tell me, can you really afford NOT to buy these coins?

Pssh, just another blatant example of the Bitcoin super elite blessing the dirty impoverished masses with their "Trickle down" Bitconomics. 
Ha ha, Jk. I love faucets.

Owning 1 Bitcoin puts me in the top 85% of the world, a feat that would take owning $1,000,000.00 in USD.

Funny story, I've been trying to get my father to invest some in BTC. I told him at $26.00, again at $39.00, again at $72.00, now I'm telling him at $126.00. 
What does he say? "Whhy oh why didn't you tell me this would happen?" I TOLD YOU EVERY TIME DAD! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:55:59
Ray Kurzweil is the f-ing Ben Franklin of our lifetimes, and he has spent 30 years researching trends in technology. He says once something becomes an information technology growth becomes exponential. [Look at the damn chart over 6 months, PERFECT exponential.](
Invest ALL you can NOW, this is the opportunity of a thousand lifetimes.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:56:37
My Gosh!!! You sure lucked out. If you've got all that coin lying around you should [invest some,]( I started dealing BTC in my local area and have been totally swamped. Can't possibly keep up with the demand.
It's so exciting, can't wait to see what the future holds.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:16:39
Right, so the best course of action is to do everything in our power to convince merchants to accept them as currency; which has been a concerted effort of the community thus far, luckily.
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:36:04
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:58:01
Oh I've been following him for quite some time, only just now realized that Bitcoin (my other true love) actually fit Kurzweils theories perfectly. I have "The Singularity is Near" on my nightstand, ha ha.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:25:13
Of course, because now he KNOWS any price drop he creates will quickly be consumed again by deflation.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:40:24
He believes quite adamantly that once something becomes and information technology it's growth becomes exponential. 3000 years of research is less relevant than Kurzweil's 30 years because only in the last 30 years has this situation ever existed.
You just made yourself irrelevant, and ended any interest I have in your opinion.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:03:31
You're correct, but perception about what the price should be has lagged behind the demand for BTC. The market will straighten itself out, I have no fear.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:42:46
It took one month to go from 25-50, took 15 days to go from 50-100, and will be at 200 a week from the $100 mark. That is a clear exponential.
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:32:35
