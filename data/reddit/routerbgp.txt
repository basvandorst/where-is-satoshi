apple pay is a gimmick. "look everyone, i don't have to pull a card out of my wallet!!! i can just use an app... AAAA Fuuck! im out of battery and i left my card at home and i have no cash! can i borrow your USB cable?" 
or 
" I'm going to take my fancy apple pay to the ball game, i don't need my credit card or cash!! Hey everyone.. Hot dogs on me!!   FUCKKK why do i have NO BARS!! and no card WTF!??!"
comparing apple pay to bitcoin, is like comparing a solar panel to a Popsicle

2. IPV6 is NOT a Cisco Proprietary protocol. Neither is I2RS nor SLIP  as they are IETF standards, so your point is about "mono-culture" is irrelevant! 
3. you do NOT know what SDN means! What the FUCK are you talking about? How is SDN going to circumvent what I explained?

I hope you're right!  


I'm also worried about microchipping my balls. This Government is not imaginary. You just have to look at the trends. 20 years ago, you could walk into a plane with no ID and a bag full of liquids. Now, they are looking into your fucking shoes with X-ray! Every single day we lose a bit more of our rights. When was the last time we got some rights? LOL
So, I maybe wrong about the date, but if we don't have a hard fork in our government (pardon the pun) we WILL end up with such a system. I maybe wrong about the date but it will happen. I don't think it's a good idea to keep out heads in the sand and wish for it not to happen. We need to talk about such things so more people are aware of what is theoretically possible.

you didn't answer my question. 
if we are all going to use BTC world wide, will .005 BTC be the average price for a pound of Oranges? What I really want to know is that, will the price for goods be drastically different, IN BTC, from country to country ? or will it be relatively the same like it is in the united states. yes, it varies from city to city but not by a huge margin.

@_date: 2014-05-19 21:56:40
I'm not worried about the manipulation of BTC by the government but the track-ability! Right now, you can go and generate as many Key-pairs as you want and use them to make transactions. My concern is the government saying that "YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE KEY PAIR AND YOU MUST REGISTER THE PUBLIC KEY WITH US OR YOU ARE A TERRORIZOR!!!11" 
With the current internet architecture it's really hard for them to track who is doing what!? but with the two upcoming technologies that i mentioned , mainly LISP and I2RS I'm afraid those days are coming to an end. 
If you think the government won't do that let me remind you that if you own a specific type of PLANT, the will put you in a cage!!!! a fucking CAGE! for owning a plant! Now tell me how they will not do X or Y! 
As far as Mr Andresen's comments regarding transaction fees, I'm going to STFU and listen to him as that is not  my expertise. I'm a network guy, I can tell you about TCP/IP, routing, bgp and such. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:14:19
Never too late my friend. 
Thats good that you have that programming back-ground specially now that SDN is taking the fuck over!  it's actually a huge plus!

Learn basic networking (get CCNA)  and then apply and get a NOC job! stay at a NOC for minimum a year and then apply for network engineering position. Everything you need to learn you will learn on the job from the other engineers.

By then, lets say 2030, IpV6 has taken over (most likely) and every citizen when born is given a V6 address, a Xcoin key pair instead of SSN. whats the point of SSN anyway... when you can just use their IPV6 address. 
I'm sorry, i'm a network guy ( as im sure you can tell by my name) I've been worrying about IPV6 for a while when it comes to freedom, and then digital currency comes along, and when put together, they can be totalitarian orgy.

So, if i'm worried about my family since there are riots outside, then im not going to work! if i don't go to work, and more network engineers do the same,  broken routers and switches will not get fixed, internet will shit all over-itself.

We wouldn't want to. The ISPs will do it if we like it or not. And as long as people can login to their FaceSpace then they won't know/care. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:12:40
Ive looked into Bitcom and I have some questions.   I'm pretty sure no one else has raised this concern. Also I stayed at holiday inn last night.

Cool Story bros! Bitcoin nodes, which are responsilbe for propagating the blocks all around the intertubes are distributed over  "More (1006)" networks, aka, ASs. 
now, big miners are all probably behind a few ASs but, if that happens, then we can POW change, and go back to CPU mining full nodes! honey badger will keep on doing its thing darling.
[fun fact, AS number for United States Army Information Systems Command is....... ](
im sure it's just a coincidence  XD
