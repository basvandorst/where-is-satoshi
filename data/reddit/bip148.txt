But... BIP148 is so technicool and totally not a chainsplit vulnerability like this one, nullc told me so, so it must be right... I guess... Tell me that nullc wasn't bullshitting! Besides, the narrative from the start was that in order to succeed, BIP148 required pumping (by 100% organic grassroots, of course, no astroturf and no artificial fertilizers, only organic fertilizers, like... erm... bull shit... that is bull feces, you know). It's how it works on a technicool level, you know, game theory and shit! GAME THEORY!!!!1
Edit: whoever is downvoting me is a bcash shill!

UASF is the real SexWit!

But... I like chainsplits and losing money. UASF!

That's the spirit!

Don't call this BITCOIN sub here shitty, you low karma troll!

But hey, mining power doesn't matter because they can always do UASF, right? Right? Luke told me so, so it must be right! Right? Users with ~0% mining power managed to beat the ~100% of miners, right? Don't tell me I have been lied to! Our UASF nodes could never get into the situation you just described and we could never get robbed of our BTC as a result, right?...

You FUD this wallet only to shill your competing wallet with "features" such as replacing the SI standard units mBTC and µBTC with some weird ass double and triple meaning word, almost as ridiculous and embarrassing as an altcoin's unit which is pronounced "bitch".

It's right there in parentheses. What's that supposed to be doing there? Mock? Confuse? Deceive? Prepare ground for a shitcoin launch? All of the above? Anything with such astroturfed bullshit in it (and whoever accepted it) cannot be trusted. Period.

Seriously: that's their own problem. Some people and sites have weird agenda, some even have evil agenda and ultimately their actions reflect back on their own reputation and compatibility with the rest of the ecosystem. There isn't always a way for the rest of us to prevent that or fix that. When they go full retard all we can reasonably do is let go of them.
What if a website tried to redefine a word like "dollars" as a Bitcoin unit - would you go along with that? What if a website used the word "penises" as a unit - would you go along with that? What if two websites used the same word for two different units, in contradiction to each other (I know of people who tried to do that) - would you be trying to please both somehow? That is not what normal, sensible, honest people do, actively or passively.
When I see shit like this unit, it has been a very reliable sign of deep problems. Not to mention that it is actually harmful to people who are new and don't know the whole shameful story behind it.


I'd rather not even post potential ideas here.

Exactly this! Please do! It will help us. But don't split your BIP148 Coins from your Bitcoins, so that we can replay them... er... repay the BTC that we owe! Wink wink.

BitFury betrayed BIP148 once.
