I would say the demand will increase. Its been showing up on the news a lot more and the government isn't doing anything to hinder its growth. As time passes hopefully it'll get more mainstream and the average person will take a look at putting some of his/her savings into bitcoin. 
In the short term, if the market crashes soon the Chinese will definitely buy in quickly so I'm guessing the market would correct itself fairly quickly.

Thanks. Feels great to finally get a tip. 
Not a supporter of litecoin? It's gotten rather popular and had been explained as the silver to bitcoin.  Had a friend just get in it. Should I not?

BTCChina.com. You can bitcointip me afterwards :). Site can be toggled for an english mode. You can transfer funds from a Chinese bank account as long as it has Internet Banking I believe. No transaction fees, but there is a 1% bank withdrawal fee. I am VERY impressed with BTCChina. Definitely the most legit place to get coins in China.

Would love it if someone could tip me my first bitcoin/litecoin/Ppc tip. 
A recent thread I created from Shanghai :)

Yes they're going to go apeshit, but are they going to go apeshit with sell orders at 7777 and 8888 as they may be satisfied with their gains?

Read about the silk road in an Engadget/Gizmodo article a year ago. Didn't think much about it until reading about it again during the silk road shutdown. Checked the price and was in awe.... 
Nope, I'm an expat living in Shanghai, so no Chinese relatives.

Basically yes, just trying to give people an understanding from someone living in China.

Yes I do see a future in LTC. Once the price of BTC stabilizes more definitely. It is a cheaper alternative to bitcion as the Chinese don't plan on spending it in the near future.

Really wish I could get on CCTV to tell the 1.35 billions people that the price of bitcoin will go up in the next few months...
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:47:28
Ah. Thanks for the tips. I'll definitely give it a read.

None. The Chinese have a very confusing numbering system. They would probably catch on to what those in the West are using. As bitcoin grows, Satoshi would be closest to 1 RMB though.

Not sure about what the Chinese are going to do in the next week. They're really cautious about losing money and will typically hold on to their investments and wait. I'm guessing when the BTCChina price reaches rock bottom it'll quickly rise as many of them may have missed out and will want to buy low.

Got into a minor incident on the road today myself.. Some of the Chinese are definitely greedy bastards...
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:21:59
Same, there are a few bars in Beijing which accept bitcoin, but thats it as terms of usage of bitcoin. Most bitcoin buyers, I believe, are the middle-upper class who believe bitcoin will rise in the future.
Its always on the news, but the average Chinese person thinks its too risky/expensive to invest in.

Currently there are no indications that the government is feeling a threat due to bitcoins. Bitcoins have been explained reported on quite a few times in the past on the state-owned TV network, CCTV. Nothing on the channels gets past the party without approval, so you could say it is currently endorsed by the government. If the adoption gets more widespread, and stores/restaurants start using it to evade taxes... That might be another story though..
Why might they want to ban it or shut down exchanges? Easy. They want to control basically every aspect of their economy and country. If bitcoin gets too big and they perceive it as a threat, it will be gone. They can easily censor the websites, and possibly take down BTCChina if BTCChina's servers are stateside. Who knows. Read articles on the QQ web currency that got popular but was shut down. The party essentially was afraid the QQ currency would get too popular and replace the Yuan.
If the exchanges are shut down/blocked you can be sure that the price will drop drastically; BTCChina's volume has skyrocketed in the past and plays a big factor in the price of bitcoin.

It isn't illegal, it just hasn't caught on with the masses yet. Bitcoin simply isn't popular enough for to be used as a currency. The average Chinese person does not own bitcoin.

Yes. Pork buns dumplings are what real men eat for breakfast 365 days a year.

Ton of fake injuries after accidents in China. Everyone's just trying to make a quick buck.
I've got my BTC in BTCChina.. I really should store it somewhere else.. Even with 2FA I have trouble sleeping sometimes..

LTC, although there is only 1 major exchange, OKCoin.com.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:07:04
I guess we'll be able to see what thy do when we get to 7777.
