If I could add one to this I would say "You can never time the market perfectly".  If I would've regretted buying bitcoin at $450 because it later dropped to $200 then I would've never been there when it hit the $1k, $5k, or $15k mark.  Don't ever expect instant results.

I doubt it.  He makes 2% on each share.  If you read the about page he even says how much he made and that he traded it over to the right side for some 2200 bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:32:31
so the first issue is that they don't want to have to put in the work, second issue is that he doesn't plan on using coinbase or bitpay's systems where they change values to match the dollar amount they want???

Exactly, they made their bed and now its time for them to lie in it.  They would have probably made just as much money by implementing the fees so it makes me wonder if they actually did have secret intentions of an attack.

I stopped torrenting most of my music because its hard to find some of the stuff im looking for and also the itunes store has it way more organized.  The music industry kind of evolved past it (in my opinion) because they did just like he's saying and finding convenience and organizational benefits of buying it from paid sources.  And also, even if it wasn't a lot of people using it, it still wouldnt hurt them to try.

except that the casino can, at any point in time decide that chip is useless.  The casino reserves the right to not pay you anything for it.  Will this happen?  Probably not and they would be in a whole heap of shit if it did but it is within the realm of possibility.  Bitcoin, as a token for value has value based on the exchange prices and what the entire wolrd deems its worth, not a single entity. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:22:43
I mostly agree, however...
There is a HUGE difference between putting money into Coinbase and dumping it all onto an exchange just to let it sit.
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:00:44
clearly.  and I was aware of incoming wire transfers being accepted, but it seemed like just dumbass people trying to buy coins at a cheaper price when the exchange was still active without withdrawls.  Again, I would like to reiterate that i'm not disagreeing with you I'm just trying to give all parties a fair shake and reading the evidence as I see it.  What annoyed me is everyone assuming that he had stolen the coins becuase they are mad at him for their own poor decision (trusting an exchange which was publicly known to have already been robbed of millions over multiple years).  I just don't see it being very likely because I don't think anyone would intentionally put their own life in danger like that for a tiny chance that he would get away with theft and have to move to the god damn moon to get away from people wanting to break his legs.  I mean, had he actually been able to avoid theft he could've made that much money over the years completely guilt free and without worrying about people hunting him.

I'm not disagreeing with you, but what was the evidence of the amount or existance of a large wire transfer?  doesn't seem like it would make sense, if he was actually going to steal them he wouldn't leave a paper trail.
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:44:58

It's a business.  If it will take them a bunch of money and time to integrate it into their existing system and they can't really find hard evidence that they will make any additional money from it there is absoultely no reason for them to go out of their way to do it.

@_date: 2014-03-12 13:43:52
I bought some parts for my raspberry pi powered car stereo on tigerdirect using BTC, but that was only one time.  The problem is that the payments (like cash) are non-repudible so it's still kind of scary.  I'm hoping there will be an influx of good companies that do some sort of lightweight escrow service so we can trust these transactions a little more, since not a lot of mainstream companies are accepting it yet.
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:18:00
oh shit, guess I was right (:
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:26:14
I'm not expecting anything of that sort.  Just explaining the economics of it.  Im sure if they had a choice to pay employee wages on it and take care of all expenses on it they would, but right now if only few 'niche' business accept it and trade it all for dollars right away its not really helping.  
Point being that THE biggest hurdle that BTC will have to overcome is getting to the point where enough places accept it for it to make any sense for business like Overstock to not trade for dollars right away.  If it doesn't get there soon its possible that the price may drop down real low.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:40:54
Coinbase is good for new users.  I would use them until you are sure that you know of a safe way to keep your own coins.  
Research cold storage in the meantime.  Ultimately you want your coins to be in your own hands and nobody else's but Coinbase is a good compromise to ensure that you are best protecting your assets
Edit: If your coins are on an exchange I would get them out ASAP.  Especially if its BTC-e.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:56:54
it's the CEO of bitcoin feeling generous so he sells off some of his billions.  Damn it Winkleberg!!!
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:19:42
I'm kind of with ya.  The thing I hate is when the price goes down everyone treats it like a stock.  Im sick of people saying stuf like "Oh yeah bitcoins are tanking, told ya its just 1s and 0s.  Told ya it would never work".  The point is being completely missed.  People in the community need to stop making smug statements that it will hit 10k or other things like that.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:31:26

I mine Bitcoin so I use it to help me budget myself as well.  I only spend online what I mine and also I get the benefit of lower cost transactions and vendor discounts at some places.  No APR, no fees.
Also you don't have to worry about your identity getting stolen.  Last time I made a purchase with a debit card I got my information stolen due to the target data breach.  After that I decided to stick to BTC and cash only.  The only exception is if I go downtown on the weekend I will use my credit card because I know that only a couple of the bars down there accept BTC and I don't want to get robbed of my cash

for all intents and purposes, he is right.  He didn't say that GHash is the enemy he said Cex.io is. Cex.io is the enemy because they basically trick people into thinking that with their 10GH power they will get a 10GH worth of payout, but the fees are what allow them to make money and keep growing.  The system doesn't necesarily allow this because if you grow to a certain size as a pool your maintanence costs will become much higher and likely that you'll have to raise your fee to be able to stay in the market... They basically get around this by tricking people and having little to no transparency with their fees.  If people wisened up to what a horrible waste of money it is then Ghash would be forced to get a fee because they likely wouldn't be able to afford it anymore.  What I think will happen is a competitor will come out and do that same thing and the system will balance itself out a little more.  until then, we need to stop blaming guys like this for trying to police our own.
@_date: 2014-08-25 03:34:28
I legitimately believe that he didn't steal the coins.  The fact that he is afraid of bitcoin now has to say something.
Edit: then again, If he did steal them that would certainly make his story more believable.  But I truly believe that he is just that inept at running a business and security that MtGox had been ramsacked.

to add to this, since there is now an abundance of Asics out there and the last generation of asics is dropping in price, the people who wouldve probably just bought the bitcoin before are now mining because there are so many out there for a reasonable price and they don't realize yet that they may not be profitable (if that makes sense)

Things that they can [potentially] do: 
1)double spend
2)stop people of their choosing from transacting.

Now, people argue that they won't do this because well...  they are Ghash and we can trust them guys.. Just like we could trust Gox right?

@_date: 2014-03-24 14:03:11
I don't think the technology is in question.  But the price is dependant on a lot of other things.  For instance, if you look lately the price has been collapsing because people are mining and selling it all right away and there arent many new users of bitcoin.  More people are changing bitcoin for dollars than are trading dollars for bitcoin.  
This could happen even if people are using the technology.  Look at Tigerdirect and Overstock, they convert all their BTC to dollars so its not helping the BTC economy at all, even though they are using it.

The question you should ask yourself, who do you trust more with your bitcoins?  Coinbase or yourself?  If you say yourself you must be very confident in your own security.  A company that is well into the space of US business regulation and has a good reputation... I mean, obviously it's not ideal but they aren't going to steal your coins, and if you're worried about it then don't put your money there.

Coinbase seems to be a paragon in the bitcoin world.  Yes, they keep the keys but thats only so they can further protect your coins.  I agree with you, you shouldnt trust them with large amounts of BTC because well, thats just dumb to trust any entity that has complete control over your money.  But for Joe Schmo BTC user it is a more secure solution than leaving it on your own computer because all it takes is a keylogger for someone to steal your coins using the standard Bitcoin-qt

The value of mining is underrated.  What I mean by this:  How do you obtain coins?  
-you can buy them from coinbase (a good, safe choice) and pay 5%
-buy off an exchange if you feel like you can trust any of them, which I do not
-mine them and not have to give away a ton of personal info and credit card.
So there's that,  plus you can sell them on localbitcoins for 5-10% above market rate.
Edit: also localbitcoins if you feel really confident that you wont get mugged, which I don't (when I sell I'm not carrying any valuables other than my phone which has a shattered screen and GPS tracking)  
Point being, there is value to mining beyond making ROI, which you have a good chance of doing if you crunch the numbers ahead of time and only buy when there is a good opportunity.

I know i'm going to get a shit-ton of downvotes for this but Coinbase is a good option if you aren't tech saavy or aren't willing to put in the time to figure the whole secure storage thing out.  
Yes, they pretty much own your coins because they have the private keys but until someone comes out with a simple secure storage solution this might be the best thing we have.  
Edit: Bitcoin will not ever become widely adopted by the masses until we as a community stop making it seem so scary for people.  If everyone is already trusting banks with their money then coinbase really isn't that big of a jump.  Not what I would prefer but the technology just hasn't come out yet.

Why do people pay for cloudhashing anyway?  Can they not do the math to realize that its not profitable?

The $1200 bubble happened because of a ton of people in China buying up BTC [for the most part].  Now we are seeing most of the Chinese ditching their BTC and the resulting panic selling.  If I had to make a bold prediction here, I'm pretty sure once it bottoms out here this is the lowest you will ever see it get from here forward.  It is a good time to buy.
