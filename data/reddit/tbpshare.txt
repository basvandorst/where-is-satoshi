No comic relief ?

No. For anything that uses bitcore-lib

BitPay, CoPay, Trezor a.o are listed here:
The bitcore-lib github links to the bitcore.io site:
The bug is described by braydonf as:
"The bug is when there is a leading zero of the private key and the hash during derivation does not include the zero. The BIP32 specification states that the size of the private key is always 32 bytes before it's hashed."

You're right. It is too good to be true. For this site you can choose between Ponzi, cloud mining or just plain scam. They are all pretty much same same. Do not place your money anywhere near this. Invest a small part of your savings in Bitcoins directly using exchanges like GDAX, BitStamp or similar and hodl

It could affect the recovery as Trezor uses bitcore-lib
braydonf writer that "The derivation in Copay (and anything using bitcore-lib) is incorrect"
Trezor changed to use use bitcore-lib in April 2016:
And Trezor is also listed on the official bitcore site as reference:

If your private key had a leading zero it might be affected, but I guess that is difficult to check with the Trezor

Indeed.... I would have liked some new suggestions on coding style in the line of these :-)

One can always hope the do the same for Bitcoin eventually

The .is site is still top ad search result on google. I hope more people report it to google - as per link in other comment

Someone made a .pdf of the article:
Quote on pricing: "The firm charges a fat 15% upfront set-up charge. If you put up $5,000, you pay $750 in initial fees. That covers buying the bitcoins, securing them in a digital “wallet” and arranging for a custodian to hold them"

Most Bitcoin Core developers support Segwit, but not Segwit2X (the hardfork part implemented in BTC1)
See what individual developers support here:

Are you sure your purchase succeeded ? - are you looking at the app or web ?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:34
Yes celebrate for owning a Bitcoin, but price will drop like a stone as BTC built up (expecting free airdrop) is flowing back to to altcoins. On the long it does look better though...

One way of collecting IP for S2X clients is to use the search in bitnodes.21.co site
You can search for 2X keyword or simply search for all clients with a version number that starts with “1.” like 1.14.5. Core clients or others that follow core starts with “0.” like 0.15.0.1
This links currently list the IP’s of 239 nodes starting with “Satoshi:1.”
With the list of IP’s you can the add it to the ban list of core afterwards. I’m sure someone can make an auto scraping if needed.
Another idea it look at the IP listed in the new DNS seed values only included btc1 software (eg. seed.ob1.io). There are multiple A record IP’s for each seed, so it may be difficult to identify the S2X specific ones.

They produce a useful first time wallet (web and app) and the website still have decent tools for blockchain lookup (despite some errors and hiccups).
Blockchain.info has taken some bashing in this forum, but all-in-all it is still regularly updated and simple to use. I often kickstart new iPhone Bitcoin users with Breadwallet,  Blockchain.info and Coinbase, but I'm sure others have difference preferences.
The wallet it is a web wallet and one can reasonable argue that a hardware or local wallet is safer. However Blockchain.info does not store or have unencrypted access to your keys, so if you throw away you blockchain.info passphrase they cannot help you (if you backed up your 12 recover words you can create a new wallet with access to your funds)
For anyone using blockchain.jnfo wallet I always ensure they keep the wallet id, passphrase, pin and backup phrases safe and separated. For new users it is very easy to forget this when you just have limited funds and don't use it regularly

 Blockchain.info website and wallet is operational again. Just checked

"...The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit..."
What does "implementation" actually means in this case ?
Assuming implementation means code it could be a pull request. It is most likely not fully tested or even running on testnet and even less likely activated on mainnet.

Blockchain.info is up running again. Haven't checked the wallet yet

Glad to hear :-) Thx for the update and the reason for the lag on the summaries page.
I only checked the summary link and didn't realize it lagged about two weeks before posting (face palming for not checking the PR first)
Is there a good way to search the PR's to find the lastest meeting notes as they are posted (e.g. label) ?
EDIT: wording
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:01:35
No weekly meetings since April 27th. I assume they have plenty of good reasons, or maybe I missed an announcement ?
The bitcoin-core slack channel is active with some of team members, but no official meetings for 3 weeks.
EDIT: No worries. The meetings are ongoing as usual, but the summaries (the link) lag about 2 weeks behind
