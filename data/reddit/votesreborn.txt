We may see the price recover over the next 1 - 2 weeks but then drop again, when the exchange allows withdraws in around 1 months time. 
Purely because not being able to withdraw for the month, will scare a lot of small-time investors, which means there well be a lot of people selling when it's allowed.
Buy whilst it's dipping, sell when it's risen and you've made a quick 5-10% on your money, buy them back when the dip in 1 months time happens.

Holding can mean to hold on to the Bitcoin and just not selling it, ever.
If you invested $1,000 in bitcoin and it grows to $10,000 worth of Bitcoin. You now have $10,000 worth of Bitcoin to spend.
Some people do just see it purely as investment for their FIAT money though. They don't 'support' the Bitcoin ethos etc, it's simply an investment.

If the ETF application process gave away any hint of a success/decline to the persons making the application, it would allow 'insider trading' so to speak on a large scale.
For example, if the twins had information the ETF was going to be approved, you would see them buying millions and millions of BTC, as they know the ETF will make the value of bitcoin rise.

You can't JUST look at the transactions fees and say they are bad for a business like this.
When they have a chargeback on a $5 payment and pay $50+ in chargeback fees from their processor, the slightly more expensive Bitcoin fee can 'in theory' be saving them lots. (No chargebacks with Bitcoins.)
However, they've publicly stated it was purely because not enough people used the payment options. 
You're little rant about fee's bring the problem, was not valid for them.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:48:35
Flawed theory. 
They wouldn't have any information given to them, to make them 'think' it may get turned down, or get approved for the matter.

If the ETF is approved, china will not ban Bitcoin. 
The ETF approval would cause the price to rise. 
China is very corrupt. The government there will do anything they can to make money. Knowing an ETF approval will cause the price to rise, they will want to ride the money train.

It's not a direct sign that the ETF may be approved.
It's just more people thinking that the closer to the deadline it's getting, the more chance it will be approved. Which isn't how the process works...
However, armchair investors see it like that, so are putting more money in, in case they 'lose out.'
The only problem with this, is if it's declined, we'll see a harder crash as people will panic and sell.

"Funny thing about quotations is they're usually the most relevant excerpts from a larger bit of text."
The problem with excerpts and quotations is that you have to ensure that CONTEXT is included otherwise the quotations are misleading. 
"Did he say bitcoin was better that currency? Yes."
This is a good example. He did NOT make a general statement that bitcoin was better than currency. You've left out his reasoning for the answer, which is the context of his answer.
Your excerpt gives the impression of an overall 'yes' answer, which was not the case. He said it was better because you don't have to be in the same place physically to transfer the money. (one of the reasons given)
He only said it was better for that reason.  That does not mean he thinks bitcoin is better than currency overall.

You're trying to make arguments from points you've thought up yourself, with complete disregard to what was said?
Where did I say that everyone who has insider information, acts on it? 
I did not say that. I said if the ETF process gave any hints of a success/decline to the persons making the application, it would 'allow' insider trading on a large scale. 
Not everyone acts on insider information, you are correct. However, if the ETF process DID give away hints, it would be happening quite often, because there will always be people that WILL act on it, just like there will always be people that will not.
It just doesn't happen... because the ETF don't 'give away' any hints. In fact, you can see all the documentation from the ETF process. It's all public information.  If the twinkle toe brothers have 'information' that points to an approval, then everyone else has that information.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:18:08
One of the problems with this ETF, is it's in uncharted territories. By it's nature, it's more likely to not be declined/approved until the very end as they have a lot more things to consider.

I would still want to 'know' there's procedures behind the scenes to check it's not money I'm money-laundering. Just in the general sense of, I hate crime etc and I like to see things are in place to prevent it.
Obviously, a lot of people withdraw/send this amount with no issues, like myself. We're not considered 'High Risk' for what ever reason, so it hasn't so far affected me.

Maybe I'm wrong. But if I am, I'd love to know what all the transactions are. If the majority of transactions is purely investors, then BTC is in a worse position than I hope. Because by your comments, what you're saying is virtually no one is using it for buying anything, at the moment.
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:10:12
You are in the minority at the moment.
It's based on the fact that there's hardly any places to spend your Bitcoin directly for day to day things. This is part of the problem that needs to be resolved to get mass adoption of the currency.

If you didn't, the same thing would happen. Money taken on suspicion of money-laundering, and potentially you being arrested.

Well, you do pay taxes, really. Maybe just not directly.
To exchange that Bitcoin to USD, you're doing it through a company or person that is paying tax on the transaction, of which part of that cost has been passed onto you in the process. 
Well, they should be paying tax (or at least reporting the transaction) unless they're breaking the law.

They consider it worthless because compared to other currencies etc, the usage of bitcoin is EXTREMELY small at the moment.
Also, they tend to consider it worthless because having $1,000 of BTC may be cool, but where are you going to spend it or use it? The amount of places you can use BTC for every day usage is very, very small. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:15:08
You will still run into anti-money laundering situations though.
Usually the processes in place to buy something with large amounts of cash, even if it was bitcoin, will require the company to ensure money-laundering isn't going on.

@_date: 2017-01-20 23:42:47
The point is they are both middle-men companies for transferring money of some kind.
Because of this they have to have effective anti-money laundering programs in place.
It doesn't matter if Coinbase has no idea were you money goes. It doesn't matter if transmission is handled by the network. They still facilitate the actions to get to that point. 
They still have procedures in place to 'try' an detect if you're a money launderer.

'There is no automated tracking of cash, no way for third parties to observe publicly, there is no cryptographic proof of ownership, and no world wide network of computers broadcasting and maintaining a verifiable accurate chain of custody for the entire history of those funds.'
This is true, but this is always WHY money-laundering with cash is extremely hard.
To spend large amounts of physical money, you will flag up anti-money laundering monitors at some point.
I forsee 'Bitcoin Casinos' eventually becoming one of the largest ways to launder money.
Part of that is then you have to provide evidence of how you got that money. If you can't give an accurate trace back, you will be investigated and more than likely charged with money laundering.
@_date: 2017-01-20 00:21:41

So I don't need to provide the first assertion because it agrees with your opinion but I have to prove the second assertion because it doesn't align with your thoughts?
Can you prove that illegal activities aren't mainly using BTC for illegal activities? Let's get real for a second, the amount of "normal" places you would spend USD etc, that accept bitcoin, is so small it's not even worth counting.
One of the main problems with bitcoin revolves around the fact that the majority of places do not accept bitcoin. It's fuelled by the underground industries at the moment. There are simple not enough places that accept bitcoin for 'normal' transactions to be the bulk of paid transactions. It's literally impossible. You're not telling me that things like the  Ol' Steam store and Peter that sells Pizza for BTC is fuelling so many transactions? This leaves only two possible things, investors buying/selling and illegal markets.
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:32:39
In some sort of ways, it's a good thing. It reduces the instability going forward when the market knows what to expect from the past.

@_date: 2017-01-19 21:12:53
Well, of course cash is still used for more illegal purposes... as there's more of it around.

You've just replied stating that you made a mistake, so I was correct. Can't have paranoia when I was correct.
In regards to JamesKWayne, I replied to him in that thread. 
It's extremely odd that ONE person gets offered these loans. We have no-one else talking about these loans on Twitter, Reddit or on blogs. Not even the largest Bitcoin blogs in the industry.
Just a single person on reddit. The person who denies to provide any proof or evidence. Yet, it seems that another completely random person happens to stumble across the same thread to back it up.

It's actually showing that all 5 of your predictions, were wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-15 11:24:42
Well they can regulate it to a point that it stops the market growing.
The can regulate the way you buy/sell bitcoin.
They can regulate the way it's accepted at online stores.
Now, regulating it for people that earn it from mining, and then spend it in un-lawful stores that don't comply with normal company laws, is a different things, yes.
However, at that point your then into a dark net of money laundering etc. Which also happens 'unregulated' in cash. It's just that the second that you do something wrong or stupid, you'll end up in prison.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:24:57

Which was pretty obvious...
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:41:35
I don't know about the country that you're in, but if you're do what you said above in the UK, you most certainly come across regulations.
Currently in the UK buying Bitcoin is considered an investment (basically) so you have to report that to the government and then pay capital gains when you sell it. Even if you do it in person.
Can you not report it? Sure. 
But then you're breaking the law. 
Bitcoin is still regulated. Ignoring it is another matter.

I'm not defending the bank on the length of time it took to resolve. That was wrong.
I am defending the actions they took to halt the account initially. All things together, show high risks of money-laundering. From what I can gather into the article, he's basically ticks all the criteria for being high risk.
Also, it's not 'his' money when it's in the banks hands. Legally, it's the banks money. 
When you pay money into the bank, you're loaning it to them. Hence why he doesn't (can't) sue them for millions due to 'lost investment chances' or something.

This is no different to a hacker putting a virus on your computer that allows the hacker to change where you *think* you're sending bitcoin.
All currencies will have security flaws outside of the currency/payment method directly. That will never change.
However, with Bitcoin it's worse. If I get my card skimmed, I'm more than likely getting my money back.
If I have a virus on my computer that sends Bitcoin elsewhere, there's no recourse. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:54:40
I believe you're correct, yes.
It's important to note it doesn't directly get taken off the tax. It gets taken off the "revenue" so to speak, which usually has a side effect of lowering tax.
Otherwise you could in theory, set a investment/company to never pay taxes.

Just like they do with fiat money.
You report it, or they'll find other ways to found out. If they struggle with people reporting it etc, they'll just put a tax on the exchange level.
That cost will then be passed on when you make a purchase/sell etc.
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:15:16

@_date: 2017-01-23 12:05:09
'What wasn't clear from the article is if the bank is legally entitled to confiscate the money'
Well, the banks have a legal duty to hold the funds if it's got suspicions of money-laundering. 
So your high-court idea is straight out the window.
Why do people instantly think something is illegal because someone does something they don't like/want. It's not as straight-forward as that.

@_date: 2017-01-13 15:38:13
No, no. You're missing out on the facts of the predictions and my point.
The exchanges have ALWAYS offered loans. That actually isn't something new.
What we don't have, is proof of the loans being issued in the large amounts that this person was stating. We don't have proof of these large loans happening on the dates he's stating.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:09:11
He said the market will drop specifically because of loans.
No evidence of any loans has been given or discussed anywhere.
The market tanked because of the investigation that was started into the exchanges. Not because of loans.

We need stability for that. Employees see in the news that "Bitcoin dropped by 20% overnight" and then you have a boss trying to say it's a good idea to get paid your wages by bitcoin.
It just doesn't work.
Likewise, if you have a boss saying, can I pay you in Bitcoin? Its value rose by double in the least year, the average person just instantly thinks "That's a scam."
Stability is key before mass adoption can even be considered. People like to know the $20 they earned, is worth $20 (Even if the things they buy with it get more or less expensive) - They will never like the idea that the $20 they earned may be worth $40 next year or $14 tomorrow.

You don't write a loss in the UK against taxes. You write it off against your income.

You're TLDR doesn't make sense.

Yes, he's stated that as it matches up with his prediction. He's never shown proof of this though.

The 'It becomes rare and the price goes up' wouldn't apply to Bitcoin.

As a side-note. I have backed up my assertions. If you remove the large drug networks, what transactions do you have left? Virtually all investor trading.

'I don't believe the UK legal system has become that broken yet that banks can just summarily arbitrarily take your money without being held to account.'
The problem with the system so to speak, is that the money you put into the bank is no longer yours.

By law, their withholding THEIR money, not yours.

"Isn't the whole point of bitcoin to operate outside of govt control?"
So what do you suggest. The world turns to a currency that has literally no government control and no-one pays taxes because of that? Removing all the waste the government spends money on etc, where do you expect them to get the money if all persons/companies move to Bitcoin and pay no taxes?
"If the system is corrupt and unfair, people are going to try and cheat. Gold, cash, tax havens, off-shore accounts, etc. We saw it with the Panama papers."
The important thing about the Panama papers, and why most of them didn't get 'brought to justice', is because in most cases there, it was tax avoidance, which is legal. It wasn't tax evasion, which is illegal. The money was moved to Panama because the processes made it legal to do so.
"I also see post after post about how the govt "legally" took people's cash and bitcoin could have saved them"
This would be a tit for tat sort of thing. What about the times where people have had millions of dollars stolen from Bitcoin exchanges and there is no getting the money back because of the way Bitcoin works. Yet FIAT money (In the US/UK for example) could have saved them this problem as the banks would usually track and return the funds.

In this case, the person wanted to withdraw £60,000 to buy a property in cash.
If you wanted to withdraw £60,000 of Bitcoin to hard cash so you could buy a property, you'd need to use an exchange or something similar. 
Even if you didn't withdraw the bitcoin to hardcash and bought the property in cash, you still end up in a similar situation. The solicitors handling the property exchange would have to consider if there's a case for potential money-laundering.

This is a valid point. It looks like the bank themselves stated it was mis-managed and shouldn't have happened. 
Unfortunately, this article leaves out a lot of information that paints the bank as bad, but forgets to leave out important information which shows the person was being stupid also.
For example:
'It should have realised after the dozen 80-minute round journeys he made to his branch in Bury and the hours spent on the phone to prove himself.'
The persons at the bank and the persons on the phone, can not give ANY information if they suspect money-laundering. In fact, the people at the bank will not even hold any information about it, so it's impossible for them to provide it anyway. He would have been told the first time he visited the branch in person, that it will not and can not be discussed.
Him going on a 80 minute round trip 'multiple' times, would either be because he wasn't listening to what he was told... or he was bringing 'evidence' which wasn't valid and needed to keep going back.

That could be possible, I guess. Be a random thing to throw into the article though.
They word it as if he's from there.
In any case, if all your family came from areas that are the highest known-rate for money-laundering and you're doing things that look like what a money-launder do, it's going to raise flags.
Picking out specific things like 'Was he born in the UK' isn't what caused the blockage of the withdrawal. 
It's many things combined, which add up to extremely high risk.
For example, the article says he tried 'Withdrawing' £60,000. Now, this could be just a wording/context error on the article writers part, but it's very rare someone withdraws £60,000 in cash for a property.
'Transferring' £60,000 to another bank for a property, yes. Not withdrawing it in hard-cash though.

@_date: 2016-12-23 17:34:53
Yes, but all you're really doing is delaying those problems.
If you pay me in Bitcoin. I still have to get those bitcoins to my bank to be of any proper use for daily life at the moment. I mean, I can't pay my rent in Bitcoin.
So I get it sent to a wallet. How do I get that to my bank? I still have to go through the normal bank transfer delays and all that jazz.  
@_date: 2017-01-14 18:51:21
Let's say you mined them.
You still have to spend them. This alone leaves traces to who you are.
You're most probably only bothered by taxes if you have a lot of bitcoin. I'm assuming your not this against paying taxes if it's only $1 you owe.
You will never be able to spend a large amount of Bitcoins without the seller needing to know who you are. Period.
If you want to avoid taxes, but only be able to spend your $100,000k worth of Bitcoins on $15, Steam Gift Cards, you may get away with it.  However, that limitation is much worse than paying tax.
No-one is going to sell you anything over $60 (for example) without wanting to know who you are, or requesting information from you that leaves a trace. 
Plus, the people your buying things from are taxed. That tax is put into the price of whatever your paying. So you're still paying tax anyway, just a little bit less than if you declare you own bitcoins also.
You say that the government can go suck, but you're still going to pay taxes.

Banks give that security (or potential security) that if someone steals from my bank account, in most cases it's recoverable.
If someone steals my bitcoins, there is without doubt, no way to get it back.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:57:17
People having their money, is one of the big problems.
People like that security of having someone else keeping it secure, someone else dealing with any problems that may arise and handling their money.
At the moment, if you go to someone with £100,000 in the bank account and say here, here's your savings "secure" on a piece of paper, they'll laugh at you.
If they try to understand the good reasons of Bitcoin, they still don't like the thought of them being directly responsible for keeping 100k secure. Yes, there is hardware they can buy, but that sounds just as dodgy to the general public.

That makes sense.
Apart from the fact that "most of your workers" are in the Philippines because you can pay them well below what they deserve. No proper company hires lots of workers in Philippines for a good reason. It's always down to the cheap labour they offer but don't deserve. 
Why aren't your employees in the US/UK/Canada? Oh yes, because either your company isn't built to support a proper wage that people in these countries would ask and be entitled to OR you just like to engage in business behaviour that clearly takes pure and evil advantage of people.

Well my friend, that means I've just lost everything and have no way of getting it back. I did have $10,000 in my account, but it doesn't matter cause I thought bitcoin is cool.
Oh... but if I lose my bank card, I can just go to the bank to get a new one? Maybe I'll have to bring some ID but that's it. My money will be all safe and sound.

They wouldn't close your account purely for doing well. 
It benefits them if you're doing well.
There is always a reason, despite you wanting there to be a conspiracy that there isn't a valid one.

The Paypal rule they broke was regarding the taking of payments for pre-orders of products, that will not be delivered for months and months.
It's there to limit the risk of people inventing some random AMAZING (but fake) idea, selling millions, taking the money and running.
Bitcoin doesn't have an agreement that can be broken, however that is actually one of the downfalls of Bitcoin. From a consumer side of things, sometimes rules are a good thing. 
If they accepted Bitcoin for this project, they would have millions of dollars. They could literally put a sign up on the website saying "Goodbye" and run away with the money. Consumer would have no-recourse.

"Graph is always rising with a little roller coaster movement" ---&gt; "except 2013 incident" 
So it's not always rising. Something similar to the "2013 Incident" could happen tomorrow.
You can not say that historically it's been rising in the past, so it will continue to in the future. That's stupidity and further bad advice.
"I can guarantee myself that if I buy 1BTC today, I can close the buy-sell gap and get some profit."
The market could dip rapidly tomorrow and you would lose money.
""Buy now or tomorrow. Sooner or later, you'll get profit" -- "Graph is always rising with a little roller coaster movement" "I can guarantee myself that if I buy 1BTC today, I can close the buy-sell gap and get some profit"
These statements you've made are exactly why people end up losing money whilst investing or come out the other end with barely or no profit. All your statements pre-suppose you know how the market will act and that it's 100% guaranteed you will make money.
Obviously, because you can guarantee this, the market is always on the up (overall) and that sooner or later, you're going to make profit... you have people crawling all over you to invest their money, right?
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:48:05

Consumers haven't forgotten that they are liable for their decisions. 
One of the reasons consumers use Paypal is because of the protection they (quite often) offer.

Maybe you live in an poor area but most people I know have savings of some sort.

Not a good thing for you personally, when the price is rising. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:51:46
Then the price rises 10% in the following days of payment, you've given the an extra $100 for no reason at all. If you have 10 employees, you've given away $1,000 that could have been in your pocket.
(Could go down also, yes. But my initial comment is that it's not good at this present time when the pricing is rising.)
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:38:14

@_date: 2017-01-11 18:54:51
I didn't predict this crash. Nor did he.
He predicted it would crash because of loans. It didn't crash because of loans. We know exactly why it crashed.
He didn't really give out an accurate time-line. He said it would be a couple of hours either way. Which based on the fact that an average 'working day' is around 8 hours, is pretty predictable thing to be able to say.
I could predict that it will go back up tomorrow, give or a take a few hours.
There's a high chance that will happen. However, the main point of issue is that he's stating it's because of said loans. However, no-one has blogged about them, tweeted about them or posted anything on Reddit about them apart from this one single guy.
Seeming as BTCC is a large exchange... that's extremely odd.
It's funny how the one defender of him... being you... is stating they seen the offer also. Makes it look like you and him are actually the same guy.

"Only people that have lost money is the people that bought some in 2013 December."
You're assuming that everyone that invests, only invests long-term which is incorrect. Some people invest for a week, a month, 1 year etc depending on their investment requirement.
It can be guaranteed that LOTS of people have lost money in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:45:16
1) I am interested. I more than likely have more invested in Bitcoin than you do. However, that doesn't stop me from considering the cons.
2) For general day to day banking, there generally are no fees in the UK. The only fee's come from standard things like borrowing/loans, which will always exist, even with bitcoin.
3) Yes, that is similar to a bitcoin wallet app. But I don't have to backup my special keys and protect data that could lose me lots of money.If someone gains access to my bitcoins, I'm screwed. If someone accesses my bank account, they bank pretty often can recover it.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:07:11
This. Try explaining bitcoin to the general public without it sounding scary and telling them they don't have the "security net" of their bank.
Keep all your savings on this little USB port that you can lose, like you lose your keys. Keep your savings secure by writing some words down on a piece of paper. Yes, the same paper that your dog eats when the postman puts a letter through your letterbox.
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:32:21
Apart from your story having clear lies in it, the whole point of your fake story, which is to push in the statement "Doesn't matter because I have Bitcoin" doesn't add up anyway.
You'd have an extremely hard time living currently without a bank account. Bitcoin isn't accepted in enough places yet to be a replacement currency for day to day needs.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:21:36
That's another issue with Bitcoin. You can't really have a "true" escrow system. 
That middleman eliminates one of the main reasons Bitcoin is liked. The middleman can still run off at any point with (currently) no regulation to stop them getting caught.
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:44:47
If I walked out of a bank, took a leisurely walk over to my parked car and then drove away at a normal speed to do some shopping, it wouldn't justify it, no. That's normal behaviour.
If a group of people come running out of the bank, shouting, all wearing balaclavas... jumped into a car and sped off... you would say that shouldn't be investigated? That's not normal behaviour and extremely dodgy, despite none of that being illegal.
The point is, banks don't just say "he's transferred over 10k, let's investigate"... They investigate based on what's NOT normal behaviour for that account or based on information they hold. They investigate what is dodgy. 
The funny thing is... if someone had gained access to his account, transferred 80k to someone else's bank account and when he reported it, they said "Well, transferring large amounts of money isn't directly a crime, so we didn't investigate the unusual payment on your account."  - He'd be on here whinging that banks aren't strict enough on investigating unusual activity.
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:03:35
Well, the cost of that wouldn't be worth it for them.
Your point pre-supposes that Bitcoin is a threat to them, which it is not. Not anywhere close in it's current state and usage. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:54:28
Not really. You're stating it as if Mercedes bought a company that purely is a Bitcoin service provider.
They bought Paycash.eu - A payments system that accepts a vast amount of payment methods.
They didn't purchase this because of the Bitcoin side of things. That just happens to be one of the payment methods. 
Overall, this purchase means nothing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:25:30
So in this case, what benefit is there for you/your employees for paying in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-23 09:57:41
You don't really have full control over your money with Bitcoin.
You have full control when it's in storage and that's it. 
You try and withdraw £60,000 of Bitcoin to an online Bitcoin wallet service and you'll most probably end up in the same position as this guy, due to the anti-money laundering laws in place.
Let's get real for a second here. He withdrew £60,000 - That's a lot of money to withdraw. If I withdrew £60,000 from my bank and the bank didn't question it in the slightest, I'd be pretty concerned.
This article also goes on to basically say this this person in discussions with the article writer, had stated that he was from a country that is deemed high risk in regards to terror and money laundering.
A person from a country with high rates of terror and money laundering, suddenly getting a £500,000 payment and withdrawing £60,000. That sounds like something you don't want to just let automatically happen. I think the bank did the right thing.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:04:20
The problem is, that whilst the "general public" moan about the banks etc, they still like that sense of security a bank brings. Even if it is false.

@_date: 2016-12-28 18:52:49
"It is not mainly used by dealers and criminals."
Actually, the main persons using bitcoins are "investors" along with criminals and drug dealers. There aren't enough companies supporting it as a payment option for "general purchases" to make up a large percentage of the transactions.
Anyone that tries to argue that it's not mainly used by dealer and criminals (at the moment) is stupid.

Big numbers attract attention when it's not normal for your account.
If you were married, earning an 'average' salary and one day your husband or wife came home with a $80,000 watch on their hand, you would sure as hell question where that has come from.
You wouldn't just say "It's none of my business."

@_date: 2017-01-06 01:12:00
Don't be involved with what? I've made a valid point that it's hard to consider this a everyday currency at the moment due to the lack of places to spend the Bitcoins.
You come back saying... well, you can spend it at around 200 places if you buy gift cards with it. You're just backing up my statement.

If you look into the story, it's because they broke the Paypal rules. So this is actually the companies fault.

Yes, of course you do.

The company is not in financial trouble. They have a lot of money behind them.
1) You went to their reddit thread and saw a huge list of complaints? Behave. Have you done any research on how many customers they have? 
They amount of complaints you've seen is minuscule.
2) If you've worked in customer support, you will know that when it comes to complaints posted online, they normally fall into 3 categories. 1) The customer is just dumb and doesn't understand. 2) They post lies whilst knowing the true cause of the problem. 3) The customer wants the 'answer' to the problem to be the 'answer' they're looking for... even if that's not the real answer. They will dig and dig and keep going, despite evidence etc to prove their wrong.
Also, when it comes to 'problems', it's not always the companies fault. Even if that's the answer the customer is search for.
Some of the complaints may be valid, but most of them are rubbish.
For example, some of the ones saying their accounts were just 'closed' without reasons. I would place a large bet that those customers do know the reason, they just hate the fact they got shut out. IE; sent money to marketplaces known mainly for 'certain activities.'
Also, because of certain regulations, KYC rules etc, sometimes Coinbase can simply NOT give you clear answers on things. No matter how much they want to. 
Same thing with physical banks. If they suspect you of money laundering and close you're account, they're not allowed to tell you anything about the details regarding it.

What he's shown so far is literally a file hosting website. That could be setup in a day.
Setup a general file hosting service and use bitpay.com to accept payments. Re-direct on successful purchase.
What the true 'killer app' feature is, is where the files can not be taken down and are 100% untraceable to the person that uploaded them etc. He has not shown that in action yet.

That would be pretty much a gamble. Just like buying a house at all is.
1) He could buy a house outright and bitcoin continues this trend it has been on the last few years. That means he then pretty much lost tens of thousands of dollars.
2) He could put the smallest deposit down and then Bitcoin crashes hard like it has in the past. He then has lost the chance to own a house without a mortgage.
It's literally a gamble for him. He can only find out what the best decision is, after the fact.

Well, I mean 'technically' it does matter, yes. If you own BTC, you are required by law to report it as you need to get taxed on it.

I don't really see the point of this.
Lets say you made $500,000 and didn't want to get taxed much. So you move to another country.
What, you're going to spend $500,000 in that country were none of your family or friends are?  Having money in a country that you practically will have no knowledge of. What's the point.

That's a very true point.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:10:08
"And unlike 99% of people his age he's been smart and refused to become a debt slave."
He invested $10,000 in bitcoin. Which is a highly unstable, unpredictable market. Most probably one of the riskiest 'general' investments you make.
It's easy to say he's smart AFTER the fact. However, for someone to invest such as high amount ($10,000) at the age of 22, in such a risky market, it would actually be considered extremely stupid. 
You can't call someone smart because they gambled their money on Bitcoin and won. He was lucky, not smart.

A backup isn't always that helpful. 
If we use the NHS for example.
1) A backup could potentially revert lots of medical information that is very important.
2) Backup to when? The device was hijacked due to a vulnerability. A backup would just remove the current hijack but it doesn't fix the vulnerability. It can just happen again. You would just be reverting back to the vulnerable system.

You are correct on this.
My point was about when it comes to selling it, which I didn't make clear in the slightest. 
I should say 'It does matter if the government knows you own BTC, if you ever want to sell or use it.'
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:55:54
That's the point though. He states he wins (or won) about 50 million USD a year playing poker.
That 'tremendous variance' clearly isn't affecting him if he's telling the truth, which he isn't.
His story is just filled with holes.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:02:54
Dude, it's pretty well-know that he has gotten his money from the illegal activities of his father.  His money is a from a trust fund setup by his dad.  His father earned millions from fraud and only paid a tiny fraction of it back. Money that has somehow been "lost."
Yes, there are people who have gotten rich from playing poker that have never registered for a million dollar tournament etc. However, this guy finished 180th in the 2009 World Series of Poker Main Event.
Do you really think that a multi-million dollar winning poker player (that has to be at the top of their game to be winning millions each year), would only come 180th in a tournament?
Do you really think that a guy that claims to have made over $50,000,000 (Yes, 50 million) in ONE year, never played in any high stakes tournaments? Come on...
I'm not saying he's not made any money from playing poker. However, his story of making all of his money from Poker is so flawed and filled with holes, it's laughable.
P.S - This is a great article that goes into a lot more detail:

**I didn't want that because I think that had nothing to do with bitcoin's real value.**
You've answered everything there. You've created a prediction that is based on perfect circumstances that fit what you want it to look like.
You can't not do something because you 'think' it has nothing to do with the real value.
Basically, your prediction is just numbers you pulled out your arse to try and make yourself look good but it's already been proven wrong.
Might aswell delete it as you've wasted enough time on it.

Which is quite funny when you consider it.

There will not be a BTC, ETF.
The reasons they declined it, have not changed.

If he got audited, you can't just 'say' that's what happened. He would have to prove that's what happened... which he wouldn't be able to.
However I meant in the sense of, the IRS will see a house in his name, with no transactions/tax etc to explain how that's possible. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:00:20
A neighbourhood? Heck, I'm waiting to buy planet earth, when all you guys have gone to the moon to live.

I own a lot more than 1 bitcoin.

'Slow and honest' growth is a hard thing to estimate at this stage of of cryptoland. It seems like fast and hard growth now, only based on the current 'past'. 
We could look back at this period in 10 - 20 years time and think, wow... bitcoin was growing extremely slow in May 2017.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:27:44
You clearly haven't bought the 2.0 dice. They increased accuracy by 10%.
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:13:35
That may be true. However, it's seems like a lot of effort to go through, purely to save some money taxes. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:53:17
What? Really. 
How does he explain where the money came from then, which he will be required to do so.
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:40:24
Of course it was. Why else would he be asking what the most attractive countries to live in for taxation are...
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:01:41
So you have pretty much nothing invested in it then...
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:37:47
Most ransomware like this, do usually release the files.  With the NHS example, if one person paid and it didn't release the files, everyone else in the NHS would be told not to pay it.
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:07:12
So it was his question then. Retard much?

You can purchase as many as are being sold at the price you're offering.

Even if he has a year to live, what's the point in gambling so much money? He will gain nothing from it. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:55:48
I would agree big risk like this are better to do when you're younger. However, taken the age thing into consideration, it was still a very stupid thing to do. It's just that he was stupid at a better age.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:57:47
Let's say he kept it quiet along with the seller. I'm pretty sure the IRS would want to know how all of a sudden he had a house in his name, with no income, bank transfers etc to explain it.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:39:18
That's if you can patch the system before it's reinfected. 
I'm not saying it's not possible by any means. I was just stating backups aren't always helpful.

For this current attack, you can check the information that the hijacking software has inside it. Someone posted this image that shows the 3 different addresses it uses:

This is a genuine question; what is the point of a review, if nothing has changed?
The SEC declined the ETF  for specific reasons. What do they expect from a review? For the SEC to turn around and say 'The reasons we give for denial were wrong so we'll change our mind'?
That's not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:51:04
Well... technically they're keeping the custom as you can't move away from it right now haha.

Have you seen the fees at Coinbase? Not exactly a good first impression for someone new to the industry. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:42:30
Interesting. Doesn't that mean that you pretty much want to have all your money in BTC though, as you would be getting free money?
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:06:15
Can anyone explain what happens in a fork anyway? 
Do the same two balances get 'shared' or are they independent. IE: if you buy something with one of the balances, does the other one get deducted also?
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:56:27
He would as he would have given up ownership of the Bitcoin, therefore 'selling it', well transferring. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:50:27
With the recent 'problems' they had, I would guess there was a spike in people wanting to withdraw bitcoin from them.
That may have a side-effect on them getting increase in verification requests.  So could be delayed due to that.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:29:49
He has basically been proven a liar about poker.
At times he's claimed he's won millions playing poker. Yet all the top poker players, all the largest poker tournaments (where you would win the sort of money he has discussed winning) have never seen the guy or had him registered at events.
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:51:07
Nah, according to your 'prediction' I'll be a trillionaire, literally.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:55:41
I think you're missing the point.
Why didn't you start from when bitcoin was first created or the year after? If you apply your formula from there... it wouldn't have shown the the massive drop. Your formula would show it as hundreds of thousands right now.
If you're formula is correct now, it should be correct if you put it back in time also.
The fact is, your applying your formula to a 'perfect' situation that you've created. Your formula is pretty much useless.
1) You've started it from a time-frame that fits what you want it to look like. 
2) It's already wrong. Throwing in the fact that it's a 'good' wrong, doesn't mean anything. You can't go around saying that it being 'wrong' is a good thing, because it's in your favour. Wrong is wrong.
Your formula is incorrect already and holds no meaning.
