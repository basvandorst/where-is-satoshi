Moral of the story:GET A FUCKING HARDWARE WALLET AND PROTECT YOUR LIFE SAVINGS, sorry to say but careless people don’t prosper

Wait a bit, fees are very bad at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:25:49
Thanks I’ll consider my options I think I’ll hold for now tho, yeah said other means bc don’t really want to say how. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:59:34
Hodl on tight!! I feel sorry for the newcomers at this stage.. it’s much harder to pull through the first hodling pains
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:20:23
could be scam double check before dling anything - no offence op
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:28
gz hope you get what you wanted from life
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:26:17
Ffs yeah so annoying
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:24:39
Not separate , tax is 10% on earnings(inc cap gains) above 11.3k and 20% above 43k I believe
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:14:19
Kinda same for my fam but rather than thinking it’s a scam they just see it as not worth the risk of it crashing.. been trying to get my brother in on it since September.. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:23:15
8$ is the best you’ll get in terms of fees I think, but as PayPal don’t support digital goods you could technically chargeback the money you send.. this is probably why they ask for such a high price of btc
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:43:17
You —
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:02:53
Temporarily yes, but I moved mine to a ledger after getting worried I’d be keylogged 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:12:00
Similar position here but I managed to hold on to 2 btc, having sold a lot of coins for sub 1k last year and some early this year.. Last time I sold was .5 back in July... I try to look at positives tho I’m happy I kept. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:58:05
And back to 10k
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:19:19
I mean yeah worth getting in on it, do sooner rather than later I predict a 10-20% rise before the new year
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:15:21
No need to pay at least $20 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:17:20
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:24:10
Love it, shame I’m across the pond
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:48:08
Just annoying they are bringing it all down with their greed
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:52:15
Yeah for $15 best to buy eth first, then exchange eth &gt; xrp on the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:45:13
$15 isn’t enough fees are $50
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:52:56
Yeah getting right out of this fucking shit the second it reaches the next ATH.. too much stress, ruins xmas, how annoying
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:03:56
bitcoins can’t disappear, if they are in one of those accounts they will still be here today. Don’t stop looking until you find them. Good luck 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:57:40
Yup do this, or look for an exchange with lower fees and no limits.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:22:37
Yeah it’s crashing and probs will crash to ~£10-£11k but I believe it will pick up and recover by mid January �� and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:22:13
I think a settling trend till the fork on the 28th
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:55:05
Very similar situation for me put in ~~ £3k this year was worth ~~£35k now £25
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:56:21
Gave me goosebumps! HODL
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:03:46
This is where we earn money. Many underestimate the control it takes to hold onto your bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:49:52
How much did that cost!??
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:53:14
Bottom line, no one knows but I predict a small rise up to the 28th of december
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:20:25
Yeah I think segwit2x, check how futures price jumped
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:56:48
Honestly, I wouldn’t risk it with dodgey trades tbh just ask your rents or wait a year 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:27:11
Lol @ $5 subtle begging
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:20:37
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:36:40
Worth it for the security as anyone could get hacked. Ledger and Trezor are the main companies offering them at the moment.
Highly secure
Offer multiple coins
Not free
Physical item can be lost easily
More awkward to send funds - have to plug in 
I fully support them as some wallets are only protected by one password so if you get a keylogger on your pc you lose it all.

2billion years
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:11:39
Try making a coinbase account that is the easiest way to buy to start with. If you want to invest 1k+ go to an exchange (search best exchanges for your currency). Once you buy some coin I recommend storing it in a wallet (again you can search for best wallets) not in an exchange. If it’s a significant amount get a hardware wallet eg Trezor or ledger. Good luck, and don’t panic sell when it crashes next week ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:41
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:09:32
Pick a wallet (e.g. exodus) then you can set up the wallet there and that wallet will have an address which you can send the bitcoin to, from the exchange where you bought it
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:50:28
Yeah it’s as simple as that, using the private key from the wallet the bitcoin was in at the time of the fork. There’s also been a bitcoin gold fork which you can claim pretty much the same way into a bitcoin gold wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:04:54
LOL at this after it crashes lmfAo I probs shouldn’t be laughing tho hahahah
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:55:51
Coinfloor is good to buy more than the coinbase limit. On the exchange section not the quick buy. Min £1000 though.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:15:44
Just a picture of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:06
Just went sub 11k ���� bought in at 11,4
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:04:29
Uh not really got a specific reason just that it usually crashes after rising a bit. But probs not until later December actually 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:38:50
Also just to be sure, careful when using private keys. Don’t enter them on any website 
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:47:36
Come on let’s pass 9 k
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:13:38
Haha no it evidently was, everyone seems to be in denial.. bet you weren't here for 2017.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:55:50
You and some others who commented seem a little brainwashed, it was a clear attempt at a price alteration indicated by how the price breaks through 9k with ease to 9.1k, defeating your limit order argument. 
Basically someone with big pockets thought they'd mess around with the price today and make a few bucks in the process. It's extremely evident. No point denying it, I'm a bitcoin enthusiast as well but I accept there are flaws to the cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:58:39
Well yes this is a smaller one than usual, still time for greater reductions
