Isn't it similar to gbtc?
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:32:17
I own gbtc so no address.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:27:52
I'm buying gbtc in my stock account and there are middle men.
@_date: 2019-07-22 05:51:42
Gbtc. No wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:19:11
Sell your stocks and buy gbtc, it takes seconds.
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:54:57
Stock account- gbtc
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:28:43
Buy gbtc stock
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:35:37
Can anyone give me a very very short version of how to buy btc and lock it up in a wallet? Thanks
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:14:31
Could people forget their passwords for btc to be out of existence?
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:06:34
How do I send them to my own private wallet?
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:39:11
Correct. Any links for steps to take to own your own keys? I am thinking it involves pages and pages of instructions, and still a chance you could lose it all. How many people need to reset their passwords because they couldn't remember them? Too hard to own your own keys for 99 percent of the population. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:22:01
Thank you so much for explaining. Much clearer now!!!
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:01:39
Thanks, but would coinbase be just like a bank and could be shut down? Thanks for the info but the rest of the steps are not obvious to newbe.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:19:36
Don't think they are fdic insured and can't be trusted
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:42:53
Problem is it's so hard to buy and hold btc that normal people just don't want to deal with the hassle
@_date: 2018-08-16 19:25:27
What if I lose my hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:51:09
Not true. Buy gbtc just like stocks.
@_date: 2019-10-05 23:29:46
Not me. I want the whales to manipulate btc as often as possible.
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:22:50
And it will be government created and controlled blockchain
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:28:53
True Because x=0.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:26:31
How do you know these guys are jumping on?
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:22:04
I thought btc is totally anonymous when using. Everyone has been touting this great feature of btc. I have been duped?
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:43:00
Whales have hundreds of millions and now realized that they need to get out before everything is gone. They have hit the jackpot and I don't think these guys will hit it again in their lifetime. There are so many reasons why btc will worth next to nothing. It's unbelievable how many people bit on this scam. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:28:18
Buying using coinbase?
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:56:09
Genius. You're the only one that gets it. LOL
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:59:06
It's not when I can get unlimited CME btc future's contract that is cash settled. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:13:24
I can just hold cme btc future's contract and be the same as the holders.
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:56:50
Go ask any normal investor how to store Bitcoins in electronic wallets compared to Trading Futures Contract. 9 out of 10 don't even know how electronic wallets work 
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:21:12
Correct. Fund managers have been doing the status quo investing and their salaries are between 500k to a couple million bucks a year or higher. Why would they risk investing in super risky assets to lose their jobs. These Millennials have no idea what they're talking about. They got lucky hitting it and that fad is over. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:52:33
Normal investor does not have access to e wallets because they are too hard to set up but all have stocks account and if they want to trade Futures, its just as easy. Normal investor don't care about spot market. They want cash settled when they get out. Your  Bitcoin scarcity point is mute because I can buy unlimited amount of btc Futures Contract comes Monday.

My Visa card that is tied to my brokerage account is all the adoption I need. Your real purpose that you listed are easily accomplished  by my Visa card and  brokerage account. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:49:21
What if you died in a car accident?
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:03:22
Now finally some people got it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:13:48
How do you move them?
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:56:46
Because wallstreet deluted these coins with their future's contracts. I no longer need to buy coins, just grab a few btc Futures contracts and hold long term without worrying about wallets and crap. Who knows what ratio they are using per btc.
