Generally speaking, yes.
People will spend their bitcoin during a rise in the exchange rate for a couple of reasons: the product or service they want is extremely rare, special, time-limited, or otherwise valuable enough to justify the expense, or they have a lot of bitcoin and are willing to part with some of it because (1) they purchased/mined their bitcoin for little money in the early days, (2) they believe in bitcoin as a currency and understand the importance of economy and exchange in the big picture, or (3) they think bitcoin is going to collapse as a currency and want to spend it on commodities and services while they can.
As a bitcoin-only merchant who's been in this since before the sudden rise, I can say--beyond any shadow of a doubt--this meteoric rise in exchange value has *killed* the bitcoin economy. Check out Bitmit. Notice how nobody is bidding on *anything*? It's the same for most merchants. I've managed to hang on to a little business because my exports are incredibly rare, but even my sales have dropped inversely to the rise.
It sucks.
And if bitcoin doesn't stabilize soon, it's going to die. Merchants will disappear (why should we stick around if we're not making money?), and the bitcoin market will eventually consist exclusively of hoarders and speculators. Merchants will move to a more stable, less volatile crypto-currency that people will actually spend. Someone will "fiat-cash" out, and suddenly people will begin to realize that their bitcoin can't actually be exchanged for commodities, and the value will plummet overnight. Bitcoin might actually survive (probably, even), but if the merchants are killed, well...  suddenly it's of significantly less use.

Buttcoin and everyone else who said bitcoin was experiencing a bubble--including bitcoin supporters.
Gold will probably lose more because it has more to lose.
I hope bitcoin will drop to under $20--or less!
All the people who bought in at $200 have freaked the fuck out and sold at a loss, tucked their tails in shame and disappeared, or they've decided to hold for the long term, hoping that they might make their money back in another year or two during the next bitcoin bubble. In either case, they're a lot less talkative than they used to be...  which isn't entirely unpleasant.

You should set up an account with an exchange and buy bitcoin. Mining is another animal entirely; it will be very difficult to make a profit of any kind via mining.

Good luck. Given the ridiculous exponential rise of bitcoin's value (according to fiat currency exchange), it's almost impossible for merchants to sell goods and services. I'm a bitcoin-only merchant, and I have to adjust my prices on a near-hourly basis. This sort of volatility is annoying and spooky. I'd very much prefer some semblance of stability over this scary-fast rise in "value."

Once the market stabilizes or corrects and remains at a reasonably stable exchange for some time, some of the media attention will cool off, and the speculators will calm down.
As a bitcoin-only merchant, I am sincerely looking forward to this day.
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:02:10
Of course! However, the sheer volume controlled by MtGox is the very reason they could get away with this for some time.
As the bitcoin market grows more mature, yes; I will absolutely agree that it will be increasingly difficult for MtGox to successfully manipulate the market successfully.
We're still in the early days, though (a fact many speculators love to echo). MtGox *could* successfully be manipulating their exchange rates (or did at some point in the recent past). I'm not saying they *are*--and even if they are, I'm not saying I'm upset about it. I'm just saying that angrily shouting down anyone who dares to raise the possibility is counterproductive.
This article is blatantly biased, the author is ill-informed and foolish, and I and many others are happily doing business with Mt.Gox...  but that doesn't mean that everything this author said is wrong, and if we're gonna be prudent and concerned for the long-term survival of bitcoin as a currency (or even as a digital commodity), then we need to be able to have honest discussions about this kind of shit.

I've always been confused by people who were really into gambling. I'll make a risky investment once and a while, but gambling for gambling's sake? Seems crazy to me. People who vacation in places like Vegas just absolutely baffle me. Vegas seems like a shithole; I'd never be remotely interested in gambling for fun.
I remember seeing some Lifetime movie, years ago, with my then-girlfriend's mom, about some dumb bimbo who had a gambling addiction and lost her family's home, her car, and just about everything else 'cause of it, and my then-girlfriend's mom felt so sorry for her. I was like "WTF??" To me, the protagonist seemed incredibly stupid and deserving of her fate.
I dunno. The only think I can think is that gamblers have some kind of serious mental condition.
So, I think you should get that looked into. You're not a fucking loser, you're just suffering from some kind of mental illness. Get it treated.

That's true, but there is a flaw in this line of thinking--I am a merchant, and I do business in bitcoin, not in litecoin. Period. I don't give a crap about litecoin. Oh, I'm not saying it's not a legitimate currency, I'm just saying that I don't really care about it, because I don't use it or accept it for my goods.
Say you go to your local Wal-Mart in Delaware (or wherever you live) with a bunch of Vietnamese dong. It's a legitimate currency, but they're not gonna sell you any groceries for it. In that particular situation, the dong are worthless, regardless of their actual value in Vietnam.
Lots of merchants like me do business in bitcoin. Not nearly as many do business in litecoin. If a bunch of them start to do so, and the market takes off, then, yeah, I might start accepting 'em, as others might. I'm not gonna take that risk, though. Bitcoin enjoys a fairly well-established market and exchange. Litecoin doesn't--and until it does, it's too risky for me.
Given that I'm willing to risk doing business in bitcoin, I'm obviously open to some level of risk, but I'm just not goin' with litecoin until more people start using it.
Personally, I feel that most people push litecoin 'cause they missed the bitcoin explosion and wanna make sure they don't miss the "next big thing," so they're trying to make sure that "next big thing" turns out to be litecoin. I doubt it will ever enjoy the success that bitcoin has enjoyed, though. I could be wrong, so don't let my opinion sway you!

Because the bitcoin exchanges are completely unregulated and non-transparent, and because people are foil hat-wearing, paranoid conspiracy theorists. Their concerns are simultaneously quite legitimate and probably overblown.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:35:28
Yes. This is called "entropy."
It is a characteristic possessed by many things. Gold, for example. Also, the entire universe.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:01:24
The fact that the time-scale for gold is longer doesn't change the argument.
Gold has some value as an industrial metal, but none, inherently, as a currency. It's just a shiny rock. In jewelery, it's no more valuable than iron pyrite or gold-colored plastic--not really. It's only more valuable because enough people--"the market," if you will--collectively believe that it is valuable.
It's the same for bitcoin. It has no inherent value, aside from the fact that it's rare and can't be duplicated (much like gold). It's valuable because people believe it's valuable. The market decides what it's worth--just as the market decides what gold is worth.
You mentioned that gold has been in existence for thousands of years before the gold rush--you're right; in fact, it's been around long, long before human beings were around. So has math, and bitcoin is just a math formula. You mentioned that gold was difficult (I'm assuming you mean that it was difficult to mine). So is bitcoin: it is intentionally designed to be difficult to "mine" and is designed to become more difficult to mine over time.
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:40:09

Don't invest more money than you can afford to lose.
Don't look at bitcoin as some kind of "get-rich-quick" scheme.
For some reason, bitcoin's rise is having this odd effect on lots of folks. They first heard about bitcoin years ago, when it was almost worthless. They never thought it would go anywhere. They maybe poked around with it, found it to be a decent idea, but lost interest. Skip to the present, and suddenly bitcoin is in the news--with tales all over the internet of a million-dollar pizza and early adopters making millions overnight.
...and they get depressed. They think, "That could have been me!" They think, "Maybe it's not too late. Maybe I can still make outrageous amounts of money, too!"
The reality is, we *all* heard about bitcoin years ago and wish we had gotten into it back then. We *all* wish we could be rich. Get enough people feelin' that way, and suddenly... we've got what we had last week--an unsustainable bubble guaranteed to pop before too long.
You're not "too late," you're not "screwed," but you're probably not going to get rich by speculating. If that's your goal, I'd advise you to stay away.

ANY negative comments about them as a buyer; anyone who wants to do anything "fishy" with payment, anyone who is in a desperate hurry to have this thing in their hands, anyone whose account is new, anyone whose account hasn't been active for a while... among other things. You absolutely must use registered mail to send it and keep proof of delivery. I dunno; I'm probably not thinking of everything--it's been a while since I did business on eBay. Be careful! Honestly, a money-order sale would probably be your best bet--you can make sure you've got the cash on you before you send it.
Be careful about someone who wants to meet you, too. There've been incidents in which people "stole" bitcoin--and cops, obviously, don't know anything about bitcoin and won't have the faintest idea what to do when an incident like that is reported.
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:33:04
The math behind bitcoin dictates that as the total processing power of miners increases, the difficulty of mining blocks increases, as well. It wouldn't matter. They might be able to mine more bitcoin than other miners, but it wouldn't really change much. If anything, it would probably *increase* the price--for no other reason than the fact that Google or Yahoo was suddenly taking bitcoin seriously (that would be pretty awesome).

I think that if the bitcoin is truly a legitimate store of value, then it is an equally legitimate as a method of *exchange* of value, as well. Wild fluctuations in its value (in either direction) make it less viable--as either, imho--and I truly hope that such fluctuations are temporary and won't last much longer.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:56:39

Good luck. I run a bitcoin-only export site, and this bubble has made it freakin' *impossible* to sell anything. Why would anyone want to spend bitcoin if they'll exchange for ten percent more tomorrow?
I am personally hoping for a crash, or, at the very least, a leveling off. We need some stability in order to increase willingness to spend.
FWIW, I agree completely--I don't hoard bitcoin; I maintain small balance but sell constantly in order to maintain my IRL export inventory. I'm hoping we'll get a few more spenders and a significant reduction in hoarders soon...

omfg Dude, it doesn't matter if you think it's bad or not; it's against the law and qualifies as criminal money laundering. For fuck's sake, I might agree with you, but this is not what is being questioned or discussed here. The OP asked if bitcoin's positive characteristics were mitigated by its potential for criminal misuse (whether or not we think those things should qualify as "crimes" is irrelevant). I pointed out that institutions that are perceived as "legitimate" are often doing the same sorts of stuff that the OP is concerned bitcoin could be used for.

This is a very badly written article; the author is all over the place and making a great many errors in logic. It's difficult to boil it down to its most fundamental arguments with all the gibberish and flowery language in the way. Let's break it down:






This argument is flawed. It rests on the assumption that bitcoin must be eventually converted into fiat currency. This is not true.
Let's take the author's own example: Joe wants to buy a bag of pot, so he sends his dealer the appropriate amount of bitcoin. The author wants you to believe that this is an inherently public transaction--and, in a way, it is. Let's assume that Joe buys bitcoin on Mt.Gox, and his dealer, upon receipt of said bitcoin, immediately sells it on the same exchange. Obviously, there's a pretty clear record of the transaction there. This would apply to anyone making any kind of transaction that uses bitcoin as a way to "anonymously" exchange fiat money via bitcoin.
However, what would that transaction look like in a pure bitcoin economy? Joe wouldn't have purchased his bitcoin on an exchange, he would have been paid in bitcoin for something else; say, the fine wooden cabinets he builds in his shop. He built one for Tom, who paid him bitcoin from his bitcoin earnings resulting from Tom's delicious hamburger shop. Joe uses the bitcoin from Tom to buy pot from Dee, his dealer. Dee uses Joe's bitcoins to buy groceries from Bill's grocery store, and Bill pays his employee, Vladamir, some bitcoin for his work. Vladamir uses his bitcoin to buy a truck from Mitch, who uses the bitcoin to buy a ferret from Al's Animal Farm for his wife. Al, rich from his recent ferret sale, swings by Joe's shop and buys a fine wooden cabinet.
Assuming all of these individuals used their own wallets, there is no way to track any of this. Of course, there is a blockchain record--but that's useless to any entity attempting to verify criminal behavior between Joe and Dee. Even if said entity were to gain access to both Joe and Dee's bitcoin wallets, there would be no way to verify that the transaction that took place was illegal--any more than if it had taken place with fiat cash.
In fact, bitcoin would be safer for Dee. Let's say that Joe and Dee meet in the park for their transaction. Joe transfers the appropriate amount of bitcoin to Dee's wallet using his mobile phone. Dee gives him a bag of pot. The two part ways--but Joe, unfortunately, is picked up by the cops on the way out. He tells the cops he bought the pot from Dee, who is then apprehended as well--but Dee has nothing--no cash, no pot--nothing. Let's say the cops know about bitcoin and ask her for her wallet info. She can always claim to know nothing about the wallet address to which Joe sent bitcoin. There is nothing that inherently ties her to it.
In an economy that runs exclusively on (or even heavily on)(or, for that matter, even not-so-heavily on) bitcoin, anonymity is not only possible, but strengthened as more and more individuals accept it as a currency.


Always be watching for people who use words like "irrefutably" to describe their own arguments. I'm not sure why the author included these sentences; they contribute nothing to the article, do not further his argument, and seems to do little more than stroke his own ego as he assures himself that his logic is beyond question (obviously, it is not).


Of course. Virtually all currencies are subject to this limitation. I would argue that bitcoin is actually superior to many others in many ways.
Let's use a currency that the author has advocated: gold. I receive a gold coin for a good or service. Is it real? I can test it through a variety of means--some of which the author has suggested. Is it heavy? Yep. Is it soft? Yep. Is it gold-colored? Yep. Those things can be quickly and easily confirmed--much like bitcoin's first confirmation (a confirmation which can be hastened by the inclusion of a small transaction fee). However, the coin could still be a clever forgery. I guess I could measure the coin's weight and displacement through a fine measuring apparatus, but that might take a little longer...
Suddenly, this argument falls apart.
The same could be said for *any* fiat currency. A great deal of effort and money is put into preventing and detecting counterfeit currency, but it obviously doesn't prevent a great many entities from attempting to use such false currency (and often succeeding)!
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:53:14

Well, then you're just gonna hafta decide. If you think bitcoin will rise again, invest again. If you don't, pull your money out and pray your wife forgives you.
I just read the "class-action lawsuit" post. You should know that under Japanese corporate law, the maximum amount for which Mt.Gox can be held liable is the amount they've declared as their corporate capital--5,000,000yen--which works out to around $50,000. Break that up with a class-action lawsuit, and you've got next to nothing.
I have mixed feelings about you. If you're real (not a troll), then I both pity you and find your stupidity hilarious.

The problem with using BitPay for sales statistics is they have a stake in bitcoin as a currency. We have no way of knowing if we can trust their claims--it would be to their great advantage to exaggerate a bit. As the first comment points out, the figures they're using for Silk Road are dated; the comparison is not accurate. As the second comment points out:


Don't take my word for it. Go over to BitMit--the largest bitcoin auction site. Notice how many bids there are? Almost none.
People are spending bitcoin... sortof. They'll spend it when there's something they need or want immediately, or when there's something that they can't get through other means. They'll spend a little for the novelty, for the amusement, so that they can post about it here on Reddit...  but they're not spending at a level that a healthy market will require.
You even said it yourself just now:


According to that logic, I would be a fool to spend bitcoin. Why should I? It's undervalued! I should hoard it...  right?
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:51:47


...said the *customer*. From the point of view of a small business, things look pretty different. Credit cards and debit cards are expensive as fuck; if they weren't so damned easy for the customer, none of us would bother with 'em.
Realistically speaking, though, customers are actually the ones paying this fee; they just don't know it. Businesses are forced to charge higher prices because of it.


That's a "safe" way to assess the average, but realistically, it's not true.
Furthermore, six confirmations aren't really necessary:


Furthermore, ultimately, it's up to business whether or not to accept a transaction. It's up to the business whether or not to accept a check, whether or not to ask for identification when the customer uses a credit card, whether or not to use a counterfeit-checking device on cash, whether or not to extend credit to a customer, etc. Businesses have to make decisions like this on a near-constant basis. It's a part of life.
Believe it or not...  most people who do business with you in person for relatively small amounts of currency don't try to rip you off.

A "mining rig" is a computer that will mine bitcoins in a cost-effective manner. This means either a computer with some serious video card power (easiest to put together, but these days, they're not very cost-effective), an FPGA (bit trickier to put your hands on, but it's about the only cost-effective way to mine without getting an ASIC), or an ASIC miner (very difficult to get your hands on these days).
Mining isn't worth it *for you*. I absolutely do not intend to offend you, but these questions are indicative of someone who is *very* new to the scene--you need to read a *lot* before you go throwing money at something. At this point in the game, you'd probably do better to just buy bitcoin if you think it's going to do well.

Bitcoin is not without its faults--as any other currency or form of exchange. I think, though, the positives outweigh the negatives.

I can't lie to ya, though, man; it's not all good. I'm a bitcoin-*only* merchant, and it can be a bit of a headache at times. Right now, the exchange rate is volatile as all get-out, which can make maintaining appropriate prices in BTC a bit troublesome (you can use a script to pull the value from an exchange and modify the prices as needed, but it involves quite a bit of trust in an un-regulated exchange... you can use a gateway like Bitpay, but it involves quite a bit of trust in an un-regulated gateway... or you can just change the prices manually, but it can be pretty hard to keep up!). Not only all that, but customers are pretty hesitant to spend bitcoin right now. Folks like bitcoinbillionaire are few and far between; the market is full of speculators and hoarders, but there are relatively few spenders at the moment...
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:23:31

Ideally, merchants *should* be able to sell *anything* with bitcoin, assuming the items they sell are competitively priced. Unfortunately, the reality is that people would rather buy their products with fiat money than bitcoin--and why shouldn't they? Their fiat money isn't gonna be worth 10% more tomorrow.
Actually, I'm a bit more optimistic, now that the exchange seems to have settled at under $150 (currently).
During a stabilization, I (and every other bitcoin merchant) get good business. During a period of explosive growth, sales drop off. Explosive growth = unhealthy market.

Both bitcoin and gold are currency/commodity markets that represent a very real and direct threat to fiat currency-based governments, therefore both are very compelling targets for manipulation and collapse by those same government entities. Fiat currency-based governments absolutely *must* maintain confidence in their currencies in order to function, particularly in times of economic upheaval.
It makes perfect sense when you think about it in business terms. Assume the following: You have a product, but there are competing products. You want consumers to buy your product exclusively. You have a *lot* of power. Would you not make it more difficult for consumers to buy competing products? Make laws that restricted its trade? Manipulate its price? Manipulate its perception amongst the populace?
Keep in mind that bitcoin is not *nearly* as popular as gold. Its "meteoric rise" in value is a speed bump compared to the mountain that is the precious metals market. Bitcoin's rise may be attributed to many things, but we need to keep in mind that it is in its infancy (if it is yet to survive).
However, it is ALSO very important to realize that many (if not most) of the people investing in bitcoin are pretty dumb. *I am not saying that investing in bitcoin is dumb. I am not saying that bitcoin is a dumb investment.* I am saying that many people investing in bitcoin do not seem to be following currency markets or economic news of any sort. This has been pointed out by other bitcoin skeptics, and it's definitely worth considering.

You should trust it about as much as you would trust a well-known dude who said he would be careful. They are not transparent at all, not insured or guaranteed, and definitely not a sure thing.
That all said, I trusted 'em with a little cash. If you're just looking to exchange your money into bitcoin, they can certainly be trusted to do that, imho, and once done, you can always send the bitcoin to your private wallet.
That was way before bitcoin were trading at near $100/coin, though. There's no frakkin' way I would invest $10,000 right now. To each, their own, though.

Does it? When I purchase gasoline, I might do so with a credit card. We use that term so frequently, it's quite easy for the term to lose all meaning. Let's consider it, though: "credit."
Think about what that means, and you'll see why this "time" argument doesn't hold water.


This is true for *all* currencies. "As the volume of transactions and the widespread acceptance rises, so does the value of someone" doing something nefarious in order to steal/make a dishonest buck/whatever. This is hardly an effective argument against bitcoin.


I'm honestly not really sure where the author is going with this one. "Obligation of sovereigns?" Which sovereigns? The government? That doesn't really make sense for a variety of reasons. The government (of my home country, anyway) is defined by its obligations to the people. It is intended to be representative of the desires of the people. As we have seen through the inflationary actions of federal banks, or even the appalling actions of the government of Cyprus against its own citizens, however, governments often have an unfortunate tendency to treat their control of currency as a privilege, rather than an obligation (or, perhaps that's how they would argue their point; "Sorry; it's our *obligation* to take 60% of your earnings in order to save our country's banks from their own poor business decisions.")


The '49ers who strolled into California, took land from American Indians, and picked up chunks of gold from muddy rivers were unfairly rewarded! Those poor folks today have to dig huge mines using expensive equipment! It's not fair! Gold is a pyramid scheme, I tell ya!
This argument is ridiculous.


The author does not understand the true definition of a pyramid scheme. I'll refrain from addressing that here, unless someone questions it further.
The initial miners of bitcoin deserve a high return. Why?
Their initial investment in bitcoin functioned as an opportunity cost. They could have done something else with their time and money. They invested in a high-risk, high-return venture--if bitcoin had completely failed as a currency (and it still might), then they would (will) have wasted their opportunity, time, and money. If the currency proves viable and tenacious, however, they stand to make a good return--as they should. It was a risk, as many investments are. All investors take risks, but when they invest wisely, they earn a return for their intelligent investment.
If bitcoin proves to be a wise investment, have they not earned a return? Bitcoin is no more of a pyramid scheme than the American dollars or even gold--the first person to trade a chicken for a soft, shiny, yellowish metallic rock was not being duped by a pyramid scheme; s/he was merely helping to define the concept of money.

Gold experiences entropy far more quickly than the universe. When it's on a boat and sinks into the Mariana Trench, for example, it's pretty much gone. When it is made into a dental amalgam and buried in the dead body of some dude, it is pretty much gone. When it is used in electronics, then buried in a landfill when the electronics are obsolete, it is pretty much gone. When it is irradiated for some reason, it's pretty much gone (for thousands of years, anyway).
Bitcoin is more or less infinitely divisible--in theory, to denominations that could (again, in theory) exceed the number of atoms of gold contained in the entire universe.

Extremely low processing fees, even internationally, no chargebacks, so no way for scammers to take advantage of you, no government oversight (until you convert your funds on a fiat exchange), much more privacy in general, and you may end up with a bit of currency that's rising in value, rather than falling.

It's buying a really big, powerful, expensive computer that can't do anything but mine bitcoin.
It's really, really hard to find ASIC computers without spending a crazy, crazy amount of money. You probably won't get the computer soon, either. It may take months.
Even then, you might not get one. There's one company that says they will sell you an ASIC computer, but nobody has ever actually been able to get one from them. Some people think they might just be taking everyone's money, but don't actually have the product.

Evangelical, evangelism, potato, potato.
And, again, bitcoin doesn't need people promoting it. That's the sort of behavior that causes people to be suspicious that bitcoin is a pyramid scheme--and, I can't lie, I get the distinct impression from a great many bitcoin evangelicals that they actually agree with this sentiment and hope to profit from that fact.
For folks who believe bitcoin is a legitimate currency and hope that it takes off, bitcoin is its own PR source. The only thing that needs to happen for its promotion is for merchants and customers to use it. Evangelizing bitcoin (just like evangelizing anything else) merely serves to make people doubt its legitimacy.
Evangelizing bitcoin is pushing this speculation bubble. The sooner said bubble pops, levels off, or at least stops growing at such a dangerous rate and the volatility cools down a bit, the better for all of us.
Well, the better for everyone except the "get-rich-quick" speculators. I don't give a flying fuck about them, though.

You're being unnecessarily antagonistic. I'm not here looking for a fight. I'm just asking you to consider the possibility. Quit being an arse; it detracts from your credibility.
Assume for a second that Mt.Gox possesses a massive amount of bitcoin. Assume that they (now) possess a pretty hefty amount of fiat-cash (presumably in yen, possibly in gold or other commodity of some kind).
Assume, also, that a significant drop/panic selloff begins to occur.
Do you understand why it might be in Mt.Gox's interests to simply take the money and run? Remember, according to Japanese corporate law, their liability is limited to the amount of capital listed in their corporate declaration (around $50,000). The Japanese government neither recognizes nor gives a flying fuck about some digital cryptocurrency.
The profit you expect Mt.Gox to make in the event of a massive selloff will be severely limited if they have, in fact, been manipulating the exchange rate. They would do far, far better to simply close their shop, claim they'd been hacked or something, and let the investors swing in the wind...

That all said, I'm pretty happy with Mt.Gox. They're not perfect, but they've helped bitcoin come a long way, and it's to their advantage to continue to improve.

True enough. I'm hoping it catches on, but I'm not too worried, because...


I am no different. I have a small (but growing) bitcoin balance, but I do most of the "behind the scenes" transactions involved in my business with my local fiat, and for that reason, most of my bitcoin goes directly to the exchange.
You are absolutely correct about this bit:


It's just that I don't expect a capable infrastructure to develop around litecoin. I'm not sure that one will develop around bitcoin, either, but it seems to be off to a relatively promising start (bitcoin atms exist, apparently). Bitcoin's volatility, though, threatens this start (imho).


I dunno; I could expect bitcoin to collapse completely and still say that. I actually don't think people should be "pushing" bitcoin at all; I think that drives speculation and fuels the sentiment that bitcoin is a giant pyramid scheme (and I do, actually, think there are pyramid schemers in the bunch, but they're idiots who are playing with fire and will hopefully end up shooting themselves in the foot--I just hope they won't take the entire currency down with 'em). To me, the best way to "push" bitcoin is just to accept it and do business with it.

Even I could write a script that would filter a page based on a customer's order... say, something that would show a certain price for buyers, and a certain price for sellers...

Again...  I'm not saying it's definitely happening intentionally. Not saying that I care. Just saying that it's *possible*.


So, the idea is to be kinda sneaky about it...


What if--hang with me here--what if Mt.Gox is in possession of a *truly massive* amount of bitcoin. What if they wanted it to be worth more? What if they faked a whole *bunch* of trades with themselves?
As long as people are buying, as long as there's a lot of media hype and excitement...  a powerful exchange could do quite well for themselves...
Again, not saying it *is* happening, not saying I'd be angry if it was, just that it's *possible*.


Would it? Because there for a while, Mt.Gox was responsible for 80% of all exchanges... Seems to me they would have quite a bit of power over the exchange rate... especially if one or two other exchanges (possibly in possession of a lot of bitcoin, themselves) were cooperating.


Sure you can. If you're in control of enough volume, in have a great deal of the commodity, and a majority of the public is under the perception that the commodity in question is in heavy demand...

Full disclosure: I'm a bitcoin-only merchant. I don't hoard bitcoin--I have a small amount saved that I add a little to every now and again, but most of my bitcoin are converted into fiat on the exchange to maintain my inventory.

*This is not healthy.*
If this is your reaction, you should close your web browser and *stop* reading about bitcoin. Many, many people "feel like they missed the boat." Don't beat yourself up over it.

Do not, do not, *do not* let this cause you anguish and sorrow. There will be many opportunities in the future--and this may still be just such an opportunity.

I don't care about the exchange rate as it applies to my business; that's inconsequential, really. I sell bitcoin regularly; its purchasing power generally won't change quickly enough to affect my business plan (hopefully, though this is a serious risk).

Because it's convenient, and Bitcoin is not. Because its value is somewhat stable from a relatively short historical standpoint, and Bitcoin is not. Because it is not losing its value quickly enough to be frightening (well, some might feel this way). Because your local Wal-Mart will exchange a small amount of fiat currency for a loaf of bread and a six-pack of beer, but will give you jack fucking shit for a bitcoin, even though it can currently be exchanged for a hell of a lot more fiat currency than it takes to buy a loaf of bread and a six-pack.
C'mon, man; there are a bazillion reasons, and you know it. Your logic falls apart.


I agree with this part, and that's the reason my business is still up and running. There's enough demand for my product, so I'm still doing business.

1. Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Basically, a computer that's built to mine bitcoin--and nothing else.
2. Get a mining rig of some kind.
3. It depends on a variety of factors. From the type of questions you're asking here, I would have to say "no" to you.
4. You provide a payment address or use a gateway like BitPay.
5. Yes and no. If it looks too good to be true, it is. Most bitcoin faucets provide a tiny, tiny amount of bitcoin; it would be far better to buy bitcoin unless your time is completely worthless.

It's *extremely* unlikey.
Why? Occam's Razor. They're [edit: Mt. Gox] in Japan. They're dealing with a new, unregulated cryptocurrency. They have a small staff and are presumably interested in making as much money as possible without wasting time on crap they don't need to do. They're not legally required to give information to the IRS, so why would they bother? It just doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:55:40
Bitcoin still exists in an odd, legally gray area. There are no laws regarding a "special computer made to work one very specific math problem"--basically all the thing is.

To understand why, it's important to understand how DDoS attacks work from a technical standpoint. DDoS attacks aren't one dude attempting to "hack into" a system, they're a generally a gigantic group of computers (the "distributed" in "distributed denial of service") simply sending standard requests to the target server. The server can't process that many requests and is unable to provide services to legitimate users.
There are many variants of DDoS attacks, but they basically work in the manner I've described. The reason you can't build a server that is immune to DDoS attacks is because DDoS attacks rely on the simple, fundamental commands that any internet-connected computer uses to function as a server.
You can build an incredibly powerful, capable, distributed server (say, something like what Google or Amazon runs), and it would be very resistant to all but the most powerful DDoS attacks, but this would require boatloads of money, which is why not many folks can do it.

The following is all hypothetical.
It's a month or so ago. The exchange value of bitcoin is, let's say, $60.
One Monday morning, Mt.Gox artificially raises the value by, say $.34, to $60.34. They could do this several ways--a fake account, a fake sale, or simply changing the information on their front page directly. Will they face immediate sell-offs? Probably not. It's Monday morning. History tells us that prices will rise even more as the day goes on. Will they face immediate sell-offs by folks who're jumping to another exchange, trying to make a quick buck? Maybe a few, but not massive amounts. Most folks only have an account with one exchange (and most of them just went with the biggest fish in the pond--why shouldn't they?), and setting up an account on a second exchange would be a pain in the arse, take time, etc. Ultimately, it wouldn't matter anyway--more people are showing up in droves to buy, and they're all under the impression that there's a massive queue of verifications just waiting to be done! That means there will be even more buyers in the near future! That means if they buy now, they can sell for more in the future! Why would they risk selling at another exchange, even if that exchange will give them $0.34 more for their bitcoin? It certainly looks like things are looking up!
So, in the end, it really wouldn't matter. Folks flocking to another exchange to buy quickly would soon be confronted with prices rising to match Mt.Gox--a few lucky buyers might snag a few at the lower price, but not many...

I absolutely acknowledge (and acknowledged pretty early on) that the author was appallingly and shamefully biased.


I merely acknowledged that they *could* be.


I disagree. Here's why:


Right now, *someone* is buying. So long as the amount of buyers significantly outweighs the sellers, Mt.Gox can (and has every incentive to/no incentive not to) manipulate the exchange rate *slightly*. Again, I'm not saying they *are*, merely that they *could*.


Again, this would only become a problem if and when the sellers outnumbered the buyers--a situation which the bitcoin exchange market has not seen for some time.


I don't. My understanding is pretty limited. Still, corporate liability in Japan is not especially complex. There's a reason these guys are set up in Japan, rather than the US.


Why would you think that? Japan, aside from their corporate tax rate, is one of the most business-friendly environments on the planet. Lawsuits are virtually unheard-of here. Have you read about any of the shit that went down with Olympus? Japan's business culture is one built on backroom deals, widely-overlooked corruption, society-accepted corporate manipulation, and a general attitude of "what's good for the powerful is probably good for society."
AGAIN--I am a happy customer of Mt.Gox, a happy bitcoin enthusiast, and a happy resident of Japan. I am not looking to rock the boat or sabotage bitcoin in any way whatsoever.
I merely encourage all those who would be involved with bitcoin, Mt.Gox, or *any* business or merchant to approach their interactions with an open mind, a skeptical attitude, a healthy sense of caution, and a willingness to make an informed decision. In this case, my instincts and logic tell me that Mt.Gox *could* be *slightly* manipulating the exchange rate (or may have in the past)--yet, I am still happy to do business with them, and would not discourage others from doing so. Just do so with an open mind.

I hope all the speculators join you. It will be fucking awesome to see bitcoin behave like a non-volatile currency again.

Unlike the vast majority of folks here, I'm not looking to get rich off bitcoin, I'm looking to make a decent living with my business and maintain a relatively diverse portfolio with a few safe assets. I have pretty limited sympathy for speculators who showed up dreaming of becoming a "bitcoin millionaire" overnight.

For your final point 1:
Some retailers have been accepting BTC (me, for example), but intense volatility has made it near-impossible to do business. The only businesses that are actually receiving BTC in payment are either businesses that sell products that are illegal in some markets or businesses that market to people who have plenty of BTC to blow for fun (oooh, look, you can buy a Lamborghini with BTC--that's relevant to soooo many people). Most of the businesses that accept BTC are run by folks who are in it to play the speculation game.
I'm one of the former business owners. Initially, I was optimistic about BTC because it allowed me to market a product that--legal in my country--was illegal in many nations.
I did business for a while--and have been able to continue doing so to an extremely limited extent--but this volatility has made it extraordinarily difficult. My business is more like a hobby; a way to make a little income on the side via a market in which I am already interested. For someone trying to do business on a near full-time basis, volatility is a killer.
I dunno where I'm going with all this. I guess I agree with you to a large extent.... Bitcoin just isn't ready. I wish it were. These growing pains are quite unpleasant.

They would build up a healthy supply of bitcoin, then very carefully and gradually raise the exchange rate--never too quickly, never too much; just enough to sustain the idea that bitcoin were selling for more than they were the day before. They might even occasionally allow a dip once and a while...  but they'd never permit the exchange rate to fall too low...
...the best part would be the fact that it would be to every other exchange's advantage to perpetuate the idea...

1. People could lose interest in fiat cash or gold, too. It's a risk with any currency that holds no inherent value (or its inherent value is lower than its value as a currency (see: gold)).
2. True, but this may not be a negative (I think it is, but not everyone does).
3. As with almost any high-risk, high-return commodity.
4. Of course they could. Governments tax fiat transactions; is that not a "negative" for fiat currencies as well? This danger is not exclusive to bitcoin.
5. This is the same as 4, really.
6. Someone could dump a bunch of gold into the market, too, potentially shocking the market. Do you think it would recover?

Do you give 'em your passport, drivers' license, and a utility bill? Because that's basically what you're doing if you give your info to any bitcoin exchange. There is zero government oversight here.
Realistically, though, the market is probably just trying to cover its own ass. It's probably not remotely interested in trying to assume your identity or do anything nefarious with your information.
It's just a choice you'll hafta make for yourself.

I'm sorry; I don't mean to be insulting... but I don't think you do--or, you understand how such attacks work, but don't understand the "level" at which they occur (not sure how to word this).
If a computer has an IP address, it can be DDoSed. There is no way around it. There is no "captcha code" system that can prevent it. There is no "authorized IPs only" system that can prevent it. There is no "filter" that can prevent it. If it's on the internet, it is a potential DDoS target--that's all there is to it.
The most massive, successful companies in the world can still be successfully DDoSed. *Reddit* was being DDoSed the other day. Many other major exchanges are regularly DDoSed. Hell, *Google* has been DDoSed in the past. Do you really believe that a relatively tiny exchange for an experimental cryptocurrency could do better than the "big dogs"? Do you really think that those "big dogs" haven't considered all sorts of ingenious ways to prevent DDoS attacks? Obviously, they still don't work very well. The only way to fight DDoS attacks are with appallingly expensive, massively powerful servers--and many of them--with the ability to process the amount of requests sent by DDoS attackers.

They're in complete control of everything that we see on the website. They have access to money and, quite possibly, a great deal of bitcoin. They could easily use any of those three methods to do this.


They'll pay a higher price than other traders will. If the price seems to be "stuck" at $199 (say, there's a "wall" developing), they can initiate a single trade--perhaps for a relatively *tiny* amount of bitcoin* at a higher price (1 bitcoin for $202)--and suddenly, the "wall" is broken. Every other trader sees that the last price was $202 and thinks "Sweet; I can sell bitcoin for over $200," and every buyer sees it and thinks "Fuck, it's already over $200; I'd better buy now! It'll probably be at $250 by tomorrow!"
This "rigged trade" would cost Mt.Gox almost nothing--assume for a sec that they owned both the buying and selling account; then it truly would cost them *nothing*--yet it would instantly raise the rate for thousands of buyers and sellers. Even if they *didn't* own both accounts; say they owned the buying account, but *not* the selling account, and just paid some lucky seller $3.00 more than the current market rate... they would have spent $3.00. $3.00 to break the "wall" at $200. $3.00 to change the rate for every other investor from that point forward.
So, to answer your question, it *wouldn't* change the market any more than any other traders could--except that they would be doing things that no other traders would do...  such as pay $3.00 more than the current market rate. It only takes a tiny snowball to start an avalanche. Markets are odd beasts, very susceptible to irrational human impulses and behaviours.


What do you mean by "get something completely different?"
When I buy from Mt.Gox, I generally buy at below the market rate--it makes sense. There are usually some people willing to sell at a lower rate. My orders don't go through immediately, but there's a "sweet spot" that can usually be hit, resulting in a complete buy at a slightly lower rate.
The exchange rate isn't something that's set in stone; it's quite possible to play the markets a little. However, Mt.Gox is the one who's setting the exchange rate. If you want your order to go through immediately, you have to accept their rate. This is an *incredibly* powerful tool they've got at their disposal... and they've got no reason *not* to misuse it (maybe just a little). If they're careful, almost everyone can benefit! They can manipulate the market right up to a level that makes bitcoin a viable, powerful, and truly useful currency... and if they do it right, they can do it without crashing the market at all...

Well, first, you must understand that the production of bitcoin is based on a mathematical formula. This formula is designed to make it difficult to produce bitcoin. The difficulty increases over time, and has a maximum cap. So, only a certain amount of bitcoin can ever be produced profitably. Bitcoin is a finite resource; it has been mathematically designed to be such.
Second, there are two other players in this scenario: exchanges and merchants.
"Exchanges" are organizations like Mt.Gox. They change local currencies, like American dollars or Euros or Japanese yen, into bitcoins for a small fee. They respond to market pressures, but they can also manipulate the market, if they are powerful enough.
"Merchants" are people like me. We are willing to trust bitcoin as a currency. We invest in bitcoin by offering goods and services in exchange for it. Now, it is currently very difficult for merchants. People don't want to spend bitcoin. Its value is increasing too quickly. So, they think, if they spend it, then they are wasting money.
I believe that bitcoin needs honest exchanges AND merchants in order to survive. Now, bitcoin is being subjected to unfortunate speculation. It may be that bitcoin are worth a lot, but speculators are causing dangerous deflation.
This is all my opinion. My opinion is biased, because I am a bitcoin merchant. However, I truly believe that merchants like me, along with the cooperation of legitimately self-interested exchanges, will determine whether bitcoin succeeds or fails as an online currency.

You gotta understand, the commands that a DDoS attack uses are incredibly simple--"handshake" packets.
Forgive me if I'm being patronizing; it's not my intent: when your computer makes contact with a server, there are very, very basic packets that are exchanged; something along the lines of
"I'm using TCP/IP"
"So am I"
"I'm computer B, and I'm looking for server X"
"I'm server X"
"Cool; I have a password for you"
You get the idea.
Now, imagine a billion computers contacting that server and saying "hey" "hey" "hey" "hey" "hey" "hey" over and over again. That's kinda what a DDoS attack is. This isn't a complex attack; it's an incredibly simple one. The server has no choice but to respond, because it has to respond to *any* request--long before it determines any real info about the request.
Lots o' folks have trouble wrapping their heads around this sort of attack; it doesn't make sense. Why not just block the attackers? Why not require some passcode? Why not do XXXXX?  Because before any of those things can be done, very simple, small amounts of information have to be exchanged--and it's those small bits of information that are utilized by DDoS attacks.

You're dealing with amateurs who don't know anything about trading who had come into bitcoin with eyes glazed over with dreams of becoming a millionaire overnight, people who mortgaged their house, sold their cars, and sunk their savings into Mt.Gox at $250, convinced that bitcoin would be worth $1000 before summer.
Upon seeing their investment immediately lose over half its value, I have no doubt that some of them fiat-cashed out, cementing their losses forever. However, I'm sure that a great many of them hung on, telling themselves (*possibly* correctly) that this was temporary and that bitcoin would rise again. They would yet see a profit--and an unimaginable one at that!  They just needed to hang on a little longer...
...and, yeah, I predict that once they realize they can save their initial investment, they'll decide it's better to be safe than sorry and yank that shit out... and since they'll probably be worried everyone else is gonna do the same thing, they'll do it a little early, taking a small loss...
So, yeah. I'm just talking out my arse like everyone else, but I think that if we see $200, it will be followed by another crash (probably less severe than the last one, though).
As a merchant, I don't give a crap. I'm hoping for stability above all else. Slow, stable growth I can handle; it's a good thing. Ridiculous hypergrowth? Not so much...

This is a pretty common method of "correcting" English Language Learners; the instructor's goal is to help the speaker or write feel confident that he or she has a good grasp of the language and grammar, but merely made a few small mistakes.
Once the speaker or writer has gained a near-native level of fluency, the instructor may begin to encourage the learner to use more appropriately-structured sentences.

You'll need to consider how long it will take before the miner is actually delivered. You'll be pretty far down the waiting list.
It's a risky investment; you'll have to decide for yourself if bitcoin will rise in value enough to justify the expense.
At this point, if I were you, I'd probably just hang on to the coin. Still, I'm not much of a gambler, and if I'd been smarter, I would've bought a lot more bitcoin in the beginning, when they were almost worthless.

I'm actually still getting sales, but I'm a fringe business offering rare exports of a very specific variety. My products hold their value *extremely* well (case in point--over half my inventory consists of used products).
My point is that *normal* businesses should be able to do business with bitcoin if the currency hopes to survive long-term. At the moment, nobody wants to buy a video card with bitcoin because their bitcoin will be worth 10% more tomorrow.
Look, don't put words in my mouth. I'm not telling people that they're "harming the economy" because they're not buying things--I'm telling the bitcoin community as a whole that speculation is capable of killing bitcoin. Honestly, I'm not sure that there is a solution; I'm just hoping that bitcoin either levels off or that the "bubble pops" soon, because I don't see this sort of growth ending well for anyone.
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:38:48
Well, they're not correct, but the bitcoin market economy is seriously suffering right now. Almost nobody is spending bitcoin--and why should they? It might be worth 10% (or 20%, or 40%, or even 150%) more tomorrow.
I'm a bitcoin-only merchant, and I can assure you that this bubble is clobbering the bitcoin market. The bitcoin exchange rate needs to stabilize (or crash) before people are gonna start spending. Many businesses can't afford to wait, and will close or--far worse for bitcoin--use another cryptocurrency of some kind (say, litecoin).

Hmm.

Individuals who have studied English as a second language generally struggle with a variety of difficulties, but hetergraph confusion is not among them...

No, no; you misunderstand. I agree! However, bitcoin can *behave* more like a commodity than a currency, and when it does so, its market suffers.
Personally, I think it can survive this period of volatility, but I think it's foolish to dismiss the market. Bitcoin *needs* its market and merchants--every currency does.

@_date: 2013-04-01 04:02:20


The author goes on about this for a while. It is true (essentially) that bitcoin possesses irreversible entropy (everything does, after all).
However, bitcoin is also, essentially, infinitely divisible (currently, the divisibility is limited to X decimal places, but this could be altered in the future). This simple characteristic makes it relatively immune to complete destruction due to entropy.


Actually, gold *does* have (essentially) irreversible entropy, just as bitcoin--the author just brought it up himself. Oddly, the author seems to believe that only gold in the shape of a coin is valuable as currency. Gold bars that sink to the bottom of the Mariana Trench are essentially lost forever (maybe not, but it's unlikely that anyone will be retrieving them any time soon). Gold fillings that are buried with the deceased are lost forever (barring grave-robbers or Nazis or the like). Gold that has been used in integrated circuits and buried in landfills or irradiated is lost forever (or, until such a time as a cost-benefit analysis reveals that their recovery might be worthwhile).
Likewise, bitcoin might prove just as "recoverable." In fifty years, when bitcoin are trading at $5000, someone might come in and say "Hey man, fifty-three years ago, I had four-hundred bitcoin on this hard drive. It suffered a severe head crash, and I lost all the data. I didn't care at the time, 'cause they were pretty much worthless, but now it might be worth the cost of recovering 'em..."
...and it just might actually be!
Entropy in and of itself is not a reason to reject a currency--if it were, we might as well reject the entire universe.


This argument is nonsensical. The government has the responsibility to withdraw currency to stave off the effects of inflation? They're the ones that created the inflation in the first place.
What the author is really doing here is advocating a strong central bank. The author approves of strict government oversight of funds and a strong central banking authority with the power to create and regulate funds. That's fine; that's the author's opinion and he is entitled to it. I suspect many people might agree with him.
I, however, do not. I suspect a great many other folks who are enthusiastic about the concept of bitcoin do not agree, either. In fact, it is the appalling behavior of strong central banking authorities that first stimulated the creation of bitcoin in the first place.
This may be the only argument that is actually somewhat logical in this entire article, however, so I must give the author some credit for it. He obviously believes that a central banking authority is superior to bitcoin's freedom. I am forced to wonder, however, if he would feel the same way if he'd had his life savings stored in a Cyprus bank.


And yet, only moments before, the author attempted to argue that because we have hackers, scammers, and counterfeiters, we shouldn't use bitcoin.


Gold is always at risk of becoming worthless as a currency, too (if you're starving to death, as is everyone around you, gold is useless if your hungry neighbor happens to catch a chicken (well, if you've got enough, I suppose you could bean him over the head with it)). ANY currency is as risk for becoming worthless (Weinmar? Zimbabwe?). This is hardly an effective argument against bitcoin.


Here we see an important view of the author: he believes that issuing a currency is a **privilege** bestowed on a sovereign entity (by who, themselves?) "in the hope of solving the underlying problem" (what problem?). 
I disagree. I believe that the **right** to issue currency is one granted by the **people** (that is, after all, one of the purposes of the US Constitution). It is within the **people's** rights to use another currency, if they choose. This right holds legal precedent according to the SCOTUS, as well. The people are free to use any currency they choose--dollars, gold, bitcoin, or jellybeans.

You'll spend significantly more in electricity costs than you'll generate by mining bitcoin. Don't bother mining; it would make much more sense to buy bitcoin than mine it. Lots of info about this.
Safest way to store bitcoin is probably in your own, backed-up wallet.

Volatility sucks. I've been preaching this for a while, but you can't stop speculation, no matter how much it damages the fundamentals of the bitcoin economy.
I can stay in business because my products are relatively rare. I don't generally adjust my prices much and try to just ride bubbles out. I can afford to--many merchants can't.

Probably something we'll have to live with... and that's okay. That's how markets work. That's how precious metals, stocks, bonds, and all that sorta stuff works.
Trading freedom for stability...  is it really something you want to do? If so... bitcoin may not be the place for you--and that's okay! Fiat currencies are far, far more stable than bitcoin. Generally controlled by central banks, with their values being established through diplomatic channels and back-room deals, they are, historically, virtually rock-solid... though they invariably tend to lose their value over time.

I absolutely agree with your assessment, and it's good to see people examining the emotions behind bitcoin with a critical eye.
I actually think that both views are probably true--that bitcoin's current rise is a bubble, but that, as a currency, it will hold its value well enough to remain functional for some time.
I think that speculators are currently hurting bitcoin; this rate of growth is dangerous in my humble and insignificant opinion. However, I'm also comfortable enough with bitcoin to do business with it, so I obviously think the naysayers are wrong, too.
I'm probably overlooking some obvious flaw in my critical thinking on the subject, though.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:03:29


Yeah; that was me trying to explain why this wouldn't work for bitcoin, either.
Can't you understand why this works the same way? If mining were easy, everyone would be able to get bitcoin easily, and bitcoin would be worthless.
Mining is hard right now because bitcoin is valuable--and the reverse is true as well--bitcoin is valuable now because mining is difficult.
In the early days, mining was easy; anyone could do it with a regular ol' CPU miner and get a buttload of coins--but they were all but worthless at the time. Nowadays, they're worth a lot--and mining is expensive and difficult to get into.
I dunno how to explain this any better, man.

What is your definition of "offshore", exactly? Mt.Gox is based in Japan. Most exchanges don't really have to worry about current money-laundering laws, anyway, since trade in bitcoin is (currently) relatively unregulated.

They've both got their advantages and disadvantages.
If nothing else, with bitcoin, you have the ability to send it instantly and securely to anyone in the world, so if you've got someone across the world that you trust completely, you could send everything to them and there'd be nothing anyone could do (they could throw you in prison or torture you or something, but it wouldn't get them any money).

You just have to be careful, be willing to risk losing a little money once and a while, and have a little faith. All of these things are requirements for pretty much any business venture.
At the moment, the big driver for bitcoin sales is extremely strong demand, which is why stuff that's illegal is still selling and stuff that can be bought with a more stable currency isn't. Basically, I'd say that unless you have access to a market with a pretty strong demand, it's probably a good idea to hold off on sinking a lot of capital into a bitcoin-based business.

They raise some good points, but, ultimately, it doesn't matter. Even if it turns out that Mt.Gox is manipulating the ever-living shit out of the bitcoin market (and I would not be the least bit surprised), the market can and almost certainly will survive.
Mt.Gox has a huge incentive to manipulate the exchange rate, very little incentive *not* to, and no laws preventing them from doing so. Why shouldn't they? Worst case scenario: it all comes crashing down and they shut down the site before anyone can sell bitcoin. They walk away with boatloads of fiat cash--because their liability is limited to about $50,000 (according to Japanese corporate law). I'll applaud them.
Full disclosure: I have bitcoin, am a bitcoin-only merchant, and do business with Mt.Gox. Why would I willingly bash them? Because it's just as much to their advantage to ride this thing out and ultimately legitimize themselves.

Most amateur filmmakers suck.
I intend no offense to you personally, but I've known a great many amateur filmmakers, even been involved in an full-length film (and had a blast making it with the folks involved), and I can tell you that the biggest problem with the vast majority of 'em (and pretty much every other artist or entrepreneur on the planet) is that they've taken pains to avoid hearing things they don't want to hear.
Your film is probably bad. Your previous films have probably been bad. If they were good, you'd probably have been able to get funds from *someone*.
The film I was involved in was mediocre, won a few awards at national film shows, and was financed entirely by the directors, actors, and techs--and nearly broke all of 'em, resulted in a divorce, and ultimately was the last film the directors ever made.

A quick look on r/Bitcoin's front page reveals BBC, CNBC, and Yahoo! Finance reporting on bitcoin.
The same page reveals that one can buy beer, a hostel ticket, real estate, porn, and sushi with bitcoin, and suggests that Western Union may soon accept it as a currency.
Bubbles are cyclic. It may be that bitcoin will enjoy a long-term ("mean") rise in value, and, if so, the long-term investors will reap the rewards.
However, I do believe that we are *currently* in a bubble, that it resembles the chart seen here, and that we are pretty far along. Can anyone really deny that there's a *lot* of hype surrounding bitcoin right now?
Yeah, currently bitcoin clients are like Netscape Navigator. Remember what happened to Netscape Navigator? It got all bloated and shitty, eventually suffering an inglorious death.

Sure, but the DDoS attacker could always attack your firewall. If you have a gate connected to the internet, it can be DDoSed.
Think about it in physical terms: imagine you have a locked gate. You keep your goods inside. You've given all your customers a key. The only problem is, the customer can't use his key while someone else' key is in the lock. DDoS would be like a hundred dudes standing outside the gate putting the wrong key in over and over again.
Scale it up a bit, and you have some idea of what happens with a DDoS attack. Imagine thousands of gates, with thousands of locks, but with millions of dudes standing out in front of them putting the wrong key in over and over again.
This is why DDoS attacks are so successful, and why nobody can really do anything about them when they happen: you hafta have the gate. You hafta have the lock and key. You hafta make 'em available to anyone walking down the road, 'cause that's where your customers are gonna come from.
No way around it, really.

Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme because it is completely transparent. It is not any more of a ponzi scheme than gold.
Is gold a ponzi scheme? Outside of its use as an industrial metal, it has little value (and as an industrial metal, it is not worth nearly as much as it is perceived to be as a currency). You can't eat it. People who invested in gold years ago ('49ers who went to California and pulled it out of muddy rivers) stood to benefit far more than folks who got into the game later. They were able to get their gold so easily. Today, companies have to mine gold using expensive equipment. How is that fair? It must be a ponzi scheme!
See, it works exactly the same way. Bitcoin was (is) a high-risk, high-return investment. If bitcoin failed (it still might), then the investors would have made a poor choice. If bitcoin takes off (it seems to be, currently), then the investors made a wise choice, and deserve their return.
Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme because it doesn't fit the definition. Later investors are not having their funds used to "pay off" early investors--many early investors believe in bitcoin as a currency and aren't especially concerned with the exchange rate.

@_date: 2013-04-04 06:20:43
Aww, you deleted it?
Cool, cool; fair enough.
5, revisited: You're right. Those in power will try to retain their power. I think that this is more of an advantage of bitcoin, though. Bitcoin can't be easily confiscated. I can safely and securely (and very nearly instantly) send a buttload of bitcoin to an overseas friend if I have to--and vice versa. Those in power might not like bitcoin because bitcoin has the potential to remove some of that power. To me, though, this is not a negative, any more than, say, owning a car is a negative.
6: I guess that's the rub when it comes to bitcoin: the market is smaller and very new. Would it recover? Who knows... it's a gamble. I have more dollars than I have btc (given recent history, this has been rather foolish of me).
7: I think it is currently behaving more like a commodity than a currency, and I do believe its in a bubble (although I believe that, long term, it will be more valuable than it is today). As a bitcoin-only merchant, I can tell you that not many people are spending bitcoin these days. I see bitcoin as a commodity currently because that seems to be how most other people see it. I would *rather* see people treat it as a currency--something I think will happen once this bubble either pops or levels off.
9: I don't disagree, though I am kinda hoping that BTC manages to hold on to the throne.
10: Is it? When I got started with bitcoin, I invested a grand total of around $120. Could I really get started with stocks or mutual funds with $120? To the novice (and I certainly am), stocks and mutual funds and shit like that seems head and shoulders above bitcoin when it comes to obfuscation and elitist knowledge.

It's really difficult to take your post seriously when you mix up "their" and "there".
The USD is not going to "crash" anytime soon. While I have little faith in the USD in the long term, I am very realistic about the market response to its fluctuations. Realistically speaking, the USD is probably a "safer" investment than bitcoin. With bitcoin, you're taking a gamble--maybe a smart one, but a gamble, nevertheless.
If you're basing your investment strategy on the hopes that the US dollar will collapse, you're probably in for some disappointment. The USD will not "collapse," the US govt. will not "default;" at best the US will attempt to "inflate" its way out of trouble.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:36:30


Actually, my business is doing quite well. I just think it would be doing a lot better if bitcoin stabilized.


You can't be serious. The difference seems glaringly obvious. Look at it from the spender's point of view, rather than the merchant's.


You don't understand much about business. It's pretty difficult to be "comfortable" when people are unwilling to spend currency. What's the solution for a business that has goods for which there is a demand, but for which the demand is not high enough to justify spending a currency? Well, switch currencies. Different currency = not good for bitcoin.


You seem to be treating my comments as some sort of personal lament about my business, and using it as a springboard to insult my business management skills.
Let me make this clear: my business is rocking. Seriously; I am banking on this bitcoin shit. The products I sell are rare, in demand, and about as recession- and even deflation-proof as they come.
BUT... not all businesses are so lucky.
If bitcoin becomes a speculation-only market, it will die. It will be as all the nay-sayers claim--it's "tulips"; it's "beanie babies"; it's worthless. Why? Because merchants depend on the willingness of customers to spend a currency--and they don't give a flying fuck which currency they're using, so long as it lets them do the business they want to do.
This is economics 101 stuff, man. A little deflation is fine--severe, parabolic deflation can kill a currency if it goes on for too long.
So, dude, if you're just trying to tell me that I'm a shitty business manager--LOL. If you're trying to argue that parabolic deflation can continue indefinitely without damaging the market--well, that's your opinion, and I disagree.

"What, if any, would be the effect(s) upon bitcoin (as a viable currency) if every person in possession of a bitcoin wallet were to lose, delete, or otherwise destroy said wallets? Would the bitcoin contained in said wallets be lost forever?"
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:43:45
Severe deflation causes hoarding behavior--why spend your currency if your currency will be worth significantly more tomorrow? Hoarding behavior can result in a collapse of an economy: businesses are unable to find customers willing to spend a severely deflating currency, so they start accepting a different currency--and, if it's not worth the effort, drop the first currency. Suddenly, hoarders realize that their currency can't buy very much stuff, and they start to drop it. A panic ensues. Crash.
This is one of the reasons why so many people have compared bitcoin to tulips and beanie babies--the economics behind them have been similar in the past.
Personally, I believe in bitcoin more than this; I think, unlike tulips or beanie babies, bitcoin can and should function more as a currency than a commodity. Currently, speculators are treating it as a commodity. I'm hoping for a stabilization (or, yes, even a crash) so that it starts behaving more as a currency.
I'm not advocating for any sort of solution; I'm not saying that speculators need to be beaten or screamed at; I'm not saying that bitcoin needs to change by implementing X; I'm not even saying that I hate speculators--I'm just saying that severe, parabolic deflation can damage an economy badly, and that I hope such deflation doesn't continue.

Hey man; I'm right there with ya. I'm a bitcoin-only merchant--not looking to get rich from speculating; for me, bitcoin is useful as a currency that (1) can't be charged back, so no worry of scammers, (2) can't be seized by government officials (a la Cyprus), (3) can be very nearly instantly transferred with minimal fees, even internationally, with no worries about exchange rates or any of that malarkey, and (4) is totally cool.
I didn't mind the market mayhem today; for me, as a merchant, market corrections are useful, because they help stabilize the currency in the long run and make people a bit more willing to spend (vs. a hyper-deflation bubble situation).

The other exchanges can be lower because they have significantly less volume. It's difficult--if not impossible--for customers to transfer fiat-cash to other exchanges quickly.

This is kinda cool, but not *that* cool. A massive increase in bitcoin sales = selling off bitcoin.

I use both TOR and Freenet--they're cool, but their methods are almost certainly impractical for an exchange. People get mad about a few seconds of lag on Mt.Gox. Obviously Freenet is out. TOR is a little better, but lag/access speeds largely depend on the exit node, and will invariably be longer than a few seconds--think tens of seconds, particularly if many people are attempting to access the server.
What you're proposing might be possible, but it would not be practical, it would be extremely complicated for the uninitiated (and just look at how many people are complaining about bitcoin being "inaccessible"), it would possibly result in *increased* lag, and it runs the risk of TOR exit nodes being targeted by DDoSers.
If such a system would *were* practical, someone would have implemented it by now.

Speculation and greed, primarily. Nobody is buying anything (legal). Have you been to bitmit lately? Zero bids on anything. Why would anyone in their right mind *want* to spend bitcoin on anything (legal) right now? Your bitcoin will be worth 10% more tomorrow, if today's pattern holds up.

Let's look at the last part of what they said:


There is absolutely nothing false about that statement. The author--while admittedly quite biased--is making a reasonable statement that is quite defensible, logically speaking.


Is this bad advice? I would think that anyone who says something to the effect of "be careful" is offering pretty sound advice.




Except that every other exchange stands to benefit from perpetuating the *slightly* manipulated exchange rate; every exchange stands to lose as much--if not more--than Mt.Gox in the event of a severe sell-off, and every exchange charges enough in fees to prevent someone from playing the exchanges for significant profit.
Sorry, but I think you're wrong.
Again, I'm saying this as a loyal customer of Mt.Gox. I am very appreciative of the job they're doing, don't care if they're manipulating the market a little, and sincerely hope for the best for them and every other bitcoin enthusiast--including myself.


Yeah, I really would. I think bitcoin would survive and would probably even benefit--in the long term--from an event like that.
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:45:57
To a point, this is true...
However, consider the fact that so long as bitcoin are in demand (that is, more people are *buying* bitcoin than *selling* bitcoin), an exchange could theoretically raise the exchange rate as much as they liked. The sellers would be happy--they're making money! The buyers would be happy--look at how much the value is rising! The exchange would be happy--with just a little manipulation, the exchange rate is exploding, and who's gaining the most? Why, they are, of course!
An especially powerful exchange could get away with this for quite some time; they wouldn't face any real trouble unless the value suddenly began to plummet. Other exchanges would benefit from perpetuating this deception. I hesitate to use the word "deception" there, because it's almost nothing of the sort.
In considering all this, it's important to keep in mind the fact that because Mt.Gox is located in Japan and is, therefor, subject to Japan's corporate laws, the absolute maximum corporate liability is the amount declared...  which, according to their corporate website, is right around $50,000.
If they go down, that's all they'll be liable for. Period.

I am a bitcoin-only merchant. I exchange most of my bitcoin to the local currency in order to maintain my inventory. I keep a small bitcoin balance that is slowly growing, but also sell quite a bit of it.
The explosion in value recently has made it very difficult to price my exports, and made it even more difficult to sell them. Other merchants are suffering similarly. Take a look at Bitmit. Very few products are receiving bids. Nobody wants to spend bitcoin, because the perceived value is growing so quickly. Why spend today when your bitcoin will be worth five or even ten percent more tomorrow?
This is eventually going to kill the market and, ultimately, the value of bitcoin--at least, temporarily. I, for one, am sincerely hopeful that this bubble will pop soon. I believe in the LONG-TERM potential of bitcoin, and that means I'm waiting for exchange stability so that I can do effective business with my customers.

It's because you're trying to force the value of bitcoin to rest on a certain fiat currency. The US dollar is falling in value constantly.

Just look at China, or any other nation that pegged its currency against the dollar for any length of time.

It's important to me to see how enthusiasts respond to detractors.
That was a big part of the reason I embraced bitcoin for my business exports--a sizable percentage of enthusiasts came off as loony anti-government types, or out-of-touch evangalists... but an even larger percentage proved to be reasonable, logical folks who had examined bitcoin, found it to be promising--though a bit chancy--and decided to invest, and, in general, capable of responding intelligently to reasonable questions and logical dissent.

Bitcoin was being valued more highly than it should have been. It suffered from speculation resulting in severe volatility. Hoards of folks seeking to make a quick buck stuffed their money into it, then panicked and tried to pull it out again when they realized it might not make them millionaires overnight--it might actually *cost* them money.
Merchants were suffering severely--they were unable to accurately price their goods and services without using a script/depending on a gateway, and they found it difficult to attract customers for all but the most desirable or time-restricted goods. The merchants are far more important than the speculators would lead you to believe--they help determine the true value of bitcoin, not just the exchanges and speculators.
There were a wide variety of factors that led to the drop. I believe it may drop farther. I am hopeful, however, that this shall ultimately prove to be a useful and valuable market correction, helping to establish bitcoin as a viable cryptocurrency for use by all.

While I can sympathize with the excited frenzy in which one might find oneself in the heat of a market bubble...  you gotta keep your head, man.

There probably is *some* sneaky business going on, but as the bitcoin market becomes more accepted, it makes more sense for the exchange to build trust. The more people trust 'em, the more they'll exchange with 'em, and the more profit the exchange will make.
I would say that there was probably a lot of shady shit going on in the early days, but there's probably a bit less nowadays.
That said, if I understand Japan's corporate laws (and they're complex as fuck, so don't take my word for anything), a corporation's maximum liability is defined by its stated capital. Mt.Gox's capital is listed as five million yen (a decent chunk over $50,000). That's all they're liable for. If the bitcoin market collapses completely, they're only liable for $50,000 (again, that's if I'm understanding Japanese corporate law correctly). Japan tends to heavily favor businesses over individuals in court disputes as well; suing a business is virtually unheard of here.
Potential investors might wanna keep that in mind before sinking millions into 'em....

Eh, it worked well for almost an entire year. I can handle the occasional bubble. My worry is that a lot of businesses cannot. If the merchants can't survive, bitcoin won't survive.
I *do* turn over BTC relatively quickly--I *have* to, in order to maintain my inventory. I also keep a small (but growing) stash of BTC, I keep a little in two different fiats, and I'm looking at diversifying a little more even.
I *do* sometimes lock my prices to protect myself, but I generally try to avoid it. Since I get more customers who don't know anything about bitcoin than otherwise, I run an odd sort of private Paypal exchange, then offer discounts on my merchandise for exchanging fiat cash through it. It's a little work, but it actually all works out pretty well. This also lets me "dampen" the speculation-driven spikes, to an extent.

Please accept my most sincere apologies. I didn't mean to start a pissing contest. It's all too easy to make silly mistakes when one has been living in a foreign country for over five years. I miss English sometimes.

Was it the Mexican drug cartels? Maybe it was another bank that was doing it for Iran. I forget; it seems like every day, one can read stories about some big bank being caught doing some horrific thing or another.
I agree about Iran, but the law is the law. For example, I also think that marijuana should be decriminalized, as should prostitution...  but the law is the law. You were talking about good things being mitigated by the potential for use by criminals. Violating a law of *any* kind makes one a criminal. It doesn't matter how you or I feel about Iran.

I'm sorry; I don't understand the question. Are you asking what circumstances would have to exist in order for me to stop accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:38:58
 is probably more likely. I don't care; I'm a bitcoin merchant and would vastly prefer slow, stable growth over this volatile bubbling behavior.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:16:16
I wasn't. I was using banks laundering money to them as an example of violation of the law.
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:30:02
Certainly significantly better than downvoting anything that dampens the spirits of greedy speculators.

No. Ripple is closed-source, pre-mined, and, to me, increasingly has the distinct feel of a scam.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:51:20
No worries, man. Do what makes ya feel comfortable, and feel good about the profit you pulled! Better yet, why not spend a little bitcoin at a bitcoin merchant's shop? Give something back to the community that helped you earn that profit!

Disappear forever, just like the gold you buried in the mountains.
Leave someone the necessary info in your will or something.

Either they don't *have* bitcoin (hopefully because they've got their capital sunk in R&amp;D and production), or they think that the bitcoin are or will be more valuable than whatever currency they send you via Paypal.
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:01:01
Yeah; it's all right if you're into gambling, and the odds are pretty good, but the real winner is the house, of course; they always win--especially when the thing gets reset.
I expect boatloads of copycat schemes in a fairly short time.
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:21:00
Yep, it's gone forever.
This is referred to as "entropy" by some. It is not a characteristic unique to bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency--gold, for example, also possesses entropy. This is *not* a characteristic possessed by fiat currencies such as the US dollar--more money can simply be printed.
This is one of the aspects of bitcoin that makes it valuable--it's finite (like gold). Some view this as a disadvantage of bitcoin; others do not.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:37:34
Uh-uh. Not gonna offer you any kind of financial advice; that's on you. I have no idea what the future of the bitcoin market looks like--nor does anyone else!
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:55:51
Yeah; as a merchant, I find myself in the odd position of hoping for a stabilization, correction, or even a crash--a position that puts me at odds with vast masses of invested speculators. Still, I think it would be good for the currency to experience a bit of a calming-down.
Realistically, though, I'm not sure it'll be happening soon.
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:26:50
The problem becomes the fee: it's got to be big enough that a potential attacker won't pay it but small enough that your potential customers won't mind paying it. That's a tricky line to find--and if you're successful, the amount that an attacker is willing to pay to locate your server increases.
I dunno, man; if you think you can do this, go for it. I'm just sayin', it's gonna be nearly impossible to completely avoid DDoS attacks. That's why they're so successful.

Well, Mt.Gox is good for *me* because I live in Japan. They can take a direct bank transfer--called a "furikomi" here--and have it in your account crazy fast.
I have no idea what they've got set up in the 'States.
I wasn't in a hurry when I set up and verified my account--that was before bitcoin really blew up--so, as I recall, I sent 'em some money and bought bitcoin the next day.
LOL If only I'd bought more back then. How was I supposed to know this was gonna happen? It was more of a gimmick for me at the time...

I wouldn't try mining unless you (1) have free electricity, (2) already have or can easily get  *really* spectacular mining rig, and (3) have no other way to get bitcoin.
If you can just keep putting aside a small amount of your disposable income and use it to buy bitcoin, this is probably your best bet--*if* you believe in the long-term potential of bitcoin. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
If you have some service, skill, or good you can offer for bitcoin, try to market yourself!
Don't beat yourself up for failing to buy more back in the day. We're all doing that--even those of us who bought a bunch!
Above all, please don't look at bitcoin as a "get rich" strategy. It *may* work out that way... or it may collapse completely as a currency. Bitcoin has risen and fallen. Consider your investment as a potential long-term thing that may (or may not) work out very well for you.
I know it's hard not to be excited... but don't let that excitement screw with your better judgement!
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:27:36
Yes, but prepare for downvotes from investors. Lots of investors don't believe an active market is necessary for bitcoin to maintain its value. They're right--in the short term. It's important to keep in mind, however, that many investors don't care about the long-term future of bitcoin; many of them believe it's experiencing a bubble and they're hoping to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:49:36
I mean, c'mon; we're well past "media attention," obviously.

Dear Bitcoinbillionaire
Please don't listen to Jessica_Shure. I know her. She will spend your money on pornography, hard liquor, and meth.
You should send it to me, instead. I'll probably spend it on the same things, but at least I'm not lying to you about it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:02:06
That might be true, but in my line of business, I tend to get a lot more folks showing up saying, "I wanna buy your shit, but wtf is bitcoin?" Far more of that than folks showing up saying "I found your shit 'cause of bitcoin."
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:02:33
Why would they refund your money? You signed up to buy an un-proven product from an non-transparent, un-regulated company with no guaranteed delivery date of any kind in the hope of making an un-known amount of new currency with an as-yet un-determined value...
You gambled with your money, and it's pretty unlikely that you'll get it back. BL has little incentive to offer it back. If they do, it will be because they're more interested in keeping *potential* customers enthusiastic--that is, the opportunity cost of *not* returning your money outweighs the gain of keeping it. You *might* get it back. Good luck; I sincerely wish you the best and hope ya get your cash back!
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:09:18


Really? Dude. "All those bitcoins" amount to, what...  sixty bucks? C'mon, man. I'm dirt-fucking poor, and even I can see the folly of being that invested in sixty bucks. If you depended on that sixty bucks so much, then wtf were you doing investing them in bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:25:24
I *do* understand. That's why I don't care much for speculators, and have pretty much constantly warned folks here and elsewhere that merchants are far, far more important to the bitcoin economy than are speculators, that they were hurting, and that it was a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:51:39
Yeah. Thanks for being the biggest, the best, and the first.
C'mon, OP. Mt.Gox is not responsible for this; the bitcoin community is.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:39:39
Have an upvote from a bitcoin merchant! Hoping for a stabilization myself!
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:08:12
Not like HSBC was recently caught and fined for laundering money for Iran or anything...
