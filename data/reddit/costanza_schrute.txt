It's not that ppl don't know that they can buy a fraction of a coin. It's that in order to get x2 gain, BTC needs to get to $34k, meanwhile alts show ridiculous gains that are greater than BTC.

I've been thinking of getting one of these. But then I read that it relies on a google chrome plugin to send transactions... how safe can it really be?

misleading title, should say: "The New York Stock Exchange is getting into Bitcoin futures, pending approval"

Bitcoin is not the only thing you can invest in. 
Look at nVidia.

I'm not concerned with the BTC price dropping, but I'm, once again, disappointed of not predicting the BCH pump or even the alts pump. Smart people didn't hold BTC, but rather switched crypto and made tons of profit.

considering that 7800 lasted for like half an hour, that's quite an achievement :)

Good topic to discuss, but all I read so far is one contradiction after another. 
I think there will be a fork, but it won't last longer than the existence of incompatible blocks.

I don't see a single thing in the OP's post indicating that the S2x fork won't happen.


So both BTC and BX2 will co-exist and be traded until one of them disappears. This doesn't imply which one will win.


Seems that people are just hyped about fork and free coins. Like the BTG dev team of like 5 people, who made tons of money for themselves out of thin air.


Same as with exchanges allowing exchange of both BTC and BX2. This makes even more sense, considering that either BTC or BX2 won't disappear instantaneously after the fork.

If there's no answer on stackoverflow, then the question is irrelevant.

this is really not that big of a deal, just look past the numbers and the "psychological" barrier. The "pump" happened late on around 4.9k USD and went up to a bit above 5.2k. This is not unprecedented, just like the dips that always follow.

This is actually not very good for bitcoin. We have the Venezuela's petro, the Russian cryptorubbel and the Swedish e-krona on the way. 
And the common story appears to be that every other coin except their own-made coin is going to get banned or tightly regulated.

Why did you write "17 million" but then "4 millions" with an "s"?
