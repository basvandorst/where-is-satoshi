I heard they have to keep resetting the entire test network.  I'll just wait another ten years till its ready for beta.  My info is dated at this point so i could be wrong, but my spidey sense tells me this rocket ain't getting off the launch pad.

Her point is that if homes can only be purchased with savings, and not loans, the number of people capable of purchasing homes will be substantially reduced - so will the price of homes in your neighborhood, even if they are on the water.

You do realize that the US Marshals Service have sold tens of millions of dollars worth of 'tainted' bitcoins seized from illegal marketplaces right?
If they're allowed to sell tainted coins, I'm sure you're ok :)

This is all an experiment bro, we are figuring it out as we go.  If you have a grand master plan that addresses all these issues with proven solutions, now would be the time to tell us about it.

I get what you are saying, but I don't think you are using the term Capitalism correctly.  Capitalism is an economic system.  Bitcoin is a currency that can be used within a capitalistic system.
Definition of Capitalism 
: an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market

I have wired a lot of money in and out of Gemini.  Their wires are fast and free.
They are in the middle of replatforming so maybe wait till that settles down first.

I wired money into Gemini from my local bank branch at 11AM yesterday.  When I got back to work at 11:05AM the money was in Gemini ready to use.  
Wires in and out of Gemini are free and literally can't be any faster.

Your bitcoin address is not associated with any device.   It exists on the blockchain which is stored by thousands of computers around the world.  
Your private key exists on your wallet on your phone.  It is used to sign transactions when you spend your coins.  But an exchange doesn't know where it is and doesn't care.

* Recovery seed (same as one in home safe)
Parents home safe in another state
* Trezor PIN (memorized)

I would add that you should also spread it out over multiple exchanges.  Say you need to buy 50,000BTC, don't just buy them all on one exchange.  Instead, place buy orders for 10,000BTC on 5 different exchanges.  I had to learn that the hard way.

This could turn out to be huge for other reasons too.  They are planning to deliver some sort of client and POS systems that settle in crypto on the backend.  This would be a scalable solution that doesn't need LN or other second-layer solutions or sidechains.
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:53:38
I would say the biggest difference is that even the blatantly scam ICO's, which are a large percentage, get well-funded since anyone can invest and there are a lot of stupid people.
