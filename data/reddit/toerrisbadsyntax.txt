I'm not arguing for the case of bitcoin, that's for those people in that revolution to decide for their individual needs and purposes. 
The question I'm posing is, how well does a government death squad work under martial law, when that government's monopoly money is worth less than their toilet paper and soap?
To summarize for the layperson.  Venezuelan enfocement are no longer fit or equipped to repossess collateral and enforce law based on their governments fiscal state of affairs. 
Armies and police cost money, money needs backing and the trust that it is backed.  This is not happening in Venezuela.

To quote [Andreas Antonopolous' interview with James West...](
"recently I was watching on television in Venezuela where they had two medium-level soldiers posing for the cameras with the bounty that they were given for preserving the peace. And they had two or three rolls of toilet paper and two or three bars of soap. They’re not being bought off or bribed with luxuries; we’re already in the end stage, where the best bribe that can be given is the absolute barest essential of toilet paper and soap. How long before the government can’t even afford toilet paper? Because what they’re printing is toilet paper."
Now... That.. Is the price of "protection &amp; enforcement" in Venezuela that will be taking back all that land and collateral....

Yes exactly, however civil forfiture is a provincial matter, not a federal one! 
The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld civil forfeiture laws as a valid exercise of the provincial government power over property and civil rights.
All provinces and territories except Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island and Yukon Territory, have also enacted statutes to provide for similar civil forfeiture régimes.
There are also extenuating circumstances where asset forfiture of  virtual currencies would be outside of legal jurisdiction of the courts.

As a BMO client in canada
No, No its not
It allows for Chinese investment from their right hand, while a domestic Canadian... Closer in proximity to Montreal... Who has been banking with them for years.... Has to deal with the contradictory left hand; Won't allow me to spend my debit on crypto/BTC!
(There's already an over abundance of Chinese investment in Vancouver's and Toronto's real estate and condo market...)
Corporate disassociation doesnt look good under a single banner.
I'm not impressed
Bitcoin is banking for the unbanked or the underbanked... This pushes the idea and agenda that crypto can only be affordable to those already entrenched in the de facto banking system.
Despicable! 
Seems pretty two faced to me!
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:33:01

Wasn't BMO one of the first Canadian banks to cease online debit transactions for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:07:53
Omg.. I understand thats how HNWI money understands investing... And how banks want to do it for the client on their behalf... But.. That's not how it works! [They're going to try and make it happen](
Not your keys, not your bitcoin!
And since banks would be in effect managing their crypto portfolio for a few, either the model changes, or those banking systems and services must acquiesce.
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:04:06
Sort of right?!
I'm 110% right!
Well no, not exactly.
So if I "come in first" because I've been HODLing for some time now.. That doesn't allow me to maximize my investment thru them, I have to go somewhere else as a unvalued customer.  
However, there's nothing stopping a Chinese investor from HK buying "a little crypto thru BMO" which that one transaction could be my entire accumulation of BTC in one transaction! It doesn't really help me, it leaves me in the dust and opens the doors to those who already have skin-in-the-game with the current De facto system!
If you think like that, you'll be out of choices before you know it!
edit: my major point is, those types of exclusion tactics are harmful to the cryptospace! Crypto and banking for the time being have to co-exist until more options and services are available thru the banks.  I don't know if you noticed, but interac email transfers were a buck a piece 6 months ago... Now they're free.  
We have to promote healthy competition! Or inequities like this will expose and taint the reputation of the de facto banking system!  Co-existance is a powerful asset!
Thanks for the creative discussion and allowing me to get preachy on my soap-box!  :)

@_date: 2018-08-10 12:32:31
And that's my gripe!
These banks don't understand that telling people what they can and can't do with their money is antithetical to their business model!
 OK, I get they don't want speculative investment with their credit, creating a margin.  But most of the people buying crypto aren't classical investors - they're not buying it for the investment speculation, they're buying it for the technology and the flexibility and freedoms it presents in a digital world!
 Where in contrast the banks only play here is to do the same thing they've always done and open its doors to larger money rather than the little guy
This does not make for a balanced playing field.
This is a great example of "let the market decide!". If this arm of BMO does open an avenue to crypto, but my arm of BMO doesn't... And we all know that bitcoin and crypto are literally open technologies, then what's stopping me from going to the banks next door and asking about their policies on purchasing and investment in crypto/BTC?
open tech should be approached equally with open arms or.... The market will decide who the victor becomes.

nowhere did the individual use fiat for the sale of goods, or in this case, a gift card. Which SHOULD and WOULD be taken into consideration as store credit; nowhere did the individual use FIAT - that was agreed upon by the valuation of how the corporate body measures it's wealth transferrable through it's own "token" (gift card).  
That same "gift card" could not be used as a direct instrument of trade within ANY market, (and rightfully shouldn't be)

Bitcoin is fodder for world war 3.... Its the war for trust and peace... Everyone wants it, few know how to obtain it, even fewer know how to make/mine it and even the lucky (smart leaders in power generation industry) are able to make it cost effective...
With 80 y/o ww2 cold war tensions on the rise in the background, the trade wars and sanctions are proposed, we have cyber warfare (stuxnet) serving as another edge of the frame to balance the cold war tensions.
So, bitcoin in a way, isn't the world war.  Its not exactly a race to the bottom... That's the rich man's game for their respective nation-states.
The "war" is our race to the exit... That exit is bitcoin. That is our peace, our love, our freedom.

I stopped asking questions... that was my problem... a lack of perspective.

Crime is defined as an action against the state.
If the state unilaterally decides to impose a +&gt;%20 tax.....
then it can't be criminal, to collect a tax the state has imposed, can it?
There are two logical fallacies here.  
Either 
your numeration of the amount of taxation is arbitrarily linked to the idea of crime
governments imposing ever increasing rates of taxation in the name of X or Y is unjust
you yourself perhaps touched on the answer - maybe government has failed long before we knew.
sounds to me like the USA needs another tea party... maybe in boston perhaps?
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:15:10
interesting, but the only logical inconsistency I can see is that your "referee and rules" are applied universally, when in fact, only some of the rules are agreed upon, and usually only enforced in a single lane or neighbouring lanes.
referees from lane 2 will aid lanes 1 and 3 but are aware of but unable to interfere with the business and rules of lanes 4+ unless specifically asked by race officials who are unable to stop the race to administer judgements.
law is broken, governments are broken, and enforcement can only happen when it's observed within it's own jurisdiction.

Buffet also said "if I don't get/understand it - I stay out"
Thats some good old age sage wisdom advice!
Even with his good techno buddy billy G.  Warren STILL stayed away (probably because of his connections...) But it makes perfect sense for him to act as such.

TD is my only option to buy bitcoin online.  All other banks started disappearing as options earlier this year.  Once TD goes, my only option is buying from a bitcoin ATM in fiat...
The proof is in the pudding.

Eviction is an action of force, violence is actions by way of force. This example is from lender to debtor.  
"If a debtor can not pay the mortgage and his house is taken..."
Debtors are not owners, nothing was taken.  The debtor would be evicted - a forceable action.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:49:28

I said nothing about exchanges
I also said nothing about the gullibility of some people
I said nothing of crime
All I said is, ARENT THESE THE REASONS WHY WE MOVED TO CRYPTO.
e.g. you are your own bank... if you feel like placing your value in the hands of others such as exchanges, criminals &amp; con men, etc. That's not a problem with the TECHNOLOGY - it is sound - it is a problem with THE PEOPLE, if they cannot be responsible with crypto, or wish to operate nefariously, it's at their own behest.
you're a banking shill and it causes the demise of your industry.... so.... g'nite
god forbid that industries fall and companies dont make money because some people have to take a little more personal responsibility over their wealth.  Isn't that why jesus flipped tables and whipped tax collectors?? I dunno.. LO-fuckin-L
it aint JUST money... it's a 24/7/365 trust machine and people wont get ripped off as much..... oh noes.....Crypto forces people to THINK, play more fair &amp; it levels the playing field a bit more too.... whhaaaaa
thanks for comin' out!!
