DO NOT USE ABRA. They blatantly stole $204 from me and are ignoring all emails and inquiries about my transaction. I thought I would give Abra a try after reading some (paid for) solid reviews. I was able to do a btc transaction for a little under $100 but the whole interface and lag time and lack of real people running the app/customer service turned me off so I decided to transfer my money out of my Abra account and back into my bank. That was over two weeks ago. I have emailed everyday from briandudeydc and I get not response, nothing, silence, thieves. Do not trust this company because they are either malicious, incompetent or both. I will continue to ward off future Abra victims until I get my money back. So I'm sure I'll be at this for a while.

DO NOT USE ABRA. I deposited over $300 into an Abra account, bought btc with less than $100. Decided I didn't like the service so went to transfer $200+ back into my linked bank account. It has been over two weeks (2-3 days maximum they say for it to clear) and I have yet to get my money back. The customer service is non existent and clueless about how to write informative emails letting me know what is going on. I have sent an email every day and have received only one response. This is a really crappy company and I do not recommend using them. There are many other options out there for digital wallets and getting btc. These guys are a joke. I will continue to warn other potential Abra victims until my money is returned. What a waste of my time.
