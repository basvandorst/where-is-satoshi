How is this good news? This mtgox fiasco undermines the key concept of bit coin and chills investment and adoption. You want a deregulated and decentralized currency? Welp, this what it looks like...to the casual investor the largest exchange just folded and walked away with millions, and there's nothing anybody can do. Perhaps excising the tumor known as mtgox is a good thing, but I know it sure does look like any exchange is just a ticking time bomb. So even if btc becomes the worlds only currency, who is to say early investors won't go down with whatever fraudulent or incompetent exchange their coins are on? I hope I'm wrong, but I really can't figure out why.

As neutrally as I possibly can, I will try to give my two cents. I just want to add, providing a neutral response is absolutely my mission because a neutral response is actually one of the harder things to come by in what has become an increasingly fractured community.  It's my hope that I have the skills required to plainly state the opposition and I can add to the conversation in that way. Hopefully I can at least lay out the issues of one side, and you will at least know where your friends across the aisle stand so you can proceed accordingly.
The opposition to segwit comes from a couple of things.  The community (hereinafter the "community") opposed to segwit shares most or all of the following in common.
1) scaling is the seminal issue facing bitcoin.  Segwit does not accomplish this in a meaningful way (I'm not debating this issue.  I'm simply stating the verdict the community has rendered).
2) There is a lack of transparency from the core devs and blockstream regarding this "segwit or bust" mentality. They could explain why they're doing what they're doing but any attempts dont feel persuasive.  Roadmap delays are now the standard.  There's a lack of urgency and communication regarding this issue and the problem is several years old. Moreover, this mentality has made the community suspicious that Blockstream does not share the "original vision" of bitcoin. This term "original vision" obviously could have its own stickied thread.  But without getting lost in the weeds,  shareholder value for Blockstream is now the driving force behind bitcoin development.   Contrast with global, instantaneous, frictionless banking at virtually zero fees and the rift starts to come into focus. For example there are problems jeopardizing that vision such as increasing fee tx and a congested network.  The primary company running point on bitcoin development seems unconcerned with this, meaning that vision may no longer be the direction bitcoin is taking.  And if it still is the direction, we wouldn't know because transparency is now an issue (bringing us full circle)
3) segwit may be an improvement for many reasons.  But the community is not willing to approve segwit because the demands for a scaling road map have been put off and ostensibly removed from the roadmap.  The community feels digging in and not approving segwit is the main bargaining chip.  The community does not want to approve Blockstream ideas and proposals, like segwit, when at the same time their demand for larger blocks now have been completely dismissed without convincing rebuttal.
I'm interested to see how this turns out and I hope it's well received.

This is a very important question and I have been looking for a finance/banker type to provide an answer.  The question is "how does btc facilitate access to consumer credit?  The supply is limited and decentralized...so how does the average consumer secure money to create a business or purchase a home?"
See, depressions are caused by consumers not having access to credit. FR banking facilitates this function, but at the cost of an ever increasing money supply.    You can't have fractional reserve lending with bitcoin because there is a FIXED money supply.  I can't lend out more bitcoin than I actually have. This is different from fiat.
With fiat, say a bank has $100.  That's all they have in the vault..well with a reserve requirement of 10:1 they can actually lend out $1000.  This is $900 more dollars than existed previously.  This $900 will be deposited into other banks so it goes into the money supply...but (and this is important) that $900 DID NOT EXIST until the bank made a few keystrokes and cut a check.  This is how the money supply is constantly increasing.  This supply of whats in the vault AND with borrowers is known as high powered money, or the Monetary Base.  
The reserve requirement is typically done to prevent overlending and  bank runs.  But with your example, to loan out 40 of your 100 btc isn't fractional reserve lending because you are lending out less than you actually have.  And unless I'm missing something, it is impossible to loan btc that you don't own.

Aside from getting a hardware wallet, don't talk about it to people.  Don't show it off or let anyone else see or handle it. Don't explain to your roommate how cool your trezor is and your backup seed works.  Dont mention to some girl youre banging that just by typing the 12 words you have written down on the piece of paper you keep in your sock drawer, your entire fortune is instantly, irreversibly accessible. It may sound simple but nobody should even know you have a trezor.
  Keep your seed written down and never on a computer. Don't store your recovery seed next to your trezor. Contemplate having several handwritten copies of the seed. Losing a single copy of the seed is fairly easy to do.  But virtually no one would even know what that random list of words meant should they happen to come across it-as long as you resist the urge to show off or brag about how secure your new fortune is.  
As the prices get really crazy you become an even bigger target.  Keep it secure, safe, and stfu about how your security works.

I'm just saying there is such a thing as  basic legal and business concepts like "friction", "substituons", "competitive advantage " and this hell hole of a sub is ignoring them all. Like...year one stuff.
Basic tenets of good business and just simple logic were paramount over here.  Now I'm being told "more friction =better"  
That is a wrong answer.  Just plain wrong. On any test, any textbook, any examination.  It's just not right.  And the prevalence of this obviously wrong shit posting is why people like me are very gravely concerned for bitcoin for the first time. 
Like I said, I'm hedged. But from an academic perspective, this article is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:34:41
I'm hedged against massive price drops in bitcoin Due to market uncertainty because of indecision or a hard fork. A fork would cause a ton of confusion in the market. How do you split your coins? Which one should you use? How are they designated at different exchanges and vendors?
Philosophical arguments aside, this added complication is not beneficial to a digital currency that aims to be universal, cheap,  reliable,  and easy to use. Meanwhile, other alt coins are doing a helluva job showing a road map, vision, governance, and direction. They grew up and aren't just shitcoins. My portfolio has doubled in the last month by reacting to these fundamental issues.
So tell me I'm wrong, but I've been right so far by making decisions based on fundamentals. And right now bitcoin has the advantage of being the biggest,  but it definitely has competitors that claim they are essentially bitcoin 2.0-all of the strengths,  none of its weaknesses. At some point you get tired of the gridlock, controversy and failed promises. And you're not alone-so if you trust yourself then make decision, act first, and get rich.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:47:40
What is the argument behind letting the split happen and holding coins on both chains? Then the market decides and weeds out the weaker coin, Thunerdome style. Two coins enter. One coin leaves.

Well, OP if you still don't know what the BU crowd's position is then I don't think you really understand the argument, which is a shame.  At this point, both sides are perfectly knowable.  Moreover the mark of a true authority on an issue can eloquently state not only their position but should be able to state their opponents position BETTER than their opponent can.
I'm hedged in all of this and consider myself part of the "flippening" due to market uncertainty, so I don't care how it shakes out at this point, since there's nothing I can do (except try to add to a discussion when I see the chance).
In short, you're not taking crazy pills as much as you seem to refuse to investigate the debate.  The BU crowd raises a lot of points worth considering. Even today, the top post is a quote from Charlie Shrem that basically says BU's ideas are solid but the execution could be disastrous so he's lost faith in the implementation.  He's still saying it's a good idea, but they don't have the resources to do it well enough.  So the debate is much more nuanced than you seem to be giving it credit for. "Crazy pills" are reserved for flat earthers, evolution deniers and anti-vaccination people.  By trying to lump btc/btu into the "Crazy pill" category the yelling only intensifies and it becomes impossible to make any progress.

This is so stupid I don't even know where to begin. This is an attempt at Shifting the talking points in order to get users comfortable with fee markets for the benefit of Blockstream.  
And why would anyone use a digital currency with massive fees when there's a similar one with no fee? High fees when there are suitable substitutes without fees is an absolute way to lose your competitive advantage.
I've been to business school and law school.  This is really basic stuff I'm throwing out there.

Well, I am yet to hear a reason why the blocksize can't hard fork.  I'm in this space everyday, check the forums, watched every video of AA twice and I haven't heard anything I find compelling as to why the blocksize can't up via hard fork.  I've been told it's "contentious" or "unnecessary" but I can't find any consensus whatsoever outside of the Core Devs that these things are true. 
I tend to be a huge Antonopolous fan. I find he has a real knack for talking about bitcoin in conversational English, and while he is excited about segwit,  he readily says of course the blocksize will increase via hard fork at some point, many times.  Like...it's not even a question.  The only people who seem clearly against it now and forever is Blockstream.  If you have a good link explaining why this hard fork is so risky or undesirable by all means,  post a link. But this reluctance to increase the block size when the mem pool is maxed and fees are up like 40x this year, coupled with the insistence of "only segwit" raises eyebrows.  And if you can't see a huge portion of the bitcoin community is not convinced increasing the block size is too risky, then I think you have blinders on. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:52:53
Ffs can anybody give OP a legit answer?  Condescending quips to questions we all had just grinds my gears and is one reason why this community is so tough to deal with.  We should all do our part to provide thoughtful and insightful responses instead of just brushing off a guest to our community with arrogant "go read more" or "you must be new here" responses. Phew,  end   /rant
OK, so this is a rudimentary breakdown and I'm rounding for easy numbers but here goes.  Right now all the outstanding bitcoin times the current price of $1000 is around 16 billion. This is the "market cap". Compare to Facebook which has a market cap of about 320 billion.  So, if bitcoin got as big as one company (admittedly a big one, but still just ONE), that's a 20x increase and each bitcoin is worth 20k USD.
But how would it get that big? Well, right now speculation of FUTURE and POTENTIAL applications of this promising tech is a huge driving force. But there is no mainstream, killer app YET.  So for now, it is robust infrastructure development of the bitcoin ecosystem like merchant acceptance of bitcoin, easy to use on/off ramps like Coinbase, trusted exchanges with transparency that have fostered the growth we have seen sending the price up to 1k USD. Just let that sink in for a second, 1000 dollars per bitcoin,  and virtually nobody in the global or mainstream sense is even aware of crypto currency. But it's vitally important to slowly grow the foundation and put all of the pieces into place.
 So what would a global application of bitcoin look like? Well take gold, for instance, which has a global supply of 7 trillion USD.  Gold is used as a "store of value" to hedge against fluctuating fiat currencies. People like to buy and hold gold to protect their money.  Bitcoin proponents posit bitcoin is an indisputably superior way to protect, hold, and transfer your wealth than gold.  Now I am just talking about a single use case, specifically using bitcoin as a "store of value".  The rabbit hole goes so deep with potential use cases it's mind blowing.  For example think of remittances (and western union price gouging/outrageous fees). Bitcoin could do it better. Or maybe paying your favorite YouTuber a fraction of a penny for content you enjoy. Or maybe pay a penny to read an article for a newspaper you would otherwise have to subscribe to.  You don't want a subscription...you just want to read this one article, but before bitcoin there's no way to facilitate this kind of exchange or "microtransaction". And those are just a couple often discussed potential applications that could literally reshape business relationships on a global scale, but like I said there really are so many potential uses on the horizon and even more nobody has even thought of yet (think of the Internet in 1995-who could have predicted twitter,  snapchat, IG etc..).
ANYWAYS, back to gold.  For the moment forget all of those other use cases I glossed over and just look at gold; one 7 trillion dollar market.  If bitcoin captured 10% of that market, you're looking at a 700 billion dollar market cap and a price of nearly 40k, and that's if that was the ONLY thing bitcoin was being used for.  
Start aggregating the use cases and before you know it you're in 6 figure territory per btc, even with modest assumptions.  I know it sounds crazy and like a total pipe dream, but when you break it down each individual premise feels very cogent. There are a lot of obstacles but after 8 years there is more activity than ever and just might be the black swan event of our lifetime. So that's my thought on how it would all go down.
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:59:26
The main counterpoint I seem to hear is Blockstream is taking over the commodity of bitcoin and is essentially an evil company trying to dictate how it will develop so they can maximize their own profits.  Nothing is wrong with segwit, per se.  But there is something suspicious about not being forthcoming about straight up increasing the blocksize and forcing segwit on the community without clearly explaining why it be how it is.
Segwit is fine, but not if it means ceding control of bitcoin to a single company with ulterior, selfish motives.
Tl;dr is the $70 million giant Blockstream doing what is best for bitcoin or best for themselves?

I guess I don't understand the wave of public opinion suggesting the powers that be shouldn't take actions to remedy the situation. 
My understanding is basically Dao (voting tokens for ether apps...like crypto kickstarter investment coins) is totally jacked up because of a massive 50 million dollar hack. In light of said hack,  'the powers that be' can basically be like The Architect and 'reset the matrix' via soft/hard fork. This would basically prevent the early funders to not lose their money and not allow the hackers to spend the funds they stole.
Opponents criticize this style of response because crypto is supposed to be decentralized and if there are 'powers that be' who can basically do whatever they want then the freedom the crypto network promises is already compromised.  They argue this an unacceptable  bailout. 
And ya know what? I just don't buy that. An early, innovative idea like Dao will have initial problems and SHOULD continue to improve, communicate with the community, and demonstrate that the community as a whole has the ability to combat fraud and be resilient.  The community should accept that MASSIVE issues like this may require a fork, but shouldn't expect it and any comparison to bank bailouts is a false comparison. An added benefit of combating the theft is deterrence of future heists. Essentially, the ability to fork or 'reset the matrix' in this case appears to be justified...like, why the outrage?

I was about done with this, but in light of you trying to "Dunning-Kruger"  me, you passive-aggressive donut-I'm gonna give this one more whack.  Whether you like it or not, your last post is the **epitome** of why there is an r/btc in the first place.  I'm sure you don't believe me, but it's surreal how many of your "points" are the exact things the anti blockstream crowd takes issue with.  They get what you're saying...but they don't buy it. Let me try to explain what I mean.


Most users think a filled mem pool and a 40x increase in tx fees in a year is a problem.  If you want to characterize this as "not broken" then I think you're out of your mind.  
I mean, right out of the gate you sound so disingenuous.  How could you call that "not broken"?  Really, as a layperson I just don't accept that at all.  The network is frequently maxed out and currently priced out of the 3rd world remittance and mircrotransaction markets because of fees.  Like come on, that is **broken**.  Like, two of the earliest bitcoin use cases I ever heard about (remittances and microtransactions) are already not viable because of 1mb blocks.    
 


THIS RIGHT HERE...That is called being "conclusory".  All you’ve done is *say* it's dangerous and bad, but you don't say why.  How is it dangerous?  This whole two day argument has been about you not being able to explain why this is risky.   I don’t know how to be more clear than this:  **the main opposition to segwit is that other viable alternatives, particularly a hard fork to increase the blocksize is said to be too risky by a select group of people, but no one can explain why this is the case.”**


Right there, another logical fallacy.  This is called an "appeal to authority." You don't give reasons, rather you want me to believe there are lots of experts out there supporting your proposition.  Great...where are they and what is their reasoning?  Again, you can not provide any reasons whatsoever for why increase via hard fork is such a risky proposition. 
Talk about Dunning Kruger…don’t you see how you are absolutely not answering the question?  All you’re saying is “it’s dangerous because experts say.”  That is not evidence, you waffle. 


And this is just as shocking as everything else.  Of course segwit increases the blocksize.  I never said that it didn't....I'm listening.  Do you see me listening?  Yes, segwit increases the blocksize- but CLEARLY I am talking about increasing the blocksize via hard fork. 
So to close, increasing the blocksize via hard fork was something everything thought would occur a long time ago, and now it's bene pushed off indefinitely.  Instead, we got something called segwit.  "Hey, looks great," said everyone, "but about that hard fork?  What about that hard fork?  Guys, remember the hard fork?"   When the community asks why, all we get is a bunch of bullshit answers like you’ve been providing, namely:
-Hundreds maybe thousands of experts say we shouldn’t
-It’s contentious
-It’s risky
-We are fixing something that isn’t broken.
BashCo-Those are not reasons.  Why can you not see it? Surely you must see that those do not answer the question.  Two are conclusions.  One is a straight fallacy (appeal to authority) and the fourth is just so far in the weeds I don’t even know where to begin.

What's funny is they will say "you 'were' right" instead of "you 'are' right" which is why they won't buy coins TODAY even though us optimists believe coins in the hundreds are dirt cheap, in the long run.

Pegasus, you take a lot of crap for being a fringe bitcoin evangelist, or a zealot. But you know what, I like that you have positive ideas and that you contribute.
What's far worse is that all of your detractors give such shitty, barbed critiques of your posts. The comments on your posts are a prime example of how this community is inbred and holier than thou.

The article mentions economist Hernando de soto. Won a Nobel prize in economics and all around genius. He came to my college back in 2006 or so and gave a guest lecture in his book 'the mystery of capital' which i still have on my bookshelf, where he basically says 3rd world countries can't develop without a way to own property, store wealth, and access capital. All the stuff bitcoin solves have been recognized as huge problems by the world's leading economists pretty much forever.
 I mean, think about it, the only viable solution up until now to solve these problems is basically foreign direct investment or government intervention to create banks, and issue fiat. But now the invention of banking is evolving, one major new advantage is its universality and accessibility. Its kind of exciting to see all of this school stuff come to fruition a decade later.

I just placed an order for my dad in colorado. He's going through health issues now and requires a high protein diet. I'm pretty sure he will love this and will be a nice surprise when it arrives.
Paying with btc was simple, as always. Keep it up.

Yea that's been happening to me too. I like my trezor. But it really seems like a gimmick. I'm worried the hardware will fail or the device will finally stop being recognized.  
Yes i have a recovery seed in a secure location, but honestly how is a trezor superior to an encrypted paper wallet for long term storage?

I use betcoin.
Don't use infiniti. Their launch flopped. Zero players and I'm in a serious multi week struggle to get my initial deposit out of there because their software is shit. The 'cashier' tab won't load. To be fair, they're 'trying to help' but ffs..

That is damn decent of you.  Yea, I forgot to use the code.  Thanks a bunch!  I'll be sure to let you know what he says.  Is the lime pepper jerky going to be available soon?

Jamie dimon, who has made a fortune off traditional banking? Who bought off the DOJ for 13 billion to end their criminal investigation into his banks role in the 2008 financial crisis? Yea ok, this guy should be trusted.

To make trade the crypto profit:
1)get bittrex. buy 10 coins in the top 1-25 per coinmarketcap. Pick good ones.
2) Track on blockfolio
3) sell 25% of portfolio when blockfolio turns all green. 
4) buy back when blockfolio is all red.
5) repeat steps 3 and 4
Play off these 20% market wide swings that happen every couple days. Take advantage, don't get greedy, practice security, learn the risks. I'm serious that last one. Messing with cryptos is no limit, all the time. So don't say nobody warned you.  Still interested?  Ok. Fortune favors the bold.
Congratulations, you're all set to panic sell your Student Loan payments. No need to thank me.

But ok the backup seed is the equivalent of a paper wallet, right? Like that's the fallback position if my trezor fails..so I just view the hardware as an added level of security. Still i totally get your point and lay awake wondering how my trezor is gonna get gox'd.

Ok problem with your comment: 
Anyone who advises get around these requirements by MEETING UP IRL to purchase bitcoins for cash is just crazy. Plain and simple. That is not sustainable, and not an advancement from current systems.
