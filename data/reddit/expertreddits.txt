**Boycott these idiots COINBASE unless you want to potentially lose your money.**
If you have any transaction problems at all Coinbase will give you a generic / canned response "We will forward this to a specialist" and they will never get back to you!!
You wait and wait with these services and they are knowingly sending you in a never ending loop intentionally driving you to give up. Ive seen numerous accounts with people losing thousands with coinbase only to get the specialist response forever, dont use these fools unless you want to lose your money!
If you have any problems AT ALL with your transaction Coinbase will tell you "We will forward this to a specialist" when you have a transaction problem. I've seen multiple reports of people getting nowhere after losing deposits with Coinbase.
Dont believe me just type on "Specialist Coinbase" here or anywhere!
DO NOT get caught up with Coinbase!!

doesn't get its value from its software but from its network - network is run by code smart guy. Amazon isnt software or code driven?

You really have to work toward getting an account established to buy about a month or two in advance before you plan to purchase. If you really want no KYC and want to learn more start mining if you have cheap electric.

I just never hear the argument or rebuttal that code / network does have "value".
