This is so stupid!  
blaming the market for your bad decisions or lack of information on how it actually functions!  
I have predicted the movements of BTC with shocking accuracy in the past, you can check my [tradingview]( account or my [telegram channel]( to see the live calls and analysis for yourself.   
just to give you an idea of what I'm talking about.. I was one of the few people urging everyone to short BTC from 10K price range last year and everyone was on that "lets go to the moon" crack and insulted me for it. 
but when they saw the fall to my targets, they started following me and when I urged them to long it from $3500 and gave my target as $10K, most of them send me thank you messages after it hit the target.   
after the correction of that uptrend, in the most recent analysis I shared on my channel I urged everyone to only long the BTC from $9100-$9500. people who took my suggetion, profited from the move to 13K and when I told them to keep going long as long as its above 9100, they profited from the upticks 3 times.   
  
now if you don't know how to analyze the market and find the right price levels for entry and exit, you will get hurt for sure.   
so instead of waiting for a bull run to form and go most of the way it should go, before you make up your mind whether you should get on it or not, learn how to find the right price levels for entry and exits.  
otherwise you will keep getting hurt by going in when everyone else is getting close to getting out!

I have answered this exact question here  [Why would any successful trader start teaching others? It seems like they are all scams. Am I wrong?](
