It will be worth more than now because of inflation. The dollar will definitely inflate in 10 years as it has been doing the last 10 years. So in comparison to an US dollar's worth it will be more, but that doesn't necessarily mean you can buy more with it than now.
Other than that I'd say it will rise due to a demand in a modernization of our currency. But it could also be replaced by another cryptocurrency. I can imagine that the UN would like to have their "own" cryptocurrency which they can control like the FIAT we have now.

In my mind there is someone working as an editor at OAN who detests Craig Wright and did this on purpose.

The "97% of all Bitcoin belong to 4% of the users" seems to be misleading. Everyone who knows a bit about Bitcoin can tell that most are probably attributed to Satoshi himself and the rest divided between a few superrich guys and mainly cryptoexchange plattforms.
The overall tendency of this article is so biased against Bitcoin (I know it's a commentary). But to me he sounds more like those guys who said, the internet is just a fad 20 years ago. In the end he doesn't even consider any (future) cryptocurrency to be able to replace fiat currencies.
I'm a bitcoin enthusiast. I'm not confident it'll be the successor to fiat though. But papermoney is long past its prime and with the all-encompassing integration of the internet in our daily life it's just the logical next step to use cryptocurrencies.
