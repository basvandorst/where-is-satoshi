Top post: "Al Franken: I think Jeff Sessions committed perjury"
What a joke that sub is.

Right. He's saying it would set a dangerous precedent, which is why they didn't do it.
In the very next paragraph,




Not that it's worth much, since I can't prove this to you in any meaningful way without revealing a shitload of personal info, but I have a family friend who's one of Apple's government liaisons and I can tell you that Apple's stance on security is not a charade. They genuinely have no interest whatsoever in helping the government acquire the capability to unlock iPhones and are actively doing everything possible to make sure doing so is impossible (even for Apple). Their ideal scenario is one where the government comes to them asking to unlock a phone and they can honestly reply "we literally can't".
The government really didn't have any meaningful way to force Apple to comply in the short term, since Apple has effectively unlimited resources to fight them in court and can't be bullied through the threat of litigation like individuals/smaller companies can. If the FBI had wanted to force them to comply, they would have had to get their court order upheld in court through the full appeals process.
There's no reason to believe Apple helped them, simply because there was no real reason for Apple to have done so.

No, way less than 1% is traded each day. Daily trade value is ~500m, not 1.4b.

If you drop 1.4b in bitcoin at once it is 100% guaranteed to noticeably tank the market.

Selling 1% of the market in one shot would cause FAR more of a crash than just 1-5% lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:32:14
Assuming bitcoin stayed at a similar level, at least. But even if you only got to sell at current prices for a few months you’d be in great shape. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:29:43
Ok, it’d be like selling 9 billion in AAPL...
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:36:30
Sorry, this sub wears on me a little sometimes haha. 
Agreed then. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:54:02
It does it doesn’t work like that. Putting that much out on the market at once would cause a price crash. 
You’d have to meter it out over months or, more realistically, years. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:10:23
Regardless, selling 1% of the total market would absolutely crash it. 
That’d be like someone selling 10 billion in AAPL in one day. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:30:57


~~Yes, so having one single person sell *the entire volume of trade* again on top of that would be catastrophic to the market...~~
~~Do you think everybody else would just stop trading AAPL for a day or something?~~
Agreed.

That was one of the more obviously sarcastic comments I've seen on Reddit lately.
