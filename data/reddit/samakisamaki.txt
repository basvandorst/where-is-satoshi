Welcome to reddit dude. One big toxic waste website.

That is because they know that all those things are to impress other people. They dont need to impress anyone.

Yes, they use smartphone wallets, also before last year bitrex did not require you to verify your account and stuff. Africa leap-frogged banks, telephone lines and hardwired internet. Most places you can get pretty fast 4g, even in some very remote areas. A lot of people also use 4g wifi boxes so they have nice connection in their homes. 
English is not difficult for most people in East Africa, english is taught in school from the first years. Also Many countries in East Africa were part of the British empire, so english is not foreign to them. 
They heard about bitcoin on reddit, facebook, telivision. For many people in Africa digital money is not a weird idea since most of the population already use M-pesa. Bank accounts alarw what people are scared of. 
I think blockstream would be a very good idea there. 
Most places in East Africa are still very poor but there is a fast growing middle class that grew up with the internet and do not want to be left behind. Rwanda, for example, wants to be completely cashless by 2020. 
Ignorant people dont ask questions ;)

I would have used fiat if I wanted to exit completely. For me the advantage was that I could quickly buy back in again.

Bitcoin.org is not widely used or known. Facebook is where people continue to learn. Facebook comes free with most mobile contract plans. Some mobile plans even offer free youtube after midnight or outside of peak hours. Websites usually dont work very well because they take long to load. The platforms people use the most are facebook, instagram and youtube and you can use facebook to bring people to reddit to learn more.

I understand what you mean. Sometimes it feels like Africa is a big experiment.

I earn btc by buying it for people in East Africa. Most people only cary cash. They give me cash and I buy btc for them and keep a percentage of btc as as a fee. I also did private “investors” meetings where I would tell people how everything works, they would have to pay me 5 usd each to sit and learn. I also did seperate meeting for wealthier people and would charge them 50 usd and there would be a small party afterwards. With the famous ATH last year, the price went down and I tethered everything and that was the best thing I ever did.

That is like saying that a contract is exactly the same as a blank piece of paper. When you have a bill of €10, that means that you hold a contract to which the government is accountable. Money is not imaginary, even if it is based of the fiat currency system. Monopoly money is not a contract to anything except sore losers.

This is what negative people say to make themselves feel better everytime someone wins the lottery.

Rich people don't use their money to pay for things, they use it to accumulate more debt to buy more real estate. currency is for poor people. :P

We should ban articles from the btc sub for 1 year and see what happens.
