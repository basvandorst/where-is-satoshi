Andreas and others say the incentives aren't there for Ghash to directly be a bad actor, but they have incentive to sell control/influence to someone who wanted to be a bad actor (country with capital flight issues, competitor like Visa/Mastercard).  If I was a payment processor worth over $100bn, why wouldn't I pay Ghash to eliminate a very real competitor.  Point is: other people can give Ghash incentives to not act in bitcoin's best interest.

If you would like to assign a different risk tolerance to these "winnings" than your initial outlay, go for it.

They sold some gold, which resulted in the price going down $3.50/ounce ($1562 to $1558.50).  As a result, the price of gold was below the strike of a digital option ($1559) and Barcalys avoided paying out $3.9m.  While this is a despicable thing to do to the counterparty (especially a day after the LIBOR fine), it hardly moved the price of gold in a substantial fashion (like you are suggesting in the post).

Fortress.  Some funds self impose rules. Like not being allowed to invest in vice stocks (tobacco, gambling, booze, etc).  Doesn't mean no funds are allowed to.  I know large funds that send an employee to Eastern Europe quarterly to wait across the street from a private company that pays its employees in equity shares.  When the employees leave on pay day, he is there to buy their new equity from them because all they want is cash.

To put some made up numbers on it.  Suppose you bought 100 at $10.  At the time you had $10,000, and were comfortable with having 10% of net worth in bitcoin.  Today, you would have ~$100,000 in bitcoin and slightly more than $9,000 in other things.  Are you comfortable now having 92% percent of your net worth in bitcoin.  Maybe so, but that's a very important thing to make sure you are comfortable with.

I guess I should clarify.  There is no such thing as house money, so don't treat it as such.  Money is either yours or not yours. I completely agree with OP.  If you invested 10K and its worth 30K now, you need to be comfortable with investing 30K.

Exactly! The amounts to get in today could be "trivial" for all we know.  I don't disagree with it being a great call option and all that, but when thinking about downside risk percentage moves are more relevant than absolute moves.  Penny stocks don't have less risk because they are closer to zero.
Someone said "floor risk" was "very small".  That is mathematically not true.  It was 100% then and its 100% now. Evaluating historical risk is not the same thing as evaluating historical perceived risk.  Also, you know nothing about whether I am participating in this "party".

I am not.  If you have gains on spent coin, you have to pay capital gains tax.  Not positive, but 15% if held over a year and 35% if held less than a year would be my guess.
Alternatively, if you have losses on spent coin, you can use those to offset other capital gains for the year.
