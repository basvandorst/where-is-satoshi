I think giving it as tips where tips aren't expected/mandatory is the best course of action. For example, if you tipped this way at a US restaurant where 15-20% tips are expected, you would likely be considered an asshole by the staff (although you really aren't!).

Spread the word about Bitcoin and crypto in general among your friends. That way, instead of smoking or drinking, they'll be crypto mining and the community will grow :)

Doesn't less Bitcoin in the ecosystem make BTC more valuable?

I completely agree, but I know many will take it as an affront/insult, especially those who think Bitcoin is "pixel dust". I love how you included cash with the $10 in BTC, but that does get quite expensive ($20 is a fairly large tip). I myself am inclined to try it because I like tipping staff, and luckily I am able to afford to tip in both BTC and cash. For those that cannot however, you shouldn't tip those that EXPECT a tip in Bitcoin unless you include cash as well, only in places where tips are optional

Great way to both reward hard-working employees and spread awareness about Bitcoin! Great job! I might just copy your idea :)

I don't think it would make you an asshole personally because its given with best intentions, but yeah, a majority of wait staff would think you are assholes and in general it might be seen as a real dick move (more work to get their tip). That's why I said in a follow up that you should tip BTC ON TOP OF cash not INSTEAD of, so if a server really went above and beyond you can give them the standard 20% (or whatever your locality's expected amount is), and then add a BTC paper wallet like the OP to both show appreciation and to spread Bitcoin

Have to pump up these useless scam projects like Bitconnect somehow...
