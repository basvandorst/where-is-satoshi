Great, explain that to your wife when you show her you blew the kids' college fund.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:27:41
Quick! Take out a second mortgage and buy buy buy!
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:17:32
Yes, because irrational blind faith is always a sound investment strategy.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:57:36
If you can't grasp the material in this video, what are you doing investing in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:55:15
You guys make me lol. I will flip you a worthless fiat dollar when you are panhandling.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:37:06
Excellent article. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:59
I'll flip you a quarter when you are panhandling in a few months.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:48:45
If you are HODLing since this was posted, your value has decreased at least 10%.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:00:21
Unless, of course, it goes the other way. 50/50 chance.
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:38:37
I take it you didn't buy in at $19,000
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:02:35
Seriously, we did try to warn you.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:54:56
In other words, please buy up Bitcoins and keep the price up while I quietly dump mine.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:23
That's what they were saying in 1929.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:52:30
If you "bought the dip", you lost money today. Why take financial advice from silly memes?
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:53:15
Yes, the blockchain is truly revolutionary. Yes, bitcoin is Tulipmania 2.0. Yes, cryptocurrency is a nail in the coffin of the bankster parasites. Yes, digital currency is a tool of the totalitarian tyrants. No, these statements are not contradictory.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:58:50
Don't panic! HODL like it's 1929!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:00:40
Worst case is it dipping to $0. Hoping and wishing are not good investment strategies.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:59:02
It's so obviously a bubble I don't know how you cannot see it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:53:02
How did that work out for you today?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:39:06
That's what they were saying in 1929.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:16:05
Wait for the fifth major dip. What will you post then?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:59:52
Yes, faith-based investment always turns out so well.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:28:39
How does it feel when your $9K purchase slips to $3K?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:52:00
We people who are dumping bitcoin appreciate very much people who hold your investment philosophy. Thanks for taking the losses instead of us!
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:01:05
Buy the dip and lose the rest on the next dip.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:57:20
And that new buyer is watching his new bitcoins slip and slide down the bubble luge ride.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:24:31
Yes, the future is bright, until the bubble completely bursts and people are dumping bitcoin like its 1929.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:00:04
If you don't know the answer to this you have no business being in this market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:51:22
Please hold and buy! Keep the price high! It's great for us who are selling!
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:00:19
Sounds like you would have fit right in in 1929
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:05:25
Realists watch all cryptocurrencies crashing through the floor this very minute.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:56:51
Enjoy it today because you won't be able to afford it tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:33:02
Smell the tulips! Ahhhhhhhhh.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:35:16
So much toxic investment advice on this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:58:23
Of course, anyone who is unloading their bitcoins is going to urge everyone else to hold theirs. Duh.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:57:56
They both are classic examples of bubble behavior. Maybe instead of comparing with the tulip bubble, you should compare with the 2008 housing bubble. Everything is fine as long as everyone is buying. Then they stop buying.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:48:17
Bitcoin or no bitbcoin - still an ostentatious asshole.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:59:31
I will remind you that you posted this after the bubble bursts like all bubbles do.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:27:03
Wake up and smell the tulips, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:49:40
I smell tulips. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:43:58
If I were selling all my bitcoins in a panic, the first thing I'd do is get on reddit and say "HOLD THE LINE YA COWARDS, HOLD!" while selling like crazy.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:34:10
This is the same subreddit that stampeded people to take out loans they could not afford and buy bitcoins at $20,000,
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:01:19
Bitcoin is rising! Buy! Bitcoin is falling. Buy! Who can't see through this scam?
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:05:56
If you were a "HODLER" two weeks ago, you are today, what we call in the investment world, a "Loser".
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:14:06
My USD are doing fine. A LOT better than Bitcoing. The USD didn't fall by half in two weeks. But thanks for answering my question about who can't see through the scam.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:27:57
You were telling us to invest when it was at $20,000. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:55:06

Redditor for two weeks. Pumper and dumper.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:49:32
You're one of those guys who was stampeding people to buy at $20,000 of course. But we can't be sure, because THAT account is now gone.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:40:12
Redditor for two weeks. Pumper and dumper.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:33:44
Great. Good for you. And when those coins dip under $1000 will you still say you did not lose anything?
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:11:14
Redditor for ten years, newbie.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:10:24
If Bitcoin were a more traditional financial instrument, regulated by the SEC, people would be getting arrested for Pump and Dump securities fraud.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:13:30
If you believed in your $20,000 bitcoins, do you still feel as good about your $7000 bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:58:15
There is nothing wrong with the concept of crypto itself. The problem is The Bubble in the crypto.

 People confused "enthusiasm with technology and sticking it to the parasitic bankers" with "making a good investment".
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:35:43
It's a good time to review James Corbett's video on the Bitcoin Psyop 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:08:05
Sounds like you got some shitty advice from people whose only advice is to HODL no matter what. You, sir, have been played.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:57:21
Yes, and I have a $20,000 bitcoin to sell you.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:30:11
A lot of people, especially newbies, lost their asses buy buying high, as they were stampeded to do by the Pump and Dump folks on this forum. I was not one of them, but you can pretend I was if it makes you feel better.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:20:55
How much have you lost this week?
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:50:25
People who were pumping and dumping at $20,000 do not want that behavior revealed. Hence, they delete those accounts and start new ones. Duh.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:09:15
You would have been better off investing in lottery tickets two weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:00:11
You really don't understand the concept of a crashing bubble, do you, Mr. Three Weeks on reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:06:53
Sure it is, Mr. On-Reddit-For-One-Week.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:04:06
Maybe I shorted Bitcoin. That would be a great position to be in today, wouldn't it? A reverse Pump &amp; Dump.
