Miners continuing to support the network during a bear market is not meaningless.

Gold is money.  Federal reserve notes are not.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:30:01
You guys really havent been around long enough to talk shit on lucif/masterluc/PentarhUdi...

Currency is not money.
Is the US dollar money?
Seems even Bitcoiners dont know what money is.. smh
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:47:48
Hes close but doesnt have the cycle right.
Peak at end of 2013
Peak at end of 2017
Next peak should be end of 2021.  Not 2020.
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:18:28


Good news!  You are!
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:22:49
I guess I need to do more research/math.  I thought the idea was 7% avg returns = 4% safe withdrawal and 3% inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:42:39
Can you link me to this type of equipment?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:11:29
Gold is certainly money.  A very good example of money.
It has trouble being a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:07:28
No its not.  He was the only miner for quite a while.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:19:37
Whats the catch here.. doesnt say beta or testnet anywhere.. this is yuge???
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:41:02
Safe withdrawal rate is 4% at the most right?
4% of 1.8m = 72k
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:15:40
Uh huh.  Sure.
@_date: 2019-12-03 18:43:15
If Bitfinex is supporting it, it cant be that bad.
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:24:53
Nice icon anyway lol
@_date: 2019-12-03 19:27:07
Arb traders are drooling at this idea.  Instant settlement between pairs across Lightning exchanges... my god!
@_date: 2019-12-03 21:12:24
An irrelevant but true statement.
@_date: 2019-04-06 02:15:52
Every time I go to the weed store I need cash.  I almost never have any on me, which means either making an extra stop to my bank's atm, or paying a bullshit fee at the 'convenient' atm at the weed store.
Shit is a hassle.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:48:05
Appreciate you typing that out.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:09:18
what are you trying to say?
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:03:00
To win all bitcoin has to do is hang around.
Its that simple.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:30:27
Good talk.  Hope you learned something.

Why not answer my question?
Do you think markets are unnatural?
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:58:03
So... can a US person buy COINXBE or not?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:14:05

@_date: 2017-09-05 21:16:27
