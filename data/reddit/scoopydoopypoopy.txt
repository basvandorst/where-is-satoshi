I remember saying this around the end of the first week of December, then shit got crazy. Patience young grasshoppah.

TLDR: do nothing.

It doesn't show BTC/USD (or GBP, EUR) price.

No shit, because everyone ~~thinks~~ knows LN is currently on Steam time; Soon™.

And you're really asking why the backlash? There wouldn't be a problem if he had just made his fork, named it whatever-the-fuck, and let it run it's course. Because Roger Ver is intentionally trying to mislead and confuse people by claiming his fork as the "true original." It's like if someone worked for Ford, designed a new car model using a pre-existing frame, and sold/marketed/claimed it as their own car company called Ford.

Not a bad idea. Makes me want to use a mini-engraver and engrave a plate the size of a credit card.

Generally, the higher fee you pay, the faster it processes. Regardless, there are about 130k unconfirmed transactions so it will be a while.

How can i tell if it's been tampered with/not viable? I bought one off Amazon just last night, i was not aware there was a risk. Company is Reverb LLC.

Fictitious numbers of course. I should have used your numbers, sorry! Does it make sense? You can run the balance after any line to see where you stand. I like using the +/- signs to show how much i have put in versus taken out. Making a purchase of BTC leaves me down $X, so it's negative. When i make a sale, it's +$X. I'm low volume so this works for me, but i plan on continuing like this when i start trading more (i just found out about gdax this week, i'm kicking myself preeeeetty hard).
Edit: I'm an idiot. I should have used the unit $/BTC instead of USD/BTC, but i assume you know that's one in the same.
Edit edit: I missed a line. HOLD ON. And thus you see this first major problem with this way, easy to fuck it up.
Edit^3: Fixed.

If Christmas is anything like Thanksgiving, i could see it getting close to 15k, but almost 20? I'm very skeptical. Would love to see it's past predictions (i have no idea when the site was founded nor when they started predicting BTC).
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:38:06
Nope, give me your money and i will make sure no one harms it. Promise &lt;3

+1. I started to transfer LTC off GDAX to Binance so i could diversify a lot. The interface will take a while to get used to, but i will manage. Now i cannot fucking wait to get every mBTC off GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:30:34
I watched the entire ~600 BTC chunk being sold off. $11.5M USD flew by in a few seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:01:49
Is that even possible?
A-asking for a f-friend...yeah...
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:04:00
The best time to buy is yesterday.

Just to add and be clear; these bets are settled in fiat, NOT BTC. So the futures contracts do not directly affect the price of BTC, they are simply bets on which direction the price goes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:43:15
Yes definitely! I just hope for your sake you did not choose a lower fee because you could be waiting for a week+.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:38
Convert BTC to LTC, transfer to Gemini. Minimal fees on LTC, and very fast confirmations, unlike BTC's 200k unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:18
RemindMe! 1 week "what that guy said."
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:45:08
But yeah no, literally, it's due to decreasing attention spans and getting a quick-witted joke in as fast as possible. I am unclear on whether people actually do care about memeing, but i'm sure some do. It feels like a global joke-gone-too-far thing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:50:28
Pfft fuck no. I enjoy memes just as much as the next guy, i just don't hold a lot of stock in them. ^ayy ^^puns
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:43:22
Personally, i'm using pen and paper (although the digital version)
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:22:20
What time do they launch? I can't find that anywhere, but i assume it is 6pm EST like last week.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:53
Agreed, similar to what i'm doing. I'm already holding some BTC, holding some cash. If there's a dip, buy in. If it takes off, keep holding! Utilize the cash when necessary.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:19:18
I got the email on day 6 of 7 waiting for my bitcoins... and in that time the price jumped ~$1800. Needless to say, I was fucking furious.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:25:25
Because your question gets asked so, so frequently. Especially within the last 2-3 months with the extreme increases.
To share; i'm expecting steady increase through Christmas, then maybe a crash/correction ~20% around the new year. Maybe a small dip (&lt;= 10% after this weekend OR the 18th due to Futures).
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:35:23
Nail on the head. They've been alienating their users for a while, it's getting bad quick
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:54:32
We wouldn't react at all except to say, "hey, that's neat!" There was a big sell from the genesis block last month.  It was pretty frickin rad to see that, but it's still just r/mildlyinteresting.
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:53:44


That is fucking chilling. RIP LiveFreeOrDie.
Great story OP, i'm glad you did well and hope you continue to do so!
