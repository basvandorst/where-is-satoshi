I actually think that changing the core of the financial world could take even more time than it took to change the communication world.
I think Bitcoin is unstoppable, but I think the opposition the internet had was very little compared to the opposition Bitcoin will have. The Internet main enemy was the Audiovisual Industry (and only when the mp3 was invented). Bitcoin has the central banks and governments as natural enemies. I cannot think more powerful enemies than those.
I know Bitcoin is going to win (the same way Internet won against its enemies), but I think it's going to be a long battle.

Everything is available for free now. Never in human history there has been so much quality production as there is now.
Your thesis has been proven wrong time after time. People have been screaming the end of the music since the invention of the tape. The truth is music will never end. Nor movies, nor books. Innovation and creativity didn't stop with the freedom of the internet. On the contrary, freedom and sharing boosters innovation and creativity.
Tired of hearing "without patents who will innovate?". "If everyone can download a song for free, music will die."
Patents protect big corporations and stifle innovation. When knowledge is free, society advances more. And corporations have to keep innovating to keep being relevant.

2. Again yes. See answer 1.
3. Electrum uses a dictionary of 1626 words. 12 words give 1626^12 possibilities. 1626^12 &gt; 2^128. 12 words give more security than 128 bits. It would be easier to bruteforce the 128 bits key than to bruteforce the 12 words.

Everytime you create a new bitcoin (monetary inflation) the value of every bitcoin is decreased accordingly. Who should receive the new created bitcoins? 
A number of bitcoins have to be created initially. How do you distribute them initially since you cannot ask for ids and give a little amount to every human on earth? The solution was to distribute them initially to those who contribute to the security of the network (miners).
Bitcoins are being born right now, and they are being distributed among miners. Once all bitcoins are created, miners will be paid with the fees of the transactions.


Who receives these great quantities of money? Banks, Enterprises, Goverment contractors. Who pays for this? The people. Why should anyone have the power to take away purchasing power from the people and give it to the banks?
If goverment needs money, they should ask for it to the people (taxes). Not push a button anytime they want. Monetary inflation is a silent uncontrollable tax. Every government inflates the money supply everytime they spent too much.

I know the governmet will lose the war on drugs, but it has been going on for 40 years and it can take some more years before they stop fighting. And I think when they stop, they will take their cut and get $46.7 billion in tax revenue based on rates comparable to those on tobacco and alcohol:

Mining is not about built-in inflation. Mining is about reaching consensus and securing the network.
Built-in inflation is just the chosen initial distribution of coins mechanism. Built-in inflation is not required and indeed many altcoins are premined and have no built-in inflation. In fact, there will be no built-in inflation after year 2140 in Bitcoin, but mining is forever.

Fractional reserve means making money from thin air. Fractional reserve is fraud. 
With bitcoins, if you don't have the keys, you don't have the bitcoins.
Fortunately, it's possible to have your bitcoins protected by 2 of 3 multisig, storing one of the keys in an online "bank", another on your phone and the third one safely offline. That way, you can be sure your bitcoins are not being moved to a new address and be sure the "bank" is not doing fractional reserve with your bitcoins. To spend your bitcoins, you login into the "bank", and sign with your online key and phone key.
I hope nobody stores their bitcoins in places like changetip, coinbase, etc... where they can move your coins and make fractional reserve.

I think I understand what you mean. Of the total number of Bitcoin users, a very small percentage are miners.

Therefore 0.3% of the bitcoin users have 99% of hashing power.
Centralization has only increased since the beginning of Bitcoin. Right now a few companies have huge part of total mining.

You should not backup the seed the same way you backup your wallet. You write down the seed on paper for recovery purpouses. In case you loose your digital backups you can restore from the 12 words. Some people don't even save the digital wallet, only the 12 words on paper becoming a paperwallet.
Electrum seed generation is secure, but if you don't trust it you can choose your own 12 words from the list of words availables. Try to use a real random method like rolling dices to choose your 12 words, otherwise you will end up with a not so random seed.

Blockchain gives you a service to access your addresses and make transactions. They don't have your bitcoins. They don't have your password. They cannot block access to your bitcoins, cannot run away with your bitcoins. If they get hacked or they dissapear, your bitcoins are safe because they don't have them.
None of the above is true with coinbase. Thousands of people have lost their bitcoins because they trusted strangers with their private keys. (Every MtGox user).
With bitcoin you are your own bank. There is no need to tell your private key to anyone.
Technologically there is no excuse to ask for your private keys. The proof is blockchain. They never ask for it. (Transactions are signed client side).

What do you think it's easier to obtain, 1% of users computers or 1% of hashing power?
Besides, you will not only need control of the computers, but control of the user wallet. If you can access the user wallet, you will just steal all the users coins. If controlling thousands of wallets were easy we would have thousands of users screaming their coins have been stolen. I only see a few users, not millions with this problem.
Proof of Stake is safer and much more eficient than Proof of Work. Proof of Stake will allow a safer network and lower fees. Altcoins are prooving they have no attacks with Proof of Stake and it will be incorporated to Bitcoin eventually.
Proof of Stake prevents centralization. Proof of work promotes centralization and we are seeing fewer and bigger miners each day. Only big players can mine now. With Proof of Stake everybody can mine, even with your old laptop or your cell phone.

You are right. There are many problems that have no solution but we can find good enough aproximations. For example, it's impossible to send a message and guarantee that both the sender and the receiver know the message has been sent when the communication channel can fail with more than 0% probability.
The sender sends the message, but because the message may get lost in the communication channel, the sender needs to receive a confirmation from the receiver.
The receiver sends the confirmation, but the confirmation may not get through, therefore, to be sure the confirmation has been delivered, the receiver needs to receive a confirmation of the confirmation.
This process never ends and the problem has no solution. No matter how many confirmations of the confirmations are sent, both parties can never be 100% sure.
However with every confirmation, the probability of the receiver having received the message approaches to 100% very quickly. For example, a channel that fails half of the times, only needs 10 confirmations to be 99.9% sure the message has been received.
In real life we can send messages with extremely high reliability over faulty channels. But mathematically it's impossible to be 100% sure.

When demand increases more than supply, the price increases. You are talking about price inflation. Bitcoin was not made price deflationary or price inflationary, because nobody can control in the protocol the demand. Price of bitcoin is market decided. It is not decided by Satoshi Nakamoto or anyone else. If bitcoin is price inflationary or price deflatonary will depend on the demand. The demand can go up or down. The demand could stop completely and the price of a bitcoin would be 0. 


For this to be true, you are assuming demand will keep increasing forever. If demands stops inceasing bitcoin price stops increasing, since supply remains constant from year 2140.
What you can control in the protocol is not the demand, but the supply. Bitcoin was designed to halve its monetary inlfation every 4 years. Therefore Bitcoin is monetary inflationary until year 2140.

Proof of Stake does not favor wealth centralization. PoS doesn't change distribution of money. If you have 1 % of total coins, you will never have more than 1% of total coins with PoS.

* Much more efficient. The cost of mining is almost zero because no need to calculate trillions of hashes.

Amarkov and riccardb, you are both right.
Amarkov, you are right. Of course somebody can be wrong. For example you may think some horse is valuable for you because you think the horse will help you with your work, but actually the horse is not valuable for you because the horse is sick and he will not be able to work.
You cannot always know what is going to happen in the future and sometimes you don't know everything in the present.
Your example is very good. You may think some box has 100$ inside, but the box actually has 125$. This means that people make mistakes. Everybody knows this and nobody argues people make mistakes.
Nobody can argue that. We all agree people make mistakes.
You don't know what is inside the box. OK. You make mistakes. OK.
riccardb is also right. 
Even if you know everything, even if you are never mistaken, a horse has no intrinsic value. Value is not intrinsic. Value is given by you.
For exemple, sometimes you can value more one horse than one kingdom. (My kingdom for a horse!) Sometimes you can value more a parachute than a horse. Value is not intrinsic. Value is not objective.

Bitcoin is looking bubblish to the mainsteam right now? Mainstream doesn't make decisions, individuals do. I thought bubblish was when it was rising parabolicly. Now is not bubblish, now is the time to buy.  If some individual doesn't buy now because it's looking "bubblish", then it's his decision. In my opinion now is the time to buy. That's what I'm doing, that is my choice. I am resposible for my decisions. The individual that doesn't buy is responsible for his decisions. Please don't hide individuals in the word "mainstream".
I don't feel envy for those who bought two years ago and made millions. I don't feel pity for those who could buy two years ago and didn't buy. I don't feel pity for those who bought one year ago at the peak (I was one of them). I will not feel pity for those who could buy now and didn't buy.

Solo mining protects the network the same that pool mining. Solo mining has the advantage that you are decentralicing your hash power instead of centralizing in the admin of the pool.
It will take longer to find a block, but when you find it, you will receive the full 25 BTC and all the transactions fees.
On average you will get the same amount of bitcoins, but in a pool you will receive it little by little instead of big 25 BTC in solo mining.

Hash rating doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is the cost of controlling 51% of the network hashes.
If the cost of controlling 51% of the network is 1 million dollars then we are resistant to attacks cheaper than 1 million dollars. Doesn't matter if that is 1 petahash or 1000 petahashes. If you can spend 1 million dollars then you can achieve 51% and attack the network.
If in the future you can have 1000 petahases for just 1 dollar, then you are not capable of attacking the network.
The security is meassured in cost. Can you afford the cost to mine 51% of the blocks? If that cost is high then the network is secure. Doesn't matter if the hashrate of the network is 1 gigahash or 1000 petahashes.

Right, pools are not the problem. I was not talking about pools, but about miners. Very few miners have a big stake of the hashing power.
Nobody is going to execute me if I join the miners, the problem is that for me, joining the miners means losing money. My laptop will generate so few coins that I cannot even cover the cost of the electricity consumed. It was possible a few years ago to mine with your laptop, not any more.

A wallet may have just one address. But, addresses are not wallets. Addresses are the hash of a public key. A wallet is a collection of (maybe just one) private keys.
Paper wallets have only one private key. Addresses are not private keys. Addresses are not wallets.

I am sure. No one knows your private keys. You can generate your private keys on an offline computer and never connect that comuputer to the internet. You can regenerate your private keys from the seed. You can share your wallet if you want. You can share your wallet seedless, and you will be able to generate new public adresses, but you will not be able to sign transactions (spend bitcoins). You can also share your wallet with the seed included, if you want.

With your method you are not testing for randomness. You are testing for uniform distribution. It's impossible to test for randomness. You will never know if the numbers you are seeing are random or generated from a seed. You can generate infinite random looking numbers, but actually i can regenerate them in my house, because they are not really random.
The only way to see how random the numbers are, is to inspect the hardware and the sourcecode.
Many hardware random number generators had back doors that allowed to replicate the "random" results.

Yes, you are right I should have stated I was talking about *monetary* inflation, since the most common meaning of the word "inflation" is *price* inflation.
The cause I make this mistake is because I consider only important monetary inflation because it means theft and it's the problem we have with paper money (which can be and is being inflated every year). In a free market, I don't have any problem with price inflation or price deflation because I think it's totally fine that the price increases or decreases if the free market decides to do so. (Sorry for my poor English).
This is what I meant when I talk about bitcoin being *monetary* inflationary: 
As you can see Bitcoin has a current annual *monetary* inflation of more than 10%.
As you can see in that thread, they just call it *inflation*, instead of "monetary inflation".
Nobody knows if Bitcoin will be price deflationary in the future, but I wish it to be because that would mean that demand of bitcoins is ever increasing and therefore Bitcoin has become a total success. But the Bitcoin protocol cannot control that, therefore nobody can say Bitcoin is price deflationary because Bitcoin cannot control that.
But I agree with you that ***if*** demand of bitcoins keeps increasing forever, bitcoin will be price deflationary forever.

You don't mine with computers, you mine with coins. The more coins you have, the more proof of stake you have. Doesn't matter how many computers you have, only how many coins you have.
The price of ASIC doesn't matter. What matters is what percentage of the hashing power you can get. Even if it's cheap to buy one ASIC chip, I would not be able to buy enough ASIC chips to have 10% of total hashing power like some companys are doing.

The problem the blockchain tries to solve is consensus on what transactions are valid. 
What's important is to reach consensus of what transactions are valid where no particular group of people can control the blockchain. Proof of work is in control of fewer miners every day. We are seeing how POW leads to a few very powerfull miners. With POS everyone can mine, there is no entry barrier, nor costs.
It's much more easier to reach 51 % of voting power with POW than with POS.
How can POW be more centralized when it's much more difficult to have 51% of the coins than 51% of the hashing power?
51% of bitcoins today would cost 3 billion dollars. Probably much more, since while you keep buying the price of one bitcoin will keep increasing.
51% of hashing power would cost 100 million dollars.
Its much more difficult to control POS than POW.

With PoS you could spend those resources (cost of equipment, cost of equipment upgraded, cost of ensuring uptime, etc...) in something else, because there is no need to spend all those resources to protect the network.

It's true that he could have explained his views more eloquently. However you can try to understand him. He means: "What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a small set of scarce items.
Don't get me wrong. I think he is wrong. I am full in Bitcoin. However I can understand *his* line of thoughts:
* Just because something is scarce doesn't mean it has any value.
* Bitcoins only have value because there is demand for them. If nobody wants a bitcoin, the value is 0.
* Dollars have some demand enforced by the government. Bitcoin is not enforced by the government.
He is right. But he fails to see that those points are also true for gold, diamonds and, in general, everything.
It is obvious that his conclusions are wrong.

Yes they can, but people will not give their bitcoins to banks. And even if some people give them, we are seeing how companies give proof of full reserve.

You appear to misunderstand the mining process greatly. Hashrate does not secure the network. ***Cost*** of controlling 51% of the hashrate is what secures the network. Doesn't matter how many gigahashes or petahashes the network has, If the **cost** of controlling 51% of the network is cheap then a 51% attack is easy.
If mining has not "substantial mining payouts" then there will not be substantial mining investments. If there are not "substantial mining payouts" then 51% attack is cheap. If 51% attack is cheap then the network is not secure, it does not matter if the mining machines can compute megahashes or terahashes.
@_date: 2014-10-20 05:27:14
This is correct. With Bitcoin is easy to check that your balance is intact, that nobody else is using it or moving it.

And the value changes from subject to subject, one particular subject may find it more valuable than other. For example, for me 1 litre of water rigth now is less valuable that 1g of gold, but some other subject may find 1 litre of water more valuable that 1g of gold. The value of 1 litre of water **depends on the subject**. That is what I understand by subjective.
We agree in the idea. Maybe we use different words.

*You don't have to wait that much to have better inflation that most currencies of the world. In 2021 inflation will be 1.9%, in 2025 inflation will be 0.8%: 


*Centralized systems are not possible without trust. We already know what happens with centralized systems. Decentralization is not an advantage, it is just the only option.*


*Email used to be extremely complicated in 1980, now it's extremely easy for anyone to use email. Give Bitcoin wallets time.*


*That is not how it Works. Miners compete for the fees people are willing to give. In perfect equilibrium all the fees are spent securing the network. The fees will be the mínimum fees enough to secure the network.*


*This is just a matter of market capitalization. When the market becomes deeper, changes will be much smaller.*


*Yet Bitcoin is unstoppable in all those countries. All of them use Bitcoin. The only way to stop Bitcoin is to shutdow the internet. And I am not sure that will stop it either.*


*I agree with what you say here. Money for the people just means the money is not controled to enrich central bank owners.*


*At least it's not the past. I don't think you can uninvent cryptocurrencies.*


*Money of the Internet means Bitcoin is digital and it was born in the Internet era, unlike gold or paper money, natural medium for Bitcoin is the digital world.*

In 1996, 1 USD = 113 JPY
Today,    1 USD = 117 JPY
18 years ago 113 yens were equal to 1 dollar. Today, 113 yens are less than 1 dollar. On top of that, 1 dollar today is much less than 1 dollar in 1996 (Acording to [this]( there has been 51% cumulative rate inflation for the dollar since 1996).
The Yen has lost a Little more than the dollar since 1996. And the dollar has lost more than 50% since 1996.

Yes, you are right, it's an assumption. The assumption that nobody is going to spend in machines and in energy more than they will earn collecting blocks rewards and fees. The assumption miners mine because it's profitable. The assumption miners will not mine at a loss.
However, if miners don't care about block rewards or fees, then it's true substantial mining payouts are not required.
My opinion is that miners will not mine if it's not profitable. The more profitable it is, the more energy will be spent by miners. The more energy is used to mine, the more expensive is a 51% attack. The more expensive a 51% attack is, the more secure the bitcoin network is.

Multisig does not mean a 3rd party must see and restrict transactions.
In a 2 of 3 keys scheme, first key can be stored encrypted online by a 3rd party, second key can be stored on your phone, 3rd key can be stored on paper offline. The 3rd party cannot restrict your transactions because you have two different keys which are enough to take your bitcoins. Remember if you don't have the keys you are not the owner.
The 3rd party cannot even know the key the are storing for you because it is encrypted. 
Coinkite is a step in this direction.
However, I prefer copay.io. With copay I have to sign every transaction from two different devices. Hackers would have to access my phone AND my computer at the same time to steal my bitcoins.
