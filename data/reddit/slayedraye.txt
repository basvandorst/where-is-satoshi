My friend has a situation where his grandma gave him an inheritance of 10 grand that turned into 70 over the years by sitting in some mutual fund. When we told him about this stuff back when we got in, he got really excited and told his dad to let him take the money out of his account so he could do it. His dad refused to let him touch the money, probably out of trying to keep him safe, and still to this day refuses to let him touch the money. That was when bitcoin was at 2 thousand. Now he could have made $350,000 had his father allowed him to do what he wanted.
Dont let other people tell you what to do in your life. I assume you're young enough to make back 4 grand easily, so if you win, you win big. If you lose, well it's not that big of a deal compared to old age.

Some of it is dumping alts. The other part of it is that the valuation of a bitcoin is rising so the vaulation of alt coins in regard to bitcoin is going lower and lower and lower. In terms of the dollar, most of them are the same value. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:52:05
This is extremely ironic for a number of reasons but I'll stick to 2 obvious ones.
1. That civil war currency is the early version of the american dollar &amp; is still backed by... nothing. 
2. Alan Greenspan is the same man who said the housing market had nothing wrong with it right before the crash.

Show him Andreas Antonopoulos videos and try to convince him. You may not make 30x but you might make 10-50% and at that point you could sell and make potential life changing money. You could buy property with that money.. or gold or anything. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity that will never again present itself in your lifetime. If you fail to convince your father, you will potentially be short several thousand dollars in your lifetime.

People have been saying bitcoin is in a bubble since it hit 30 dollars.. If you look up "bitcoinobituaries" you'll be able to find all the headlines as btc went up in value over the years. 
If you really want comfort, take comfort in the fact that we are not even at a trillion dollar marketcap with the single most financial-changing revolution in history. I did the opposite and I did not listen to my parents or anyone. I put in 3k at 2.2k btc and now am up over 5x. Just do it.

I can confirm this. I have watched Zimbabwe price since bitcoin was at 2000 selling for 5000 in zinbabwe. Then at 5000 here it was selling at 7000 there. Then at 7000 here it was selling at 12,000 there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:00:58
There is always sell walls at every $500 increment. All you had to do is look through the order book until you find the 200-500 bitcoin sell order sitting there.

if you want some serious adoption acceleration of a crypto on the internet, BAT would be your  pick. Especially once youtubers realize they can accept crypto in the form of BAT for their donations, not to mention they are confirmed for Twitch as well.

It's a derivative, not actual bitcoin that they are trading. There is more liquidity in such markets. They use futures as a way to protect themselves from high risks such as huge price swings of over 5000.

I love bitcoin but gold is as useless as bitcoin is. The truth is that the end of the business cycle is quickly arriving and gold tends to rise in price during recessions. Bridgewater, the largest hedge fund in the world has changed its pure alpha  portfolio to withstand a recession (gold in it). Just use this knowledge to make a decent amount of money during the recession which inevitably will arrive, especially if a dem is elected, as the market won’t like that at this stage.

Gold and bitcoin are both useless to the average citizen. You literally just use them to make money, then you can move along. Idk why people are arguing about this. It’s like watching 2 autists flail at each other.
