Is there one that says “They know you bought into a shitcoin and you lost tons of money. Now their going to go get that money and return it back to you!” ?
@_date: 2018-09-23 14:41:30
Well they created Bitcoin... of course it’s going to be a game changer.. NSA. reverse that and you get Agent Satoshi Nakamoto or America’s Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:03:55
HODL not me!! PIMP BTC like WHORE. DECENTRALIZATION BTC is not. CONTROLLED and MANIPULATED BTC is. MARRIED not BTC!!!
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:01:09
US don’t want to devaluate BTC. BTC was part of the KICK THE CAN to the next political administration. It is what is called the “ NEW WORLD ORDER.” Bet you heard of that one before!!!
@_date: 2018-09-23 14:50:05
VI. Agent Satoshi Nakamoto is in reverse NSA.
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:50:41
There’s no more DEcENTrALIzATion. Ya just got FOOL by false advertisement. BTC can be CONTROLLED and MANIPULATED like a BIATCH. And you know what they say “Don’t get married to a BIATCH!!!!”

The answer is D. This is the reason why our Ancient Ancestor left us Stone Tablet. Its Deja Vu and it’s repeating itself!!!
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:27:59
Holy shit.... that means...WE STILL HAVE TIME!! LOL.

I hate to break the news for you all.....there is no such thing as PRIVACY!! 
Put it this way (analogy): A murderer can kill it’s victim. And no investigator can pin point who the killer is until a PSYCHIC is hired. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 12:15:27
Haha..it’s just to get you thinking. But explain how and why that’s the case?
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:20:12
No that’s fake.
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:58:48
True Crypto Market Cap is a problem and a use case that Blockchain needs to solve...
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:56:16
I bet you can’t do that when there is a set standard for all blockchains, because it will reveal if your crypto is legit or not. And if it not, then you’ll be running siloed and not connected to the real Cryptos..lol!
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:49:48
The Truth is that we need a standard. There are so many blockchains running siloed. In order to calculate the True Crypto Market Cap, there needs to be a way to count the value of all blockchains. I don’t see that happening now. We can’t relied on one website to tell us the market cap, your lying to yourself if you believe that’s the true market cap. Somethings fishy..
Blockchain is suppose to REVEAL the truth, if that ain’t the case, then we have to START ALL OVER!!!
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:18:55
The DAMN CRYPTO MARKET CAP is false. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:21:38
It does not include all crypto and does not even include ICOs. All the exchange there are currently centralized.
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:46:00
It won’t hit that high. your lying to yourself!!! What will hit that high is Blockchain Indexes. Problem is, it’s only available for the RICH.. Bitch!!!
@_date: 2019-11-29 04:40:13
It’s the —-&gt;  NEW WORLD ORDER
@_date: 2018-10-01 02:43:27
I’m not worry about mass adoption at all. That’s probably the the easiest phase in the Crypto stages. It’s like herding sheep to their gates. There’s going to be two big players involved to get this done. One plays the devil and the other plays the savior. It’s so easy these days, maybe we don’t even need a devil and savior. Just get the top 100 YouTuber to advertise it!!!! And no, I’m not talking about cryptotubers. I’m talking about Pewdiepie-like tubers. It’s all plan from the beginning folks. No need to worry!!
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:19:23
Wait a minute... something smell fishy. If there is no CEO,  then who does the updates to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:30:03
So scarce that you can’t physically see any Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-27 06:09:58
It ain’t, cause Diamond is worth more than Gold. Diamond is the the TRUE.....Store of Value.
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:07:08
Haha..you mean you didn’t know. Blockchain is a dumb down version of GODS technology and if we don’t improve or do it right this time, the only thing left will be CLAY TABLETS.!!!
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:03:39
That means MANIPULATION still exist even in the decentralized world.

Here goes a Bad Actor.

The currency is not the important thing in this image. You should be asking yourself “Where’s the ROBOT after the man?”
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:00:45
No, Skynet is just beginning.....HOLY GRAIL BLOCKCHAIN QUESTION - Why are we DIGITIZING, when our Ancient Ancestors decides to leave us Clay Tablets instead?
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:14:42
So everything going to be put on Tendermint? Cosmos?

Does that mean NO MORE OPEN SOURCE?
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:48:11
What if it’s the other way around. If the advance societies doesn’t create a welfare system, then there is no one at bottom to support those at the top of the triangle. Everything falls. Put it this way, we all can’t have a million dollar because if we all do, there will be no millionaires.
@_date: 2019-12-10 02:44:54
Questions is? Are there really any real gold still left out there. You think you own some gold, but are they real or have science found a way to fake you out? Do you trust your nitric acid test or are those fake also?
@_date: 2019-12-05 05:19:34
Hahah. Of course.. Everything including BITCOIN can be indirectly MANIPULATED.  Now, you will be more FAMOUS than SATOSHI if you can find a way to stop that!! That’s  one of the thing blockchain won’t be able to do....
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:54:50
I am Master Yoda of Crypto!  Lol...hahah
@_date: 2019-12-08 16:18:06
I don’t know.... This is may be what they want you to think and the mass maybe falling for it. It doesn’t have to go to Zero, it just needs to go to a point where it become useless/worthless.
It’s possible that in the far future Bitcoin/Blockchain will be name the BIGGEST FRAUD by Human, Cyborg and Robots. FREEDOM is key and there is a lot of mis-interpretation in Blockchain Tech about FREEDOM. The problem is...Most of us will not live long enough to see it!!!
@_date: 2019-12-15 03:53:39
My guess is that It’s not...too many shoe shine boys trying to predict the market. The pros are manipulating and pimping Bitcoin. Don’t get married, or Bitcoin will hurt you emotionally. You may end up paying child support too. Think about it, We already know there’s only going to be 21 million BTC in existence and if that hasn’t move the price value yet, the halving means nothing. This only confirms that this game is rigged. These Canadian beers taste good!
@_date: 2019-12-14 16:05:54
My guess is that.....They can Manipulate the price. With that kind of power, you don’t want to down the network...LOL
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:19:21
Block Halving means it’s another opportunity to MANIPULATE BTC price value!!!  Somebody’s making money and it better you!! Yeah you. I’m talking to you who’s reading this..

@_date: 2019-12-28 00:47:45
What nobody usually mention about Bitcoin is ..... THE BAD SIDE OF BITCOIN.  Reason why: Because .. ..  1. the politician wants to kick the CAN to the public so they can use it as an escape goat (no more blaming the government), although they secretly still in control LOL. 2. The greedy investors who still wants to make money (milk this cash cow) 3. The losers average joes who bought at the high  4. The greedy false YouTube  influencer who wants to be recognized as crypto super stars  5. The wannabe Gods ...hahaha .. the list goes ON and On and On... 6. The down voters who wants the BAD to be kept quiet!!! LoL hahahah
@_date: 2019-12-05 05:30:06
Quote “ Whoever controls the PRICE MANIPULATION, also controls your Private Key” LOL ... So freaking TRUE ...it HURTS!!! LOL..
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:30:35
I called BULLSHIAT!!
@_date: 2019-12-07 19:01:15
Blockchain was a technology built to track every move you make so that you cant fraud the system. So best to pay your tax properly. The question you should ask yourself is... Is the system a Fraud?
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:00:43
Exactly what they want you to think!! HODLing BTC is like HODLing fiat in a saving account!! At least we can burn paper fiat into fire and get warm from it. BTC on the other hand disappeared and can be use as escape goat. Then you realize why ancient ancestor left us stone tablet!! LOL
@_date: 2019-12-12 02:02:34
It’s not important... Why would one care about the halving, if you already know there’s only 21 million in existence. If it’s that important, the price value would of fly to the moon already. The halving doesn’t mean shiat. It’s just an opportunity to manipulate this cash cow by you know who...lol. Only the few big mining pools are going to receive the minted bitcoin anyways...it’s not like everyone in the world is going to get a little piece of it. Hahah. Just watch for all the down vote!!
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:31:57
Problem is...it isn’t yours until you store it into your bitcoin wallet where you hold the private key,...but it’s still isn’t yours since the bitcoins will always stays in the network and never leaves....so the  best thing is to take the value back into fiat and buy something with it so you can hold in your hand.......fuck this technology is confusing!!!!!
@_date: 2019-04-16 22:58:15
Then why the hell did our ancestors left us only STONE TABLET?
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:38:42

@_date: 2019-09-05 05:05:11
I GET IT!!.... what the authors really trying to tell us all is that THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN. It doesn’t exist. It’s all a GIMMICK. Anything can be CONTROLLED and MANIPULATED.
@_date: 2019-09-05 04:53:12
Mass Cypto Adoption is going to require Mass Amount of Fiat... is it just me or Does it just feel like something is very awkward about this?
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:59:45
We don’t even have to use quantum attacks on Bitcoin. Bitcoin futures already kicking the shit out of BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:50:06
Nooooo..tell Bitcoin there’s nothing on the moon. It should just keep going past the Moon!
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:54:24
One World Currency
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:40:31
Problem, is you came back to tell us this...Now the future has changed and not the same....Crap what do we do now? Hodl Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:45:17
The teachers probably lost a lot on Crypto!!
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:35:08
We don’t want record of ownership.. we want withdrawal from the Satoshi BTC wallet!
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:05:23
The citizen are already in Bitcoin and they’re losing on both side now. They losing on their investment and losing on government trust. This is why they’ve gone MAD.  But really...these days it seems like it’s all conspiracy theory going as plan...it just smells fishy!!!
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:52:30
Why didn’t you travel back to the beginning of Bitcoin and bought it then instead?
