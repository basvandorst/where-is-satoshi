In this initial prototype only the seed affects the resulting track - track length is currently fixed at 56 bars (about 2.5 minutes depending on BPM).
I have plans to add parameters you can customise but it will always be pay-what-you-want no matter parameters you set.
Thanks for your interest!

Jimmy, thank you so much for this and (one million times!) for Wikipedia. I try to donate every year and I've just made my largest ever donation to Wikipedia through BTC, hooray!
You rock.
So much so that I wonder if we could get an image of you holding a guitar so that we can caption it "Jimmy Wales On Guitar"?

*tl;dr*: this is actually a good thing!

You're almost certainly right it won't roll fair, and probably less fair than your standard six sided die, and your analysis of some of the problems is a good one.
Also, what if the NSA backdoor your Makerbot with an infill-biasing algorithm that weights the die in some way that is statistically predictable for them?
This is why you should always use multiple sources of entropy. A good way to mix in new entropy is with the XOR operator or by hashing entropy together like the Linux kernel does (with SHA-1).

I was pleasantly surprised to find that 64 rolls only takes about two minutes if you type in the values as you go. I think that's a reasonable trade-off for visibly verifiable quality of entropy.
But also, that is a great idea.

authparty looks very interesting, thanks1

I was considering a couple of approaches:
 * Using counterparty
 * Having the ownership designated by the highest amount paid to a unique address for each song.
The latter means somebody doesn't really "own" the song (as they don't control any kind of cryptographic authority over the hash), more like renting it I guess.
