When that happens I will buy back altcoins��
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:32:24
I just sold an altcoin for BTC worth 91k. When Bitcoin drops a little altcoin’s bleed a lot. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:57:26
I just bought 91k bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:09:53
You can do it����
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:35:06
This year��
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:36:01
I am and I’m fine thanks.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:05:14
My charts says something else. Bitcoin will slowly drop to 7000$ and then crush the wall and go down to 6500$ and maybe then rise slowly to 9000$ again. For a longer period Bitcoin will stay between 8500$ and 9000$. Then in september the bull run will start. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:30:17
Don’t have any fiat left.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:33:48
Ja lige præcis��
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:19:35
It will crush the 7000$ wall within days and go back to 6500$ and then the price will slowly increase to 9000$ and stay stabil until september. Then bull run. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:37:24
Use BRD wallet��
@_date: 2018-05-26 18:27:04
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:49:05
Yes. I am from Denmark and if I sell for fiat, then I have to pay tax. I don’t want that. The tax rate for Crypto is from 0$ to 80,000$ 53% in tax. Above 80k is 65%.
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:58:49
WTF

@_date: 2018-06-22 02:27:58
I hope china bans mining. Then mining will be more decentralized in the rest of the world.

Its a white Ford Ranger from 2015��
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:14:43
Its a classic bubble bursting. Thats a fact. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:57:03
Thanks. Very interesting read. I have bought the dip many times now. I’m just waiting for a bottom now. �� I don’t need the money right now, so I’m a long term investor. ��
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:58:26
I understand your pain. ���� I’m waiting for the same. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:23:12
Well done��
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:07:17
Yes it is.
@_date: 2018-06-05 01:25:45
Because I can’t sleep right now. Its to hot.

You are right. He is Just a loser and absolutely nothing else. LOL.
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:25:54
I use the same strategy��
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:23:45
I use prostitutes often. Great service. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:58:00
I sold 78 BTC at 19200$. I’m just waiting for the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:40:54
False hope again. The market is bearish, we are going down. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:57:43
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:37:15
Very nice��
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:56:15
True story. I’m doing well. Just like the rest of the smart investors. Hodl, believing and faith is bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:12:48
Bitcoin is the most advanced, secure and decentralized network in the world. The perfect store of value. You don’t need Bitcoin for payment, just use Litecoin instead. Bitcoin is the new gold. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:59:48
Lets hope for the best. �� 
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:24:35
Great. Same here. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:33:33
2017 was a bubble simple as that. I know anything about Bitcoin. I’m a smart investor too. Sold 78 BTC at 19200$ now I wait for this bubble burst to end. $1K here we come. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:26:17
Looking forward to that��
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:04:14
Thats the spirit��
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:44:36
The adoption is already happening��

My wife just left me after 10 years. I have the right to enjoy life. And I’m not ashamed about it.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:29:18
There is no competition. If Bitcoin drops all the other child coins drop, same if Bitcoin rises. Bitcoin is the mother of all. I just think we should increase the block size to 4 MB and still use segwit and Lightning. We need low fees and fast transaction time with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:44:12
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:57:32
Cheap Bitcoins ��
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:33:07
It will not fail. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:00:55
You should have sold at 18-19k it was a screaming bubble back then. I will buy back when this bear market is over. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:45:00
I don’t hope this is the case��
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:21:07
They already does. I pay with Bitcoin each time. On weekly basis. ��
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:35:14
Use coinbase��
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:31:07
Then we can buy some more Bitcoin cheap��
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:34:50
All you need to now is Bitcoin not crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:01:51
Bought my first Bitcoin in 2014. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:16:35
99.99 percent of Bitcoin Cash was made by the Bitcoin Core developers. The only thing Bitcoin Cash developers has done is increasing the block size. There is only one Bitcoin and that’s BTC and with segwit and lightning network, Bitcoin Cash will fail. Lightning Network has more full nodes than Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is the most secure and decentralized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin connot fail.  Dogecoin has 3 times the transaction of Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is the perfect store of value and with lightning it can be used for micro payments aswell. We don’t need Bitcoin Cash... use Bitcoin or Litecoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:13:14
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:03:15
I spend a lot of Bitcoins on prostitutes and good food.
@_date: 2018-06-05 01:33:42
20000$ for one day and 50000$ for a month.��
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:11:18
Next target is 6300$
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:15:59
That’s the spirit. Bitcoin all the way!��
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:10:47
BRD is simply the best. Better than all the rest��
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:06:42
Yes.

@_date: 2018-06-07 12:20:41
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:28:33
I have teached my son so he know how it works. He own 1 BTC right now. And he know how to sent from BRD wallet to coinbase and sell for fiat. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:01:30
Great. Cheap Bitcoins❤️
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:19:02
Teach them how it works.
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:09:32
Bcash is an altcoin. They forked from Bitcoin thats why 99.999999999% of Bcash was made by Bitcoin developers. Bitcoin Core developers is the best. Bcash will fail. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:52:36
Wait for $1K 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:44:34
No no no. My first investment was amazon, bought at 47$ sold at 1650$ invested 120k. My only work is investing. I’m a former investment advicer from Nordea Bank. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:20:58
11500$ 1.8 BTC��
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:49:17
I do believe that the bottom is around $1K.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:12:43
Its a classic bubble.
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:57:30
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:41:08
28. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:46:44
We have a problem with the fees. But that will lightning solve. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:12:54
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:47:38
Could be nice.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:22:56
Not the same. Bitcoin should be the only Cryptocurrency. There should still be tokens but only one coin. Not like us dollar, canadian dollar, euro, danish crown and so on. Just one. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:24:23
If Bitcoin was fast and low fees, then there would only be Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum for tokens. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:01:05
I use prostitutes on weekly basis. Great service. I pay with Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:28:59
It is used by criminals just like usd is. The beauty of Bitcoin is that its decentralized and secure. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:24:48
Yes. To many people are scammed, investing in shit projects. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:26:31

@_date: 2018-06-14 21:45:14
I meant 38.
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:54:36
34 min... nothing! You disappoint me. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:03:32
Yes. Lightning network will allow over 1 million transactions pr second. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 01:51:19
I will put them in a token called BRD.  They are way undervalued compared to Ethos. They have a working product and 1,1 million users in 170 countries. BRD is aiming to become the biggest decentralized financial institution in the world. A partner you can depend on, without having to trust.
But if I should choose a currency it would be Bitcoin the mother of all cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:29:48
I love Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:53:41
I love you cheap at $1K baby❤️
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:22:50
The BRD wallet is a decentralized mobile wallet. It works well too. Super secure and easy to use. Try it out.�� 
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:28:27
Yes!!! ��
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:29:32
@_date: 2018-06-04 23:18:10
You can buy Bitcoin via simplex within the BRD wallet. It took 1 hour last time I bought.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:21:29
10 billion. Weak mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:00:59
BRD wallet��
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:17:59
Soon it will. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:13:34
Love it. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:36:37
Use BRD��
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:46:53
Still centralized. They can say what they want. But encryption doesn’t make it decentralized.
