While true, to be fair, people research and study everything (not just the internet). If you've gone into the world of academia, it's ridiculous what counts as research output.

There are such courses about “Internet Culture” at my university, they go into figuring out why certain memes are funny. It’s under media, film and TV studies.

Difficulty is not about that at all....

Totally agree. I'm going to leave a link to Bitcoin's [whitepaper]( and summarise it here - the integrity of the network relies on miners that think 'rationally' - i.e. they mine the most profitable chain. That's how progress moves forward. Deeply disturbing that mining has become some partisan issue.

What in the world - we trade bitcoin in a free market. There are bound to be whales that hold more buying and selling power, that's how capitalism works in ALL markets. Would you like to buy up all the bitcoin in the world and distribute it evenly across everyone, and stop all trading? You'll get your version of 'decentralization' alright.

If this was a lie, I apologise. It’s only what I’ve read, I wasn’t there at the very beginning. Cite your sources though, I’d like to read up. Bolding things don’t prove much.

Totally agree. If the people investing really believed in the tech, the whole front page wouldn't be filled with &lt;---- shitposts and memes. The only future people see in BTC is its ability to go up, which is the definition of a bubble. In terms of tech there are plenty of cryptocurrencies who have naturally progressed from BTC's pitfalls and are, of current state, vastly superior.

At the risk of being banned on this sub for 'promoting altcoin', I shall leave you to your own research. Coinmarketcap is a good start to see what's out there. 
To prove I've got a point about superior tech, I'll name some features prominent in a range of different cryptocurrencies, that solve a lot of bitcoin's oversights (won't name them though, seriously I'm really scared about these mods):
*  Smart contract systems
*  Completely private transactions
*  Better on-chain scaling
*  Cheaper fees/better tx times (somewhat related to above)
*  Proof-of-Stake system for decentralised consensus instead of environmentally wasteful proof-of-work 'mining'
*  DAO-enabled cryptocurrencies (Digital Autonomous Organizations)
*  Cryptos running their ledgers on other interesting variants of the blockchain, that solve Satoshi's original 'double spend' problem without the issues Bitcoin faces now.
You'll also find a lot of these communities are still filled with people who keep tech interest at heart. The bitcoin community has become rather speculative and price-focused, that is never a good sign.

Totally agree. this whole sub is literally 'at war', your value should come as a proponent of good tech. Sticky the roadmaps, dev updates, whitepaper. Let that be the first thing people see when entering the sub.

I'm not trusting him with anything, or anyone else for that matter. I don't buy a coin because I am picking some developer / personality to worship and follow, I don't get why people are attaching people to currencies. If they wanted that, why not just go in on ETH?
As I said, the easiest argument to make in a technical debate is superior tech. Keep the sub updated with technical news, and not this.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:18:30
That brings me to my recurring argument - make technical progress the primary deal breaker. Incompetence will naturally show. Having points like 'he was an ex-convict' isn't really related to much.
Band-aid or not, both sides can agree BTC needs work right now. Even prior to the spam attacks, having 40k unconfirmed tx average is abysmal. Segwit1x failed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:16:18
I'm referring to the tackling of the double-spend problem via cryptographic trust, instead of the 'fiat system' with a government-backed monetary authority that can monitor and fuddle with transactions. Many cryptos including Bitcoin are detached from this fiat system. Not sure what you're trying to get at, but whatever it is I hope this clears it up.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:25:27
Following me around are ya ;) 
I never disagreed that BCH and co. are dodgy people. They are. I'm just saying let the technology speak for itself. As far as I see, many points on that list are ad hominem and unrelated.
Don't see where I established that I'm not trustworthy. That's very rude of you.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:54:19
Honestly, I'm utterly confused why the narrative here is to villainify whales with their legal activities. You can't pretend BTC didn't have shady beginnings, its strength is its detachment from the fiat system. 
Sticky your dev updates, github, LN progress. Both subs need to play fair and stop this religious nonsense.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:10:30
Just copying your hyperbole. Cant say I’m the one obsessed with winning an argument if you’re taking your own figure of speech literally. 
If I had no idea what I was arguing about, I would definitely link a random wiktionary article too.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:55:28
This was a joke? If it was, it's on par with wanting to win a 100 billion dollars and giving it away evenly. That'll solve the world's problems!
That was a comment I least expected from a subreddit championing fiat-detached free markets
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:21:03
You're playing saint, advocating for even wealth distribution on a cryptocurrency subreddit. That's as marxist as it gets. Was that simple enough?
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:39:36
Section about Proof-of-Work and Incentives in the Bitcoin [whitepaper]( answer your question. It's a slightly less than a one page read. Hope it helps.
