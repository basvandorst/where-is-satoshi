Not cash out ... just move it off coinbase for security purposes. (I assume this is what you are asking).
It is not a good habit to leave coins online.  Get a hardware wallet (ledger nano, keepkey, trezor) and send from coinbase to your hardware wallet address.  
This way you control your private keys, which you will generate when setting up your hardware wallet.  Then you just put the keys and the wallet in a nice safe place and relax.  
I hope this helps.

This is the way.  I bought a pile a while ago and put them on my KeepKey.  The KeepKey and my 12 words live in a ziplock bag with a silica packet.  This bag is in a fireproof safe.

I use a KeepKey hardware wallet instead of my phone.  I have it in a fireproof safe with my 12 words.  Every month I take it out of the safe and add earned bitcoins from investments.  Then back into the safe it goes.  I have a big safe because I store a bunch of shit in it, but you can buy a good baby safe just for your 12 words.  It's well worth it if you are substantially invested.  Also, everything said above by @_date: 2016-05-31 06:31:21

If you can afford to lose what you are putting down, maybe.  But asking strangers on Reddit for investing advice is just ridiculous.  I have stocks, bonds, efts, physical holding in gold and silver, and a decent amount of bitcoin.  Don't go all in on one investment if you are unsure.  If you just want to play with a little money, then it is just like the stock market when I got started.  It will make you follow your investments which results in you learning more about the process.  Good luck, and HODL.
