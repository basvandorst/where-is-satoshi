Can I do that even if it still says it's under review?
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:05:54
Jesus, how?
Also, he's even threatening to dispute the trade.

That's the thing, his feedback is all good, 51 positive 0 neutral/negative, been with the site for over a year. That's why I'm surprised I stumbled upon a pushy buyer.
Also thanks for the help guys, first time experience dealing with bitcoin and so far it has been all bad and nerve wracking.

No, I did tell him, sent him a screenshot even. He asked me if my account was new and that it had never happened to him before and I told him that it isn't new, that I'm sure it wasn't me that triggered it and that I'd like to wait it out.
Then he went on a tangent saying (paraphrasing this) how he sent the money, that according to localbitcoins policy I need to pay up before 3 hours, that it's unfair to him because the price changes in a day, he guaranteed with his reputation that everything will be fine, that he wouldn't risk it for such small amount and asked me to release the coins and that if something happened he would help me.
...which I believed nothing of because if he's so sure everything will be fine, he'd be willing to wait out the paypal clearance seeing that if localbitcoins finds it appropriate they can even escrow the coins themselves to him.

Any other direct method you would suggest?

I'm positive a rational human being will side with me when they read the convo and see who's pushy and aggresive. I just wasn't aware shit was like this, I thought bitcoin dealings were easier.
What I want to prevent is that if the payment goes through that I won't get chargebacked out of spite from him and get my account fucked up in a way I'm not aware of.
@_date: 2016-03-18 06:29:51
He might be going for a chargeback after I release the coins. Is there a way I can protect myself from this? I wouldn't even care if I had to close my Paypal account. And fucking thank you guys for all the help, I might've been getting fucked on this one if it wasn't for this sub.

What method would you suggest?

I think I'm just gonna refund him. One question though since there is a refund option when I go to the details of the transaction but I want to know, if I issue the refund, what money does Paypal send him back?    
I don't want Paypal grabbing money from my bank account and since the money he originally sent me is on hold I'm not sure how Paypal will handle the money that's on hold when I issue the refund.
@_date: 2016-03-19 02:28:07
There was. I was afraid of issuing the refund before the payment got cleared to me and Paypal using my balance for it instead of the money he was sending me (I hope that makes sense).
The payment got cleared and I issued him his refund earlier, he disputed the trade and I provided all proof that I had refunded him. I'm awaiting to get my coins back now.
Never again will I be doing this shit. I'm glad people were able to help me here though, my first experience with bitcoin, I just wasn't aware shit was like this, people scamming and stuff.
