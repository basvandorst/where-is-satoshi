Possibly, the government has done things like this before.

I'm thinking of the same thing actually...
It peaked, then it dropped...why? Because people who are in it just for the value (like a stock or bond) see that peak and go "OOOOHHH! BETTER SELL NOW!" the panic of everyone selling makes the price go down, high supply...low demand...
Now China is unloading theirs, why? Because China isn't a fool, they saw the peak, then the drop and said "Hmm...no good, better get out now" but unlike the masses, they waited for it to recover so they get a better price on them.
Now, does China decide if Bitcoin succeeds or fails? No. The users using it do, the market decides as a whole. So if people like you and me and willing to buy it, and companies are willing to sell goods for it, then it's fine. Let them sell, let the price go back up, and let us all get back to mining.

Taxes don't usually go anywhere good, and if they do, it was by accident. 
That and if the government is good at anything, it's figure out ways to get what they want via tax. Want use Bitcoin? Well we don't like it so we're going to tax transactions, "to make it fair for other currency!"

I was about to post the same thing, pretty cool imo.

What this guy said. But I am a little worried about the future, and here's why. 
For Bitcoin to succeed it needs to be used as a currency more, and people need to not exchange it for other currencies.
The Investor - Wants to sell it for a gain.
The Libertarian - Wants it to succeed, but to succeed, it needs to be taxed. Yikes.
The Human - I want the banks gone, but won't this just replace human bankers with phone reps and websites? Are those things better than a standing bank? I know if I call my bank, they don't help, go to the local wellsfargo and they'll try to make me happy to not go to the Bank of America across the street.
Not to be negative in this very positive thread, just curious if anyone feels the same or differently.
