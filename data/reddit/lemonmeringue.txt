So not sure if I'm missing something, but besides the ease of conversion I suppose, what's the difference between this and just holding USD in my bank account?

Like bittip for email addresses? I could write something like that, but I wonder how much demand there would be.

Google's working on [SPDY]( which is one example.

That's already in the protocol:

You ended up with a $35k loss after buying a place during the 2008 recession? Yikes that sucks...

What kind of plastic did you use? I'm having a lot of trouble putting the pieces together, the tolerances are way too tight.

2hJZoD5CEfo1FhVr6FKvqtoEdFFGPP8Ay4xBqA2xsNUW is a base58 string, not a base64 string. :) Most bitcoin-related things are either base58 or hex.

I take it he means "the game" as in the app, since it collects our email addresses. :v He also mentioned it in [a previous post](
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:54:16
I guess I glossed over that a bit. To convert to an uncompressed key, you use the hex version of the compressed key as the secret exponent. I picked that up on a stackoverflow post that I can't seem to find now...

Downloading the app and playing the (awesome) game tells you to enter an email address, and you get an email saying
 








































It also has a link to [CoinJar]( Incidentally, [the company]( that made the app also designed CoinJar's site, so I assume that's why CoinJar was picked. Anyways, you send the one satoshi request to spacepirateJ, and you get one satoshi back with a note:
    9be8a7648840d93b528465eaa167fea7b92d6042fd7666219b9fcba007034c3f
Take this, throw it into [blockchain]( and find the public note.
    61 72 72 67 68 68 68 20 79 65 27 6c 6c 20 66 69 6e 64 20 77 68 61 74 20 79 6f 75 72 20 6c 6f 6f 6b 69 6e 67 20 66 6f 72 20 61 74 20 68 74 74 70 3a 2f 2f 77 77 77 2e 64 69 73 63 6f 76 65 72 62 69 74 63 6f 2e 69 6e
This is just a hex encoded string, so head over to [brainwallet]( and convert it to text, and you get:


Visit that site, view the source, remove all non-ascii characters, and two things stand out. The number sequence:
    290-10,317-9,309-72,376-26,331-61,484-22,389-44,348-50,550-44,445-75,464-29,540-40,651-30,634-50,550-32,528-43,501-36,579-41,509-30,484-32,491-36,523-36,598-43,666-33,669-1,653-32,653-33,412-40,456-51,546-8,565-51,497-36,479-57,417-70,650-33,606-20,593-53,644-31,664-52,662-52,650-54,561-50,576-53,503-36
and the lyrics to "In A Sweater Poorly Knit"
The second ends up being a red herring, but the first is just the line of source code and the character on that line. I figured this out because each line has at most 80 characters and the second number is always less than 80. A [quick program]( to do this because I'm lazy and don't want to do it manually, and you get the private key
    2hJZoD5CEfo1FhVr6FKvqtoEdFFGPP8Ay4xBqA2xsNUW
The last step is to identify that this is a compressed key, so back to [brainwallet]( throw it in as the private key, hit compressed, grab the uncompressed private key, load into [blockchain's wallet importer]( and let it sweep the address.
THEN GRAB A PARROT AND GO ARRRR!

Okay, sounds like you've got a good business plan! :) Just out of curiosity, would you be willing to link to your store?
Thanks for the tip too!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:12:06
I marked them, so if they're false, do I get a cut?
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:34:49
Dunno. If I knew, I'd be one of those millionaires.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:58:58
I don't really understand how this is "for bitcoin companies". It seems like it's an identity verification service with a probably nicer API, no? What's special about bitcoin here?
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:20:13
It mostly has to do with the varying fungibility of BTC on a specific exchanges. In the case of Kraken/BTC-E, Kraken only lets you trade between cryptocurrencies, so it's less fungible than BTC-E, which lets you trade USD/EUR as well.
The BTC price is higher on the less fungible exchanges because the difficulty in converting it back to something more common (USD/EUR) is included in the price. It sounds a little backwards, because you'd think lower fungibility means lower demand, which means a lower exchange rate, but think of it instead of USD/BTC, the inverse, BTC/USD, so Kraken has a lower BTC/USD rate, which follows that thought process. There, the lower BTC/USD rate is due to the fact that it's difficult to convert out to USD, so people are less willing to buy into it.
I couldn't find any evidence to back that up though, so there may be other reasons as well or reasons why my reasoning is incorrect.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:33:37


I'm willing to guess that that's pretty difficult to reach.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:39:52
Okay, so how is bitcoin relevant here? This service sells itself as a service for bitcoin companies, whereas what you just described seems like it's just a service for companies that transact. Bitcoin seems largely irrelevant.

If you scroll down, you'll notice that he's been doing this daily for the last four days at least, so this isn't his first puzzle. :P

Given that Bitcoin is pretty tech heavy, for a lot of people including myself, *that* is the fun.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:08:21
I love the idea, but I think you should add another layer to it. Right now, it's way too easy to write a program (as in, I'm considering doing it ;D) to constantly monitor your tumblr and when there's an update, take the sudoku, OCR it, solve it, and automatically transfer the money out of the wallet. Something like that would outpace a human by far, even using a solver, so it wouldn't give anyone a chance.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:13:46
Wow this is really cool! I'm definitely going to try that out.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:48:01
You still haven't said why bitcoin is special here... what's differentiating this between any other identity verification service? It seems like they're just leeching off the bitcoin name to gain customers in a specific sector.

So like, a dollar a day. lol. If you can post a bot, then maybe it's worthwhile. :P

Following the chain upwards, it looks like they use [Liqpay]( to do credit card payments. Seems like an odd choice, but maybe it's related to chargebacks?
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:29:20
Yeah, pretty much. It's like "alright, I hit my $500 goal, time to sell off a chunk." It's a lot easier to come up with a solid number than to be like "alright, I hit $532, time to sell!"
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:11:54
Okay, you first!
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:55:13
Not to rain on your good samaritan-ness, but this seems like a really bad idea. You're taking on the risk of your customers.
Say, today the value of BTC is $500/BTC and within a month it's $600/BTC. A customer can buy your product valued at $500 and redeem a $100 difference (for which they can buy a $100 product for resale). On the other hand, if BTC drops $100, say it goes to $400/BTC, they have a $500 product, which maybe can't resell for a full $500, but could probably fetch more than $450.
What you're offering actually sounds a lot like an options contract with maybe a couple extra hurdles for the buyer to jump through. Again, I applaud you for thinking about your customers, but this may end badly for you.
