Pretty much what the title says. Happy 2018 to this amazing community. I have learnt more about bitcoins and altcoin investing from this sub than any other online resource out there. And this is how I wish to pay you back, in form of a price search engine which can hopefully save you 10-20% on your trades. Yes! I did the math.
So this is a tool which I wanted for myself. I hold accounts in all major exchanges: Binance, Gemini, Poloniex, HitBTC, kucoin, you get the idea. And whenever I went to place-in a trade I would manually check the prices on 2-3 exchanges before finalising the trade. Surely, there had to be a tool which can quickly get me the price data from these websites and suggest me the most profitable trade. Sadly none found.
So I made it. Coinscanner.co not only gets the price data from 110 exchanges and the top-300 cryptocurrencies around the world, it supports 46 fiat currencies and allows you to convert from Crypto-to-Crypto, Fiat-to-Crypto, Crypto-to-Fiat and even Fiat-to-Fiat. It takes advantage of arbitrage across exchanges to help you save money on your trades.
But it doesnt stop there, it even suggests you intermediary currencies which you need to convert, in order to do the transaction.
Check it out guys, I hope you like it, and I hope you can save some money from using it. I would love to hear from you guys, there is a feature request section on the website for your suggestions. Let's together make this tool awesome.
