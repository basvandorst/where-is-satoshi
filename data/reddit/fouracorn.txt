Lol... I was laughing about Bitcoin being Beanie Babies from day one... Finally the reveal: the emperor has no clothes.

The same could be said of tulips and beanie babies before they came cratering back down to Earth.
Now true, the first bitcoins cost practically nothing to make whatsoever, so they were fractional pennies. Unlike bean sacks or tulips, they had absolutely no cost (or inherent value) -- so the "speculatory inflation" was pure, even purer, than the beaniest bean bag.
From that perspective, yes, even now you could have made more than the beanie baby hype. It was basically "bigger idiot" money, but money is money (as long as you have it in FIAT, something with actual value).

Or he can't do math. Typical Bitcoin investor - greedy and ignorant

Who is to say Bitcoin will be the chosen crypto, particularly due to its excessive electricity waste? And again what's so glaringly bad about fiat? Bitcoin is like iPhone 1 ... a dinosaur that nobody uses now. It's going flush. Its value was 99.9% speculation. I predict a bottom of $50 in a few months.

Great returns so far, actually.
I would say your mom is a depreciating asset, but she already "bottomed" for me last night and made a rise happen. Classic pump and dump.
The spermazoa I shot out are worth about as much as a bitcoin will be in 6 months' time, LMAO

The bottom is yet to come. When it gets to $10 a coin maybe I'll buy one for yuks.
