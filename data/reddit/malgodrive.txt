No, there are people exactly like this... I can confirm
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:05:45
Nice, I had almost exactly the same situation. HODL on
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:28:46
yes, to get where I am you constantly need to resist the temptation to sell half
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:26:51
Lending on Poloniex and Bitfinex. This is risky though as you have your coins on exchanges. I got fucked during the bitfinex hack, but at least bitfinex handled it well and i got more back in the end than i lost.
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:48:29
I actually got hacked once and a hacker stole $2K worth of bitcoins from me on an exchange. Should have enabled 2FA back then. But that was the price i had to pay to get more aware of the risks of crypto

i did not do any major buys anymore since the beginning of this year... what i can afford to put in now from my normal salary dwarfs the price increases. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:50:45
Convenience mostly

i mentioned bitcoin at work or to friends a few times over the years but they usually were not interested or laughed at it, so i mostly stopped advertising it. with two exceptions. a friend bought some this year after me pushing him (he bought like 200 bucks at 1800 and sold at 2400), another one is still long but always asks me when to sell :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:46:36
as i wrote in the title, i made 12x, so divide $1M by 12
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:27:07
Western Europe. Cash out very slowly or spend crypto using crypto credit cards such as TenX or Monaco
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:59:24
only a little bit.. wait for the next crash to put in more
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:00:00
i continued, albeit very carefully and in small amounts, after it rose back up i increased the buys. From the beginning of this year i almost bought nothing anymore
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:44:51
Don't give up, good luck with your health and investment
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:22:40
I have two Ledger Nano S and plan on putting the seed in a physical vault. Some friends know I have "some" btc, but they probably think i have a few bucks of play money in it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:02:42
I made a little website just for myself with a little database behind tracking my earnings (i have some unsignificant amount of other coins too). i can (and do) check it all the time (also on my phone). i know it's a bit excessive and i hope at some time i don't need to check so often anymore
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:05:30
Thanks. The goal is to retire early. I live in a expensive place, so btc going to $100'000 would surely help :)
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:55:56
completely agree. it's a gamble, except if bitcoin is really a once in a lifetime opportunity and destined to suceed. but who can know that...
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:02:19
honestly i don't know yet
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:31:37
Nice ! Keep going
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:33:25
right :)
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:48:10
i would do that, but i have some responsibilities where i live. maybe later
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:50:40
Thanks for your valuable suggestions
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:54:57
Wow congratulations. You'll get to $1M soon my friend.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:56:47
I am lucky that i have a job that i like and i haven't changed anything about my life because i don't want to spend yet. I am still thinking about ways to generate a regular income from my holdings, so i could just live off it, but i think for this i probably need about 2-3x more. What is different however is that i feel financially quite secure now
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:35:12
better you buy some and hodl.. it's still early
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:39:35
i ran one before the UASF and probably will start up one again soon supporting core
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:42:57
I did not trade and only held and accumulated slowly over the years. I also sold my bitcoin cash and lent out a small amount to further my bitcoin hodlings.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:43:18
Get more free shitcoins to dump
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:26:18
I am doing a programming job but have another background. I first read about it probably in 2011 on Slashdot or other tech news sites. Over the next two years i saw bitcoin articles a few more times but always immediately skipped over them... in 2013 i thought, wtf is this thing actually and started to inform myself
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:52:21
A lambo should not be 30%-50% of your wealth I guess...
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:59:14
Thanks. I am going to spend sooner or later, otherwise the whole exercise would be pretty pointless. It will be a redistribution of wealth once the early hodlers want to realize some of their profits
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:55:00
Congratulations. I am sure there are more people like you who get a much bigger return than me just holding. As I said, I am not a good trader, so my strategy is less profitable than yours. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:45:34
when it slowly fell to about $200 after the second 2013 bubble. but it's been a constant emotional rollercoaster... the direction of the price movement is usually correlated with my mood
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:50:54
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:56:39
Not planning on selling yet. i think i would regret it later
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:21:00
Something like this, as far as I understand. I ordered a TenX card but it has not yet arrived.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:56:46
i have &lt;10% in Ethereum and a few airdropped shitcoins which I sell as soon as they pump
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:38:29
my absolutely latest exit point would be when my gains shrunk to the initially invested money. but even if i lost everything i would be fine. but i will probably take some money out sometime to hedge against a black swan event or similar
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:45:08
Congratulations! Very impressive self-control :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:47:01
Holding and forgetting is definitely a good strategy and would save you a lot of stress, but i don't think you will be able to forget about it.. more likely you will obsessively check the price many times a day
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:29:06
i have been wondering too.... there must be many people like me..or doing even better
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:01:13
Kraken for buying because of SEPA Euro transfers. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:40:15
Good idea
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:58:47
About 20 years older than you... so hopefully retire before 50 :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:50:38
i doubt fiat offers that amount of precision
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:42:33
i haven't changed my lifestyle yet and have a job. why stop now ? i could have stopped at $0.5M. The all or nothing strategy (which I can afford) paid out so far
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:36:07
true, but it i took a risk and put most of my savings in it
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:29:35
For the moment I live as before, work on my normal job living a very modest life. I will wait till i get one of these crypto spending credit cards and then spend a bit from time to time e.g. on nice vacations.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:21:09
when the price goes down over a prolonged time it is hard not to try to sell and buy in lower. i tried a couple of times with very small amounts just to see whether i can time the market, but usually was unsuccessful, so i never did it with significant amounts
