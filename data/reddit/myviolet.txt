they wanted to rename our bitcoin to bitcoin legacy and they also wanted to rename bitcoin cash to bitcoin! that is how evil they are!
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:15:01
bitcoin cash is just a pump and dump coin
dont touch it at any cost!

@_date: 2017-10-08 01:15:58
i have 24 seed keywords but i dont have and never see my private keys 
i am not sure how to create a private key from the 24 word recovery seed
i will Google it
i know you will need the private keys to access the BTC Gold after the fork
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:30:05
this is my question too!
i have btc on Trezor hardware wallet
i have 24 recovery seed
i never see the private keys
how will i access to the Bitcoin gold  after the hardware fork on 25 Oct ?
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:38:57
thanks for the response!
this is my own answer:
Recovery seed is a mnemonic code made of 12, 18 or 24 words depending on your choice. This seed is generated the first time you run TREZOR and will help you recovering it’s contents (private keys, bitcoin balance, and transaction history) into a new device if you lose your TREZOR.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:47:51
good summary!
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:36:06
it is certainly a scam and it is stealing the name of Bitcoin!
do everything in your power to dump this shit coin as soon as possible!
or else they will become the enemy of bitcoin
we need to tell the world about this scam, Korean is buying this shitcoin like crazy!!!
 because they don't know yet
spread the words to all countries that they should not buy this shitcoin any more
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:38:59
bite the bullet and buy now my friend!
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:43:15
i meant it will go all the way up to $10,000 then a small correction down to $9,000 to get some more investors that still sitting on the fence.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:29:45
