Get out of here with your logic and critical thinking.  That kind of stuff has no place in this subreddit!

That's like... 6 per city that actually has people who have heard of bitcoin in Canada!

Oh boy, hopefully they offer a 40% discount so it's actually worth buying from them instead of literally anywhere else and not having your wallet raped!

Too bad Riot was bought by Tencent, which is a Chinese company.

Serious?  If you are only getting a coffee (and maybe a donut) it definitely does not take anywhere close to a minute from the time that you step up to the register to the time that you walk back out the door.

Care to estimate how many ounces of gold (or dirt, or feathers) are in that bag of $1100 bitcoins you were left holding?

Unfortunately Tigerdirect.ca does not offer a discount for purchases in btc and they're pretty bad for pricing compared to Newegg and NCIX.  Sure, they might pricematch, but it's rare to actually find a better price with TD.  If you're going to place an order through TD then you might as well just pay in fiat and hodl your coins for the purchase protection and option of actually getting a refund vs store credit.  Price variations in btc (i.e. going to the moon) can be accounted for by rebuying your btc when you place the purchase, but you'll still be stuck with an awful returns policy.  
That being said, I did make my first bitcoin purchase with them because I wanted to transform magic internet money into real goods for the novelty factor and they had a 'sale' on something that brought it down to match Newegg/NCIX.

Criminals were the first ones to realize what bitcoin is about, mang.
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:48:06
There's a pretty good chance that they would make less money per hour by hitting faucets than sending out spam emails.  It would be a clever ruse.

Dropping one and hodling the rest would have been fine, but panic dropping his whole stash is something he might not even get to live to regret.

Life for Canadian bitcoiners is suffering.
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:52:03
I'm considering doing the same when my cheque comes in.  I would be more proactive about buying and using bitcoin if it were easier to spend them in Canada.
Perhaps I'm just not looking in the right places.
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:32:06
Still waiting for Newegg.ca and NCIX TO take bitcoin... Tiger Direct is pretty awful for prices on a lot of things, but I did make my first bitcoin purchase through them.

Hopefully this will give some leverage to push Beatport over...  They've been "considering" accepting bitcoin for a couple of years now.
