Where can I find any indication that Cardano is more than just another white paper?
You know, for the people who don't want to trust random Redditors when it comes to investing in trustless technology.

Agreed, it's very hard to get unbiased information on the scaling debate.

There are about a thousand different cryptocurrencies, last time I heard. They all have slightly different properties, serve different goals, can be used for different things. The best thing you can do is read, read, read, and try to find out what you think will be the next Facebook/Google of crypto. For example I'm invested in EOS, a cryptocurrency that aims to make a decentralized operating system - basically Windows on a blockchain. I've read the white paper, the roadmap, did some background research on the team behind it, looked at the code on Github, etc.

You can always invest in BTC. If you're in for the money, you will only make profit when the price of BTC rises after you invested. Since one BTC is currently about $4000 many people feel like they have missed the boat and can't invest anymore. However it's not the current price, it's the change in price after you invested that determines your profit. Do you think BTC is going to rise more? Then invest. Do you think BTC has reached it's top price? Then don't invest.
In the Bitcoin subs some people are actually suggesting to stop working with BTC and start working with mBTC (millibitcoin), which is 1/1000th of a BTC. While 1 BTC = $4000, 1 mBTC = $4 so people might not think it's so expensive. Of course this is just psychological and doesn't make any difference in reality. It's the same as saying "I have 6000 cents" instead of saying "I have 60 dollars". It's just a matter of units.

No, but you can buy 0.01 BTC or 0.001 or whatever amount you want. If in the future the Bitcoin price becomes crazy high, for example 10 million USD, then 0.00000001 BTC (which is called 1 Satoshi) would be 10 dollar cents - so if you buy groceries with BTC it might be easier to say you spend 300 Satoshis than to say you spend 0.000003 BTC.
Satoshis are basically to Bitcoin what cents are to the dollar - except that one dollar = 100 cents, and 1 BTC = 100 million Satoshis.
About the investment return: this is simply proportional to how much you invested. If you invest $1000 and you get 10% profit, you now have $1100. If you invested $1, you now have $1.10.

I agree that it probably won't be a problem. But just for the fun of it, imagine if you have to link your Github account to your Xbox Live account... Or if Github Linux compatibility stops... Or if Cortana is integrated into Github (whatever that means).

Bitching? Jesus Christ, chill. And no, it's in beta, it's still being developed and has been for 3 years. Do you know an exchange that accepts deposits with LN? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:29:08
About that... Remember when LN was going to come out within 6 months... in 2015.
And that's from the CEO and co-founder of Lightning Labs.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:06:46
Which exchanges?
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:25:47
No my point was that it takes a long time for something like LN to become big (although I don't doubt it will), and Reddit has been posting "LN is about to change the world" posts for years now.

Based on the fact that 99.99% of all open source projects are on Github. Linux, OpenOffice, Bitcoin, VLC, Chromium, if it's open source and you've heard of it, it's on Github.

Steemit is a social media platform based on blockchain tech and Bitshares is (although I don't know the details) a blockchain based decentralized exchange. The fact that people have used them for some time now and that they generate a lot of transactions already shows their use cases IMO.
I didn't say anything about EOS, infrastructure blockchains or investing. My only point was that it's a bit wrong to dismiss Dan Larimer as "the guy who create a new coin every second year" if his two projects have the most usage and users of (nearly?) all blockchain projects.
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:05:05
His projects generate more than half of all blockchain transactions. Contrary to most blockchain applications, his projects are actually used by people.

And people wonder why governments are cracking down on cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin has many advantages over traditional currencies, even for people who aren't tax evaders or money launderers.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:40:37
It's impossible for Bitcoin to die, because in the worst case, when everybody stops mining/using it, I'll personally buy a raspberry pi and set it to work to mine all the coins and process all the (nonexistent) transactions. The blockchain will continue.

Good point. The idea of Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust anybody for it to work, but in reality you still need to trust exchanges to play fair, give you the money you're entitled to, etc. However, good news, because decentralized exchanges are being developed. A decentralized exchange is basically nothing more than a piece of open source code that anybody can verify and reproduce, and that functions as an exchange when executed. Nobody owns it or makes money from it.* It's security is based on a blockchain, for example that of Bitcoin or Ethereum (see ethfinex.com). When decentralized exchanges start working people won't need to trust centralized exchanges anymore if they don't want to.
\* If the creator charges fees for use of the exchange, somebody else will copy the code, remove the fee part, launch a new exchange, and people will use that one because it's cheaper.

Thanks for this interesting post. Something that is still unclear to me is: what does the 2MB HF exactly do? If I understand correctly, SegWit scales blocksize up to max 4MB, depending on network conditions. What does the 2MB HF add to this?
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:49:47
That is because your account is not verified yet. Your verification tier is probably 0 or 1 and for fiat deposits/withdrawals you have to get it up to 2.

Cool, thanks!
