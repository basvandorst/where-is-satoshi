how am i butthurt? im trying to knock sense into you guys. just because the value and traffic is up isn’t necessarily a good thing. this is what im talking about. close minded idiots
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:39:07
more close minded idiots proving it here on a fucking meme of a subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:30:27
LOL and if you expect to use it as a international currency traffic isnt going to stay high??? the time it takes to transfer and the fees will only get worse with more knowledge of bitcoin. you literally just told yourself why you shouldnt be in bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:40:45
lmao here* fucking idiot. a knock off? do you even know what a fork is? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:43:14
lol if i bet against you you wouldn’t have the money to give me when btc crashes
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:13:16
So you’re upset that Core sucks and that BCH has become the real bitcoin? The bitcoin even Satoshi would support
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:07:41
it is. whats your defense into saying the fees aren’t ridiculous? please show me evidence
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:56:57
Bitcoin.com has ShapeShift incorporated into their app. Transfer your BTC to BCH!
