Go to the email bitinstant sent you and copy APIResponse code. Go to mtgox account, funding options, add funds, redeem mt gox code, and paste the code.

I guess I should have worded my point differently.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:57:54
The comments are cringe worthy.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:02:49
Oh... don't stress just yet. It's been a crazy cpl days. Do you still have your quote code in your history?
Edit: or in the email they sent. You should be able to check the status.

I would probably leave out the deepweb stuff.

Only thing holding this god forsaken currency together right now is the potheads on tor.

I may  be  in  denial  here,  but  I wouldn't consider  myself  a nerd.  I am a graphic designer,  but  don't  know  much  about programming or  networking.  The  extent  of  my  networking is  playing  around  with  a media  server in  my  home. I spend  more  time  playing  pick up basketball than  I do  most  other things.  I like Bitcoin,  because it's different. I have  always  like  things  that are slightly different than the norm.  I read  about Bitcoins in  Wired back in  2011 and  started using them shortly after. 
I guess I don't think Bitcoins are  simply a nerd currency...  but rather for the  alternative minded.  If  that  makes sense.

Has it been reliable for you? 
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:06:35
Take a look in your history... or check the email they sent. There should be a transaction id/ quote id. On their page (right above "pay to") in the corner... you can check your status.
Edit: I use Dwolla now, but I used to use Bitinstant... I always made it a errand that I did first. Then I would do grocery shopping or whatever... that way I wouldn't stress at monitor for an hour.

It's a lot stressful at times. I'm a huge NBA fan... and Android guy. I usually stay on the Android/Graphic Design/Basketball subs, but lately Bitcoin is tops. I have been keen on BTC since Wired did their article back in 2011, but never this much.
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:58:38
I was confused about this is also, since they changed numbers... so I just used my username.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:30:39
I know... I'm just impatient. I want to start accepting BTC more (I do accept BTC, but I don't push it) for my business. I'm bit fearful of these huge in(de)creases.

I would have stuck with Nexus. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:12:35
Can someone explain to me like I'm 5 what is happening here? Is this one person with some hack or is this a group of individuals just flooding?
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:33:46
Costa Rica it is.  I would hear more,  but I that's up to you. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:37:53
Where did you get a HTC One? I hadn't realized they were out yet.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:38:05
I notice the bitinstant transfer "your account is still the same, but we have new ones at the top of the mtgox page? Could this be an issue?
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:58:38
Yeah. I thought this was more of an "exchange" issue rather a problem with Bitcoin?

This is great! I spent my childhood in eastern KY. 
This is definitely a cleaner form of mining.

Do they even have a Holiday Inn Express in China?

Use your login name.

How long ago did this happen?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:40:46
Correct. With freedom you have the right to also make bad decisions, too.

Did you ever get your money?
