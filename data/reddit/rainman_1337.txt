Download Bitcoin Core. Be careful, you have to download the entire blockchain ~140GB.

"I've heard of this bitcoin thing but I don't know what it is. I guess I'll Google it. *tic-tak tic-tak* Hmm, it's a decentralized distributed cryptocurr- that's a lot of big words fuck that."

Tell people about bitcoin, don't tell people about YOUR bitcoin.

Why? Don't want to attract hackers stealing private keys?

Shouldn't have told them you have some until they do too. Tell people about Bitcoin, don't tell people about your Bitcoin.

First thing you gotta tell them is they don't have to buy a whole bitcoin.

Noob question. AFAIK, Segwit increases block size from 1MB to 2MB. Won't this cause the blockchain to grow too quickly making storage difficult for the average user? Only the rich who can afford large hard drives will be able to store the blockchain and act as nodes and miners. That's centralization and that's bad. Doesn't Segwit have the same problems as Bcash (bitcoin cash)?

I know what Bitcoin is, YOU FUCKING IDIOT. I don't know why the size of any random block is important.

Why is this relevant? What does it signify? What does this mean?

You don't recruit people. You don't get paid for recruiting people. Investors are never promised payment.

Tbf bitcoins don't exist, only satoshis. The 8 decimal places was abstract. IMO we need to start using smaller units.
