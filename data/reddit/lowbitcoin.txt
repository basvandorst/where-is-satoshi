Coinbase is fairly good, but not fast until you are verified.

Mine is jail broken. I'll see if I can figure it out.

Did you use the program I linked to or another way to add it to your phone?

There is no way for me to give you a reason to trust me, I just figured this out to transfer the app over to my roommates' phone and decided to post it here. 
For one I am not good at anything but research.
If you do not trust my file you can just grab it from a friend if they have it. Just make sure they copy the file after they have logged out of the app on their phone first.

Sorry not yet, I've been working 12 hour days. So I'll try to get to it this weekend and see if I can figure it out.

They didn't really say, but there are many threads about it and what people think is the reason.

Blockchain is just a wallet app to send and receive, it is not an exchange (like Coinbase) where you can buy/sell coins.

How would I go about removing the FairPlay part?

Too bad it probably won't work with bitcoins.
