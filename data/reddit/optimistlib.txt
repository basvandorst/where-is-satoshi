It doesn't matter what Satoshi thought. We don't worship a leader in a decentralized currency.  2mb HF may be done. But, I couldn't care less.I know for sure that it is not going to be helpful. Nobody will build the next killer app if he knows that we are only going to scale from the 4tps to ,say, 10 tps. The killer apps need to be convinced that the capacity will grow as required (millions of tps if required). They don't need on chain capacity, they just need transaction capacity

The 'rank' for your transaction is computed for each block and highest ranking transactions are included in the block. The 'rank' of your transaction depends on other transactions in the mempool. The mempool is not always uniformly full. It is a function of the time of the day, the frequency of blocks mined etc.

It's not unfinished. It is not yet implemented, that is it. We clearly know the security risks and it's just a matter of someone doing it. Please refer to the paper by rootstock

The changes will happen if they are easy. How hard is it to code a wallet to use another blockchain? It will be much harder to code to use LN because the knowledge and expertise do not exist. Sidechains can offload a lot of small value transactions from the main chain until we have a solid alternative solution. Sidechains can be the solution for most exchanges to keep verifiable and user controlled balances. This will bring in a  lot of transparency in exchanges
As say , it can be treated as your checkings account where I keep a few 100 dollars in sidechains for purchases etc.
Irrespective of whether we need to scale transactions or not, we need to have sidechains anyway. LN is a single purpose solution whereas a sidechain is a swiss army knife. Almost all the altcoins will die if there are sidechains, because every possible feature can be supported on a sidechain with little or no consensus.  Even on chain scaling is not as useful because we can't easily have new features on the main chain. Siechains are risky but if you compare it with the risk of alt coins gaining popularity because bitcoin can't provide enough features that risk is worth taking

Can CSV be used to implement better security?
Here is the requirement
 I should be able to send using 2 of 3 multisig and it should only be spendable after 'n' blocks. I should be able to send a 3 of 3 multisig to override the first txn to another address.  This way I can detect fraud and revert hacks

Did you go through the drivechain part?.It puts trust on miners. I'm more optimistic about that option.  Actually, it's possible to have a high level of security if significant no:of full nodes are aware of the other chains. Any attempt to steal coins might might just lead to rejection of blocks. This can keep the miners honest.

You are thinking of only one solution because of lack of imagination. The problem you have is the classic XY problem. You want X and you think only Y is the solution.  It is not bike shedding. You are just barking up the wrong ��
Think harder, what do you need? You just need transaction capacity, you really don't care how it is achieved. On chain scaling idea is �� oil. In reality we need 100's of millions of transactions every second. Do you want to record every tip for every comment on reddit to be recorded in the main chain forever? Do you really care? We need a bunch of off chain solutions that can accommodate tips for every page view, every email, every Wifi access or every file download in the internet.

@_date: 2016-04-20 08:47:43
Sure, it does. For a certain use case. Side chains work perfectly for most and it scales transactions and users without adding too much data to the main chain. If LN can bring in 10x scale, sidechains can bring in 1000x or more

Unlike Venmo UPI is a protocol any payment processor can implement. The advantage is that it offers level playing field and drives down the cost and complexity of payments dramatically.

A sidechain with zero-confirmation promises can be good enough for most use cases. If the block size of the side chain is large enough and block interval is small enough and if it never allows double spend by RBF or something, the merchant will be happy to accept zero-conf txns. That is as good as your LN
@_date: 2016-04-19 16:37:06
Sidechains have advantages. It could have a block interval in seconds and a very large blocksizes too. It may implement other novel ways of securing the blockchain. It is simple and easy to understand for the user

Rootstock is planning to have a sidechain which they call a drivechain. This is a reasonably safe option compared to federated sidechains which could be compromised

it depends on how many transactions a user performs on each channel.

Folks, if you have any serious amount of money in bitcoin, please don't store it in your smartphone, laptop etc. Move it to a cold storage (paper wallet, hardware wallet etc). You are even better off storing them on a web wallet like coinbase. But never on your smartphone or your PC, never. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 05:17:50
LN is limited by the number of channels you are able to open and close on main chain. That is limited by blocksize. If you want to scale this payment network to 100's of millions of users, LN itself is not enough
@_date: 2015-12-16 09:10:57
The advantage bitcoin has over the banks is totally overlooked.
If I send you money via a bank , you usually end up getting 20% to 60% less depending on the country that you reside. That is the tax you need to pay your govt because the banks are nothing but tax collection arms of the governments. Add to that the cost of managing your accounts and cost of remittances and working around capital controls. 
This is the real advantage that bitcoin (or any altcoin) has and any bank controlled network will not be able to eliminate these costs. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:48:48

No , you are wrong . Value of bitcoin goes up when people hold bitcoin not when they spend it. So, if a person uses a shift card he is holding bitcoin till the moment he moment he spends it.

When I said "decided by exchanges" I meant the exchange+its users.  Exchanges would gladly offer non custodial solutions if it were possible to do instant transactions such as LN. But, unfortunately, it doesn't yet. If you take a look at the recent blocks you see most of them full. If these exchanges and many other off-chain solutions didn't exist, bitcoin would have failed already
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:46:55
Stopping the war is probably not the objective, solving the problem at hand is more important. We have large mempools already and other scalability solutions in the works. All said and done , eventually, the blocks should be greater than 2MB is something everyone agrees upon. So why not go to 2MB right now and focus on the real solutions
@_date: 2015-12-08 07:33:32
I don't think the ability to vote for block size is going to be a good enough incentive for someone to do solo mine. Miners are profit driven. Most miners are not savvy enough to decide upon the merits or demerits of a technological solution. It will be disastrous if you entrust them with this new power. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 12:49:06

Do you mean the network will be healthy at 1GB blocks? I never said the objective should be to keep the block size small. It should be to keep as big as possible and maintain the properties of the network as intended by the creators. Keeping it running without disruptions is more important than accommodating more txns.

@_date: 2015-12-30 04:02:24
Actually, off chain txns help bitcoin. It increases the value of a bitcoin (the token) without putting a burden on the Bitcoin the network. We need to know that if every transaction is recorded in the blockchain it becomes extremely expensive for full nodes to validate blocks and that will lead to reduction in the number of full nodes which reduces the security of the network

agree with you. When billions of dollars are exchanged over blockchain, it is unlikely that the banks would want some more predictability of the system. They would not want somebody to hijack the old system when they can spend a few million dollars and do the mining themselves
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:34:10
Does that mean that the blocksize can go to infinity if there is demand? If that is the case why not remove the blocksize limit altogether and just let the miners decide
The reason why a lot of developers are opposing a limit hike is because higher size is risky, not because of lack of demand
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:19:05

I don't think the fidelity usecase would have been good for bitcoin. They just wanted to abuse the main blockchain for something totally unrelated
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:57:39
To raise the blocksize , we should experiment and learn the real world impact of bigger blocks.If I were stress testing a mission critical software , I would raise the load slowly and monitor the system for its health. The best bet is to go with option 5. Slowly increase the  size by X% every few months and constantly monitor the system. How about 10% increase every 3 months ?

The point is people never used to buy small items (even sub 1$ purchases) exchanging property before bitcoin. So, it was never a problem for people when they file returns. I'm sure almost no one would have reported a sub 100$ cap gain when they exchanged it for another consumable good  (like a dinner or a bus ride ) in the past because it was not practical.

Bitcoin has to be used where it is useful to users
* Trying to use it as a store of wealth for poor people is risky a currency which can fall 20% or more a day is not really a store of wealth. But it can be a valuable investment vehicle for a wealthy speculator who has  
* Transactions within the the same currency area is not a useful usecase. Usually there are much cheaper , simpler, safer ways to do so. Target people who need to move money across different currencies. That too where spread is high. One such area would be all those people who sell stuff from china. If I want to buy something in kenya from a chinese supplier, it probably is a very good way to send money. For that to happen, it has to be easy/cheap for the kenyan to acquire bitcoin. ATM is not the answer

Focus the aspects such as of how it can support journalism , indie music, short films and other content makers. Talk about how charities and churches can be helped using bitcoin donations . These are the conversations I wish this community will focus on. The more we discuss about overthrowing governments or other powerful establishments you will get vested interests targeting you.

Not really.
If you are in a country where it is easy to buy from exchanges, people would not go through the pain of dealing with a stranger. 
Then , whatever sales that happen per to peer must be by people who wish to have the trade anonymously . They would sell it slightly cheaper

In future I expect most of the small transactions to take place off-blockchain because
 * People want immediate confirmation 
 * The scalability issue may not be addressed before bitcoin adoption grows. With off-chain transactions I can scale to an infinite no:of tx per second
 * As bitcoin becomes more valuable , the transaction fees would be significant %age for a sub 5USD transactions
 *Off block-chain transactions can use every simple identifiable names such as email/url etc and are less prone to errors
 * A transaction in a blockchain is going to be replicated across the network and is going to live there for a long time to come. You would not want the blockchain to be polluted with such tiny inconsequential transactions
Nobody will have problem in trusting a third party with less than 100USD of pocket change for day to day spending.

There are other currencies in the world like Japanese yen where 1JPY= ~20ubit . So it depends on your frame of reference . The point is, bitcoin being a global currency, it should be able to represent the lowest value anywhere in the world without using decimals

I wouldn't really say it is 'painful' . But , the fact is that it involves trusting a person instead of a well known company. For a person who is a casual investor, it is more complex than say using coinbase .

It is not the same. The problem with fiat is 
* can't store it at home w/o losing significant percentage to inflation every year
* can't send to people remotely
* can't send exact amount without keeping a lot of small change with you
* spent significan't amount of time counting and checking for counterfeits
These problems don't exist w/ crypro currencies. So, the crypto banks will have to do much more work to convince you to keep your money there instead of a paper wallet.

The price is the representative the value people offer to bitcoin and that is the biggest strength of a currency .

u r right. Most of the migrants can't handle bitcoin directly. They are not educated enough and they can't take the risk of losing their money for doing it wrong. However the rich people who send large amounts can use it to shave of a few percentage points on exchange rate , but is it still worth it? The other problem is forex remittance (through remittance channels) is tax free in the country it is received. If I buy bitcoin in Dubai and sell in India it is taxable as income in my hand. Now who wants to take that risk
@_date: 2014-06-21 12:37:55
Now coinbase should introduce a a marketplace where I can buy and sell coins ( like localbitcoins ) . The point is , outside of US there is no way for you to get coins into your coinbase account.

I upvote this.  . If it is a few satoshis it should not be more than 5 years . 100 years is too much it should be much lower , say 25  to 40 years and the coins should be slowly released to miners by extending the current block reward by a few blocks . For example, instead of halving the block reward in 2016, extend it by a few more blocks till all the 'expired' coins are alotted to miners .This way bitcoin will always have 21million units

I don't think it is required to have a hot wallet hardware. A single wallet should be just fine. The suggestion I have is 
* Make a really secure wallet which stores the coins
* Provide a micro SD card slot to do backup/restore
* Provide a QR code scanner
* Use bluetooth connectivity to just connect your smart phone to the cold wallet . This can be used to periodically connect to the network to update the balances in your accounts.
* The device should be able to send a signed transaction using bluetooth to the network 
* Also include a software to generate key pairs in the wallet
* No transaction should happen without the user interaction which involves entering a password

* They contacted this developer and entered into an agreement where he just hands over his developer credentials to coinbase

* Once the app becomes popular coinbase would just hire the developer and say this is the official app

You missed one important point . In fiat currency all the productivity growth in the economy accrues to the issuer of the currency. It also give the currency issuer to save money from the savers.
Bitcoin rewards the savers  the currency instead of the issuer of the government. 
You are looking at a narrow use case of a person using USD/EUR as currency and somebody who has credit worthiness to acquire a credit card
If your currency is not a popular one , the spread is quite large. Most people in third world countries can't get a credit card or a bank account.
The other problem is capital controls which exist in the third world countries. It makes it extremely difficult to acquire/send forex for normal people
You are ignoring Cyprus like situations as some black swan event.mIt can happen just about anytime in your country. The govt can confiscate your money easily if you store it in Banks

I don't think one needs to be afraid of any one company to screw bitcoin. The need of the hour is market penetration. Bitcoin needs to reach at least 1% of US population before it can even become relevant and stable. For that we need to simplify bitcoin a bit like coinbase (or even circle) has done it. Once people own some coins it will be easier for most them to learn and move the coins to a personal wallet
Believe me, the bitcoin revolution will not be happening in US, it will start in some third world , latin american or african country where it can completely devour their fiat currency . Whatever people say , bitcoin cannot become stable without a reasonable market cap and that will have to happen by the first world people investing and hoarding bitcoin

The problem is when people compare bitcoin to Paypal, credit card bank etc to bitcoin. Whereas the ideal compoarison is with the dollar. 
The features of consumer protection, swipe to pay , NFCetc are not features of the dollar. These are services built on top of the dollar.
It's true that these services are not yet there or they are in the early stages for bitcoin. But then, bitcoin has  not been in retail shopping for more than probably 6-12 months. Give it some time and these services will get built.
People keep complaining about time taken for transactions. I predict that most of the future retail transactions will be done off-blockchain .They will happen instantaneously  and free . coinbase is an example. A coinbase to coinbase transaction can be done w/o waiting for transaction confirmation. There are many more who will come up. Imagine they forming a trust network and payment between them also will become off-blockchain. And nobody will use the blockchain to transfer 10$ just the way you may not use a bank for transferring 10$.
The point is , if people expected the bitcoin protocol to have all these features they are just silly.The beauty of the protocol is that it is solving the hard problems and keeping it simple.

Think of a usecase.
I am a multibillionaire who keeps all the money in a vault at home. When I go out to party I just take a few thousands an  and keep it in my pocket . The idea is I'm most likely to spend that money in the short term or I'm likely to lose it to pick pockets. But, I'm willing to take the risk because I need the convenience of spending instead of writing a check for everyone
It's same for services like coinbase. I can keep a few hundred dollars worth coins there and spend conveniently and quickly. I may lose some anonymity, but I may be fine with it.The chance of somebody picking my pocket or me forgetting the wallet somewhere is far higher than coinbase running away with my money . So the risk is much lower here.

You are mistaken if you think every transaction must go through the blockchain. If you use a coinbase account and send a few milltibits to another coinbase account nothing is recorded in the blockchain. bitcoin as a transaction medium and bitcoin as a representation of value are two different things. 
Imagine another service provider like coinbase comes up , and they can have an agreement with each other to settle the transactions between each other without going through the blockchain. So,bitcoin can scale without the blockchain scaling at all

What is the meaning of a cheap crypto currency? The intrinsic value of a cryptocurrency is zero. So looking from that PoV every crypto is insanely expensive. If you think that the value is derived from the demand for that currency then only bitcoin is really worth it. The alt coins will be only valuable if BTC has a real flaw or the other one has a big advantage . Sorry, cheap is not an advantage in case of currencies. No one says Pakistan rupee is cheaper than USD so it is better to get Pakistan Rupee instead of USD

On point  , when people say bitcoin should be hidden from the view, it is not about the risk, it's about the complexity of the technology.

The blockchain is not a real time transaction processing system . It is a ledger for proof of ownership. It supports transfer of ownership and that does not mean we should use it for all transfers of ownership. When you use a credit card , no dollars are transferred , they settle it in batches eventually . So a off-blockchain system is not much different from the current system. What if you use a credit card backed by bitcoin? do you really need transaction to happen on the blockchain? You have already handed over the keys to the credit card company so why bother with the blockchain at all? 
I expect several web wallets across the world offering various levels of privacy and security and I expect transactions between these entities to happen off-blockchain

Blockchain avoids the need to have trust in 3rd parties, but that does not mean people will stop trusting completely. We can trust third parties and bitcoin lets me decide how much do I trust a third party. It can be 10$ or 10000$ . But it is completely upto me.

The govt can buy some bitcoins (say 1 million BTC over some time) with it's own money/debt . After it has a big enough stash, just say that bitcoin is a valid currency for all/any payments , including taxes. People will start exchanging their fiat for bitcoins . This would cause the price of bitcoins to go up w.r.t the local currency. At that point the govt can slowly sell their bitcoins for the local currency and  demonetize whatever they have bought. I guess in the end both the government and the people would end up wealthier

You are willing to risk what? the risk of changing the nature of the system? The most important feature of the system is that it is a consensus system. I'm not exactly worried about the size of the block. There is a roadmap improving the system capacity. I would rather wait for quality software to be built and to build consensus. It does not matter if the blocks are full for  a few months (BTW txn backlog is not alarming or anything). Even if you raise the block size to 2MB it will be consumed up pretty soon.  It matters a lot to me whether the system still is a consensus system or not. If it is not, then this not bitcoin. Assigning arbitrary monetary value to an electronic token requires faith. If faith is lost then it is not valuable anymore. 
Was the block size changed? It was during the first year or so . Who are you to say there was no consensus? Was there any opposition to the change? I'm not aware of it. But today there is a lot of contention. 
I don't even think the block size is the issue. A bunch of malicious actors want to take control of the system or they are trying to break the system. 
As a developer in a serious OSS project I understand how hard it is to build software. It is very important to have competent people in charge of the project. I would trust the people who delivered stuff.

I'm totally for bigger blocksize (2-4 MB). That is not because the blockchain should be able to accommodate all micro txns, it is because it is OK to do so without hurting the network
That solution doesn't exist. Yes, but if you ever have to make it work it cannot be on the main chain. Do you mean to suggest that we should bump up the block size to 100MB now for your micro transactions and bring it down when these optimized solutions are available? As a stop gap arrangement use something like changetip. No heavens are gonna fall if your penny transactions are not recorded on the main chain till the end of time.

You are interested in bitcoin growing fast. I can understand that. But it cannot be done by compromising the system. I don't care if microsoft accepts bitcoin or not. That is not the problem bitcoin is trying to solve. Bitcoin has to prove that it can stay true to its promise. Staying censorship resistant and being a consensus system matters a lot. You trust coinbase. I want a system where I don't have to trust anybody. That is what bitcoin should be. A blockchain will be a settlement layer. It is not fast or convenient enough for most of the payment needs. Focus on innovation, and focus on the real promise of bitcoin.

awesome . 2000 bits 
There is another avenue , where tipping and micro payments for content which is currently impossible with the current credit card based system.
Another useful application is companies tipping/bribing users with bitcoins for actions such as sharing , commenting, advertising  etc. This is one overlooked application and this can overcome the bitcoin acquisition problem to a certain extent
As you said , brick and mortar merchant adoption is should be the last stage of the bitcoin story

Make it batched by default. batching can be done in every 10 txns or 12 hrs (whichever happens first) . Use an 'instant' keyword to relay the txn immediately .

For instance, if you are making a payment for a flight ticket, the airline would confirm your ticket only after a couple of confirmations. If the blocks are full and the transaction is not going through you should have the choice of adding a higher fee and get it into the next block. Is it allowed to change addresses in RBF, I'm not sure
@_date: 2016-01-03 18:00:26
miners have a lot of money at stake. If miners see that a majority of miner shave moved to a fork, they would upgrade too. They may not mine bigger blocks, but they would set their node to to accept bigger blocks because they wouldn't want to be left out. Full nodes are very easy to be replaced. But exchanges are important, they decide if the coins you mined are indeed valid
@_date: 2016-03-11 05:42:16
if your currency is small, you have huge risks of speculative attacks. anchoring your unit to bigger currencies is better. In case of bitcoin it is not BIG but because the supply is limited, you can easily protect yourself by having x% of your total supply. Barbados will be able to buy up 1% of total bitcoin supply and they would not feel the pinch.

There are a lot more things in bitcoin development other than just tweaking block size. There is a large space left for innovation. But, the problem is, the other team doesn't want anything other than a hard fork of the protocol.

Do you understand that what 2MB bump is not even going to help you scale. Yo will soon ask for a 4MB bump and so on. SegWit will give you more mileage . 
Real solutions do exist. you can use off-chain transactions using coinbase etc. I agree that it is not a desirable solution but it is better than mindlessly  bumping up blocksize

you miss the point. I said "if" they have 100% reserve. It's true that you cannot know if exchanges maintain 100% reserve. But it is possible for an exchange to prove that they have 100% reserve. Before bitcoin it was not possible.

I would say I'm for raising the block size to 2MB. But it is not gonna be enough. The system is going to need more than a simple block size increase. Without consensus we are going to create deep division and the system will collapse. My belief is, the block size will eventually go up, but not today 
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:55:56
OK, do you expect any serious full time developer to not be on the payroll of a company ? Who will feed his kids? I'm a developer in a serious open source project. I'm not dictated on what to build but it would be impossible for me to contribute without the money I get from the employer.

This reluctance to do hard forks will be bad for bitcoin. Let's accept the fact that hard forks will be required and it is better to get used to it.
Noone is opposed to segwit. But that does not mean blocksize should NOT be increased. If it is technically feasible, blocksize should be increased as much as possible

There are a lot of folks who are here to make a quick buck from bitcoin. They just do not understand anything about the system.

Why would anyone ask any question? Do you get asked any questions when you pay with a card?  The QR code /NFC protocol will have to carry the amount/bitcoin address today and tomorrow the protocol will accommodate more parameters. 
 
The wallet software will handle it without the cashier or user knowing it like the POS terminal handling everything automatically irrespective of the bank or issuing country/currency. There are very few people who would try to cheat the system and that is an acceptable risk. Even today there are enough chargebacks that the merchants are willing to accept.

A hard fork creates a network split right away. A softfork (in case of segwit) can split the chain only if a miner tries to steal coins. Even now, It's possible to split the chain if a miner tries to steal coins. A miner is risking 12.5 BTC just by trying to do it. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:11:15
Indians do not see currency devaluation as a problem. India is a very large country and people mostly buy and sell stuff within the borders. They will not adopt bitcoin because their currency is getting devalued (at the current rate). The Indian central bank would be the most reasonable and responsible central bank in the emerging markets. The only reason they will adopt bitcoin will be that it is a solid investment. 
In india, bank to bank transfers are essentially free and instantaneous. So bitcoin has no advantage there.

NO. A stock has an intrinsic value. That value is tied to the profits the company can generate. So, beyond a certain P/E it is a bubble and unsustainable. Bitcoin started off at zero and it has no optimal value. You can't say the price of a bitcoin has to be 'x' for it to be correctly priced

Bitcoin is not a democracy. It does not matter if the blocksize is 1MB or 2MB or 10MB. A non consensual hard fork is going to be disastrous. If you do not understand this, you do not understand cryptocurrency at all. Billions of dollars are invested into bitcoin because people believe the protocol is set in stone. If you can change anything by arm twisting , the writing is on the wall. Tomorrow you can change the block reward as well. If that happens, this experiment is over.

@_date: 2016-01-19 12:04:28
Even if there is a fork, both forks are compatible until one chain produces a block that is bigger than 1MB. Do not expect any miner to produce a block greater than 1MB even if they switch to classic. It is better to collect their block reward when bitcoin is worth something rather than when bitcoin is worthless
Don't think that there will be a fork and there will be two valuable coins . You may have a bitcoin worth pennies if you are lucky. Why would anyone buy a digital token when they don't have any guarantee of what it will look like.

You are probably not understanding this or you are just trying to be a dick. If a wallet does not support RBF, the transaction will be sent without RBF and the merchant has no problem. All these features are optional and as bitcoin matures it will add more features . Some users will use them and some will not.

For anything to happen, the change must be committed. After the code is checked in , it can be done in 6 months. It is important that the community get used to faster hard forks. If a fix for bug/vulnerability that threatens the system needs to be rolled out , there should be a precedence.

Using the main chain for 1$ txns is an overkill. We probably use an off-chain txn or a sidechain for that
@_date: 2016-03-30 07:38:37
It is. There is a limit to the amount of data that can be transmitted/validated between miners/nodes without seriously affecting decentralization. I'm not saying 1MB is that number. But, whatever it is, it is not a very large number. Bitcoin needs alternate solutions to be implemented (such as thin blocks) to improve upon that. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 07:56:40
They don't have to do all transactions on chain. They can use hosted wallets such as coinbase etc. It will be much faster and efficient compared to reinventing the wheel. This solves the problem of transaction delay and cost of transactions. This will help them convert their local currency units (bitcoin) to any fiat very easily

The problem with US companies is their US centric view of the world. In most parts of the world, customers do not do any recurring payment other than the most essential stuff because it is prone to misuse. For instance, in India, 95% of mobile users are prepaid. The good thing about the prepaid market is that you have infinite number of options to load money and it is push based. OTOH, for recurring billing you must have a credit card and that is a very small minority of customers. None of the big US businesses are willing to accept this fact and monetization is extremely low.

There are a lot of transactions which users could perform off chain. When the price becomes higher, some of them will go away. Also you can pack more into a transaction and make it more space efficient. So it is not true that price goes up and transaction volume stays where it is

Bitcoin has a use other than as an investment. It is a currency. You can use it for transactions. That way , higher the value of bitcoin more useful it is.

I would say accepting bitcoin in a brick and mortar store is hard with or without RBF. It is OK if it is a small shop where the owner sits at the counter and the patrons are bitcoin fans. Training employees to accept bitcoin is an exercise in futility. The problem is not with RBF, the problem is with the complexity of bitcoin itself.  Bitcoin will succeed only in online shopping where adding a payment mechanism doesn't mean extra training. Eventually , when there are universal payment mechanisms such a NFC where the protocol is rich enough to handle any kind of currency. 
If complexity was the criterion then bitcoin would have never gotten off the ground. 99.9% of the population will not understand it in the current form
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:47:41
This should be a part of the payment protocol itself. Most likely the cashier presents the user with a QR code which carries enough information for making the payment. The QR code can carry another flag which says "RBF=no" and the wallets should automatically know that the vendor would not accept RBF payments . In this case, the transaction is going to be smooth if the user is not trying to cheat the merchant

awesome writeup. Imagine it will have no negative impact on the network if the block size is 'x' MB (where x &gt;1). As software and infrastructure mature, 'x' will slide upwards and it would be possible to accommodate more in a block. How would we learn this?

USD is more vulnerable than say, Singapore dollars or Swiss francs. The number of people holding USD outside of U.S is huge. They have no compulsion to do so. If they lose confidence they can switch to another currency very easily because they don't pay their bills or taxes in USD. I would say every currency that is used overseas is more vulnerable than a currency that is purely local.
However I don't think people are likely to switch to bitcoin. But, it's possible that a small percentage of overseas USD holdings move to bitcoin as a hedge against a potential dollar devaluation.

Bitcoin does not have to appeal to 7 billion people for it to be successful.  Even if it is useful to 1% of the population as a means to protect their wealth, it is hugely successful.

Even if all coins move to rootstock, they are still UTXOs in the main chain. Basically, sidechain chain just trusts the main chain for issuing its tokens. One of the property of the main chain is block reward and the sidechain will never be able to issue a block reward. So mining will be profitable on the main chain as long as block reward is significant. After that point , when block rewards are negligible or non-existent, it is possible for a sidechain to take over the main chain

Over time software gets more complex. What is important is the added complexity is justified for the functionality added to the system. I have the following order of priority when adding software features. YMMV
 
* The feature should be required
* The design should be easily understood and convince the stakeholders
* The public API/interface for the feature should be simple and intuitive (it should not change later)
* Code should work correctly
* Code should be performant (if performance matters)
* Code should be simplified eventually
 
Yes, the code could be complex and it could always be made better. If the incentive is right enough people will learn the code

Ethereum is touted as the smart contracts platform. But what gives value to ethereum is not the smart contracts feature, it's the currency. Smart contracts is a topping which nobody cares about. There are no real smart contracts implementation yet.
Rootstock will be a sidechain and the damage to the system will be contained to that sidechain. Rooststock is not a currency play and they have no incentive to pump bitcoin the currency because they don't gain from it. Ethereum has this conflict of interest where they have a separate currency which they can profit from.

Your fees on LN could be in a few satoshis because the LN operator doesn't have huge overheads. It is even likely that some operator may offer free LN transactions.

As an added bonus, you get instant transactions and more privacy

Yes, sidechains are possible w/o modification to the protocol. 
sidechains (and other solutions) will help bitcoin scale to real world use cases, blocksize won't . According to me, sidechain is the only way for bitcoin to have new cool and potentially controversial features. Otherwise bitcoin code is eventually gonna stagnate and die. Every small code change is criticized by the community that nothing will ever get done. What we need is a few dozen sidechains built on top of the main chain catering to specific industry needs. One more micropayments , one for smart contracts etc.

When all exchanges have significantly brought down their fees to 0.5% or less you guys still stick to the 1% fee.

There are probably an order of magnitude more txns happening off-chain in the exchanges. So, we already have another solution. Just that it is sub-optimal

Most likely they want to issue assets there (colored coins may be). It is very difficult for a large business to rely on a project where code changes are extremely painful, if not impossible

sidechains are truly optional. Users of sidechains should decide whether waiting for 144 blocks is a problem or not. I'm sure there will be enough compelling reasons for people to be willing to wait. There can be users who would be willing to swap your coins instantly (shapeshift et al)


This space is totally new. Users are willing to keep their coins under the custody of exchanges (fully opaque and centralized) today. If a sidechain can offer you more transparency , that is a huge win. An year back there was no sidechain , you never know what you'll see next year.


If you are not a believer , you should get out of this space immediately. If there aren't enough innovations in this space bitcoin will die.


There WILL BE protocol changes. The community has the choice of accepting it or not. 


This can never be too sure. Do you care about bitcoin per se or do you care about your investments and innovation in this space?  Everyone agrees that without rapid innovation we are going nowhere. There will be more nimble players in this space who is out to eat the lunch of bitcoin. What if some alt coin kills bitcoin with better technology/features ?

The poor people have very little bargaining power. Currency devaluation leads to erosion of real wages.

You have no idea who will benefit (neither do I). But, believe me, there will be a lot of people who find it useful in almost any country. Actually, I find bitcoin quite useless in most of the developed world. They have well-developed financial systems. They don't pay 10% plus exchange fees to transfer money across borders. In those countries, bitcoin will not be used for buying groceries. It will be used as forex to circumvent capital controls  and to escape currency devaluation

You don't need to have the same rules in a sidechain. The changes could be
 
* Prune data older than 'x' months
* nodes do not need to be aware of a sidechain unless they accept transactions on that sidechain. 
* sidechains can use other protocols which may increase privacy or reduce storage
The possiblities are endless

It doesn't matter even if it is relevant to only 1% of the population. Bitcoin is a niche currency. It's not necessarily created for the poor. If you are here with a poverty eradication agenda, you will be disappointed. Bitcoin cannot help those who cannot help themselves. It's not there yet.

The problem is, bitcoin of today CAN'T do it at scale. The software and the technology are not designed to scale. So, until we have a proper solution, we stick with these suboptimal solutions. If you want your everyday morning coffee to go into the main chain, it is not possible today. 
 


Not really, it will help you understand the enormity of building something like this. If it is purely political, it doesn't matter whether you choose a donkey or an elephant. But in technical solutions who is chosen to do the stuff matters. Deep technical skills are hard to come by and they are at a premium. What I am saying is , you DON'T have an option of going with 2MB with a purely political solution. 


They are all suboptimal.


That is  a proprietary solution as well

I'm sure your don't understand why is a hard fork made difficult. If hard forks are mundane there is no guarantee of  21 million coin limit
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:03:21


NO, not at all. Even core doesn't get to decide what is the protocol. Every new release of core has to be compatible with every old release of core. Which means, the users can run any of those old versions and it should just work. So, if core chooses to make a hard fork, users can reject it by refusing to run the latest core.Even if a minority of users refuse to run it, it splits the network. So, ultimately, the user decides. However, core can introduce soft forks which can only be activated if miners and users deploy it. So, again, does core dictate the rules? no, not at all. Now, you want a single group (miners) to be able to dictate the rules.

I would recommend you to use different services for accepting BTC and then converting to USD.
You may use bitstamp or any exchange to accept bitcoin. Ensure that you use a new address everytime . 
Sell the coins  right away and the exchange would keep the money in USD. That way you can prevent any loss dues to price volatility. If you can pay your suppliers/employees or sell BTC for cash (localbitcoins etc) convert USD to BTC just in time and pay for stuff. 
That still leaves you with some BTC for which I don't have a good answer on how to get it to your bank
@_date: 2015-09-28 18:44:43

If you think internet access is available to only 1% of the people in emerging markets you are mistaken. Mobile internet growing extremely fast. To access a service like coinbase, you don't need very fast internet. All you need is a cheap android phone and a 2G connection is fine
Coinbase  is not just a broker for buying bitcoin if you can buy your bitcoins locally coinbase can be your wallet. Imagine the seller also using coinbase, then you can buy very small value bitcoins without paying txn fees and delays.
 
Normal bank is not an option if you wish to hold bitcoin. They only hold local fiat and imposes a lot of restrictions. If banks were great all over the world and fiat was trustworthy , then there is no use for bitcoin

You are assuming too many things here. If you are talking about software errors , that is possible with all the existing financial institutions today.
The blockchain and currency are 2 different things. I should be able to use one w/o the other. When I use a hosted wallet I'm using the currency without the blockchain. Everyone does not have to be as paranoid as you. 
Irrespective of what you prefer, most users will entrust their funds with an institution they can trust. There is nothing wrong with that. If billions of people can trust their personal data with google can they not trust a company with a few thousand dollars ?

Bitcoin may not be very stable compared to USD, EUR or the top 100 currencies. But, it is better  than a lot of currencies which inflate a lot and where capital controls prevent you from send/receive money abroad. There are places where the local currency is not at all useful beyond that geographic region

The internet connectivity thing does not even matter. An off-chain wallet can do an app that will do transactions over SMS. Internet penetration may be low, but mobile penetration is high.  
My question was about what are the available alternatives to coinbase.
@_date: 2015-09-28 12:53:47
OK , in your ideal world how do I spend my bitcoin other than selling it in exchanges. It's proven that merchants are not interested in accepting bitcoin as payments.

@_date: 2015-09-15 12:53:30
I don't think you got the requirement correctly.
The objective is to have a hosted bitcoin wallet (no need to convert to fiat or vice versa), which can send bitcoins peer to peer without going through the blockchain. The requirements are trustworthiness, ease of use (mobile app is a must) , few restrictions on txns 
I don't understand why are you talking about banks. BTW, Do you think a person in Nigeria will be able to open an account in BNP Paribas or JP Morgan
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:51:23
You are not getting the point.
99% of the population WILL NOT be able to use bitcoin blockchain directly. They don't have the technical knowhow or patience to deal with it. If there is a regulated service in US or Europe , there is a very little chance that you lose money . They may do fractional reserve , but you still don't use your coins
Using off-chain bitcoin is not same as using off chain YourNameCoin. The value of the off-chain bitcoin is exactly same as the value of on chain bitcoin (until there is a breach of trust). If you don't trust anybody it's a different matter. But most people do trust others and they will continue to do so

"If you want a hosted wallet anyone on earth can open, the answer is: there is none."
coinbase definitely does not stop anyone from creating a wallet
Imagine a small town/island in a third world country that wants to adopt bitcoin for small transactions where each transaction is a few dimes. The blockchain will not be able to even handle that volume nor will the users be able to afford the cost of doing it on chain. Add the inconvenience of waiting for confirmations.
The only possible solution as of now is using a hosted wallet and take up the risk of losing your small balance (may be 10s of dollars). The merchants who keep large balances can definitely move it to their own wallet if it crosses his threshold.
The location is hypothetical and it could be in a 3rd world country where their own currency is unstable.

@_date: 2016-10-29 02:22:49
It's very unlikely.

It's very easy to fix bugs in other information systems. In a functioning blockchain where 1000's of apps are running in parallel, making changes is extremely hard. It's totally posisble that a bug for a dapp is a feature for another. Ethereum is looking OK today because there are no mission critical stuff running there and the option of a HF is always there. As serious apps get deployed there it is going to be attacked more often and any fix would be much harder

I don't think it matters. There are 100s millions of people in India who can access internet already and it is obvious that they choose to do something else with their internet

@_date: 2015-09-24 13:19:43
Normal people are unlikely to use bitcoin directly. In that sense, these services are doing bitcoin a big favor by introducing this to folks who otherwise wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft pole. This offers a sanitized, safe and legal way for an average consumer to buy , spend and hold bitcoins.
Imagine a case where bitcoin value jumps quite a bit, all those folks will have the knowhow on how to invest in this asset because these services have educated them on bitcoin. If it is profitable enough, users will learn how to move it to their own private keys.
Another usecase is international remittance. They don't really care about bitcoins, they just need to send some money to someone in another country

People, in general, do not understand the dangers of a hard fork. Even if 2mb is ok, a hard fork to 2mb is going to set a few precedents.
1) what is the process of triggering one, this usually is political and can lead to ugly fights in the public
2) it also decides who is in charge of decision making to do a hard fork. This exposes individuals to unnecessary risk
3) hard forks can make fundamental changes to the rules by which bitcoin operates. This could lead to other compromises such can lead to loss of trust in the system
4) if there is a hard fork for 2mb, we will find ourselves on a similar situation a few months down the line. It's a slippery slope

It is not for the average consumer. Imagine you are an individual who has the option of accepting bitcoin as a payment. In that case your only choice today is to convert it into fiat and put it into your bank account. Which is an income and you pay upwards of 30% taxes in most countries. If your use a debit card, you may pay less than 3% charges. So you can offer a discount to those who pay in bitcoin. It also saves you a lot of paperwork too. When this is so easy you will find that there are more people who offer services in bitcoin and you will be able to bypass the card altogether and save the service charges as well. According to me, this is an extremely important service which can help bitcoin go mainstream

It is ridiculous if you keep parroting a line from a 9 year old whitepaper. The author of the system was not god. It is true that it can behave like cash at some scale.

Not every transaction is required to be performed. There are multiple possibilities
1) consolidate multiple txns into one. Instead of sending 5 transactions to withdraw your coins , you may just wait a bit longer and do a single transaction if it is expensive
2) use off-chain solutions like hosted wallets.They are not trustless. But, the fact that users already keep a large quantity of BTC with these hosted wallets and exchanges means they are OK with that risk. Those transactions are usually, off-chain, instant and free
3) Transactions between big players (say coinbase to bitpay) can happen off-chain. They can use payment channels or an offline settlement mechanism
4) Some transactions will move to other coins 
5) Eventually the industry will have solutions like LN or sidechains which will take some load off

In case of fiat money, the unit of account and store of value are rolled into one. That's why stability matters. Once you separate them out, it ceases to be a problem.

What he means is bitcoin is not supposed to be arbitrary. The system must have clear rules on what goes into a block. If the txn passes the test it must be added in that block and it is not a spam. It is the responsibility of devs to assign a proper score for each txn that penalizes "spam" transactions. If a human being can identify a "spam" txn a program too should be able to. Those txns should require a much higher fee compared to the other.

The average American has no savings. The Chinese save their money and they need to invest it somewhere. So, it's prudent to expect them to dominate the bitcoin. When it comes to mining, the Chinese are the ones who have the fabs and industrial capability.

Instead of criticizing this subreddit members why don't you go ahead and rebut the points in the original blog. You seem to be pimping ethereum a lot here.

if the code is public everybody can predictably determine the score of a transaction and if a miner does claims to use that algorithm it is verifiable by others.

Most people think that the price of bitcoin is held back by on chain capacity. Actually, they are all willing to do anything to make a quick Buck. They would their bitcoin under the bus just to make some money. Then there are people like Erik Vorhees whose exchange has a heavy dependency on on chain capacity.

Bitcoin and the price of bitcoin are two different things. I would actually trust a small guy who is actively trading bitcoin in exchanges than these so called 'experts'

If the Carribean govt's wish to deal with this problem, all they need to do it is treat bitcoin as a foreign currency and let trades happen there easily.This will lead to operators exchanging bitcoin and local currency and they will be alright.

It will be lending as it is supposed to be. You give your coins to a bitcoin bank and collect interest. The bank will issue this coins to borrowers and collect a higher interest. The only problem is that they will not be able to issue more loans than they have deposits.

WTF is a dapp, if the hard forks are going to reverse your code output?

I'm yet to see one real application of ethereum in the real world. I'll be glad to see the need for a 'flexible' cryptocurrency

Bitcoin is in Beta. But it IS CRITICAL. You don't get to make another bitcoin if this experiment fails. I would request you to go build another one instead of trying to screw this up.


What do you mean by that? it is growing.

I disagree with Andreas on his assessment of ethereum. Ethereum is around 80% premined and its current application is same as bitcoin. Today, it is just a currency. The smart contracts promise is far from being fulfilled. Imagine if they released ethereum without the smart contracts smoke and mirrors, people would call it a shitcoin and it would have gone down the tube. With a heavy concentration of tokens in a few hands, it's very easy to manipulate the price (it's rewarding too). Nobody would be talking about ethereum if the market cap is not 1 billion. They achieved it with a combination of market and media manipulation.

They will only be able to lend as many coins as they have in deposits. So, why would it be a problem. The borrowers will not accept IOUs.

Don't you know that ethereum has innovated to have fast confirmation times on an infinite blocksize chain. Yes, they are decentralized too. Man, they have invented the perpetual motion machine

They use Xapo so that they can accept bitcoin. They don't want to go through the pain of accepting bitcoin directly &amp; they wish to outsource that to somebody else .So, it is a direct endorsement.

Let me take  a stab at it. Bitcoin is not a traditional money where the value of money is more or less fixed. Imagine only 1000 bitcoins (100 billion satoshis) are available for transactions and the rest are kept in cold storage. What would happen? The value of each coin would go so high that each satoshi would be much more valuable. The transactions people perform would be more or less same value but with fewer satoshis. So, hodl happily.

Tech means too many things. If you have only seen social media startups, there is a huge world out there which you have not seen. Have you heard of software built for medical equipment, power plants, air traffic controllers etc where errors are a matter of life and death? You may not read about these in the media, but, believe me, you are thankful that they don't move fast and break things. But, they do exist and they do matter. Bitcoin is critical and every small change should be reviewed properly and I want that to be done by experts. If it is slow, it is not a bug, it is a feature.

If you can convert your money to Indian rupee and deposit money in Indian bank, you will be able to buy enough from localbitcoins

Yes, I'm a big fan of Andreas. His opinions are very balanced when it comes to bitcoin. He is an asset to the community.
@_date: 2016-07-11 16:08:57
People don't hodl all at same time. There will be at least one person who owns bitcoins who would need to buy something real (a house, a car etc). As the supply of bitcoins dry up, even a small portion of your bitcoins would buy you a house. So, there will be some supply available in the market. If all the coins are frozen, the economy would freeze up and the value of bitcoin would plummet. This means all those coins which were worth millions of dollars become worthless. So, it is against the interest of the hodler .

Dude, you don't seem to understand what bitcoin stands for. The consensus is to avoid hard fork
