Very good point! This is the exact discussion that needs to take place to move forward.  I was trying to create a simple premise to put an end to the hollow arguments that are put forth by people who are mad that they missed out rather than healthy criticism to debate actual weaknesses.  The point is kinda mute because if they hate it so much they won't set up a wallet.

but yet you feel the need to comment on a sub specific to bitcoin?  Don't be mad at yourself it isn't too late!

What is your argument?  I was speaking to those that troll masquerading inside of an argument not trolling for the sake of trolling.  The great thing about this premise is choice, we can chose who we argue with so if you want a response say something with substance or at the very least clever.

   as do I,  greater adoption will benefit everyone.

It isn't a foreign currency but that isn't my point you cannot sell securities, exchange/lend money without running into licensing requirements, banking and securities law it is a highly regulated industry.  Currency change desks aren't illegal but if you did it it would be without regulatory compliance. Crypt does currently fall outside of this scope but that still doesn't mean you can mint coins or run an exchange.  All current crypto exchanges are required to keep records and verfiy on their customers.  You trust a dollar bill because you trust the issuer.  Who issues a bitcoin coin?  If the key is on the face it can be spent before you get it making it not a very good product.  If it is embedded how would you verify with out destroying it?  You do prove a bill came from its minter in many ways and there are a lot of resources in place that keeps that in check (yet it is still a problem) who would be in charge of that for a bitcoin minter?  I am not saying it cannot be done just that there reasons no one is doing it that aren't because no one thought of it.

Because you need the money for crack or more bitcoin.

Look up E gold it was a digital currency backed by gold 20 years ago that failed for a verity of reasons a good case study for bitcoin.  I am bullish on bitcoin myself. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:59:01
but what if I need that crack... i mean bitcoin right now?

How is bitcoin not fungible? Fungible just means there is no differences between them.  If I borrow your bitcoin I dont have to return to you the same one \(fungible\) if I borrow your car you probably want the same one back \(not fungible\).

1) In the US it is illegal I forget the exact reason being a money transmitter without a licence or something.  Egold was shut down for similar reasons.  You can buy empty bitcoins on ebay for this reason as well.
2.)How would it be verified to be what it says it is?  If the key was stamped on the coin it would be spent if already circulation.  Greshams law bad money drives good money out of the market. 
3.) Straight up counterfeiting even if the source or minter was trusted how can you prove it came from them?
Fun fact the ridges on the coin are to prevent shaving rare metal from them that is why it isn't on the penny or nickle.

Very good point let me make a coin analogy.  We can agree that money or coins are fungible as a bank doesn't care which coins are returned when crediting your account and at the same time there are people that collect coins based on grade and date which isn't fungible.  There are even coins that exist that are illegal to own a 1933 20$ gold coin, a 1964 silver dollar for example.

Tether only real risk is exchange risk.
It isn't much different than a casino issuing chips to play.
Doesn't matter if they are holding cash against chips as much as it does that are open.  Money is flowing into crypto not out so even if it is a ponzi it works (at least for now).  Banks hold very little of depositors money rarely is that an issue.
