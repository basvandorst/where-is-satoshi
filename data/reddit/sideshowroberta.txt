Impulsive waves? Y'all realize that this is nothing more than Bistro Math. Swer to god, you're being trolled.

I wanna be retired in much less than that.

A paper wallet with private key, with copies at my mom's best friend's, and on a google drive somewhere is just a *little* safer than under the mattress.

Can I have 0,5 BTC?

Not without the private key, I don't

Protecting yourself, and being smart is the name of the game.

Folks, fuck!
Selling on the news is not panic selling. It was a prudent move. If the price continues upwards, we lose a few buck on the upside. On the other hand if it tanked, as so many thought it might on the news, and buy back at the dip, we're ahead.
It's like saying insurance is money thrown into the garbage.

Nothing wrong with paper wallets.

Similar to why Hodor's name is Hodor, in Game of Thrones.

So here's the thing.
I've held bitcoin for over three years, and have held since from when it was around $200. CAD, USD, doesn't matter - we were almost at par sometime back then.
I am an active equity trader (I know a thing or two about financial things) and certainly know Internet thingies. 
But after three years of reading and trying to figure things, I still cannot get my head around what to do *other* than hold my bit in the exchange account, from which I bought them.
S 'splain it like I'm 5? Ive read the sidebar info. Dunna make sense. It's all general and rather vague.

If you think that Business Insider is a legit news source (let alone a business source) then you deserve your trip to the moon. Without a helmet.

If you don't possess them, then you don't own them. ;)
But how does one go about exporting gold from China? That would be pretty hard, I imagine.

"Outrageous Predictions" indeed.




Here's an outrageous prediction for you... learn some math. Three times 900 is now.. 2100.

Sounds like a typical Market Economy, frankly. It's why we say there are limits to growth, and why economies cannot sustainable grow 4-5% a year in perpetuity.
OMG! The economy is a pyramid scheme.
