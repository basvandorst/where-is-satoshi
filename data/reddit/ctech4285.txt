Interesting, so with multi sig both parties have to agree to release funds or no one will get anything. Thats an irrevocable letter of credit.

almost no online store where i buy stuff from knew about bitcoins. and i think they will accept bitcoins if maybe 5% of there customers demand it
@_date: 2011-09-01 14:25:19

ebay auction?!
@_date: 2011-08-31 16:05:58
TLTR please
@_date: 2011-09-09 21:43:12
there are solutions...
the point was that we can push online retailers to use bitcoins..we just have to persistently write emails/make comments to all the online shops we do business with
@_date: 2011-09-16 01:25:52
same here, my client never continued downloading the block chain...if it's been more then 2h and you have a decent internet coneciton backup your wallet and reinstall your client
(asuming you have the coins acording to bitexplorer)
@_date: 2011-08-05 18:56:51

don't really care, i can always transfer them manually into usd to avoid the currency exchange risk...as long as those 260 to 60usd crashes don't happen too often
i don't want to have my customers going throw something like the paypal registration process brought you by fincen&amp;friends^tm
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:57:49
you probably want to hold the bitcoins for 3-7? days before giving them out for new or larger orders...oh and don't keep much money in your paypal account theyll frees it if they find out what you are doing
btw i'll buy some now send me a msg
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:22:57
we am thinking of setting up a bitcoin cash exchange here in nicaragua, banking regulations here are mostly coppied from the states in exchange for 'aid'. we have an office and a mtgox account it would be fairly easy to sell and buy bitcions for cash at our office....
would it still be consider a money transmitting business if i run it strictly to not make money?

We are a community that is known to respect free speech. freedom of speech is not there to protect "clean" speech.
also many cultures hold the believe of tolerance very high. tolerance means to tolerate not too like. i would rather criticize niggertown's comment for not contributing to the conversation with a down vote.

sweet, resting the blockchain worked!
thank you!!

i clocked in 2043 purchases on ebay in the last few years....and ebay is a pain in the ass...and its worse for merchants creating listing and managing it is just horrible....and then you have fees upwards 10% now depending how you count but they have products...fix that and make it super easy to import products from ebay or amazon and it will work...
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:14:42
decentralized p2p encryption based ebay/amazone type product feed/site
product information is kept on local clients served to whoever request the info. seller and buys can gain respect with feedback. 
think of it like bittorent+bitcoin where people can exchange goods and payment anonymously without fees (very small?)
eby+paypal fees: &gt;10%
ebay and paypal bullshit: priceless
just waiting for someone to write it up and post a kickstarter project.....
