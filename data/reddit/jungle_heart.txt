Greetings, I'll check out the atomic swapping concept. Thanks!

Well, I suppose it doesn't have to go to that extreme! lol. But just enough to handle Visa scale transactions for a region without changing the original Bitcoin code... Thoughts?

I suppose that bitcoin(city name) or bitcoin(family name) or bitcoin(personnel name), would not be adopted unless they were deemed useful by a critical mass of people...

Thanks for the response. Why do you think so?

Greetings, I don't think what I'm describing defeats Bitcoin's idea of a global, universal and generally accepted electronic currency.  A local version would not have to "exclude" anyone who wanted to participate. Rather, It would potentially be a faster network without having to scale the original bitcoin, if it was used and mined by a large and diverse group of people.  It's not that it would contradict "universality", it would just emphasize "locality".  Of course, anyone in the world could choose to mine, transact, or invest in any local version of bitcoin that they choose to.  There would actually be continuity of the spirit and fundamentals that makes Bitcoin what it is rather than having a bunch of scammy premined shitcoins with various names and promises all competing to be the first practical day to day digital cash.  I see what you mean about the times when European countries all had their own currencies and all of the problems and inconvenience surrounding that.  However, with cryptocurrency I imagine it's only going to get easier and easier to switch between coins.  One might also argue that the Euro, despite offering the convenience of a universal European currency, is a financial instrument of central banks which gains more and more power to manipulate the economy as it's circle of adoption increases.  Like the federal reserve and the dollar.

Hey freedombit, thanks for the thoughtful response. I don't necessarily think it has to be country dependent. For example "BitcoinCanada" could be used as a currency in Canada but not exclusive to Canadians or anyone else. Anyone in the world could use it or covert to it as they pleased if they needed to transact with Canadians​ or businesses in Canada. Of course they would not really be inclined or motivated to use that particular version of Bitcoin otherwise. It would be just as decentralized as original Bitcoin especially if it was mined by a diverse range of people. Thoughts?

Yes, I totally agree about the power that exists in a name.  And yes, they are very arbitrary, especially in crypto! As far as the example of "BitcoinCanada" goes, it could be just as decentralized as Bitcoin from a relative point of view. Yes, mostly Canadians would probably mine and transact with it, but it could still have the same "relative" level of distribution.  Of course, anyone anywhere would have the "choice" to participate, therefore the spirit of decentralization would still be there. Sort of like decentralization in a centralized local! After all, one might argue that Bitcoin is centralized to users here on Earth, lol :)  Your point about how names influence who uses it, is exactly what I'm getting at.  The continuity of the Bitcoin name which is becoming more and more known throughout the world.  Anyone who has heard of Bitcoin in Canada might be more likely to adopt their local version of "BitcoinCanada", since it has the name Bitcoin, rather than trusting some lesser know altcoin which may or may not be a premined centralized scam masquerading to be as good or better than Bitcoin.

"The philosophy that helps the most while hurting the least will have the strongest currency." 
I love this concept...
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:49:40
can you elaborate?

Excellent, will do. Thank you!
