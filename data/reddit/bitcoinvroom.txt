I got the exclusive package, premium package, multimedia package, sunroof and blind spot assist. And no, I don't believe they have any P31-esque packages...yet at least.

Not PR, just a thoroughly satisfied customer:)

For one, the dealership didn't even have to know what bitcoin was. The sales team sure didn't. And there wasn't much room for negotiating, there were only a few of the models left until June. 
And if the dealership had been open to negotiation, SnapCard could have easily made the invoices any price.

Buy anything with bitcoin!

Yep, these guys are great! I bought a car through them about a month ago too :)

Obviously you haven't used Snapcard ;)

Love it! I like that it is perched up high as you can still see the road out of your peripherals quite well. That's a deceptive shot, honestly. It looks a lot more proportional when you have the entire windshield in in the shot.

No, we had an arranged fee due to the price of the item. However, I believe their fee is only 1% now!

Go to joinsnapcard.com and buy a prepaid Kroger gift card. Or shell or Exxon. Whatever you want :)

Sorry, just wanted to share my experience in a comprehensive manner.

They are just a payment processor. A conduit for the purchase. They use their eBay accounts and their credit cards. Return policy is subject to the site the item was purchased on. They process the orders manually, from what I understand. But it wouldn't be farfetched for them to be using an automated system either, I can't really speak on their behalf from a technical aspect. 
I'm sure they'd be glad to answer any and all of your questions :)

1) you make your order
2) they buy the item for you (with their USD) and have it shipped to the address you specify
3) you send them the bitcoin (only AFTER the item has been ordered)
4) they liquidate your bitcoin
5) repeat
Just like that in that order. So there is never any risk to you :)

An extremely happy customer!

They were very intrigued. The people in the finance department had all heard of bitcoin before, so it was cool for them to see it actually being used to buy something tangible.
