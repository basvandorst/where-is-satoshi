Sure, but you also have to understand that companies like this operate over various communication channels.  Breaching an exchange might not have been the first step, the hacker might have gotten access to someone's email, or chat program, and gathered sensitive information until they had enough to break in.

Bitcoin does not have to be stable to be desirable. 
There are many other experiments out there that attempt to  optimize for stability.  But I'd argue that bitcoin can maintain it's attractiveness by being scarce and useful, then the price will rise.  
However, it must continuously compete against everything else to maintain it's utility. If bitcoin fails to innovate, then some other better more usable idea will dominate instead.  Be very afraid of stagnation, it can creep up on you until it's too late.  Let's hope bitcoin is more of the google chrome vs. internet explorer/microsoft edge or whatever they call it these days.

^ Bitcoin gets upgrades all the time
^ it's not uncommon for these changes to be backwards incompatible
@_date: 2016-04-24 01:38:02
I would argue that bitcoins first halving in late 2012 helped fuel the astronomical price rise that occurred in early 2013.  The halving doesn't change everything overnight, it takes time for the effects to set in.  Bitcoin became much more scarce as the supply lines ran dry in the weeks that followed.
I was trading on MtGox at the time and there simply weren't enough bitcoin for sale.  It was one of the biggest exchanges and the asks would just get gobbled up quickly because of the low price.
The exact same situation could happen again.  There is currently a given amount of buy pressure on the markets, but after the halving the supply side of that equation will decrease.

Dash nodes require proof of service in this manner.   Someone has to deposit 1000 units of the currency in a holding address and the node only operates while the funds are in that address.
You can't spoof holding btc at a particular address,  and if part of the reward fee is paid back to that address it doesn't matter who is the owner

@_date: 2018-01-13 21:00:38
Yeah, we agree on that.  Forget Bcash for a minute.  I'm not talking about that. 
Bitcoin has to make upgrades to itself every now and then.  When core releases a new client, everyone who wants to use bitcoin has to upgrade to that version or they're left in the dust.  I'm saying that the next time core releases a new version, they should make segwit transactions necessary to fix the fee problem.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:22:42
How long have you been in Bitcoin?  Bitcoin has gone through many non-contentious hard forks before without issue.  You take a popular update, tell everyone they NEED to update to continue using bitcoin, and set a date in the future where that happens.
Let me reiterate, this is not a foreign concept.  It's been done without problems many times before. 
 It's only a problem if the mandatory update is controversial and some significant amount of the economy doesn't want to go along with it. 
Enforcing Segwit is a no brainer.  Users, exchanges, and miners that use bitcoin today all want it.   It can be done

Damn, it seems Bitcoin has ongoing fee problems and without an immediate fix, this subreddit is just chasing down scapegoats.  Misdirected hostility is such a powerful tool of the manipulators. 
The fact that you've been brainwashed to believe they are the enemy is sad, but not surprising.  It's like there is a dedicated effort to encourage infighting and civil war hostility within the bitcoin community.
The real "enemies" of bitcoin are the people who want to control it or ban it, not the companies currently providing you access to it and bringing it to the rest of the world.  
All of the companies you've mentioned are operating with the bitcoin code that exists today, and they're actively trying to improve it.  Large exchanges and nodes already understand they can become major participants in the lightning network and help be the bridge to get fiat into decentralized exchanges/atomic swap architecture.  They're actively working towards those innovations. 
If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't really have time to try to convince you, sorry.

First of all, you're a bad friend for wanting to keep it secret from him.  
But it's your gift and you can choose what you want to do with it.   I'd recommend NOT breaking the seal and keeping the coin intact.  Unlike a bitcoin itself, the coin has collector's value and it's hold enough that it has value from every chain split token as well.

With a paper wallet, there really isn't a way to avoid fees. Not only do you pay a fee to load bitcoin onto the wallet, but if someone ever wants to redeem that wallet they have to pay another transaction fee too.  Be careful, because it's possible you are putting bitcoin into places that (at least for the foreseeable future) it can't be spent because the fee is too high for the amount. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:26:53

It's not *that* important because bitcoin as an idea stands on its own.  It's bigger than Satoshi himself because it belongs to all of the people who use it, and the legions of people who help mine/code/trade/debate/advocate for it.

I had most, but not all of my bitcoin in MtGox.  It just utterly sucked.  I was trying for weeks to get my BTC out of there but couldn't.  I was there the moment the trading engine finally went offline. 
Not much resolution has come out of it.  Supposedly they found 200,000 BTC and the creditors are entitled to some of that.  Kraken is apparently supposed to be helping with that there was a tie when we were allowed to file claims. 
There's a lot of victim-blaming in the aftermath of it too, people coming out and saying "Oh you deserved to lose your money"  
Nobody does.  Bitcoin itself is a better currency but the exchanges and other on-ramps still need improvement.  Decentralized exchanges need to happen.

Yes, those can be the outcomes of a capitalistic system run amok.  Awful isn't it?  Not sure what your ultimate point is though.  
Bitcoin is a commodity that's meant to be a store of value and medium of exchange, deflationary by design so that it increases in value over time.

Bitcoin is not a self sustaining system.  It's absolutely possible for bitcoin to be thrown into chaos by devs who push for a destabilizing change, regardless of intentions.

If you sent bitcoin to a particular address on your wallet, and other block explorers show that the transaction has already been broadcast and the bitcoin exist at that address, then you can be pretty certain the withdrawal was successful, it's just your bitcoin core wallet hasn't caught up yet.

When you send from an exchange, they can sometimes subsidize the transaction fee cost in order to incentivize you to use their service.  This is a business cost that they may change over time or make you pay for in another way. 
Exchanges may also bundle transactions to create more economical withdrawals.  
For everyone else however, sending bitcoin is currently very costly.  The average transaction fee is now over $40
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:44:23
Coinbase lets you buy and sell bitcoin in a few clicks at the current price.  Fees are higher but it's easier. 
Gdax is an exchange that lets you trade with other people who are buying and selling bitcoin, these trades make up an order book.   Fees are lower but it's slightly more complex to use
The two platforms are run by the same company so it's very easy to move funds between Coinbase and GDAX

It depends on where you're sitting.  Bitcoins have value in their scarcity.  So one someone dies without forwarding them to heirs or loses them through forgetting their keys, it makes everyone else's bitcoin more valuable. 
If the bitcoin price is basically a function of supply and demand, and coin loss reduces the available supply, then the price per coin will go up. 
The effect of such events is pretty negligible so far, because bitcoin is still experiencing ~10% inflation, but in the far future when only 1 BTC is mined per year, yes it might matter quite a bit if someone loses several BTC. 
There doesn't need to be a replacement or "redistribution" process, because bitcoins can be made infinitely divisible.  You could lose all but a handful of the 21 million, and it would still work as a store of value and medium of exchange, even globally.

You've got the argument backwards.  It's not so much that investors are waiting for bigger blocks, it's that current users fear what will happen if block sizes stay at their current artificially low (and somewhat arbitrary) limit. 
"Payments" are already happening, and if blocksize stays the same in a couple months transactions will become so clogged and backlogged that they will take hours to days just to confirm, and fees will go up to unacceptably high levels due to competition. 
If nothing is done, bitcoin could become inferior to other payment systems and cryptocurrencies, and would likely lose value as a result 
@_date: 2015-12-15 02:13:01
Coinbase has a good wallet app, if you forget your password, you can reset it online at their website.  Their wallet is called a *hosted* wallet because the bitcoins don't really exist on your phone, they exist at servers at Coinbase.com and you're trusting the company to store them. 
The wallet you used to have was probably this one: 
Unfortunately, the bitcoins in that type of wallet would only exist on your phone.  That means those bitcoins could be lost if your phone broke without a backup.

Miners do generate something that can be thought of as sell pressure, but the amount of this pressure is determined by multiplying the number of bitcoins created per day times and exchange rate value.
for instance, roughly 3600 bitcoins are created per day currently. Multiply that by the $400 exchange rate and the BTC network is only creating about 1.44 million worth of currency out of thin air daily.  If the total buy/sell pressure the world over exceeds this amount, then the price shifts upward as we run out of cheap bitcoins to sell

haha WOW you want to blame the "day traders and speculators" here?
Consider the fact that your BTC only has any relative worth at all because people are willing to exchange for it.  One very minor and not so important fact of that may *just* be related to the strength and quantity of bid support underneath a given price. 
Not all traders are bad people either.  Some of them work to stabilize the market rather than upset it.  In fact, you can probably thank a trader for making sure the market didn't get too high or too low too fast. 
Take your extremely bullish sentiment and rethink it.  Over a million bitcoin users just got burned in a loss of millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of bitcoin.  If you think this will all just blow over and you can mentally isolate yourself from the reality of this ever happening to you, you're dead wrong.

I admit I laughed, then I cried
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:52:59
This.  This right here is the crux of the perception problem. Some people believe a centralized mining network caused by big blocks is the more immediate threat, while others believe that a congested network caused by small blocks is a the bigger problem.
So while you may be correct that bitcoin depends on decentralization, it also depends on economic incentive to mine.
If the network capacity can't scale quickly enough, this forces more transactions off-chain using 3rd party solutions 
As the years go by, miners are increasingly dependent on these fees for block reward profit, but these fees will be diminished if the majority of transactions occur off chain through 3rd party solutions like the lightning network.
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:14:25
The classic brokerage buy allows people to lock in a price and get bitcoin using money that's in a bank,  not on the website.   Coinbase is essentially floating the money on these purchases to guarantee the rate.
The more people that use an exchange,  the harder it becomes for the operator to manipulate.  The more exchanges there are,  the less they can deviate in price without arbitrage taking over
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:15:42
Clearly, you're so amenable to objective evidence that you would be willing to provide an empirical risk analysis that shows bitcoin is in no danger from spiraling into a slow-confirmation high fee transfer network, should all block increases be put on hold until next year,  right?  
I feel like I need to see both sides of the argument to be sure
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:58:38
The crux of the argument to me, seems to be a disagreement over the magnitude of two problems:
Brian seems to think that bigger blocks will save us from network congestion at the risk of node centralization.
Some core devs seem to think that smaller blocks will save us from node centralization, at the risk of network congestion.
There are business interests on both sides, as many services benefit from a bigger, congestion-free network and miners benefit from higher fees.
I'd agree that everyone benefits from a more decentralized bitcoin, but no one benefits from a settlement system that is too slow and too costly to move funds. 
Network congestion seems like the more urgent problem to solve
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:20:43

@_date: 2016-03-16 14:25:03
While this is sound personal advice, it doesn't apply to everyone the same way. 
Some people have fiat or BTC sitting in exchange accounts filling up the order books, and they've done so for years without issue. 
For me,  it's about which exchanges are the most well funded,  which have FDIC insurance on US deposits and insurance on BTC deposits,  and which exchanges in the US who actually have their compliance in order and aren't liable to get shut down
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:19:33
Bitcoin would lose much of its value if it devolved into a $10 settlement network where fanciful centralized 3rd party solutions were needed to send transactions quickly and easily.  
It doesn't exist in a vacuum either.   If other crypto currency can do it more efficiently, then over time the bitcoin experiment will fail to gain traction and will just be replaced by something else. 
A congested, high fee network is not the kind of payment system I would choose to use if given options.  Even the mere idea that this problem is upcoming and avoidable but  the community at large can't move fast enough to solve it is enough to send the market into a tail spin
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:12:21
No, it doesn't.  $10 fees would be an artificial inflation of the market, propped up by an arbitrary low block size that couldn't accommodate the transaction capacity of the network.
It seems to be a major disagreement lately about how quickly congestion is becoming a problem

By the same standard, would reducing the block size, even drastically, do nothing to decrease the throughput of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:41:22
The interest rates bleed over to impact everything else.  They make it more expensive for banks to hold money, so they're more likely to lend it, which makes the amount of cash available for investments increase (bitcoin price goes up) and reduces the value of the currency (price goes up relative to it)
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:41:40
Can you please specify what exactly is the primary risk of bigger blocks, and the magnitude of this risk compared to a congested network? 
Because it seems to me that if the blocks are so full that transactionshe can't get confimed for hours, the network is functionally a lot less valuable and at risk of being replaced by something else. 
The full block problem seems both inevitable and avoidable, and it'd be a damn shame if it snuck up on us with our pants down
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:20:45
I'm not fine with leaving an arbitrary cap on the network capacity at all.   It keeps the number of on-chain transactions unnecessarily small,  and with fewer transactions there will be fewer fees.   In the years to come,  miners will be increasingly reliant on these fees for profit
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:31:57

I believe you would report a fraud claim to shift, who would then contact the merchant and report a fraudulent use of the card and issue a chargeback to refund your account.  The merchant would take the loss.

I'm assuming that over time bitcoin can become so popular that it's daily transaction volume exceeds the capacity of blocks to accommodate everyone's transfers.
Regardless of whether or not we debate about whether this is already happening, my argument assumes that this possibility can happen in the near future.   
So in order to understand your views plainly, I ask: do you think it's possible for bitcoin blocks to become so full that they can't process everyone's transactions in a timely manner?

It's sad too, really.  Checks can bounce, ACH and credit cards can charge back... the modern financial industry is fraught with payments that can be recalled even after the funds become available.
But the question remains, do you feel confident enough to identify the person did business with and sent these bitcoins to?  Bitcoins are irreversibly sent, like sending someone cash, or a commodity in the mail. 
In the future you could consider accepting irreversible forms of payment, like a bank wire or cash deposit.

I'm not going to pitch an altcoin here, but personally I did like the idea that some alts have implemented where running a node pays around 10% of the block/tx fee reward.  
It's a small fraction but it's not negligible and can add up over time.  In order to set up a node, you need to hold in reserve some amount of currency units (i.e. 100 BTC) for as long as the node is active, and then when a block is found a random selection algorithm picks one of the eligible nodes to distribute the reward to, independent of the payout to the mining pool. People can obviously set up as many nodes as they want to increase their odds, they just have to reserve currency each time. 
This creates an incentive to hold some of the currency in reserve (which drives up the price) and creates a real financial incentive to create nodes (which increases the health of the network) AND makes it prohibitively expensive for a 3rd party to set up a large number of nodes and attack the network. 
If miners want to complain about losing 10% of the block reward, the mere fact that so many nodes would be holding currency could drive up the price more than 10% and everyone's profit would be higher because of it.

It's a good question, I feel like he would be fairly unaware of the new technology and could be persuaded either way.  
If it was pitched as a valuable and revolutionary innovation that could transform and open up the financial industry by breaking up the power of the big banks, then he may take a more hands-off approach.
If it was pitched as a dark and shadowy instrument of subversion that enables off the books banking and literally funds every vice and sin under the sun, then he would be more hostile to it.

As the author recognizes, instant bitcoin purchases using a credit card and disclosing very little personal info seems like the holy grail for bitcoin brokers.  
But reversible credit card payments and irreversible bitcoin transfers just don't mix.  Circle's business model is going to get utterly ruined by people who take advantage of the system.  
Circle is only able to maintain this attempt for so long in a closed beta.  Once open to the public, they'll get grilled by credit card chargebacks so frequently that they'll either start cancelling certain purchases as risky, requiring more user info, or both.

There are other issues with increasing the blocksize. Quadratic hashing allows someone to create transactions that are more difficult to mine.  With a 1MB block size the max time to mine such a block would be about 10 minutes.  With a 2MB blocksize a quadratic hashing attack would be capable of producing blocks that take 100 minutes each to mine.   
Segwit solves this problem and allows for a safer block size increase

It's still an IOU, it might be provable that the funds are in the channel, but the funds are not yours until the channel closes and the settlement happens properly.  Under certain conditions, you could get screwed and lose all of your funds if you aren't paying attention and close the channel properly.  
You could have to wait an extremely long amount of time to get the funds anyway
You could be promised a payment, but then it's market value changes so drastically that it's amount exceeds the bandwidth of the channel so it's impossible to actually receive the value you expected and asked for in the first place. 
It's not a confirmed payment, it's an IOU that will settle later.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:09:08
A short is when someone borrows money (like bitcoin) to bet against the price of something, hoping it will go down.  If the price goes down, they pay back what they owe with less than they borrowed, keeping the remainder, effectively making more than what they started with.  It's the opposite of a long. 
You can't just borrow money for nothing, when someone opens a short position, they have to have some money to begin with.  If the value of the market moves too far up after you open a short, it will be clear that you can't pay back what you owe.  
Imagine borrowing 1 BTC, promising to repay it at $2000, but then the price goes up to $3000, it will be harder and harder for you to repay.  In order to avoid your balance going negative, the exchange may take your collateral balance and the money you borrowed back.  
A short squeeze is when this happens on a large scale.  Lots of volume is put into short positions, but then the market moves up instead.  This means all of the people who sold and hoped the price went down suddenly (and automatically) have to buy when the price goes too far up, which causes the price to go farther up

This [article]( estimates Satoshi's holdings at 1,148,800 BTC.  If you check the latest figures, Bill gates as a networth of 89.8 billion, so once bitcoin has reached a price of $78,168 USD/BTC, Satoshi could be probably be the richest man in the world.

I completely agree with the opinion that bitcoin should be cheap and accessible for anyone to transaction with.  It should not be limited to a high value settlement system.  
However, bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum.  There are other cryptocurrencies in this ecosystem that might be able to do small fee transactions better.  Or maybe someday bitcoin will fork and we'll end up with a high-volume version and a high-fee version.  
My point is, I really don't care if one or the other fails, because at the same time it's very likely that some other version will succeed.  Just keep yours eyes peeled for where the money is flowing.  And don't worry, it will probably be obvious because everyone around here is obsessed with the price.

Not that I disagree with you, but companies like Coinbase/Gemini/Circle have made it a point to stay in business by following the laws of the countries they operate in.  If they don't, they can't get banking partnerships to manage the fiat side. An exchange that can't get banking partnerships but is still "operating" is doing some seriously shady shit to stay in business.  
The exchanges that flout the law risk getting shut down, or are run by people who don't care about such things and are probably skirting other areas, like security/fraud/compliance/infrastructure/management.  Look at what happened to MtGox, Cryptsy, Mintpal, or Virtex, or [33 other exchanges that no longer exist](
When I choose an exchange to trade with, I care about their stability and endurance, I know full well that they have to play by someone's else's rules to create a bridge to a better tomorrow.

Price isn't the only measure of success.  
The total number of transactions in bitcoin is dropping from an all time high: 
The UTXO set size is stagnating: 
Fewer people are using bitcoin now than in months past.  If the trend continues and fees rise, more and more people will be "priced out" of the market and unable to move their coins in an economically feasible way.  
What good is any amount of bitcoin if you have to spend $100 to move it?

@_date: 2016-11-25 00:13:16
The problem with transaction fees right now isn't just the spot rate, they're also trending up over time.  It doesn't matter if you believe it's a "spam attack" or legitimate organic growth clogging up the network during a black friday weekend, the reality of the situation is still the same: bitcoin is slowly becoming less convenient.  
The fact that high fees _could_ be off-putting to anyone, let a lone a majority of users, prospective businesses, or app developers, should send a chill down the spine of anyone who's hoping bitcoin has long term prospects.  
If scaling doesn't keep up, we'll end up in a situation where bitcoin only has utility as a high value settlement network, which in my opinion isn't nearly as valuable as a global decentralized payment system.  Something else could come in to do it better/faster/cheaper but I would rather that be bitcoin first.

This is like asking everyone in a city not to use a toll road. Maybe you think toll roads suck (I sure do) and maybe you want to see a toll road replaced with a simple cheap and free road.  In theory if everyone decided not to use the toll road and dealt with a little more traffic, they'd be forced to make it cheaper or altogether free.  But in reality, there will always be some impatient folks willing to pay more to get there first.  They don't care about the macro scale, they are self-centered and focused on the micro-scale, or unaware of the implications.  
The fee market works the same way.  There will always be impatient people willing to pay more to get their transactions confirmed sooner.
I wouldn't blame the miners for being "greedy" either.  They are expected to operate in a trustless a manner that will beget them the most possible profit.  The rules of the game are currently engineered to favor a competitive fee market, and they're just abiding by them. 
The alternative school of thought says that miners can make more money if bitcoin becomes an ultra-high volume medium of exchange.  There are those that believe choking the number of eligible transactions and trying to squeeze every last penny out of the willing transactors is damaging to the network as a whole.  Instead, it's a better idea to engineer for more transaction capacity so that more people can use bitcoin simultaneously and quickly.

Not only would you have to trust the 1 or more miners to refund your money, but they'd also have to keep it a secret, and you'd have to disguise that the funds are feeding back into your own wallet (which admittedly is not that hard) ...but you're still ignoring the biggest problem of all: if you can't get 100% of the fees refunded, you're still bleeding funds constantly as your spam transactions get mined by non-participating miners

The situation in Greece is complex, but it is exacerbated by the fact that their government cannot issue more currency or adjust interest rates to deal with economic downturns.
The big open secret about modern warfare is that it happens in plain sight with no direct human casualties.  It is a transfer of wealth (and thus power) as the privelidged class of wealthy countries outsources their debt onto lesser nations.  
I'm not certain bitcoin would provide the ability to solve Greece's liquidity problem.  It's a classic bank run situation where everyone wants to get their money out at once,  and because of fractional reserve deposits not everyone will.   
Bitcoin can help protect assets from capital controls, but beyond that Greece has bigger problems that not even a new currency could fix overnight

I don't think that's the case at all.  I think the reality is that they're now realizing it's a good idea to separate exchanges from wallet services.  When apart they can specialize at doing what each does best, but bundled together each service will bog the other down.  
Bitcoin wallets thrive when the user controls their keys, that's what Coinbase recognizes.  Their bread and butter business model is being the on-ramp to bitcoin adoption but a true wallet service will be open sourced and controlled by no single point of failure.

Margin trading is where you start with some of your own money,  then borrow some more to make even larger trades.  If you go "long" then you have bought crypto hoping the price goes up.   If you go "short" then you have sold crypto hoping the price goes down. 
Margin trading is very risky because when the market moves in your direction you make more money,  but when it moves against you, you lose more money. 
If you lose so much there is a risk you can't pay back what you borrowed,  the exchange will automatically close your trade at a loss, which is what happened to people trying to go short this morning. 
When shorts close, they have to buy back the crypto they promised to pay back and the price goes up.  This can trigger more shorts to close too, and a domino effect known as a short squeeze happens where lots of shorts close at once and the price goes up a lot

It sounds like you're using money you're afraid to lose.  Investing is much more comfortable when you're using sums that are effectively inconsequential to your lifestyle, if lost.  
Why not just watch the market for a bit.  Look at how events play out and say "I would buy here" or "I would sell here" and then monitor how the value of your position would change over time.  If you feel comfortable with your test decisions, you can do it for real.  Some people open and close positions over a period of hours, this is difficult.   Other people open and close positions over days and weeks.  
Prices can change at any time and there is no guarantee to any direction.

You can also have incentived block rewards with more transactions paying a nominal fee, as opposed to fewer transactions paying the bulk of the fee.
An upper bound of $20 to "wire" funds might seem acceptable to some rich egghead but it prices so many people out of the market that bitcoin risks losing its market share to something else. 
There isn't a practical cap on the maximum possible fee either, so if left unchecked we will end up with transaction fees of $100 or more eventaully

Other alt coins have experimented with this idea. Dash coin for instance, gave 10% of the block reward to a randomly chosen node.   They also had an investment cost for setting up a node which was fairly significant.  The owner had to hold about $1000 worth of dash in that node. 
But they also had more frequent blocks.   In the end for bitcoin nodes could be paid by sharing a small fraction of the mining revenue or straight up small fees

A minority group of people in bitcoin are going to fork a new version of an altcoin, called "bitcoin cash."
If you have no interest in bitcoin cash (and many people don't) then you don't have to do anything.  Many exchanges temporarily are halting trading around that time to see how the new chains are formed. 
If before the fork you have bitcoin sitting in a wallet where you control the private keys, then when the fork happens you will have the same amounts of bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  They will not necessarily be worth the same. 
There are futures markets that are currently trying to work out the value of what Bitcoin cash will be, and the price consensus is around 1/8th the value of bitcoin: 
After the fork, the price of either currency could change rapidly

@_date: 2017-07-28 08:38:19
I'd say this is a plausible theory.  
1) Less coins on exchanges (at least for now) = less liquidity in the ask side of the order book. Less coins to sell = less resistance to the price going up.
2) there is also the incentive to buy bitcoin now so one can hold it on an offsite wallet during the fork, which means more people buying in general
But consider the after effects, an overinflated bitcoin price, a competing chain, and bunch of people with bitcoin instead of cash, it's the making of a situation ripe for a crash

This is a good question.  You would think since everyone knows about it,  the price is already accounting for the halving. 
But in reality,  the halving introduced scarcity.  Fewer bitcoins will be available to sell regardless.  The ask side of the order books on exchanges will run thin,  relative to the bid side.   This is a phenomenon that won't totally be understood until it happens.  It may take weeks or months for the normal supply to dry up,  but when it does the price will melt up to compensate

Your only hope at that point would be to install a program that recovers data on reformatted drives. 
Reformatting the drive tells the computer to "forget" where files are allocated, but actually cleaning/scrubing/wiping the data from a drive is a more time consuming process that standard formatting does not do, and most people don't bother with unless they *really* don't want sensitive data to be looked at. 
This is not trivial, the longer a drive is used after being formatted, the less likely it is that the original data can be recovered.

Look, I'm a big bitcoin believer but I have to take a crack at this "everything is fine" post.


I'm not convinced the market will correct to a friendly state.   Bitcoin has no design choices that select for a low or plausible cap on the fee, only an arbitrary 1 MB cap on the block size.  If nothing is done, bitcoin's userbase could fail to grow and fees could hover around the $10-$100 range.  


That's great that bitcoin is at an ATH, but if bitcoin can't be a global transaction network because fees are too high, what is it supposed to be, a secure store of value?   What happens when other coins reliably outperform bitcoin for months on end AND pay out a better mining reward per day?   


This is arguably already the case, but if Bitcoin doesn't pay the best returns to miners and holders, it won't be the most secure.  If it's not the most secure, some other store of value would have been a better choice.  
If some other coin has better trading volume, more diverse nodes, better long term yields, higher mining rewards, lower transaction fees, more network transactions, and a faster pace of innovation... then it's arguable that bitcoin has failed to be the best store of value.  It's like someone discovered digital platinum is worth more than digital gold.
Bitcoin is in a rough place.  The price might be rising but that's hardly a good thing considering it's unresolved scaling crisis.  The next best answer to that crisis, the User activated soft fork, is very much stalled ahead of it's August 1st deadline. 
Bitcoin will eventually undergo a hard fork.  It will be messy, maybe a clear winner of that will emerge and eventually be a better version of what we have now, but I see stormy seas ahead.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:35:41


Userbase growth and fee size can move independently of one another.  The price may very well continue to increase in spite of a smaller group of wealthy users holding the majority of coins in circulation.  Fees would not drop despite new user growth coming to stagnation.  
It's certainly possible that fees could drop as the total number of bitcoin transactions decreases, but this seems like a failure and a reduction of utility. 


Then why bother to comment on something you don't care about?  Some of us see a problem with the future of BTC and want to fix it before it gets worse.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:16:19
In it's current design, bitcoin has an arbitrary 1 MB cap on the maximum size per block.  There are/were good reasons for this, but it also means that as bitcoin usage grows, at some point were would no longer be able to accommodate all of the transactions in blocks.  This results in a bottleneck where only the higher paying transactions get in, the rest have to wait and may stay unconfirmed for quite a while. 
As the userbase and price of bitcoin grows, this problem gets worse.  Bitcoin would have to fundamentally change in order to accommodate higher transaction volumes. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:57:59
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:42:17
Bitcoin is currently going through an unresolved scaling crisis between groups of people who want limited transaction capacity (and thus high fees) and people who want increased transaction capacity (and thus low fees).
The current design of bitcoin is such that if nothing is done, fees will tend to increase over time, only limited as demand begins to drop off. 
So far, nothing substantial is being done.  The most recent proposal for change is a user-activated soft fork (called UASF 148 and 149) has failed to gain traction, only getting about 5-10% of nodes.  If it the proposal doesn't get substantial support by August 1st, 2017, bitcoin will remain the same and fees will likely continue to increase. 
If you want lower fees, use another cryptocurrency

I'm not upvoting this because I agree, upvoting for visibility.  It's looking increasingly likely that bitcoin is careening towards a hard fork split this August. 
* One version will be essentially unchanged, and keep the status quo of high fees.

This is an old essay that I wouldn't consider valid anymore.  One of the main arguments was "bitcoin will always hold more value than an appcoin can hold value."
While the original premise was tenuous at best, the author failed to consider that appcoins (now commonly called tokens) can have very different functions from the cryptocurrency they are tied to. 
Some of them are utter crap, don't get me wrong, but some of them are intriguing and could be useful.  I liken this to the dot com bubble, which saw a burst of innovation, hype, hysteria, and terrible ideas.  Some of the websites created around that time were revolutionary, some were profitable, some were both, and many were neither.  Seriously, who remembers: 
The ultimate point is, OP's title is only half true.  *Some* appcoins will be snake oil.  Some will be amazing and you (or the next generation) will be using them, just as you're using reddit now.

I don't think bitcoin will be valuable unless it can somehow process transactions under &lt;$100.  The average per capita income in India for instance, is $1,570.  There's no way in hell someone in a developing country is going to use the cryptocurrency if they're being asked to pay their daily wage as a fee to move money.

They're honestly very similar. You'll see merchant fees of 1% and 0.99% tossed around, so it's really up to you to determine who's got the more useful tools and ultimately who has the more professional and responsive customer support.  As someone who's worked with Coinbase before I can't fault them from a merchant standpoint.  They are also a bit more transparent about who they are and where they are located. (US based in San Francisco's financial hub) 
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:20:25
3 reasons:
1) Bitcoin, in it's current design, has no max cap on fees and in fact encourages unchecked fee growth.  As the price increases and more users use the network, it results in a transaction congestion bottleneck where only the highest paying members get their tx's confirmed.  One can easily imagine a scenario in the near future where tx's fees periodically rise to $10, $100, or more.  
2) People have predicted this kind of outcome for years, and proposed various ways to deal with it.  Some ideas are flawed (BU), some less flawed (segwit), but Bitcoin has lacked a coherent governance model and innovation has proceeded slowly.  The fee increases have changed the userbase of bitcoin however, so that the people who are most sensitive to transaction fees have already stopped using bitcoin and the only ones left are either complacent or conditioned to accept that transaction fees must be necessarily high.  Just like the parable of the boiling frog, we didn't get here overnight. 
3) To make matters worse, the miners controlling the majority of the hashpower have been hostile to increasing transaction capacity.  They are short-sighted and believe that higher fees mean more revenue for them.  While in the short term this is correct, in the long term this design choice harms the widespread utility of bitcoin and hurts mining rewards.  Public interest in digital currency will shift from the dominant bitcoin to other chains.  The BTC price will not rise as quickly, There are other digital currencies that exist today which already pay out a higher daily mining reward than bitcoin.  Because BTC has lost this incentive, it will only be a matter of time until other networks become secured by a greater proportion of hashpower. 
TL:DR you're paying $3 per transaction fee because of some greedy miners and soon you can expect to pay a lot more.

This article is almost inane.  
I'll try to break it down: 
Bitcoins come from the blockchain itself.  If someone finds a new block, the program is instructed to create a certain number of new coins as the very first transaction in that block.  It then transfer them (plus whatever transaction fees) to the miners address.   These new bitcoins are called coinbase.  Every bitcoin user in the world now recognizes the new coins as legitimate and spendable.

This is such an awesome idea.  A solar powered farmbot would be useful too.  
Just another thought here, to simplify things a bit more one could build a giant farmbot that rotates around in a big circle.
 It would only take 2 motors, one motor that orients the farmbot arm in a 360 arc and another presumably smaller motor that maneuvers the tool at at particular distance from the center.

* If someone gained a screen view of your computer when the 2-factor QR code was being generated
* If someone hijacked your session (generally very difficult, and much harder with HTTPs sites vs normal HTTP:  
* If someone was able to intercept and read your text messages 
* If someone correctly guessed your 2-factor code (not likely)

If you're located in the U.S. try partnering with Coinbase.  They've got a suite of nifty merchant tools, your customers can pay them BTC and they will forward you the USD pretty much same day, and the first 1 million $ in business is free, with 1% after that.  
Keep in mind that there are no chargebacks with BTC, so that as soon as a customer sends you the funds they're yours.  If you find yourself saving money on each customer that uses BTC, try to pass on a little of those savings to them and give 'em an incentive!

Honestly you're not at risk by sharing the public address, but it WILL attract attention.  My advice is the same.

The funny thing about the BTC community is that it started out very small.  It was easy to stereotype its homogenous members and lump them together in simple mischaracterizations. 
But over time as the community grows it will be harder and harder to identify the collective thought processes of the group.  We will become far more heterogeneous and far more diverse than we will at first care to admit.  
Some will attempt to evangelize beyond simple explanation but for the most part those efforts will be in vain.  Bitcoin is not a philosophy or a religion.  It is not a way of thinking and it does not require its followers to convert.  You can think its a good idea or a bad idea and still use it.  Bitcoin is simply a tool.

Provided that each person has a separate computer, you can each create a wallet that exists soley on that computer and store your bitcoins that way.  
If you want to do cold storage, simply use any number of wallet programs to print out the private keys for your bitcoin and store them in a manner that you find best.  
If there is only one computer in the house, each person could also each set up a web wallet with blockchain.info or coinbase.  Make sure to use 2 factor authentication with either authy or google authenticator 
If you're going to trade bitcoin online you can  each make your own account.  It doesn't need to be a group venture.

I saw this thing the other day 
Looks like the dude wanted to create a place where people can keep track of things they want to buy for bitcoin, and then it would calculate the total value for everyone so you could show it to the business as proof that they should be accepting it as a payment option. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:04:51
Without giving too many details here, do you have *any* information on the password?
Is it similar to other passwords you've created before?
Do you have any idea whether it is a shorter word or longer passphrase?
Any clues to the content of what's in the password (numbers, special characters, caps) Would you have categorically left out or included some of these types?
Your best bet is to have a trusted professional come in and run a hashcat or other type of password cracker.  Keyword is professional, you don't want someone to rip you off.

The short answer is yes it can, the long answer is that it never will.  Any adjustments to the 21 mil cap will immediately break the value of bitcoin.  It's better to continue as-is and see how the value of the existing bitcoins grow

If regulation comes at all, just remember it will be on a regional basis.  If the U.S. enacted much stricter legislation than other countries, then they would see bitcoin markets flock elsewhere (A fact that I think regulators are very aware of).

Depending on which exchange we use and the amounts involved, the price would jump up a certain amount.  How much?  Use the calculator tool at 
First put in a number in the "Amount to spend in USD" field.  It will tell you how many bitcoin that will purchase right there and then.  (Allow me to sigh for a moment, because I remember the days when bitcoin was in the teens) 
Once you get a ballpark figure of how many bitcoin you can purchase, look and see how deep the order book is.  The right column will be the "asks," or people willing to sell BTC at a certain price. 
Just by example, 1 million USD will buy about 7,500 BTC right now.  If done instantaneously, that would shoot up the price to just over 134.5.

This entire charade was triggered by two now-deleted tweets on weibo.  (see main post above)

There is no Dwolla service for MtGox (and frankly I'm not counting on it ever being a thing again) 
MtGox currently doesn't even have a feasible system for cash withdrawals.  I'm told if you actually have a Japanese bank account then maybe you're okay to withdraw.  You can also try to contact them and do a special withdraw for a horrendous 5% fee.  
But other than that, the only way to get anything out is bitcoin.  Translation?  Artificial scarcity, price inflation, and a huge amount of volatility.

This has happened a couple times before in the past.  I think the first time Bitstamp gets more 30 day volume will be a huuuge wake up call for both exchanges.  It's funny because as I write this, I'm transferring BTC out of Gox and it's not going back.

Whoever did this better be in it for the long term, because otherwise they are a total idiot and they lost tons due to slippage.  
Slowly making small purchases over the next few days not only would have stabilized the market, but established a 15,000 BTC + up-trend and the buyer would have consistently been able to purchase at prices in the $90's, capitalizing on any down turns.
Rough maths: in these market waters an instant 15,000 BTC purchase means you're losing about 1700 BTC due to slippage.  11% Ouch!

These central payment processors still want a cut of the action.  And if they're charging more than a few microbits per transaction (3% lol) to send money anywhere in the world within minutes, then they can't compete with bitcoin.

To be fair, CB is pretty good, but CampBX is one such exchange where you can dwolla deposit, and its based in the US

A couple of very interesting things happened, it all kind of has to do with bitcoin's internal properties.  
In the financial world, bitcoin is easier to move than cash.
MtGox was (and arguably still is) a major player in the BTC market, but after blunders like dwolla and the 2 week USD withdrawal hold, we reached a phenomenon where it was easier for panic sellers to get their money out via BTC first.  They literally have to buy it up, raising the MtGox price, before they can transfer the BTC and sell it somewhere else.  It's almost like a reverse crash.  Over time however, less USD is going into the exchange than before, so the price drops. 
Over the past few weeks you'll see MtGox is consistently higher priced than other exchanges.  If the arbitrage gap get's too large, people sell off and the cycle starts anew.  But MtGox's actual volume has been decreasing (while the other exchanges have seen growth) 
All at the same time, it's becoming really, really difficult to mine bitcoins (read: more cost effective to buy them) So I'm curious where the price will go.

The wall observer thread has been exploding with these kinds of conversations lately. I tried to get some snippets that summarize what's being claimed.  
The TL;DR is that apparently some big time sellers of Cascasius coins were contacted and asked about their business returning if Ebay changed their policies to be more accepting of bitcoin.
Granted, you have to take it all at face value.  This is all very interesting, but we probably shouldn't be too optimistic until there's some kind of official concrete announcement.

Mining isn't always a profitable venture.  Sometimes I see simply owning bitcoins as the easier, and more profitable avenue.  I just work, and dedicate a portion of my paycheck to buying more.  It's worked out splendidly. 
@_date: 2013-09-03 03:16:38
This doesn't make sense.  The big question I have is, were you using authy or google for your 2 factor?
I'm assuming you were at a level-2 account that allowed instant transfers.  But if we are to take this at face value then:
Someone accessed your coinbase account with your username and password, bypassed 2 factor to log in and then ordered the max bitcoin only to withdraw them to their external account immediately. 
But the thief really isn't stealing from you, they're stealing from coinbase. Bank charges are reversible, you can call your bank and basically contest the fact that Coinbase charged you.

A couple days ago I went to bitaddress.org and printed out a paper wallet for my friend (securely).
I transferred a sum of bitcoins to him that reflected an important date in his life.  For example 0.11052009
It wasn't terribly significant, but he thought it was an amazingly cool thing to own and had tons of questions about how it worked and how to securely save it.  Turned out to be a pretty fun gift!

As long as ASICs are around it will never be profitable for average joes to mine with GPU's again.  If the price crash happens miners may drop out, but it's unlikely that the difficulty will ever be as low as December 2012 again with this new tech on the scene.

If you have a US bank account, you can also buy through Coinbase.  Their rates are pretty fair and it's relatively easy to buy and sell BTC there.  (up to 50 per day)
The only downside is that before your account is fully verified, you'll need to wait about 4-6 days for a purchase to arrive, but if you have any issues just pop a message over to tech support and they'll get on it

Does it turn the subreddit into a much more organized news forum? Sure.  But it also alienates a huge number of people and there's a reason why it isn't as popular. 
There should be at least 1 bitcoin subreddit that isn't subjected to any kind of overbearing moderation.  Upvote and downvote arrows work for a reason.
