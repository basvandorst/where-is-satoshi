People shouldn't be using segwit right now until lightning is ready because if everyone uses it the effective blocksize will be 1.7MB which will grow the blockchain way too much for the average user without amazing internet to run a full-node. There's no reason to pressure businesses into adopting Segwit right now. Blocksize increases are unnecessary and harmful.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:22:33
Interesting. It's almost like relying on private companies for your scaling was a bad idea.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:37:33
I'm not happy about how big one company is in the Bitcoin mining world, but no matter how tiny the blocks are or how much you bully companies like Coinbase that asked for a blocksize increase to buy time for segwit, that's not going to help with the miner situation.
I use Coinbase to transfer Bitcoin all the time and pay no fees. I'm actually more concerned about the fees I pay to transfer Bitcoin when I can't rely on GDAX and have to instead use Segwit transactions since for segwit to make a significant difference everyone needs to be using it, but since it was a soft fork instead of a hard fork that is taking and will continue to take a long time.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:07:02
What you're saying is dangerous. If everyone uses segwit the blockchain will grow too quickly as each block will effectively be as large as 1.7MB, which will price a lot of people out of running full-nodes. Let's wait for lightning before we use Segwit. Paging can you get my back?

There's no threat of world-wide adoption of either BTC or BCH anytime soon, so this talk is silly.
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:28:08
Two reasons:
1. BTC has more hash power right now than it realistically needs
2. Dispersing hash power from China is good for decentralization. Having 70% of the hash power in China is somewhat alarming as it means the Chinese government could conceivably order the miners to attack Bitcoin.

Wrong. The size of the blockchain is getting to be too big just for people to download. Doesn't matter that you can disable uploading to other people. Again, see Luke-Jr's response. He's a Core Dev and knows more than you about this stuff.

I guess I don't really understand the significance of your distinction then. As far as I can tell these two markets are going to strongly influence one another. The existence of the futures market presents opportunities like this for traders: suppose Bitcoin is trading for $10000 and futures are trading for $20000. You can buy a Bitcoin for $10000 then sell a future contract for $20000. If Bitcoin is worth more than $20000 on your contract date than you still sold the underlying asset for significantly more than you bought it for, so you come out ahead, if Bitcoin goes down in value from $20000 than again you were still able to sell something you bought for $10000 for more than what you paid for it.

IOTA is a MySQL server. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:23:10
Arbitrage. When there's gaps in the difference between the futures price and the BTC price there are opportunities for traders to buy BTC and sell futures I.e.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:26:01
Even the lightning white paper calls for bigger blocks to get around exactly this problem! Why are we giving up BTC's market share to alts just so layer 1 stays shitty enough that layer 2 looks like shangrila?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:20
Agreed. Segwit2x having happened would have been one of the best things for Bitcoin right now. Fees would be nice and low. Mempool manageable.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:48:41
Not arguing there are not other potential issues with bigger blocks. Just pointing out the above poster made a bad argument against BCH. I think you and I are pretty much in agreement though.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:59:59
That will also get us what? 2x the transaction throughput? Do you think that alone will solve the problem of Bitcoin being slow and expensive to move?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:48:50
[The Lightning Whitepaper]( posits the need for 133 MB blocks if Bitcoin were to ever see mass adoption. Eventually we will need bigger blocks. Why leave them as they are when that causes Bitcoin to be useless for its originally intended purpose?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:48:53
Everyone needs to opt into segwit in order for the 1.7x block increase to take affect and clear the mempool.There's too much cognitive dissonance going around right now because the same people who rejected Segwit2x are now seeing why maybe in the near term a 2x block increase wasn't such a bad idea. Instead it's the companies' faults for not adopting Segwit fast enough. Is any other cryptocurrency as demanding of businesses for getting it's own codebase to work well?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:50:20
This is literally how a fork works in open-source software development. You "copy and paste" the code (clone the repo) then make the changes you want to make. Which in BCH's case was adding DAA, adjusting the blocksize, removing RBF, re-adding 0-conf, etc. It's inaccurate to pretend they have done nothing to add to the codebase based on their ideas about how Bitcoin should scale.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:39:43
I want BTC to be better too. Losing merchant adoption and having payment solutions seek other options should be a wake-up call to a community of devs that seems to have been paralyzed for the last three years from doing anything to improve BTC's throughput. Every altcoin subreddit talks about how shitty BTC is for payments, it's raison-d'etre. Rebranding it as "a store of value" is an after the fact rationalization that allows devs that seem cripplingly unable to deliver results to save face in light of what Bitcoin has become.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:28:49
With 8MB blocks Bcash has 8x the throughput that BTC has without segwit and a bit more than 4x the throughput of BTC with Segwit. There is no argument to be made that Bcash doesn't scale better than BTC right now.

Last I heard from Core LN was not coming out for at least 18 months. What do you think could happen in a fast moving space like this if for 18 months Bitcoin's only selling point is its market share while other coins with actual present day utility continue nipping at Bitcoin's heels? If we had a more functional coin right now we would have something more marketable to the general public. Bitcoin used to be fun. You could send it to your friends you could play games with it, you could mine it. Now you either just leave it on an exchange and try to trade with it or transfer it with your wallet and never think about it again except to wonder what the price is.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:55:12
So if Bitcoin is just a store of value then should we even support lightning? Why not keep it slow and expensive to move if that's a positive?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:02:23
Do the core devs have anyone working for them with a product vision? Like a product manager? I'm a software engineer by trade and I can tell you that without someone who can understand things from a customer perspective my colleagues could very easily get lost in the weeds, chasing perfect technical solutions while ignoring easy wins that make customers happy until the perfect solution can come out.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:47:00
They're supporting Bcash because Bitcoin costs $10 to transact with..
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:18:50
Untrue. Arbitrage forges a connection.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:44:54
A lot of the community can't really grasp the technical aspects of the scaling debate so things devolve into tribalism. I wholly agree with your sentiment though. It's a very off putting aspect of the cryptocurrency community at large.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:29:51
Nah they're pretty comparable look:  vs  Note as well that the Bitfinex futures (BT2) are trading for a shitty value compared to the HitBTC futures, probably for the reasons you described. I think the market on HitBTC is being made up by speculators like me who figured that even if Segwit2x is a shit coin that no one wants to touch like BTG $150 is too low for a coin that futures were valuing as high as $2000 considering the huge economic incentive futures bag holders and anyone else who got screwed now have to make sure that Segwit2x still happens.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:51:46
I'm dubious that BCH is going to make a run for dominance, because I feel like their time to do that was when BTC and BCH first forked, and the community already rejected that. But what I will say in BCH's favour is that their devs seem to care more about alleviating the transaction cost/time concerns that the community is complaining about. I find it actually kind of disturbing the amount of vitriol Segwit2x inspired from the community. It would alleviate the pain we're having right now with transaction times and costs without requiring that we wait at minimum 18 months for lightning to come out. Core can say they feel larger blocksizes aren't tested enough or whatever, but they've had almost 2 years to address and test solutions for a huge pain point to the community, and that every software upgrade proposed to deal with this has inspired so much divisiveness and vitriol from the largely non-technical community is surreal to me. 
Maybe I'm FUDing but it makes me feel like the community has put too much power in the hands of the Bitcoin devs who are presenting themselves as incompetent in my eyes. Compare the drama surrounding every single Bitcoin software improvement of late with the recent Ethereum hardfork. Those guys managed to hardfork their code recently with no issues and no drama, which is a huge contrast to the massive shitshow that is Bitcoin updates. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:38:47
I did. I already cashed out. I don't believe in Segwit2x or it's success, but for reasons similar to what you outlined I figured when it crashed to $150 it would pick up. I don't know that it will continue to grow much from this point. It's at around half what it was before it crashed because everyone thought they would be worth $0 on the fork date. I wouldn't recommend that people buy in at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:16:28
I think you're absolutely right. There's too much economic incentive for people to still conduct the fork, and it's also fairly easy to still go through with it regardless of what six guys who think they're important said on an email list. I reasoned this right away when people claimed the fork was cancelled and bought futures. The fork is still on in some manner. Too many wheels were in motion.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:11:54
That isn't the case on HitBTC where most of this is trading. I know this because I bought futures at the bottom and sold recently.

It was submitted by Craig's lawyers. From [the document](




@_date: 2019-04-13 04:27:18


The really damaging reputational hit is Craig's claim that Satoshi Nakamoto is Craig Wright. I can imagine few accusations more damaging to one's personal and professional relationships than that one.
@_date: 2019-04-14 01:39:45
Significantly, the actual wording of the legal notice makes it clear that he's being sued not for accusing Craig of commiting "criminal fraud," but rather, he is being sued for "falsely" suggesting Craig Wright is not Satoshi.

You vastly overestimate the standard of evidence required to defend against a defamation lawsuit. Roger doesn't need foolproof evidence, he just needs evidence that was credibly convincing **to him**. The thread Roger linked to is one of the most upvoted threads on r/btc ever. A lot of people believe the things that were said about Greg in it, and credibly Roger does too. Literally doesn't matter from here on out whether they are true or not. 
Defamation lawsuits are some of the hardest lawsuits to pursue. Few succeed. Disturbingly, what they have been used for somewhat successfully is in efforts to curb people's free speech. Defending against a frivolous lawsuit is not free, and in most states in the US you won't be compensated your legal fees simply because you won it and it was frivolous.
The threat of a frivolous lawsuit that would be thrown out before discovery can be enough to silence critics who do not want to endure the time sink, stress, and money sink that is defending a frivolous lawsuit.

Fees are down right now, yes. Your use-case is very different from Bitpay's though I'm guessing. The CEO of Bitpay [explains in this post]( how they arrived at their numbers. Note in particular that they design their tools so that payments will get added to the next block regardless of the congestion level. I imagine you personally can tolerate more delay before your transactions gets added to a block than they can with their business use-case.
Additionally, BTC has been designed around a congested blockchain to pay for security and incentivize layer-2 usage. So if fees spike to December-levels again you can expect the Core devs to do absolutely nothing about it. That alone means that pre-Lightning BTC is not particularly reliable for payments.
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:20:49
What on Earth are you talking about? The post you linked to in the mod logs was a satirical comment by Roger where he was ironically quoting Greg Maxwell. Many other people in the thread made jokes to this affect. You don't need to ask somebody for their legal information to sue them, you just sue them. Sending someone empty threats in email to silence their free speech is cowardly bad behaviour.
Also, the guy threatening to sue Roger is Greg Maxwell, former CTO of Blockstream and Bitcoin Core developer, not exactly some unknown ingenue. In the Bitcoin space he's a public figure.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:42:08
Why is that the logical thing? If your business is payment processing and not protocol development why would you do an about-face and start figuring out how to monetize protocol development, rather than switching to a more customer-friendly alternative currency and continuing business as usual.
Until LN is production-ready BTC cannot be depended on for making cheap reliable payments. It's for HODLing not transacting. Bitpay has been forced to consider alternative cryptocurrencies by decisions the BTC community has made. Cause and effect.
