So has anybody used it?

Alright thanks everybody, I'm going to PM all the initial respondents with a link to the Github source code. If this goes well, maybe we can make it more official charge a small fee in exchange for letting others join, similar to what was done with GunBot (

Python is just a programming language, you can find the docs here  You can find a Binance API written in python here

I recommend Python, as you don't have to worry about coding itself as much and focus on the task at hand (the syntax is super straight forward).
As for the bot, the logic is broken down into three parts, graphing, buying, and selling.
By graph I just mean requesting the price of whatever currency you're looking to by every let's say 0.33 seconds, and crunching that data so that you can use it for both buy and sell decisions. So for example this code should calculate the highest price recorded, lowest, average, etc.
For buying, you can just start by recording whatever price you initially come across and setting both a minimum price decrease percentage and increase percentage. The decrease is used to gauge when to buy, however, if you don't wait for the price to increase/rebound after the decrease, there's no way to tell if the price is still on its way down. For example you could set the minimum decrease ti 10% and the follow up increase to 0.05% just a safety measure.
For selling you do the same thing, just the opposite. Wait for the price to increase a set amount, and then wait for a decrease to be sure the train isn't still going up.
The most difficult thing is figuring out when to buy, if you could algorithmically figure out the minimum decrease percentage for buy this would be easy money. Unfortunately without that solved, I'd recommend staying away from Bitcoin day trading given the current market.
