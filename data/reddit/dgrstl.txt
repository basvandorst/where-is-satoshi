Sure they are!

How can we start using Lighting Network once it has that much nodes running in the mainnet
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:17:13
If those big card provider fell down, why do you expect smaller ones to succeed when it totally depends on Visa?
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:24:32
They can't just ban something is everywhere and spreading real fast.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:54:06
Interesting though but anyways chances aren't by just the number or PC's mining but also the hashrate the machine takes, really difficult to win that lotery with a raspberry pi but it's legit.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:52:00
Have seen people waiting weeks here buddy, just wait.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:50:16
You should e-mail them.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:28:36
Yeah, KFC accepted bitcoin for that bucket.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:51:31
People have to read everything really carefully everywhere smh.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:02:34
true though.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:02:44
Wouldn't really do that, just pay your fees smh.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:58:47
Sure, this is way better.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:11:46
The number of the transaction, check Coinbase it must have one, then you can go to  and paste it in the search bar and will show up the info and progress of that transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:57:39
Cool concept imo.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:47:10
No EOS there dude?
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:16:54
You expected some chicken with Ƀ shape?
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:08:04
Probably eBay accepts cryptos before OpenBazaar goes main.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:56:57
Not fake lol check their twitter though.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:47:25
uhh :( 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:50:30
Don't you have the Tx number?
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:04:02
Scams are used to be really correct when written but due to comprehension, we should be able to detect when the context itself has something weird on it. Not meant just read, I mean everything that comes with it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:13:43
True indeed, Venezuela is even launching its own crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:18:55
Probably just as safe as the web, you can use the web from the phone also.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:07:11
Neat stickerrrrrr probably buying one!
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:14:03
Just verify your account, if not,get in contact with them.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:27:15
Incredible, that's a solid argument, you are right my friend, Bitcoin, at least now, ins't allowed to be a real currency, just a reference.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:11:17
Here you have a smart answer.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:33:31
It hurts just to read I believe how he has to be now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:49:44
And he could have what he bought + 8999.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:24:18
You better go to the ShapeShift's subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:13:58
I doubt but it could.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:51:21
There's a subredit here cash4cash, I think there you might do it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:02:54
Ripple is going nutssss!
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:21:02
I wouldn't recommend you using BTC at all for small transactions. Average fees are crazy af
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:15:57
^ this.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:51:48
I'm with you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:23:23
Luckly adblockers are currently blocking them.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:19:28
Somehow they will do something to controll it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:31:29
Well, it's actually posible to replace USD, not now but in a couple of years I'm sure one of these cryptos will replace it.
What I meant with BTC being *over-bubbled* is that just check its price, do you really believe a coin who has made people rich off just $1 like who could really handle all that bubble money? And what about those high fees and the recently saturation on the blockchain?
Bitcoin is only standing up because it's something near famous but it isn't the best for being the world's go-to currency. It is even about to fall down and kill all those BTC-richs.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:25:14
For iOS I use Jaxx. I wouldn't use Coinbase as a wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:05:50
I'm really out of BTC as its price will give a huge drop anytime soon, I prefer not to take that risk at those 19K dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:11:18
Never too late for some other coins.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:57:15
EOS has no transaction fees and they have parallel processing so data will go way more faster.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:52:47
yeahhhh give their white paper a readd ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:04:45
BTC is too *over-bubbled* to replace USD.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:15:32
^not a tax pro like he said but that's a reasonable answer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:58:57
this is my go-to.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:01:54
Interests and market movements made it go high, then as price was way too high it had a correction and now is trying to be stable, giving the price of 14-16k.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:30:54
haha, probably
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:17:54
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:42:32
Extremely correct.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:00:59
What I usually do is check lots of subs, most of them are like this so I'm feeding myself with a bit of everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:40:43
I second this. Binance is the best exchange out there!
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:50:52
Yeah haha way better than that.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:10:51
ripple had a real boost damn it
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:11:27
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:55:39
Really good read thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:05:38
Interesting concept, anyways exchanges doesn't really care a lot about that haha but sure, would love to see that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:50:47
Try! Nobody knows, idk find the post where you received the tip and start looking up. Someone has to know what happened with ChangeTip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:02:30
Yesssssss, really happy today I decided to sleep later.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:28:42
XRP and the actual Ripple product aren't the same thing so I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:57:28
This would be really convinient, a more comfortable way to talk in this crypto world.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:53:29
Really cool :) your daughters are lucky they are already into this.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:33:11
How someone refuses to at least try to find $6,415,965? Must be a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:02:52
They are doing this just with BCH, nothing to do with other coins.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:14:08
This is the time to invest in any coin, almost every crypto is down.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:50:03
Congrats! Awesome to know she's already in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:00:08
Grateful for this Chrismas present. Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:59:16
Link to the website?
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:44:59
No family out of Alaska?
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:32:04
Would be like with alts, the price would be really btc-dependent and as we all know it means pump and dump almost everyday.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:51:07
The solution is not using BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:21:08
I wouldn't touch ripple at it's current price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:11:09
It's a system correction but anyways it's the start of the end of this bubble. That's what I meant.
Anyways good luck for those who are still investing in BTC, I hope you have great profits, I'm just outta there.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:39:58
When $5k to 3k happened transaction fees were not $20/tx
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:21:20
It'll get lower.
Really excited about how this bubble is starting to popp
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:47:23
 here you can check the average fee, I think $1.50 isn't really possible by now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:16:29
Done, comment here the results when done please.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:48:26
Look up the bot page, there should be instructions for that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:19:47
Haha, happy for you dude!
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:14:06
You clearly haven't used BTC for a transaction. Average fee right now is $50, how is that a bright future?
Unless they implement lightning network, BTC is garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:16:09
You can get started in bitcoin and then get risky with some alts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:03:03
hahahaha really accurate video!
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:24:01
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:46:31
It's safe in terms of price cause it doesn't go below $1 usually.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:25
Looks great mate!
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:54:17
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:47:29
These days you shouldn't expect a fast response from them...
Didn't you kept the code/QR? Use Authy instead of Google Auth next time, it does a back up of all your accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:23:08
BTC is overvalued. Rusty and old technology, there are better ones out there. Look at Dash and you will get my point.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:59:42
Kind of right here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:56:06
He doesn't deserve it IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:07:05
That's possible but anyone knows. Future will tell us.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:11:06
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:48:29
It's really useful ;)
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:12:52
 might be realy useful for you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:52:54
He's right, crypto is the new money. BUT it doesn't mean BTC has to be that worldwide exchange coin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:45:07
Not really sure about it tbh with you but it has worked for me.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:23:41
Lightning network can solve this, I hope it gets implemented soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:02:42
uh thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:35:18
Here things are different haha.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:11:22
Do some research on what cryptos to get, definitely people should invest in more than 1 crypto, having always a *safe* one like ETH or BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:38:36
If someone here gives you the correct answer and you find $6,415,965 you should tip the one who helped haha
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:55:27
Haha good move there!
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:56:19
I moved all my BTC recently, it going higher and I'm probably not having those profits but that's a risk I have to take, that bubble will pop anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:09:23
Whoa, interesting, I'm searching for more of this in the web.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:44:25
Uh, I don't know how to help you if it's gone :/
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:14:06
Try to exchange with someone you already know, or idk any familiar could do that for you, you send the money and they send you back your btc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:57:55
Bubble about to pop...
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:39:48
True :( hopefully EOS will get over it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:51:32
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:58:06
Who knows, if you are going to buy buy now that you can haha, don't think that much in a future that nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:54:24
I'd like to know too!
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:59:20
Already Christmas on Crypto!
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:28:49
I think the title is misleading. Blockchain is not getting phished, people that get into that fake like are getting phished.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:47:55
Hopefully, it will be faster than Yahoo itself LOL.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:34:28
I used to listen about Bitcoin on some forums I used to hang around. Never took the initative to learn more about it, even though people were selling it 1-1 with USD and used it because it was anonymous and couldn't be charged back, not like PayPal those days where you could open a chargeback on literally everything.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:51:02
Malta is a small country, but they do know how to get that $$$.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:29:01
I always had my doubts about LN but im starting to get more and more excited for it.
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:57:38
Of course that with big investments you take great returns.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:42:02
That's why we need crypto, not just Bitcoin, but CRYPTOCURRENCIES.
