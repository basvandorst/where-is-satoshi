This may help

"Get started now" might be a good idea for TESTNET only. A notice saying you are skipping nessisary steps to stay secure would be helpful.
Trezor capable with the word backup.
Hardware integration for at least some accounts would be useful.

Unplug the device?

This feature has been available for credit cards for a long time
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:23:01

@_date: 2014-09-22 05:13:20
Target audience is very different

Just installed. 
Love the comprehensive setup!
It was difficult to understand I had to confirm the word backup before I could view real Bitcoin account.
Is the wallet trezor compatible?
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:55:29
Thanks for clearing that up

Can a HD wallet branch be used to track a reoccurring subscription?
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:03:15


Maybe keep the "accounts" icon available and add an alert to say you have to confirm your word list.

Yes please help me understand how address reuse is related to payment interception?
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:48:34
Classy graphic

Centralized systems will always be faster.
They require third party trust, but this can be okay for normal spending.
Bitcoin does not have consumer protection it is in the hands of the user.  Multisig does allow for protection with a second or third signer for each transaction.
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:49:44
But does the explanation make any sense?
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:18:15
Drm = Digital rights management.   Does not mean you have to encrypt file.
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:41:00
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:46:12
Then they implemented noncustodial multi sig

Now to 1 bit to dollar parity!

Lightning is bitcoin. Bitcoin is not reversible

Yes thank you,
I was thinking the client has to make a route to pay the invoice, so it has to "know" the network
@_date: 2017-01-15 14:26:42
its the peso. but the Philippine one.
And operating in the US
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:56:57
The nodes are known, so there will be a graph showing those and even the open channels.
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:48:41
Needs to be cheap,  and you need to plug in while unbroken to verify contents.
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:15:40
Look!, no need to remove the plastic! :)

People who like the easy payment transfer

You can choose which server you give your wallet info to.

That's is what nitrated does. Reputation....

Will you eventually be able to confirm the actual asset moving?
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:03:22
How are the other address' generated? 
I got 2 from compressed and uncompressed private key.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:03:50
Does this support passphrase?
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:23:00
Verify with the trezor screen
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:47:08
Validated to the point of survivability.  Network effects are strong.
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:13:58
The other proved inputs.
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:27:21
I have multiple people where using a mobile device is much more friendly. If with tor you could use trezor from setup to daily use, it would remove many barriers. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:31:47
It does look great.  Is it open source?
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:18:57
This is the state of my account. Fully verified, can't buy. Emails to support come back with supervisor saying they can do nothing.
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:14:16
Is actually kind of nice way to get information, when responded to nicely
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:00:53
Is there a link?

Do you have to wait until the deposit clears to move the funds to Gdax?
Gemini is similar to Coinbase in that you can instantly lock in the BTC price while waiting for the deposit
