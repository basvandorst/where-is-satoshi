I would like to see the DMV replaced with a blockchain and some online tools.  The DMV is a pain to deal with and most of it could be automated.  One of the big hurdles to automating something like the DMV is validation that is currently done by humans.  This could be done on the blockchain in an automated fashion.  Transferring ownership of a car could be as easy as a TX.  The DMV already issues identification, so they could issue identification that also links to a hash on their blockhain.

I saw similar wording in the new bitlicense from NY.  I wonder how it will be interpreted and if coinbase will shut down there too.

 this is a good timeline of events.  Not all the transcripts are available here, I read them as they were made available during the trial so you'll have to seek them out on your own.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:53:44


  
This is an assumption on your part and does not makes sense given that adding the murder-for-hire to the case would have complicated the prosecution of the case since they would have had to not only prove Ulbricht was DPR but also prove the murder for hire.  Instead they dropped that charge for this trial but still presented some of the evidence.


  
It's not slander when there is evidence that he tried to kill people.  I am free to form my own opinion using the facts or I can be free like the majority in this thread and just believe what is popular without looking at the facts.  I prefer to not be a sheep.

A couple of points:
  
- They aren't rich now.  
- Since they aren't rich and they are "giving away my hours and energy to someone else", then they are working for a living.  
- Since they aren't rich and they are working for a living, then they are putting their hard earned money into bitcoin in hopes that it will go up in value while assuming a bunch of risk.
- Since they aren't rich and they are working for a living while spending that hard earned money on bitcoin, then if bitcoin goes to the moon, then they worked for it.
  
This person is putting their hard earned money into an asset that has huge upside potential and if it realizes that upside, they worked hard for the reward and they took a lot of risk to get there.

You really should review the evidence.  Ross Ulbricht tried to kill people and there is plenty of evidence to back that up.  You can question it all you want and refuse to decide for yourself, but that doesn't make me wrong for coming to this conclusion after reviewing what is available.  I don't refuse to believe Al Capone was a murderer because he wasn't charged with murder.

I don't know about *inspiring* but they could issue their own crypto and completely control money for the life of the money.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:39:06


  
Credit cards still *just work* and bitcoin offers nothing over them right now except some speculative long-term potential and perceptions of *freedom*.  You are using bitcoin right now if you believe it is the future or you just want to see what it is all about and higher fees and full blocks are not going to change those people.
  
You can speculate and have fear and doubt all you want, but some of us have been doing that for years and know better.  These block size arguments and the soon to arrive reward halving arguments are well worn.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:18:03
You're acting like an idiot.  The corrupt federal agents were in a different office and none of their work was used to convict Ulbricht.  Maybe you're trying to say all federal agents are corrupt in which case I double-down and retract "acting" from my first sentence.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:29:55
I know they state "Coinbase does not have access to any bitcoin stored in the multisig vault."  But their info-graphic implies they have access to funds using the Coinbase Key and Shared Key.

Coinbase has been very reliable and secure for me.  Don't use them if you want to use your bitcoin for gambling or buying drugs on the dark market or you will get your account closed.

If they are a signatory on a multisig address then they are in control since those funds cant move without action on their part and those funds are lost if they lose the ability to sign.

1k is around the last peak.  I want to stop putting money into this when it starts to cross the last peak bubble price.  I did this last time when it hit 250 in 2013, I stopped until it dropped again.
  
I might stop buying sooner since I do have a target amount I'm looking for.  If I get to X bitcoin before the price gets to 1k per coin I will also stop buying.

@_date: 2015-06-03 16:36:45
It does appear to be open to interpretation.  By your interpretation, companies that don't deal with fiat would be forced to hold an amount of fiat determined by the NYDFS.  I wonder if they could say that a company needs to hold a dollar amount equal to the exchange value of the digital currency they hold on behalf of customers.  That would be very prohibitive and could be selectively enforced by the NYDFS.

All of the evidence we have seen points to Ross Ulbricht requesting the hits, not VJ.
  


  
None of the evidence from their investigation was used to convict Ulbricht and their arrest and evidence from their activities, specifically Force further corroborates that Ulbricht tried to kill people.
  


  
They didn't need to charge him and it would have only made the case more complicated to prosecute.  And as you can see, they already had enough to put him away for life.
  


  
You mean he single-handedly convinced millions of people to not touch bitcoin because it was associated with crime.
  
You seem incredibly delusional.

Keep in mind that application fee is only for a license to operate in NY.  If every State copies them then it will be $250,000 for US coverage and that is not counting existing licenses and fees.

I did read it.  I'm pointing out that the text of the law is all that matters.  None of his hot air makes a difference.  And I personally disagree that it is impossible to ban bitcoin or that they cant regulate our wallets when our wallets are just information and they require the use of the internet to work.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:23:24
That's how it looks to me too.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:25:25
Most people are using apps or online wallets that set the fee for them or pay it outright, so it's really not that big of a deal since most people don't think about the fee anyway.  The service will pay a higher fee or the wallet will be updated with a new higher minimum fee if it were to be a problem.  It isn't a problem.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:46:55
I hope it never stabilizes.
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:52:28
If Coinbase is one of the signatories, then they are still in control of users bitcoin.

Transactions failing to confirm does not affect exchanges since exchanges operate off-chain.  Your ability to get bitcoin on\off the exchange is affected and that is something you would plan and put thought into anyhow.

According to this text:


  
The NYDFS just needs to state that you need a bond or trust account equivalent to x percentage of bitcoin you hold on behalf of customers and it's the same thing.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:40:17


Then you sent it to an address that isn't associated with your account and Coinbase likely does not have the private keys for.  I'm guessing you grabbed an address from your transactions screen(the one your screenshot shows).  You basically gave away 10 BTC.  I would look through your transactions and figure out who that transaction was and that should tell you who owns that key and who you need to contact.  I bet Coinbase has already indicated as much but you have discovered you have no way to contact them and you're trying to put the blame on Coinbase.
