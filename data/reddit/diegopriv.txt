@_date: 2017-12-13 06:37:47
Sorry man��for all the confusion! I'm 15 and i have a bit of bitcoin and a lot of ltc��all I do is hold and i never ever sell
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:48:52
Today's high is tomorrow's dip
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:26:00
Alright man, well I just wanted to help the man��but a simple way is coinbase then link bank account or debit card and then just buy btc at a drop of 10%
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:08:01
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:43:20
Shiet��I wish i could manipulate it that much��but to whoever reads Reddit knows to hold on and that's its just a quick fix, and you'll profit from the weaklings that sold
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:35:15
Thanks I understand now��Reddit is da bae
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:32:40
I'm 15 and I've bought like 160 worth of ltc and btc,  just use parents stuff,  my profit so far has been 294%
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:20:39
U got Snapchat I can teach u lol? I helped a guy on Reddit earlier
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:37:13
����dude your the man! So basically he is basically pumping the market? So when it hits an all time high people will sell and then he will buy at lower?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:51:38
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:12:00
Thank you for the information? So just keep a similar  range of percentages
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:17:32
What's that?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:37:17
That's what i did secretly and bought like 160+ worth of life coin at around 80 bucks and then I told my mom that i would have a suprise in her account, and she's like did u buy something��I was like yeah, she's like it better not be that coin crap, because I've been telling her since btc was at 3,000 and since ltc was at like 56$, so I bought it without consent and now she makes fun of me for not going all in with her card��
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:57:10
Im still a bit confused, will futures affect ltc in any way? Maybe people will leave btc and switch to ltc?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:06:24
Do u have Snapchat Lol? I'll guide u through it
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:43:04
Invest as much as your willing to loose! If you had a bill in your pocket, how much would it have to take for you to go back and look for it on the ground if u dropped it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:39:01
Thanks man, another quick thing? I diversified my portfolio at 13% bitcoin and the 87% of it on ltc? Idk if I should make my portfolio 50 50? I think ltc has a good potential as well. Thanks
Any feed back is appreciated
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:26:38
Can you explain a sell wall?
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:52:55
Invest into xrp,ada,xlm,and ltc
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:23:48
Where :o
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:24:15
DO NOT USE IT
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:45:36
Thanks for the useful advice��
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:24:37
Thank you! I'm still a bit confused? Does that mean price will increase or decrease, what's your prediction?
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:26:38
I think Decemener 18 4pm London time
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:56:06
How much has it increased in percentage since u bought, use block folio
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:39:59
Also how do I setup a bitcoin or ltc miner? Im interested idk where to get one or what to do? Since im 15 I don't have any expenses. So that's a plus for me
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:17:41
Thank you so much
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:01:42

Add me on snapchat diegopriv.com
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:32:29
Thank you so much, I'm still learning as I'm 15
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:29:17
Yes if u bought through coinbase, prices are locked in at what u bought em,  so let's say uh bought 1 bitcoin for 100 dollars and when they arrive they are priced at 500$ you still own that portion of btc from your initial contribution.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:31:57
Oh so basically some Asian guy is manipulating the system?
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:06:34
4pm London time i believe
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:04:10
I say by the 20th
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:12:40
Is that an L���� I invested in ltc actually not BTC LOL������
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:04:58
50$ man��good start I'm 15 and i secretly bought like 140 worth with my moms cc  I pray that it rises exponentially before the funds are withdrawn in 7 days from bank account, anyways man there is a remove card button or bank button on the card section on the left tab or right 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:01:27
Why are you saying 3 weeks? Not accurate
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:50:03
Yeah lol, she got upset at first when i told her I did it but she makes fun of me now
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:26:55
It goes by percentages, if you started off with 100$ and it went up 32% your initial balance of 100$ is now 132
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:06:52
Futures and gut feeling, also reading Reddit gives me hope lmao��I bought litecoin from the ranges if 141-168 and now I'm profiting, i see a rise a substantial ruse in btc in the next few days, I'm 15 btw��
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:56:23
Or use crypto-value.info
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:38:56
There is a taxi service that accepts GCN coin as a payment :) it is based in Dublin
