I feel sorry for the internet the day Bitcoin passes $9000.

Big blockers who aren't very smart about security.

With that much already being shorted, the present price must already be reflecting the bearishness. 
That's a super bullish sign. 
On the other hand, many exchanges worldwide (especially asia) won't be operational for the 1st and in some cases up until the 7th. That'll cause a lack of liquidity. 
On the third hand, anyone moving their coins during the fork and soon afterwards are taking a risk of it going missing. I think we'll see a lot more hodling than usual.
So, lower liquidity, fewer exchanges open, more hodling, and a general bullish sentiment underlying it all. 
Sounds like moon to me, but it's really anyone's guess.

Actually this news was announced today.

We'll see. Bitcoin started out at a quarter of a penny each. 
We've had quite a few jumps that size already, and no real reason for it to stop before it takes the  currency spot.

Dude, check the papers, banks thieving jewelry and gold out of safe deposit boxes is not a super rare occurrence. Courts don't even seem to care that they do it sometimes. 
Try a fireproof safe at home. Disguise it to look like an endtable or something. Shouldn't be rocket science.

I remember people saying that about Bitcoin reaching $10. (Of course it was ScarJo at the time.)

Even if they only have  0.0001 btc, they could be one day!

The Bank safety deposit box is LITERALLY the last place you want to keep a bitcoin seed!
Think about it, banks get busted for pilfering through those things all the damn time. - And they only get busted when things go missing.
With a seed, it doesn't even have to go missing! They can read your seed, put it back exactly where they found it, and your funds could go missing in a way that they would completely and totally deny... Which you'd have no legal recourse against!
I could even see banks making this an unofficial policy to do one day when the fight against bitcoin gets serious enough.
GET ALL SEEDS THE HELL OUT OF BANKS!

I use a Trezor and simply told my wife how to use it and where the seed is kept if anything goes wrong with it. 
I can't see how that could go wrong if something goes wrong with my pulse.

It was never possible before bitcoin... Now we CAN take it with us!

Some of us still don't believe that females ever started using the internet.

Wow, that's how Time's readers are learning about Bitcoin, eh? 
Does this crapcoin even trade on an exchange at all?

Welcome to last year, Futurism.

What a great analogy! I've been waiting for that explanation for over a year.
I bet Satoshi doesn't understand bitcoin as well as Andreas.

So glad no whiny fiat-lovers are in here claiming you aren't rich until you've realized the gains by cashing out... Refreshing how times have changed.

No one suggested that if all devs poll for it, then the code would be replaced. Devs are only part of the community.
However, they're the experts on what the code does and what it's limitations are. If they all say "X will hurt bitcoin," then only an uninformed or suicidal public will want to continue doing X. 
We have both uninformed and suicidal people around here begging to hard fork bitcoin. It's up to the informed and healthy people to change their ignorant minds.
