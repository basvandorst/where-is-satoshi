The end game.
Realisation that the whole financial system is based on trust and that the way the system is currently set up means that some of that trust is misplaced.
There will be defaults or high inflation, one way of another, in multiple countries with high debt to GDP ratios (Japan anyone?).
Bitcoin and gold will be the beneficiaries in that scenario, when trust in others is running thin.

It's not the same argument though.  Gold is not money in the modern world.
It's obvious that you are far down the rabbit hole and probably heavily invested in Bitcoins.
I don't disagree with everything you say but you seem to be convinced regardless of evidence that the modern financial system is "teetering on global collapse" and that Bitcoin will 100% succeed as fiat's replacement.
I wonder how many people like you are invested in Bitcoins currently and how low the price will go before you will sell out?  Makes me question whether I should invest in Bitcoins at this current price (I'm pro Bitcoins by the way).

Bitcoin curious here.  What's the need for covering up the QR code?  I thought that was just the public key?  Is it just as precautionary measure?
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:40:10
You are completely right.  The global financial system is base on financial assets and liabilities, the ultra riches' wealth is just the other side of the coin of high government, corporate and household debt.
When most of the participants in the economy (i.e. Not the 1%ers) have little wealth or earning power, where is the demand going to come from?
Rich people can only eat so much caviar and drink so much Dom Perigon.
A big deleveraging is still due to come somewhere down the line.  Bitcoin has the potential to be a wonderful hedge in this scenario.

Holy crap.  Thanks for the great explanation.
Makes huge amounts of sense.  Lots and lots of unused spare computing capacity going to waste.  The internet is enabling the world to use this spare capacity.  The big deal right now is the 'sharing economy'.  Companies like Uber, AirBnB, who has very little working capital tied up (no taxis or hotels) but have a huge valuation/usefulness to the world.
21 Inc is the computing power equivalent of Uber or AirBnB.
This makes SO MUCH sense.  I was already a believer of Bitcoins value before this post (lack of counterparty risk, ease of transferring value - it is digital gold).
However, you've just added another major case to investing in Bitcoin (would love to invest in 21 Inc but can't get access!).  I'm ever more convinced that this will turn out to be the greatest decision of my life in 10 years time.

I agree.  In my opinion breaking this current downtrend is going to take a shifting of perceptions of Bitcoin.
There is currently no real new demand as to why someone should hold Bitcoin at this moment.  All the tech savvy investors are already in this.  Until we see people seeing Bitcoin as a viable asset class there will not be a crazy multiple price rise.

What happens if, say, 50% of the miners go out of business?  Does the difficulty of mining BTC just come down proportionally and the existing miners would share the remaining mining rewards?  Or does it threaten the integrity of the BTC network?

I echo these comments.
It's practical issues which day to day users come across which needs to be fixed for mass adoption to have a chance of happening.
I'm still not convinced some of the problems in Bitcoin can be resolved, but will be watching with much interest on the sideline for now.

Personally I'd wait a month or two to see if things stabilises a bit.
It's just broken $300 support and action (&gt;14% down in one day) like this is highly bearish.  My bet is that in 2 weeks time the price will be lower than it is now.

You are a moron but I'll entertain your post with an intelligent response.


I like Tesla as a company but I'm not buying at $200+.  I'd like to invest my money in assets at a good price for the amount of risk I'm taking.  I'm here to INVEST not fight an IDEOLOGICAL FIGHT.


A lot of what you said in this paragraph isn't true.  Price isn't necessarily a reflection of "both utility or adoption".  When the price 10x to &gt;$1,000 last year, did BTC sudden become 10x more useful or have 10x as many users?


Back to the Tesla argument - I believe in Tesla, but price doesn't matter?


It is winter in Britain.  The sky looks like it is going to rain.  I can't predict the future but probably safe to bring an umbrella just in case.
My guess is someone with your mentality will lose a lot of money in the markets someday, whether it is BTC, tulips or anything else.

Confidence is belief in oneself, which is a result of experience (historical data) which suggests their own ability usually brings about the desired result.
Arrogance is misplaced confidence, having the behaviours of confidence whilst not having the ability to back it up.
Unfortunately most people can't distinguish between the two because they are not good judges on whether people have the 'ability to back up their confidence/arrogance', because they lack expertise in the area they are judging on.
I guess that's why fake it till you make it works so often in most cases.

I think that would really destroy the Bitcoin economy.  It's great hearing Trezor is getting these excellent reviews - I will be purchasing one in the near future.
However, if it ends up that it becomes popular and then Trezor users getting fucked over, I can't imagine I'd ever invest in Bitcoin again.
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:18:56
The guy is absolutely spot on that mainstream media/politicians has the focus on money and wealth completely backwards.
Politicians bang on about spending and budgets but COMPLETELY misses the point of what they are spending the money on and whether it is being spent effectively.  Focusing on GDP growth alone is moronic.
I'd actually argue however that the modern monetary system does most things very well - it is the best system we have had up until now.  Compare real wealth of the average person vs someone 100 years ago - the modern person would be like a king in comparison.  This is also the reason why most people do not understand money - they don't need to.  It just works.
Whether Bitcoin/digital currencies are a superior form of money is a separate debate.  There are some very promising signs as well as some very worrying signs.  If there is one thing for certain, it looks like there will be a lot of disruptive innovations in the financial sector in the next couple of decades...  Let's all hope we all get rich as a result of being early adopters of tech.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:41:32
This is on point.  I'm a big believer in BTC but I'm holding off in investing as I just can't see anything pushing up the price in the short/medium term.
Will think about putting some serious money in maybe once it hits $100 (if it does).
I've been investing/trading for too long and the current action just looks like it has further to drop.  Don;t get me wrong, if we're right the price anyone posting here getting into BTC will be irrelevant 10-20 years in the future but I'd rather get in at a better price if I think I can.
Can't predict the future though but just doesn't seem like there's much reason for newcomers to hold BTC until the next serious financial/banking crisis and counterparty risk becomes a thing again.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:51:13
For example?
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:12:14
It's scary how little traditional finance the Bitcoin community knows.  
Bitcoin is a fantastic technology, but until it solves the problems which the current fiat/banking system solves PLUS does other things better, it's value will not be fully realised.
And for people who comment about how the current fiat system is a rubbish system etc - you probably don't realise how easy it is for you to carry out your day to day life - how often do you think about how money works?  You don't - because you don't need to most of the time.
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:44:35
Yes and no.
Yes in the sense that some growth has been financed by borrowing which needs to be repaid in the future.
No because remember the argument of money/debt does not equal wealth?  Debts can (and should) be written off for unenterprising ventures, which leaves society with the created wealth but not the saddled debts.
Some of the problems with the current situation is partially due to political cronyism (IMO) in that insolvent institutions haven't been 'allowed' to default and punish risk being taken in the wrong places.  Sometimes it's not solely a problem with the system, but partly to do with the players in the system as well.  Though you can argue that the fact the system allows the players to abuse it is an inherent weakness of the system.
I believe we have a fundamental disagreement on some facts on the modern financial system (we've commented posts before), but have friended you for your input on Bitcoin and related topics.
FYI I work in finance. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 00:13:59
That's the point most people misunderstand.  Gold or Bitcoin isn't just a protection against inflation, it is ultimately a hedge against counterparty risk.
As I've already pointed out, the majority of wealth in the modern world is in financial assets, which on the other side of the coin are financial liabilities which are likely never to be repaid.  The whole world is in denial.
Once the ultra rich catches on that:
1) Leaving money in the bank isn't safe as banks themselves hold a ton of financial assets and the risk is systemic, so if the system breaks, they all their money (aside from government guaranteed amounts) anyway.
2) Government bonds are not really 'risk free'.  Yes there is no default risk but once political pressure gets too much, governments will either tax a significant chunk of it or it will be inflated away by (QE or deficit spending without price stability in mind).  Either way they won't get their money back.  Bonds are already expensive anyway.
3) Equities will be a big no no in that environment.
4) Gold will be ultra bid.  But the risk of confiscation from governments is still there.  plus it's less transportable than cash or Bitcoins.
Think about it, if you had a good few hundred millions in the above environment, were would you park your money?
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:42:43
It's pretty stupid, especially after the run that it's had in 2016.
Personally I wouldn't put anything more than 10% of my portfolio into bitcoin at this time (currently ~0%).
Though I can understand it that this is money you can afford to lose and you are hoping for a "home run", in my opinion these things generally don't work out that way.  If I were you I would take some profit and wait it out - no asset even goes up in a straight line; IMO there will be opportunities to get back in at a better price.
@_date: 2019-03-18 13:19:11
The concept of money and stores of value, it's role in the economy and how the modern banking system works is not an easy topic for most people to understand.

If the value has already dropped in the market then you've already lost value.  Whether you decide to convert it into cash makes no difference.
It's only true if it goes back up within a reasonable time frame.

This is going to end in tears for a lot of people.  Am happy for those who made their profits in bitcoins, but I wound definitely advise cashing out a portion of the wealth and diversifying if I was in that position.

Not sure why you got downvoted.  Backed by government is the reason why fiat is not worthless paper.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:19:04
1) This is incorrect.  What you state is only correct within countries with a well developed banking system.  International transfers can be difficult even for multinational corporates.
2)True - but the other side of that coin is that you have to trust your bank.  Counterparty risk isn't an issue until it is.  Most of the time it is fine but when there is a systemic crisis people DON'T trust banks.
3) True.  Not sure what the solution to this is for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-03 22:21:19
I guess it's probably wishful/ideological thinking.
These people think that if fiat = worthless then Bitcoin = Moon.
It's a classic blind optimism shown by naive investors.  Just because Bitcoin may have a potentially a big future doesn't mean fiat is the most successful money system we have had in the history of mankind (we are wealthier per capita than at any other time in our history).

Also, instead of counterparty risk Bitcoins just swaps it for price risk.
For monetary items you can never really get away with there being a risk that the market won't pay the full value you paid for it.
Call it credit risk or price risk or whatever you want, it's the risk of the public losing faith in it as a medium of exchange or store of value.
Bitcoins rally has basically been the opposite of that - the acceptance by more people that it is a legitimate store of value.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:41:30
I'll add some solid financial assets to this list as well (these won't be popular on this sub but they are the high quality assets non the less):
Government Bonds of developed nations (US, UK, Germany, Swiss, Canada, Australia etc).  There is ZERO chance of default.  You might lose some money in inflation but that's the same as cash, except there's less counterparty risk in the bank holding your cash going bankrupt (or thieves stilling your cash hoards at home).
There's a reason why people are willing to hold high quality assets for zero or even negative yields.

Take this as a lesson.  You didn't have the mentality of earning and retaining wealth.  The fact is that gambling is mostly a surefire way of quickly losing wealth.
The investing part was good, but the gambling part was a mistake.  Learning this is an important life lesson that will help you retain the wealth you may create in the future.
