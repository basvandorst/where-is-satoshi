So your argument against me pointing out you are clearly biased against bitcoin, is to make some more arguments against it. Good work
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:34:23


If you say so sweetheart
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:29:12
Better to just talk about bitcoin 24/7? More productive?
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:22:25
I have bitcoin for a number of reasons, including as an investment, but I don't mind the volatility. You get used to the booms and crashes and just get the popcorn.
@_date: 2014-12-10 09:53:07
Its worth is proportional to how much bitcoin you need to secure

How did you make 6 figs?
@_date: 2014-12-10 05:24:08
my first tip, thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:52:37
Its for the best. You can go and do a bit more research on what money is for and why the reason for acceptance is immaterial to the validity of the trade.

Then why make this thread 8 months after selling?

The third biggest company on earth just started accepting it. Maybe they know something that you are missing?

Paid in BTC =/= fixed amount of BTC obviously. If someone is getting wages in BTC they are getting $xxxx worth of BTC a week/month. If the price tanks they lose some of their purchasing power up until payday. Unless they live paycheck to paycheck, they are not going to be screwed, regardless of what the price does.

Because their isn't enough money in those 3 alts combined to make it a worthwhile undertaking. As soon as there is people will do it.
@_date: 2014-10-07 02:19:29
Just time. People need some time to come to terms with the idea of purely digital assets.
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:29:04
If you think this is a valid argument against bitcoin you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the function of money is.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:24:09
Can you stop making terrible threads, thanks.

Its just data and the rules that govern the data. It could be workable on any internet upgrade.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:25:05
Or because you don't even have the IQ to lie on the internet convincingly.
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:27:29
How can you deny the possibility of something that has already happened?

The sticky was recently updated and has a lot of good info. 
One thing not on the sticky that new users should understand is how change addresses work. 
I would recommend electrum wallet to new users as it is lightweight and has easy backup
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:05:49


Isn't this a pretty retarded thing to say when all you do is post in bitcoin subs all day?
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:25:54
You need to be able to predict the future to know that people aren't going to mine for free?
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:48:46

@_date: 2015-05-18 21:57:21
That would not work. I haven't seen a news article written by someone that understands the tech well enough. Most including the one you linked too shows little to no knowledge beyond what they have been told by someone else. Much like not understanding why you need a token to align incentives escapes them, this idea of using the tech without bitcoin is just a continuation of their lack of understanding.

They would have the least efficient transactional network and they would go out of business.

I doubt that.

@_date: 2015-05-21 21:01:40
Correct. Here's the claim:


@_date: 2015-05-26 18:12:33


No it isn't. We have the understanding that fees **are** economic controls, because they work, along with the block reward to align the incentive of the miners over time. They're not just DoS protection. They are necessary for the existence of this decentralized blockchain.
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:58:14
TBD isn't good enough. People need clarity when talking about something that requires economic participation. Every TBD limits bitcoins potential reach by 90%.
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:25:24
I don't know who this guy is but


is about all the information I need to measure the weight of his opinion
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:44:40
The blockchain exists only for decentralization. A centralized blockchain is redundant by definition.
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:34:50


Knowledge (or lack of it) is a barrier. Bitcoin has much of the misinformation the early internet did, something that a site like facebook wouldn't have.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:06:36


Some people are trying for this and it is ultimately self defeating because the utility of an opt in network like bitcoin is proportional to the its number of users. If people try to restrict the bitcoin blockchain to 3tps all that happens is that people move away from it and find a new blockchain that allows them to participate cheaply.
@_date: 2015-05-21 20:45:24


And you have?
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:53:21
If that's true then what is the incentive to mine when the block reward becomes negligible?
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:19:47


It also doesn't mean that it is. Like you say you have to go on merit. People that shout ponzi aren't wrong because of metaphors, they are wrong because they are calling something a ponzi which by definition isn't.
@_date: 2015-05-19 03:12:55
I don't believe anyone could be as willfully ignorant as this guy, I think he is trying to cash in by being the next Professor Bitcorn. Luckily he's not very good at it.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:12:30


That isn't a blockchain, that's a database.

Having him on side is big and a lot of his ideals are compatible with bitcoin. When he talks a lot of the mainstream listens. The only problem is that Max is going to whisper sweet nothings in his ear, and either through ineptitude or malice going to walk a group of the collective public into a pump n dump altcoin fiasco, ultimately setting bitcoin and crypto back who knows how many years

In fairness it was only linked to from r/bitcoin after about 8 hours, where it was already a top thread there with a lot of discussion. I'd imagine there is a lot of overlap of subscribers with bitcoin and futurology. I know I'm subscribed to both and commented there before it was linked to from here.
