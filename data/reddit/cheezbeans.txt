big daddy bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-08 00:59:11
Wow so many boring people writing in here
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:13:50
you really don't know if there will be a malicious hack or exploit in bitcoin or eth that could affect the price. There's also regulations and uncertainty.
@_date: 2018-09-22 10:41:11
@_date: 2018-09-21 08:54:01
I think the price is rising because it wasnt rejected
@_date: 2018-09-22 10:48:34
This is actually scary, there needs to be ways to protect and reassurevpeople they’re not going to lose everything. What if theres another serious bug they havent found yet and a malicious hacker finds it first?
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:14:53
Please let the dump happen during a bull market

@_date: 2018-09-06 12:50:50

@_date: 2018-09-21 10:03:49

@_date: 2018-08-29 02:43:45
Where? Until i see rollercoaster man i’m not impressed
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:12:32
Wow, thats incredibly risky
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:16:41
Lol so true
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:12:17
its only a matter of time until the price catches up to all the incredibly bullish news the last few weeks.
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:27:29
Yes this is actual adoption of cryptocurrency as payment, similiar to what vitalik was saying
@_date: 2018-10-27 22:47:18
You can’t really use Excel on a mac
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:21:31
Too bad steve isnt alive to see the blockchain, wonder what he wouldve done with it
@_date: 2018-10-28 00:05:53
They only did that recently and i think you have to pay a subscrption fee
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:55:21
Well to be fair, Microsoft does the same thing
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:07:43
Which software is restricted to macs?
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:33:20
Well i’ve never used or needed that on windows. But if you want to use Excel on a mac i think its harder to do. But i dont know because I dont have a mac.
@_date: 2019-02-21 02:38:57
Its not even 4000 yet
@_date: 2019-02-18 23:51:53

@_date: 2019-02-22 00:32:06
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:46:17
Ohh cool, i never thought about starbucks in tokyo
@_date: 2019-02-19 00:28:44
oh i see, then i would ask your dad to open an account and buy it under his account.  
@_date: 2019-02-16 13:37:11
It sounds like something an kndian would say
@_date: 2019-02-15 18:49:30
Im thinking about applying at JPM? 
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:51:26
Oh, tganks for lettung us know
@_date: 2019-02-22 08:19:31
Yeah and i’m pretty sure millenials would trade crypto for avocado
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:33:27
@_date: 2019-02-18 23:50:09
you could try coinbase but not sure if they let kids buy bitcoin, but you could have your dad buy it for you.
@_date: 2019-02-20 12:59:21
So why was he acting like he knew nothing and wanted no part of bitcoin for years?
@_date: 2019-02-22 09:02:09
I read the post and opened a bag of cheetos
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:42:41
Was that a thing?
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:10:55
He was already wrong about his 5k by new years prediction
@_date: 2019-02-17 12:49:43
Hes making things worse
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:38:10
Millenials beleive in avocado more than crypto
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:16:38
Mo money mo problems
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:00:35
Do you have to pay tax on gains when you buy with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:47:09
So his new years eve prediction is already wrong. Why are we still posting predictions?
@_date: 2019-02-18 11:55:45
What is the op doing?
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:32:48
I wouldnt mid the price dropping if its the crazy coin holders like faketoshi because then we can get them out
@_date: 2018-11-09 14:11:36
Because of the futures launch everyone expected that something big would happen but nothing really happened with the futures launch so people started selling
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:38:14
Where, thats my old car
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:59:35
He finally gives up predicting, lol
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:21:36
In other news...i ate beans today
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:27:31
No one beleives in hodl anymore, we all would have been better off if we didnt hodl
@_date: 2018-11-14 13:01:35
Wow how did he manage to run with his pants down?
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:44:05
The best thing that could come out of this crash is that craig wright and roger ver sell most of their bitcoin to buy or fund bitcoin cash. They no longer have any influence on bitcoin and can cry and whine about their bitcoin cash and how no one wants to buy it.
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:39:42
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:48:06
thank you. My brother brought this up today as a reason why bitcoin is bad.
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:27:39
This is interesting if it happens
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:43:15
What the? He says we will not live to see 100k because robots..
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:55:28
Do you really think baakt is just going to give up and say oh well crypto is dead, we tried?
@_date: 2018-11-09 23:26:05
I am fully braced
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:57:28
I don’t uinderstand the hate either, coinbase is where i first bought btc in 2013 when there were no other user friendly exchanges. I’ve never had any issues since being a customer since 2013. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:08:17
What about fake satoshi, i think hes the one that caused the dump
@_date: 2018-11-12 15:43:36
This looks cool, would love to see it on a website. I have no clue with charts and this summarizes nicely
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:53:47
Piece if shit is too nice of a word to describe him
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:59:00
um we already had a futures launch and it crashed the market
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:54:27
apparently this is one of india’s brightest

@_date: 2018-11-28 09:04:38
Happy anniversary!
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:35:14
No. It will be long and painful
@_date: 2018-11-17 09:45:04
You don’t need no woman
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:13:52
Whats going on, is this because of fake satoshi?
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:31:40
Please save us bagholders
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:46:45
Hmm and what if its denied?
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:51:00
Well is he going to eat something? If not then your prediction doesnt count
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:43:19
My tshirt says ‘hodling since 2013’
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:23:22
@_date: 2018-11-10 02:09:23
Yeah i realize now what a huge mistake i made. Maybe it was greed or hodl, but i couldve bought a place for myself. Now it could be years.
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:15:59
You’re an idiot, btw did you pay taxes last year?
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:46:36
The best thing that could come out of this crash is that craig wright and roger ver sell their stash in order to fund bitcoin cash. They no longer have any influence over bitcoin and can cry and ehine about bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:45:11
This isnt ethtrader
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:11:50
My guess is the arrogant satoshi wanna be craig wright selling some of his load
@_date: 2019-01-28 14:25:46
I declined the agreement because i wanted to close my account. After I declined the account was deactiviated but i couldn't delete it. so thanks for deleting it.
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:20:43
Is that james franco?
@_date: 2018-11-03 01:49:03
Winklevii dont lie
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:44:38
The sooner we hit the bottom the better so we can go back up
@_date: 2019-01-24 02:05:39
They also are less likely to get approved if baakt isnt running first
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:54:01
@_date: 2018-11-10 03:24:07
Thanks for that reminder
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:15:48
What about a worldwide debt crisis, that would be interesting.
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:56:08
They are also known masturbators
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:58:55
Or reply with ‘send bobs’

So cypto just comes out of your wallet
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:55:05
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:39:37
Fake satoshi, jihan, roger ver are the original crypto cancer trifecta
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:51:10
there are too many bad actors involved in bitcoin simply because they got in early.  It's just as bad as the centralized banks because they're driven by greed and power.  If they truly believed in decentralization then they would fade away like satoshi did, but these guys are a black mark on crypto and bring as much negativity and drama as wall street executives.
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:58:16
you mean because of the -50 windchill?
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:28:59
How does it affect bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:24:19
it's either him or the asian looking guy with dark glasses
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:53:40
it's not a meltdown, it's a nerd war and we are all just watching it
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:27:24
But the can just make more big macs and devalue it
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:13:40
Fork this craig wrong
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:07:40
Why are rapists and people that rob and assault let out to roam the street and this guy that hasnt harmed anyone is serving life.
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:04:59
Where is yhe evidence?
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:41:23
considering a possible debt crisis, your money is safer in bitcoin than fiat
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:30:40
Come on you nerds, you can do better than this
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:19:30
What the nerd is this
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:08:53
You just got into crypto and already suck
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:30:58
They wouldn’t build it if there wasn’t interest especially since CME has already done it
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:44:45
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:07:20
I doubt that guy will make it
@_date: 2018-12-03 06:54:28
Sometimes timing is off fir predictions because you know what the fundamental value is but the price doesn’t match because of investor sentiment or any # if things, so i think his timing is off and he shouldnt set a date for his prediction, but we’ll see
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:14:15
Yeah and I don’t get why people bash other people for making money when they themselves are trying to do the same thing
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:29:39
You mean bitcorns
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:48:35
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:06:09
Great post, you seem like a great guy too, you brought up interesting points i hadnt thought if. I’m buying as well and i think we will do well. Ignore the haters that are jealous of your buys. Ialso like how you call it bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:34:27

My booty is sore
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:15:32
Wow, sounds pretty disgusting
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:10:49
Yeah its interesting to hear other peoples reasons for not buying bitcoin. I want to open their eyes but they need to figure out for themselves.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:00:19
Bitcoin train has started
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:21:33
This dude probably crashed the market
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:09:37
All i see is you butt
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:37:49
I agree
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:08:49
Shiett instituitional takeover? Was that why bitcoin was created?
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:04:59
If he wanted to sell he woulve sold at 20k
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:21:59
Until she capitulates we’ll be going down more
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:59:16
Wall street wants in on this
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:55:00
Any 65 year olds on reddit buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-06 09:33:33
Why is it they can print more but one dollar is still one dollar?
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:14:16
But what about all the financial institutions getting involved with bitcoin? They shorting themselves?
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:09:20
What about futures?
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:15:10
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:18:54
Imagine if Bitcoin was never invented. what would people do? run for gold, no one knows how to buy gold and store it.
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:46:07
Craig wright
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:42:01
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:49:29
remember to cash out some this time when we get around 35 to 40k
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:12:53
I love this movie
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:29:34
At first i thought it said bitcoin futures
@_date: 2018-12-03 13:20:51
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:14:29
Thanks for sharing, you took a risk and it couldve gone either way, unfortunately theres a lesson to learn for all of us
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:00:32
But therrs bitcoin cash, bitcoin cash sv, bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:44:22
craig wright?
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:34:51
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:04:53
If he was looking to dump his bags he would’ve done so at 20k
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:40:56
Enjoy the red dildo while it lasts
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:42:03
Its alright, just stop predicting and go do something else.
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:44:47
Makes sense since the decline started happening after the futures launch which everyone was so excited about around here.  
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:09:43
its a christmas tree
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:14:16
His first post ‘nour’
