If you aren't comfortable with people who don't jump through legal hoops to open an exchange you always have the option of not using their exchange.
Why are you in favor of limiting people's options, raising prices, and creating a corporatist environment where who you know is more important than how well you can code.
Do you really think Ben Lawsky or any of those bastard regulators can tell someone who can sufficiently build an exchange? Their approval is the last thing I will look for.

Hi there,
I'm sorry for the trouble! I saw you had some ordering difficulty earlier and I can appreciate how frustrating that must be. At this point we've whitelisted your account - this means your transactions will no longer be flagged as high risk.
Sometimes an order can be cancelled by our anti-fraud algorithm if it hasn't yet identified your account as a trusted payment source. However, now that we've made this manual review you shouldn't have any problems going forward when buying or selling bitcoin.
Again, my apologies for any undue stress this has caused you. I hope this helps!

No, you're incorrect. You can't predict the "true" value because it is solely dependent on supply and demand.

People want to see something they can know what it is, they can define it, touch it and put in their pocket. If you do not have a computer and someone running the computer and calculations, you don't have it. I am not a big supporter of that, but I am not opposed to it. I admit, I do not fully understand what is going on with it."

There are about 30 threads about this. Gox is stuck in a loop. ZERO trades are occuring on Gox right now.

It's called arbitrage, do it and the prices will come closer together. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:44:47
BTC China is almost $100 over Mt. Gox. 
It could be said that the other exchanges are really trailing behind.

Before exploring bitcoin with him you should inform him that FUCK APPLE

This is incorrect, the source code can be modified to allow for more if needed. In that sense, it is infinitely divisible.

Download another client or use a paper wallet.

They are necessary. You can't have wide adoption and a small market cap.

To be fair, it would've been worth it if you took $59,000 and 100BTC
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:45:32
It's certainly possible. Assuming you are in the U.S. Coinsetter would be a very good option for you once they finish their beta testing and allow ACH transactions.

Given the fact the bitcoins can be used as a currency everywhere, their total market cap can eclipse the total market cap of the USD is what I was getting at. 
If America was responsible for 33% of the worlds wealth, bitcoins market cap could potentially be 3x higher than the USD's.

Mt. Gox happened.

What does that have to do with anything I said?

I live in an apartment, it's $400 a month. How do I get $200 a credit? I take my total tuition costs and divide it by my number of credits? $6000/year = 30 credits x $200

The average lifespan of a fiat currency is around 40 years. It is far more likely that the USD is obliterated before we die than it is to still be strong before we die.

Volvox, given your superiour knowledge and amazing ability to calculate consumer demand, I'm going to try to nominate your for the next chair of the Federal Reserve.
We need our central planners to be able to escape the economic calculation problem and you are the perfect person for the job!

I've never even thought about separating genders when it comes to bitcoin involvement. 
Isn't it odd that a list of women in bitcoin only generates 4 results? I don't have the time or energy to make a list for men in bitcoin. 
Why does it even matter? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:30:58
That's not actually what China said. And even if it were, there are still good aspects to it.
1. Bitcoin is not just a currency, taking it's use as a currency off the table will lead to develop in bitcoin as a transaction network and a public ledger of ownership. The use of bitcoin as a currency is a function of the latter two uses of bitcoin.
