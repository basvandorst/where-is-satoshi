I can totally call it that and hope you don't notice.

No. You can redirect in Windows as a feature where to check for updates. This is an extremely handy feature to have your enterprise check your own update server. The software you all can download to publish your own updates is WSUS. 
Once you get your foot into the machine and break sandbox to gain administrator it's a simple registry key to change. 
The title is sensationalism on the windows Update part.

I can just point it to a support page at MS.  If you want to check you need to review installed updates and check for stuff like KB numbers repeated and checking the signing on the downloaded packages. 
Odds are also the CIA doesn't care to take over your machine. You're not that important probably. If you actually suspect compromise you need to trash the drive and start over. Hell you might even need a new machine of they put on bad bios.   
Thing is now that we have a ton of zero days that Wikileaks should have reported to the vendors first and given them 90 days to fix so everyone can't do it. If they didn't do that Wikileaks just fucked us all for publicity and they can go fuck themselves.

What ever I filled into the update and if I put a self signed cert into your trusted publisher I could make it look like MS signed it till you closely inspected the chain. 
 You want defense? Don't run as administrator account. Instead run as standard and when the UAC prompts you login with admin account.  Most exploits are defeated this way because even if you gain access to the machine you might not have gained an admin or system level permissions.   It adds another layer to your security onion they need to peel away.

Yes. It's like saying I'm hacking by opening regedit

You are right. Just download WSUS and you can push out your own Windows Updates.

They replace the Microsoft one with WSUS. You still get your MS approved updates or turn off the one that seals the exploit. Or close it if you are already in so someone else can't in. The windows Update part is sensationalism.  They are using features of windows management not coding a replacement.

Own experience and know how. I can and have literally pushed out my own software using WSUS or Windows Updates as end users know it.  You have to sign the updates but that isn't a big deal if you get in the machine. You can install your own code cert into the trusted publisher if you gain control.

No, the updates in WSUS are assigned GUIDs. The name is just for humans to read.

Bitcoin is a currency and I can buy currency with a credit card. That's the fuss. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:53:22
I'm still able to buy currency with a credit card. If I can go to an ATM and get cash I'm buy cash with a credit card. I can even get checks.

It's like he doesn't know that the dollar is mostly used because of stability. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:10:54
And it's still using a credit card to buy currency. Just because the terms change doesn't change the fact I just used unsecured credit to buy cash. Now excuse me while I buy currency sheets from the US Mint with my Mastercard.

Commas can be used to show a pause for effect.

That's bad grammar. The ellipsis is for omissions of words. Usually in a quote for a section that isn't important.

Do you like how I used it to quote you?
