Sounds like i need an escrow wallet and some code to broker the transaction.... was hoping for something turnkey 
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:49:50
Yes love town is shitty

Fuck Facebook. They are all about monetization and ownership of personal data.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:28:56
Stop telling other people what to do with their money. That's a jerk move.
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:41:30
The display frame is damn ugly. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:05:13
Yeah that's obvious 
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:51:20
Childish film clip.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:56:28
Markets usually price such events in early. The fact that everyone expects it to bump is a tell.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:20:49
Only owns 1. Interesting.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:24:20
I don't link it. Just not my taste.
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:15:12
It's too weak a pun I just ignored it.

Handies are cheaper lad

Late to the game.

Lol liar. Blaming the US for his cluster f 
@_date: 2019-11-22 07:01:43
Yep, his "investment" was rekt. 
Rule of 2019....don't buy BTC above 8k.
@_date: 2019-11-22 07:01:36
and...I was right. How is that 2k loss treating you.
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:51:27
Or don't get a gf period. Pay for play once a week to rent different models as required. Cheaper long run. No body should have a gf until you are 30. It's a waste of resources. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:49:31
In all honesty, I've done well enough to retire and pay my own way until I pass. My businesses and consumption will continue to pay taxes that flow into the welfare system. We should all aim to be financially independent  
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:10:29
Cool. I hodl and spend. Everyone should do the same. Hodl to invest. Spend to ensure your investment grows.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:42:33
Let's just hope btc is that version of the future.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:58:40
R3 is doomed and that is great news. What a disaster.
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:59:43
No... you want to profit from those who don't understand probability. Imo that is a business only a scumbag would create. 
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:29:56
We got two.
@_date: 2018-06-16 08:56:57
Anyone know a JavaScript library that can produce a chart like that?
@_date: 2018-06-12 06:40:47
So true.. Thanks for reminding me of my obscene white privilege 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:19:26
Wow a login page!

Euthanasia is legal in Holland. At 70 I'm checking out. I've planned to fit my retirement goals into my 40s 50s... come that age there will be nothing led to do...so pull the plug.

Ah Wakanda, a fictional place created because after 2k years of human history there isn't anywhere else worth basing a film.
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:05:48
Wow....at least 1 third of the world was surveyed. What a believable study!
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:31:52
Get lost. Do something useful for humanity not this bs . 
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:09:08
Litecoin halvening did not move its price. Also reduced hash power due to lower miner profitability. Food for thought.
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:19:36
You are a idiot. Speculating on credit....what a dope.
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:54:07
Asset means capital gains tax which means it's not suitable to be used as a currency.
Fees are price volatility are present issues that may be resolved long term.
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:14:27
It will revert back to support.
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:16:34
You bought at the worst time IMO. You're about to lose \~2k
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:20:06
Yes yes again.... this is normal. Exchanges trade high volume.

I could live off my companies' cash savings in most US cities comfortably for the next 10 years should I choose to. Yet i choose to re\-invest my time in my business. Why? Because successful people always want more. Maybe one day you'll understand what I am talking about. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:01:07
People don't do anything unless there is personal gain. Naive.
@_date: 2019-04-24 23:13:24
Speculation... nothing more
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:39:50
You sound like pirates. Argh matey

Inspired font choice.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:29:47
It's unjust that we have government created inflation and bank created credit devaluing our meagre life savings. I want to see the end of manipulation and fractional reserve lending.
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:16:00
For those of us who have chosen not to have children I'm tried of paying out tax welfare benefits to those that do. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:08:19
Can you list all the business you used to pay only bitcoin?
Assume flight and hotel were fiat?
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:15:21
Yeah welcome to the real world 
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:59:13
Yeah bs. Destined to remain a laggard.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:55:36
Up on weak volume though. Where is the big money support? I suspect the dump will continue. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:48:48
I also wish to know 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:41:21
I think most are familiar with standard journalism to understand the obvious.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:27:36
Regardless of whether you are correct. Your 2nd analogy makes you sound like a twat. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:55:18
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:12:54
The price can and will go lower. Mainstream isn't this year. Until then expect volatility.
@_date: 2018-07-07 11:06:06
No. Already priced into market.
@_date: 2018-07-07 11:04:07
Don't even pretend you are positioned to give financial advice. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 11:09:11
Treat btc like gold. Hold it during a crash. If everyone does the same...it will hold value as it's seemingly uncorrelated. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:35:02
I think naive. Must hodl

Personal pizza us only?
@_date: 2018-04-09 08:59:51
Just use bots. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:46:24
It was pumped to dump. Get used to it dropping.
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:41:10
Is that you Nelson?

Hard to say what anyone's gender is these days 
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:55:52
Its all downward pressure for now. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 08:48:04
Decentralised crowd loans 
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:36:00
I invest ~35k into charity a year. That's the proportion of my tax paid that the government specifically redistributes into welfare. 
It's bs.
  
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:32:31
Struggled to hold 8k.... so I guess it's a good chance of falling back to 7
