I don't think most people will do much shopping around when it comes to who you select to process transactions. People don't know how bitcoin works as it is. The flat fee per transaction will be low enough that I don't think people are going to notice or even care as long as it is fast, easy and above all much cheaper then credit card transactions. For the sake of argument can't we take that control away from the transaction processor(middleman) and make the transaction fee a value that's based on a network variable? For example a small percentage of what it costs to process on the block chain.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:02:18
If lightning Network is introduced won't it become way more profitable to be the middle man between the block chain and the transactions? It wont take nearly as much equipment or electricity as it does to mine and even though you might be making less per transaction you will have more and more transactions as people get involved in bitcoin. It seems like if your in this bitcoin game then segwit is your golden ticket. That is if lightning network allows middle men to charge for their services.

Conceptually yes, you could make a proof of work ledger for real life assets. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be that simple and it would basically just be a public record of who owns what and how much they bought it for. It would rely completely on people updating ledger whenever they buy and sell something. Bitcoin keeps this process honest as the history of each bitcoin can be traced back to when it was first mined. This wouldn't be the case in your scenario as assets and the fiat value that they were bought/sold for would appear randomly in the ledger and should someone not report to the ledger/blockchain then all accountability would be lost.

Multiple events are coming to a head for bitcoin. The long awaited announcement from the SEC on whether or not they will approve a bitcoin ETF is to be announced this week which will somewhat legitimize bitcoin from finance, legal, and investor point of view. Which brings me to the price that is dancing around all time highs (ATH). All this is bringing more new people like yourself into the bitcoin world. Because of this, the technology is having a problem scaling to met the demands. There are mainly two proposed solutions. Segregated witness and bitcoin unlimited. One of the largest mining pools decided that bitcoin unlimited was more profitable and implemented it without notice to the community or the development team basically trying to hijack the block chain and force everyone's hand into using bitcoin unlimited. a large portion of the community including the development team has been preparing to implement segregated witness for a long time now. It is all going to be playing out this month. So I hope that helps you understand a little bit better what is going on. it is a pretty brief synopsis as the situation is more complicated but I couldn't really find any links that did any better explaining how all these things are correlated. By all means surf around to get better insight as to what all this means and join in on the fun.
@_date: 2017-03-09 03:36:12
Well its quite a week to be a new comer. Things are very tense in the community right now but please don't let that scare you off. If there was ever a time and place to see shit hit the fan now and here would be the front row. So sorry if you catch some shit but the show is just getting started. News and developments are happening so quickly in the bitcoin world recently so grab a poncho and enjoy the ride.

So you can't just use any hash. Miners need to hash the previous blocks 256-bit hash and find one with the appropriate leading zeros? 
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:46:57
I suppose that would be the truth. I am just surprised there isn't some kind of precedent for this by exchanges yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:16:06
This makes the entire reasoning behind bitcoin cash pointless. 2x would completely kill bitcoin cash. I don't think we should increase the block size so soon but frankly if this is what it takes to unite the community. We should never need more then 8MB a block and if bitcoin cash has proved anything its that big blocks can lower transaction fees.

@_date: 2017-08-21 19:39:48
No evidence that its not censored. I suppose one could argue that any kind of moderation is censorship. FUD is censored often but ive seen people criticize core or segwit all the time. It just usually more productive conversations then someone claiming that there is some conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:20:28
Bitcoin Core isn't completely against increasing the block size. They just don't think that we should do it now. They want to get segwit activated and they want to see what lightning network will be capable of. That way we can figure out how big blocks should be. Bitcoin will need bigger blocks that much is certain but why upgrade before you know what you need.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:42:40
Okay, that sound right. Even if you pre-mine multiple blocks using your own hashPrevBlock and tried to get lucky to win a block in real time. you couldn't inject your blocks because they wouldn't have the correct hashMerkleRoot from the block you mined in real time and it would be to hard to predict which block you got lucky on for the hashPrevBlock.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:39:51
That article admits that the laws are ambiguous. Some people will fight the government on it and most likely win but it will be costly. Bitcoin will eventually be classified as money and when that happens people will just run their lightning nodes out of the country. Plus if bitcoin explodes there might be so many lightning nodes that the government couldn't possibly prosecute them all. It will be interesting to watch this all play out.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:57:19
I have heard people mention this before but I do not understand. Are you saying that it is functionally 8mb by efficiency of segwit? Or is it a actual 8mb block increase? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:43:07
Did they finally nail down when segwit was going to be fully functional?
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:52:52
I understand all that its all a power struggle and that increasing block size would constrict full nodes to those who have high bandwidth but 2x will weaken bcash ideological position and pull miners away who only care about profit in the first place. Internet speeds and computing power will catch up with bigger blocks.
You definitely make a good point about the transaction fees. I just think we all will benefit from resolving this divide in the community quickly. There is so much more work to be done with bitcoin tech. Look how long it took to get segwit and that is a very simple change to the structure of a block. Not to say that it doesn't have many upsides.

I would put all of it into bitcoin. Hopefully push that needle to 5000 ATH. Then let the FOMO carry it the rest of the way. Pull some miners back into bitcoin. Then slowly diversify into other crypto. I know if I won the powerball i would be dead in a month if I didn't do something with that money immediately.

Miners accepted the activation of segwit with the contingency that in November bitcoin would upgrade to 2 MB blocks. It was a compromise between the interests of those who mine bitcoin and those who run bitcoin nodes. Some of the miners separated and started bitcoin cash which uses 8mb blocks. 
Miners already have a big block option. So the whole point of a 2 mb increase is kinda pointless. Since miners and switch between the btc chain and the bcash chain whenever they want.

Think of it like a book with an alternate ending. everything that came before the ending is the same as the original book they just changed the last chapter. So if you have read the original book you dont need to reread the whole book to understand the new ending. If you held bitcoin in the original "book" then your bitcoin will also be in the "book" that has a new ending.

Now with segwit we should really be seeing other developers coming up with competing LN technology or even just layer 2 technology that has utility. Open source software always divides into different development teams but now with the possibilities of multisig we can see competing L2 developers while the block chain remains compatible between them. This is why I think segwit will help decentralize bitcoin further.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:39:19
So then we just have to wait and see what FinCEN rules on the lightning network.

You have to understand that their is more then one way people speak about centralization when it comes to bitcoin. This article is referring to the logical topology of the network. When we talk about centralization as in who has the most control or influence over bitcoin it is a different topic all together. 
With the growth of the bitcoin protocol will come large business trying to find there place in it and it will also mean that there will be some garage band business that make it big. The best way to keep it decentralized is by making bitcoin so big and have so many use cases for the technology that it wouldn't be possible for any one organization to control it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 19:23:31
So many people compare the development of the internet to bitcoin as do I . I think the development of ipv6 is a good analogy. It's a better protocol that is basically a soft fork for the internet. 
You are right there are many examples of betamaxed technology I just wanted to point out that everything in bitcoin existed before bitcoin and all it takes is the right person to glue shit together.

Why doesn't this already apply to people who already run nodes or miners that verify bitcoin transactions? They are processing transactions as well.

Most people have no fricking clue how bitcoin works they depend on enthusiasts like us to guarantee them that it does. If someone figures out a new coin that has better tech I'll buy it and other enthusiasts will too. Generally people dont have a clue what they are buying just look at the ICO craze. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:44:50
The more people hodl the less bitcoin there will be in circulation. The less bitcoin in circulation the more valuable it will become. the more valuable it becomes the more people will buy it. the more people buy it the more awareness it gets. the more awareness it gets the more people will use it.
Honestly, bitcoin as a currency for 1st world nations isn't likely. Any country with a valuable, stable currency has no  reason to use bitcoin as day to day currency. That doesn't mean that their wont be other use cases for bitcoin. It can still be used as a backbone for card purchases like it is with swift or bit pay which is like day to day currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:44:19
We will have a couple of years optimizing the block space but we will need to start figuring out exactly how big block should be soon. If segwit is any measure of adoption it could be a very long time before their is consensus on block size adoption. Let us all hope segwit and lightning network will be able to scale for the next bitcoin craze. Then we have to plan for world wide adoption. It never happens fast enough.

Bitcoin is here to stay that I feel confident in. You can never predict what some new cryptocurrency could introduce. Bitcoins proof of work is what made it what it is today and that was a combination of already existing cryptography. All it takes is one person with a better idea.

Lightning network would allow full nodes to collect some fees for participating in the transfer of bitcoins.
Whiles full nodes do validation, but miners actually confirm whole blocks(groups of transactions). miners guess hashes until they find one that has the correct amount of leading zero's this happens rarely so when it does happen all the transactions in that miners block are written to the block chain. The rest of the miners can prove that he has the correct block by doing the hash themselves verifying the work. Since it is unlikely that more then one miner will guess a block at the same time only one group of transactions can be written to the block chain at a time. This prevents double spending and for their work they get to write on the end of their block that they get the reward.

Decentralization is the only thing that make Bitcoin stand out. While there is a major incentive to centralize it in one form or another doing so would destroy the very essence that drew people into it. The incentive is that decentralization is the feature everyone is capitalizing on. Without it there is no difference between Bitcoin and any other currency.

Yeah, I have all of my coins in coinbase still. Haven't had any problems yet but I also have kept them in "cold storage". I want to move them but fear having troubles doing so. Plus, I used coinbase based on this subreddit recommendation two years ago. So I don't know if I trust recommendations on where to store my bitcoin based on this community's suggestions. I know I can make my own wallet and store them myself but frankly don't trust myself to maintain my own wallet. I switch computers frequently, lose my removable media often, I change my passwords every month, and move apartments every year.
