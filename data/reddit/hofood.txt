Welcome to crypto, friend
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:51:56
I've still only got barely under 1k between all my coins but I also didn't start investing until about a month ago so, maybe I'll see you up there here in 6 months to a year.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:10:17
Don't feed the trolls

You obviously watch too little
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:11:16
 I imagine the stipulations were likely similar. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:52:23


While your sentiment has merit, the other side of the coin does too. No one knows where this will head so don't be so certain about being derogatory towards other's ideas. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:02:06
Or it could sit between 18k and 19,990 for the next 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:36:05
More like 11
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:18:39
It's been sitting at $19,000.00 flat for a couple minutes on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:05:31
I meant to type sending*. My bad. I guess it doesn't matter if I just transfer to GDAX. Thanks anyways!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:26:57
I agree
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:54:33
Diversity has to do with allowing for the increased statistical likelihood of any gain, not create the greatest potential gain. Its about lowering risk while still possessing the potential for return.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:35:00
Oh yeah, I totally agree. I'm picking up what you're putting down. I was just trying to make a joke, albeit a poor one lol
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:59:26
Oh man, that sounds like a good problem to have lol. I can imagine the stress. Thanks for the warm welcome!
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:24:46
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:39:14
I'm pretty sure I watch just the right amount as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:55:39
Also, I hope he doesn't transfer from Coinbase lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:19:06
H was mocking the bitcoin cash fork by saying he created yet another and claiming the same as the BCH creator in that it's the new or real bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:25:40
Just like your take on crypto, your metaphorical cents are worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:14:57
Ahh, you're just two letters off. Close enough, right?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:46:57
Correlation something something causation. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:21:30
Lmao, okay that's cool. This is the nature of investing in products with potential future application. There are so many unpredictable variable that it's generally best to toss some money in a couple of things you think have potential and cross your fingers. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:01:20
If you answer yes, no, yes: HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:58:58
At what point in the selling process does it ask you which fee you'd like? Genuinely curious. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:54:30
Somethin something bit-chin'
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:18:51
I just stuck in $20 4 days ago at $10k and followed up with another $50 when I saw it today. It's good to see these discussions as I've never messed with anything so insanely volatile before. I'll make sure not to spend all my current profit in one place. /s
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:13:39
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:46:39
The short term is a very real thing, you're right.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:29:40
For one of the uninitiated, what does that entail fortune market?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:39:55
I give it 10 more min
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:08:27
That's about my train of thought. I know, when in a dip, I really like buying while intoxicated. I generally hit my monthly investment cap in the first couple days if I'm partying lol.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:28:55
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:16:04
Okay, that's exactly what I needed to know. I really appreciate you taking the time to respond.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:14:02
Maybe OP has an investment plan or something laid out and is just being prepared. I've only got around $400 worth of initial investments in and I'm already snagging me a hardware wallet. Better safe than sorry and I honestly want to protect the time I've put into all this just as much as I do the money.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:09:42
Lmao, you'll be thanking yourself if it climbs even near what it was a couple weeks ago. Here's to 20k in 2018!
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:05:23
Very interesting. Probably a troll. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:53:14
I honesty thought you were from a non-American, English speaking country where toll was slang for a till lol.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:40:48
Is this r/wallstreetbets for crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:06:41
I am aware of that but I wasn't sure how the company operated so I'm just unsure as to whether he may have stored the coin in a wallet and just used mt gox or if the coming is absolutely unrecoverable. 
Thanks for the response though!
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:10:37
Fuckin' right!
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:19:59
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:27:01
Lol, I remember reading about graphene a couple years ago but never really heard about it after that. What ever happened to it?
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:56:04
I think people just had issue with the way you defined different amounts held. I could see some people taking it as you pushing an absolute definition when I think you were just supplying your own circumstantial context. I'm not entirely certain. 
As far as what to do with it, I'm not experienced in investments or anything but, depending on your age, I'd recommend starting by looking into retirement accounts. IRAs have some great long term benefits and are not a bad way to lay the foundation for an investment portfolio. Diversification is important and something like a Roth IRA can act as your lowest risk and the earlier you jump on that train, the better. Aside from that, maybe look into different types of property management if you have a knack for that? Or maybe look into a small franchising opportunity. There are these cool frozen yogurt machines as a franchise opportunity that have been advertising around my area in east TX. Maybe search out something like those? I personally plan on doing sub-lease rental housing in a college town for a couple years while I'm still in my 20s and building my financial foundation. It'll help slightly raise my annual income and, without going over 2 houses, shouldn't take a terrible amount of time away from work/life. 
Id say just search out things you believe in, things you enjoy, or things you think have the potential to produce decent return, research them to hell and back, then make a move. Stagnation makes no money.
I'm only 21 and I'm working my first job that makes over 30k a year so I'm the furthest from knowledgeable as you can get but if you pay attention to statistics involving risk/return, do your research, and don't make any decisions based on wants or feelings, you should be good. My father became a relatively wealthy business owner in my mid teens and I got a ton of exposure to other financially successful people around that time through him so I not completely blind on financial management. The most consistent factor I've noticed in people who maintain wealth is the mindset surrounding it.
