While it's always encouraged to remove your funds from an exchange, you have to compare the risk to the extra fees you pay now.
It would have been free if you could have waited. Assuming your birthday is very soon and/or the amount is low enough (relative to network fees), it would have been better to just ignore best practices and trust GDAX.

Transaction volumes are very close and Ethereum has huge momentum when it comes to gaining exchange volume compared to BTC. I don't mean to spread FUD. I have stakes in both Ethereum (more recent investments) but my 2016/2017 BTC I just HODL (probably one of the strongest hands. It could crash to $100, I would not care).
Right now the movement goes from fiat exchanges over to Binance (and more and more exchanges like Binance). I think Bitcoin's safety net right now is actually our scapegoat... Coinbase. People can't see it.
But if they did not pay my fees, why would I consider moving BTC to buy a new shitcoin? Man, even the expert advice is to use a different coin if I want to charge up 50 bucks of something right now. That's just what it is.
You should be bearish short term when it comes to Bitcoin. A lot of bright heads will use LN as an opportunity and make everything consumer friendly as quickly as possible.

It's sad to see that communities do not try to abide by reddiquette.






This concept of not understanding that people use Reddit less frequently than daily, registered users are (90% of r/Bitcoin's readers don't even have a Reddit account) is quite detrimental for Bitcoin. People like think everyone around them has the same context they do. If they don't, then they think they should have.
They'd rather we stopped participating entirely here. If we as Bitcoin advocates can't get along, how are we supposed to be anti-fragile?
I wish and would see eye to eye with me on this :(
Temperatures are getting higher and higher. This subreddit does not even mention reddiquette in the sidebar, it's no wonder we are calling each other names.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:39:05
No, because Bitcoin was designed around requiring a network consensus and the developers are an important part of that.
It's like asking "Was there ever a vote where the loser got elected?" (I can see how this is a really bad analogy. I'm leaving it here and am curious if someone will try to attack the flaw, finding a straw-man)
Of course not. That's not the point of the vote.
If you want to advocate for your point, a more sane approach would be to point out that even devs need to be a bit open minded to change. And it's not enough to just trust them, they too (despite their skills education and intelligence) would need to communicate their concerns adequately. Because they are not the only ones. There are companies and miners. And they need explanations.
So you could point out that you feel they don't adjust their believes often enough.
Because people might prefer the larger blocksize slightly. But they wouldn't prefer it *at all costs*. The design of Bitcoin is not "&gt;51% and deal with it" (which makes my analogy bad). It's that we want a general agreement. *Among ALL people*. Including the devs. Especially the devs. Bitcoin is nothing without its devs. People who say crypto has no intrinsic value don't understand where tech company's have their value lying.

Thing is, batching is far more important. An exchange without batching is as bad for Bitcoin as for BitCash.


But it's not like this can meaningfully be accelerated at this point ( as I understand). This part is almost done (as I read things). Gemini and Coinbase are probably wise to wait at least a few more days... (sorry for being Devil's Advocate).

You are missing one point. Incentive.
Why the fuck should Coinbase or Gemini implement SegWit? "40% fees"? They don't care about fees, they can't keep up with growth. Sure, great for Bitstamp. But they can't *at all* keep up with growth. Maybe they are just not greedy. But my verification has not gotten a response in a month.
Implementing SegWit is a risk. We are starting to hate on every wallet (rightfully so), but on businesses? They have their own interests. We chose to ignore them. Businesses can be far heavier advocates of moderate blocksize increases than even miners can be. Why should they care about Bitcoin in 30 years? In 60 years? They care about this year. And maybe the next 2-5 years.
So back to the point, why should any of them adopt segwit? It's quick to do. But there's no rush whatsoever for them. What they have is highly profitable. They don't *need* Bitcoin. We can make our own, decentralized exchanges.
Now add Lightning.
That's a gamechanger. If the promise holds up, they now have an incentive to do one investment into segwit *and* lightning. Suddenly they can offer a better service. A more competitive service.
LN is what exchanges need most. They don't care at all about segwit.

Am a physicist... what we do is not that different in data analysis and dissertations. Analyses will often have flaws.
It‘s the same thing with TA. Just it‘s really hard to do and you don‘t get right answers. It means that people not truly understanding anf breathing math/statistics/charting can **see anything they wish to see**.
Which makes it so that an overwhelming majority or players are fooling themselves.
But... under the assumption that things are static (no huge news or whatnot) you can indeed make some informed decisions. Did you see the Bitcoin Diamond arbitrage dump? The 1 min candle was just so explosive. It was jumping up and down. It was quite obvious that there was no equilibrium. Your statistical analyses would have indicated that stuff will explode either up or down very soon.
I wish people understood this. But scientists also look at graphs with particles coming from the sun and then try to see patterns. But the approach is far more analytical.
So yeah, TA is usually astrology. That can be a self fulfilling prophecy. But for some out there... it is not.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:44:51
Why don't you just say "I'm sorry I was wrong. You did indeed show me a non-segwit transaction for $5 and you were not talking out of your ass."?
I was right, you were wrong. Why do you feel the need to double down right now?
Bitcoin incentivizes miners and malicious parties to spam the network. There is a huge likelihood that to a good extent that is what happened. There are many effects, such as people transacting less due to the higher fees.
Bitcoin's mempool had its ATH at December 22 and has been going down for quite some time.
My point has held since December 25th last year. That's two and a half weeks. It's currently going down exponentially at a rate of &gt; 30% per week....
But hey. It's more important for you to be right I am sure.
Like, please go back to the root of this comment tree, read every comment and realize how pointless every single one of your comments was. Because we started with me stating what you wrote in 


(quite literally).
1. Even with segwit you pay $5 at least.
   No you are double wrong. Even **without** segwit you pay **less than** $5
2. You mention an anecdote (your $6 transaction being stuck since January second. Go re-broadcast it you smart ass)
  What's worse than your fucking anecdote is your cynical, sarcastic tone. Wipe that smirk off your face before it's getting stuck.
3. Your last comment is just pathetic. I won't even comment at that.
Again, please just abide by reddiquette and start adding to the discussion (or don't bother commenting). Now go back and delete your comments, because everyone is now a bit more dumb for having read anything you have said.

That's not entirely correct... it's quite complicated. ~ 2 or so days ago it was not 100% accurate to say "it's just missing from the GUI".
Here is a comment from ~ 1 month ago






To translate what is being said here, it's technically inside the CLI. It does indeed serve as a reference implementation for third parties. But it certainly is not in a state that we can say "It's all finished, we just did not implement it in the GUI".
It will come soon enough.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:25:06


I mean, when you are wrong, at least don't talk like a little bitch, ok?
They are all from the last block, as I was 100% sure the last block had non-segwit transactions under $3.
In the last block, there are 150 transactions (out of ~ 1800 transactions) that are at $4.60 or less fees. Non-segwit.
Most wallets set their fees to very high values. You are likely one of those very dumb users that uses a bad wallet and is dumb enough to pay $30-$50 fees.
Look, I heavily upvoted you in the past. Please start abiding by reddiquette again in the future, so comment threads don't derail like they just did.

Oh no, the two communities are at an all-out war. Always have been.
is heavily biased against BCH.
is heavily biased against BTC.
There are many lies on both sides. I am trying to stay as unbiased as possible here, I am (by now) a heavy advocate in favor of BTC and against BCH.
They promise you low fees (and try to persuade you that it's worth the downsides). They lie to you to make you believe that. Many are believing their own lies.
Other currencies have *no* fees. I don't think BCH has a leg to stand on long-term.
That being said, don't make investment decisions that are emotional/ideological. I used to hold equal amounts of BCH and BTC for a long time (and did not regret it). By now I dumped all my BCH.
The reason is simple: I don't believe in the project. I believe both communities need to come back together and be strong together. I blame their community for breaking consensus (maybe rightfully so, but they did indeed pull the trigger).
While it feels good if BCH gains some and you hold some, it's this depressing feeling when it goes down and you don't at all believe in the project.
I don't mind if a project goes down in price, where I believe in.
But this is nothing new. will blame for everything. (Including the moon rocket coming to a halt). This has been going on since the fork and is not going anywhere any time soon. Until BCH becomes irrelevant or people lose all patience with BTC (probably a subset of the most stubborn people there are).
It's harder and harder to find sympathy for I have years of Reddit moderation experience in heavily shilled/brigaded/manipulated communities where big money is on the line. I wouldn't be surprised if it's literally the same people that I have been banning in the past, now shilling this. To be fair, people in crypto seem to be more educated and more well-spoken.

Jamie Dimon says he “regrets” his now infamous criticism of bitcoin, in which he called the cryptocurrency a “fraud”.
The JPMorgan Chase chief executive on Tuesday softened the comments he made at a banking conference in September, saying in an interview on FOX Business Network, a US television station, that “I regret making them”.
Mr Dimon said that he personally is “not interested in the subject at all”. However, he said that blockchain, the ledger system that powers bitcoin and is also being used by an increasing number of companies for record keeping, “is real”.
He added that initial coin offerings need to be reviewed “individually”. ICOs in which investors pay in cryptocurrency for a company’s “tokens” have been the subject of fraud alerts from US regulators since they provide few investor protections.
Mr Dimon is one of the highest-profile executives on Wall Street. His remarks in September were met with anger from many in the cryptocurrencies community, but also echoed by other top executives, including Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive of BlackRock.

That's not possible with the way addresses are encoded. It is encoded in a way that avoids l vs. I and O vs. 0 conflicts. It also verifies automagically if what you entered is correctly (the last part of the address has to fit its main chunk).
If we are talking about four digits... you might want to invest into a hardware wallet as that makes the process fool proof. Both Trezor and the Ledger wallets are great investments.
Coinbase is not insured against bankruptcy or incompetence.
Also don't worry. You are not doing any harm *until* you send out your Bitcoins from Coinbase.
When you do, you can save fees by using GDAX (you are signed in to GDAX, when you sign into Coinbase).

Nothing is shrunk. We increased the blocksize but only let segwit transactions use the extra space. That way more segwit transactions can be put into a mined block, which allows us to pay lower fees for them.

The CNBC article listed Reuters as a source. Basically every news paper reports if Reuters makes an article. They are trusted.
I don't get why people get upset, though. You should dismiss Reuters as a source on South Korea instantly. It's the second time they do this short term when it comes to the same topic. I don't really believe in coincidences. I'm not saying they are making this up, but they seem to be at least heavily biased and have anti crypto tinted glasses on. Add to that that things probably get lost in translation easily. It's like trying to do TA when you have no clue what you are doing. You can see whatever you wish to see.
Do you guys know the story of the boy who cried wolf? This is a picturebook example of Bitcoin's antifragile nature. If people actually want to hurt crypto, they need to batch their attacks and not trickle out those news. This just makes every hand stronger.

So yes, these do get old. *For you*. I promise you a majority of users visiting this place don't even know what SegWit is. Heck, I'd go as far as to say that a majority of users that commented here don't know what SegWit is.
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:11:41
No, they don’t actually get smaller for primitive transactions. There is just effectively more space but only segwit adopters get to use it. The lower fees are an incentive for optional segwit adoption.

Sorry, bread wallet is too busy to create an ICO and their own token!
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:02:27
For me personally, that is a bit too little a bit too late.
In the past month or so I have only seen information about their new ICO and their special token. The app lost its minimalist charme.
I still have respect that they don't have Segwit. IMO that can wait a few more months even.
But you can't even adjust the fee. They use highly outdated (static?) fees and you can just select a normal fee or an express fee, both of which are way too high.
I get *why* they do this. They had a lot of complaints about transactions not pulling through.
Just my two cents :/ I loved the app. It was very little code on GitHub. Now development is done in private and everything feels different.
But good news is good news. After they implement Segwit, I will probably recommend them again.

If a new crypto wants to compete with Bitcoin, it has to put something new on the table.
There is a lot of doubt when it comes to Bitcoin Cash. We could all form a consensus and lower fees right now. It's the downsides they choose to ignore and that we worry about, why we vote against it.
The market is not entirely dumb. They see the warnings. They are not sure which side is correct. Heck, nobody is. But why should they settle with a niche, low-fee currency such as BitCash, when the experts say that it's only a matter of time until they have the same fees (or the downsides escalate), when there are zero fee currencies available?
You can argue that transactions cost a little amount of electricity, sure. But that's still a huge difference. It's like a promise. The hidden, intrinsic fees are capped by my power supply's maximum power times the time it takes to transact/do PoW.
The other currencies still have to pass any tests of being attacked. It will be a rough ride.
But I think you'd have to be a fool to bet on BCH. It's all or nothing, here. They are unironically advocating for TerraByte blocks today (every 10 minutes +1TB on the blockchain) while saying it won't hurt decentralization. Someone unironically saying that is as stupid as a person gets. The question is if they run out of marketing resources before the market loses faith in Bitcoin's ability to deliver in time.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:23:24
Be willing to miss out on opportunities man. This is way more fun if you don't get burnt short term. If people say Bitcoin is never on sale, they are new or lying.
Buy when there is blood on the streets. Charge up 50 bucks and put them on an exchange now and just wait. If nothing happens in 3-4 months, oh well. This is not a get rich quick scheme. It might. But be willing to miss out on opportunities! There are dozens around the corner. There are also many altcoins, that can co-exist with Bitcoin.
It might be overvalued at $9k. Who knows. But I'd bet you'd see it go above $10k again, if you bring enough time.

No Segwit. No batching. (Neither of those three)
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:27:19
You will not need to re-open balances down the line. The specification allows for you to update your balance. It's like everyone can roll their own prepaid credit card, if that makes sense.
Sure, ordering one has you pay an initial fee to VISA etc. But then you can just charge it up whenever you need.
Sure, charging up costs a transaction fee. But the idea is that Bitcoin's network will lose congestion as the bulk of the transactions can happen on Lightning's network.
Let's assume it doesn't, you can just charge your Lightning balance up using Litecoin. Lightning will swap your funds between currencies on the fly (atomic swaps) according to current exchange rates.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:12:58
I think non-segwit can go as low as 105 sat/byte which at 250 bytes is $2.5 - $5 (250 bits) for **non-segwit** at Bitcoin prices between $10k - $20k.
That's (AFAIK) $1.8 - $3.6 in segwit if we assume a 1.4 MiB effective blocksize.
Now a 100 sat per byte transaction is by no means guaranteed to clear. But I find that to be an adequate assumption, when we are making a channel for an entire year.
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:06:35

Why don't we cry for batching now?
There are legitimate reasons not to have SegWit yet. They are a business. It's not in their interest to invest in SegWit yet.
There is no excuse for any exchange out there not to do batching. It's even as problematic for Bitcash as it is for Bitcoin.
We needed batching yesterday, while segwit can even wait until tomorrow. Wait for the next Bitcoin Core release.

One should note that some might be secure *in theory*. But in enterprise, things need to be proven over a decade. I'm even careful calling Bitcoin secure, it's very abstract. The more years pass, the more inclined I am to call Bitcoin secure *in practice*.
Alts have a loooong way to go. Each and every one of them.
Scale, OK. I think some more centralized coins are past us.
So I'd rather say none at this *decentralized* scale and *proven* security. Hope that's fair.

You can't really say $6. The price changes all the time. Unless you tell us how big it is and how large the network fee was, this information is meaningless *even as the anecdote it is*.

One idea is that it needs to dip even lower, before it can bounce back. It could be in a bear market for a long time and then utility could catch up unseen.

If you really want to reduce fees, you can attempt a low priority transaction as soon as you lay hands on the TREZOR.
You'll be able to send the transaction &lt; 500 bits if you are a bit patient (and not in a panic). That's less than 10 bucks but could take days (or never go through - you do not lose coins though).
The only true way to save fees is to wait (whether your transaction is transmitted or not). Mempool seems to be stable / downwards going.
I wouldn't count on segwit adoption to actually reduce the fees. People like you will make use of doing transactions for $10 instead of $30.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:51:16
Of course it was. That's why companies tend to be on social media.

You will not need to see any of that. If what the experts plan will work out, you will not see any of that and your wallet will just abstract it away.
Again, the idea is that it will be really cheap. *Really* cheap (unless you need to charge it up ten times a day).
If it won't be, then people will not use Bitcoin for payments but another currency.

**Edit**: Sorry, this is where I chime in
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:49:43
You are asking me what defines a fiat currency? First off, you should not try to come up with a "definition" yourself or ask a stranger on Reddit. My area is physics, not economy. We have a lot of armchair experts, here.
That being said, fiat *money* is defined by being Government declared, state issued, intrinsically valueless (apart from being legally government declared).
There were three criteria (circulating around somewhere) that were necessary for something to be defined as a currency. (Store of value, medium of exchange were two I believe).
Wikipedia and Investopedia are great resources.
To come back to my point: I was not arguing anything. But mathematically "just being backed" is not the prerequisite to be "fiat". There are a few more requirements.
BTC can never be "fiat", that's just not what the word means.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:14:05
I was just talking about the "I wouldn't do it (unless)". You shouldn't even do it then, IMO.
A bank can have roles and permissions. Whatever happens, a banker does *not* have information to the client's secrets such as his PIN.
You should never trust an exchange that holds your *unencrypted* keys for you. If they claim to encrypt your keys with a passphrase, then you could consider doing that based on whether you trust them or not.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:49:20
I have a plan to repay debts and I have bankroll, though. So far, realizing gains cautiously seemed to have payed off. Debts are cheap, it's far less than 10% per year.
It's not as much a no-brainer as it seems.
Say I could flip a coin and get all my debt gone in 2018, vs. just 15% of it now... I don't know. It's not an easy decision.
I think the right answer is to reverse dollar cost average.
Having -5% or so in crypto seems not insane.

Religious/cultist behavior like that is hostile to the community. Their demands were absurd. In fact, reddit administration would interfere *with post like their's* because they were literally asking to unjustly spam administration, mistaking recommendation with rules and asking to brigade them, when their "issue" is not even part of an admin's domain.
It's this sub's mods that decide this. And they don't censor Ver for a reason, because that would give Ver leverage.

The USA has a *huge* GDP. And the lowest spending on non-Military. What you are doing here is the fallacy of a false equivalence. How much is spent **per GDP** between Russia and the USA is not remotely comparable. It's also whataboutism at its best.
I get it, though. It's a convenient manipulation to swallow and then propagate.
You **are** spending a metric fuck-ton on military and good job on the republicans to make you believe otherwise. You can always choose a metric that supports your narrative. But others will point out to you where you are being manipulated (or manipulative).
Let's look at military spending per capita and draw comparisons to Germany (small capita), China (biggest capita), Russia (big capita). That metric supports my narrative (I didn't even look at it, but I'm sure I'm not wrong).

**Disclaimer/edit** It's perfectly fine IMO to attack back and call the other community Bcash if you are advocating for BTC. But I will assume an author is biased if they do on a blog platform. I am advocating for neither, so to me it's "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin Cash" (or I do like "BitCash" personally but oh well. Guess that would piss everyone off)
If you mainly spend time here, it seems like it's an OK thing to do. Many people use it and don't mean bad with it.
**Short answer**: Bitcoin Cash advocates do not seem to like being called that.
**Longer extras**: As a respectful being that does not want to just shitpost, that is the end of the discussion for me personally. If I want to contribute something, I do so by not pissing off a big group of individuals by default.
To add some reasons as to why this is (and why I don't fault people too hard for acting out on either camp), the BTC community is pissed off for Roger Ver explicitly attacking. They are claiming the BTC name (which is a bit ridiculous right now, as they are still quite a bit away from BTC's market capitalization).
So it's like that worms intro where one worm pulls a sword and the next a gun and then the first worm pulls out a bigger weapon.
So because of that, people here try to not even give them the "Bitcoin Cash" name. They say it should just be called "b'cash". But nobody owns the name "bitcoin".
My opinion: Bitcoin Cash is not allowed to be anything that could be confused with Bitcoin. So no "Bidcoin" or "Bitcoyn". That's just a no-go. I would advocate heavily against them if they did that. But "Bitcoin Cash" is fine. Both camps are in the wrong. Bitcoin Cash shouldn't deceive BTC by claiming to be Bitcoin. Bitcoin should not deceive BCH by claiming they are not even Bitcoin Cash.
It's sad in the end. IMO BCH should really consider going their own identity. They are not just a copy. But they look like one.
What *I* can do is judge someone that runs/writes for a crypto blog. And then uses the words "Bcash". Because I know *exactly* where he stands on this side of the debate.
I get that the vocal people are either BTC or BCH advocates. But I try to be the reasonable "middle" if you may.
Sorry for the long text!

Absolutely not. Those two are entirely different things, down to concept, platform, goals, business plan. And there is something as moving too early. Facebook needed the rise of tablets and the everyday use of internet to be established.
Facebook was the first of its kind.
FB is **shit**. But it's not going anywhere. In business terms, it has an insanely thick moat. A "switching" moat. It's basically a toll booth. **And** as a platform it's bad in almost every way. It's hostile towards the user. FB did not replace MySpace because it was a better MySpace. FB was something else. FB did not even cater remotely to the same audience. I use Facebook to sell ads. I used MySpace to upload music.
Sorry, but you could not be more wrong, no matter how hard you tried.


God, please try to just read my last comment again. You are **entirely** missing it. Probably intentionally, but oh well.
You respond as if I said "Gold does not even have intrinsic value". But I said "I'm sure you'd say gold has some intrinsic value". Which you did. (Let me guess, next you will argue that you said "a lot". "Some" does not mean "little")


That's just incorrect. You couldn't be more wrong. And you just ignored the two points I made for that. I will not repeat them.

CB does not need to have one wallet per user. They could have many wallets per user or just very few for many users.
If you understand how UTXOs etc. work, then doing self-coded wallets at the scale of Coinbase can invite some effects normal users would only see long-term.
Right now it would seem that they can bypass a great deal of the technical limitations. Potentially through special deals with miners.

That's wrong.
"Scalability" is a term from systems theory. It's one generalization of IT. It applies to any such system.
There is administrative scalability, functional scalability, geographic scalability, load scalability, generation scalability and even more.
It's almost always IT specific, as such a vast number of systems run computerized these days.
You are just confused about the meaning. It's not a "but laymen use it like this" kind of ordeal. OP was right, you were wrong. The coin you are talking about might easily have a better scalability, that does not mean it's sufficient. "It scales" is a boolean term that's only adequate to use when something does scale sufficiently.
When you say something "scales" it has sufficient scalability. As otherwise it would not scale.
I learned it from my physics courses, a computer sciences has systems theory as well. An economist will learn about scalability as well (check investopedia).
It's a well-defined term. One that's only used in the context of systems theory (or maybe skinning fish? Scaling them?).
From Wikipedia: The other ways it's used are just even way more technical and specific (apparently a dentist does scaling, it's something people playing tricks with cards do as well)
The other way would be the reduction to mathematics. Mainly geometry.

You trust them.
You cannot know, if your operating system has malicious code dormant or if your CPU does.
As far as I know, you can use the Ledger fully offline, unless you want to send funds. At which point you could also just use the recovery seed to transfer your funds.
It is up to you to read up on all those things. It helps a bit to understand how wallets and digital signatures work and how wallets store and generate keys.
Sure, there could be malware in it. But I don't think it could be planted in a way that other people couldn't tell.
Anything can be cracked. Your iOS wallet can also be (in theory) be malicious. Hardware wallets and pre-compiled binary code are things that require trust.
Using paper wallets does not. In theory, you could use some lines of python and an airgapped device to create your paper wallets.
In the end it boils down to this: Your "paranoia" can be applied to most currently available wallets, unless you are a developer yourself. Most people focus on the outside parties that try to steal your wealth all the time. Such a device is without a doubt the safest thing to protect you from that after a paper wallet.
What's more likely? The creators of Ledger Wallet (who likely at one point invested in crypto currencies themselves and have a very successful product) are the big danger? Or is it the available malware, which those devices are *highly* resistant against?
Also, if they are really doing this systematically, how should they not end up getting caught sooner or later?
It's not difficult to trust them, considering chances are you have to trust *someone* (at the very least yourself).

To be fair, it does seem smarter to deal with big amounts of Bitcoin and avoid telegraphing the idea that Bitcoin could crash because of the same reasons that tulips crashed (people could no longer afford even a single tulip).
We do that in academia as well. We try to go for 3.7 or 0.37 and format tables so that they use a consistent unit.
The most important thing we should learn though is that when we use numbers we don't need as many digits... 18203.42 is needlessly accurate. People don't understand the issue is not the unit. It's the portrayed accuracy. They prefer 18.2 over it because it no longer carries the pointless information of "0342".
It's way easier to say the course of Bitcoin is at 18200 (in particle physics we round in tables, even if 18203.42 is the "better" estimate).
And frankly, going "course of bitcoin is 18.2k" is an equivalent symbol to saying "course of milli bitcoin is 18.2".

Even with debit cards?
For us, it greatly depends on the deal the vendor negotiates. Many small markets only accept debit cards when you buy 10€ or more worth of stuff.
Big chains are free for any amount even with debit cards. So is McDonald's. But people in my country hate anything that's not fiat cash. They don't like Bitcoin. They don't like banks. They don't do e-payments. They want their coins and bills.
In our neighbor countries it tends to be better. But people from my country tend to be scared to withdraw money or pay with debit cards because of the added 2-3€ fees. Stuff is getting better, though.

Hear me out. All exchanges are overloaded. Hardware wallets are sold out. Companies are overrun.
There is a huge backlog of people *trying* to get in. What are their motives? A vast majority of them is just *hyping* Bitcoin, and they all want to *buy* it.
That means the price is bound to go up unless some stuff happens. That's only *short-term*, though. The new players on the market are probably more short-lived and have fewer ideological motivations to join now.
But at least for the *short term*, it's probably one of the safest times right now to invest into Bitcoin. Add to that the price being down due to the initial CME uncertainty...
Good times. Hope I get verified by an exchange I currently trust so I get to ride the bull.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:55:02
Well, it's not the only exchange out there. And while I like their quality&gt;quantity approach, people will not wait forever. A huge dip can always happen. Binance is great and there are other exchanges that have batching already.
If you are new to exchanges, make sure you really understand the differences between trading and investing. An investor is not scared of a "big dip" in crypto currency. You are betting on the next years and not the next days.
A trader is also not scared of a big dip, but mainly because they see it as an opportunity.

**Edit** Coinbase went to $ 17 300 *while* I was writing this.
It's not going above that because people then decide to sell. Many do automatically.
There is no hidden secret value. There is only a current value, which is around $15k right now.
People that say it's overvalued are often the ones that would say it's a scam or will crash any moment. It could.
It would only be overvalued if you knew you could not sell it at will and current rates when you planned to.

I think the issue is with the name, mainly. Bit*coin* kind of suggests that it cannot be broken down so it is a very intuitive mistake to make.
But I think introducing a scale like in academics would only confuse people. mBTC / µBTC vs. all those alt names. How should my dad know, that DogeCoin does not mean 10^(-5)? Stuff is confusing enough as is.
The way to go would really be to do it *bad* and say something like 0.001 BTC are $16.
A new language would be coined by the average Joe, instead of coined from upstream.
Sure, they'd probably call that one bit. I kid you not. Even though 10^(-6) BTC are already bits. Even though some people don't like 10^(-6) BTC are already bits.
But average Joe came up with it and he explains it to average Jane after all, who sits at CNBC.

The big issue with a block size increase (and I want to add that I am new to this debate) is probably that it is a one-way-street. Once the blockchain gets bigger, it's bigger. There is no garbage removal.

Bitcoin is not anonymous, though. Other currencies are made for that purpose.
Bitcoin is pseudonymous. It's a bit like reddit and you saying "Reddit was made to send messages without anyone knowing who the sender was", then I would argue, OK, but why do you need an account then, that is displayed as a signature in all of your messages for the entire world to see?
It's somewhere between not knowing who the sender was and knowing exactly who the sender was. So is Bitcoin. And it's not necessarily easy to ensure your privacy is protected.

It has a hardware chip and information never leaves the device. In theory.
You know what kind of information can never leave the room from a mere science perspective? A paper wallet.
As I said, your questions are entirely pointless. You can't just run your Ledger. You need a pen and paper as well. There is no way around that. If someone steals your secret, it does not matter.
If I would be paranoid about malicious code, it would be because they have the altcoin communities submit code to be downloaded onto the ledger as apps.
It requires some amount of trust to use a Ledger - to the company that sells them. We have to trust that they thought all those angles through.
But in the end, there are smart people that will tell you here that a Ledger is almost as safe as a paper wallet. That's good enough.
If I were betting on this, I'd bet that a Ledger is safer for *you* than a paper wallet. As the device tells you what to write down and you don't need to be responsible for that yourself.
So use the Ledger, but no. Nothing is impossible.

But you don't have to be a cook to know that this dispute is doing neither side a favor. If convinced that naming it "BitCash" would be better for them in the long run... then would be doing a favor.
BitCash does not even sound bad... But it's like they are not interested in developing their own identity. I would get it if they really didn't have a selling argument. But at least short-term or mid-term, there is a point to use a currency with currently lower transaction fees.

That's one of the issues about investing. If you cash out, it might just be smarter (for many reasons) to spread it out a lot.
People imagine the person refreshing the graphs and just waiting the person to push a big red button and then all of a sudden have 5 millions or 10 millions.
It might be smarter to pay it out over the course of a few months, without panic involved. This mitigates a lot of effects / issues.

You can make some ballpark estimates. You can compare the blockchain to the current cost of logistics and storage of gold if you see Bitcoin as a replacement storage of value.
You can't find a perfect number. But of course a BitCoin won't be worth 1 billion dollars. It could, but that would mean a shit ton of BitCoins were destroyed or dollars have turned entirely worthless.
Finding a lower limit is the tough one. With gold you can at least find one (that being said, that argument is moot. There is a lot more gold stored than there is demand for it short term or mid term. If people lost trust in gold, the market would be flooded and it would essentially be worth only compensation of logistics and people would make less profit selling it).
The lower limit of Bitcoins could be practically zero. I don't think it is, though. I know a lot of people would consider just gambling on it if it dropped to $1000 or $100 or $1 unless there is "the new thing". Even the super rich with like 10k BTC would not sell them for 10 cents each no matter what.

It's not non-sense. At least you are not giving concise reasons as to why it should be.
The increase in block size from the past depends on a lot of things. It depends on transaction fees, the value of bitcoin, market volume. It depends on the current mempool.
And that's not linear. The increase was far steeper around 2015. It was way less steep around 2016-2017 (as there was not much room left to go up) and it was less steep around 2012-2014.
This is a *capped* exponential incline. It's a bit like metrics such as "people that own a mobile phone" evolve, as that's an exponential incline but there are only so many people that could own a phone today.
You cannot draw parallels right now.
We have a huge mempool. At least for now, the increase in blocksize would be *practically vertical*.
Then, after skyrocketing (to probably 2 megs), it might even go down a bit again.
If you "zoom out", your linear incline is basically a heavyside step function. It's essentially horizontal before the incline, horizontal after and vertical during.
**Edit** If you want to play around with numbers, use a logistic growth. f(x) = 1MB [ 1 + e^-*k*(year-2015) ]
* *k* is a function of mempool and how much demand there is for transactions. It's the steepness of the curve.
* year is the year we are in.
The heavy-side case I was describing is as *k* approaches infinity.
**TL/DR** You couldn't be more wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:01:12
Months? *Nobody knows this for sure*, why do you even make a prognosis like that?
How people behave after the lowered fees we can only speculate. Let's assume doubling the block size leads to **a tenth** of the fees (I don't see why, but let's err on your side of things. Even this part is not trivial to figure out. The *distribution* of transaction fees in the mem chain matters and its change does).
So, what if the market then decides "Bitcoin solved its biggest issue". CNBC goes all crazy. And we go to $50k in another month.
And then people are like "Yay, finally $1 fees". People adapt. They start buying coffee. And all of the sudden, it took only a month and the fees are even *higher* than right now.
Or, *way way way* simpler: Fees drop to half the value. And **everyone and their mothers** are suddenly moving all their BTC. Consolidating them in single wallets. Because right now a lot of people are simply not moving their coins because they hope one day the fees will get lowered... which might start an explosive chain reaction the second fees bear down.
If you think you *know* how the fees will adapt to changes. Think again...
Have some faith in our bitcoin core collaborators. They know the right approach.

I don't believe in Bitcoin Cash's approach at all or any way whatsoever. But mark my words... I am talking about "approach". They *do* have a temporary advantage. They should be selling that.
If they did that, I'd be betting on BCH.
But with the way Roger Ver is approaching things and deceiving newbies and neutrals... It's hard to judge for a newbie like me how much influence he has.
Right now my heart lies with Bitcoin. But I wouldn't be at all surprised if the market is too impatient. I mean, I do systems operations for a living. It's always the same thing vs. management. God, I hate it. They don't give a fuck about security, best practices or anything as long as the demanded features are in it yesterday.
My heart tells me, that's what is happening here. But it's too much information to process in such a short time. That's why I'm not making any bets. I'm leaving shit as is.
I don't care ultimately about blocksize. I do care about consensus. The movers of Bitcoin Cash seem to knowingly force down this divide. But I cannot judge if they exhausted every single avenue before.
Well, one thing is it's exciting. And even the most conservative investers say to chill the fuck out when your gut screams at your body to panic.
It's a bit of comfort being able to look at the sum of BTC + BCH.
But to answer your question, there is no way both stick around 2 years down the line. Just no way.
But there is also basically no way BTC dies unless the devs threw the towel (which they won't) or Lightning would end up in utter desaster.
So I'm sure we can chill. Even if there would be a "flippening", that means squat. People are bad with numbers.
**Edit** And adding to that... No segwit just does not seem to make any sense to me. Maybe someone can explain it to me? Why don't they have it? Even if (and I don't think there is a way short-term or mid-term) BCH would dominate... it's only a matter of time until there would be Bitcoin Cash Cash. People have to see that...
And another point: What does Bitcoin Cash have to offer that Litecoin does not? You can't help but love the face of Litecoin.

I agree. I used it for legal purchases in the WWW. For usenet and donations mainly.
I used it as a currency. I don't understand early adopters. Respect. It seemed so dumb back then to *invest*. I mean I did end up investing implicitly.
But shit got up here because down there it was used for transactions. Server hosting, usenet, donations in my case. A loaf of self-replenishing bread.
You guys should have *spent* Bitcoin in the past when fees were negligible half a year ago. "But it's inflationary!" -- who cares? Just dollar cost average the amount you spend a month back to it. You can increase how much you charge your wallet up. It's no argument that it's better to hold onto it. A lot of people here just were not able to subtract.

Commerzbank is the only one that even offers an option for a free checkings account. But that one is their "special advantage offer", which is also an online account.
So if you go to them in person, they'll just direct you to the web page.
In Germany, we also pay fees for domestic wires... *unless* (you guessed it), we do them automatic (terminal etc.).
If we do them in person, they cost like 2 bucks per transfer.
That being said, students pay nothing. People with no work pay nothing. It's like 20€ per year.
Online accounts actually offer *you* money. A one time gift for opening an account with them.

I think Roger Ver should be really consider to improve on his PR... I'm a noob here. There are ways to say what he is trying to say without provoking everyone around him (even those that don't have a dog in this fight). It's just a no-brainer to have better PR unless he wants to damage both things.

It's the polar opposite of unreliable. The page is rock solid and never lags or is down, even if everything else is on fire. Even verification only takes 1-2 days.
Can't vouch for withdrawals. Only moved into cold storage with one thing. They have absolute fees, so you don't want to move paper money away.
Oh, now I remember what you heard. Iota has a problem with "delayed" withdrawals. They have a huge quantity of cryptos, at basically all times one of them seems to be broken for withdrawals and another is delayed.
I'm sure it has to do with Iota's network hick-ups and/or the new wallet. But yeah. I would not really bet on the Iota withdrawal. I personally trust them with my 15% or so of Iota... I wouldn't long-term, but I can wait until the [ledger supports iota](

That's a fallacy. You are thinking about it as a game and that you lost, if you end up having to buy for more.
In reality, it's a game of averages. What's so bad about losing 10%? We are up thousands since we started.
Caling tops and bottoms at this scale is certainly not stupid. You can sell now for 16k. If tomorrow it ends up at 18k, sure, you lost some. Don't have regrets, you might have made the right call. Buy again at some loss. You sold because of the chance of it dipping by 20% or even down to something like 10k.
You are betting no matter what and you can lose out no matter what. If it was roulette, I wouldn't bet on a dip right now. But the result is not betting on red or black it's betting on the 00. We have a whole lot more to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:57:07
I was not the person that started this argument, it was between you and another redditor.


Scalability would make an argument about the capability to *keep* increasing the capacity over time relative to demand.
Just because I have shown to increase my network capacity in a 256 address network over the past time, does not mean I will be able to do so once I approach that 256.
The question of scalability is trying to answer that question / solve this problem. It's to get rid off bottlenecks. Scalability is *why* we even bother trying to choose the correct address pool size.
Here is the important part:
In this case, if I can rule out demand could exceed 256 addresses, **only then** do I have a system "that scales". Just doubling that address pool does not mean "it scales". It just means that I can now fit 512 addresses.
Maybe the country I live in has only 350 people, or the company's business plan is set on a strategy that will make this impossible. In case of only ever being a potential for 350 people, you increasing address pool size by a factor of two have solved the scalability problem.
We don't just choose 256x256 addresses (a class b network), because that can potentially come with other issues.
That's why there is another layer on top of communication within a subnet. It's routing between subnets.
You can draw direct comparisons from "number of ip addresses" to BitCoin's scalability problems (but I'm not an expert on Bitcoin).
Can you maye see how in this example, there is no "but it scales 50% / 70% / 90%" etc.

I mean, I just bought a hardware wallet. I'm just comparing apps for the ledger, personally.
But let's be sure even the noobs (like me) know what they are doing. A reason to really rush this could be that for a few months, the problem could get even worse.

I get that this is committing suicide... but oh well: I'm just saying. As soon as you write "Bcash" in an 'article' like that, I know that you have an agenda and stop reading your article. If it's not propaganda, it will end up on and CoinDesk as well. You can call it 'BCH' and remain non-provocative. But oh well.
If you can't even try to keep the smallest semblance of neutrality when reporting news or leaving a commentary on your external site, then why should I keep reading?
Go ahead, downvote me. Ban me. Censor me. The mods have not been responding to modmail for quite some time here. If you want this comment gone, report it three times... This place is probably just too big at one point.
But you have an agenda, and you aren't doing yourself a favor by wearing it like a badge. If this is game theory, you are weakening your hand. You are just preaching to an echo chamber.
Before you get *too* riled up, I have not moved anything for almost a year. That means I have a far higher stake in Bitcoin but I currently hold equal amounts of BTC and BCH.
**Edit**  No mention of 'bcash'. I will be reading that article instead.

Bitstamp, but good luck getting in.
Other than that there is shapeshift. Not having SegWit is excusable for another 4-5 months depending on Lightning release.
**Not having Bitcoin batching is in-excusable**
* Binance (no bank link)
* Bitstamp (slow)
* Bittrex (careful)
* Kraken (overloaded)
* Poloniex
My recommendation is Binance. Buy a tiny amount of BNB if you choose that, so you save 50% on all trading fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:12:48
True. I do, too.
But the Bitcoin Cash crowd has some blame on that, as well. They have a distinct product. They should have tried to create their own brand identity.
Their approach gave them a head start - especially the last days. But if they really reach enough relevance, they will be at a weaker spot than with their own brand.
That's on them.
Ethereum is a name of its own. I take it seriously. Antonoupolos is also writing a book on Ethereum now, to me it's as legitimate as the name itcoin.
"Bitcoin Cash" is only temporary. Only one will survive long-term. You see BTC+BCH staying rather steady. It's mainly bleeding over.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:56:38
Remove bitcoin, and "altcoin" has the fee problems right now. Altcoin is the LN you have right now.
If you don't see how one main currency that defines value is currently *required* (and that's exactly what Bitcoin is, if you compare Alt/BTC graphs) then you should do some more research.
I'm just hoping the big market does not have to learn this lesson the hard way.

Bubble just means that the asset / asset class is speculative. It means the market decides the value. It means there is no price tag. It means there is no lower limit or upper limit on what the value could be.

You don't even need to verify. I don't believe they take money, they are crypto only.
If you go there, make sure you buy a minimal amount of `BNB` to cover your fees. Some currencies cannot be bought/sold in fractionals. If you have BNB that is not an issue.
It seems to be the best place to dump BCH as well. Coinbase does not even support BCH trading unless you are from the USA.
They have a shit-ton of markets, too.

Also, it's almost impossible to hedge against a Bitcoin bear phase, though. So be warned. Basically everything was on free fall tonight.

He was making arguments about "household computers", he was assuming we have about similar computing power and that, thus, we have a democratic voting effect from CPU power.

Yes you will be fine. Actually that's how you learn trading. Fees are usually percent based (or zero) unless you maybe withdraw.
But that saying "Don't keep your funds at the exchange" does not go if we are talking about your paper money. It's just for play.
The issue with that approach is: Chances are high you are not cut out for it. But it (probably) beats playing Online Roulette.
Don't let people tell you shit about fees. You don't pay network fees (which are static) just make sure the withdrawal fee is 0 or percent based.

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:11:34
It helps if you try to understand the technology a bit more. You would see that there are many, very good reasons for fees. Others can prove to you why "a" fee is necessary in a currency that has the concept of mining (it really is, it's not even hard to understand).
Now one could argue that that fee could be negligible. And you are right, it can be. And one could argue that the concept of mining is not necessary. You are right, we can require users to run full nodes and to the PoW themselves. Or we could go for a system with PoS (that has different issues).
If you don't try to learn these things, you are basically gambling. If you want to gamble on the possibility that "the majority could just move to some alt and never look back", hey... gambling is fun :) I think the odds are basically on your side at least short-term and probably mid-term on almost any decision you could make.
But I personally prefer trying to understand this on the deepest level possible/beneficial.

I think the smarter approach is to be a bit more patient and avoid their fees. And in the end, since my user account seems to be in a corrupted state at GDAX, I have no faith that withdrawals would go through without a lot of work with customer support.

No, it really wouldn't. The blockchain grows at 50 GB per year. That would take it to 100 GB per year.
What hurts centralization is increasing the 50 GB per year by an entire order of magnitude like Bitcoin Cash does. Maybe not now, but irreversibly in 2-3 years...
What kills centralization is increasing the 50 GB per year by 2-3 (or 6) orders of magnitude, like Bitcoin Cash is planning. Bitcoin Cash is not necessarily sustainable for more than a decade.
Your comment will look pretty insane in retrospect, when lightning will be deployed and it will be made clear that a blocksize of 1 MB is not enough *to even deploy lightning*...
From a systems perspective, not increasing blocksize right now is so entries in their ledger earn their right to get into the scarce space. We don't want to fill the book with meaningless information.
Once Lightning is being deployed, that blocksize needs to be increased appropriately.
The main issue is we cannot just fork it 3 times until it's perfect. The problem is that if we go to 2MB now, we might have to go to 4MB (or more) in order to be able to just deploy lightning.
Say Lightning is on. Say we have 1 million users. That's like 3 days to have everyone move their funds into a channel. With an empty mempool. And we have way way more than 1 million users.
In the end, lightning adoption will roll out rather slowly.

I don't know anything about this debate. But I am a systems engineer. The only reason that I could see (remember: I know nothing about this) is that engineers do not want to solve the same problem twice.
Does increasing the block size by a factor of 2 or 10 solve this even if Bitcoin went to the moon? It seems to be a pro/con kind of deal.
If you think *now* is a critical time, I want to remind you that there could be way more critical times ahead. There is some breathing room now.
Don't panic. Or do. It's not necessarily bad if the BTC price goes down to ~ $10k.

All that being said, maybe "it scales" "scaling" and "scalability" are terms that have different meanings in this one special community here (the bitcoin community).
But those would not be "layman" terms. It's perfectly fine if we use words differently among us. But I mostly just skipped the blocksize debates.
Systems engineers *want to* try to completely fix an issue and not just apply a bandaid. What's the problem if we get half the fees or a tenth of the fees, if the *value* of the fees increases by the same order of magnitude (or by a factor of one hundred).

No device is immune to attacks.

That means if you have a Ledger, you actually have a paper wallet *and* a Ledger on top of it.

You can apply it to everything, it's a very simple concept.
The entire point of this way to describe the phenomenon is that new capacity actually drives new services (or the traffic could not get worse in this example).
In reality it is a superposition of both. But the issue does not come from the services that need it. (We would all like some lower transaction fees so we could have more freedom to move our funds).
The issue comes with the fact that I am way more willing to move money, if it costs a fraction of today's 8-25 bucks.
It's just saying basically that giving a drug addict twice the amount of money is not really a solution. He'd just consume more drugs. The world is just not always as simple and black and white. But that's a good way to illustrate this phenomenon.

This particular argument does not apply. This *is* a scam.

Right now it is competing with other currencies based on emotions, though. Based on trust. I'd say to very vast extents based on hope.
Based on its *potential* merits.
Actual fraud would require malcontent from an individual or a group of individuals that are conspiring together. Calling Bitcoin a fraud is like accusing "poker" of cheating. A player is cheating, the game isn't. Even if the dealers in casino take a fee, that does not make it cheating.

First mover advantage is a perfectly valid reasoning, or I would be creating Facebook today.
That's the thing, if you want to have Bitcoin 2.0, it needs to offer a substantial improvement over it. No crypto currency was capable of convincing the masses yet, but if they do it would take a long time.
First mover advantage is perfectly valid reasoning. Bitcoin *does* have value now. First mover advantage means that we won't just have another carbon copy of it and have it gain the same amount of value. This is just impossible.
I'm sure you'd say gold has some intrinsic value (by the way it used to be valuable for centuries before an intrinsic value had been even found). Rarity *is* intrinsic value. Especially if it is mathematically guaranteed. If people lost their "trust" in gold due to its rarity (90% is just lying around, contributing to gravity), and "everyone decided to cash out", then the market would be flooded and you could only sell gold at the price of its logistics (essentially you'd be trashing it).
Maybe you'd have to pay someone to take your gold.
That will not happen, though. Gold coins go back millennia.

@_date: 2017-12-18 16:22:27
Why not all?
The Ethereum community has been a bit hostile as of late towards the Bitcoin community. I feel that is a result of impatience. As clearly their incline is quicker, if they adopt the Bitcoin adopters quickly. My motivation for this is that their responsible figures know that other coins have not solved scalability issues and they are not doing a good enough job of communicating that. While there can be reasons to increase the blocksize now... it's really not something that solves all our problems.
That being said, what they have is great, too. And it can work right next to Bitcoin. One is money, the other is fuel.
Litecoin is pretty dope. Bitcoin and Litecoin are basically friends. I currently hodl Bitcoin and use Litecoin for actual payments.

Bitcoins can be used as milli bitcoins (10^(-3)), micro bitcoins (10^(-6)) and one - the satoshi - gets its own name because it's the smallest unit that exists.
1 BTC = 1 000 mBTC = 1 000 000 µBTC = 100 000 000 satoshi

That is where I disagree. I am not getting confused with "Ethereum" and "Ethereum Classic".
If - say - Coinbase wants to make sure users do not get confused, they will make sure. If they don't, they should be called out on it.
I would recommend adding banner type notices in apps that warn you not to confuse them. Especially, when sending BCH or BTC.
Sadly, we do not own the name Bitcoin. And as long as you know what I am talking about and nobody gets offended, that is fine.
But hey, if you want to call it bcash, I have no authority over you. But you don't have authority over All that being said, why not just call it BCH? Like I have been doing here?

Without really having followed the debate, but just by looking at Bitcoin's market cap vs. altcoins and by the way my CEO does not understand when I explain to him that "increasing capacity" does not really solve the problem long-term, I feel I could hear a *click* behind.
The speed at which features are coming *has absolutely nothing to do with scalability*. You are really, really misunderstanding this. Scalability can only very indirectly affect that.
Scalability is the ability of a system to function under projected parameters.
It's as if you think the Bitcoin core devs are the system? They aren't. The blockchain and the people writing into it. *They* are the system. Bitcoin scales if we can be sure that even if Bitcoin went to the moon, the network holds up. Right now, it doesn't really. The scalability problem manifests in the huge fees.
Sorry, but you have no clue how the word should be used. It certainly has nothing to do with "soon TM", or the speed of LN. It's *why* we need LN, as it is a better attempt to solve scalability issues.
Please, please stop this discussion now and just read up on it.
An altcoin might be "more scalable", but that does not mean that "it scales (with the needs of the system)".
In computer science terms or mathematics, doubling the address pool does not increase scalability ( *O(n)* is the same set as *O(n/2)* ).
If you google "scalability" you will find exclusively computer or business pages. It's not a "layman's term".

according to Antonopoulos no.
 (7 months old, it's one I remember where he brings up the point).
The other currencies don't have scalability issues, because they don't have scale. I don't know if it's exact, but increasing the block size by a factor of 100 will only give you 100 x as many transactions per second on average. But the blockchain would grow 100 times as much per day. In three days, we would have a year's blockchain increase.

I'm in the same boat. And guess what. We are the absolute majority. We are who used Bitcoin as a currency. You just don't hear from us so much.
Yes, we only have 0.2 or 0.05 Bitcoins. But *everyone* wishes they invested more in their time. Even Roger Ver.
Many are now all-in that would really like to pay 20% out to improve their lives now. But they have a FOMO again.
Look at Antonoupolos for crying out loud. I have the respect to the early HODLers. But let's not kid ourselves, your life wasn't as rough as mine. Please see that there are people that got in for the utility. And people like me joined when the price was just slowly falling over very long term.
The 100 or 200 bucks I could deposit back then... They were a lot of money. It meant eating less of what I enjoyed. It meant no getting stoned for me, no drinks outside. It took extra faith during dangerous sickness. Now... if the 0 I ended up investing do pay my student debts I'll call it a win.

Ooooh, so my initial understanding of "the gold standard" was not *that far off*. I thought it was in the golden twenties when everyone "had so much gold". Little did I know that people owning dollars (or other currencies as this was not only a US problem) *literally had the equivalent of gold*.
I believe why deriving value from gold was bad is that people held on to their gold? That economy slowed down? A bit like we have with Bitcoin?
I am not an opponent of Bitcoin. Quite the contrary. But I believe this was a *pros and cons* kind of thing.
Little did I know *why* people derived value from gold. It was (as you now explained to me) literally by gold dictating how much dollars there is.

They share a lot of characteristics. It actually is a ponzi scheme, but for practical purposes it's what happens with an "infinite" supply of people that buy.
Our brain cannot think in very large numbers / infinities.
They could argue that people who would buy more bitcoin run out. That's what happened with tulips after all. It's not impossible, either (regardless of what people here might tell you). But the reason why nobody kept investing into tulips was *that they just became too expensive*. And you can't just cut them in ten.
Where we land is Satoshi's explanations about this being a "self-fulfilling prohecy" or a "positive feedback loop". It can be.

Ok, so you are now at 200%. I'm assuming.
Why not use 10% or 50% to re-buy, even if it goes up to 16k + 1.6k?
Call it a loss, avoid the disappointing feeling.
I'd personally (if you really sold everything and not just 150% or so) wait for the next dip (even if the dip is small). If it drops another 20%, just buy. Just nobody knows if the next dip is at 16k or 20k or whatever number.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:51:50
Don't be too concerned.
Systems engineers need to do a good job. Increasing blocksize right now, when it doesn't do all too much, is not a good call as it is a one-way street. It adds to how much the blockchain grows *per day*.
And space *does* matter. The only two resources here are CPU power and how much space is lost forever!
So the way a systems engineer would approach this is to first increase the efficiency of how much goodness you get out per MB of blocksize. And *then* increase our "firing rate".
At that point, an increase in blocksize would be a definite consideration. Maybe even a more drastic one.
But this is one of the things that needs to be done right.
People are not that good in estimating the effects for the future. Removing some velocity from the moon train is not too stupid right now. Hopefully it will find a bit of a stable point now. That would signify that the market gives Bitcoin some time to find its best way.
Now imagine we double the blocksize. Fees go down to 1 buck. The mempool gets away. But in the next 1-2 weeks, people adapt to the lower fees. Add to that, the price might double because people thought "oh, nice they finally solved it". So we *fill the new lane* and end up back at $8+ transaction costs. I even made up 1-2 weeks, who knows if this could take only 1-2 days.
Now they adapted, and we are back at square one. Nothing changed *but* we have the drawback. The bad side of this.
Have some patience. Don't be too concerned. You should be, if we doubled blocksize twice already and learned the hard way that that solves absolutely nothing.
We are not ready yet for the moon. Give us some time.
Most importantly, trust our dear systems engineers at Bitcoin Core. They really know this shit. And the devs are our most valuable asset.

I'm just a noob. I am still waiting on exchanges.
I am just sympathetic towards LTC as they are very Bitcoin-friendly. I'd be very surprised if Bitcoin, Ethereum and Lite-Coin did not all go up at least for the next year or so.
I'd say the highest risk is in LTC. Followed by ether.
That being said, I believe right now, Litecoin and Ethereum are undervalued (quite heavily) but Bitcoin is *slightly* overvalued. To which we currently seem to see a small and so far healthy correction. Volatility is intriguing.
I hold 0 LTC and 0 ether. Bitcoin is where I see the least amount of red flags... I wouldn't mind if we bounced back to $8k or below. It's a proven technology. 8 years. Fuck, in enterprise we need stuff that's proven over long periods of time. And not the cutting edge stuff. People are just impatient. The game is played long-term, mid-term and long-term. Each are different games.

Better *how*?
* They both don't have Segwit
* They both don't batch transactions
* They both are **shit**
* They both should be named and shamed inside our own community.
Not "true story". Maybe the twins should use some of their wealth and PR to lead with a good example instead of this shit-show has been displaying lately.
Stop upvoting everything that *seems* to fit the narrative, Jesus. Use Bitstamp and Binance. That being said, Binance also does not have segwit. But FFS batching is what an exchange really needs.
Stop using shit exchanges because you are impatient or lazy you fucks.
Here are some alternatives
Exchange|Problem with it
Bittrex|Read up on the FUD
Bitstamp|Verification &gt; 1 month
Kraken|Overloaded. [Don't use](
Binance|Crypto only. There is Poloniex as well
If there is no good options and you need it right now... the strain on the network comes from *withdrawing* BTC from Coinbase/GDAX.

Decentralized means that nothing stops you from becoming a miner now and that enough use that approach. Centralization happens because of (sometimes hostile) pools of miners collaborating in a cut-throat way.
Miners are not just some group of conspiring, hive minded people like we are here on Reddit. They will not just collectively refuse to do something as if they were one person.
If they receive less fees, then they will mine other crypto currencies. We need a good amount of miners, because it makes Bitcoin resilient against attacks.

One revolution at a time, brother. Academia and science give us self-driving cars right now. It's the MITs and Universitäten around. It's people not profiting of it who write the code at first.
Also I don't like the bash on proprietary. Who says they won't publish the code? There is really no way around writing good code here. But maybe not everyone should be legally allowed to own and modify that code, until a free version is engineered. What better way is there to prove that, than to have the world audit every part.
It will be a bit like Google Chrome... it will be mostly published code. Because of the importance of driving (the web browser is as important, as far as programs can go today). But some parts they cannot/will not publish.
Which is fine. But self-driving cars are a new thing. It will take a decade until we get our Chromium.

I will try to explain this fallacy to you (also jesus, you are Panko from PoE are you not)?
If you sell BTC now because you are afraid of losing X *and* Y, you could easily be losing out on *Z*. That's why there is so much hype right now. People lost *Z*. Numerous times. Now they are scared of losing out.
There is no right answer. You are betting/gambling no matter what if you are in your position. If people are nervous about timing, I recommend paying yourself out a very small percentage of the portfolio every month. Like a wage.
With the rise of BTC value you probably want to re-balance your portfolio if you think like that. Back then you probably allotted 5% or 10% to BTC (or a similar account). If now (due to the rise of BTC) 90% of your portfolio is BTC, you might want to do some re-adjustments.

Ok, you have two links explaining things to you. Let me try one third approach:
It's not like the other side is doing anything different. They say that Bitcoin is not even called Bitcoin. They say it is called "Bitcoin Core". They are trying to undermine the meaning of being "the Bitcoin".
It's like saying "You are not even Bitcoin".
But they don't get to choose, how the BTC community calls their currency (it's Bitcoin).
Now, calling them Bcash is almost exactly the same thing. They want to be called "Bitcoin Cash" (or even "Bitcoin"). But "we" are trying to undermine the meaning of their currency.
When you call it "bcash" you are taking a flag. It's like you are saying "it's not even the real thing, lol".
It's a fine opinion to have. But I will judge you for it. 9/10 times I will be right.

There is no such concept as scaling "99%". You are entirely misunderstanding the concept of scaling.

A system either functions or it does not function. There is no system that functions 99%, of the time, because it would be 0% functional in that case.

I am not so sure if the GUI is important, when OP is making a point about a "reference implementation". Crypto currency developers will find more usage in the command line and application interfaces.
I would assume most people, that do use Bitcoin core as a wallet (which is huge and cumbersome) and not just as a full node or miner are using the CLI.
I don't see many people use the Bitcoin Core GUI *as their wallet*. Maybe I am wrong, though. I feel that there are many wallets that probably offer a better UX.
I'm not saying I am right. I am just saying you are not necessarily right either.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:33:37
I'm not sure how the word would be properly used here. But in IT, I would use "this infrastructure/system scales" or "this infrastructure/system does not scale" by trying to estimate likely growth scenarios and best case growth scenarios.
I then see if the infrastructure/system can handle the likely scenario, and if it can be adapted to handle the best case scenario of immense growth.
In this context, it would only scale if the increase in efficiency was enough to make it so our prognosis of best case adoption strapped onto that coin would mean things work out.
When someone says it does not scale, they probably mean that it's an improvement over things but not enough of an improvement to have this problem solved and gone away.
Like take a pool of IP addresses. Most networks have a limit of 256 addresses including the network's address and the broadcast address.
When I say "that scales", I am not saying it's not an adequate wording to distinguish that network from a `/25` network with 128 IP addresses available.
If I say "that scales" I look at the current office place and try to find physical constraints as to how many ip addresses we might need. I will need to estimate how many virtual IPs we could have and how many we will probably have.
Also I need to ensure there is enough buffer.
So my `/23` network can handle four times as many addresses as that `/25` network. But that does not mean that "it scales" (with the needs of the business or the operation).

Hmm? It went down from exactly 20k to exactly 18k (it bounced between those two walls). 10% is a pretty nice dip. I would not have hesitated one bit if I was verified at an exchange. Dips like that are basically free money unless you have maxed out your potential investments (which you never should for this reason).
You just needed liquidity and needed to be there at that time. There was a huge buy wall at $18k on my exchange and everyone participating in it just knew it would bounce back to where we are no (at least) immediately.

It's a so called speculative market. There is nothing that "ties" the price. When something goes from 0 to a really large number, that's a by-product.

No, we wouldn't be. I don't know if you are intentionally using hyperbole. But it's potentially OK if you trust your backup provider, mobile phone provider or storage provider (or... *bank*) to store an encrypted version of your passkeys for you (like for instance breadwallet and iCloud do today). They are pretty good at that. It's their expertise. What they can't guarantee, they can insure.
You say we would be "right back where we started", but that is wrong. We wouldn't be. Right now, you *have* to use a bank. You cannot have a wage without a bank.
What's valuable is not the moronic idea that everyone will somehow become an expert in OpSec and do perfect best practices to store their most valuable information.
What's valuable is that people no longer have to depend on any outside party or institution. What's valuable is that you can DIY your own bank. Just because you can DIY things today doesn't mean everyone should.

Don't be so greedy. Let's assume Bitcoin goes up to 10 million $USD in 2020.
What does 0 volatility mean? It means *Bitcoin cannot fail*. It means that we get a perfect geometric incline and have a steady growth. It would be a guaranteed success.

* An EC card / TAN list is a form of two-factor authentication that belongs to the 90s. Heck, I would not be surprised if people could just print EC cards out by knowing my account number and PIN
There is no excuse at least to some of the reasons. Most my Content Management Systems I create and even things I host on my Dropbox try harder than this.

I disagree. They are both redundant ledgers that store information. Of course, Reddit is centralized and Bitcoin is not. Of course, Reddit is "inflationary" (everyone can create comments out of thin air). That's why it can't have/store value.
For everything else (especially the topic of privacy), you can draw 1:1 parallels. Even down to law enforcement, IP addresses and how exactly someone could get doxxed.
It's only a best practice that we create new addresses (reddit accounts) for transactions. Some treat reddit the same way.
The only difference I see is that you can avoid your address leaking entirely with Bitcoin on a non-ISP level.

Ok, let's take a step back.
They *did* just disagree with you. Eloquently, too. And it added to the discussion (I had Bitcoin back then, but I don't even know what exchange they are talking about).
**Then you attacked the straw man**. They never claimed there are no other issues with Bitcoin, that a crash could not happen again. They just said we could not draw 1:1 parallels to that particular crash from 2013.
**Then you went ad hominem**. I would be way more upset than OP. Not because of your businessinsider link. But because of your manipulative and fallacious way of engaging in arguments.
All that being said, OP really added to the discussion, while you didn't. Everything would be 100% different if you chose non-provocative words than "Oh, well then I guess ...", which is one of the most passive-aggressive, cynical ways to engage in argument. You could have said "While you are indeed correct, let us not forget that we face a lot of other very big issues with cryptocurrencies".
You didn't. You are just here to rile up people or to make yourself feel better by hoping to bait others into particular responses and then *winning* the argument. GTFO

What? It is absolutely normal to have multiple domain names on one IP address and not just "some TLS extension".
You will not reach the respective sites by typing in the ip address. Instead your web browser always sends the actual URL to the web server and that in return can distinguish between domain1.tld and domain2.tld and reverse proxy those to the actual web servers.
This load balancing is very trivial and the absolute norm. Effectively it makes it so that a single IP address is shared between multiple domain names. Even like webapp1.domain1.tld and webapp2.domain1.tld etc.
Maybe we are talking on cross purposes.
The thing is, HTTPS is based on a domain name and with TLS you will send the domain name in an unencrypted fashion so your ISP has the potential to snoop those packages out.

You are not going to get a great and explained answer and least of all a consensus from a random reddit reply by a pseudonym like me. So treat it like gambling. It's like investing in anything else, you can look at the past bubbles and draw your conclusions.

There is only exactly one way to translate a term, phrase or sentence into German from English. Always.

It’s not yet much more valuable than it is now. We hope it will be. It’s a bit too volatile at this day to be the store of value that replaces everything. It’s not accepted by enough merchants to give people a reason to value it.
It’s certainly the best you have if you are fleeing the country. Does not matter if it loses half of the value in politically corrupt fiat then.
But for you and me it is not yet a great store of value. It’s driven by people hoping it would double its value over a period of weeks or months. Instead, we need it to grow by 1% to 10% per year.

It might easily crash.
Thing is, when it does, people will invest again like crazy because they will be afraid to miss out.
So for the end user: Are you holding for ~ a decade? Or are you holding for ~ months? If it is the latter, I'd try to get some good trades to get out for a few months.
When things normalize, rebuy. That way you lose at most 20-25% (which is nothing, relatively speaking. BTC is volatile, people made 500% this year. What is 475% compared to 500%).
Ask yourself, what would you do if BTC lost all their value over night. We are not playing HC Diablo, don't get in situations where you want to commit suicide. Even if we have seen these "crashes" dozens of time before.

Could be a catastrophic event that does not span multiple nations. Such as just the Dollar crashing or just a (which you admittedly granted) less important currency crashing.
I agree, if I was betting, I'd rather bet on a crypto currency to crash. But I could easily suggest that a scenario exists, where the dollar crashes but the bitcoin *rises* instead.
A bit like in Greece. When banks could no longer guarantee withdrawals. But it was local to Greece. So there was a bit of a BitCoin market going on. Of course, you could not buy eggs using BitCoins. But you could easily do most of the online stuff using bitcoins and potentially even trade.

That's how this started, I don't genuinely *see* it as anything. What I perceive it as would be irrelevant to say the least.
But I don't have money to invest. So for me, it only had its use as a currency.
Right now, the conflict is that those 50 bucks turned to a thousand bucks. And while we had the conversation it went from $5200 to $5800. It would be a good time to cash out honestly. But who the fuck knows it's volatile and speculative.
You'd normally argue that one should cash out and be happy. But it is probably a shittier feeling to see it hit $10k and having cashed out than to see it crash to $3000 and not having cashed out. That's why I probably won't.

So it has been like this magic loaf of bread that refills itself. It is a bit weird to think about the $50 payments I made 2 years ago, but that's just a fallacy. I would have payed that money regardless and it's just the money I did not choose to invest.
What I am trying to say, BTC is more useful if you hold it *and* do payments with it. At least a good online service will have better conversion rates. While Paypal is convenient I do not at all trust them. BTC is an all around improvement IMO.
TL/DR Why not both?

Old comment, sorry


Because we are in that situation *right now*, aren't we? What if that is it. $6k. So according to you, if it flatlined now (the insane upwards trend stopped), then the speculative investors would say "this is it" and cash out.
1. Then there are a lot of people just waiting for a situation like a month ago to invest heavily again. People are looking for a crash just to buy *right now*.
2. Who says everyone will then say "this is it"? Who would say everyone would cash out *now*?
The situation you are describing, we are in it. You are speculating about the future but assuming in that situation people would make a hindsight call. They can't.
You theory would need to hold *now*, if it flatlined. I don't see it doing that, to be honest.
In the end, what matters is if the whole movement keeps mobilizing new buyers. As long as humanity is not saturated with bitcoin adopters, there will be demand.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:43:38
That's a technicality and of course you are technically correct. (This seems to be important to you, judging by the bold letters and nobody is disputing the validity of your point)
But you will still stumble upon many and many people that only know the *fork* from the fork button on GitHub. And usually it's what people do to other people's projects.
Of course I could fork off my own, but so far I only used branching for those purposes and if I did a major new version I never had to re-factor so much old code that it was worth it to attempt and keep a history for the few snippets.
I get that in the context of BitCoin, this behavior must be tiring. But: I would expect the majority of people to hear *split* when I talk about a forked project. Especially among developers outside of That is why even the first paragraph of your link acknowledges this. Because gay can mean happy as much as it does, but when you use it in speech it still means gay.

And it could. It's not a clear and easy answer. Say the price drops, are we all drooling to buy more? Yes we are.
But who wins is the selling power vs. the buying power. If it gets overwhelmed, it would be the end of the game. There are enough scenarios that you could simulate, where this would happen. Just this requires enough of the right people to make drastic decisions.
BTC is not a pyramid scheme. You don't have to do something to get the money and what you have is already tangible (just because it is intangible for some does not mean it is). More tangible than paper money even, to be honest.
But it fits some of the criteria. There are always *way way* more people that have not made profits yet. If they did, then only on paper.
It could bust this spike, but if I was betting I would bet on it recovering. That's why I (and many others) would buy if it halved over the next days.
The challenge is: Buy at what threshold?
I am not buying if it keeps rising more than 3-4% per day.

My government has no reason to ban transparent crypto. I know mixers are illegal where I live as that is effectively money laundering. Banning a privacy coin is not that far off.

The point of my comment was not that the percentage is higher than what you make it out to be.
My point was to give *my experiences* and show people, that it is pretty cool to do some of the payments using bitcoins. I understand people consider this as "cashing out". And those $20 now might be $500 in 2 years.
But my point is that you can just cash in more than you would and use some as payments. It's OK to do. We don't have to completely freak out over the value all the time, when we do.
I agree the percentage is very low and my point was not to dispute that. My point was to get some others to try because it is a positive experience for me. Thinking "but that money would have turned to so much more value!" is a wrong way of approaching this (which I believe is the main reason not more people use it as a currency). If someone truly believes that, he could invest even more. But we all know that we should not invest more than we would be OK with losing.

I am saying if it does now or even go down. Which a lot are waiting for after such an unusual rise.
I understand what you were saying now, though. But I am not sure if it would ever just go to a crawl (which you seem to doubt as well). If anything, we'd see it crash and see how much people panic. I thought you were saying that everyone would cash out then.
But you were arguing that over months it gets more and more stable. I agree the effect you are describing would take place then, I just don't have faith that this situation will ever come. I think it will remain volatile or crash and *then* stabilize at a way lower flatline. But that is still a long way to go.

You obviously have no fucking clue how censorship is defined. I have no clue what XT is and do not care. You guys are just so ridiculous, you are being linked from other subreddits and people making fun of your posts and quoting people like you.

MalwareBytes has an AntiVirus?

That sounds weird. As there is a Chinese 4 AM, a European 4 AM and an NA 4 AM.
You **really** want to express your timezones in UTC. I mean, it is pretty obvious that you are from NA. So markets move when Europeans wake up but the last American goes to bed?

That would be the load balancer's job.

I haven't used Coinbase but I am a fully noob. I am using a very iOS centric wallet on an old iPhone solely for BitCoin. I charge it up using VirWox. Apparently breadwallet seems to handle making new addresses for me when necessary.

I can recommend using two browsers. Firefox with No-Script for sites you usually go to and where you log in etc. You only set your sites up once.
The other (I use Chromium) for anonymous surfing. It would actually cost me money not being able to go on arbitrary sites if the client needs something.
However, the services I regularly use (I don't use Facebook, but if I were to) - I would strictly want behind NoScript.

Old comment but in a scam *people have to lose money*. And normally that is the majority of participants, too.
There is a *guarantee* of that happening. And someone is betting on it. There is no such thing with bitcoin. Everything is speculative. The 'scammers' could easily be the ones that would lose the most.
The question is if this is a bubble.

It might, you never know. There could be even a world war, there is a non-zero probability things might escalate some time in our lives.
Even normal currencies can crash. Even the dollar. While I would not bet on it, I am also not too arrogant to admit that it is a real possibility, in particular with the current US gov etc.

When you said you had to threaten to literally rip out the wall, what *exactly* do you say in these moments? I am just being ignored if I try to express that things are inacceptable.

No. What OP said. Stagger the buy ins. Don’t be greedy.

Because cobra tried being reasonable and called out petty attacks against the fork. So he is now a shill.
To some extent it makes sense to be against cobra as forks like that are an attack on Bitcoin. But calling him a bcash shill is factually and provably wrong.
