Just putting questions marks after statements doesn’t constitute any kind of explanation. Your response is immature and lacks historical context.

Strawman. Not talking Lambo. Mustang GT 350’s sold a couple years back for $40k and are selling for $90k+ now
tons of other examples like that

some expensive cars go up in value

If you manage money for someone else, you need to insure that if you lose that money (stolen, burns in fire, etc.), they have recourse. Big funds need assets they’re managing insured. This one podcast I listen to had an episode about it:

yes, the whole system could be improved
like, say, parents educating their kids about finances
or say, making sure their kids understand basic math
all these things have nothing to do with military budget
american culture is about spend spend spend 
it’s consumer driven
nothing will change until that changes

You’re all over the place dude. We’re not talking about insurance for anyone, like Bob who can buy some Bitcoin through Coinbase. We’re talking about insurance for institutional custody. 
Here’s the law. If you manage $150mm in assets, you need a certified custodian. Custodianship requires insurance. That’s it. It’s a legal requirement.

i’m a software developer and run my own business
my rate is $250/hr for smart contract and crypto consulting work (c++, rust)
i’m booked through 2019
i own one rental property in portland, or and another in austin, tx. the income i see from these is enough so i don’t need to work.
i own a mustang gt 350r that has doubled in value since i got it
i just sold a 1980s porsche i picked up for $27k 15 years ago for $120k
i started mining crypto in 2012
but hey, enjoy investing in the stock market or whatever it is you do for weak returns 
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:31:11
what is shocking about that?
you have inflationary asset
that’s what happens
@_date: 2018-10-17 15:49:52
Then they are fools who don’t understand economics or finance or even math.
Adults learn these things and do something about it. Why would you expect your dollar to just be there for you in the future?
People need to learn basic math and compounding interest.
@_date: 2018-10-17 15:39:42
USD doesn’t safeguard anything, and no one makes the claim that it does. It’s inflationary and meant to be spent, not held.
What safeguards wealths?
Real assets 
You need to invest your USD in assets (real estate, stocks, etc.)
If you don’t, then you’re a fool thinking the USD will go up in value. It won’t.

Gimme a break. You clearly know nothing about cars. It’s not about lightning striking. This shit happens all the time.
Plenty of examples of cars that don’t depreciate much or appreciate in short time frames. Just don’t buy a lambo, it’s a piece of shit that guarantees high depreciation.

this is almost an hour and a half long - what does he say that’s relevant here?
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:46:41

enjoy your myopic little existence

All Coinbase has for them is first mover advantage and some nice UI/UX. Everything else Coinbase touches falls apart. Wouldn't trust them with anything remotely technical. Toshi is probably riddled with bugs.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:46:04
Makes sense. Just don’t want Coinbase pushing their shitty browser around!
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:00:08
love bitcoin here, but one click? more like a handful of engineers figuring out a safe way to do it and several months of coding behind it.
seriously get lost with your stupid embellishments.

I'm keto, I don't eat carbflakes. Also, can you decipher wtf they're saying and translate into plain English?

There are bulls in the stock market who will hold a stock forever - say it pays a dividend or does stock splits, for example. Bulls are long assets. That's it. Period. There is no "sort of."
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:11:50
What? How is it "sort of?" That's the precise definition of a HODLer - a bull, someone who is optimistic about an asset. There is no "sort of." 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:03:17
this is stupid. a HODLer is a Bull. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:14:54
What? Fix your spelling and write complete sentences. No idea what you are saying.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:24:04
Because this industry is full of idiots.
