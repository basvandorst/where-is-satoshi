can you explain that a little bit.  i think i get it, but it would be cool to hear it explained for science

so now are the crypto still considered decentralized if they are going through a traditional bank?  isnt this like the worst possible outcome?  exactly what we didnt want it to be?  or is it good and Im just an asshole towards banks?

i dont invest more than Im prepared to lose.  its a gamble at the end of the day.  neither of us know what will happen.  we can hark back to other times and places, but concurrency is something new.  we dont know what will happen.  I even lost about 50 bucks(now at least $4,000 back in the mt gox days, but I have invested a small amount now in ethereum and may put some in btc.  i do this because the potential payoff is worth the risk for me.  Also I'm really behind the concepts of crypto and hope it changes things in a net positive way.  It is REALLY hard to determine what will end as a net positive effect, but I am really demoralized by the state of the economy and I think this has the chance to change a few things.  Maybe I am naive, but I am not risking very much on this.  not even one full paycheck.

its a fork though.  I think bitcoin deserves a lot of credit, but Im not sure it should be at number one right now,  I think a lot of it is something bordering on mass hysteria.  i think there is gonna be a lot of unforeseen things happening as we all figure this stuff out and decide which coin(s) we want to adopt as a people.  im not really emotionally invested in any particular coin, but I would like a coin thats not able to be mined(for energy reasons) and has o transaction fees as well as privacy.  transaction speed is getting pretty fast so I think that will be a non issue with the newer coins pretty soon.  to me its kinda like(forgive this awful analogy) linuix.  the original linux was super awesome and very genius, but no one wants to use the original anymore.  they want the newest, up to date think that offers the best usability.   again, Im just poor boy, with a small amount of ethereum and litecoin, but i think this stuff is really interesting and could change things that I'm not even qualified to discuss. hopefully it will be for the better, but its not always easy to understand how the future will play out.

What wallet will hold iota,btc,Ltc, and eth?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:44:54
how will they know if you have any coinz or not.  how will they enforce this is what im asking
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:18:49
you cant blame an exchange because ur mad that it causes competition to a crypto that you're rooting for.  If bitcoin is gonna stay the longrun, then it will have to deal with this kinda stuff numerous times.  gdax is not here to help bitcoin specifically, its just a place to trade crypto.  was there insider trading?  probably, but isnt there?
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:00:36
i think we define economics differently.
