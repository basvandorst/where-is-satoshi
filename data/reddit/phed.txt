I think it's wrong and also bad for Bitcoin's reputation to say its value comes only from people believing in the value.
Gold and Bitcoin both have unique properties. And Bitcoin solves a real world problem. Before Bitcoin there was no way of trusting other parties in a decentralized network dealing with valuable assets (Byzantine's General Problem), which is solved by the combination of a public ledger (block chain), proof of work (mining), asymmetric encryption and other cryptological techniques.
What you're saying lead to tulip mania. Bitcoin is different from tulips.

Sure, that's what I said... 
Let me dumb it down and make super simple for you:
1) In general (unrelated to Bitcoin) trading and paying are two different things.
2) People who used Mt Gox to *acquire* Bitcoins, deposited money, made a buy order and withdrew their Bitcoins. They were never affected by the hack (financially).
3) If people misuse an exchange as a wallet and sent payments to merchants from Mt Gox, then they're doing it wrong - how can that be the fault of the Bitcoin protocol?

That's not a good comparison.
Let's  say paying with your credit card compares to paying with bitcoin. Nobody has access to your wallet and the hosted wallets have multisig.
Then there's Mt. Gox, an *exchange* to *trade* bitcoins, where at no point you should have stored any bitcoins except when day trading as a speculator, which has nothing to do with payment.
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:55:41






Instead of your *credit card* you could hand over your *business card*, running a Bitcoin consultancy to help merchants accept and people understand and use Bitcoin :) .

Those libraries don't rely on a Bitcoin framework. I've seen 3rd .NET libs for several exchanges (incl trading). They're sometimes linked on the exchanges API documentation websites. Or search on github directly. For quoting prices, bitcoincharts.com has a super simple API, it's public and returns JSON, you only have to parse that. But they ask you to only query every 15 minutes.

It gives more info away than you think. Foe example, it's probably not a random sequence of characters. An attacker would start a dictionary attack with only combinations of words, then with substitutions of characters (1337), then with dates here and there etc.

Are we talking you paid everyone and everything in bitcoins or did you simply use the gains from selling bitcoins for a higher price than when you bought them and then used those dollars?
Edit: Nevermind, you cashed out first. Skipped the part when reading the post for the first time.

Of course it depends on who you want to convince. In this example it was a restaurant, so let's talk about the average business. They don't care much about ideology or "improving the world". Instead, they probably even become wary of what you're trying to convince them of. They're the kind of people who take someone in a suit and tie more seriously. So what you can do here is act accordingly and make real business with them. Tell them about the benefits that directly affect their profit (quick, low fee, international transactions without charge back and freaking physical paper or coins) and then charge for your time and effort. Nothing wrong with that. By the way, I wasn't even serious with my initial reply. I guess you missed the smiley. That's okay.
Edit: Also, it was a suggestion for doing something instead of giving up ("hand CC") and not meant as a replacement for giving a merchant the initial bitcoin introduction when asking if you can use it as a payment method.

No mentioning of Apple Pay yet. My theory is that when Paypal announced it's (kind of) support of Bitcoin and Apple announced Pay, speculators expected the price to either stop falling and rise, or continue its downward trend. The latter happened, despite many good news. So for now there seems to be some kind of consent that currently the public interest in acquiring and using bitcoin is lower than the aforementioned speculators' interest to get out of the game (for now).
On the other hand you shouldn't overrate the impact of news, so maybe it's just the downward trend that hasn't been stopped for a while.

I just looked at the Python API. I never programmed in Python, but it looks as if the actual communication happens in netvend.py in send_command, which uses urllib2.urlopen to send a HTTP request.
If you could describe the HTTP interface in a structured way (what paths are available, what parameters are there, how does the body have to look (if there are POST requests with JSON at all - just had a short look)), it would probably help others build mini-libraries in other languages. As soon as there's a Java lib, people can start with Android apps. As soon as there's a JavaScript lib, people can start with web apps and hybrid cross platform apps. Etc.

Advanced trading orders. Stop loss for buying = buy when the price gets higher than x. On some platforms you can even set an automatic subsequent trade like "then sell if price gets lower than x" or even "let the price get higher, but as soon as it gets below 5 % of its peak after the buy, sell".

That sounds ok. But here in Germany that's not how it works. I guess we're a bit behind and I'm sure it's not just us. See? Good for you if it works for you, but what about everyone else? Bitcoin works internationally and is borderless. That was one of my points, wasn't it?
Now to your drawbacks: I'll let you the first one - the ways to acquire bitcoins need to be improved. But the second one: You're assuming you're carrying around all your bitcoins in an unsecured mobile wallet. You don't do that. You have the same amount of bitcoins in your mobile wallet that you have in your fiat wallet as cash. Christmas shopping or buying a car? Well, transfering a bit more for that occasion is done in a few clicks.

I just remembered there's Jython and IronPython, so maybe you could just turn your existing Python code into Java and .NET libraries by compiling your code with those compilers.

I skipped the BIP38 part at first and didn't consider that in my original reply. That sorts out the issue with the mailman. But still:
If the buyer gives you an address + encrypted private key (and you don't know the private key), the transaction of value takes place on the blockchain because you're sending bitcons to the buyer's public address and then sending the paper wallet just for the sake of having something to track. That's not much different from the buyer giving you his public address, you sending him bitcoins to that address digitally, and you sending him a hand written note reading "there you go", or well, maybe "hereby I confirm that I sent you x BTC to the address 1xxxxxxxxxxx that you mentioned".
In case the seller knows the private key and sends the wallet with the encrypted key (and told the buyer about the password via a secure channel), there's still the issue with the trust. With two people knowing about the private key, no one could prove she didn't sweep the coins herself.

NFC and Bitcoin are not competitors. Bitcoin works very well *with* NFC. You probably mean all current fiat NFC solutions combined but that's the problem: every mobile carrier, every credit card company and a dozen startups have their own NFC payment solution, all incompatible to the others, forcing consumers to have a bunch of accounts just so they can pay in the supermarket *and* at the gas station *and* at that restaurant, just because they have different solutions.

That's true and the indicator for that is how many companies are accepting bitcoin as payment and how many people actually use bitcoin as payment (and also storage - but not for profit).


This indeed does affect the value of bitcoin, but in another way. It's *speculation*.
Let's say the properties of bitcoin (quick, low fee, decentralized, ... transactions etc.) plus the **current adoption** make people value Bitcoin at $ 200. Then calculating the possibilities of **further adoption** and thus a higher value because of the limited amount of bitcoins (supply / demand) is **speculation** and drives the value to $ 600. This speculation is the reason of the volatility.
My point is, the current value is the sum of the actual value plus the value that comes from speculation. And when telling people about the value of bitcoin, then the speculation part might scare them away ("I don't want to gamble" / "I don't want to be the victim of speculators"), while **focusing on the real world application** might help them understand that bitcoin's value doesn't (only) come from belief.

I'd make 1 BTC the minimum amount to buy, so there'd be 3000 people at max, probably much less (1-2000) because of the opportunity to buy cheap coins.
But you're right, 1) when things go wrong, the organizing person is screwed (e.g. people saying they didn't receive their coins) and 2) 2 weeks is probably not enough to set all of this up in a failproof way.

You can buy PETA shares on Havelock. A share equals 1 GH/s and you get paid a daily dividend. You can sell your shares any time you want, so as long as the share price is stable (probably drops with difficulty increases) all daily dividends are pure profit. What do you think about that?

The optimisric outlook is that not the coinbase transactions are the interesting source of income to the miners, but the sheer amount of all those little tx fees that add up. Tx are easy to include in a block, so mining rigs don't need more power for that. That's just needed for the "artificial" difficulty that keeps the block rate at 1/10min.
Correct me if I'm wrong with anything please.

Could be people moving their stash from cold wallet to exchanges to jump ship.
Could also be people acquiring bitcoins on exchanges and moving to cold storage (assuming some "new" bitcoiners want to rake advantage of the price and just want to try out with small amounts and the counterpart are fewer early adopters with bigger stashes, this wouldn't be contradictory to the downward trend).
You can't say any of the two for sure, as long as we don't know what's behind the transactions.

Well, I wouldn't have said anything if one of the following would be the case:
- Either you try to profit from something bad that happened on platform A and you want to convince users that your clone B is better. Then you should be prepared to handle the load of users that you always wanted to have on your platform. Prepare with money and resources.
- Or otherwise if you don't have money and resources, use alpha and beta tests and let users into your platform via invites or in batches of a 100 at a time. This way you won't profit from that bad event at the other platform, but at least your platform is usable and you can slowly work out the bottlenecks to scale better.

The block chain can already be used for that. The price just needs to be high enough to pay the bills of miners, or maybe not even that when (in the future) miners can live off tx fees.
Or do you mean only a higher price will lead to more popularity? All big banks are already looking at the tech. The bad thing is they're looking to use something different than Bitcoin. But a higher price won't change this as well.

I think he lnows that. The block chain also doesn't do transfers, it's software as well.
So in both cases it's software, but one time using the block chain, one time using a database.
And his point is, the software that uses the block chain isn't faster than the one using the database.

So let's say I create a movie. It belongs to me and I can decide what to do with it, right? So I decide to distribute it under a very restrictive usage license that sais that people may watch it in the cinema, TV and buy copies on DVD, but are never the owners of one of those copies and also they may not copy or redistribute the movie. These are my set rules for my possession.
In your voluntaryism, what's the legal stand of 1) torrent tracking sites that help people copying and redistributing my work without my consent, 2) one click hosters that host and redistribute copies of my work and make it very hard to file removal requests and/or are very slow and uncooperative in following the requests?
Edit: I generally like the philosophy and it's purity, I've never heard of it before. But the above question just popped into my mind because of thread's topic. And also because I know many people who demand ultimate freedom for themselves, but they immediately oppose their own principles when they see other people or companies as "enemies".
Edit 2: I'm surprised about the downvotes. You seem to think I'm asking a rhetorical question to defend the current system. I'm not. I want to know if the person who created something is really free (i.e. he can decide everything regarding his possession) or if the general public's will is seen as more important / if there's a greater good and the individual has to obey that. That point would be missing from the above description of the voluntaryism.

I simply find cash stupid. The coins are heavy and a wallet takes lots of space and if it fits in your back pocket you can't sit comfortably. You have to count bills and coins to pay the right amount (how 1900 is that?) or the casher has to count the change. Sometimes you accidentally pay too much or the cashier doesn't give you the right amount of change. You have to run to an ATM to get new cash. Depending on your bank you might be restricted to their ATMs and have to pay ridiculus fees for using ATMs of other banks. Cash is filthy and full of germs. Pretty often you need to have the exact amount of cash for something, because the bus driver / hot dog seller / ... doesn't have any change left at the end of the day. When pickpocketed, your cash is insta-gone - no passphrase necessary.
I'm really done with cash.
