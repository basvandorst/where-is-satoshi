If you held for less than a year then it’s your regular federal income tax rate

I’ve been waiting too. Their support is nonexistent. I’ll never deal with them again. Best of luck.

This is dumb. It conflates the interpretation of backed. It implies the dollar isn’t backed by something tangible (eg, gold) but then confuses the point by saying bitcoin is backed by a ledger. Bitcoin doesn’t back intrinsic value in any way either.

No, 90% of crypto owners won’t report their gains on their taxes

What are futures?

@_date: 2017-12-29 10:26:20
Yup. You better report it if you’re transacting on gdax or Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:30:52
this is a 100% false statement

I am not debating what accesses the IRS has. Moving a "sizeable" amount of money to an exchange does not trigger an audit. That's simply a fallacy. I can move $10M back and forth from Bank of America to Vanguard and there is nothing that will cause this to trigger an audit.

Disagree. It takes someone that is knowledgeable and savvy with the block explorer tools that exist. It also requires a fiat on ramp exchange to provide some addresses. Additionally, it isn’t feasible for the IRS to do this in an unautomated fashion, it’s too tedious

XRB going insane peeps, hype or legit?

my friend, someone is giving you really bad information and you are just perpetuating it. every exchange in the US has a money market account that allows funds to just sit and do nothing until you are ready to invest. there are literally 0 forms (except for small bits of interest earned) generated from such a transaction. and if your brokerage does not issue a tax form, the IRS does not know about it.
