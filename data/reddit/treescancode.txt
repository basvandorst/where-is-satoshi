Not even remotely analogous.

Yes or no: could the victim theoretically have stopped the theft from occurring? If the answer is yes, then it *must* be partially the victim's fault, however insignificant a role he played. And the answer is yes.

it's sweet that you think things like software licenses really matter to most people, sadly those licenses are violated more than not, generally without anyone being the wiser.
And anyway, my point is just whatever code we come up with, inevitably it will be a trivial matter for most sites running it to get hacked by a determined individual... and if we see BTC flying upwards exponentially and exchanges pushing around hundreds of thousands again... those determined individuals will make themselves known. We need people with serious experience if anything genuinely successful is to come of a project like this.

I'm well aware off that.

um, how do you figure 25,000 combinations?
As far as I can figure, it's practically infinite... Yes, there are only a hand full of starting points (roughly 300), but then my passwords can go in any direction, for as long as I need (wrapping around). And that's excluding trickery like skipping positions, combining cards, personal "salts", etc...

of course. so?
@_date: 2011-06-22 07:08:55
This isn't the real world where you can punish someone. This is the anonymous internet, and a decentralized currency.
At best you can maybe blacklist known stolen BTC with some major exchanges (a horrible solution), but not much else. And that's not much to begin with.
Furthermore, what are you going to do? Start meddling in individual rights? Fine by me, the average person is an idiot. But that wont fly with the hivemind, might as well just use USD if we form our own anarchic fake government with no real world authority or backing but all the annoying intrusive babysitting safety mandates.

well, I can see how that would be nice to believe

I haven't used them for bitcoin, but I've used them regularly for LR-&gt;Paypal.

you don't understand, BITCOIN is safe. As of now, there aren't any known exploits in the protocol itself. I can send and receive bitcoin and never have to worry about it being stolen, if I'm not an idiot. Hackers, thugs, intelligent entrepreneurs, they don't need to worry about their btc falling to 0 (though they probably don't appreciate the volatile exchange-rate to practical currencies). There is no anarchy in bitcoin. You can throw all the resources you want, short of walking over and stealing the physical hard drive, you can not steal my btc.
The problem are these *centralized* 3rd party providers. They create vulnerabilities where previously there were none, they undermine confidence through their irresponsibility, they provide the gateway for theft. What's bitcoin? open source, secure, decentralized, anonymous. What's mtgox or mybitcoin or whatever? closed source, centralized, not anonymous (not as anonymous, at any rate), and run with opaque security protocols. And now the idea going around is to have a community run movement to regulate bitcoin with dumb shit like blacklists? I have a better idea. How about no, how about we fix the problem at it's root instead of just slapping on bandaids, remove the need for these services to exist in the first place. They're the problem, so instead of *fixing* them, lets remove/reduce them from the equation! Make clients easier/simpler so we don't have ewallets anymore, provide extremely simple straightforward tutorials to teach people about covering their ass online. For exchanges, it'll still be centralized... but instead of storing the money on the exchange and creating a security risk, just have them be browser-based versions of

That's what *THEY* want you to think
@_date: 2011-06-22 22:48:29
I would, but frankly I OSS status is a very secondary issue for me compared to security. And there's no guarantee that exchange ABC is really running the OSS version without any insecure modifications or malicious intent, and no guarantee that their remaining stack or operating procedures are safe. Nothing stops them from giving out read access to their primary DB to auditors with insecure machines :P

anonymity related stuff -&gt; 
It's main weakness is it's main advantage: all transactions are completely public, which ID owns which coin is always known, as well as all historical data.

You forgot about morons trying to make a quick stupid buck doing the "buy high, sell higher, instant millionaire" thing.
But aside from that, I have to heartily agree.
Not that there's anything wrong with those groups, I happily fall under more than one of them :D
@_date: 2011-06-22 22:54:52
Everything is the result of actions by all involved parties.
Certainly the thief is more responsible, but there's no denying the victim stupidly walking around with a wallet full of cash and no protection in the well known bad part of town is completely without blame.

You remember one color-symbol combination for each website, and a general mental algorithm to expand your password from each website's starting point. It's pretty easy to remember "reddit = red-yen", and then go "ok, here's the row/column. Now go out 32 characters, skip every other, wrap around to a lower row when I run out!"
@_date: 2011-06-22 06:44:14
Set an easy-to-remember seed, print out multiple cards, memorize any nontrivial procedure for deriving your password from the cards, bam beats any password manager.
Though of course, if you can actually memorize true secure/random/unique passwords, obviously that's always the best choice.
