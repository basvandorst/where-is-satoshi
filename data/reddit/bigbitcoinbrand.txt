I'm pretty sure Coinbase released a notice saying withdrawals for bitcoin and eth could be delayed for up to 72 hours.

This is the only post necessary.

Does anyone believe his comments on Bitcoin have anything to do with price swings?
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:40:17
Pretty sure they've allowed this since 2013.

If thats the case then you shouldn't be investing in something you don't understand. lesson learned. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:25:20
this right here
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:37:58
Shhh can't say that here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:29:41
I've been through almost every major pump and correction. You're absolutely right. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:41:15
Number one rule in investing. Don't invest in something you don't understand. If someone put money in Bitcoin not realizing its volatile... well.. that's kinda on them. Also don't invest more than your willing to lose. Pretty simple. True believers in the tech will hold, and Bitcoin will prove why it's here to stay.

you must be new here. welcome

It seems there is a push with certain members of the community to switch to a segwit address. I guess that's with the assumption they are being transacted to help free up space on the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:50:48
This is a joke right?

Does anyone have a good resource to understand the depth charts? I see the wall, just not sure what it means.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:54:13
I only have about $40 in bitcoin, and it won't let me withdraw. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:40:38
I went through a similar rough patch in my life, but I didn't give up. I kept working hard, and I fought my way back. Don't lose hope bud. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:59:25
Still amazes me that "reputable" news outlets tout these "experts" as credible. This guy ran pump and dump penny stocks and was a drug addict, and now he calls Bitcoin dangerous?
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:38:18
You could offer a service and get paid in Bitcoin.

"hope you young folks are listening" No, we hope you dinosaurs are listening. We all accept the fact we need to pay taxes, but that doesn't take away from the taxmans overreaching authority. Glad this is keeping you awake at night. It should.

Bitcash, and Bitcoin Cash (akaBcash) are not the same thing. Not sure if that's what you were thinking. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:32:22
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:31:22
 Or bitcoin segwit
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:41:48
I'm ready!
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:38:08
I guess I'm still trying to understand what Bitcoin is in relation to Blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:08:39
So miners would be forced out of business and Bitcoin would die if prices hit $100 correct?
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:52:28
Theyve been known to pump Bcash.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:29:14
Would mining get easier at $100 per bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:52:22
Yes haha
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:39:48
My last few transactions using segwit were around .30 cents, but that was sending high priority. Moved around 20k. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:32:45
Per Tone Vays, 5k. He's been pretty spot on lately.
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:14:47
Wow for someone that’s had Andreas on several times Joe clearly gets a bit cloudy here. I mean he admits he’s not a smart guy, but he just makes zero sense. I like his show but he did in fact butcher it. It’s not really that complicated. Smoke em if you got em I guess. Someone should create golden fucking pony dollars. Sweet freaking Jesus Joe.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:53:11
So Russia legalizing it makes it a wash.

Tone Vays has become my favorite Bitcoin youtuber. Thanks for all your hard work Tone.

The same money that pushed it down is about to push it back up. Dont get rekt.. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:56:39
are you saying that with a straight face right? Son, I've been in the game for a long time. I'm teasing you a bit here obviously. But bitcoin has more on it's side than you make it seem. Saying it's scary is pretty weak imo. I'm not going to list all these things for you but you can look it up. Aside from what it is now, the best crypto developers in the world are working on lighting network. (you can also look that up). Take a look at the historical price chart. You do realize this happens over and over in cycles right? So this is it huh? The end is near? Bro... please. I was trying to help you from getting rekt.

@_date: 2018-03-08 18:56:57
He doesn't mention Bitcoin specifically. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:51:47
I don't know about other long term bitcoin holders, but I keep a running mental checklist. I'm loyal to btc. It was what I signed up for. I dont care about infighting. Bitcoin works just fine for me. Yes sometimes it can be a little slower to transact, or can be a bit more pricey, but I'm understanding of the technology, and it need for growing room.  For people like Roger Ver who divide a community because we need faster cheaper transactions now? Unless I'm missing something, Id rather have a unified community with slower growth. So I'll add shape shift to my list of companies I'll never use. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:48:37
He also promotes a UBI. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:42:12
I thought Erlich would be missed but honestly didn't miss his character and he's one of my favorites. Jian Yang plays a bigger role. Haven't seen the third episode yet. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:11:26
And this just brings us back to the debate on bcash vs bitcoin. Bitcoin devs seem to take the slow and steady approach, and bcash wants fast free right now. Why can't bitcoin be a store of value now, then once development for transactions get up to speed it could act as a currency? non debate imo. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:14:08
If a different altcoin blew by btc marketcap I'd be concerned as a holder. This is also if bitcoin took a dump.  Otherwise the payment system will develop when it's ready. I kinda trust the smartest guys/gals in the room. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:58:37
I forget the host's name, but he was a major proponent of bitcoin back in the day. Haven't seen him in awhile. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:36:45
I'm sorry in regards to what? trusting the smartest people in the room?
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:23:46
Nice yup. Seems like so long ago now.
