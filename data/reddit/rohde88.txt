Anal-ize. Sounds painful

Between -600 and the moon.

Yep totally in the same position but I was more referring to self promotion on the sub. Glad there are professionals here though!

Mining offers a hedge against a downturn in price decreases. Own the GPus. Salvage value even if ether is at 0.

Law firm here. Accept bitcoin, ETH, litecoin, etc.

Curious to see if mods allow this. I’m a lawyer in Texas. Lots of crypto clients now business, contracts, etc.

Yea, thats  a good plan.
Who's selling RE for crypto? (direct settlement, not a settlement into USD at closing)
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:00:42
Amen. Lawyers accept fees in crypto too

Buy income producing real estate. There are sellers now who will trade rental properties for bitcoin.

Its technically a barter. Pay tax on fair market value minus basis. In reality it’s pretty difficult to track or prove. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:37:41
Haha! Glad OP has a sense of humor and charity!

Private sales is the way to go
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:48:48
Are you referring to a 1031 exchange? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:24:48
Private sales
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:51:00
What state are you in? TX lawyer here. 
Also, switch to private exchanges to avoid getting your real money frozen!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:04:05
Oh, I thought you were implying crypto would qualify for 1031, to my knowledge, nothing has been put out yet.

PR is a good answer for flexible people

Yep and slicing some capital appreciation for steady income producing property is a natural hedge of the wealthy. Buy real estate with crypto!
