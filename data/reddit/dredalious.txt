I work in 'normal' finance as backend IT'er and agree with the title of the post but not the content.
Security should be a primary concern, margin and account management as well.
Exchanges should use standards (or develop if existing standards for exchanges don't fit).
How or what the best security is, that's a tad bit more complicated question. It's not just one thing here or there, it's a combination of a lot of things, and I mean A LOT. Servers need to be hardened, SSL enforced, limited internet access for some vital parts, audit and security logging must be complete, ... These are only the most basic of rules for all enterprise applications. End-users on trading grounds should be able to use multi factor authentication (and mandatory above a certain number of bitcoins), and based on the size and risk the multifactor mechanisms change, from an google authenticator to an SMS to a VASCO security card and verified accounts by proof or residence (all this for bigger accounts).
As with 'real' exchanges, triggers need to be build in to halt market when trades are detected that don't seem 100% safe, trade validity needs to be checked thoroughly and limits need to be in place. For all the anonymity bitcoins offers, if you're trading millions of $$ the first month you register, you're probably a criminal.
Most of this is thus not a technical issue, but paper work and rules. But since bitcoin is a decentralised coin with no owner, the exchanges group should set rules and make sure exchanges comply (set them on a safe list, promote them, ...)
