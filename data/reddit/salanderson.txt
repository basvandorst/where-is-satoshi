This app is awesome! Beats Coinpocket by a mile. Please don't be a super scammer and steal my BTC though.

Can you transfer to okpay still using transfer wise? 
@_date: 2014-06-09 22:39:14
What do they gain from hiding? 
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:19:16
Regardless, there shouldn't have to be trust involved. Missing the point Gavin.

Which country does he work in? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:52:17
From an average, nontechnical minded person this looks pretty cool. 
I would like some credit to give it a go. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 19:46:23
I'm still waiting too, my friend who just signed up got an invite straight away. He's a total bitcoin noob so I guess they are sticking to their word in that sense. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:01:41
Thanks man :) 
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:15:45
Excellent plan

Fantastic. Well happy I got my first name as my username!
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:24:20
Surely sellers would be able to offer producs at a lower price due to not having to pay silly fees to eBay and PayPal? 
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:49:54
At what exactly? 
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:41:20
Moronic question: 
If I made an offline wallet and the sent btc to it from my blockchain wallet, would the offline wallet balance stay at 0 until I connected it to the internet? 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:43:00
I wish I could get this in the UK
@_date: 2014-06-01 22:13:00
The music alone got me excited 
@_date: 2014-06-01 22:07:16
Sounds like a great idea to me... although I would like to see a critique post from someone here who isn't a Tech Buffoon like myself.

Well, for a start, pretty well much every structure in the world would collapse

Does anyone have a referrer code I can use? 
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:27:29
Your average person doesn't pay attention to most stuff until other people are. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:20:57
Finally. I feel like the UK is lagging behind a bit in the bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:16:49
Internet breaks.

I use Pheeva as the username function enables my bitnoob friends to pick up the basics of Bitcoin transactions a little quicker.

If bitcoin does make it to the moon, won't the massive amount of computing power leave an extremely large carbon footprint? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:16:42
Is there a uk version if this site?

Frustrating that you have to fill an order form in, I'm happy to give a donation but I don't want to give all my details. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:47:04
I think it is incredibly impressive. Do you not recall when you knew no one who knew what Bitcoin is? It takes time.
The title of this Reddit post should read, 30% of Americans surveyed now aware of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:01:38
Where does yahoo pull the data from? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:38:46
Anything that requires trust shouldn't be allowed. Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:57:28
I've read many comments since the Microsoft news broke saying that the main impact will be on young, unbanked market. I highly doubt this market will care about, or even notice the 1%. 
That being said, I think Microsoft using increments is stupid. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:23:57
If you have a sizable amount you could consider donating it to a local charity and offering a press release &amp; interviews. Could prove a good way to gain local interest.
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:55:04
I feel bad saying this but I can't wait until coinmap becomes obsolete.
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:40:53
Well we had to start somewhere
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:44:42
It's not just the sales. It's the PR that comes with it, as bitcoin gains traction these companies will be mentioned in a high percentage of bitcon's media coverage.

Is there any firsthand user experience stories of a robocoin ATM? Mainly interested from the point of view of the owner

In which year did internet start ups achieve such levels of investment?
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:03:32
What about projects like bitsquare? 
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:54:48
What's you website?
@_date: 2015-01-06 11:07:19
Not a company, but if the internet ceased to exist, Bitcoin would be screwed.

I sent 0.1BTC with no fee from my blockchain.info wallet to my Local Bitcoin wallet with no fee and it still has 0 confirmations. This method worked for me pretty quickly in the past. Why is it not working for me now, how long will this transfer take and what sort of %age fee should I pay in the future to avoid this situation again?
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:46:06
How much fee should I pay?
@_date: 2015-07-28 16:05:28

Although I am desperate to promote bitcoin just like you say I had to steer my question in a different direction and ask of his favorite cheese. 
There's pressing matters in life and then there's cheese.

It depends what you consider low
