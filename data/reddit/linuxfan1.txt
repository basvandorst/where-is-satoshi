Never invest money you're not willing to lose. If Bitcoin takes a dump how are you going to pay off that loan? Buy parts of Bitcoin every month that you CAN afford at the time until you get to .5 Bitcoin

Nah, SF smells like piss mostly. Easier to hide
Deadass, I went to SF and we were getting in an elevator to go to the subway and a guy on the street who was standing there for a while said "I wouldn't go in there, the floor is covered in piss".
The doors opened and it looked as if it had rained inside.

$1.6 billion in Bitcoin?! Who knew $2 billion of Bitcoin could fit in that small of a space. I don't know what I'd do without $500 million in Bitcoin.

Do it then. Wait, you can't? Why not? It's pretty easy don't you think?
