What the fuck does that have to do with the ISO standard? Without the adherence to some standards (like the naming standard for currency, which Bitcoin currently abides by) you can never expect wide acceptance.

Several uplinks/connections usually powered by a botnet of regular consumer pcs. That is why DDoS is so hard to defend against.

The same logic applies to regular email spam as well, even with a 1% success rate it's worth it.
