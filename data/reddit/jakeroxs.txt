If only core wasn't the man on the podium...
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:50:39
Sounds fake.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:52:25
This is so dumb, on Bitcoin.com they clearly have a BTC and BCH ticker separately. The wallet clearly differentiates between BCH and BTC as well. Shills gonna shill though.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:41:19
Wow an article clearly explaining the differences and reason for BCH being forked? You're right it's so misleading ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:23:36
Haha nah dude just don't think about it, be enraged about Roger or whoever.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:22:41
It was publicly viewable they had implemented it into their API prior to this post, hence people saying "it's basically confirmed now" because of the wallet API being added.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:24:35
They said "by January 1st" not on the 1st.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:54:25
Rofl, well if you focus on one specific argument sure. Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin, it's built off the same initial technology and many see it as following the original white paper more. Please show me in the white paper where Satoshi said we should keep blocks locked at 1mb and scale OFF CHAIN.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:53:33
Such response, it's funny you say others just follow Roger Ver, yet it seems you are the one resorting to arguments from authority.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:49:49
It was much later, [here]( is the link from August. No where does it say trading enabled later.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:54
Rofl he's making actual conversation, you are the only troll here. Roger didn't create bch, he is an outspoken individual who is invested in crypto heavily. He isn't a dev
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:47:00
Haha I bought in a couple weeks ago at $5600 :D unfortunately I only had $50 to spend but hey sitting at $62 is cool.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:06:57
Can someone explain why this is a good thing? Don't we want to keep big banks out of this? Why would we want people to be speculating on the price of btc without having any skin in the game (so to speak).
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:14:14
After fixing the fees maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:28:42
Surprised this thread hasn't been "sanitized" yet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:06:53
Haha damn, I had a similar situation where I bought $200 at $703, spent most of it and left the rest in a wallet on my comp, fast forward to a few months ago, struggling to pay rent I remember that wallet and see that what had to have been like $30 at most was now $200. Sold at $3978.*Helped get through that month but now I'm kicking myself a bit as it has almost doubled.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:14:19
I'm so glad someone else is saying this.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:50:50
Proof? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:47:24
The bitcoin account is run by a person who also decided that they preferred the BCH scaling method. There is no conspiracy or underhanded tactics here, a person changed their mind. Now I hear you saying the account was obviously compromised or sold! That is definitely plausible, I don't have evidence either way to support that though and I bet you don't either. Twitter might know but they have a rule against that and would have noticed the account is being accessed by someone else, so why haven't they taken action?
Bitcoin is a protocol, people who disagreed with the core developer road map of Lightning Network and preferred to scale on chain *for now*. There was a lot of discussion on this sub about it before the split you know? Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic were all developers ideas of how to go about scaling the blocksize. Segwit2x was the compromise, small block increase now and Segwit for LN. Best of both worlds, Segwit (even though many were against it) would go in first, then the blocksize would be increased a little bit later. As the the Segwit activation came closer it became clear that the Core team had no intention of going through with the compromise. Thus BCH, and many of the previously mentioned development teams decided they were clearly not welcome to develop for the BTC chain, and took their code to BCH.
Bitcoin is the protocol, there are now two main forks of that protocol, BTC whose intention is to scale through side chains, and BCH whose intention is to scale on chain, until no longer possible under reasonable circumstances. The people saying BCH is Bitcoin aren't lying or trying to scam when they say that, they are pointing out that it is the same protocol, the same chain (up until split) and the same mining algorithm. It is technically and developmentally Bitcoin. Naturally people will take sides, we just have to try and be reasonable, these are just two different ideas sprouted from the same tree that was planted by Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:56:29
Sounds like giving up BTC all together...
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:47:27
I didn't, I'm pointing out having a sidechain on top of a sidechain doesn't sound like Bitcoin to me.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:24:38
No it's Bitcoin Cash right now, there is no name confusion, check out Bitpay, they clearly mark them as distinctly different. That's why many prefer the green logo as well, it differentiates it enough but still shows that it's roots are firmly planted in its protocol, the Bitcoin protocol. That sounds like a bad ass movie title :p
As far as you're concerned it's over, I get that and that's fine for you to believe, just don't pretend everyone else agrees with you, and anyone who doesn't is just out to get you somehow.
Edit: I think the naming confusion has been a pushed narrative anyway, especially at this point. BCH is distinctly different on the majority of exchanges and payment processors, the new address format even completely removes the accidental sending to the wrong address.
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:25:06
What a good argument!
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:43:02
Lol OK, love this community so much
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:32:21
I'm not contradicting my self at all, the Twitter account bitcoin has only changed their opinions, there is no pretending that BCH is the same bitcoin as BTC. The bitcoin account has been around for awhile, why would you expect them to change their name and logo simply because of a change of opinion? That's not how it works! They didn't intend to move to a different coin when they created the account, the situation as they perceive it caused them to change their mind after already cementing themselves in the Twitter account. Same with the Bitcoin.com website, it was created for the only Bitcoin at the time, now there are two and the owner made the decision to support both. Clearly explained why they did, and still are accused of trying to scam people, that's not how scamming works fundamentally.
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:23:22
Right, it really doesn't make sense, seems more like he is trying to spread misinformation, why would a Bitcoin Cash supporter hack a well known account and post things that look obviously like they are from someone else. As soon as Cobra gained the account back they'd immediately tell everyone they were hacked. So it wouldn't fool anyone for long so why even? All it does is make Bitcoin Cash supporters look bad. And Cobra I suppose for not following basic account protection steps :/
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:47:58
Haha the tweet is not the meat of the argument, read what the tweet was referencing maybe
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:29:42
Thanks! Didn't answer the why though...
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:57:31
It hasn't changed its name or symbol because the person behind it has supported Bitcoin for a long time, why wouldn't they have the Bitcoin name and a bitcoin symbol as their avatar? Are you kidding?
You talk as if this is over, BTC price could drop at any moment. Hell all of crypto seems to be inflated to shit with ICOs and Bitconnects. Point is, people are going to call things whatever they want, Bitcoin is a protocol, not a brand, no one owns Bitcoin, and yet everyone does.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:12:00
So Mike talking about batching transactions referencing Satoshi somehow directly related to LN? Off chain TX will happen ofc but pushing the majority off chain is not the point Satoshi was going for.
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:14:59
5 week old account, yeah you totally know what you are talking about xD
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:28:08
It took them 6 months to dump BCH?
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:13:44
Why? I am one person with an opinion, I'd rather not be like some others who create multiple accounts just to upvote themselves. I don't pretend to be anonymous online either, we are tracked online by govt and other agencies anyway
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:53:20
Hmm I actually dumped mine pretty quickly after the fork, kinda funny now. I just followed the propaganda saying it was a quick scam coin.
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:24:53
Lol, the downvotes are tasty. Don't know how my comment had anything to do with BCH xD
My point is if everything is happening on sidechains that doesn't really seem like bitcoin to me.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:51:20
Look before when it was just posting price... 
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:16:28
They actually said initially they wouldn't give both coins, but they would see how the market played out. I have the email from them still, I just moved my coins into copay and got my bch/bcc after the split.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:07:38
Ver doesn't control BCH, bitcoin.com is one website, that has nothing to do with development on the network. On the Bitcoin.com website if you go to the buy tab and click buy bitcoin, it defaults to BTC, the only place they are displayed that way is on the blockchain explorer, which is hardly what they are claiming people are getting confused about.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:44:24
Ahh you're talking about Satoshi right? If so you'd be surprised who's leading BTC development these days...
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:59:20
Classic response
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:36:27
Fork.lol, either you're intentionally lying or you aren't actually a miner... Wouldn't be surprised with either.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:46:04
Exactly. I'd like to point out the default sorting in this post is "Suggested" funny, almost like it's being manipulated for a certain view at the top...
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:28:37
Ah so because I disagree with you, I'm uneducated in general and know nothing about civil cases specifically. Amazing you could gather that much information from the two comments on this thread.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:59:00
I've mentioned nothing about the civil case, not sure what comments you've been reading then.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:53:00
That can change at any time, miners can decide to move to either coin.
