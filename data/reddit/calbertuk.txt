So you use fake identities with the exchange, then manage to open a bank account with that fake identity, then manage to explain to your bank where those millions are coming from, then you manage to explain to the government where all that money is coming from.
Piece of cake.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:21:00
What exchange is gonna let you transfer large amount of BTC to fiat without asking a lot of questions and all type of IDs?
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:08:45
You are talking out of your arse
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:02:13
They won't know the coins may have been stolen that's irrelevant. You can't just go to an exchange and exchange large sums of money without raising a few eyebrows.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:29:45
Yeah but if you steal 60 millions, you want to actually be able to use it. I wouldn't want to use that shit to buy $50 of groceries every week. Realistically, using anymore than a few thousands is gonna take a lot of work. Fake identities and so on. Even if you fool exchanges with your IDs then you still have to fool a bank and a government. Even if somehow you did manage to get it onto a bank account, you'd have to launder it if you were going to spend it without ending up in jail.
People are making it sound like it's easy, it's really not.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:49:37
No it won't be. It might be worth a dollar at the very best and that would be if Bitcoin is the world wide currency which it probably won't be.
Also transaction are at least $10 at the moment so Coinbase isn't gonna pay that for you to withdraw less than dust.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:01:12
Worst they can do is close your account so you'd have to find another bank, they can't steal your money.
Gains are realised when you trade your coins for GBP not when you withdraw your GBP to your accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:11:27


It is, but they're the rules.
To be honest unless you're talking large sums I wouldn't worry about it. You have a capital gains allowance as well which is like 11k so it's not gonna be much of a concern unless you're paying off a house or something.
Anyways, I've had numerous withdrawals coming from coinfloor/kraken and never had any issues.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:46:17
lmao what is this
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:17:26
Never go full retard
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:54:57
I waited seven hours at 350sat/byte...
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:16:10
You can try child-pays-for-parent from Electrum, it  usually works. Your transaction will take weeks to confirm with a fee this low.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:32:14
Not with 1000 sat per byte.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:13:25
It's pretty crazy to be this brainwashed that you take offense to legitimate critics of Bitcoin.
Also I am a coder, k, thx.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:04:37


I'm fairly certain it is done. There is a stackexchange article about it but I cannot find it. It's a common way to speed up a transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:31:56
Don't assume I'm advocating holding either but with bigger block sizes the current congestion wouldn't be there as BCH wouldn't even be at capacity like Bitcoin currently is.
We won't have wide scale overnight, it'll take many many different improvements. Look at Ethereum, they are constantly doing various improvements meant to improve scalability. Meanwhile, a debacle on segwit split the community in half, took years to come through and fees are through the roof with the mempool having 100k+ transactions in it for two weeks.
At this stage, Bitcoin needs to dramatically improve or all those newcomers won't take long to realise that it's broken and that the only advantage it has is being the first crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:32:36
I'm not sure how to do it in core but I'm sure it's possible. Transaction will get discarded after two weeks,.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:40:13
I think we can all agree that we'd much rather pay $30 in fees rather than have bigger blocks /s
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:24:00
Welcome to Bitcoin, where $10 in fees gets your transaction confirmed in only 8 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:54:04
There is 200k pending transactions in the mempool and transactions with $20 in fees take eight hours to confirm but let's worry about what some guy said on a youtube video instead.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:36:41
Miners would try to pick up the previous transaction though wouldn't they?
Anyways, any standard 1000 sat per byte transaction will confirm immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:51
How stupid... Loads of transactions doesn't mean it's under attack, just means loads of people are using it.
The fact that it's not working properly isn't something we should ignore either.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:06:49
Yeah cause segwit was a smooth ride. Just another ten years and 150 forks before lighting network
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:21:32
Same question, I've got an offline laptop running an old version. Do I need to update or am I fine with the old one for the foreseeable future?
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:29:27
Coinbase wouldn't give them shit if they knew this was ransom money.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:33:54
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:20:06
You would need to import your paper wallet twice, once for BTC and once for BCC (though they would be the same wallet) and then you'd have 10 coins on each wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:50:11
You have one large business that's doing great despite a lot of regulatory nonsense, all the others are folding one after the other because of regulatory issue or incapacity to find banking partners.
No wonder Bitcoin businesses wanna stay away from the States when you see what happens to BTC-e.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:02:48
IOTA is because of some nonsense with the network, check twitter.
If you have USD, you'll have to withdraw it in crypto to another exchange and then get your cash out from there...
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:05:16
BCC is essentially just copying the entire bitcoin ledger and calling it something different.
To redeem BCC, you will need to import your BTC private keys into a BCC wallet and your coins will exist in two different places.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:28:21
Sounds like running a compliant Bitcoin business in the US is close to impossible. Shame that a country that used to be ahead of everyone when it came to tech is now becoming so backwards.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:53:06
*for all exchanges who want to deal with US customers.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:05:11


Allegedly, no? But fuck due process in the USA. If we think you might be doing something illegal, we'll shut you down, take your money and your users' money, doesn't matter if your users aren't all American, doesn't matter the laws of your country. World police to the rescue.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:42:10
It's a way to pay an extra fee for your transaction to confirm faster. You can do that from electrum wallet or pay someone to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:57:40
Interesting, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:06:57
Of course it'll work if you pay enough fees.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:35:18
I upvoted this so people can see the level of retardation you get to enjoy by browsing new on this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:09:54
Should confirm in the 12 hours or so in theory.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:03:37
Shouldn't it just grab as many transactions from the mempool as possible though?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:01:10
Use this 
Give me your transaction id
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:47:45
You can try "child pays for parent" or be patient.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:59:08
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:47:06
The level of stupidity on this sub is just mind blowing.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:24:01
Thanks I got some help on IRC and they suggested that as well so I've done "child pays for parent" and waiting it hopefully resolves in the next hour.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:13:21
explorer says Fee per byte	50 sat/B 
(paid 0.000218 BTC)
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:18:42
It says it should be around 40 minutes, is that inaccurate or did I do something wrong?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:25:57
Fidor isn't on faster payments so uk to uk transfers will take a couple of hours. They're also personal accounts so not really suitable
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:55:40
Pretty much. So much for decentralisation.
No wonder ETH is getting so much traction those days.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:33:59
Yeah and the fact that ethereum confirms in 15 minutes and bitcoin a few hours. Ethereum is well ran, Bitcoin is ran by Chinese miners who've been giving us the middle finger for a long time
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:53:31
Having done this a few times, the transfer to kraken cost £2.5 and the exchange rate is very very close to the spot one, it's honestly a great option. Fidor are very bitcoin friendly so you're completely safe with them which is great. You will make a little bit less than selling on Bitty or Localbitcoins but your accounts won't be at risk.
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:26:49
If you are in the UK, Coinfloor. But if you're selling on Bitty or Localbitcoins, this was bound to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:26:30
At least the people in power have the coin's best interest at heart. Our network is pretty much owned by the Chinese miners who will always do whatever gets them paid the most regardless of how badly it hinders bitcoin. I trade Bitcoin daily on Kraken, I've had transactions that took over 6 hours with fees over $5. A few years ago people were talking about bitcoin like it was gonna revolutionlise the banking industry and now UK bank transfers are free and instant and a bitcoin transaction takes hours (on a good day) and costs ridiculous amounts of money. If we can't get the miners to do what's best for bitcoin then this is nothing but a failed experiment.
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:56:40
Nothing but it means as pointed out that you're accepting transfers and cash deposits from random people with a personal bank account. 
I was in this business for a few months and it's no secret your accounts will eventually get shut down (and nobody at Bitty or localbitcoins hide that fact).
Just consider yourself lucky you don't end up with a CIFAS record like many sellers do
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:15:55
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:17:44
I mean I'll take Vitalik over a dozen Chinese men who're happy with $6 tx fees and increasingly slow transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:35:01
Get a fidor account (you can open one online and they're bitcoin friendly) and use kraken.
