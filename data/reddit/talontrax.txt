Screw filling that! If they want to audit one penny, go for it!

You're making it worse.

You could use ketchup as the glue.

But his speedometer says he's not moving.

So TRUE!

Best post I've ever seen on this sub and it matched perfectly!

In the first one, about 2-3 months ago, the Mods for a period of about 4 weeks posted a sticky (that's no longer there) that said if anyone posts any of the following, you're banned... and they preceded to list every type of topic that the sub was known for. Basically, if you didn't post a picture of a kitten or a rainbow, your post was removed. The sub got real slow, days with no posts, so another sub was made.
I don't like drama and I didn't care to find out the whole story, so I just joined the new and left the old. I think the Mods were mad at some new Reddit rules admins came up with, so they made that complete exclusionary list an effort to protest, but instead they just lost subscribers. Now there's 1M+? I don't care.

When did I enter r/imgoingtohellforthis2 ?
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:35:45
Or Fortran.
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:08:22
I think this as well. Likely lower than before, too.

It's a bad idea too. Automated to give alerts maybe, but not actual trading.
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:06:58
Ditto. Same user. Ban-Hammer!
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:36:04
And Firefly.

Yes, but does it do convection cooking?
