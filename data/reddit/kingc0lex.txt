Reach out to the company? Not trying to be sarcastic / a dick but they probably have all the information you need.

Is adding the ten thousandth cash kiosk news now? The title doesn’t even make sense. It’s not an ATM.

If you want to pay with cash, in-person. If you want to pay with debit, ATM.

Interesting, so you need to sell &gt; $3,750 to make more than $150. That seems reasonable? Is there a daily max? One or two buys could get you set up.

Hmm. $150 feels low. Are you in a high foot traffic area? What is the % of the transaction? Do you expect that to come into play? Who tracks that?

You need to post on social media blasting them or they won’t do a thing. Or complain to their regulators. Bitcoin atms quickly becoming like the western union and airlines of the legacy system. Shameful.

Digital mint is at fault for enabling this. She should go after them. They are the only ones that can make her whole. This is poor kyc and they should know better.
