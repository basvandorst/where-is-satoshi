The price drop is interesting. I think that all entry-level mining products will see a similar fate, though: as soon as they are released, they are behind in the mining arms race and the time it takes to recoup the purchase price lengthens. 
I wonder if ASICM have invested in too much Blade Eruptor stock that they will struggle to shift...

"Come on to the radar"? Well... bitcoin has been on HMRC's radar for a while. Back in 2011 HMRC made a statement saying people would only be liable for tax if they turned bitcoin into "regular cash".[1] 
As for recognising Bitcoin as a currency in itself, HMRC have replied to enquiries pretty recently saying they regard it as something more like a store voucher, rather than money, but that's more from a business viewpoint with regards to VAT etc.[2] And of course, how they categorise bitcoin might change.
As for UK exchanges, this [Bitcointalk thread]( has a lot of good discussion on Bitcoin's uptake in the UK.

The miner that processes the block that contains the transaction gets the fee. They can send it to an address they like. It isn't distributed among subsequent confirmers.
Confirmations go up by one when a new block is found. They don't stop at six. (Six is just deemed enough to prevent any chance of double-spending, which is why it's a kind of standard in clients and services.) 
To check this, view the transaction id of an old transaction in your client and/or blockchain.info. The older the transaction, the more confirmations it will have, and the number will increment when a new block is mined.

Well, you said "Your 'money' (Bitcoin) will be worth more" as though it was an answer to "Why bitcoin?" If it's not a definite truth (and it isn't) maybe it needs to come with a disclaimer, or not be said at all.


Forgive me, but everything you've described here -- government and businesses having to declare accounts, charities having to report income, traceable donations, suspicious payments investigated  -- could also be implemented -- is already implemented, to an extent -- with existing currencies. 
Like you say, bitcoin is traceable up until the point someone tries to hide it. Just like existing currencies. And I'm not sure it's "fair to assume" that it would become law to publicly identify national expenses just because the records are there in the blockchain. In the UK, it took a long time for the expense accounts of politicians to be made public, and the barrier wasn't that there were no records. 
I think saying bitcoin is both transparent and anonymous-if-you-make-an-effort is trying to have your cake and eat it.

You wrote as though that premise (bitcoin going up) is the only one that exists. "*Once bitcoin doubles  ... will ... will only grow ...*"
But you don't know what's going to happen to bitcoin. No-one does. It's an experiment. What if it doesn't "only grow", or "double a few more times", but actually stagnates, and / or withers away into irrelevance?
Too often people talk about bitcoin in certainties and absolutes. Some do it deliberately, others slip into it unknowingly. Either way, it doesn't do anyone any good. It inflates hype and leads to misplaced and overestimated expectations.
Compare your last sentence to this one: 
"If bitcoin were to double a few more times, it [an mBTC] would be valued at well over a dollar, and might grow from there."

OK: we have some figures from the poll, but enough about the poll itself. I would like to know:
1. How many questions were in the survey?
2. What were the actual questions? Wording is important.
3. What was the audience size?
4. Was the poll target to men, women or both?
5. Was the poll targeted to a particular age group?
Without knowing those things we can't really give any weight to the figures. 
Here is the On Device Research website:
They have panels of  "mobile users" for "in the moment" research, and also "niche respondents", such as "tablet users, young people and gamers". 
Did st-art use either of those for this poll? If so, it's misleading to say "a third of Britons", as though the poll audience is a demographic representation of the country as a whole.

Yes, I have the same opinion as you as bitcoin and "digital content". 
You might already know this, but in the UK, HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) has indicated that at the moment they see bitcoin as something like a gift voucher. This was in response to enquiries about VAT implications from companies that accept bitcoin.
HMRC can change its interpretation, of course, but I think at the moment it sees bitcoin as a more versatile version of something like Microsoft or Nintendo Points, because the market for bitcoin is still relatively so small.

Even if that's not typical of your average turnout, and the gender balance is usually more equal, it still adds to the general impression the article gives that Bitcoin is mainly a Boy's Club.

You don't need to "get rid" of the address. Just don't use it. 
Yes, you could create a brand new wallet of addresses with a new seed, if you deleted then reinstalled Electrum. Obviously, you would lose any balances you had in the old wallet, though.
Each address has its own private key. But the neat thing about Electrum is that it is a "deterministic" wallet.
This means that as long as you remember the twelve-word seed, you can rebuild all the addresses in the wallet on another install of Electrum -- even on two computers at the same time.
If you don't have the twelve-word seed, you won't be able to recreate the wallet. So write it down now, if you haven't already :)
You can also export the private keys to the addresses in the wallet, to back them up. You might do this if one day you want to import the addresses into another bitcoin client.
Note that if you *import* an address into Electrum, using its private key, you won't be able to restore that from the twelve-word seed. The seed is only good for the addresses Electrum generates.

* you write about both "profit" and "interest" -- the text underneath the bomb images says "interest"
* the first and last sentence use the passive ("a bomb is bought" / "Each time the bomb is grabbed")
This is the first thing people visiting the website see. On my 1280 x 800 screen it takes up half the screen space, so it might be worth testing alternatives that are easier to scan. Bullet points, perhaps? A diagram? A video?
As for the actual concept, it doesn't really appeal to me. I wouldn't like the chore of getting rid of the bomb, and would feel a bit like I was spamming my friends if I pestered them about it.
One other advantage that Satoshi Dice and other lottery sites have is they provide a very quick outcome. You send BTC to an address, or you spin the wheel / whatever, and very quickly you know if you won or lost. Much quicker than a possible 24 hours of trying to sell the coinbomb you've bought. Perhaps you could offer shorter games? 12 hours? 6 hours? 1 hour?
Best of luck.

They must get asked this a lot -- they have a page for it:
(Although, they should probably change the line under Try It! that says "Just buy 1 or 2 BTC!" to something smaller...)
It's a marketplace to connect sellers directly with buyers. Sellers have ratings and links to their usernames on other forums, so you can do a bit of research about them.
Never used it myself (no need) but have read positive stories about them here on reddit. Major complaint is that prices are usually above the exchanges, but that's to be expected when you can buy in such small amounts.

Why? Your "open letter" starts off saying if Tor accepted BTC they'd be able to


Tor's [donation page]( as Unit237 points out [above]( tells people to donate BTC to do just that.
It's not like Tor is unaware of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A large part of Tor's financing comes from US government grants, though, and they are a registered non-profit. I'm not an American tax lawyer, but maybe the logistical issues around accepting BTC donations just aren't worth it at this time.
Have you tried emailing Tor to ask why they don't accept BTC directly?

Some wise words here.
I wish people who are not carried away by bitcoin were accepted more in this subreddit. I remember seeing someone downvoted heavily in a "What price do you think it will be in X?" thread for giving a figure that was less than the current value. 
Not everyone who doubts bitcoin is an idiot. Not everyone who points out barriers to its usefulness or suitability is a luddite with blinkers on. I think there's a lot of room for healthy realism and skepticism about bitcoin's shortcomings. 
Yes, the subreddit has moved on from the days when people would post the price, a meme picture and slap themselves on the back. But even lately, I've read a lot of stuff by people who clearly believe the only way is up, and that bitcoin is going to bring about some kind of geopolitical revolution during which nonbelievers will be kicked into the sea. Even at a more mundane level, a lot of the discussion is still mined* from the "how to make money out of bitcoin" seam, and not the "how to use bitcoin" quarry.
Like OP said, it's an experiment. Even Satoshi himself said there might be no volume in 20 years.

147 fun spins later, here are my thoughts:
* Addictive!
* Presentation -- visual, sound, animation -- is great. I like the deep red and gold colourscheme, and little things like the way my balance increments up with sound when I win, but not when I lose.
* Love that I can try my luck different circles
* Like the extras such as the Monthly Draw
Some suggestions, if I may be so bold:
* Make it more obvious that you can set a custom wager amount by clicking the value. 
* Allow the user to set a custom wager by percentage, rather than a fixed amount
* Have an extra row, under the wager and balance box, with buttons for custom values. Custom percentages would probably work better than values here, because of space concerns. I bet Martingalers would love to be able to set 2, 4, 6 or 8; or 5, 10, 20 etc; or Fibonnacinuts 1,2,3,5 and so on.
* I'd love more statistics about the activity associated with that deposit address. Figures for questions like: What is my turnover? What is my return? Which result do I land on most often? What's my longest win / lose streak? 
* A Satoshislot or Satoshibandit spin-off (pun intended) ;-)

I perhaps didn't phrase the SEPA point very well. I meant in countries outside the eurozone (e.g. PL, CH), they're not going to charge customers in euros. Most of the bank's customers will be local. 
As for becoming a payment processor, I don't think this is about legislators not liking bitcoin in itself. In the UK, for example, there's a lot of red tape *anywhere* money is involved even before you get to "unlimited amount" stage. And that's in one country. When you're then talking about the possibility of transferring a potentially unlimited amount of money to any one of 500 million people, cross-border, up come the barriers.
All that said, I think you're are absolutely right -- a delay of longer than a month is awful without communication and very bad even with. And MtGox's help and support pages are a bit of a mess!

Perhaps they don't need to. Perhaps they have a smooth enough payment system already.
Perhaps they've done a cost analysis. Perhaps they've looked at the size of the BTC market -- that is, how many people would be likely to pay if they offered bitcoin as an option -- and decided it's not big enough for the hassle. (For all the fanfare of reddit accepting bitcoin, check the figures on how many people actually used it.)
Dropbox's premium product is aimed at businesses. Which means there are two lots of tax issues: those of the buyer and those of the seller. How many businesses have their accounts procedures already set up to use Bitcoin? How many are going to do that just to be able to purchase Dropbox? Why would they bother when they could just use the corporate Visa card and not make extra work for their accountant?
You talk of a misconception... Perhaps they noticed the votebox, did a little research and ended up on this subreddit. They glanced over the submission titles and decided that something that had the words "stolen", "scam", "feds", "seized" and "regulators" associated with it so often isn't something they want to associate their brand with right now.

I see. So QuantPlus is saying that many of the bids and asks available on MtGox are offered by the exchange itself, to push the price in a particular direction. And since MtGox has by far the largest market share, where its price goes, the others follow.
All that sounds very feasible, to be fair. Especially with so little regulation. I suppose it'd be much easier to manipulate the price of something so intangible, too. It's very hard to say what one bitcoin is worth, beyond "what someone will pay for it".
Thanks for the explanation. A few quick follow-up questions, if I may: if more traders = narrow spreads and lower short-term volatility, then it sounds like more traders is a good thing. People generally agree MtGox's monopoly is a bad thing... but if we have more traders, and they are distributed too thinly across other exchanges, won't there be insufficient volume anywhere to narrow spreads? 
Or is that just a software problem, which APIs + arbitrage could take care of?

Thanks. Here's a feedback sixpack:
1. The design made me think of space-military. You know, Battlestar Galactica and so on. Probably the wings, the grey/chrome and blood colorscheme, the stencil beta sign :)
2. The address amount did change instantly when I transferred funds, like you say.
3. I'm not sure about using the baht symbol for the currency. I would prefer "BTC", but that's perhaps just personal taste.
4. I think you could emphasise a bit more that it's supposed to be a temporary or disposable address. It's in the name, of course, but perhaps you could also highlight why someone might want to use it (e.g. out and about and need to receive a BTC payment; have no access to any of their addresses; want something quick they can get to later.)
5. I wouldn't anticipate ever using the address more than once, or leaving funds against it. So it would be nice to have a shortcut that populates the "Amount to send" field with the whole amount on the address, minus the transaction fee.
6. Not sure about the half 'n' half bolding of "RUSH**WALLET**" in the Warning box on the bottom left. Looks like a mistake...?

I think the problem may be partly about language. "Tip" is a loaded word. It's associated with giving another person extra money, beyond any agreed "cost" for a task or item, for good service. And in some cultures -- e.g N. America -- it goes much deeper: tipping is often so ubiquitous that people feel they are expected to tip, wages are structured with the expectation people will tip, and people who don't tip are thought of a certain way. (Mr Pink, I'm looking at you.)
So, some things to consider:  
1. What's the task or item other Reddit users provide?  
2. Was there already an agreed cost?  
3. What distinguishes good service? Saying something you agree with? Saying something you find funny?  
Now imagine the bot was called *bitcoinreward*, not bitcointip. Would that change how people use it? 
Now imagine the bot was called *bitcoindonate*. Would that change how people use it?
One more thing to consider (this I think is sometimes the closest analogy): when you drop some change into a busker's hat, are you "tipping" them, or something else?

Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu: *"Network neutrality is best defined as a network design principle. The idea is that a maximally useful public information network aspires to treat all content, sites, and platforms equally."*

Great comment. I'm interested in legal perspectives, too. More so in EU consumer rights laws (distance selling etc). Lots of "Buy X for Bitcoin" businesses spring up, and seem very vague on that front, perhaps unaware of the regulations.

Its market share has doubled in the past 6m (compare 6m with 24h and 3d here):

That's not strictly true, is it? If I knew nothing about bitcoin, and was then told I had to include a "transaction fee", however small, to send money to someone, I'd compare that to a wire transfer fee.
I'd be even more disappointed to find this out when same currency bank transfers in my country cost nothing and are as quick, if not quicker, as getting six confirmations from the blockchain. (They're certainly quicker than a zero-transaction-fee BTC transaction.)

You don't know that for certain. Perhaps people are here because they're curious about Bitcoin and want to learn more. Perhaps people are here because they are interested in Bitcoin, but don't necessarily "believe" in it; they are more eager to see the results of the experiment. Perhaps people are here because they are government regulators, or finance industry professionals, researching or keeping an eye on digital currencies


Is that a royal or papal "we"? Or has everyone here told you their (miraculously similar) thoughts?


No, we don't. Unless that direction is one to a place where different viewpoints and opinions can be put forward, shared, implemented, developed, discussed. 
Some bitcoin aficionados want to bring down central banks and avoid taxes. (No thank you.) Others want to acquire and keep it like a precious metal. (Not interested.) Others want to use it as a money transmitting service. (That *does* interest me, but not at the expense of dictating to people who want to use bitcoin in different ways.)

[I posted this comment on the other submission of this article.]
Back in 2011 HMRC made a statement saying people would only be liable for tax if they turned bitcoin into "regular cash".[1] 
As for recognising Bitcoin as a currency in itself, HMRC have replied to enquiries pretty recently saying they regard it as something more like a store voucher, rather than money, but that's more from a business viewpoint with regards to VAT etc.[2] And of course, how they categorise bitcoin might change.
As for UK exchanges, this [Bitcointalk thread]( has a lot of good discussion on Bitcoin's uptake in the UK.

I'd have very serious misgivings about using this service. 
Buying a 10 euro USB stick or alpaca socks off somebody for BTC is one thing. Booking a flight is another. 
As an EU citizen, I am protected by various travel consumer rights and this service is vague, to say the least, about how or if those rights would still be available to me.
If I take any flight that departs or arrives in the EU I am able to claim compensation in the case of [delay, cancellation and some other things]( Usually, this means talking to the airline directly in the first case, and, from past experience, they generally want to know where and how you bought the ticket.
Do I say I bought it online? If yes, am I likely to invite hassle by saying I didn't buy it in euros? What if I am promised a refund, but the price of bitcoin goes through a massive period of instability between the flight and my refund? Do I just lose out?
What if the airline is uncooperative and I am forced to contact my local country's consumer centre? Will they be understanding that I bought my flight via a website in a different country using a digital cryptocurrency? Will my refund have to be sent through the people I bought the ticket from? If yes, what guarantees have I got they would pass it on?
Of course, sometimes one person buys a plane ticket for another. A travel agent, for example, or a corporate travel booking company. But I can't see very much on the website that indicates whether the company is licensed or registered as either. That might make things smoother for me, but instead, it looks like I will have to explain that I paid funny money to someone I don't know, who isn't licensed, to do it all for me.
Talking of travel agents, I am also protected, as an EU citizen, by the [Package Travel Directive]( I get these rights if I buy "a package" that includes at least two from
* accommodation
* transport
* tourist services, like a ski pass or horseriding lessons
and the trip lasts for more than 24 hours.
The all4btc website says: *"We will organize and book everything for you."* To me, that sounds like offering a package. However, I'm not confident at all from the website that all4btc would be able to fulfill the rights listed at the above link about transferring a package, cancelling, or alternatives and reimbursements.
Again, there's nothing on the website to indicate I'm dealing with a licensed travel operator. This would no doubt make things more difficult for me if I had to go through a claims process via my local consumer centre. 
Or -- another big area of doubt or concern for me -- if I had to make any kind of claim via my travel insurance provider. They always want lots of information and look for any excuse not to pay out.
All in all: too many questions and doubts surrounding this for me.
On a more general note: Whenever "Buy X for Bitcoin!" websites and services spring up, I'm often struck by how fly-by-night they feel. I know a large portion of the Bitcoin community is anti-regulation, but not all regulation is bad. If you are offering a service where I would ordinarily be protected by consumer rights, I don't see why I should give them up just because I am using Bitcoin -- especially not when paying a % surcharge for supposed "convenience".

Well, according to the tiny sliver of the media that cares, the future adopters of Bitcoin will be the money launderers and criminals looking for somewhere to go now that Liberty Reserve has been shut down. How is that positive? The future adoption of bitcoin may well be zero.
Dropbox's whole point is that it "just works". It's simple. My grandma uses it to share photos with the rest of her family. She's 89. Dropbox's business tier is aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises looking for a similar experience: stuff that just works.
Draw a Venn diagram with those types of people and the number of people who have heard of Bitcoin, and know what it is, and are prepared to use it, and you will see one circle a lot larger than the other (clue: its not the Bitcoin one) and a very small overlap.
So, the media attention would probably not be that great among the market they are aiming for. Walk into the street and ask a hundred people at random if they know what bitcoin is. I bet the number who do will be lower than you think.


I think you're underestimating how much of a hassle it *would* be. A company of Dropbox's size and ambition -- they recently opened an EU headquarters -- isn't going to be able to sign up on the website like a mom 'n' pop store. They'll need and want a specific corporate SLA, which means contracts, negotiations, and lawyers checking over everything ... not to mention developers having to go over any technical and security impacts using the Bitpay API might have. Again, all for the sake of getting a tiny slice of a small pie.

A transaction is made up of input addresses (from) and output addresses (to). It says, essentially, send X BTC from here to there. The more addresses there are, the more data is being sent.
Say for example I want to give you 100 dollars. I have a hundred-dollar bill, so I just hand it to you.
Now imagine I want to give you 100 dollars, but instead of having a hundred-dollar bill handy, I have to get a few notes from my wallet, break open my two piggy banks, root down the back of the sofa, go through my coat pockets, and scrape some loose change from the key tray by the front door.
There is more work, or "data", in the second transaction, even though the amount is the same (100 dollars).
In practice, a Bitcoin wallet often has lots of addresses, each with a balance. I might have 1 BTC in my wallet, but spread over 6 or 7 different addresses. If I want to send 1 BTC to somebody, my client scoops balances out of the different addresses (inputs) and sends them to somebody else (the output).
In the example on the front page, the 10$ of BTC are spread out across dozens and dozens of addresses. Which means there is more data when the client scoops them together to send them to somebody else.
This is a somewhat simplified explanation (addresses don't actually have "balances") but I hope it makes things a bit clearer for you. Let me know if not :)

I think I must have seen too many blog posts dressed up as "open letters" recently. But anything that promotes awareness that at this stage it's very easy for bitcoin companies to appear more professional and smooth-running than they actually are is welcome. 
I liked how you focused on four areas: fees, lock-ins, delays and security.
Your MtGox example could have done with a bit more research and thinking through, though:


No. It isn't ... SEPA includes all the EU member states, not all of which have the euro, and some non-EU member states too. Five seconds on Wikipedia was all you needed there.




Well, then of course they have a withdrawal limit, if they are under anti-money laundering scrutiny.
Caveat emptor! is a good motto for Bitcoin users at the moment. You would hope that as the economy develops and competition grows businesses will have to raise their game to earn and keep the trust of customers.

But who gets to decide what's more important? What if I'm not a gamer? Like someone in a sister thread points out: things get simpler when you treat all packets the same.
At the moment it is ISPs and telcos who are pushing for the right to manage traffic. As net neutrality advocates point out, that's dangerous because many of them are media companies (e.g Comcast in the US; Sky, Virgin and now BT in the UK) who, given the opportunity, will prioritise traffic that does not impact their business models. Net neutrality would prevent them from offering whizzbang speeds on their own internet TV player service and slug-slow service on their competitors.
According to Tim Berners-Lee, net neutrality is: *"If I pay to connect to the Net with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or greater quality of service, then we can communicate at that level."* ([Source](

I'm sorry that it came off that I was disparaging your group's attendance. That wasn't what I intended. 
I meant the article -- and media representations more generally -- and the images about Bitcoin we get from it/them at this time.
I feel Bitcoin's growth would be aided by as representative a demographic as possible. I don't just mean gender -- it's also age, social status, different job types etc. I'm reminded of how in the early days of the web, or at least after it had moved from the nerds-science-labs-and-bedrooms stage, there were always local news stories about family businesses that had reaped the benefits of "going online". The local institutions got in on the act, too -- libraries, councils, schools etc. Then grandparents using Skype and Facebook to keep in touch with the family etc etc.
The more of those types of stories we hear about Bitcoin, the better its chance of surviving will be. I'm sure local meetups like yours will help there, in the same way things like "Get on the Net!" and "Grow Your Business Online!" groups did back in the day.

I also wanted to say that I think in-person meetups are a great idea for Bitcoin, because 
1. it's often easier to explain something in person, especially something complicated;
2. discussion is easier; and
3. seeing the humans involved with Bitcoin makes it so much more tangible.

Hi, author of the original [Kashmir Hill Test]( here.
Firstly, I wouldn't say half a dozen or so points is people "all over" something :)
The comment was half-flippant, to be honest, a play on the economic tests you sometimes read about in the news, and the idea that we couldn't call BTC (or other digicurrency) a success until Kashmir Hill herself has used it to buy coffee ... that even if there were millions of BTC turned over online every day for a year, until Kashmir Hill has got fresh coffee in return for it, it's just not viable :D
But I'm, er, glad it has provoked so much discussion. After reading this thread, and a [comment by Zomdifros]( I have come up with a revised version, copied here:
**The Kashmir Hill Test v2**  
"Neither Bitcoin, nor any other decentralised digital currency, can be deemed viable for everyday use in a given area until you can buy a cup of fresh coffee with it."

For non-UK readers, "Private Eye" is a British satirical magazine that lampoons public figures, politicians and institutions. 
A bit like "The Daily Show" or "The Colbert Report", it often exposes the hypocrisy and contradictions of politicians and media reporting of current affairs, but it's more controversial and sometimes a lot more offensive. It contains a fair bit of proper investigative journalism.
It's been going for more than 50 years and is well established in British current affairs. Its editor, Ian Hislop, is a team captain on the BBC comedy panel show "Have I Got News For You".

Nice domain name and interesting idea. If I may offer some constructive criticism on the email content:
1. It's a bit wordy. Many of the sentences are quite long. The whole second paragraph, for example.
2. It could do with a [BLUF]( (See questions below.)
3. What's the email subject going to be? The subject is very important.
4. I don't think saying "search for Bitcoin" will be enough. For a complete newcomer, that's going to be pretty overwhelming. One of the links on Google's first page has the words "legal gray area" and "money laundering". No thank you.
5. The email mentions links. Why not send them to your "How do I accept bitcoin?" page?
6. Wordpress and Namecheap should have capital letters.
7. Typo: "completley"
I would probably have the following questions if I was asked to accept Bitcoin and I knew nothing about it:
What is Bitcoin?  
Why should I accept it?  
What will it cost me?  
How do I set it up? Is it hard?  
At the moment the email certainly tries to answer those questions. I think it could do an even better job and increase response rates :)

OK, so we're dealing in hypotheticals.
You could import certain addresses into an Electrum wallet. But they would not replace the addresses that Electrum generates for you. They would sit alongside them. And as I said before, imported addresses cannot be recreated from the wallet seed.
Importing and exporting addresses are two sides of the same coin.
To import an address, you need its private key. How do you get the private key? You export it. 
In Electrum, you can export -- save -- the private keys of addresses into a .csv file. You can also right click on an individual address in the Receive tab (in Classic GUI), select Private Key, and copy the key manually to a text file or wherever.
Then, when you import an address into a new install of Electrum, or another client/wallet, it will ask you for the private key for the address.
But really, part of Electrum's beauty is you don't have to worry as much about exporting and importing and protecting private keys, and certain addresses and whatnot. Electrum creates addresses for you as you need them, and you can recreate the wallet with the seed.

"Taint" isn't relevant here.
"Converting pennies back" is where the loose change and 100 dollar bill analogy breaks down a little, so let me try another.
I own an orchard and I give away apples. Most of the time, I give away apples by the basket. Each basket has 25 apples. People come along, and they say, "I'd like a basket of apples, please", and I hand over a basket.
One day I decide to have an afternoon nap under a tree. I leave some local kids in charge. It's a nice day, and -- just my luck -- a lot of people stop by for apples. But none of them want a whole basket. They want only one apple, or two, or handful. And the kids, being kids, don't hand out the apples from the same basket. They just pick apples from the basket that was nearest to them at the time.
When I wake up, things are a bit of a mess. I've got half a dozen baskets of apples all with different amounts in them. There's 7 in one basket, 12 in another, 4 in a third, but not one basket has 25 apples. Apple madness.
Just as I'm shaking my head, and thinking I should close and go home, somebody else -- let's call her Alice -- comes looking for apples. Alice *does* want a whole basket. Which means I have to take apples from some of the half-empty baskets and put them in another, until I've got a whole basket to give to her.
Alice now has one basket of apples. She meets Bob later that day and gives it to him. But Bob doesn't really like apples. He decides to give the whole basket to Carol.
This is where things get a little more complicated than my earlier hundred-dollar bill explanation. A Bitcoin transaction is made up of an input and an output. An input isn't a reference to an address "balance", but to the previous transactions that make up the amount you want to send.
So, in the example above, when Alice gives the basket to Bob, the input includes all the occasions where I had to take apples from different baskets. Those previous transactions make up the amount: one basket. Lots of transactions, so quite a lot of data.
But when Bob gives the basket to Carol, the input is just "one basket from Alice to Bob". The amount of data is lower.
(Again, this is a simplified analogy, partly because it doesn't take into account the idea of change and spent/unspent amounts.)
The problem with collecting a few satoshi here and there from faucet sites is they give a low amount of BTC at a high data cost. 
Say you have an address, "1myBTCetc", that you regularly enter into those faucet sites. You do this twice a day for a month, and manage to scrape together a couple of dollars worth of BTC. When you then want to spend that amount, the transaction input will include all the transactions that it took (say, 31 x 2 = 62) to get those few dollars. Lots of data, so a higher fee.
(edit: tenses)
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:19:55
I agree to an extent. I find satoshis much easier to understand. Make sure the BTC amount has 8 decimal places and then move the decimal point all the way to the right. There's your amount in satoshis.
With the current value of BTC, though, it means many things are in the millions or tens of millions of satoshis. I don't think most people are comfortable with that. Most people are more used to currencies that divide into a hundred.
Perhaps one day 1 BTC will be worth enough in USD, EUR or whatever to make satoshis more appropriate. 
(As a name for currency I think "satoshi" sounds less clumsy and more sci-fi-cool than "bitcoin", too.)

Not *really* ... You can see  some stats about different servers (on or offline, ping etc) here:
Some servers have a higher pruning limit than others, which makes them better at restoring your transaction history if you need to rebuild the wallet from seed.


Electrum will pick a different one every time you open it. There is also an option to choose a random one if you get disconnected.


It gave you 5 addresses because you should never use the same address twice. Use a different address for each transaction. As you use the addresses in the wallet, Electrum will add more, so you will always have some spare.

"Heavily requested upon"? Is that before or after you filter out the votes from the monthly ballot-box stuffing that's co-ordinated here?
Saying they "should" do something makes you sound like you have a real sense of entitlement. Do you want Dropbox to accept bitcoin so you can use bitcoin to buy Dropbox, or do you want them to accept it because it would be a good feather in bitcoin's cap? 
What if I told you(.jpg) that maybe bitcoin isn't all its cracked up to be -- that at the least it's not suitable in every situation -- and that the reluctance of companies like Dropbox to drop everything and implement it is a sign of that?

Why, thank you timepad!
Cool bonus: I just thought how odd it was that sometimes in English people use "why" that way. After googling I ended up [here]( and learned that it's derived from Old English *hwaet*, which happens to be the first word in Beowulf.
