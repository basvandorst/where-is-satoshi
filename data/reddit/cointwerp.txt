This thread is scrutinizing the genesis of bitcoin's value.  Not how it grows/shrinks in response to standard supply/demand theory.
My suggestion was that the original pizza tx had to have been predicated on more than just the possibility that bitcoin (a random digital asset) will become a useable currency.  The receiver had to value something about those digital tokens beyond just the possibility that he could flip them in the future for another couple pizzas.
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:27:19
Edit:  Yes.  The problem is your implicit suggestion that the cost of running a node should stagnate/increase despite lowering costs of computer hardware.  Why should it?
If there were a valid answer to that, the next problem is why you are choosing to narrowly focus on only component of node operation cost?  (*And* in a misleading way that glosses over the fact that a nodes storage cost grow linearly in perpetuity regardless of the blocksize.)

Actually it does.  This is precisely what makes bitcoin difficult to acquire; and acquisition cost is antecedent to people attributing value to something (even if simply for its utility in trade for other things).
You're right in the sense that bitcoin's price is governed solely by the supply-demand relationship which cares only about the extent to which others value bitcoin.  But supply goes up significantly when there is little to no cost of acquisition.


This is similar to our counterintuitively poor understanding of large numbers.  For any modest size image and a reasonable colour palette, you wouldnt get very far...

Explain to me why someone would have seen sufficient value in bitcoin to accept 10k of them in exchange for a couple pizzas?  Was it because there were millions of users and bitcoin had somehow already proven itself to be useful in commerce?
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:11:16
Correct.  And your full node WILL treat this as a HF which is exactly what you want it to do to ensure the rules are being followed.
If you blindly trust the miners there is no point whatsoever in running a full node.  (And it wouldn't even be fair to call it a full node, you're really just providing free bandwitdth for the rogue mining cartel's CDN...)
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:55:22
Network effect certainly provides value too, but there is no chicken and egg conundrum -- first and foremost the network must be (and remain) decentralized to accrue some value.  Then and only then can it further distinguish itself with value derived from its network effect.
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:57:54
Bitcoin's price is not its value.  Market cap is what is relevant here.
Do you think the world would race to adopt a form of magic internet money with a total market cap of $1M?  The answer is 'no' because they've never even heard of it.

In one case you bend over and take whatever the mining majority gives you directly up the ass.  In the other case you ***validate*** everything the mining majority *tries* to give you and decide if it aligns to your preferences (declared and agreed to by all parties at the outset) or not; if it doesn't, you can exercise the full **power** of your individual autonomy to decide if you want to adjust your preferences or not.
If you can't comprehend the difference, then get fucked, sheep.  (Because you quite literally will.)

Decentralization is a prerequisite to bitcoin having any value at all.  Demand (i.e. buy/sell imbalance) is what establishes the magnitude of bitcoin's value.

Interesting article, but the author is kind of splitting hairs, no?
His newly defined 'autonomous immutable code' paradigm is actually something that already exists -- it's called hardware.  His suggestion that Apple somehow has more agency in the decision to implement a software-based tamper-proof system for the iCloud Key Vault than they do in implementing  a hardware-based tamper proof system in iOS devices themselves is a bit of a stretch.
Perhaps the mistake the author makes is assuming that the *only* reason for Apple to construct a tamper-proof system for the iCloud Key Vault is to thwart law enforcement agencies.  In actuality they *must* do it in order to be responsible in light of all the reasons the top comment points out.  Any remaining attack vector is equally likely to be exploited by the 'bad guys' as it is to serve useful to the 'good guys'...

That's because your analogy doesn't make sense.  In the case of a taxi, segwit would be more similar to adding a luggage trailer to each taxi.
The taxi driver with the trailer can offer a discount on his fares because he can fit 4 people in the car with luggage in the trailer.  The taxi driver without a trailer is only able to fit 2 people and their luggage in his car.

Great post, and great to see this kind of support voiced from such a large community!
However, to the original author (and others): please refrain from use of the word 'legacy' when referring to bitcoin.  It is unnecessary and only lends more credence than deserved to these hard forks that are attempting to appropriate the bitcoin name.
That is all.
Edit: corrected typo per CosmicHemorroid's catch below.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:05:18


CPFP and other solutions can help thwart this possibility.  Maybe that just becomes a different race condition, though...
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:28:14
Differentiation is necessary, yes, but not through concession of the bitcoin name.  People starting to refer to bitcoin as anything other than bitcoin (even 'legacy bitcoin') demarcates the success of these hard fork attacks.  See Ethereum as an example of this.
(That said, I totally agree with your original point.  Capital appears to be backing the right horse.)
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:48:36


No, we shouldn't.  Soecifically because it is **not** a business. 


This is a huge load of FUD.  Miners cannot go on strike, they can only quit.  If they choose to quit they will lose money.  If/when they quit there is no money lost by the rest of us.  There's no 'scabs to train' and no 'customers' to lose.

If you think that because the internet is decentralized that every service built on top of it is automatically decentralized too then you have some learning to do, son.


Sure, just like any of us could create and host an alternate version of paypal.  Given that possibility, what is bitcoin needed for?  Do you even know why you are here?
@_date: 2016-10-07 17:01:07
No, of course not.
I'm also not clear how what I said prompted you to generate that question.
I think there's been some misunderstanding in this thread amongst people who likely agree on most of these things. I think it may have started with the claim that blockstack aims to make a decentralized internet and the defensive position that the internet is already decentralized.  Neither are quite accurate.
@_date: 2016-10-06 21:07:26
I won't dispute that the incentives for most people to use decentralized services are weak, and that decentralized services will very likely continue thriving.  But there is an important distinction between services that are decentralized (or better, 'distributed'.  See:  ) and there being a selection of centralized services to choose from.  The internet is dentralized, yes, but that doesnt automatically make all services built on top decentralized.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:16:08
I would not accept.

Sorry, i guess i assumed that relating your flawed logic to bitcoin would aid your understanding because this is r/bitcoin.  My bad.
Distributed decentralized systems are all about adapting a more versatile paradigm of trust.  If you don't see how or why a shift in trust for a system like DNS towards an immutable distributed ledger is useful then there's not much I can say.

Yes, exactly.  Not sure what point you're trying to make..
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:12:42
No, the white paper does not define bitcoin.  It was an early (and very useful!) attempt to describe the concept.  The running code defines what bitcoin is.  And that clearly shows that my node will not accept a transaction that is not valid *even if* it were mined into a larger proof-of-work block.
If you're stuck on the apparent inconsistency with that ancient quote from the whitepaper, just imagine that every full node started to CPU-mine at some trivial hashrate.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:51:48
Classic rbtc -- quote a line without acknowledging the historic context and make a weak appeal to authority.
Of critical importance to your quote was the fact that at the time, nodes and miners were one and the same.  The language hadn't formed yet for discussing them as seperate entities.
If Satoshi were here today do you really believe that he would stand in support of a centralized group of miners dictating the validity of transactions because "that's how bitcoin was designed to work"?
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:49:37
No, I'm deviating from your [flawed] *interpretation of* the white paper.  This **does not** require any rule changes in the majority bitcoin software running today which actually defines what bitcoin is.  So no, there would not be a fork.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:05:13
Lol, whut?
I'm arguing for the employment of critical thinking and logic.  You're the one attempting to treat the whitepaper as a bible.
And try answering the question:


@_date: 2017-07-23 17:27:13
Let me break it down for you:
 * Satoshi wrote a white paper
 * Satoshi wrote bitcoin client software
 * You're claiming that satoshi's software 'forked off' from his own white paper because it didn't match the narrow interpretation of the white paper that you've chosen to make.
 * I'm claiming that bitcoin *is* the software and that the white paper is just a helpful description of the idea.  (I.e. in the event of any inconsistency between the two, bitcoin is what the software does.)
 * I'm claiming that your interpretation of the white paper is incorrect because it doesn't match what the software does.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:32:21
Sure thing, bud.
You realize that Satoshi wrote functional bitcoin software in addition to a white paper, right?
Carry on aggrandizing the white paper all you want; you're not fooling anyone.

Forget Jihan and whatever extent bitcoin mining today may or may not be centralized.
The question is hypothetical -- based on your understanding of the whitepaper, **if** mining were to become highly centralized (giving that entity majority control in the PoW 'voting system') do you think satoshi would say it's perfectly fine because thats the way he designed bitcoin to work?
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:26:44
