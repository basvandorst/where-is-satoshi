@_date: 2017-12-13 13:16:24
That's just speculation. If you found BTC somewhere when no one really knows what it is, would you keep it and not tell anyone? It's like when people are guilty of a crime they just don't say anything unless there is some kind of proof. I'd say go claim the laptop anyway and try to find that wallet.dat file. If there was any paperwork of his try to look for a paper wallet. If he won't give it up, involve the police. At this point if someone has stolen bitcoins police involvement is basically the same as any other stolen property. As a side note I am very sorry for you that you lost your brother. I hope that this all works out for you. I really do want to hear how the story concludes.

So sick of these economists who have zero clue about how cryptocurrencies work all of a sudden they are experts on them. They are good economists but they have no foundational understanding of cryptocurrencies and try to apply other economic theories or whatever to it, and it doesn't work. This guy thinks the supply is unlimited, that bitcoin isn't a store of value, that it's "hyperinflationary" - WTF. 
I always end up looking these people on twitter and tweeting to them but they never respond. I always offer the same thing - a debate. No one has taken me up on this so far.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:36:28
I almost fell into the same trap. I am convinced it was a social engineering/psychological campaign. I even saw some bullshit "letter" on pastebin about how BTC was going to be completely and utterly destroyed and brought to zero. Even so, I did not sell. It was really hard because I almost did, especially when I saw it going up past 1700-1800, etc. but I turned off the PC and saw the fallout the next day.

In theory, it can be hacked, however the odds of successfully hacking and taking down the bitcoin network are virtually impossible; this was part of the overall design and transparency in the software itself. Yes, it is software. It's not about the price. It's about Satoshi's vision of "the ability to send value to anyone, anywhere in the world, almost instantly." 
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:18:19
A bitcoin itself is technically free in the same way that dollars are free. It has value because you believe it does, therefore, you are willing to pay for it. Mining (solving calculations) isn't free, as it costs money in equipment and energy to calculate and generate bitcoins. Once a bitcoin exists, there are fees paid to miners per transaction, so sending it isn't free, either. The same rules apply to dollars, they aren't free to produce, and if I pay for something, dollars aren't destroyed, they just go to another wallet somewhere. But if I just have a dollar, I somehow had to earn that dollar, unless someone gives it to me. If someone sends me a bitcoin and I didn't pay for it, or the transaction fee, then it is technically something I got for free. Banks and coinbase have to make money somehow, so the days of doing things free/cheap are done.
@_date: 2019-03-27 11:28:53

Guys don't freak out. And don't blame Roger for the dip. Roger is a traitor and a hypocrite who is advocating a coin where he clearly has an advantage and illusion of control. As long as the core devs don't hard fork we are good. The real enemy here is Peter "the properties of Bitcoin have changed" Rizun. He's a "physicist and entrepreneur." IMO he doesn't know hit about how Bitcoin is supposed to work as wants a hard fork for the sole purpose of enriching himself and Jihan Wu. They want to control the network by claiming BU is "better" when it's not. It goes against all of what BTC was created for in the first place. It's kinda like communism in the 50's in the US. They will NEVER win. Buy on the dip. Fuck those ass clowns. Roger, Peter, and Jihan, fuck You. Roger would love to see you trade 40k BTC. I doubt he will do it. Watch that deal never happen.

It's hard to say why prices fluctuate the way they do, but BTC is a different market today than say 3 years ago, transactions keep increasing, but if a whale with a few thousand coins sells, it won't affect the market as much as it would when it was under a million in market cap, it's what like 18bn today or something.

Typically it means that other currencies are experiencing higher or lower valuation. If the trade volumes are constant and the price drops, likely a major currency is experiencing a valuation surge. Case in point, we saw an increase in Yuan evaluation and a drop in BTC value of about 15% overnight. A few months ago, the US Dollar was devalued a little bit so the BTC price increased. It's just one factor but it's always something to look at closely when there are sudden increase or decrease in BTC to fiat ratios.
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:56:40

Yes and no. Acquiring bitcoins in 2009-2012 was only possible by finding someone with them or using these shady money wire transfer orgs that need your personal data. And you've seen what happened with Gox, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. I think in order for truly mass adoption, there has to be some sort of legitimacy and regulation, and they, like other banks, need to make money off it. The main difference is that the Fed (a private bank, I might add) can print more money if it's needed and with Bitcoin you can't create more. Bitcoin is legitimate by nature, and rooted in something nearly impossible to break. So in the end I don't think it's a conspiracy but rather organizations like Coinbase help bring Bitcoin to the masses and increase the technology's legitimacy in the long run.

Regarding refunds, you need to have verbiage that clearly states if you pay in bitcoin, you will only be reimbursed in cash for the value you paid at the time of the transaction. You could even "borrow" said verbiage from Newegg.com, as they accept bitcoin but don't refund the bitcoin, just the fiat value at the time of transaction.

Yep, we're on the same page thats why i included the real review.

Second place is the first loser.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:13:18
All of the apps have the same complaints. So it's fake 5 star reviews with 1 star reviews all complaining about the same thing.

Well stated!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:19:09
You should read the reviews and complaints about it. They are all complaining about the same thing. which is the problem outlined.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:43:39
Looks like Roger is even writing his own 5 star reviews. How can we stop this madness? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:27:24
feels like they all worship Roger
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:29:19
Actually he could have been being truthful based on the information he had. He may have thought they were, but the problem with this is, Roger at that time was considered an expert in Bitcoin, and people who saw this video likely trusted his opinion. Based on this video, people would have said "okay, my funds are safe in Mt Gox- no worries" when in reality it was the opposite. To this day, Roger says "I never said they were solvent" when this video is basically him saying that they are without using those words. Roger was supposed to be a crypto expert and maybe even a consultant who got it wrong, and people lost money. The problem now is Roger is losing credibility with veteran bitcoiners because he is pushing BCH as "the real Bitcoin" when it is a fork/alt. He's doing well with noobs though. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:57:59
Yeah and I missed one of the best selling opportunities!
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:27:12
Lol, you are correct!
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:14:08
I am not trying to deter you, but it's a lot more complicated than you would think. I remember looking into this some time ago and it seemed like way more trouble than it was worth. It also doesn't necessarily mean that it will be profitable.  It's not just buy a machine and get a grocery store to host it for you... there's several hurdles you need to jump over before you're in business. Things like licenses, permits, registrations, etc. Someone mentioned a law firm that specializes in it and I would recommend starting there before you do anything. Also, if you have any guides that can simplify the process for the every day lamen like myself, that would be awesome if you could share.

At the end of the day, Ross is human. Just like us. Ross is a non-violent drug offender. Ross created a popular website that allowed peer-to-peer transactions for goods. Those goods just happen to be illegal under federal law. 
Yes he deserved a prison sentence for his culpability, and no he does not deserve a double life sentence.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:12:14
He probably needed the money and didn't HODL.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:04:46
At the time it was basically like "I might lose $100, so fuck that. I Don't need stupid internet "money'"
Also 2009-2010 the economy wasn't great. Most people I knew lived paycheck to paycheck. Spending $100 on BTC for me was like throwing away money.
PLUS BTC was not very easy to get. You didn't have Coinbase, you pretty much had to do a wire through western union to Mt Gox or BTCe. 
It's easy to say yeah looking back I should have bought and hodl'ed but the reality is no one would know that it would have been where it is today. Period.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:34:19
Literally no one else calls it "Bitcoin Core" except Roger. If people call it that, they are eviscerated by the community (looking at you, Shapeshift). 
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:01:17
No worries. Some people ask too how it is different from cash. With Cash, it's issued by the government and they can print more if needed. Bitcoin can only be mined until 21 million so it is a deflationary currency rather than inflationary (i.e. US Dollar)
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:31:14
You are receiving a block of serial numbers in your **wallet** which can be searched for on the **blockchain.** 
If you do not know those two terms above, please look them up as they relate to Bitcoin.
It is me directly sending you value, wherever you are, anywhere in the world, in a short period of time. We're talking minutes/hours, not days/weeks.
There is no third party involved, nor a bank. Direct value transaction from one person to another. 
BTW Bitcoin is many things, among them, it is a protocol. Another popular protocol is TCP/IP.

He could be but does it really matter?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:38:28
Yeah he is talking about bitcoin and not crooked exchanges but you are 100% correct.
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:28:16
Yep, until the next ban
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:14:53
Well he blocked me for calling him out on trolling the BTC community so I wouldn't know.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:43:04
Yeah that also took about 6 months, it wasn't over night home slice
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:12:52
Correct. We will see if anything comes of it, but I am glad someone at least called him out on it and filed a complaint.
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:04:38
I'm not pessimistic... China bans Bitcoin every once in a while, and the price tanks.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:07:15
His timing is interesting. It's almost like he waited until this exact time to make such comments.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:02:35
He also thinks that "cryptocurrencies are created out of thin air" which isn't true. I am pretty sure Chase created USD out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:28:19
Your response is exactly why it doesn't matter if he's satoshi or not. He could be, but we have no proof, and probably will never know who it is.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:42:24
This is normal. I would HODL if i were you but then again you might want to be cautious against people's trading advice you find on the internet. Personally I bought some alts.

@_date: 2017-09-13 20:13:07
It's related to stories yesterday. Jamie Dimon is the CEO of Chase and said Bitcoin was a fraud and then they put this up for blockchain project manager. I'm aware that blockchain =/= bitcoin but still it's a little convenient on the timing.

"Baseball Card Mark Cuban." What a genius. I really hate how he shat on BTC and all of crypto for SO LONG. almost an eternity. And then he wants to learn a few things about it. Next thing you know he does an ICO. Now all of a sudden he's an expert. Fuck this guy.

Lol, bro, I was trying to suggest people get in around the 200-300 range back in 2015 and everyone at my work, I mean everyone, laughed at me, then my boss told me I needed to get out at 1000 and cash out because it's going to crash and burn. Everyone was telling me I was crazy, but I kept persisting, kept putting money into it, and now I'm sitting pretty. I did manage to convince one person to buy me food on his credit card and i would reimburse him in BTC. Over time he eventually acquired about .6 BTC because prices were much lower at that time. Spoke to him recently and he started buying more. I no longer work there.

Check out Coinbase, you have to verify to get bigger limits and faster buy/sell times. I don't think it's required. It's typically an ACH transfer from your bank account. Can take 4-5 business days for noobs.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:41:37
doubt it. $5K by end of year tho
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:01:34

When you forget a password to your wallet, your Bitcoins are lost forever. Which makes everyone else a bit richer.

"I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network."
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:56:33
The only way to restore is by having the private keys. You're right, there is no way to tell. They wouldn't make it back into circulation if the person died without leaving their keys with someone to restore or lost the private key. Because those coins aren't accessible, it creates a greater demand for a shrinking supply. This is by design.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:28:55
I don't understand why people label it as mysterious either. It works just like cash, only you can pass it to others through the internet, each wallet and coin is tagged with a serial number, and you can trace the history all the way back to the beginning. In a way, it's more transparent than cash.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:57:44
I think he means $1bn IN BTC 
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:52:55
We are just hoping we get good gifts and not coal. :)
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:37:40
Yeah that really is it.
If you want the BCC tho i believe you'll have to get a wallet supporting that BCC (which is considered an alt)
The coins will have same serial numbers but are duplicated on both chains. 
So you can restore the coins then do whatever you want with them.
The idea is that the EXCHANGES won't do this, and control the private keys which do not allow you as the coin holder (on their exchange) to redeem your BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:44:29

Oh wow thanks for the detail. It's funny I never connected it but I assumed Coinbase just had a back log and THEY were taking a while, it didn't occur to me they were saying it was the BTC network. I just assumed t was them because on the blockchain there were all 0's and no transactions initiated. Thanks again for the info.

@_date: 2019-05-10 15:27:27
you're right, but at the same time, the community has trust in Binance. They've said it was external and internal methods. So it's probably a combination of phishing, API usage, and exploits. If they say the methods now, they could be:
1) incorrect
2) Could happen again
Plus the fact that it didn't even so much as dip that hard with $40m in BTC stolen from an exchange.... that's a feat in and of itself.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:35:46
