I think this is a troll post.  Nobody could be this serious.  If it is not, however, please don't do this without doing your due diligence.  If you need more advice, please visit and ask for reasons why not to do this.  It's always helpful to understand the opposing arguments for big investments, so I promise it's worth your time before you make the decision.

Wow, poor choice of name.  'Greyscale' is an affliction in the popular Game of Thrones series.  That'd be like calling your company Sith Enterprises in 1983

Why are they creating an exchange when Coinbase has already established one?  Are there ramifications for more than one exchange existing for a single currency/commodity?
