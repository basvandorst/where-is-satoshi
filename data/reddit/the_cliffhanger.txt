Я конечно не уверен, но по моему вполне логично со стороны государства Биткоин начать запрещать. Гайки и так закручивались последний год, так что я вполне допускаю, что это фактический запрет, а не предупреждение. Хотят пресечь на корню, пока народ еще думает, что это МММ.

Not yet, unfortunately, but you can try and install straight-server on your machine and in development mode it serves you a small demo client app on localhost:9696 (only runs in Dartium, because it's written in Dart - a temporary preference of mine) that can create orders, track their status through websockets and update the page accordingly.

that's like a 1000x increase, not bad.

Btw, I wanted to thank everyone who donated or is going to do it, you're awesome guys.

Government != average person. Where is the connection in your mind? Or are you, perhaps, assuming that a government works for the people and really cares about them?
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:42:23
Well, it might come as a surprise, but politicians, be it in Russia or elsewhere, don't care about the economy. They care about the status quo and keeping their wealth and themselves safe.

tl;dr translation:
1. Producing money surrogates is illegal according to the law (by surrogates I suppose they mean what is called counterfeiting in the US). This could mean mining is somewhat illegal, but I'm not sure.
2. Operations with Bitcoin are considered to be risky. This could mean banks ban on dealing with Bitcoin, much like in China.
So far, it is not a ban on selling/buying anything with Bitcoin, but it definitely has the potential to limit any Bitcoin exchange operations. As I suggested, the most recent news of Gref embracing Bitcoin doesn't matter because he doesn't have much influence on the actual policy anymore.
Update: it appears to be, after reading the Central Bank statement, **anyone who sells products and services for Bitcoin is to be considered a potential money launderer and terrorist aid**.

As a russian I find this video's narration very poor. It uses lots of terms and concepts that people who do not know how Bitcoin works wouldn't understand. It touches on those complicated subjects like double spending, but really doesn't explain what it really means and why is this a problem after all. Some of those terms are even used incorrectly, like "доверенный источник" - really? Wtf does that mean? I wouldn't know if I didn't know what you were talking about already.
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:00:07
Coming from the same people who say "let's keep politics out of Bitcoin". Am I supposed to keep politics out of Bitcoin by watching liberals talk about welfare? Or was it just that we should keep the wrong kind of politics (namely, libertarian ideas) out of Bitcoin?

Oops, I didn't bother to count the zeros, my bad.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:19:18
I think it is safe to say now that Russia is out for quite a while now. No business would risk accepting Bitcoin here.
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:27:35
Correct. To be fair, I used *money-tree* ruby library to handle BIP32 addresses and pubkeys. So it's not my invention. The point is that I wanted to have my own gateway and not depend on Coinbase or Bitpay, because they get progressively more intrusive when it comes to privacy. There's plenty of stuff going on there and I haven't seen anyone who bothered to implement a good opensource gateway that I can install and start using with my app right away.
There is no hosted demo (yet), but if you follow installation instructions, you should be able to easily install it on your machine and try it out.

Anyone knows a way to cash out bitcoins in Helsinki?
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:11:12
Beats a hell out of me.
But check out this phrase "148,8 г миллионов рублей". Reads like "148,8 gramms millions of rubles". Wtf? The article contains more syntax errors.
I think maybe the site was hacked or something like that.
Oh, yeah, here it is: "Работа сайта временно приостановлена." == "site is temporarily down". Guess they found out.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:39:12
Can you link to it? That wasn't in the article for sure.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:38:48
Russian here. Article is a complete and utter bullshit and fake. Every word of it smells bullshit.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:50:30
I know what it means and it is a wrong and misleading translation.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:26:19
Just to be clear, QIWI was essentially the last available option.

I'm going to spend them too, but I also need cash. Any Bitcoin ATMs in Helsinki?
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:21:56
1) Callbacks: yes. It sends a callback to 1 url of your choosing everytime the status of the order changes and it passes the info about the transaction along with some other info. It generally looks like this: 
2) No payment buttons and widgets for now, but I'm going to add this as a separate library that you can just as easily install and hook up to the straight-server.

If the FBI took the money, they will try to never ever reveal this, because that would damage the US's and agency reputation a lot and is going to be a shitstorm.
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:55:55
It's a screenshot because they require you to sign up with your phone number and name to access the payment page. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:07:16
For now, you can set it up on your own server following the instructions on Github. StraightAsia will allow me to pay a lot of attention to the presentation and demo, so that people can play with it easily before they decide to actually use it so I plan to put a lot of work into it. And it will also help make Straight accessible to non-technical people as well. We have exciting plans.
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:58:18
Can you be more specific as to how someone having less freedom in transferring his money is supposed to help me personally? Capital controls is an awful ugly shit they impose upon us Bitcoin was designed to avoid.
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:07:28
In my opinion, Gref is not very influential. He presents the more liberal wing of the russian polotical elite (liberal in Russia means more market oriented, less socialist and pro-regulation etc.) which is currently not favored by those on top. What I see is that Russia puts more and more restrictions and becomes less free. For example, just this week DHL and FedEx announced they have stopped delivering packages from Amazon and other  online stores to Russia because of the new strict demands from the customs (read: customs wants more money, uses govt to impose regulations and tariffs etc.)
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:26:47
You can try using Straight: 
It's an opensource Bitcoin payment gateway. At this point, you'd have to host it yourself though.
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:38:59
May I refer you to my post about deflation?

It's just one bank I've never heard of (interestingly, named "Russia Bank", not to confuse with the central bank or Russia). I can't imagine Visa/Mastercard blocking all Russian banks, as this would mean losing tons of profits.
So no, Russia isn't going to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, especially given the general line these days, which is to restrict freedoms of its citizens, specifically the ones who are young and lean west.
It seems to me that governments around the world are cracking down on freedoms these days, it's just that the crackdown is packaged differently. This whole Ukraine/Russia mess is very profitable to both west and Russia. West: "Russia's enemy, we must protect you, give us your tax money". Russia: "west is awful: gays/drugs etc, don't go there and stop liking everything western, spend your money at home". And people on both sides buy this bullshit, even though no one truly hates anyone.
Politicians and governments ARE the disease. Free market is the only true power that can bring together people who don't trust and don't like each other and help them cooperate. Bitcoin's gonna help with that, but please, oh please, stop counting on governments. No government will endorse it. They all hate the idea of people being free.

The only friendly regulation is no regulation
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:05:05
Yeah, in theory it would allow merchant to use his own node. I just don't have an adapter for it yet and there are a number of difficulties with that approach. Nothing that cannot be resolved, but it will take time to implement properly.
@_date: 2014-10-03 00:38:10
It won't. The point of Straight is to provide a payment gateway, not an exchange. I think, given enough time, if Straight becomes an established software, you can expect exchange to start working with it, providing plugins that would help merchants convert the coins automatically.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:40:06
Thanks, fixed that.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:07:47
Because if no one invests, then each unit of the money won't magically cost more! Deflation doesn't happen simply because nobody prints more. It happens because nobody prints more money AND new products and services are offered.
So, if an investor doesn't invest and everybody decides to hoard, no one wins. Then some eventually will invest. It is true that all those who don't invest will also benefit, but I would consider it a natural tax. A tax that doesn't need to be enforced by any entity and that works 100% of the time.
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:06:05
This might be my personal opinion, but Gref doesn't have much influence.

I'm sorry, I lost money on Gox and I have yet to meet a single person who also lost money there to come out and say "We want government regulation and protection". Nope. If not for the government and their bullshit procedures, I'd already have at least some of the money back.
Stop putting words in the mouths of the people you don't know. MtGox victims DO NOT want regulation.
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:05:24
You are right. But you also have to understand that we're trying to make money so that we can sponsor our development of the opensource project, which will be the base of StraightAsia. You can't just create quality software if you have no money.

If indeed they are relaunching soon, I cannot see how this will not quickly escalate into a bank run unless they do proof of reserves or partially disable withdrawals. Obviously, the second option would mean they were lying about their reserves in the first place.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:24:03
A "bank run" does not imply anything about how much reserves they have. They might have 200%, but so far as everybody decides to withdraw their money, the business is going to suffer. So, it doesn't matter whether they have reserves or not: until they prove it, people will not believe it.

@_date: 2015-01-26 03:53:09
I'll check your project, see what you've already done and there's gotta be something what we can work on together. We're currently working on the commercial, hosted version of Straight (of course, opensource will still be there), so there are a lot of exciting plans.
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:25:48
It's not the fiat side. It's trading. You simply won't be able to process trades at high frequency if you don't hold the money. People seem to think it's somehow magically possible, but it's not. It doesn't matter if you trade bitcoins for USD or sandwiches. Decentralization is simply not the answer for some problems.
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:37:10
We plan to cover some of the points you made in our opensource payment gateway called Straight ( There's a big announcement coming soon, so watch out for it.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:48:14
I hope to soon release contribution guidelines for developers. As for now, it would be super helpful if you could play with it locally and report all the errors/problems that you find to Github issues.
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:50:42
If you have to ask Obama or any other politician for privacy it means you're not going to get one. Similar to how if you have to trust with your private key to a third party, the bitcoins don't belong to you and can be taken away at any point.
You don't ask for privacy. You use encryption tools.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:17:29
I honestly don't get it. One small state made such a noise and now so many people want an update on a piece of legislation that cannot really change how Bitcoin works?

Your comment makes no sense whatsoever. Troll detected.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:08:24
No. Politics and innovation are incompatible things. Bitcoin was designed to bypass politics. Politicians embracing it are just trying to ride the wave of Bitcoin popularity. What do I need politicians for, again?

I'll be speaking about "Decentralized Share Issuing and Distribution" on the lightning sessions, come listen. The subject is very similar to what you guys are doing (I read about Sharecoins on bitcointalk). The talk is not about a product, but ideas that may be used in such a product, so you are welcome to borrow any. Or maybe correct me on some of the ideas you think are unusable.

It's not in Google Play because I wanted to support trial period and purchasing with bitcoins. Both cannot be done if you're in Google Play store.
It does support GBP.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:35:40
It's downloading ~14Gb of data in the blockchain. Depending on your connection, it may take some time. If you don't want to wait, use something like Electrum.

I can tell you this. If this thing takes off at least a little bit, I'll have some capital to start making it the best fucking trader's notification app ever.
Thank you for the links, I'll read em carefully.
@_date: 2013-05-08 11:51:27
Ok, I checked it. It looks like everything is fine. Low value was indeed lower than 108 on MtGox (for some reason, Bitcoinity shows a completely different data on low/high values). My guess is, you don't really want "low" or "high", you want "avg" (average) - "low" and "high" are the lowest and highest bids respectively.
@_date: 2013-05-08 12:37:58
An absolutely awesome idea, thank you. I most definitely will do that.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:13:28
Can you elaborate on your point about Dart? :)
@_date: 2013-08-18 20:48:15
Obviously, no, no other payment options are accepted. Otherwise, it'd be so much more difficult and expensive to launch this.
I think, the best way for organizers to handle this would be if they linked to the Cointicket event page from their website citing it as a payment option.

Be sure I will PM you in a couple of days.
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:37:00
Hm, I'm not sure what this means, I'm not a professional trader. If you can tell me what the hell this means, then I can most certainly think about implementing it.

Those are quite crappy bars, however they have a lot of locations. Now I might go there sometime.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:11:34
I actually almost don't need a backend, since all the trading is going to be done using websockets. Backend would simply be for signing up and saving settings (that is, until trading bots are introduced, but that's later). So I think I might just go with what I know best in the backend, that is Rails.
As for Javascript. Look. I've been working with it for years. It's not just that it doesn't have OOP. It doesn't have a lot of things usable languages have. I understand that a lot of talented and smart people are creating awesome things with it, but it doesn't mean the language is good. The language is half baked. I simply don't enjoy writing in it - it feels like a lot of effort for very little output.

Hi guys, I just wanted to share this app that I've made that wakes you up with an alarm or notification when a certain condition is satisfied. For instance you can say "When price goes down $10 in 10 minutes" and then go to sleep. It will wake you up in case this happens.
Was hoping for some feedback from btc traders. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:50:13
No beggers. Read the rules.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:52:41
I think it depends. For me personally, it's building a web interface that doesn't suck in terms of architecture. That is, how the GUI is programmed (not how it looks). For the most part, web still sucks at this. I've looked at different frameworks like Ember and Angular and my personal opinion is that they do things wrong. That and also the fact that Javascript is ugly, so each one of those frameworks has to invent its own version of OOP. So I'm building it in Dart and so far it actually feels easier and I quite enjoy it.
As for the "polished already", keep in mind - it's a prototype. It doesn't mean that I currently only have a photoshopped image of the app - I have quite a bit of code written already - but it's gonna take time for it work. Any ideas of improvement are thus welcomed.
@_date: 2013-05-12 06:03:36
Interesting. Can you give me a couple of hints as to what's it about? I mean, I'm not familiar with the "official" meaning of the term (if there is any), so there's a little bit of ambiguity in my mind about what it could mean.

Well, hopefully you'll be making more money then! Although I do realize my tiny little app is somewhat of an irritating pain in the ass that doesn't contribute to one's emotional stability, haha. But, I guess, one has to choose. Money come at a price.
