I mean in my eyes, it's slander but I realize this is just someone opinion and they're not saying what they know not to be true for the point of degrading it's image

Posting a few links to Forbes articles that cast Bitcoin in a negative light:

I agree. Just kind of wondering if it was an agenda. That question was the motivation for this post.

So basically the first few paragraphs establish a baseline of facts to convince the reader they know what they're talking about. By the last paragraph in that picture they're just describing their completely biased opinion about a resource that they clearly don't even understand. That's a common theme for the people who talk about Bitcoin in a negative way. Most of the people I see saying it will fail are either unintelligible writers working for big magazines like Forbes or old-school 70 year old investors who probably can't even use a computer without assistance.

You seem like the type of person who likes to make an argument wherever possible. My post was a question. Lol. Obviously someone shorting Bitcoin is going to write a negative article. Sorry, but your point isn't that hard to grasp and if you think it is then you, sir, are the ignorant one.

Ohh okay that makes sense. But yeah that's my point it's basically like a feeding frenzy at this point because of the spotlight the price decrease has put Bitcoin in.

Posted a bunch of links including the one for this article which is the first on the list

That last paragraph is essentially what I theorize to happen in roughly the same timeline you mapped out. See you in the future.

That was well articulated. I agree. Do you believe the general consensus among consumers will sway the future of Bitcoin one way or another or do you believe it's dependant primarily on larger entities like banks and governments?

If one of my posts gets even just one person to invest in Bitcoin then I've succeeded

What about user friendly apps that completely streamline the experience. Think airdropping bitcoin. All it takes is a few major Banks to get on board.

Whats your reasoning if you don't mind me asking? I believe that if enough of the common people hodl and begin introducing there own methods of transactions through Bitcoin (collectively we're smarter than corporations) if and when the world banks collapse we'll end up turning to crypto. The rich certainly will. Just look at the trading volume with something like bakkts or the CME. The winvklevoss' are literally having a tea party on investing and one of the main topics of discussion will be bitcoin. Then we have the halving coming in May right after that. Chinese banks are failing currently. Especially in a place like that where it seemed like crypto wasstarting to integrate with society. Until the minister realized Bitcoin would take away a lot of his and the influential people's power around him. I heard Taiwan and hongkong are doing a cross border collaboration with crypto but with all the riots in Hong Kong rn it really makes me worry about the state of the affairs in our entire world right now. Seems not one place in the world is loving in complete serenity and if they are they won't be for long did to the developing world

The people don't need to use those currencies though. Just think about it. If every civilian like you and me adopted Bitcoin we could completely separate ourselves from them this instant
