I was, then people got arrested and I was like "fuck that."

A lot of folks self-identify with the government. It's a sad condition with little hope for a cure.
@_date: 2015-12-15 23:23:24
It sounds like he voted his conscience regardless of the consequences.   Some people care about doing the right thing over "winning".
@_date: 2015-12-21 02:55:25
I'd watch your mailbox for a check in the amount contained in your account.
@_date: 2015-12-20 03:08:48
Banks are happy to hold your assets and charge you for the privilege regardless of your currency of choice. They close down Bitcoin-related accounts because the Feds make it difficult, non-profitable or impossible to keep them open. When every aspect of your business relies on approval from the federal government, you do not fuck around.
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:31:20
When we find out reason balls exist.
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:35:19
Your tears are worthless to the Greeks.
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:54:27
Lots of people by Arco gas.
@_date: 2014-09-25 07:46:04
They have the means and incentive to run most of the TOR exit nodes.  And they probably do.
@_date: 2014-09-20 06:42:40
But most likely the Postmaster General.
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:45:39
Imagine trying to run an ecommerce  company under the ever-expanding thumb of banking regulations. Fuck it, just split them.
@_date: 2014-09-27 02:57:26
Have you ever tried to etch shit into stone? Takes a long time.
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:48:05
Kind of like the cash in my wallet, but secured with a password and a backup copy at home.
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:15:31
I usually just threaten merchants with a swift kick in the balls.
@_date: 2014-10-16 19:42:11
Maybe, but an ATM without dollars is useless.
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:11:39
Self-identifying with the government. I think they teach that to our children in school.
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:16:38
So instead of swiping my credit card from my left pocket, I swipe my phone from my right pocket? That's so innovative.
@_date: 2014-09-20 06:41:12
Your address is public record. Remember then we had those things called phone books?
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:28:50
Old British dudes always sound so rational and intelligent. How can I not trust this guy?
@_date: 2014-11-24 14:56:09
Wow what do you do with all of that money?
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:35:42
Credit cards aren't that difficult to use. I don't see an advantage to putting them in my iCloud and then douching around with my phone when it's time to pay for lunch.
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:51:02
How is a government auction secret anyway?
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:03:12
IT departments have a lot of influence in the finance industry.
@_date: 2014-10-22 23:56:22
Only if they realize that it's gone.
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:37:35
This may have been true in the past, but there's been a dramatic shift in a lot of large financial institutions lately due to the prioritization of regulatory, risk and information security management. IT divisions with strong management will use those requirements to get whatever the hell they want, and the business needs take a back seat in many cases.

Funds deposited by customers in demand deposit accounts (such as checking accounts) would not be loaned out by the bank because it would be legally required to retain the full deposit to satisfy potential demand for payments. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 06:25:47
The first person to change their legal name to "Bitcoin" will never be able to open a bank account in the U.S.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:13:08
100% reserves? This kills the bank.
@_date: 2016-01-08 15:53:51
Banks are generally happy to do business with Bitcoin companies, but government regulations make it difficult and often impossible.
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:14:56
Your honesty has earned you one glove up the ass.
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:40:37
OP's web design is a throwback to the good 'ol days when content mattered. Don't change it, OP!
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:29:20
I only use node.js with angular webscale mongodb.
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:24:50
He's the CEO of Bitcom.
@_date: 2015-08-30 03:48:31
People laugh at me all the time. I'm still here.
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:45:01
What exactly do bitcoins secrete?
@_date: 2015-08-24 04:57:02
You sound like the commanding college professor that nobody listens to.
@_date: 2015-08-29 16:46:51
Maybe you should just anonymize them after you buy them.
@_date: 2015-08-29 02:20:52
Why would I send my money anywhere in the world? I only need it here.
@_date: 2015-08-29 02:24:18
It really needs a few hundred more people on the design committee. That will really make it pop.
@_date: 2015-08-24 04:57:49
Are you sure you're allowed to talk about this?
@_date: 2015-07-29 02:28:18
Yes, do all your private business at the local police station. What could go wrong?
@_date: 2015-08-30 03:50:19
My college experience has taught me that almost all professors were there because they could not hack it in the real world.
@_date: 2015-04-11 05:21:24
Huh? Many teachers take home over $100k per year here in California. I'm talking about elementary teachers, too.
@_date: 2015-04-10 06:17:05
Android runs everything? Shit I didn't even know.
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:19:27
Wow that is almost everything.
@_date: 2015-09-09 03:19:51
I've demo'd Bitcoin for law enforcement. By the time the local cops figure these forensics out, the statute of limitations will have expired twice.
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:22:56
I thought we were forbidden from discussing changes to Bitcoin in this forum.
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:29:28
Everything? Linux is cool but you're being crazy.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:57:29
I think they give one out for wedding drone strikes now.
@_date: 2015-03-12 06:42:41
What can you buy from Europe? Tight shorts and chocolates?
@_date: 2015-03-23 21:49:10
The depravity of authority knows no bounds.
@_date: 2015-03-22 05:46:18
How dare you. Satoshi is his real name and you will never take Bitcom away from him.
@_date: 2015-03-22 06:04:58
A lot of banks don't like dealing with potential money services businesses, only because it makes the Feds crawl up their ass.
@_date: 2015-03-22 06:02:20
Government has their hands up every bank's ass these days. Can't sneeze without getting audited and every moderate action requires government approval.
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:46:35
Stop bringing up MongoDb.
@_date: 2015-10-09 00:20:50
Do you ever wonder if the creator of Bitcoin is someone who knew you or worked with you, and took on your name as a pseudonym out of respect or humor?
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:42:58
I know a bunch of upper management banking IT guys in North Carolina (a major U.S. financial center.) They all fucking love NASCAR.
