Of course you are free to do what you want with your money, and you are also free to suffer the consequences of all your bad decisions regarding what to do with the money. You can't have freedom without responsibility. Choose not to invest and not to listen to sound financial advice and get burned. You're absolutely free to do so.
What you're not free to do is make bad decisions and complain about the consequences. I mean you're free as in nobody will jail you for it, but nobody will give fucks either, especially the government.

It makes me wonder if it's a cultural thing to think that you should be able to do whatever you want and be entitled to the same reward and punishment as everyone else. So in your world, whatever you do is rewarded. Doesn't matter if your choices are dumb or not. What matters is that you should be free to do whatever you want without consequences, right? I mean, I simply don't get it. Why on earth do you think you are entitled to that sort of freedom?
Of course it's get with it or get dying. Why should it be anything else? It has been like that for the whole human history. Imagine a Neanderthal thinking: yeah, I'm not feeling like hunting right now, I'll skip it today. I should be free to decide whether I'll go hunting or not. Nobody will force me to hunt. And then he dies together with his family. Well, go figure.
You ARE NOT entitled for mine or anyone else's sympathy if you make dumb choices. You HAVE responsibility, whether you like it or not. Imagining a pink world where anyone besides your close ones care that you are deluded with thinking you are entitled for anything, is just that, deluded. And they aren't making you any favors for apparently cuddling you into thinking that.

So your solution is to lay on the floor of the house crying about the FED while staying in it, right? Well, don't count on me having sympathy when you burn in the house while crying and doing nothing about it.
You could use some basic economics education as to why inflation happens even without FED \(you know, USA isn't the only country in the world, and isn't the only country with inflation\).
As you mention FED, I guess you're an American. So in the country where, despite all that 'system's fault' bullshit you weaklings spout on daily basis, 85&amp; of people in the bottom 15&amp; will move out of the bottom 15&amp; in 15 years, so there's more vertical mobility than anywhere in the world practically, your decision is to fucking cry about the system and sit on your couch doing nothing.
I would soo deport your crying asses to countries that have real problems and make you learn history and sociology so that you know what you had. I have no sympathy with entitled millenials \(I can assert this with great probability of success\) like you at all.

Fuck your strawman too, I'm not saying everyone is born with equal opportunity. I also say fuck you to all pussies who spend their lives being pussies and doing nothing about their situations. You have thinner bootstraps than the other guy, so fucking what?
You're dealt the cards you're dealt, you can't change that, you can't be reborn in other place, so you have two options. Crying and comparing yourself with guys who have it easier or try to do something with yourself. How is that even two options for someone with reason, I see only one viable option there. And it's completely beyond my comprehension how so many people choose the other option and choose to be so inert and weak. Like there isn't a million people who start from even worse situation than you but have a hundred times better mindset than you and make at least something out of their lives. I'm not saying you'll become Bill Gates if you think differently, maybe that's the problem, maybe you want to be Bill Gates or nothing, well you can't, most of us can't. So what? We can't all aim to the same goals, but aim YOUR best. So many people don't do THEIR best, just because someone else's best is better. Fuck that mentality, I have no sympathy for that bullshit. Get yourself together and do what you can do instead of endlessly crying how you're not in position to do anything. Fuck your excuses, life isn't always fair and it isn't going to cuddle you, but you can still do great things in your area of ability, no matter the situation you're in, and you ain't gonna convince me otherwise. 
I've seen enough disabled people doing more than whiny perfectly healthy people, both coming from the same socio\-economic background to know it's 99&amp; humbleness, dedicated and focused hard work that matters. And I don't give a shit about whiners, whine till your grave as far as I'm concerned. Bark to the moon how the system fucked you up, nobody will care expect your fellow whiners.

Okay, I'll start with my definitions of centralized and decentralized systems. Which by the way, aren't really mine, but what I believe is widely accepted, and in my opinion, rightfully so.
Centralized system is a system who's topology has a central entity that has a greater authority and powers than the other entities in the system. It's not mandatory for there to be just a single entity of that kind, it can be a group, but the group must work together. So a single point from where the power is propagated by force or other obliging means to the non-governing entities. The justification for such a definition is in the root of the word, centrum in Latin, center or pivot in English, so a vital point, like the middle of a circle.
[Decentralized systems]( are those in which individual entities don't have anything obliging them do behave in a certain way. There can still be some soft rules in the decentralized systems, it's just that nobody's vote is more stronger than the other one's, in deciding those rules. Rules are often necessary for ensuring there isn't chaos. The entities form a system because there was a need for the system and the system has a predefined purpose. Rules can be used to steer system's development in the direction of the original idea of the creation of the system. At least in theory. In practice, the individual entities can change the course of system's development, but what is important is that in that decision, no entity has a more important say than other.
Now, back to our post. 
From wiki on Academie francaise: 




Well there you have it. The code has to be compatible with each other for it to function in parallel for the same purpose. Those 138 versions follow certain basic rules that are **necessary** for the code to function together, not because some developer said, but because that's the nature of programming code. Some compatibility just **has** to exist for code to physically run side by side. If you change the basics (Bitcoin Cash) enough so that it just can't coexist with the other code (imagine changing the basics of language's grammar and sentence construction), you unfairly call that 'kicking out of the system' where actually they kicked themselves, just as you would kick yourself out of English if you completely disobey the basic rules of the language. **Unless of course** if your different rules are inherently better and the English speaking community praises you as the next Shakespeare and adopts your version of the language, then your version of the language might actually be called the English language.
Now what happened with Bitcoin Cash was like you took Danish language, made some changes and you got Swedish language. They are similar in certain ways, and they can understand each other to a degree, but are simply incompatible on some basic level (in Bitcoin Cash's case, it's the size of the blockchain's individual block, you just can't have 1MB blocks and 8MB blocks in the same blockchain, Bitcoin Cash decided 8MB is the way they want to go, and that's it).
Another point is that if the Bitcoin Cash's basic level changes were really inherently superior to the Bitcoin code, community would realize that and accept it as an important paradigm change and move on with it to the further development. But that hasn't happened yet, and they are now specializing in a different niche than Bitcoin, which is fine. For example, Esperanto language aims to be easy to learn, familiar if you know other European languages, and so on. They took what they thought was best from other languages, made some critical enough changes so that they can't be called English or French language and tried to do something in their niche. 
What is important is that there is no one entity that decides their success. Their success is measured by you and me equal, my preference of a certain language measures exactly the same as yours and everyone else's, just like my choice of Bitcoin changes I run on my computer measures exactly the same as somebody else's.
What's also important is that community decides which changes are meritorious. There is no language or Bitcoin without the community. And nobody's freedom is endangered because the majority decides what will be the rules of that specific system. Because the important thing is that you're free to make your own system and can measure the superiority of your changes with the adoption your changes make. So nobody enforces you to do a certain change, it's just for there to be progress, we cannot act childish and say 'Everyone wins, we'll accept everyone's changes, doesn't matter that they don't make sense'. But we also cannot enforce changes on someone that doesn't want it. So the majority vote, plus a chance to do your own changes independently and under the same conditions, is a nearly perfect governance model for me. I don't really see how it can be improved. If nothing good doesn't come up from that kind of governance then it's just that community doesn't deserve good things because the governance model gave them the ultimate power as a whole :P


So what about this, is Bitcoin decentralized or not?
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:20:29
Okay, I'll reply here, but cite the above too.


No. You think Bitcoin was created by a single individual or group who set it all in stone and we can't change it?




Yes, you finally get it!! Words become a part of the language when others start to use them (democratic vote)!! A code change becomes part of the Bitcoin when other nodes start to use it (here's the part where understanding the details would help a lot)!! So anyone can make a change (make up a new word/fork the Bitcoin code and change it) but you can't say it is part of the (language/code base) until enough (people/nodes) use it!! And the Bitcoin code is changing all the time as community agrees those changes are good.
Probably nobody will use 'ajbawb' except the creator, because that puzzle doesn't fit well enough, as you said. But how do we know that some other word like blooshingly fits or doesn't fit well? Surely you can find somebody that thinks that it fits well and somebody that thinks it doesn't, so what do you do? You ask a lot of people and infer your conclusion from the answers, a classic majority vote. Don't take 'ask' too literally, you can just observe whether the word caught up on a significant number of users. If there is not enough users of the word, there's this thing called dialect, your word can be part of the dialect (khm Bitcoin Cash khm) but which dialect or which parts of the different dialect is considered the official language is decided based on the usage of the parts, just like in Bitcoin network. Not formally counted like in elections, neither in language nor Bitcoin, usage itself **naturally** chooses the victor.


Let's not be passive aggressive, it has been a civilized conversation. The point I am trying to make in this exchange, maybe I should be more clear about it. It's that 1) you don't have a valid example of a decentralized system in a way that makes it different from Bitcoin and 2) you can't propose a decentralized solution to the Bitcoin problem (which I think is a moot thing to do as it's already decentralized) which takes me to the next point.


Although a nice philosophical digression, I will make my question clearer so you will have harder time to avoid it. You say Bitcoin governance is a centralized system. What solutions do you propose to make it decentralized? What kind of code governance system would please you?


You're mixing two things. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are part of the same, greater Cryptocurrency system, the same way different DNA is part of the greater body system. But if they are in fact different, so you ought to call them different names. You are as free to use Bitcoin Cash as you are to use Bitcoin, and if enough people use the Bitcoin Cash and nobody uses Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be 'kicked out of the system' :)
A cell 'decided' to be different, so why should we not call it different (mitochondrial DNA instead of regular DNA or whatever) and still allow it to be part of the broader system (Cryptocurrency system/body system). They have different function (as Bitcoin Cash has versus Bitcoin), so why not call them different. What you before referred to as 'kicking out of the system' seems to me just calling them different. Why is that bad? Bitcoin Cash can serve its purpose as a cash payment for smaller transactions, and Bitcoin can serve as a store of value. Some people will use the former, some the second. If one will have no users, it will die out, just like a type of DNA with no evolutionary purpose, with no value it gives to the system, will eventually be 'kicked out of the system'. Just like an old word that nobody uses anymore and is forgotten. If it gives value to the big enough part of the system (not necessarily a majority vote, but some kind of 'big enough' vote), it will remain the part of the system.

Notice how I asked for you to name a decentralized system **other than** the human body. Please name one.
Do you understand what "losing your Bitcoin" means? Do you know what a Bitcoin is? If you (or a group of people including you) make your own independent change, you will continue with your own blockchain. You can label the two blockchains whatever you like, Bitcoin or somehow else, the Bitcoin Cash supporters like to call themselves the real Bitcoin blockchain, and nobody can forbid them to do so. So the naming is a matter of semantic and is irrelevant in this discussion.


Both of these clauses are plainly wrong. You **can** make up your own rules, and you **don't** have to abide by the rules someone else made.
Explain **how** can a Bitcoin authority (out of those that you named) enforce a rule on me, how can they force me to run the code with their change implemented? Me or anyone else?? Do you understand that you have to answer this question so that you can make a parallel with government centralization because government has known mechanisms to enforce the changes in law, and it's true that you have to accept the changes if you don't want to face the consequences, if you don't accept any of the changes in Bitcoin network you face absolutely no consequences.
Please make sure you answer both of my questions. Naming a decentralized system other than the human body and how can someone enforce their rules on me.

Well that's where I can't follow your reasoning. I don't think you can say a cluster of things is a system based just on the fact that they have a common property. Like you can't say that everything that is of green color is part of the 'green system'.


I just think intention is a very important part of a system, and naturally behind intention there are conscious actors so there are usually implicit or explicit rules keeping the system together and making it what it is.


I played quite a bit with Game of Life at a younger age, but I don't think this makes your point. I don't see much chaos in cellular automata, they follow strictly defined rules carefully chosen and imposed by someone. The rules didn't evolve spontaneously or in a decentralized manner (by your definition). So I don't really understand your point here :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:26:46


I wasn't interested in biology beyond high school classes but isn't it that the genome is the same in every cell, it's just a small part of the DNA that is different in each cell and says which part of the genome should that specific cell utilize? You keep mentioning the DNAs of the different species in our bodies, I never heard of that.


Well in western world atleast, it's not unusual to change citizenship if you want? Not to mention move freely?


I'll check it out, thanks.


If there is no central control, can the cell choose the rules it wants to follow? Can it make up its own rules, radically different than what is usual in celullar automata systems? Or if it figures out entirely different rules, would you still consider them being under the cellular automata system? Or do they need to stay within certain boundaries of rules?
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:12:14
And who's to say which one of the two divided groups is Bitcoin, and which one is the fork? You don't get kicked out of a system, you're just making an elephant out of a fly, and frankly, I don't think you know about the topic as much as you seem confident about yourself.
There is no enforcing rules in open-source blockchains, and every node has an absolute free will to run software which it sees fit. There is no central authority which enforces anything, hence it is decentrelized as it gets.
You contradict yourself in a spectacular way. You say that centralized systems are under threat of dividing, but somehow think that everyone making their own rules is not dividing. On the contrary, centralized systems are very stable and change only when the central authority sees fit, and these changes are made by using the authority the central entity has, enforcing it on everyone else. Decentralized systems are more prone to dividing and change as they're not as rigorously controlled, and different groups of people have a tendency to disagree on stuff. But it's in system's interest to be stable so those groups of people make compromises and do forks in a non-anarchy way so as to not put the system's stability in danger.
You seem to only talk about the properties of centralized systems, the ones that you made up, and haven't really said who the central authority in this centralized system is. So, just one simple question. Who is it?
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:12:51


Oh, I just didn't understand you were including all the bacteria and stuff in the equation, well ok. I am aware of the cell specialization.


No, but hormones can influence the behavior of many cells. How hormones fit in your decentralized model?


But you can write computer code to simulate those models, so they can become systems. Not the point anyway.


This is what I was looking for. With those questions I asked I was trying to make a parallel with Bitcoin and maybe make you think about what those "laws of physics" and rule limitation in the Bitcoin system might be.
Just as there's some limitation of the rules that cell can have that classifies it in the cellular automata model, just as there's some limitation of the rules that sentence structure must have to be considered English or German, there's also some limitation in code compatibility that programming code must have to be considered Bitcoin.
There are some wiggling in all three systems, but there must be some boundaries. So they are not different in that aspect. There just ought to be some boundaries. And just like a cell that went crazy and made rules that do not conform to those boundaries doesn't fit in the cellular automata model anymore, and just like an individual that starts speaking with a sentence structure radically different doesn't speak English or German anymore, just like that, a node that runs fundamentally different code from Bitcoin's isn't part of the Bitcoin network **because** of those limitations, not because someone kicked them out. In all three systems, if you cross the limitations, nobody really kicks you out, you kicked yourself out by not staying within the boundaries, again, not the boundaries set by someone, but by the boundaries that are there because of the properties of the system itself.
I get your "free will is maybe not really free will" thing, I have similar observations regarding that, but the digression was irrelevant to this, I was just making a parallel so you can realize that even in what you call decentralized system, there are boundaries that you have to respect, else you're 'kicked out of the system'.

Right back at ya, my friend. The whole paragraph rings a bell.


No, and no. I really explained it in detail in my last post. Here's the part where I rethink if this makes sense. Because i repeat myself and say the same thing all over again, and you also say the same thing all over again. Two planets indeed.


When Microsoft guys release it, there is no vote, you either update the software or stay with the legacy version, but you surely can't dismiss the updated version and demand for other changes. When, what you consider Bitcoin coders, release something, if the community doesn't accept it, it is worth absolutely nothing, and Bitcoin stays the same. That's 12135 independent minds choosing to accept something or not. How's that for a decentralized decision making. And those 12135 can also propose a change with the same power as the Core group. Community equally votes for them by running their changes or not.


Sigh.. I just linked to the site that lists 138 versions of code that Bitcoin nodes run, right there in my previous post.


Wow.. this got me thinking.. you might just be the most stubborn troll I have ever encountered. You might just be a troll. Hm. If it's true I might reach the lowest point in faith in humanity.
Just in the case you are not, a lesson. A machine is a Linux machine if it runs a Linux kernel. Linux kernel development can't get any more centralized than it is. All the changes must be approved by one guy, Linus Torvalds. But as I'm typing this I realize you know all this and probably just enjoy arguing over nonsense like this.


Nope, not the distinctive property of centralized/decentralized system at all. Implying that reaching consensus makes a decentralized system centralized is nonsense. I should have noticed you're a troll when you went on philosophical rampage instead of answering the question straight.


A little lightmotive that periodically comes from you out of nowhere. Further troll confirmation.


The whole point of Bitcoin is decentralization to get away from controlling central authorities.
What part of this do you not get.
Should have looked at your history earlier. Indeed a troll. Thanks for wasting my time, you will surely be rewarded by the universe in some way.

I see this discussion has reached its end, so I think this will be my last post. We will have to agree to disagree.
I will briefly state the parts I have something to say about, but I don't think we can achieve any further insights discussing about them, our positions being this far apart.


This is an oxymoron. This is obvious enough that I don't know what else to say.


Pretty high horse you have there. I don't buy this "everyone's misguided but I know the way" rhetoric as an actual argument, so I see no useful information in that whole paragraph.
 &gt; But French is the only language I've ever heard of that has a government agency that officiates the language aggressively.
It's ok that you never head of them, but they can [still exist and be found if looked for](
Granted, you said government agencies and these include some private institutions but there are enough of them that are government bodies, including the one in my country (Croatia).


No, no, no aaaaand nope :) I already said that by that logic I can speak a mix of German and Russian words and say I'm speaking English. It's like you live in this pink world where everyone is right and you're afraid to tell them they're wrong. So anyone who says that they're speaking English, you say that they're right? Because participation is self-defined. Wow. Just wow. 


You know what you actually did? Step one: You made your own definition of the syntagm 'decentralized systems' that nobody else ever used. Step two: You declared the English language as decentralized system, not taking in account it's actual properties and your own definition of 'decentralized systems', you just said 'English is decentralized. Period. We'll worry about the properties of the English language being aligned with my definition of decentralized later.'. And then only in the Step three you merge the first two steps by making up its absurd properties like 'participation is self-defined', 'If they say they are speaking English, they are'.
You have to make up such ridiculous claims so that your first two premises somehow stay intact. But it's in the fact that so spectacularly false claims have to be made to support your premises that we see that the premises can't hold.


You just clearly have no idea why Bitcoin Cash can't be a Bitcoin subset. In my previous post I mentioned the block size and spent quite a lot of time and text to try to explain what happens when you change the basic rules of something, why code mechanics have their own intrinsic limitations, made parallels with language and Shakespeare. So you're gonna just have to inform yourself better here about the technical specifics, don't really want to say anything more here as it's a clear situation to the ones that want to learn about it.
So in conclusion, no real-world, large-scale system exists that really conforms to your definition of decentralized. You can always delude yourself that you're part of a system of which you are not, but I have no interest in researching or debating about that kind of views on system participation.
I wish you good luck in finding people that think about the world in the way you do, and bringing these kind of stuff to the wider attention of 'the media' or education institutions, if that's what you want to do. But I can't pretend that I think that those anarchistic, make-your-own-rules kind of views are anywhere near my picture of the world as I want to see it and as I think we should be striving for.
So yeah, maybe another post if you want to argue a specific or two, but we can slowly close this out. On a brighter note, I don't think I've ever had this long online discussion in an (somewhat :D) argumentative manner.

What if I say "This sfhasdj is ash ajbawb deliahsdjakashdjk!" Can I claim I still speak English, pretty please?
If you say blooshingly or sfhasdj and you made up the word, you don't speak English, period. You can CLAIM that you speak English, like Bitcoin Cash guys claim they are THE Bitcoin, but ad absurdum is not a legitimate tactic in any serious conversation. The reason why you think you will still speak English if you say blooshingly is that you think it's a minor enough change to the language, like a small variable change in code, and in real life, nobody can or will force you to stop using the word, so you think you still speak English if nobody is explicitly denying you the use of the word where as in code, your pull request has to be approved for the change to go in the code base. Well, in the first case you can delude yourself as much as you want, but that doesn't change the actual state of the things that you don't speak English.


I'd say studying things a little bit more in detail before giving such a strong opinion should be a standard. Judging the book by its covers can be dangerous and deceiving. Surely the studying of the details doesn't always change one's mind but the fact that it often does should be enough of a reason to do it. On a side note, I haven't really read anything like your opinion before, have you ran into/read somebody from the industry saying something along the lines you are saying? Can you link if you did?


I'd be happy to listen if you want to go from pointing out 'the problem', to suggesting a specific solution.


Stuff needs to be labeled with names so we can differentiate them, and it's my choice to think that Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. It's Bitcoin Cash team's choice to call themselves Bitcoin (because they think THEY are the real heirs of Satoshi's idea), and to call Bitcoin guys, 'Bitcoin Core'. The substance is that they are different, and community decides who to call Bitcoin. Like I said, I invite you to propose another system other than the current one.
EDIT: messed up the quotes

The comparison with governments is so misleading.
Can you change the law and live by your own laws? No.
Can you change the code and continue your own blockchain? Yes.
Okay, you named who you think the authorities in the Bitcoin network are. Now tell me **how** can they impose their changes of code on me like the government can impose the change of the law on me.
If nobody can enforce the changes on me, what else do you want from a system so it can be called decentralized? Can you please name another example of a decentralized system other than the human body, which I think you also have a misunderstanding about, I don't know what 10,000 other species's genes in my body do you refer to. And the cells don't make any decisions and don't have free will, I thought that was self evident. So, in summary, please **name** a decentralized system where individual entities can make decisions.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:09:31
So centralized systems are often divided, but in the systems where everyone is free to use their own rules there is no divide? Sure thing mate. You're not even consistent with yourself, and I urge you to check the definition of centralized/decentralized systems, and when you do, try to name the central authority in the Bitcoin network.

But if lets say 60% of nodes implement a change with which the other 40% don't agree, they can just branch in two blockchains. 
Nobody controls the 40% group, they can continue their separate chain with no control of the 60% group, right?
The runner of the node chooses which rules to follow, which blockchain to follow. How can "small group, or even individual" force other nodes to run the software that they don't want to run?
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:41:57


Any names I can do further research on, related to the decentralized systems?


I never totally agreed to that cause I see no system there. If you're talking non-digital currencies, the law of every modern state is very clear, you cannot change anything freely, there's usually one or two legally accepted currencies and that's it, so not decentralized by your definition. If you're talking digital currencies or, more precisely, cryptocurrency, then yes, I can see that it kind of fits your definition, you can make changes however you want, publish it and everything and you have another currency, it's just that I don't see a system per se there, it's just a collection of things that have similar function semantically.
I guess we could go more meta and say that I believe for something to be called a system it needs to be organized towards some purpose. If it needs to be organized, it has to have some rules, explicit or implicit that holds the system together, and makes system.. a system. If that's not fulfilled than it's just a chaotic cluster of things, and I would just not call that a system, and you would most probably call it a decentralized system :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:15:37
I don't even know anymore, does a reasonable and thoughtful discussion make sense if it still seems like we live on two separate planets. Try to believe me a little bit more on my next claims, and try to look up 'open source' and 'github' and stuff like that, cause.. I don't know you seem reasonable but I think you just lack information about the stuff..


Yes it did, Satoshi (an individual or a group, we'll never know) just applied slightly novel ideas and connected a few theories that stand on other theories that stand on.. well you get my point, the knowledge didn't come to his head by any magical means, so you could say that the knowledge necessary for Bitcoin to be born came from all kinds of math and cryptography areas theorized by people all around the world. Then he wrote some code as a Proof of Concept. Then he published the code AND STOPPED HAVING ANY POWER OVER HOW IT WILL BE USED.


No, they are **not**. I mean, now we're arguing over easily verifiable facts.


No you **don't**. It's just a possibility that nobody else will use your rules just as it's a possibility that nobody else will use your made up word. And maybe they will use your rules just as maybe they will use your word.


No we are not. Maybe some pigeon version of English, but you can't make stuff up and still speak the same language. You can surely delude yourself that you're speaking it, but try using your word in a scientific paper, on in a job interview, and see how that goes without 'punishment'.


What do you even mean the whole time by 'being kicked out'. Nobody will put you in jail, you can use your word however you want, just as you can play with your version of blockchain however long you want. Do you understand the fact that you can have separate versions of blockchain running, it's just a matter of number of people accepting that change and joining your blockchain as is a matter of number of people using your word.


Well if English speakers can't comprehend you then, surprise, surprise, you're not speaking English. Nobody will kick them in their ass, but just a little few deluded people will think they still speak English.


Yes, there is. Not a formal one for sure, but anything not accepted by general public is considered a dialect.


I can realize that you can speak English if you want, but also that you use some word that are simply NOT part of the English language.


Oh nobody is stopping you in anything, not by force. It's just clear to a sane person that you use words that are not part of the English language. So other words -&gt; yes, part of the language, a sentence with that strange word -&gt; not part of the language, you as an English speaker -&gt; well sure but not in that sentence.


Sure I'm at a virtual gunpoint the whole time.


No, they don't. I feel repetitive. People choose themselves what code to run, what rules to follow, hence a decentralized code governance. When you have Microsoft Office (or Skype, Visual Studio, whatever) published by Microsoft, changes published only by Microsoft, code available only to Microsoft, that's a centralized code governance. When you can download the whole Bitcoin code, make any changes you want, publish any changes you want, post the code wherever you want so anybody in the whole wide world can run your version, when you yourself can run whatever version you want, that's as free as it gets, and as decentralized decision making as it gets. You can't propose a more decentralized system of code governance because there is no one.


No it ain't, I mean, this is just absurd. Just because nobody cares to formally forbid your new word or nobody cares to do anything about it, doesn't mean it somehow becomes the part of the English language. Nobody cares for my changes on my forked repository of Bitcoin either, doesn't mean I'm kicked out of the system, it's just that my changes don't have the quality to be widely accepted, just as a word doesn't have a quality to be widely accepted. It's not a childlish, 'everybody wins, everybody can participate' game. You are vetted by the community, in language as well as in the code, and if your change does not get accepted by some reasonably large population and you are still deluded that it's part of the system, then you're just that, deluded.


Again, simply not true. By that logic, every word ever is part of the English language, as well a part of the Russian language, and every language there is. The only thing relevant, is USAGE.


Yes, all nodes in Bitcoin are the same. Every friggin node has the power to make up any rule it wants. I don't understand what's so hard to comprehend. Every. node. can run. whatever. it wants. As a matter of fact, look at these 12135 nodes (at the time of writing) spread out over the world:  And every node having the exactly same right to influence Bitcoin decisions as any other. You can run a full node too and have a say in Bitcoin governance, here's how:  There are more tutorials available on the net. There are even multiple versions (138 of them listed here:  of Bitcoin code that are compatible with each other and you can choose which one to run or choose to run your own, modified version.


Fine, then make a TurilCoin or whatever, make something decentralized. You don't have to actually make it, just picture a decentralized code governance model and explain it to me. Please.


Some governments (most) would disagree with you here.


Oh, but there are. One of the biggest Bitcoin's obstacles is regulation and is one of the reason its price in dollars plummeted the last couple of months. There are a couple of countries already making usage of Bitcoin illegal, so yeah, it can be kicked out: 
EDIT: Maybe I found a parallel that I invite you to challenge and tell me the difference between a language and Bitcoin. Okay, so making up a word would be equivalent of making a change in the Bitcoin code. Using that word would be running your node with the modified version. Your word getting traction in usage would be an increased number of nodes running your (hopefully) improved version of Bitcoin code. Word used by a reasonably large number of people (perhaps a majority) for some time and essentially entering the language would be a large number of nodes (perhaps a majority) running your version of code and essentially becoming the Bitcoin. What you have in mind when you think Bitcoin is centralized is some developers or whoever having to accept your changes and put them in the code base. Equivalent would be some academics having to accept your word into the next edition of some well known dictionary. But neither of these situations doesn't have to happen for the word to be part of the language/change to be part of the Bitcoin. The developers/the academics are just a group of people that we trust a little bit more than the average Joe that they won't make stupid mistakes because they have experience in the area. But they are not the final authority over what is English language/Bitcoin. People using the words/nodes running the code is what determines what a language/Bitcoin is. Please name a difference based on this example, between the degree of centralization of a language and Bitcoin.

How can anyone let themselves speak or write these kind of sentences: "This is stupid. If you don't agree with me, you're stupid."
Why? Why would anyone on this earth write such a sentence? No substance, no point, no counter-argument being made, absolutely no contribution to the discussion. And why it's so common I really can't wrap my head around it.
Do you do that in real life too? When you disagree with someone you get up and yell "All who thinks like this man about this particular topic is a stupid person and doesn't know nothing."? Would you see how ridiculous you seem if someone would do that in real life in front of you?

Bitmain would develop ASICs for all hashes used and just employ the ome currently valid? I don't understand how your proposition makes the situation any different.

But if I make up a new word, I am surely kicked out of the old language right? I can no longer consider myself speaking the old language and I have to accept the fact that I'm speaking a new language. Wow, doesn't that remind us of something?


Yeah, I wasn't aware of this fact till now, but now I understand the confusion. I no longer see the point of this conversation as I can only point you to the relevant sources so you can learn the matter.


Yeah, the whole point of decentralized ledger. Versus centralized ledgers like in banks where one (centralized) malicious change of state would have the final word as there's only one (hence centralized) point of authority.


I see nobody "rejecting" the Bitcoin Cash code.
