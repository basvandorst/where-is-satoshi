Does this make bitcoin more valuable If 10.5m were missing?

If i had enough money to buy 997 BTC then i would save up and buy a cool 1,000 because if i can afford to spare €11,600,133.567 then i can afford to spare an additional €35k. May as well buy an extra 0.1 for any fees I might need so it stays relatively close to 1k BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:11:21
Bitcoin would win 100%

Don’t bother. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:22:43
How do you do that?
@_date: 2018-10-05 01:33:11
An exchange is not a safe place for any amount of funds. Buy it then transfer it somewhere safe! trezor, ledger or bitbox is a cheap and reliable solution.
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:19:48
Spot on there .

You don’t have to make an account w/ token blender you do now for some reason w/ shapeshift.io i think it just means it gets the rates from ShapeShift.

I really like Kraken i got tier 3 verified within a couple of hours. I also like their trading interface and their variety of coins especially i can pay in euro via SEPA transfer i wish they would support a few more though.

Is that number the amount of bitcoin you have?
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:52:35
Since 2017. Found out about it in 2013 idk why I didn’t buy I guess I just found out about Silk Road and tor browser but thought nothing of it.

This is like those tokens you can buy at theme parks don’t have any real life value they’re just a waste of real money.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:29:19
If they charge $2 just for looking at your balance, how much would they charge for buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:27:37
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-13 06:39:41

True but only w/ premium, you could also enable 2FA on the password manager app. It’s also open source.

Isn’t there a way to prove that he is/isn’t the creator of bitcoin?
If he was the creator then wouldn’t he have the first bitcoin ever mined, sent and received? He could just prove it cryptographically right?
Obviously I know he isn’t but I don’t want to get sued.
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:43:59
I make it up and make a note of it so even friends and family can’t get in.
Also 2FA.
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:50:19
So use an authenticator app or hardware authenticator like

Park it on r/trezor or r/ledgerwallet

Can someone help me with the maths? I suck at it. If 1₿ is a million how much is my 0.04BTC worth? Is there a way to work out how much my hodling would be not matter the price like an equation i can reuse?

Last time i checked maths and English are two completely different subjects. Is it not possible for me to be good at one and bad at the other?

I pay £10/month get unlimited texts and calls 3GB of data and if i run out before the month is up they give me an extra 1GB until it renews.
I can also just not pay it if I don’t have enough money or decide to switch and I won’t get charged to leave or have to call customer services. Just turn off recurring payments and that’s it use what i have for the rest of the month then switch to whatever i want.
I wish ISPs did this.
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:34:02
How do I do that? I'm new to running nodes.

So (current price) x holding = value of holding?
edit: What if I bought different amounts at different times? like once in january thrice in july and thrice again in august? How can I work out how much my holding is worth?
