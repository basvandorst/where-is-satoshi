That can be said about literally everything that has yet to happen though. Things can still become statistically more likely to happen while not happening yet. Like someone who smokes saying "They said this causes cancer! They were wrong." Maybe for that individual but statistically speaking, smoking increases your odds of cancer. So just because uncle joe smoked his whole life and doesnt have cancer doesnt mean there isnt a broader correlation. We shouldn't operate society on the hopes that our system will be a statistical anomaly.

Everyone knows that the best way to make sure criminals don't abuse something is to make it illegal. That way the criminals will be afraid to use it for illegal things because it would be illegal to use it for their criminal activities.

Vapir NO2 has been my workhorse for about a year now and I have had zero complaints or problems with it. I would recommend it to anyone. It's quite inexpensive too.

I wasn't doubting what you were saying. My post was a joke. If they implement bit coin into AdSense payments I would be a happy camper!

You know a good way to reduce money laundering? Force people to use cash to pay for local bitcoin. Perfect plan.

In Texas it's just called the plan.

I was being facetious. What you said is how I was thinking too. Dumb policy.

Basing this off how Google has done things in the past, they are probably working on some sort of Googlecoin that will then become the most widely used currency in the world.
