You know how you still need transaction confirmations when u send btc p2p? There's a small fee that's taken out for the miners that help the confirmations go thru.... There will always be a need for miners even when btc "runs out"

I understand they are needed but they are not needed in a lot of other aspects as well. Taking away that power they hold over us is one of the reasons btc was even created.... at least that's what I always thought when I learned about it like 5 years ago lol

The whole point of btc is so we don't need banks...? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:13:38
So if I hodl from when btc first became a thing I wouldn't be rich right? Lol

You really don't think people say that to others when they chose to invest in a stock when it's high cuz people are amping it the same way? I mean people are dicks regardless everywhere.

So your saying if you have a lot of money you should know the price of something before your even told? That's retarded
