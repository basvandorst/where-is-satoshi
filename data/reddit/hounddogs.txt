It’s possible I’m retarded and perhaps a bit drunk in addition, but by my calculation if BTC were to replace USD the BTC price would be $400,000,000 per btc meaning you and your wife would essentially be rich.

I think a case can be made that even many bitcoin people don’t know what’s going on, however it seems clear that Bitcoin critics do t have the slightest fucking clue. I seriously don’t even consider their opinion any more.

Considering that I think less and less of Zuckerberg every day, it’s like poetic justice.

All of the people who are libertarian minded who stuck to their guns in the beginning and weren’t deterred.  You were stronger than me and you were wiser than me, but I made a choice and trusted you and I’m so thankful you were proven right....so far.

Definitely the rule.  IMO, as long as BTC stays cryptographically secure it will likley continue to be a store of value that will increase over time.  I invest so little, I think of it as a savings account I'm going to use when I'm 60.

Can someone link me to an unbiased explanation of what Bitcoin Cash is and why it’s supposed to be different? If you’d like to give me your analysis/opinion I’d like to hear that as well.

I swear to Christ, you internet people need to start taking things more seriously.

It’s just part of the ride. People need to relax. We did everything in our power to warn people this was an absurdly unpredictable market and not to invest more than they could afford to lose. Even if they didn’t take that advice I still think theyll be fine if hey just have patience. 
As long as the crypto is strong, BTC will be fine.

Crypto news is a great website if you don’t like the topics or discussion here.

The shitposting in this place could go pro.

I’m not sure if you’re being sarcastic but it’s not that anonymous. As soon as someone tries to spend that BTC it will begin to leave a trail. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:46:16
It seems like this kind of theft would be easy to track. How could they NOT get caught if they try to spend it?

This is insane.  There's no way I'm buying right now.  My father was at the house yesterday and said something about Bitcoin going nanners....this news would otherwise never have reached his ears.  It's getting mainstream attention and with that comes investment and panic.  
When the price drops all the normies who took a chance are going to shit a chicken and try to mitigate their losses not knowing just how volatile crypto is.  All part of the growth process but it's hard for me to wrap my head around buying at these prices.

For the love of god can we please also support decentralized social media (something like Akasha) so we can actually guarantee uncensored speech?
This is a magnificent opportunity. Thank you!

It won’t. Not for me anyway. A few more weeks like this and I’ll be at the strip club with one of those dollar bill shooters sitting on a Yeti full of Dom. I can only take so much before I snap.

The Federal Reserve is not an answer, they just don’t realize it. You can’t put dollar bills in your gas tank or eat them. They’re fucking worthless.
Cryptography &gt; Federal Reserve as a store of value. That’s our case. We’ve chosen our horse.

She’s probably a goddamn billionaire who sold a bag of weed to someone for 50,000 BtC on deep web 3 days after it came out. Our piddly little donations won’t mean much.
