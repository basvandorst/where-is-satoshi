My "unbacked FUD" might just have more USD backing than Tether!


Enlighten me then. How do you know for certain that it is 1:1 backed by a reserve of USD?

Not at all. I think you're confusing two separate points because you glossed over what I was saying.
There is wash trading. The market cap does not reflect what most people think it does. Those are two separate points.

You have no idea how much money is actually in bitcoin. Market cap is almost meaningless. Trades can be spoofed. The allegation is that some people are trading things they feel are valuable for what might very well be car wash tokens.
I know you emotionally want it to be true that there's zillions flying around every day and that this is a drop in the bucket, but that is probably not the case.
Why is nobody allowed to doubt or be uncertain?

You seem to be taking this very personally. How much money are you down on bitcoin?

If it's true why did you delete your comments above?

Calling someone salty because you don't like/agree with them is dumb. I doubt I made your night. If I did, that's sad.

.. wow. So, not the automobile, the transistor, the printing press, the vaccine, actual currency which already existed... but Bitcoin?
It's hard to have a real conversation with a zealot, but I think tulip bulbs is a reasonable comparison. Rapid appreciation doesn't necessarily mean something is here to stay or even essentially more useful than alternatives.  Snapchat had roughly half the market cap bitcoin has at one point. Is Snapchat revolutionary?
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:59:45
One can argue all one wants, the market has looked over all arguments and is valuing one tulip bulb at over $4,000.

So the price is unimportant and this revolutionary "best ever" technology isn't here to stay?
Do you even listen to yourself?

He got caught using a demo account on his stream. He then wrote a shitty Amazon book about how none of it was true and how he's a fry cook or something. Nothing he has ever said/done involved real money.
It makes sense because he has only a basic understanding of futures, yet is trying to tell everyone how they work.
OP is a fucking world class retard.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:32:20
It's because the OP is a notorious charlatan moron who got caught faking equity trades with a demo account for attention while drinking champagne out of a straw through a wolf mask. He's actually a fry cook at McDonalds or something. He likely has no BTC, no futures account, and no clue.
I'm being entirely serious about that wolf mask thing too.

We banished him, he's apparently your problem now. Professional trader my ass.

The worst case is you're long/short a contract and it goes limit up/down when the market opens back up. Good way to lose a few thousand instantly. Who knows what the exposure will be on each contract.
It should be noted the OP is a notorious fraud that got caught using a demo account while live streaming fake trades for attention. There's absolutely nothing professional about him. He admits in his book that he's a fry cook at mcdonalds or something.

This may be the dumbest thing I've ever read.
I knew I was in for a treat with a start like "I have seen things. Don't ask me how. My dreams can be cryptic."
