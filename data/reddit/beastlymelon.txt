my point was someone in their 20s can come back from losing their savings and can take a big bet. With a reduction in risk comes reduction in reward.This is why we're here. Crypto has seen bigger returns in many cases over time than anything short of what an accredited investor can achieve. 2018 will be the year where crypto either dies or it revolutionizes the financial industry.

If you want a serious investment that will guarantee you will be able to retire comfortably, seriously will have better answers. 
Their wiki recommends maxing out matching 401k contributions, and opening a roth ira for people with modest incomes divided against foreign and domestic stocks and bonds.Vanguard is well regarded.  Roth's  (limit $5500 year max) have interest taxed yearly and carry no penalty for withdraws (i believe).

if you're 20 put it all on black.You don't know where it's going in a year and neither does anyone else. Don't daytrade. otherwise don't put more than 30% in crypto.
