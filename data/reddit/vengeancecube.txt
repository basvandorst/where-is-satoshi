I WILL buy trax for bitcoins when the time comes!!!

I buy food I couldn't otherwise afford for my pregnant wife. It's hard to budget for food when those sudden cravings and aversions hit and you need to change the menu quickly!

And the mag strip...

Does anyone know somewhere to buy a 3D printer like the Makerbot for bitcoin today? Adafruit isn't in stock. =(
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:23:46
I'd be so very happy to get some!
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:21:14
This is really awesome. I'd love to accept bitcoin for my IT services but the people I service are usually calling me because they forgot how to turn their computer on...
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:14:02
Thanks. It wasn't much. Only 6+ BTC but it's all I had. I've been following the news and everything about Gox has been sounding bad. Decided to try and pull my coins out but I have to be verified first. I just moved so I'm lacking the documentation at the moment. Really believe in BTC and wanted to start doing something with them other than hold on to them. Hoping you're right and it just turns out to be a glitch.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:29:35
Seriously, wtf WAS THAT?
@_date: 2013-03-05 13:09:42
Oh awesome! Thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:58:13
I'd try it but they're always asking way WAY above rational prices. As of right now the price stands at around $719 on Gox and (a more rational) $585 on bitstamp. The people near me are all asking $780+ with one asking over $1000 per BTC!
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:48:47
That, sir, is a sandwich.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:06:34
Unfortunately the money is still gone. Still no history, still no bitcoins. Support has not answered the issue yet. They did at least assign someone to it supposedly. That person just asked for the account number in question (they don't know from my account?). Anyway, probably be another couple days before I hear from them about how I never had any money with them or something and my bitcoins will just be gone forever while Gox laughs all the way to the bank.

Everyone needs to stop looking at the short term. This graph is a beautiful example of what people have been saying all along. In a few months bitcoin will continue it's upward trend toward $60. Look at it this way, long term it never really was worth $260. Do I wish I sold at $260? Sure. Would have been nice to gain like that but long term, I've only lost what I lost to a couple of panic sells. Bitcoins have a future. That future's in a few years. It will take people like us to make it happen.

Corozal is an ok town. There's some nice places to swim if you don't mind the murky water. Most people think of the Caribbean as having the perfect blue water but it doesn't everywhere. There's a better market down in Orange Walk if you can get a ride but it's kinda far. They've got nice hammocks and if you're good at bartering you can get them for a steal! Watch yourself if you cross the border into Mexico to go shopping or whatnot. The Free Zone there has good deals but it's oh so shady. Man I miss Belize! Have a coke in a plastic bag for me!
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:05:06
It IS a glitch right? If someone had stolen it there'd be a transaction record wouldn't there? Unless there's some way to delete that info. Also, my account's not verified so there no way to withdraw I thought...
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:33:06
[This]( is the company we went through but it was WAY cheaper back when we did it. We also negotiated a group rate. That said, I know there are other companies in the area that do it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:06:40
It was never that high to begin with...
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:08:25
Litecoin is looking more and more like the betamax of cryptocurrency. But the upside is, it's not really going to go obsolete like beta did. More likely it'll be used as a commodity rather than a currency. That's certainly how it's being used now because almost nobody accepts it. It might take off if government regulation of bitcoin goes too far. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:45:44
Is...is this real? This is fake right?

Wow, seriously Apple? I miss my iPhone sometimes but then I remember how painless so much stuff is on Android. If only Sprint didn't suck...

I spent quite a lot of time in Central America and can honestly say you're wrong. I saw people living in cardboard boxes with laptops and internet access. Some of them were quite large. Some of them were starving to death but still paid for internet instead of food. No matter where you go people have screwed up priorities.

There will never be anything perfect, ever. It's just not possible. On the upside, pretty much all the thefts and security breaches have been due to human error rather than failure of the technology. For some reason someone stored something unencrypted, someone got greedy, someone let something slip. The tech is sound, people are not.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:19:08
You mean support is actually answering your questions? My whole account got wiped out yesterday. No answers. It wasn't hacked. There's simply no information. The bitcoins were there a few days ago, then yesterday they were gone. No account history showing a transaction. I am still waiting on their reply. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:23:53
Always good to diversify a bit. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:48:10
Thank God. Was about to freak out on Mtgox. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:51:29
Wait wait wait, you can't even get BTC out of Mt. Gox??? I've been working on getting verified so I can pull them out. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:00:55
Have 2 mine bitcoin. Mine litecoin with the other. That's what I'd do.
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:39:42
Not necessarily. This could be genuine interest. Bitcoin has gotten very popular the last couple weeks and a lot of services are opening up to it. This could just be the start of the growth. I think it'll slow down a bit but continue in a general upturn. But damn I freak every time there's a dip of a couple dollars.
@_date: 2013-03-05 12:41:36
Geez, does anyone know of a way to get an email or a text message when the price falls by say $1.00?
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:32:23
Come on $2000!
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:16:33
Oh man I just wanna call them Credits. "That'll be 100 credits pal." I just wanna live in the future that all the books and video games talk about.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:51:03
Could it mine altcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:54:38
I just don't get it. It's not even like I was hacked. The money's just...gone. Did they straight up steal my BTC???
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:45:12
And down they go. Just went down to $39.30

If you're headed south there are some places that are tourist traps but still totally awesome! The Mayan ruins at Lamanai are incredible. I wish I could remember the name of it but somewhere in the mountains was a place that you could go cave tubing. Sit on a rubber tube and relax while the river takes you through several caves. Easily one of the coolest things I've ever done. At one point the roof of a cave opens up and there's a waterfall above you with the jungle spilling in. Just unreal...
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:10:47
Thank you! I'll check these out. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:49:46
Kurzweil truly is the guru of the future. The man's predictions have been pretty much spot on for everything else. Why not bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-05 19:06:48
They're back up. It was a hiccup.
@_date: 2013-03-07 14:21:18
Got excited and then saw post date and got sad. Then saw recent posts and tips! You're tipping people more than I can mine in a day! Holy crap!
@_date: 2013-03-07 15:49:43
Ok I get that people are downvoting this for noobishness but I would really appreciate an answer at least.
@_date: 2013-03-08 00:19:55
Stop looking at the 10m chart and start looking at the 1Y chart. Hold your freakin's coins or send them my way!
