Both sides of this argument are talking as if they are solving the problem of scalability, when they are really avoiding it by shifting the question away from scalability for everyone, and toward scalability for a particular class of user.  
Small block and big block solutions both tacitly concede that a consensus-forming mechanism which is representative of all participants inputs simultaneously and fairly cannot exist.  
Each side picks a subset of the entire group and gives them first crack at forming consensus, because as things stand now there's no way to get input from the entire group at once. 
Both roads will lead to the same place, a network that has grown in reach as well as in volume. But who gets to be first in line on that road changes a bit.
Small blockers think it's better to manage this with shortcut arteries on top of a lightweight Bitcoin capillary network, and that the arteries can be made just as secure as Bitcoin itself.  OK, sure.  Who am I to argue with developers.   
In terms of who gets to set consensus in the short term (12 months), this seems to favor existing stakeholders more, because it doesn't require any immediate or short term changes and their investments are starting to pay off. Existing interests are important to serve because they got Bitcoin where it is in the first place; they are the ideological core who invested countless uncompensated hours, brainpower, and a lot of hard earned fiat to bootstrap Bitcoin up to the value it has. Lose their support, you lose Bitcoin's base for growth.
Big blockers think that it's better to make Bitcoin itself a heavier network of arteries, obviating the need for overlays, and Moore's law will take care of the rest.  Ok, sure.  Who am I to argue with Moore's law. 
In terms of getting the jump on setting consensus, this seems to favor newcomer interests more (same 12 month window), because they get to compete for consensus with the benefit of starting from scratch: mining on the internet of 2015, not 2010 - with no sunk costs in old infrastructure to pay down, and the benefit of not having to re-learn the expensive lessons already paid for by the existing interests. Newcomer interests are important to serve because they are where growth "grows" toward.

The user count will climb back up as noobs discover and subscribe, but a lot of the diversity brainpower in here has left in disgust or been forced out or discouraged and that's just unhealthy. Some of the posts I put my own time into reading and commenting on just vanished like poof.  come on.    
Many of the rest of us left wonder if "decentralized" and "censorship-resistant" are honestly valid descriptions of Bitcoin when it's been made bluntly clear that no, there are a handful of people who pull the strings when push comes to shove. Even admittedly idealists like myself have had to take a step back and reconsider basic assumptions about how this whole thing really works, compared to how we thought it works.  
If like me you have a decent chunk of money and personal reputation tied up in bitcoin your forced to suspend disbelief and play along for a while.  It's depressing because I used to be super open IRL about my belief in bitcoin but.... now some arguments I had defending its potential for good to family and coworkers... feel like I might have been on the wrong side of.

It's a quasi-legal short term loophole at best, and kudos to Purse for spotting and exploiting it, but I have heard it tossed off casually at Bitcoin functions and in forums multiple times as if it is a bullet point 'advantage' of Bitcoin on a systemic level, which elevates it over other forms of money and payments, not as the convenient but temporary gimmick that it really is.

Unlike Bitcoin, email isn't decentralized, it's not trying to be a totally self-contained economic universe unto itself, and it's working at all because it is not trying to be a perfect backbone for a purist technocratic utopia, just a "good enough" system with a lot of compromises that people have learned to live with.  
It's also not really a technology any more but more of a shorthand label for a whole boatload of things that all layer together, many of which are technologies but many of which are things like policies and habits and processes and conditioned expectations. 
Bitcoin is very, very unlike email.  It is trying to be something far more ambitious, and far less of an expensive, interdependent mess full of hidden costs.

Workers agreeing on what to hire capital for, how to allocate it and to which specific ends once hired - this is an extremely intractable problem to solve.  We're "hiring" Bitcoin and we have a nightmare just deciding on what it's supposed to do and who it is supposed to serve, and consequently how to shape its future (in the most recent example, via tuning the growth of the block size) to suit that supposed purpose.

Profit motive is the lowest common denominator of our species' value system.  It's a direct manifestation of the survival instinct we share with every living thing.

Everyone has it, even if they try to actively subvert it by re-projecting it on to the benefit of others.

Twitter is only good for free speech to *people who follow you*.  
On Reddit, anyone can post anything on any subreddit and people who have no idea who you are will see it, even if you are brand new.  
YES mods can censor it.  Yes they can ban you. 
But that is a mod's optional decision, not a built-in design characteristic of Reddit. On Twitter your default reach as a new user is zero. You can post anything you want but **nobody will see it unless they are following** you or it is part of a reply to someone else who chooses whether or not to include your handle in their reply (or RT you).  You have to play follow-me politics and build your network and even then you only reach who you already have convinced to follow you, which has a strong self selection-bias problem.  
Twitter is not "more free" that Reddit, even a censored Reddit like this one.  The freedom is constrained by different factors and they are much worse for newcomers than those on Reddit.  At least on here you can drop in on the most popular, active sub on the site, make a few posts, and reasonably expect that dozens if not hundreds or thousands of eyes will see what you have to say even if some of it gets buried, downvote censored or deleted.  You have to work hard to be a total pariah and get shadowbanned here and even then you can make a new account.

I basically agree with the overall slant you have on the issue of fairness.  But I think there are far more complexly layered transactions going on when paying for labor than "paying for labor".   
Every transaction involves a certain set of skills which may have nothing to do with the nature of the goods being transacted, but with the skill of making a transaction itself.  The ability to intuitively sense underpriced or overpriced goods and assets, the ability to maintain an ongoing personal inventory of one's values and balances (both tangible and intangible), the ability to predict where resources will be used with the most efficiency and where they will go to nonproductive waste, the ability to efficiently invest personal capital and judge whom and what to trust with its care, and many other skills. 
These skills have a high value to an economy, and that value is compensated in some cases actively (say, by hiring someone specifically and demonstrably talented in some or all of them), but in all other cases they are compensated passively by the act of performing a transaction of any kind, even theft or donation. Someone who is naturally skilled in this area is going to accrue rewards for it over time, even if they are not specifically seeking compensation for doing so.  
A complete system will not ignore this nor suppress it but instead try to acknowledge it and direct it toward the most appropriate ends.

Trying to fight a war on debt is as useless and naive as trying to fight a war on drugs.

I think we're headed for larger blocks thanks in part to Hearn forcing the issue on to the front burner.  Thats great, it shows there is more than one kind of response to consensus inputs that governs the direction of Bitcoin, and on the whole it kinda works the way it should. You want to control consensus? You must dedicate an appropriate amount of work toward shaping it the way you see fit.   
But even if we weren't going to get bigger blocks, I don't follow why you think that a smaller limit would be proposed by anyone who would do so to harm Bitcoin's growth, as if that were the underlying objective.  They might be forecasting the outcome of smaller block sizes incorrectly, but why do you feel this should be turned into an accusation about some nefarious scheme to hold Bitcoin back, when this isn't in their own best interests? 
If Bitcoin is seen as crippled nobody is going to buy it just because Blockstream claims it's fine, because they have made the best possible crutch for it. 
Your visuals on the this and the buttcoiner issue both seem to be excessively motivated by outrage, frustration and a need to point a finger at scapegoats and evildoers, rather than looking at things systematically and giving people credit for being not all that different than yourself once you get past the screen.

DDoS isn't necessarily a means to compromise security or fuzz your system looking for holes or exploits though it can be a tool to assist with such activities.  But just because an attacker doesn't have a reason to get at your protected data (because, as you seem to be implying, you don't have anything useful for them to get) doesn't mean they don't have a reason to DDoS you. 
It might be used to simply make your service unresponsive enough to be crippled.  As the term implies.  You still need a means to mitigate this.

The flip side of this is that Kim Kardashian has more market value (as a total market phenomenon, not merely in terms of her personal net worth), and better ability to leverage network effect, than Bitcoin does. 
Tens of thousands of other people could arguably replace Kim Kardashian's position in the market, she is the epitome of an interchangeable fabrication, a living meme.  So why her, and not someone else? What's different?
Look down your nose at it all you want but if you fancy yourself a rational and objective observer you will look at these things dispassionately and try to understand why they work, and resist the urge to dismiss them as "stupid".

Fair enough, but it's a completely different kind of decentralized than Bitcoin.  In fact it's just about as opposite to the way Bitcoin works as something can be and still be called "decentralized."

Ripple isn't even a crypto currency. I don't get why people think Ripple is "centralized Bitcoin", other than ignorance or stupidity.  
Yes, it is centralized. But no, it's not in any way trying to be a replacement for Bitcoin, an altcoin, or even a coin at all.  The only thing remotely similar to it is Stellar.  Just because the XRP token exists on exchanges and can be traded for other coins doesn't make it a coin itself.  Unlike any other actual crypto currency, the Ripple gateway network is a separate entity unto itself and could exist and function without the XRP token altogether if necessary.
It's usually day traders who make this comparison, and day traders are usually borderline imbeciles who don't look any deeper than chart voodoo and rumors anyway, so it's not surprising.

I consider premines to be scams only when they are not upfront about it.   If you know a coin is premined, and the reason for this is explained clearly as is the case with Ripple (which isn't even a coin anyway, but that's beside the point for now) and a few others that came later, then it's up to you to buy it based on the total package.  
A few very nasty and genuine scams have been pulled with hidden premines and it has a bad reputation because of this, but that doesn't mean there are no plausible launch strategies that include one.  **Including making the developers a big pile of cash.  There is NOTHING wrong with this** if you believe, as I do, that people should be rewarded for creating and supporting something that may ROI nicely later on.   
Sorry not sorry if this pisses off a certain kind of mining speculator who loves to leech value from a coin by mining as early as possible to cash out as big as possible.  Go mine a coin you can slam from day 1 with your shitty little pile of U3s in your basement,  knock yourself out.  Some of us prefer to reward developers as much if not more than miners.

Do you know how either system works?   Where to start... 
Email is client/server,  Bitcoin is based on peer to peer nodes. 
Email needs external message routing (DNS), Bitcoin routes messages internally.
Email doesn't need the entire network to confirm and validate every transaction, bitcoin does.  This is a huge one. 
Email depends on many externally secured trust mechanisms, Bitcoin secures trust internally, another huge difference. 
Email doesn't require every single server to be a completely redundant copy of every other server. Bitcoin does (for now) and it is far and away the most un-email-like way of doing things imaginable. 
I could list at least a dozen more major differences between the two but these are enough all by themselves.
How can you possibly wonder what the difference is?

They are starting to stumble into the right contacts in the community who are the next tier up from straight out criminals and who will make MLM crypto their specialty because it is going to be a gravy train of pain.  
If Bitcoin lets these people seize its message and deliver their sociopathic version of it to all the single mothers and recent immigrants and people looking for another way to bootstrap themselves (a bad way, but people have to start somewhere and this is what MLM pyramids shitheads prey on), then Bitcoin's overall image in the mind of the average person is going to get even worse than it is now thanks to other shithead efforts like cryptolocker.
God damn why does Bitcoin have to be so good at attracting all the most toxic cancer to itself.  Ironically, everything cash does well in this regard, Bitcoin does way better. 
Bitcoin needs a PR counterpunch to this, something to turn it from a liability into an opportunity. "To catch a scammer"

There's a reason gas pump prices don't fluctuate in real time with the spot market, same with jewelry stores and  their items made from gold/platinum/diamonds/etc..  Even the ones that do business entirely online with internal feeds from Rapaport etc, which could easily be set up to respond to spot market pricing do not do this. Its not because of inventory complications either, or they would do it for the increasingly popular custom made-to-order market which has no carried inventory component.
It's not done because most purchase decisions have a cost of their own - the decision itself has a **mental cost**, and shoppers have demonstrated again and again that they prefer to shop based on 'pretty good' prices that stay more or less constant, vs. very good prices that fluctuate unpredictably.
If the only thing you are shopping for is price, as in the case of a commodity, then you see the volatility as a benefit. Under almost every other circumstance it amounts to an extra cost even though that cost is hard to quantify.

This post was not written by the legendary Challenge Of Reverse Engineering (CORE) warez group, but props for being the first one to think of making that connection.

Why is it important whether there is a correlation at all?  Bitcoin lives or dies on network effect.  
If its appeal is constrained to: 
- a fraction (people who have heard of Bitcoin at all) 
- of a certain subset (people who both understand Bitcoin, and buy into it) 
- of a minority (people with an IQ compatible with understanding Bitcoin) 
- of the total potential market (people who use money), 
then it has an inherent limitation preventing it from growing beyond that sub-sub-sub-sub niche.  
What good does calling the group outside that niche "stupid" do to fix this?
