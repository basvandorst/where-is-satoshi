Ah yes, but you see, the invention is blockchain. The brand is Bitcoin. Blockchain will thrive, that is certain. Bitcoin on the other end...

No, it is a CFD. But close.

You just made my point. The technology in the car was  the engine (blockchain), not the car body (bitcoin) (which was just a horseless carriage body (currency), something that had been around in some form or other since the invention of the wheel (economy). 
You seem to think that blockchain is based on bitcoin and not the other way around.

It is indeed illegal to sell them to a US or HK person. Not to create one and/or to sell it to a company or a foreigner. They might not call it a duck, but if it quack like a duck, look like a duck... well you know the story. But fair enough.

Usually. But only if you leverage as a buyer. The seller of the CFD on the other hand is required to deposit margin regularly to follow the evolution of the contract if you use a third party broker, or as a buyer you need to take into account the counterparty credit risk of the seller if it is a 2 party contract. In the specific case of crypto, when you buy the crypto cfd, you post 100% margin. The value of the underlying cannot in principle go to below 0 (but why not really?). There are no legal requierement for cfd to be traded on margin only.

What the fuck are you talking about? You are saying blockchain did not exist before bitcoin? Did you even read the paper?  There are literally no reference to a blockchain as so in Satoshi's whitepaper. The only reference from Satoshi to block chain are in the actual code implementation of the bitcoin, so a year after the paper. There are blocks and chains reference in the paper, but neither as blockchain or block chain. Why? Because it was already invented, and hence accepted as a concept so no description was needed! The concepts of blockchain were already there since freakin 1991 (S. Haber and W. Stornetta), a paper directly cited in Satoshi's paper as a source. It was even improved several time, and used in application in 2005. Satoshi invented a novel way to use this for currency. There is also no reference to bitcoin in the Satoshi paper itself with the exception of the title. The paper decribe a peer to peer electronic cash system. It could be any coin, or any other system such as.  Bitcoin is just a brand and a usage, as currency, using the blockchain tech. Maybe you should read the paper, it is only 9 pages long. So no, blockchain is indeed the engine and bitcoin the car.

Decentralised, temper proof, virtualised, scalable, public ledger are not new??? Your argument is basically: A car is nothing more than transportation which we had forever because we have legs. Hence it is useless. As for decentralised currency, I agree, but there are many out there now. And not only bitcoin.
