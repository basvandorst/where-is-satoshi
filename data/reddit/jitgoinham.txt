I’m not selling because this looks so sustainable. ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:53:50
I’m confused. If bitcoins are worth more than you paid for them, at what point did you lose money?
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:17:28
Yeah, but the fact remains that he tried to have six people killed. He wrote all about it in his secret crime journal. He got life in prison because of it. They proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was the kingpin in an ongoing criminal organization. These facts are not in dispute.
So, no need for "allegedly" at this point, really.

Bitcoin isn't using p2p to swap black market intellectual property, is it?
The government hasn't made any effort to shut it down, have they?

No. His chat logs demonstrate he tried to have people murdered. His defense failed to refute the evidence. We can accept that this happened as a fact. Your boy is gonna die in federal prison as a result.
Explain to me how this is incorrect. I'd love to get some amateur legal analysis from an ignorant foreigner who's being duped by a transparent ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2015-06-03 01:59:22
I didn't say he was convicted. But the fact remains that he ineptly tried to have people killed. He paid a lot of money for it. All this evidence was presented, unrefuted, at the trial where he was convicted for running a criminal enterprise.
You should check out those chat transcripts. They are public record now and a great read. They prove he tried to have people murdered.
@_date: 2015-06-03 02:29:57
How about facilitating credit card fraud, identity theft, hacking and murder? If Ross was the broker between a hacker and an the identity thief who ruined your life and good credit, would you wish him to be prosecuted for that? It certainly is a criminal act currently.
Sure, he moved $183 million in drugs, but also over a million dollars worth of forged documents and stolen credit cards. Are we to assume no one was victimized as a result of those transactions? Are there buyers who are just really into collecting other people's credit card data?
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:01:33
Ross tried to have six people murdered, you know. That's among the reasons he got life prison.
@_date: 2015-06-03 04:12:02
The defense never claimed the chat logs were altered.


The Bitcoin ledger authenticates the chat logs. This was presented as evidence also.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:11:25


Because the fact that he tried to have people murdered was considered in his conviction and sentencing, being that its relevant to the charge of running a criminal enterprise. As such they gave him life in prison for trying to have people killed. Refuting that evidence would have been wise.
The fact that he hasn't been tried for the attempted murder indictment (as yet) doesn't change the fact that he tried to have people murdered.
It's like, no one has indicted the FBI for the allegedly illegal searches, but people 'round here seem to act like that alleged violation of Ross's civil rights was already adjudicated upon by a jury of his peers, despite the lack of any convincing evidence that seizing the Silk Road server was illegal in any way.
On the other hand we have Ross in his own words ordering hits, right there in black-and-white, but suddenly the complexities of due process are more germane to the crimes than the kid's own criminal admissions.

What does that mean? You believe piracy exists?
Or you believe it's okay to earn money for peddling someone else's intellectual property while also ensuring the creator cannot profit from it? Is that what you mean?

I'm confused. Someone compiled a list of people who died in suicides and accidents, and then seems absolutely *stunned* and *astonished* that the list doesn't contain people who died of natural causes.
Was this submitted just to make fun of some conspiracy nutjob's mental illness? Because that's just cruel.

Yeah those fees are killer.
What's the overhead converting dollars to btc? What would the overhead had been if I'd bought coins in November to buy something today?
I have yet to come across a situation I couldn't handle with cash, a check, an electronic transfer, or PayPal. As such I don't see a future where people use btc because I don't see a future where I'd need it.

He was already "hit with" the murder charges in a second indictment filed Oct 1st. He's going to be the defendant in a murder trial regardless of the outcome of the drug trafficking and money laundering trial.
By the looks of it, he left enough evidence to guarantee easy convictions across the board.
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:07:34


The indictment *is* the charge ya dingus. He was charged with attempted murder in October. He will face these charges in a federal court in Baltimore. Quit talking out of your butthole.

I doubt a mistrial will increase the value of your coins, so attempting to undermine the justice system via criminal jury tampering seems like a waste of time.
Even if Ulbricht beats this rap he's headed to Baltimore next to stand trial for conspiracy to commit murder anyway. So what's the point.

Be sure to include this data when trying to convince jurors that money laundering, drug trafficking and murder-for-hire shouldn't be crimes.

Cars, electricity and computers all solved real world problems that regular people could understand. "How can I get there faster?" "How can I add these numbers quickly and accurately?"
I don't know what question people are asking that has the answer "Bitcoin" besides "How can I purchase contraband online semianonymously?" I don't see what this technology offers for Joe DollarEarner on the street.

Wikileaks, who is definitely *not* working with the Russians, released an unverified document that says the CIA is capable of adding Russian fingerprints to hacks.
Therefore the CIA hacked the DNC to help get Trump elected for... reasons... but now the CIA is undermining Trump with fake Russian leaks because... apparently *opposite* but equally mysterious reasons.
It all makes *too* much sense.

I get the impression that no one in this community would ever, *ever* suggest selling because they have a personal financial interested in inflating the bubble.

The cops frog-marched him through the school in handcuffs. Then the cops took him to juvie and fingerprinted him.
Then the school suspended him for three days.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:34:48
Yes he was. The evidence that he tried to have his rivals murdered led directly to his conviction and life sentences.
The judge even said so explicitly during the sentencing hearing.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:33:41


No, this was the story told by the evidence presented at Ulbricht's public trial.
His defense made no effort whatsoever to challenge the authenticity of the chat logs in which Ross tries to hire hitmen to commit murders.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:03:56


It is true. The evidence he tried to hire hitmen was presented during his trial.


He was charged with being the mastermind of a criminal enterprise. His attempts to have his rivals murdered was used to convict him. He's going to die in prison as a result.


Ross definitely sucks at trying to kill people. It's still illegal if you're bad at it. It's a good thing he's in jail.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:11:46


Being a for-profit broker for stolen identities and hacking tools hurts actual people who are the victims of hacks and identity theft.


He wasn't entrapped. He was caught.


Regulating marketplaces is dangerous because unregulated marketplaces like the Silk Road are safer than... other unregulated marketplaces?

He was convicted to life in prison because he ran a criminal enterprise. Part of the evidence presented at his trial proved he attempted to have people murdered in exchange for Bitcoin. This evidence was corroborated and never refuted.
What's the point in pretending it didn't happen? Does Ross become a folk hero if he never tried to murder people?
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:18:14


It definitely was and Ulbricht was definitely convicted.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:14:00
Ross got a life sentence because he tried to hire hitmen to murder his business rivals.
@_date: 2015-02-10 02:45:37
Admitting you were wrong about him not being charged would be easy.
