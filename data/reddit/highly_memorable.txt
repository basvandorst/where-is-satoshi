Fair enough, good luck with it anyway. It's not anti-crypto hysteria, by the way, it is simply that I'd like to know what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:22:00
Fair enough. Actually, I don't think it's a bad thing to be into, but I still don't get it. No offence intended at any point.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:55:04
Yes, but in terms of the non-user interface side of things, my bank is regulated, secure, and my money is protected by legal guarantees. I even get it back if I'm defrauded. So basically, my question would be, is bitcoin ever really likely to make it in terms of something I will end up using?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:00:52
Well, good luck with it anyway!
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:55:00
Really? Care to expand?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:32:48
So, the thing is, while the price is now higher than it was a month ago, why is that? Admittedly you can now trade futures, but nothing has changed in terms of what it does or what you can do with it. You couldn't do much with bitcoin a month ago, you can't really do much with it now.
What you might be able to do with it? Well that's just wild speculation. But unless you can do something useful with it, it's massively overvalued in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:35:58
No worries! Happy new year anyway!
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:27:51
How about if you were using it as a savings account, you put your savings in, and you needed to take them out again 2 weeks later, like you can with a savings account.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:41:58
Actually though, if it's only value is the ability to transmit value then it doesn't seem to be very valuable. I am not in need of any extra ways to transmit value beyond the ones I already have, and bitcoin doesn't offer any new features beyond what I already have that I need, or do what I can already do any better.
There already is a "financial internet" - it's called the banking system.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:24:00
I'd have to say, watching bitcoin unfold, the emphasis among bitcoin devotees has definitely gone from trying to get people to use it as a currency to trying to get people not to spend it so the supply is limited and the price goes up.
Short term, that makes a few people some cash, but long term unless you *can* use it, and also it offers any advantage over traditional banking, (which in a developed economy it doesn't), why would anyone use it? And if nobody uses it why is it worth money? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:08:46
But now you are talking more like it is a speculative investment, i.e something you buy, knowing it's a risk, but hoping it will go up in value in the long term. Like shares or bonds.
Isn't it meant to be a currency? Without people trading it because they need it to exchange for goods and services, how does the price keep going up long term? People just keep buying it, so it just keeps going up?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:44:00
Yes, but why and for what? Pardon me for asking, but I don't quite see any circumstance where a virtual wallet I can pay for things with in the same way as I can with a debit card is better than a debit card - what would I be able to do, or even do better, that I can't now?
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:57:25
I think the volatility of the currency would still be an issue. You'd still have to buy stock in fiat money, so you might buy $20K of stock and sell it in bitcoin while it's at $20K, but by the time you cash in your bitcoin to restock it's only worth $15K...
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:51:35
Fair enough, I think that answers the question on what it's all about then, it's a distributed ledger.
The only thing I would say though, as to why it might crash down to zero over time, is that if people need a distributed ledger why do they need *that* distributed ledger. The ledger itself is just data churned out by software, and while you can't fiddle the contents of the ledger, you don't have to pick that ledger to use. You could use another one, or start your own. A better ledger technology might come along.
Still, like you say, who knows. Happy new year!
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:24:52
Totally. Like the casino, don't put it on the table if you need it to pay the rent!
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:49:07
But is crypto growing? People are buying it but nobody spends it or accepts it that I can see.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:38:02
But I don't think tx fees and times are the only limiting factor in terms of it's use as a currency. Nobody wants a volatile currency since what you sell might not yield a profit, and nobody wants a currency that always increases in value since there is no incentive to spend it.
Volatility or accumulating value is what you want from things you invest your money in, not the money itself surely?
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:48:55
But how? Surely, you need someone to turn you crypto into cash, and where can you do that that isn't a bank? In a situation where currency became scarce, I should add, so other people on probably won't have cash to hand either.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:37:56
But are you really so concerned about what happened in Greece being likely you would put substantial wealth in an unregulated financial black market like crypto? And anyway, if they froze the bank accounts (like Greece) how would you get your money out - if retailers don't accept crypto, you still need to turn it into cash.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:02:27
Seems bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment. When you buy bitcoin you aren't actually buying anything tangible like a share of a company that has assets and a plan / forecast for future trading in a known market, or a fiat currency which is at least backed with reserves. You're literally buying something unknown on the basis that because nobody knows what will happen it might go well. Of course, it might also not. Good luck anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:19:12
1. The countries with hyperinflation struggle massively - it isn't something you would pick over using a currency which didn't suffer from it. 
2. Because the value people attribute to it is fuelled by speculation, and it is going up at a rate that is not sustainable, nor matched by an increase in the utility (and therefore likely future value) of bitcoin. Bitcoin use isn't going up in a practical sense, a currency depends on use and adoption or it's (literally) useless.
3. Bitcoin isn't a better implementation of blockchain it is simply there first. There is no salient feature of bitcoin that is better technologically than the majority of other implementations.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:11:39
Well, the internet still has neutrality apart from in a few police states and dictatorships.
I still don't see why that would be a selling point for bitcoin over any other currency unless I was trying to evade taxes, for example? For simply going about legal day to day business that is.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:22:05
I would class it as a gamble rather than an investment.
The technology is there, it has flaws (high tx fees, slow tx), the environment is risky (unregulated leading to insider trading etc, scams), the future is uncertain regarding what people might end up using it for (is it currency? Not really).
The reason it is highly volatile in price is nobody knows what will happen, and if you don't know what will happen you're gambling with you money.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:04:10
But what new information would be driving this price increase?
Will the price go up because:
* Transaction fees and times drop massively, making it practical for use as a currency?
* A consortium of major retailers pledge support for its use as a currency?
* Because it's bitcoin, and it will always go up because you don't need reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:52:46
Yes, but why would anyone buy any? Taking the Amazon example, if I've got money in a bank account I can spend on Amazon, why would I turn any into AmazoCoin that I can only spend on Amazon? It would be like buying Amazon gift vouchers to use Amazon, when I could just use Amazon.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:33:25
Hmm... The same shape line, but over 8 years for gold, over 6-7 months for bitcoin. Leftmost point of the chart to the highest peak? 14 years for gold, 11 months for bitcoin. Lowest point to highest point for gold? ~5x for gold, ~20x for bitcoin.
Bitcoin has gone up much further much faster than gold, but ultimately on the back of no new progress / information. It has no practical use as a currency due to tx times and fees and massive volatility in price. It's position as de facto market leader in crypto is first mover advantage rather than technological superiority. There is nothing at the moment to justify it's gains or indicate their sustainability.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:43:48
Thing is, if it goes back to $2K, an investment a year ago would still have made a substantial profit.
The high price at the moment is driven by people wanting to buy some because it's a finite quantity and it could become a new currency alternative, making it potentially cheap at the moment while it isn't widely adopted and you can't use it for much.
If it doesn't become a plausible alternative to traditional currency (and aside from the fact you can't use it as a currency for technical reasons at the moment - who would want a volatile, unregulated alternative to something tried and trusted anyway?) it is basically worth nothing $1-2K is still a lot to pay for a long, unique number.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:47:27
Hmm. So there's 6 billion people on earth, and less than one million active bitcoin addresses, more than one of which may be owned by one person?
And, it takes ages for transactions to complete, at a higher price than (safer, regulated) traditional methods. And the price is too volatile to use as a currency for regular retail purchases anyway.
What is it for again? Please explain like I'm 5.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:46:59
We were talking about commodities not money, not sure where dollar bills come in.
There are diamond mines in only 13 of the 196 countries on earth, so you don't find them commonly and the vast majority if people don't own any, so yes they are rare.
Also, production cost and value are not the same thing. I was saying that diamonds have intrinsic value, i.e a value of themselves other than that which people are willing to pay because there are certain things for which only a diamond will do.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:04:52
Yes, it seems like it set out to do a thing (i.e become a *useful* currency, that offered advantages from an anything anywhere easily perspective) didn't make it, so people seized on it and turned it into something else.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:35:13
We'll see!
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:08:44
I still don't see a convincing argument as to why anyone with access to a stable, regulated banking system needs to use a volatile, unregulated alternative (cryptocurrencies) to do anything legal / legitimate.
What advantage could it offer? 
Is it faster or cheaper? No.
Is it accepted in more places? No.
The only reason people are buying is that cryptocurrencies *might* have some purpose in the future, which is pushing prices up in the short term. But there doesn't seem to be a clear picture of what cryptocurrency people might end up using, why they would pick that crypto above the others, or why they would pick crypto over fiat.
It's all just optimism and speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:53:05
Hmm, transactions, yes but how many people made those transactions? Was it not that many people making lots of buys and sells, i.e just day traders? Are there more places - shops restaurants, online, where you can *spend* it? Is it actually considered a currency yet? I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:58:48
Well, not no value.
Let's say I have a screwdriver, and I need to put in a screw. 
Having another screwdriver doesn't give me anything I haven't got, but I suppose it still has value as a screwdriver.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:07:48
I'm not totally sure used globally is quite right though. You can only use it when you change it back into money and put that into a bank account in 99.99999% of situations.
Too volatile, tx fees too high, tx too slow. Not money yet!!
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:55:38
Fair enough, good luck with it!
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:00:59
Checking accounts are I assume the same as current accounts, and therefore come with a chequebook, debit card and credit facilities (an overdraft). So you can basically use it for purchases without having to withdraw money.
A savings account doesn't necessarily have those extra facilities, but should still allow you to access your savings at any time you want to.
Furthermore, when you say you would have made $170, you are ignoring the rather obvious fact you would be guaranteed $30170 back after 2 years. Putting $30K into bitcoin might mean you get back less, or nothing. There are absolutely no guarantees bitcoin will be worth a penny in a month from now.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:45:11
Regulation is, to a large extent, the answer to life's problems. Otherwise you have anarchy and chaos.
I hate to break it to you, but it is not my regulatory framework, hence I am unable to get it in order. However, what has happened since the last financial crisis is indeed that the regulatory framework has been adjusted such that the same thing will not happen again. Certainly in this country there were massive and wide ranging reforms involving separating retail and investment banking, creating new financial governing bodies etc.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:24:32
Ah, OK. Makes sense then.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:55:04
That's what I thought it was meant to be, a universal, spend it anywhere, any shop, any country, any time currency.
I think the "use case" had shifted since that hasn't happened and now plan B is that it's a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:30:40
Looking at Greece as an example, did people really turn to bitcoin? Did vendors start accepting bitcoin from customers? No. Did they then spend those bitcoin replenishing stock from wholesalers? No. Did bitcoin become a feasible alternative to the euro? No. The vast majority of people accepted the temporary throttling of accounts until the central banks got a handout from Europe and carried on as normal. Last time I heard, people spend euro in Greece not bitcoin.
Even if you put your money into bitcoin, you'd have to turn it into euro to use it, so what good is that?
Furthermore, while you could have made a large return on bitcoin over the same period, that would have been a risky investment at the time. If you took your $30K to Vegas 2years ago, you could have come home with $1.5 million. Or nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:13:41
But this is another thing I find confusing about bitcoin. If it can't add features above what's already there, and it isn't a better value proposition (cheaper, faster, easier) - in what way is it meant to be *the future*?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:01:53
Right. So that is now what it's about. Returning banks to their proper place in society. So it's not about currency, or speculation, or a store of value. Or it is, but it's not because it's about something else. And if I ask how it actually does that, then it's not about that, but it's actually about something else, because it's definitely something. Definitely.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:01:23
I wouldn't even say that's particularly skeptical.
It seems very much that crypto currency doesn't have the reliability, stability, and utility of a fiat currency. It also doesn't have the security of regulated financial conduct amongst the people providing financial services (there's insider trading, scams, all sorts going on).
The whole thing seems to be based on this utopian vision of the future where you buy now, hold on, and at some point magic will happen and you'll be rich.
Five years ago I'm sure I used to read articles on tech blogs about people trying to live on bitcoin for a week, or a month - why is this no more possible (indeed less so) than it was then? And why, given that it hasn't advanced is it more valuable?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:21:53
But still, even *if* it offered an electronic payment method you can carry around, and use in shops and online, with low fees and instant verification - almost everyone's already got that. What does it actually offer, that gives it a practical advantage for everyday people / uses? What problem is it a solution to?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:14:32
Well, we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. I'd say something like grass or trees are common, and something that is scarce and difficult to come by, like diamonds, are rare. But to each their own.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:57:08
But what if you need your money when you need your money? Savings accounts pay a known, flat rate of interest, your money goes up (possibly not above inflation, but never down in absolute terms) and you can access it when you need it.
Bitcoin is *not* a savings account. You might not be able to take it out yet, because you'd be taking a loss. You might not have enough for what you were saving for because the value is down. Worst case, you could lose all your savings.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:54:27
But, supposing you live in Venezuela, and you needed somewhere to put your money to keep it  free from inflation, so you put it in Bitcoin 2 weeks ago, you'd have lost a third as of today. So, that didn't work.
And you also didn't want the government to know about your off grid money but then when you went to take it out so you could spend it, you made a transfer into a government run bank. So that didn't work.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:54:34
So, there's this mysterious, controversial figure who was around for a few years, had a utopian vision of a new way and left instructions with a small group of followers.
Years later, people debate the true meaning of his teachings, indeed some even wonder whether he existed. Small communities form, based on their own interpretation of "the truth" with their own slightly different practices and rituals.
What does it all sound like?
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:40:44
Gold, and diamonds are definitely rare. First thing I get when I use the search term "diamonds rare":
"Diamonds are the hardest material found on earth. Other than that, they hold no unique distinctions. All gem grade materials are rare, composing just a tiny fraction of the earth. However, among gems, diamonds are actually the most common."
Sorry, but facts are facts, and you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:38:57
That is a fantastic answer, thanks.
Basically, bitcoin isn't a currency as such / yet.
It isn't a payment channel as such / yet.
It is a potential technology that could be used to facilitate as yet unrealised theoretical applications.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:46:03
Yes, actually. I can access online banking now, and I can do basically anything on it I need to do with a bank.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:32:53
Not really sure that list really provides anything above the standard banking system - I certainly wouldn't say it works as a store of value owing to it's volatility.
With regard to other digital assets, it still isn't the same. If you want a particular address (email, web) you need that particular address or you can't do what you are trying to do (i.e give out that address to communicate via that channel). 
With bitcoin, if what you are trying to do is buy something, well basically you can just go ahead and buy it without bitcoin. There is no use case really, for a currency, where bitcoin / crypto wins. Apart from "I want to do my transactions in secret" which is really an edge case I would say.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:44:00
If you decided to use it as a savings account, and put in $30K 2 weeks ago, you'd have $20K today. How is that beating inflation, or better than putting it in a savings account where you'd still have $30K?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:17:26
But, important enough to get into what is (currently at least) a very sketchy looking, unregulated fiscal black market? And anyway, assuming you are in a regime where people might look at what you do with your money (let's say North Korea) wouldn't they just torture you till you showed them the details if they saw you were using crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:08:38
It's ok, I can't spend dollars around here. You could get me reddit gold if you like.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:52:41
That's the thing - in five years no significant advances have been made where any of these things are more likely to happen. Cutting out the financier on a large ticket transaction exposes you to the risk rather than the financier themselves, and bitcoin doesn't seem to offer anything in terms of micro-charging given the transaction fees are currently more than for traditional payment methods.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:51:45
Isn't the need for oversight and regulation something that has been hard learned, and the measures in place evolved accordingly, over thousands of years, with the current financial systems built around reliable fiat currencies people can actually use?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:39:18
Yes, and in Q1 2017 it didn't have much going for it as a currency. I don't think you can spend it on retail goods in more places today than you could then - less even. So, really, it could go to less than that. Assuming that the primary goal of a crypto*currency* is as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:33:34
I'm saying that level of volatility makes it fundamentally bad for use as a currency.
I still don't understand what it is, but nobody seems really able to nail it. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:58:59
I think anyone putting money into something nobody has done before and nobody controls, with nothing actually backing it and no guarantees shouldn't be surprised it could go down as easily as up.
So, anyone who put a significant amount of their overall wealth into it had lost their mind already in my opinion. Good luck to everyone, but it is a gamble!
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:17:48
Ah yes, but the thing with that is that I don't do any sort of transactions I would object to people finding out about, so again this is really an invented problem crypto can solve but not really one that matters in a real sense as far as I can see. I don't see that as a proper selling point.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:31:59
I would say out of the people in the developed world, with access to the internet, most people have a bank account, and by extension online banking and card services.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:57:07
But that's the point - you can make jewellery out of gold and diamonds, and because you can, and they are rare and unique they are expensive. That is a use for gold and diamonds. If you want a 4 carat diamond engagement ring, you have to buy a 4 carat diamond. What do you actually need bitcoin for? What can you do with bitcoin that you can't do with anything else? Nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:21:53
That said, although you can inform yourself of the technology, the rate of adoption (which seems low in terms of places you can use it as a currency), the factors likely to affect adoption (e.g transaction fees/ times and methods of overcoming, new government restrictions potentially being imposed etc) it is still unregulated and basically miners, "whales" and anyone else with a potential interest in manipulating it can manipulate it and I don't think there are penalties - unlike the stock market for example.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:38:30
Well thanks, genuinely it was informative.
I've been vaguely watching bitcoin for at least five years, and I still can't figure out what it might end up as being. 
Secret money seems to be the thing, but who wants secret money?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:44:09
In principle, yes. I think there is a higher charge on international transfers if I have to wire it, but I certainly have the ability.
Failing that, there's PayPal...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:41:24
Just a thought, but maybe Morgan Stanley know a bit about currencies and economics.
At the moment the actual uses for bitcoin seem limited, i.e you can't use it as a currency for practical reasons - it takes too long and costs too much, and it seems like people are basically buying it in order to have some at what would be a low price relative to the number in existence if it became a new global currency.
The reason the price is high is because people want it and nobody is selling it, but if it won't end up being useful as a currency people won't want to buy it and it will be worth nothing. What is it actually for otherwise?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:23:10
Fair enough, so there is no straightforward compelling reason this might actually have a use in the future, but it will work if people believe it will work?
Can't see anything remotely dodgy about that. Who was Satoshi Nakamoto again? Oh, yeah. So apart from the fact he doesn't have any compelling arguments, he might not even exist.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:02:27
Fair enough. If I want to move £1 between bank accounts, online, now, I can go and do it, instantly, for no fee and take it out of a cashpoint instantly or spend it via debit card in any shop I can walk into.
*That* is transmitting value. Can't do any of that with unusable bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:38:53
Actually, not quite because free market commodities have intrinsic value coming from their utility. Name a  market traded commodity (other than bitcoin) that you can't use for something. Precious metals have uses, oil has uses, crops have uses etc. Bitcoin is just a number, which has no purpose in the real world - nobody needs it for anything, and at the moment you can't use it for anything.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:12:23
Yes, and would be kicking themselves forever if they passed on cashing out with enough to pay off the mortgage etc. My point is that if it's a proper crash, people seem to be looking at it as it might "crash" back to a 50% gain over 12 months, but it could quite easily crash back to virtually nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:31:46
Yes, I can see that is one perspective on it, but I'm not sure enough people don't like the banks enough not to maintain the status quo. I don't think the average working person would have sufficient motivation in not having a traditional bank account even if the practical / technological aspects (e.g high fees, slow tx, poor support from retail vendors, technological barriers to entry) weren't there. Not everyone's a zealot.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:29:27
Yes, see that is really what fascinates me about bitcoin.
I used to be vaguely interested in it about 5 years ago, and the emphasis was definitely about how it might be used as a currency. That's what I remember.
Now, people just talk about price, and making money on it. It is definitely not what it was once meant to be.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:00:33
Like the dotcom years all over again...
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:28:36
PayPal would be faster, easier and in my opinion safer.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:11:10
No, not really, I just don't get it. No offense intended.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:25:05
If you think so, but surely it only increases in value if people keep buying it, and nobody seems to know why people *are* buying it. You can't spend it, nobody accepts it, it has no guarantees, no controls, no regulation.
Literally nobody even knows what it is actually for.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:05:10
Yes. A banknote does not have value in itself, it has value because:
* It can be exchanged for goods and services anywhere in the country where it is legal tender.
* It's value is underwritten by a central bank who guarantee what it is worth.
Crypto obviously doesn't have a central bank backing it, and it can't (yet) be exchanged for goods and services anywhere much.
So it must just be speculation that *one day* you'll be able to use it to buy things. But if that doesn't happen it's worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:27:06
Ah yes, these people in repressive regimes where you don't have free internet access (where you have internet access) and if it looks like you are doing strange crypto things on the internet they'll beat you until you tell them what. They possibly wouldn't want it, you see, because it's probably better not to go to prison for having it.

Fair enough. So, basically we're still talking mainstream adoption, which means average people using it on a daily basis, like buy a pint of milk in any shop in town. We're agreeing that's not there, and most likely to get it there will need a solution on the tech side and user / business adoption. Businesses will adopt it if paying customers want it, and the only real USP for customers using bitcoin is that it's not a bank. I still don't think that will swing enough people, but it's not really something we can answer. I guess we'll know in a few years!

Hmm. First thing I got on the search term "gold rare" 
"Gold owes its status as a precious metal to its rarity: all the gold mined throughout history would fit into a square box with sides of around 20m in length. That’s not because of a failure to mine more. Gold is rare throughout the Universe because it’s a relatively hefty atom, consisting of 79 protons and 118 neutrons."

Guess it's rare. Like diamonds.

Also, isn't bitcoin subject to capital gains tax rather than income tax? Income tax is payable over the period you earned it, capital gains is payable when you sell the asset - so if you buy a classic car for $20K, but sell it in 10 years for $100K, you pay the same tax as if you sold it in 5 years for $100K (I.e it's a flat percentage, when you sell it). In my country anyway...

You can have all the bitcoin I own for $500,000.

Cheers. Let's just say I'm a lot older than I look then!

Ok, but there's a couple of things there:
* A dollar in 1915 would not have purchasing parity with a dollar in 2017, not sure if that is adjusted for inflation (or it makes a difference)
* There have been periods in history where gold has gone up and down by quite large margins in quite short spaces of time.
So, I suppose what we're saying is that if a Venezuelan put it in bitcoin, it might go up or down, if they put it in gold it might go up or down.
Gold is the traditional store of value, so if ok for gold to be volatile, it's ok for bitcoin.
But, I would still maintain there is a greater likelihood bitcoin will crash to nothing while it doesn't have any utility beyond being a thing you can buy.

To take an objective view, I suppose your house has probably gone up in value since you bought it, which means if it went up more than you paid in, including mortgage (i.e you were in profit and now you're not quite so much) it could be worse.
