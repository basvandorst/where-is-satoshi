You have to be a troll but lets use YOUR points to validate mine.
"By the way, what you just sent me is like me sending you 11 different wallets and claiming that those are all different kinds of Bitcoins."
Wrong, it would be like me sending you Bits of Proof, btcd or bitcoind. These are implementations of the bitcoin protocol. And I sent you 2, not 11. 11 does not equal 2.
hy•poth•e•sis (haɪˈpɒθ ə sɪs, hɪ-)
n., pl. -ses (-ˌsiz)
1. a provisional theory set forth to explain some class of phenomena, either accepted as a guide to future investigation (working hypothesis) or assumed for the sake of argument and testing.
So your just talking semantics.
These two papers propose a hypothesis and the two wallets test these hypothesis'.
The fact is they both are not testing the same thing, they are not inter-operable like bitcoin implementations currently although I think the developers want to bring them together.
But you're good at this, maybe some day you can become a politician and spout shite for money - oh wait, we're trying to get rid of those. Im sure something will come up requiring your particular set of shit skills.

My bitstamp acccount is hard to withdraw from, needs 2fa, then an email link which goes to a gmail account which is also 2fa enabled. Should be no way of fucking with this. Should be impossible to withdraw from. 2 fa is on an old android, doesnt recieve mails, has no apps...

Im in Ireland, we have recently entered negative interest rates but we have effectively had them for a while. Banks are going to float this as no interest and an increase in charges. Also gov. charges 25 euro a year for all accounts. So deposit 1000, wait 1 year come out with 975. No way around this, the banks all have the same board members, they are called the golden circle as they move between the top banks BOI, AIB and TSB. Used to be another, Anglo, but they went bust in 2008 from giving loans to the board to buy shares in their own bank. I guess the word is a cartel? So yea. No options for daily banking without charges.

I get the feeling your being pessimistic and its clouding your judgment. This is not an exchange, its a piece of wallet software. It opensource and works like electrum in that it has servers interfacing with the bitcoin daemons on its behalf. Its easily replicated by other wallet software and overcomes the first problem you have listed. This will make transactions instant. Not near instant, actually instant. If it works, it will be an idea picked up by the wider community.
This is the protocol level. If the improvement works, it will become part of what we call the protocol in a few years.
As an example, heres the protocol we are communicating across now, which has been maintained and improvements discussed and agreed upon by Wc3.
Changes come in stages, the protocol is the finished version of what works best. Bitcoin is at the beginning of this and you are right it needs improvement. But it is just at the beginning.
From wikipedia, http first appeared in 1991. Version one appeared in 1995. 
This is where bitcoin is. Internet was crap back then too. Perspective.

This logic is incorrect. Colored coins have been a theory for a long time. There are many implementations of this, counterparty is just one of them. They all 'color' certain bitcoins to be used in a sub system on top of bitcoin. Some products call this colored coins and some get you to burn into a new currency to use it. The thing about the way this protocol does it is that you aren't using up burnt bitcoins to do it, you can change them back if you need to.

Support take up to 6 hours to get back to me usually, sometimes a day or so. Usually their answers are scripted, I have gotten the same answers before when asking them about such delays.

Its not that, just for their investment they, if they sold and recouped their original investment, then sold their remaining bitcoins at anything above 15 is a &gt;100% profit. They could easily let it slide to this. Well maybe not easily but it would start to get harder not to sell as the price fell to this point. Remember its just an experimental investment for these guys. The return is well made already.

@_date: 2013-11-05 15:12:54
Hi, Ive had an idea for a while but I can't develop. I've researched it fairly well though.
It goes like this. So Im a merchant who wants to use bitcoin. Already companies like bitpay are springing up to fill the gap. In reality though, these companies are unecessary. 
Already software like acceptbit (which was written quickly) can accept payments and run a simple merchant front end. If a customer had an account with Bitstamp set up, an API linked to thenmerchant front end should be able to run their whole operation without needing bitpay at all. The API call backs to the exchange (a link could be written for different exchanges) could sell their coins instantly, grab address for deposits, withdraw the cash to their account etc. Even under 2FA for withdrawals). This cuts out the middle man completely while also giving the user control of when to sell so they could hedge up their profits if the market was looking like it does now. Percentages could be set etc.
Also bitstamp runs on 3 confirmations, which is pretty quick.
This idea holds through to the idological idea behind bitcoin more so than the current centralisation which is forming. The less people between you and your money the better. Why trush a processor who is using an exchange (2 steps) Just pick your own exchange and have tools to API to it.
Edit: Bitstamps API  Deos everything but wash the sink

it's funny, I was pondering your arguments for a long time today. I believe this one is in-correct. Although I think the Winklevoss's are douches, they were smart enough to buy their bitcoins when they were 15 dollars. They may have even sold the investment amount before hiding away the remainder as they so publicly declared (the 1% - will we ever escape these fuckwits :-). So, why bother sell at all. They don't need the money. And even game theory would suggest they probably would wait until they were really low before even bothering. Im guessing $15 again. But for bitcoins to fall this low they would have to have no intrinsic value, which they do. As a free currency, they have already proved that - Silk Road, up time 3 years approx. What do you think?

Hey I liked this comment and was just messing around with passguardian the last few days. I noticed something in testing that was wierd and wondered if it was leaking part of the codes.
I made a test case and put in two of the keys to reconstruct the secret. I then manually just start flipping digits on the strings and most of the code stayed in tact with just like the first letter changing or something else like that. I was under the impression that a completely corrupt key would result in complete garbage as opposed to order with minimal gaqrbage disturbance to the secret.

Im using Linux anyway so I assumed it was free of any malware (clean install, cecked key of distro) I just use the VMs to do offline wallets. (So a linux VM in a Linux distro). Should be safe enough just this info I got today makes me wonder about linux at all (these distros based on ubuntu)

Better to launch you're own in game blockchain with variations that work for the installation you need it for. Maybe even peg it to bitcoin at a very low rate at the start. ( 1gamecoin = .00001BTC)

Are they taking a break from withdrawing btc also? Doesnt mention it in the notice
@_date: 2013-05-20 09:57:02
Just a note on this. I did a SEPA withdrawal about 20 days go and it still has not arrived. In Europe apparently they can only do so many withdrawals a day and Im on the list. But 20 days? Whats going on? Thats practically useless...

I actually got a programmer on reddit 4 hire to code the orderform. I paid him in bitcoin... It was very reasonable.

I agree completely and it's something a lot of people have been trying to say but you put it nicely. If you made money on bitcoin, take a punt and try build some kind of business with it... The more everyone makes the thing useful, the more this speculation becomes justified a the usability of the currency becomes real as opposed to just a hypothetical superior currency. + €.20 tip

What am I looking at? Fans with wallets to match is it?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:14:00
No, I dont have a referal program. My site is on that list. I dont have any kind of ads or referral set up.

Bridgewalker may solve this, haven't had a chance to try it but the idea is genius.

I think I'm getting better at this, it looked so fake this time. Is this fallacy in my head? Like nothings happening and some guy is just sitting there freaking out...bang quick sell. deoesn't seem plausible, more likely it was a trick
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:18:11
Yes definately.
