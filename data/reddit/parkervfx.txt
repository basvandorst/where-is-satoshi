Welp you're gonna be posting this forever
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:00
It's literally back to its completely normal price 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:14
Nobody is trying to take btc down. Take your tinfoil hat off
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:54
Check Coinbase, it's $3k
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:07
It was only at $8500 on Coinbase, and you can't buy bch on Coinbase yet. So firm what I understand nobody was able to buy at 8500
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:35
Well you can't buy bch with either, so the price on the sites doesn't matter too much
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:03
Take your tinfoil hat off
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:19
Take your tinfoil hat off
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:16
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:59
It's gonna go back to its 3k value in a day or two, and btc will not be harmed. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:58
The BTC price went back to its normal price. Coinbase is completely fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:28:28
Exchange trading happens off the block, so no fees and it's basically instant 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:38:26
I'm hoping by to find a fix other than this so I don't have to lose my jailbreak 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:50
Btc is at $17k
Bch is at $3.2k
Normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:50
It's already back to its normal price. Is your tinfoil hat still on?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:29:42
I understand it's my own risk. Why should I be using tor though?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:26:28
I don't have any money in the wallet, I just want to use it I. The future. I've tried reinstalling so I'll restart my phone now.
Update: 
Deleted the app, restarted my phone, reinstalled the app. Same problem 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:49:01
Only invest what you can afford to lose. That being said, the chances of bitcoin just flopping overnight are very low, so it's not a huge risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:30
No one can buy it bc it just got added. It went up 200% because of popularity since Coinbase added it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:37
I have no money invested in bch. Only BTC and LTC. Bch has been at around $2-3k for over a month now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:00
Not yet. The price skyrocketed bc Coinbase just added it. Give it a week and price will be back down to a reasonable amount. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:49:59
Unless your putting over $500 in I would just keep your money in Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:47
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:04:04
Binance you can use PayPal?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:06:32
Can I buy from binance with a cc?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:33
I doubt it will drop to 2k, but I'm not a time traveler. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:11:59
Tried making a GDAX account with my Coinbase account and I don't think I'll be able to since I don't have a SSN to enter. Any other suggestions?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:04:49
I'd rather buy from an exchange online so there's no fees and it's easier. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:16:09
From what I understand bitcoin cash is more like PayPal, how there's very low fees and sending time is faster. But, regular bitcoin or BTC has exploded in price and is still growing way more rapidly than bitcoin cash 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:50:10
Bitcoin was at $2500 this summer aswell. It's natural for the price to increase.  Also, who would investigate it for market manipulation, and how would they conduct such investigation?
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:06:48
Let me just pay $40 in fees so I can donate $5 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:30:12
Invest all that you can afford to lose, and just hodl until the 23rd century 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:26
Another crypto currency got added. So what?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:32:15
Most transactions are a mere couple bytes so throttling can't effect it much. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:12
I didn't even buy bch lmao. The world is not over because of a new crypto being added to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:10
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:20:32
Coinbase is completely fine. Take your tinfoil hat off
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:43
The "community" doesn't want it because r/btc hates bitcoin core, and r/bitcoin hates bitcoin cash. It's not a big deal. Coinbase isn't just a core exchange anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:47
Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:23:39
It says I have to complete my account to start trading aka entering ssn and address info 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:12
It's not confusing at all. It's just another cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:04:05
What do you mean by GDAX? Sorry I'm new to crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:18:40
Is there a way to send bitcoins to GDAX without confirming your identity? I don't have a SSN so can't confirm it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:00:23
Yeah, like everyone does. I can still transfer all my crypto out of Coinbase to another wallet, I just need a new exchange to buy from in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:29
Price spiked went it got added to Coinbase. It's back down now
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:03
Coinbase had 3 communities, now 4 to satisfy, not just r/bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:43:28
Ah thanks anyways
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:17:06
I'm a filthy noob and casual at this. Say I'm not paying for electricity, how long would it take to pay off the asic card?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:22:10
Used a credit card so it was instant. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:38:32
So what upgrades would maximize the profitability?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:18:46
Mining can ruin your PC?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:18:02
I'm not really in this for pure money, I'm kinda just doing it for fun and to see where I can go with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:26:32
Ah smart play
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:01:03
I wish it was 50 BTC haha 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:23:47
I got $48 worth of a $50 deposit, so not bad at all imo
