Bitcoin can be used for whatever it can be used for. Customs in my country have some 30% of opend packages containing "imported" perscription drugs, mostly anabolic steroides which are being cracked down on by police as it's mostly distributed by organised gangs.
Sure there are morally defendeble uses for such a service, but if customs discovers that they are opening packages from vendors who's shipment have not been triggerd by a VISA purchase, they will notice.
My point is not to discurrange any kind of business, it's that hopefully the growth of black market uses of bitcoin is proportionally less than the total growth.
We risk that any business handling Bitcoin will have their bank accounts terminated, which will hurt everybody.

People are actually not buying now. The price is held for days with big walls to fill up the buy side of the order book. Then someone buys 40-70K Bitcoins in one go. Every time the walls are lifted and there is no single big buy, we see an accellerating firesale until it's stopped with another buy wall.

As a decentralised currency Bitcoin have to have a finite number of coins possible in circulation to conserve trust. It's hard to make an inflatory currency that hostile parties would trust as an honest accounting system for transactions. Ripple has that achilles heal and so does government currencies and bonds. You are still right that a fixed supply currency promote hoarding, but mining is actually a taxation built into the system that we all pay on each transaction. So the miners collect the taxes in the Bitcoin eco system, but they are also the biggest spenders so in a sense they serve the role of government. That's of course a voluntary tax on spending but not spending any coins hurt the price which is comparable to inflation! This property to Bitcoin leads to price cycles but not very severe ones. The wild swings we are experiencing now has to do with most of the economy is being valued against the Dollar i.e. most people value Bitcoin based on how many Dollars it's worth, so any fluctuations make them feel they are loosing money at this stage in adoptation. Bitcoin is now mostly viewed as a commodity not a currency, that is gonna change too!

I read the ECB paper when it was released in October. Further the paper speculates that there could be a rush to Bitcoin if there are more "f... ups" by European banks.
The Bloomberg article is not a response to any recent development regarding this, but extrapolates on a scenario where the collective of the worlds central banks proclaim war against Bitcoin.
Such a move would be rather unlikely, launching a FUD campaign from political channels is more likely in my opinion.

So Ripple is in reality a debt based currency? Thats impossible to outlaw, without outlawing private loans.
Likewise, two parties can agree to owe each other $1.000.000 and then sell their debt for Bitcoin.
We hate banks for exactly that reason. Why should we help you become a bank?
Do anyone here have historical knowledge of any debt ponzies? It would work like regular ponzie, but instead of investing in something, you pay someone elses debt to get the right to create more debt. The ponzi artist would take on a loan in a regular bank and then offer payoff slots through Ripple. The payees would get a right to create more debt within the local trusted Ripple ponzie circle. He would not technically be taking anybodys money, thus being liable for any assets, likewise he would not have to pay taxes as the ponzy don't generate money but debt (It might even be deductable for all participants). So where is the crime? The best part is that he doesn't need to hang around untill the ponzie falls apart, but can leave for the Bahamas as soon his bank loan is paid back.

My suggestion to you is to hedge. Sell some of it according to your hunch. and don't try to buy  during a crash, wait for it to stabilize after a drop before you buy back in. Leave some BTC there also if it is @ £50 tomorrow. 
Be more laid back, you'll sleep better. If you are 50/50, your jackpot will be half but your risk is less than 50% as you have some money to buy for, on the right side of the price, so you will make money on every swing.

The graphs only consider the consumer ASIC's. At least two other manufacturers are involved in private mining operations.
Depending on their success, extrapolating the graphs beyond March is serious guessing. We might have 50% or less in return for Avalon miners when spring comes.

If they still are the same company, your claim is still valid and they should still have your money or bitcoins.

No she didn't, but making the personal liberty choice of drugs comparable to the liberty point of Bitcoin is just exposure to the same counter arguments which does'nt promote bitcoin in a beneficial way.
How many legitimate businesses watching Fox financial consider jumping in after watching this?

You could some time ago, and MtGox would lock down until it cancelled the customers unfunded order. Maybe it was a trick that worked I don't know. They have fixed it however so all pending orders are checked before being put in the orderbook.
This means longer pending time for everybody but rather that than trading being suspended for minutes.

Thanks, I suspect that too, but I had to ask, just in case everyone was doing it, and I was the last to find out!

Ask the germans how that is going in Germany. I would think you'd get arrested for peddling or running a street racket.

Bold move, but that is a red cloth waved in front of government. If they are discrete about it, fine. If this is a story that ends in mainstream media, we will have politicians obliged to start a debate.
This can of course backfire and be the best advertising possible, but no need to test that right now.

I like the lower graph: where you can see the changes in the orderbook. Wall movements and buying selling pressure are very easy to spot.
Clarkmoody is invaluable too for the overall look and I hope he soon get  running which will have point n click trading and scripting to setup rules for stoploss and other stuff.

It's a currency not a stock, the market decides if mBTC becomes the defacto. Merchants would start showing prices in mBTC, there could be an option to show price in trading platforms in mBTC. If it gets widespread, it would be the new standard.

The Bitcoin learning curve; they are asking the same question all of us did when we first heard about Bitcoin. In a week or two, they will have figured out how fake real money is!
@_date: 2013-01-18 18:02:58
Your argument is right, Government controlled currency is not free, as in free markets, but private monopolies are'nt either. How do you explain that the banks won't play along now, after the bailouts, and loosen up their lending? Government do not have the power to end resession, banking have. When enough is bought up at a Cent to the Dollar, lending and thus money supply will increase to start the cycle again.

They are really trying, but I would imagine that they still are weeks away for starting the production and more so, a slick production line.

About the "deflationary problem":
For a decentralised currency, as Bitcoin, to work, it needs to be deflationary otherwise there would be an incentment for a miner, or a group of miners to corner the mining business, as they would be guaranteed a steady income forever, if they had enough hashing power to exclude competition.
If mining becomes monopolised, Bitcoin will break, so if you like an open P2P currency, it need to have a forever disminishing mining return. Even a fixed miners revenue but with variable difficulty, would risk getting overrun by technology advances or one heavy investor in mining gear.

You can claim that the Gem has advertising value, as the hype about it promotes the current owner name which can be any text you want. Maybe one of the future owners don't mind being stuck with it for a month, as it's free advertising?
Selling the site is kind of pointless as the value of the domain is locked to who owns the gem.

We need to either to have more Bitcoin vendors in the real world to keep up with demand or have a price that reflects demand more closely.

It looks like a quality board; beefy powersupply components and a lot of noise suppression.
They have put a lot of work in that design, regarding reliability = overclock able?
So considered the time used in development not all of it has been stalling tactics.
Nice PCB BFL!

This reminds me of the beginning of e-commerce when CC paymnet became mainstream.
The discussion about web shops commercializing the internet and leading to regulation in the 90'ies became the hell we know today where credit cards are neither easy or safe to use together with a heavily regulated internet.
This is the exactly same process happening now to Bitcoin. I'm not a pessimist, get ready for the "dot coin bubble".
