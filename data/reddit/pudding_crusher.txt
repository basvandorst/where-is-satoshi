They didn’t launder money in 2008 or sell drugs.
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:08:34
18 months.
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:48:47
Fuck off wanker
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:08:52
Do you think before you type? Bitcoin is accepted nowhere as a payment system or transfer money.
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:06:09
You forgot to mention that everyone will accept Libra.
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:13:25
 Buy stuff and services on the internet or through your phone and send money ? Eliminating bank fees when sending money and eliminating FX when going abroad.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:27:35
I’m not going to miss anything. I’m just not delusional about it.
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:00:03
Ok. so bringing up 2008 had nothing to do with anything. Thanks for the acknowledgment.
@_date: 2019-11-06 20:38:40
He forgot to mention 3rd world country with no extradition treaty.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:41:40
He already mentioned that he isn’t.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:54:02
Then just put the money in bank vault. Problem solved.
@_date: 2019-11-06 20:45:36
He forgot to mention 3rd world country with no extradition treaty.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:23:17
You’d make more money working at Walmart and just buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:04:34
How could they lend out your money without doing fractional reserve ?
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:27:09
Belgium doesn’t tax capital gains and they are not considered as income.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:25:12
This guy noobs.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:13:10
How would the bank lend any money in that case ?
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:39:24
They’ll be able to trace it to his account as he buys through  coinbase.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:29:29
Dude, your playing with $500. That’s just like playing with a virtual account. Once, the stakes are higher, you won’t be able to trade the same way.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:45:30
Yeah so what ? There’s no point in the bank keeping the billion dollars. They pay you an interest rate and loan it at a higher one.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:58:23
Yeah but if you eliminate fractional reserve, this isn’t possible anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-02 21:56:13
If it’s physical and they do fractional reserve, they won’t be able to give you your money anyway in the case of a bank run.
@_date: 2019-11-02 21:06:47
The fact that it’s a piece of paper in vault or digital makes no difference.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:47:25
He already mentioned he’s not using a VPN too. So if they wanted, they could tie this all together pretty easily.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:36:58
The dude just sounds like an idiot.
@_date: 2019-11-01 15:12:57
Why stop at 8k ? I want it to back to $100 to accumulate.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:36:30
I don’t know what’s your point in reference to doing fractional reserves.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:40:39
The IRS or his government tax agency
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:59:52
It is, it has revenue with insane growth and probably have a roadmap to profitability. But I agree startups are more speculative than blue chips, therefore the volatility.
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:23:30
When it actually works ?
@_date: 2019-02-22 17:09:39
Who said I don’t have any. You’re delusional. There won’t be a another wave because btc is a useless piece of shit with no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:05:04
It isn’t investing.
@_date: 2019-02-24 11:44:32
Your answer will probably be because no one is willing to buy your load of crap.
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:32:47
No one ever said that buying a car was an investment. It’s just a way to waste your money to show how small your dick isn’t.
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:31:04
But if another crypto takes over, than you are nowhere 
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:35:26
Btc doesn’t have any fundamentals, it’s useless in its current form.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:02:17
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:35:25
Based on fundamental analysis.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:58:10
You would if banks started applying negative interest rates.
@_date: 2019-12-12 15:48:06
You’re free to get rich.
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:14:31
 That’s because they buy jewellery with exceptional gems you moron.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:34:59
He sold drugs on the intarnet.
@_date: 2018-11-09 05:58:02
You think you’re still going to be alive when all of this blows up ? 
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:04:31
Haha, you think “money” can’t survive another recession ?!!??
@_date: 2018-11-10 06:18:33
If money isn’t worth anything, nobody’s going to want internet money. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:57:42
A rock is durable and doesn't corrode.
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:31:13
Thinking bitcoin can survive a USA/Europe ban and on top of that believing that it would be good for bitcoin is mental retardation. Bitcoin hasn’t been going anywhere for years although it isn’t banned.
@_date: 2019-09-30 22:23:07
Yeah, lightning is only 18 months away!
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:44:24
Delusion is a strong force.
@_date: 2019-09-14 15:40:23
Being invested in crypto doesn’t shape my views. Edit : i meant speculating
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:25:43
Method of exchange ? Haha, not anymore.
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:11:06
They didn’t really try. Did they ban exchanges. impose banking regulations banning crypto money, did they fine anyone or throw people in jail ?
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:32:04
A legal merchant accepting directly bitcoin ? Not really.
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:47:17
There is no point for it to survive if it is useless.
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:03:52
Great plan. So living in third world country and you would be unable to use any bank which transacts in USD.
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:11:55
But they can make it useless and worthless.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:20:44
But BTC's DNA doesn't look like bitcoin's DNA in the white paper. BCH does.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:08:25
What false information?
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:13:20
Tickers and names are just conventions. Nobody owns them. One keeps the spirit of Satoshi's white paper, the other doesn't. So let's fight for the name and may the best one win.
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:51:59
You know the US could make almost every bank in the world block inflow and outflows of money to exchanges . Done
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:03:47
You gotta talk about the real bitcoin on here.
