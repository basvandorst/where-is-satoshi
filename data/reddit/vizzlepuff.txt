Haha seriously, I have been wanting to see The Rise &amp; Rise for so long now! Why can't we watch it!?

This is extremely upsetting. I certainly don't have transaction volumes larger than 5 BTC but I feel like this is only the beginning. Invoice for your mining equipment? WTF, seriously!? I bought mine with cash on Craigslist, never thought of getting an invoice...

The Bitcoin network is still usually below its maximum transaction processing rate so 0 fee, low value transactions are still getting processed due to the fact that no alternative transaction choices are available. You can somewhat tell the probability of a free transaction going through by looking at the current transaction rate.

I am very fond of Xapo for this very reason. If a hacker somehow gets my username, password, pin, vault password, 2FA, and email confirmation, they still won't be able to get the funds for at least 24 hours. I would notice the SMS and email that they send and would be able to stop the withdraw before it occurs. This is about as near-perfect client side security as possible... BUT unfortunately, just like Coinbase, they hold your private keys and therefore can run off with your funds anytime. 
Both companies do have 10s of millions of dollars of venture capital suggesting they are legit and are here to stay but you can never be sure. I wish I could run Xapo's system on my own server. Now that would be ultimate!

It is a fallacy to assume that if money has not been stolen, the address has not been compromised. It is very possible that the malware waits until the balance is higher even though it can currently steal a small amount. When someone thinks an address is secure, they are likely to keep pouring more money into it and malware can exploit this fact.

Interesting story but the title is deceptive. Every country could actually use Bitcoin.

I believe this is what you are looking for:

To lessen the impact of rubber-hose cryptanalysis, you should, first of all, never publicly reveal how much bitcoin you have. Store your coins in different addresses and different locations (even if you want to be lazy and use the same password for all of them).
Wallet apps should also have multiple acceptable passwords that will unlock them where each password opens a different account. One should be a decoy account with only a small amount of bitcoin in it so it appears that you unlocked the wallet when really you have not.

I would not be surprised if this law was a major reason that Apple removed Bitcoin apps. Technically, even with their policy change (assuming they are talking about Bitcoin), Bitcoin apps don't comply with the law in California and therefore will not be approved until this law changes.

When the time comes that Apple can no longer ignore Bitcoin , I bet they will simply make their own Bitcoin payment services but Google will be first to do this...

Serious, I don't see Coinbase ever releasing market prediction software. That would be a bad move for them in so many ways. They do, of course, use market prediction internally; this is how the Coinbase price is determined (since they are not an exchange)

For some reason CoinDesk has removed their article about this even though the tweet about it still exists

Both the alpaca sock dealer and the um terrorism dealer will end up getting their coin either way. They won't particularly care where the coin came from. This is just like how someone with a dollar bill shouldn't have to worry about that bill's history or its future after it leaves their hand.

I think that bitcoin wallets apps should have a feature where two different passcodes will both unlock the wallet but one of the passcodes shows a decoy account with only a small percentage of your funds. Sending funds from the decoy account should trigger a silent alert as well.

Awesome! Love that I can support 50 Cent without spending a single cent!

Okay so use Coinbase if you can't handle that. We are talking about GitHub here so being a Linux geek is the norm. Besides that, retaining access to private source code repositories is not some casual thing that GitHub customers will take lightly. Bitcoin-paying developers aren't just going to forget (at least not for very long) to pay their GitHub bill. They will correct the problem the first time they are unable use their repositories.

Well Circle isn't even a BTC wallet. It's a digital wallet for fiat currency that then uses the Bitcoin network for transactions. The lack of walletility in Circle accounts will be a big downfall for the service as Circle users watch the BTC price go higher and higher, leaving them behind.

GHash.io is a problem because of CEX.io. CEX.io is huge because it is the last remaining small chance of getting some kind of ROI for the small scale miner. 
I would bet that most of the miners don't even realize how much they are helping degrade the integrity of the Bitcoin network. 
What would solve this situation is if CEX had a competitor. It seems somewhat obvious that CEX is making a lot of money, I am surprised one doesn't already exist.

A shorter block time would be much cooler than a larger block size. I hope this happens. 10 minutes is unnecessarily long.
