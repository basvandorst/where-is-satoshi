Would the coinbase usd wallet work for you?

It should be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than western union. Which imo crypto currency's best use case is sending money from county to country.

How do you prevent me from selling the same thing twice?

If 5 years are people going to look back at this time and say the same things we're saying when BTC is 10k a coin?

That's about the best case for personal mining. Bitcoin not attached to your name or drivers license.

I moved to WNY a few months ago, Bittrex works fine.  They have the bitlicense.  I also think their HQ is in NY.

Bitcoin isn't trademarked and you're making the original chain supporters look like idiots.
People like you and the censorship in this sub are what cause people to run to the btc subreddit.

Getting rid of the trollbox has a big red flag for me.  I liked their charts and night mode, but I thought I was gonna get gox'd.
Since I've used Bittrex, their charts blow goats so I've been doing everything thru Coinigy, I really like their interface.

I did too until this BCH thing came about, my concern is it confuses people coming into the cryptosphere and makes it pretty unappealing.
I wouldn't have that big of a problem if there was actual technical discussion on making this thing scale, but it's just petty memes.

I think you're spot on about ETF's.  However, I don't think the folks trying to manipulate the price want to advertise how easy of a market this is manipulate, so I still think there are people with bad intentions capitalizing on this opportunity.

Good news is SV and ABC are crashing harder.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:07:12
I don't believe a thing that guy says.
I think this entire fiasco has exposed him for the fraud that he is.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:47:47
Let's look at volume, 1/3 of volume is coming from the derivatives market, not the spot market.  The top market is BTC/USD on Bitmex at $3.5 Billion, 2nd highest market on Liquid with BTC/JPY with a 24 hour volume of 2.77% compared to Bitmex's 34%.
Big money is driving this price down, not "hodlr's selling," if you get out now you'll be kicking your ass in the future.  Just chill out and if you have the fiat available, dollar cost average down.  Oh, and DON'T BUY SHIT COINS!!  They will drop faster and not recover as quickly as BTC, the peasants follow the king.

[But at least you don't own 1 million of $BCH, are selling your products at a loss, had your new products fail, are trying to do an IPO and had to spend extra money to fight a hashwar with your former BFF, right?
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:09:23
Big money is big because they're smart investors, I don't think selling at this price on the spot market is a smart move.  I could be wrong and we could be crashing to zero.
The easiest way to explain what happens on Bitmex is you're not directly buying coins like on coinbase.  You're making a bet on if the price is going to go up or down, you can leverage that bet and increase your risk and profit.  
Bitmex is the wildwest, no verification which means you could get away without reporting your earnings to the fed's.  
Here's an article explaining how it works:

That's the plan, stan.

It's fun to dream though. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:15:44
In the spot market, but 42% of the trading volume is on bitmex.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:49:25
Please no.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:34:16
Their report analyzed 5-8% of what they consider "whales" and 1/3 of what they analyzed includes dormant wallets and criminals, those are not market movers.  So they truly looked at somewheres around 3-5 percent of wallets.  
It's easy to manipulate price, especially when 1/3 of that volume is derivatives with few real coins changing hands.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:41:02
I think this SV/ABC drama is just being used as an excuse by the whales to drive the price down so they can accumulate. I think whales don't want to hurt the chances of an ETF being approved so they took this opportunity where it's harder to prove market manipulation is occurring. Obviously bcash drama isn't going to win the hearts and minds of the SEC folks, but this drama is out of the whales hands so they might as well take advantage of this opportunity.

[The Bitcoin Gold fork is projected to take place on October 23rd. Information about this fork has been limited and there are concerns about its security and stability. As a result, we do not believe it is safe to allow support for Bitcoin Gold at this time. If the blockchain proves to be secure and valuable, Coinbase may choose to support it. At that point, your account will be credited with an amount of Bitcoin Gold equal to your Bitcoin (BTC) balance at the time of the fork.](

I don't think being asked a harmless question is that big of a deal. 
I think if he went on and made it into a door to door salesman call going on about how crypto is superior to the fake fiat you current accept. Then he would be that guy. 
But asking him if his store accepts bitcoin is not a "that guy" qualifier, IMO.

The gas station in my home town didn't carry worms for the longest time. After getting asked enough they started stocking crawlers and waxies.  They make money off the worms I buy and now I don't have to drive 12 miles to the next town to get my crawlers. 
Whenever I'm out of town I make it a point to go to a bar that accepts crypto. I would probably do the same for a gas station. I know I'm not the only one that thinks this way. You don't know the demand is there if no one asks. 
I think gas station clerk's tolerance are quite a bit higher than you think. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:18:20
I worked at a gas station back in the day, I was never annoyed when a customer asked if we take checks. 
It's a lot easier to ask the cashier than play "Where's Waldo"  with an amex logo. 
If you get annoyed by a customer asking you what forms of payment your store accepts you should find another line of work.

Yep, submit the change request for patching even if it gets denied, your ass will be covered atleast.

@_date: 2018-04-22 23:04:59
It's not annoying when someone is trying to give you their money. 
It's no different than asking if they take American Express, if I was a merchant who didn't take amex and people kept asking me if I took it, I'd probably look into how to take it.

That is true. I try not to think like that though. If I did I'd be regreting every purchase I've ever made.
