I was providing USD liquidity, but pulled out all of it a couple days ago, as the rates were nowhere near what I could get using my coins elsewhere. How many BTC do you have loaned out?
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:28:07
I think I should make one of these.
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:29:35
To be fair though, I'll bet you don't have much if any coins in gox. You would be singing a different tune if you had a couple hundred BTC in there.
@_date: 2012-12-04 03:26:31
Saw this in another sub; I'm starting with bitcoins today because of this! Here's to hoping I win :)

To be fair, it sounds like he covered his tracks at least pretty well; they had to go back several years to find a slip-up.  And they've probably been after him for a long time.
I do totally agree about moving out of the country though.  You can't hide forever in this country.  Our paramilitary police will get you sooner or later.

If funds were stolen off an airgapped computer you might have some credibility, but there's no excuse for leaving a cold wallet on a networked machine.

Yeah, the internal renderer is a bit dated at this point.  Have you considered rendering on multiple computers that you own, rather than buying a new GPU?
@_date: 2013-07-14 14:05:21
Turns out you were absolutely correct about the wallet.dat files, my recollection of how they work was off.
As for the hacking, I was going to say that the site isn't that popular, but if you're dutch I suppose it is :).  I wouldn't call this hacking though; it sounds like the got access (either through SE or phishing are my guesses) to the CMS and just logged in and added some js.
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:19:54
I know this has been said, but this is ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-07-15 10:39:58
Other than having to go through SLL, my experience was pretty good, I had to wait less than 24 hours to withdraw each time.
@_date: 2013-01-01 22:15:57
the price would be higher as the quality of the shirts increases- would you be ok with that?
@_date: 2013-07-14 14:10:17
Trust me, I know all about rooting, both my phone and tablet are rooted.  I'm still unsure how rooting makes you more secure though.
As for the iPhone backdoor, the first google result (for me) is from 2010, and the others appear to be about how apple is complying with LE requests to decrypt data.  A search for [android backdoor]( returns many more results on actual malware and security holes.
I'll be the first one to say that android is better than iOS, but it has flaws too.
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:51:13
One of the downsides of bitcoins being more popular is the lower barrier of entry for new people.  It used to be that you had to have a firm grasp of how they worked to be part of the community, but now, anybody can just follow a guide.

If he wasn't making money off the site, and got offered some amount of money to move it to another domain, why wouldn't he?
@_date: 2013-07-14 21:30:12
I don't believe that for a second.  Do I think what he did was irresponsible?  Of course, doing something like that is obviously not a good decision.  But do I think it was malicious?  Absolutely not.
@_date: 2013-07-14 13:49:37
A couple of points I think you should correct:


While this sometimes is true, they are very different things.  I would say it's possible, not likely.


Remember, just the wallet files don't do them any good.  They also need your private key(s).


Depending on your definition of big, this isn't really true.  Almost all of the instances of hacking "big" websites have resulted in just stealing data.  Changing production code is VERY difficult, at least for the big players.

would you be willing to pay around $20.00 for a nice shirt?
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:25:24
15 minutes in, 4 puzzles down.  The empty chest made me sad though :(
@_date: 2013-07-15 01:38:45
There is a way to get bitcoins through Virwox if you have a verified paypal.  I'm not sure if this works in the UK though.
@_date: 2013-01-01 22:52:55
Making them myself isn't something I have the ability to do at the moment.  Thanks for the info though :)
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:32:20
how much did you pay for the electricity this used?
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:50:28
What do you use for modeling?  And have you considered using a render farm?
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:28:16
How does that help you?
@_date: 2013-01-01 22:53:23
well I suppose I could email the guys who run the sites and ask them for permission, but unless I get it, I don't think I can create those.
@_date: 2013-01-29 14:00:02
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-06-29 01:04:08
The people saying it should be 'has' are correct.  If you think of how you would diagram it, "A quarter" is the subject and "has heard" is the predicate.  "Of US consumers" modifies "A quarter" and thus its conjugated correctly.

I love your art; if I wasn't a student and actually had some money, I would buy some!
@_date: 2013-03-15 10:59:01
So assuming 2.5 watts, that's like 180 watt hours.

Given that DPR seems pretty smart, that seems like a very likely possibility.  With the amount of money he has a gamble like that would be a pretty good chance to take.

Enjoy node, it really is fun to use!
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:43:44
Ah see I often forget about issues like these because I have a nexus 4 running stock.  Yes, I would definitely agree that the biggest benefit from rooting is the ability to install custom ROMs.  For somebody with the GS4, rooting and installing CM is a huge benefit.  For me though, it's only a small upgrade.  Great points.
@_date: 2013-07-14 14:00:10
Alright, I stand corrected then.  You learn something new every day!
My other points still stand though.
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:54:59
I'm just going to say congrats.  I don't want to know how much it cost.
@_date: 2013-07-14 13:51:14
If anything, rooting your phone makes it less secure, because you could potentially give an app with a vulnerability root.  Also, macs are not known for their backdoors.  What gives you that idea?
@_date: 2013-07-11 03:04:37
Here are my immediate thoughts:
* Getting people to trust you is going to be very difficult.  On the other hand, ff you don't ask them to pay up front, you're putting yourself in a very risky situation.
* If you're writing you own app(?) you need to find out what's involved with that.  It's not nearly as easy as people assume.
* I see no reason why people would use this.  Don't take this personally, but with services like shoprunner, why would people want an extra step of going through bitcoin?
Keep in mind, these are just first impressions.  I'd love to hear your responses :)

Where can you get shirts screen printed for 8 dollars? if you dont mind me asking.
@_date: 2013-01-01 20:50:24
so $20.00 is too expensive? sadly, this is what I would most likely have to charge to even get a $0.50 commission on each shirt.
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:49:04
That's crazy, I did it in elementary school and it's actually been the most helpful thing grammar-wise I've ever done.  I don't even have to think about it anymore, I just do them in my head if I'm confused.
@_date: 2013-07-27 13:31:14
How much capital did you have when starting?
@_date: 2013-06-29 01:06:03
Well yes, but more accurately, if we assume "majority" means &gt;50%, then most people who have heard of bitcoin trust it.  3/4 of consumers can't trust it because they've never heard of it.
