209 entries, isn't that like ~$4?

Nope, its just a few weirdos here and on bctalk.  Which I guess people could learn from (and relax?). It appears you *can't* arbitrarily rename a competitors product to try and marginalise them.

Holy crap, that kind of ruins my carefully constructed treatise on commissions.  But thanks for enlightening me.  I had no idea an exchange could operate on such a model - how do they pay for their operating costs?

Personally, I agree that its "Bitcoin" and not "Bitcoin Core".  
However, I FTFY:




Also important to note is how and where this silly name-appropriation tussle began; a single post by Theymos on bitcointalk.  (People in glasshouses, etc...)
*Cue downvotes/insults/banning for speaking the truth on in 3... 2... 1...*

Thanks for the heads up - maybe I'm out of date in that respect.  I only tried it once a long time ago because I needed to download one file from one person. Back then, the only way was to install a local app, which then kept bugging me all the time, slowed down my system, and left me with no way to keep it out of the menu bar so I had to look at it's distracting blue logo constantly (everything else in the default mac menu bar is black &amp; white).  Removing the app completely was a rigmarole with more heads of the hydra popping up everywhere.  And I had to go through all this just to download ONE file from ONE person?  Terrible design in every respect.  Later revelations about how little dropbox was concerned with the privacy of it's users cemented my opinion.

I think you both messed up:
1) Chartnazi didn't need to deliver his/her/it's wisdom in an insulting way, that didn't initially provide any useful information: "3d pie chart? Seriously" How about: "Critique with no information? Seriously?"
2) The OP *should* give a shit about how to more truthfully represent data visually.  The OP's post was visually-represented data.
As to the overly-biased article linked to by Chartnazi (yes, I read it), pie charts can be useful with particular datasets, they are visually intuitive and pleasing for people who might not otherwise be interested enough to want to study the information, and they suit certain datasets well. They are specifically useful to convey such things as "heaps of this, and a few tiny bits of this", or "all the things are equal", or "one thing is half, the other seven things make up the other half in varying amounts" - and arguably do some of these in a way that is more quickly visually comprehended than, for example, a bar chart.  Imagine a data set with a hundred members, one holds the value "99", the other 99 hold the value "1" - a pie chart could show the data relationship accurately and efficiently, whereas a bar chart would look fucking stupid and visually over-represent the 99 members that hold the value "1".  Pie charts have a place.
3D *perspective* pie charts on the other hand are completely brain-dead and/or manipulative misrepresentations of information and should be banned precisely for the reasons Chartnazi and the otherwise-biased article have explained.  (And by stark contrast, 3D pie charts *without* perspective might just be regular pie charts with a bit of extrusion as "eye candy" - so it is important to note that not *all* 3D pie charts can be instantly assumed to be evil.)
So.  Let this be the end of the pie chart discussion, forever.

For those who don't get what Ethereum is, a good primer can be found [here](  It's not exactly ELI5 (it's aimed at developers), but the first few paragraphs come close.
TL;DR - "The Ethereum blockchain can be alternately described as a blockchain with a built-in programming language, or as a consensus-based globally executed virtual machine."

They appear to have ignored the most important expense - there's no mention of trading commissions in their [paper](  Maybe a little bit like calculating the cost of a roadtrip without including gas?
They used price data from OKCoin to simulate against, so let’s see what would happen if they actually traded this live on OKCoin.
First, for the sake of familiarity to most of us here, let’s convert the papers figures from CNY to USD (USD/CNY @ 6.25):
* Total profit (after 50 days):  $537.62
* Avg trade amount:  $604.96
* Total trade volume (2872 trades):  $1,737,445.12
Taking into account the OKCoin [fee schedule]( their systems trade volume would earn them 86,872 reward points, which grants them a trade commission rate of  0.16% per trade (VIP2 level).
If we assume perfect liquidity and no slippage for all 2872 trades (yeah, right - but for the purposes of illustration…), then to have physically executed these trades on OKCoin, they'd have had to pay a total of $2779.91 ($1,737,445.12 * 0.0016) in commissions.
Which would leave them $2242.29 in the hole ($537.62 profit minus $2779.92 commissions). 
That’s assuming perfect execution and liquidity on every single trade, and not including the cost of running a box for two months (possibly requiring geo-location), and any dev work to develop the system and maintain it.

Would so do this but I hate dropbox and refuse to use it. Are you thinking of implementing any other way to store files? mega?

Country adopts bitcoin. r/bitcoin's top comments are about the grammar. This is why we can't have... no, wait - should I have written "r/bitcoin's top comments", or "r/bitcoins' top comments"???

If it doesn't force me to install an annoying local app that is difficult to remove, I'm all for it!

OKCoin does have [trading fees]( my other comment describes their effect on the outcome.

So they curve-fitted as well? This is looking really bad.

Hmm.  Looks like we should increase it?  Hey I'm no expert, though.

I'm really dubious of this report. Here are four reasons:
1) The claims are too big. Accurately analysing over 1 million lines of code, in 8 different languages and 25 projects for this many vulnerabilities would be a huge undertaking. How could this have been done accurately without understanding the subtleties of each codebase? It seems highly likely they've used software to automate analysis - but you can run analysis software on code and turn up false-positives, errors that simply don't apply to your use case, etc - as much as you want. Unless you're intimately familiar with the codebase in question, it'd be difficult to configure such software to return applicable, trustworthy results.
2) Real-world results. In the case of Ripple for instance, it's been running as a distributed value exchange for four years, and hasn't had one instance of hacking, or even spam attacks. In terms of real-world experience, it seems to be one of the most secure, or at the very least, demonstrably less susceptible to attack than Ethereum for example, at least in the spam category.
3) The unclaimed prizes. Most of these projects involve value-exchange. In Ripple, there's a quarter billion dollars worth of motivation for someone to make money out of these "223" vulnerabilities, and they expect us to believe that hasn't happened even once?
4) If it's true, why not give the teams the chance to fix their code? If they truly believe their own claims, it's tremendously irresponsible not to contact the teams involved and provide them with the details of the exploits. To my knowledge, that has not occurred. To me that makes the authors either trustworthy and also a bunch of total a**holes, or just not trustworthy.
TL;DR - some untrustworthy people have misused code analysis software to make sensationalist claims.

It was intentional by the miners, to decrease the difficulty level and make mining more profitable, therefore leading to an increase in hash power and decrease block confirmation times.  It worked.

Remittance. Someone wants to transfer fiat to another country - urgently. This can of course happen for all kinds of reasons - especially in underbanked nations. Using a bank takes days and costs a lot.  Many people don't have bank accounts, or *can't* have bank accounts. It used to be the case that buying BTC with fiat, sending the BTC and selling it for fiat at the other end was a viable option, significantly faster and cheaper than using a bank, or cheaper, but not that much faster than Western Union.  Remittance is a half a trillion dollar a year market, and for a while BTC was positioning itself as a [serious contender]( to capture a large share of that market.  I personally used it for this purpose for the reasons described - for a good few years.  That's not the case at the moment.

Might you hold 10-20%% of your crypto net worth on exchanges if you traded regularly and made amounts comparable to that during the course of your trading?  For whales, that 10-20% may be seen as millions to everyone else, but to them its just a small amount of their net worth well-invested and regularly returning more than it would cost to lose it (should an exchange fail).
