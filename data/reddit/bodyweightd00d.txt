I'm expecting huge growth in Bitcoin the next few years.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:34:37
Our family has 2 Wirex cards, and neither of us use them.
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:38:56
How's it work out? Everything is now $5 in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:43:28
Haha, you're right.
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:43:28
Haha, you're right.
@_date: 2016-08-11 08:16:12
I appreciate his outlook and positivity. But yeah, possibly the worst dressed millionaire. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:35:08
What's the point to buying BFX with all the problems they're about to go through?
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:48:24
By 2017 or 2018? Do you think that happens?
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:56:31
What are the most trustworthy mobile wallets right now? 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:41:43
So CoPay is anonymous? They need nothing to setup a wallet, looks like.
@_date: 2016-08-31 22:12:57
I think it draws a lot of excitement. The Bitcoin situation here in China is going really well but a lot of people aren't aware of that. Plus, she interviewed a lot of people for it.
@_date: 2016-08-25 12:28:21
Incredible documentary. There needs to be more Bitcoin docs. Everybody I've shown this film has bought Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-17 04:52:05
The balance is with Shift or with Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-08-01 00:48:12
I haven't seen any articles about that. Is this something that will be resolved easily? Is there a problem with a miner running an alternative client?
@_date: 2016-08-28 12:32:17
I've had great help from their support in the past year, but still, it really depends on which department you're speaking with and which person from each department. Totally different experience. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 04:52:55
I messaged them on chat support and got it granted pretty easily a few months ago. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:02:35
I'll buy it at a pretty big discount. Not too big. But pretty big.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:06:46
Yeah, I imagine, haha.
@_date: 2016-08-01 00:25:33
Was that today or yesterday? What's the meeting about?
@_date: 2016-08-02 11:40:03
Why did ETH go up for a few days and look positive before this recent crash?
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:32:15
That's kind of how it works with most friends, haha
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:41:42
Haha, thanks. Let's make a deal to both buy tomorrow. Just because!
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:33:09
Yeah, I get that. Keep in mind the average savings account in Cali is less than $1,000. I think it'd be good for her to move at least half to BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:36:27
Nobody ever suggests Blocktrail but I love it. All the keys, looks great, and easy to use.
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:43:02
I think a mobile wallet would be nice!
@_date: 2016-08-25 06:05:03
Order me a pizza and I'll give you $10 BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:29:23
$2000-$3000. One Bitcoin expert said at he beginning of this year that Bitcoin in 2018 would be $4000.
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:30:03
Is the Jaxx interface better now? I downloaded it last year for ETH but deleted it. I think Blocktrail wins the award for best looking wallet. Gonna get CoPay now.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:20:05
We'll hold elsewhere. Apps like BlockTrail or CoPay so you hold the private keys and your Bitcoin is safe. Try Vaultoro or Trezor too.
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:57:35
Worked on a website last night. Not sure why Hopper declined it.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:28:49
Ah, damn. Yeah, I just figured there'd be so many more. I guess we all never have enough coins, haha.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:35:25
Because more and more people are adopting it everyday.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:01:57
So in your opinion, how do we recover from this? That's $160 per coin we've all lost this week.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:10:40
Already shot up quite a bit today. What do you think caused to to go up? All of us seeing the low number and buying? 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:14:19
Yeah. I knew it took 6 confirmations. Just never realized it took that long and I've used my card a lot. It's all good. Got it in 45ish minutes.
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:05:12
Best mobile wallet there is!
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:42:22
Their hosting gets slow once you start picking up real traffic. Be prepared.
@_date: 2016-08-01 00:02:15
Can someone explain the events that made this happen?
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:51:34
As am I. We're all I. This together. It's absolutely ridiculous that people's greedy bullshit is the main thing all holding us back. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:44:18
You use a card? What are your methods for spending Bitcoin on mostly everything?
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:49:50
I'm in China. Not sure why, but Breadwallet is super laggy.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:27:30
Just hold it.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:50:12
Is Copay a good one? Trustworthy? I also like Blocktrail.
@_date: 2016-08-31 11:21:40
That's Beijing and Timeout are probably the best English magazines in Beijing. Paper copies are free and can be found at most western places around the city. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:19:52
Those will be the days when most people can't afford to buy more than 1 coin at a time.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:32:14
Good idea. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 01:36:16
Link me to that sub, please.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:06:12
What events do you think need to happen for one Bitcoin to be worth $10,000?
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:58:25
Tell me a little bit about this news you speak of. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 07:22:03
Maybe a few months? Just speak to chat support and ask them. Naldo good to publicly ask questions on Twitter.
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:55:23
Makes sense to me if they don't have any. MOON.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:03:28
I just bought more now. This community is strong. Keep your heads up and keep buying. I do regret not buying at $490 yesterday.
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:57:13
I have a USD card and I'm worried about using it in the US next month.
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:34:37
Ugh. I'm never desperate for transactions, but at times like these...
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:56:21
Do they have insane fees?
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:27:29
Keep buying. The price has been going up consistently since the hack. And now, we lose another of the bad guys. Bitcoin will work. And way too many people believe in it. Plus, look at all the positivity in mainstream media right now.
@_date: 2016-08-13 05:12:18
What country are you in?
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:43:51
Expedia accepts Bitcoin still?
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:19:08
Sending you a private message.
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:01:37
Most Americans are broke robots.
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:35:53
1) Business expenses
2) Leads (Found a lead generation company that accepts Bitcoin)
3) a burger
4) 2 pizzas
5) case of Goose Island beer
I've been having friends pay for somethings and I just send them Bitcoin. Gets them into Bitcoin and I can keep less fiat. Win-win, if you ask me. 
Also: looking to get a expense tracking finance spreadsheet made if someone wants to earn some easy Bitcoin. Let me know!
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:43:03
Yes, I want this too!! Link us, please.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:41:42
Thanks for sharing that. I thought there would be way more people with $20 mil +. Guess everyone sold after Mt. Gox?
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:22:03
Hahahahah. Well, I definitely wish that. I have no idea how so many people complain about Coinbase yet people still hold everything there. I have less than $5 in my Coinbase account. Know what? I'm gonna go move that now.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:20:44
But why are you not worried?
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:15:25
I prefer to keep most of my funds in Bitcoin and not banks. I hate banks.
@_date: 2016-08-11 00:24:44
Buying is just part of the addiction, haha.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:03:32
Any exchange is fine to buy Bitcoin from. Just don't hold your Bitcoin there. But if you prefer to not have to give up all your identification, use Local Bitcoins and buy from someone on there. And get to chat Bitcoin with another believer!
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:12:07
It's been a rough few days, sure. But we can view it as a good thing. 
1) People will stop storing their Bitcoin on major exchanges. I really have no idea why people go through the route of learning Bitcoin, buying Bitcoin, and not safely storing.
2) Shit exchanges that don't properly store their Bitcoin will die. Bitfinex had no coins in cold storage. They were an easy target. We could even thank the hackers so other exchanges will properly organize their businesses.
This will just fade out the bad guys. And we can keep on going. Give it 30 days and we'll be at $800. Calling it now.
@_date: 2016-08-31 11:20:08
Me too! You live here?
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:04:29
Snoop Dogg also accepted Bitcoin back in the day. I want to hear more about celebrities that took up Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:53:24
$23,418. Will be in target for $35,422, my eoy price prediction.
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:31:18
Can you list them out in text for us to easily search? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-19 11:54:51
I'd rather $400 safe in my Bitcoin wallet over sitting in a goddamned bank.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:58:55
I said the lowest it would go is $917, not $971. Don't worry though.
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:36:16
It will stop at $917. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 06:54:34
Sure. Not a bad idea. I'd just like as little to do as possible. And hopefully get a commission. This is new to me!
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:02:01
Use a VPN. Or you can go and use a Bitcoin ATM. There are plenty in Japan!
@_date: 2017-02-19 11:51:01
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:37:53
By several, you mean two. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 10:25:53
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:40:49
Yep. Folks are still buying. Too many shit talkers on here...
@_date: 2017-02-10 07:09:03
Too racist. Plus the racial term "gook" refers to the Vietnamese, not Chinese. It's ok for you to be ignorant since Reddit is anonymous, but don't be stupid.
@_date: 2017-02-12 01:15:39
If you're in Tokyo you can head to Two Dogs Taproom. Good beers and food. Plus they have a BItcoin ATM!
@_date: 2017-02-24 10:50:31
Quit spreading FUD and get the fuck out of here.
@_date: 2017-02-12 04:14:51
There actually wasn't a high fee. I don't remember exactly, but I thanked the owner for not being greedy. I just bought 1000 yen worth to try it out and it was close to market price.
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:03:03
I say $10,000 now. Then $100/day for 65 days. Best of both worlds.
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:01:53
In the end we all win. Just buy when you can, live a good life, and don't stress. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:34:14
We're actually building a site to make Bitcoin easier to understand for beginners. It'll also help block out all the noob questions on this group!
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:35:16
Is Airbitz still good? I stopped using it when it didn't look as good as the other new wallets coming out.
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:49:51
Our startup accepts Bitcoin we give our clients a 10% discount if they pay in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:39:04
@_date: 2017-02-11 10:26:40
Wirex SUCKS. Use Xapo or BitPay. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:05:56
Segwit. Hardfork not needed.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:49:00
Hillary at Xapo is really sweet and helpful. They are technically a startup and they do get busy. Try sending them a private message on Twitter and you can get your issue request escalated. They'll solve it. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:26:07
Have you seen the way Roger Ver dresses? Maybe the world's worst dressed "millionaire".
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:33:00
Do they accept Americans living abroad?
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:55:16
Yep. Perfect. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:30:02
Met the founder of Purse recently. Really great guy that really cares about his biz. Have you used Purse before?
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:23:24
The currency on your Visa also fluctuates daily, the higher-ups just don't tell you because they think we're stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:09:56
FUD. People like you that scare away the newbies. We don't need you.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:04:31
I agree. This community should work closer together. Bitcoin is beautiful.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:53:49
You sent me the same chain response on another Kraken is BS post...
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:23:49
I just waited 8 days for a bank transfer to fund my account. Kraken support was barely there. And I won't be using them again.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:46:07
Didn't have the quote I'm looking for but still a great interview. Thanks for that!
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:42:34
I hate banks. But I hate PayPal even more. Stick with Bitcoin. And get a Xapo Visa card to spend your Bitcoin. Then say goodbye to banks and PayPal. And then BE YOUR OWN BANK.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:19:11
Kraken SUCKS. 8 days to fund my account. Nobody should use them. They're the worst exchange.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:57:32
Very sad for this community we all love. Some of these people are being too greedy.
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:56:42
I'm so sick and tired of people making videos in their cars. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:16:37
Bitcoin has been purchased and moved. I will not be using you again. That was a horrible experience and it's really not worth it. I'd rather just use Coinbase. And that's saying A LOT.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:51:13
Ah, ok. I'll watch the whole thing then. I thought he said that a couple years ago. This interview is from last week, right?
@_date: 2017-03-22 08:28:16
Everything's going to be fine. As Bitcoin gets bigger this will happen every few years.
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:20:57
At first, I thought the same thing because I just made a purchase. But then China devalued the yuan even more. And my Chinese Bitcoin group all said they were buying. So I stopped worrying and now look!!
@_date: 2016-06-02 11:05:09
Damn. So Apple Pay would be more like WeChat Wallet? Awesome. WeChat is a popular app we use in China for texting friends. Similar to Facebook as well. But WeChat Wallet allows us to have a balance with WeChat. We can send money to friends or pay for things at businesses. Really convenient. I can even buy BTC with some Chinese Local Bitcoiners. Very helpful.
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:23:45
Could just get a VPN. Safe to use one anyway these days, no matter where you are. I have a coupon code. Send me a PM, dude.
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:46:35
I'll try it out with a very small amount just to let everyone know.
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:26:27
I'm all for buying. The mining side is something that interests me. But I think I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.
@_date: 2016-06-12 11:16:07
That just means the worth of all the coins that have been purchased?
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:29:51
I agree. What percentage income is everyone investing into BTC right now? My goal is 70%.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:31:41
@_date: 2016-06-19 00:56:18
It's a good technology. I believe in it as well. Not everyone is selling. I was also a big purchaser of Vertcoin back in 2012...
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:53:34
I say we all buy one Bitcoin right now and start this push!!
@_date: 2016-06-18 04:07:30
Does Bovada accept Bitcoin now? You can definitely bet college baseball on Nitrogen Sports with Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-06-03 09:42:17
Yeah. It took me months to figure that out too, haha.
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:27:42
Well said. I think most of us buy more than we should, haha. 
Think of it this way. If this thing fails, the millions of people that bought in can just go start a commune somewhere. Get to the drawing board and start over!
@_date: 2016-06-13 01:42:34
Thanks, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2016-06-28 00:35:31
Welcome to the club!!
@_date: 2016-06-19 00:55:00
Yeah. More like copy them. And I don't think it would have anything to do with BTC. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 23:22:08
How much traffic does your site get? And how much did you earn? 
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:16:30
Yeah, just sent them an update that this machine is no longer working.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:58:08
I don't see that it fell that much. I still see $690. I went ahead and bought 2.5 more, haha. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:47:07
Just sign up for Circle. You can buy directly with your debit card. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:59:24
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:55:49
When in reality, the danger is everyone using it :D
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:41:54
Didn't expect this...
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:16:56
I've recently been getting a ton of errors on Local Bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:28:09
That's weird. They even have the US presidential election available to bet on!!
@_date: 2016-06-03 09:41:42
I think Circle's great. Much better than Coinbase. Reliable support. Good app. And I can send money to my American account in 4 days or less. I dig it.
@_date: 2016-06-30 03:11:21
I don't think Local Bitcoins is a sexy site though. Maybe one of the most dated sites.
@_date: 2016-06-03 13:32:26
Why do you think it hits $1000 by August?
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:12:50
Yeah, I wouldn't do it. Just learned of that recently. How into BTC are you?
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:54:17
So it needs to be a certain kind of ATM? How do I withdraw cash without a bank card?
@_date: 2016-06-19 00:26:04
I don't think anyone else plans to use them, right? For years, people and governments have talked shit about Bitcoin. Now its a perfect, "If you can beat'em, join them." situation.
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:21:15
Maybe I'll buy from you. Send me a PM.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:43:08
What do you mean by a flash crash?
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:29:36
What do you think it takes besides the halving to get to $1000?
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:42:53
I'm in Beijing. Would love to hear more!!
@_date: 2016-06-16 13:24:54
Go ahead and link me. I'd love to check them out. HaoBTC is also starting something similar. 
Can someone else go to the office? It's in the UK. I'm way out in Asia.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:59:02
Also: how can people set up bots to control Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:51:31
Do you think the hack is causing less people to buy?
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:29:29
Just got news from my Chinese friend that October could be rough for China. With the yuan, housing market, and stock market all taking hits, we can all only hope the Chinese keep buying after the halving.
@_date: 2016-06-03 13:33:24
Hahahahah. Good one.
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:30:44
They're featured in this article: 
Read it and let me know what you think.
@_date: 2016-06-19 08:59:18
How long have you been living bankless? What's your strategy?
@_date: 2016-06-25 00:56:59
Let's give it another 8 days. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:35:13
Yeah. I was told to buy Ethereum from there. Seemed like a bitch just to login. Even for the iPhone login, you need to approve it on your computer. Ugh.
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:02:50
We were close to $800. I thought we'd see $1,400 before the halving. That was just my prediction though.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:37:01
Damn. That's a brilliant idea. Have you used them before?
@_date: 2016-06-01 05:30:02
What's your startup?
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:23:19
Hahah. I mean how serious are you about investing these days? Are you still buyin as the price rises?
@_date: 2016-06-04 09:44:09
I see $591 right now!! I made a similar post yesterday, haha.
@_date: 2016-06-19 12:24:17
Is that you, Roger?
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:00:04
Seems we're stuck at $750 now which is better than $500.
@_date: 2016-06-05 12:29:09
Why Bread Wallet over Blocktrail or any of the other numerous wallets?
@_date: 2016-06-26 02:35:35
Lots of my friends have bought in as well!
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:21:49
I don't but I haven't looked. Have you tried this? Can I see some analytics? Does it work with Facebook marketing or only websites?
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:22:29
Ah, nice. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:09:10
Buy tomorrow. Hold it til 2022 and you'll probably be able to take a couple years off work.
@_date: 2016-06-28 00:19:58
Awesome. I'll check that out.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:44:57
So you're just staying with what you got for now?
@_date: 2016-06-05 11:22:27
Damn. That's amazing. And would've been helpful for me last year. 
The good news is today 1BTC will get you 580 bowls of Pho!
@_date: 2016-06-29 00:09:17
How much BTC did you earn?
@_date: 2016-06-21 04:44:56
My predictions are guesses.
@_date: 2016-06-01 22:42:25
I dig Xapo as well. Been using it everyday and it's been great. Big thing is it doesn't work on mobile card readers. My Xapo card failed on an airplane debit machine when trying to buy wine and it failed in a taxi once paying for a fare.
Mother than that though, Xapo's been great. I love the app too. Easy to manage funds and I get immediate notifications.
I'd much rather use Xapo over a bank. There are no hassles and I prefer to be my own bank.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:24:51
Were these all the comments? If not, I'd love to read more! Thanks.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:57:34
None of those services would allow me to accept a Visa transaction from a client and receive Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:50:36
Rumor is the PBOC will allow banks to go bankrupt now.
@_date: 2016-06-15 01:12:42
China has a ton of different social networks. I don't use many. Very dated websites, haha.
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:07:30
I imagine a. huge amount of Bitcoin will keep moving in China with all the gifts (Red Envelopes) that happen over Chinese New Year. BTCC is even doing some promotions here for CNY.
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:41:16
Don't make the Yuan any stronger though. And the Yuan will most likely be devalued again in a couple months, meaning the Chinese just lost way too much precious BTC over some FUD.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:44:40
Excellent, man. That makes me happy. I know most people just hodl. But I prefer to spend mine as well and am currently phasing out banks as well. The problem is most people in my area don't accept BTC, haha. Xapo helps though.
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:18:33
Both ATMs have been shutdown. I could probably buy your leftover RMB at the end of your trip. Send me a pm. And enjoy!
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:09:33
I absolutely hate holding a stack of worthless FIAT!!
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:38:11
My girlfriend is now also addicted to Bitcoin and I love her even more for it!!
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:44:06
Tweet support is great!!
@_date: 2016-06-01 22:39:57
Wirex is MasterCard :/
@_date: 2016-06-05 11:23:42
I think a Slack or Skype group would be helpful too if we can't create a carrot. How many of us constantly have thoughts/questions they'd like to discuss?
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:32:18
I get that. But I'd prefer to use Xapo or Bitpay over a bank or PayPal. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 14:32:07
My Xapo card has been great so far. On a trip in Spain and only using it. Gonna write a full review of it here soon.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:27:11
By Friday.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:12:39
Charge your phone or you won't see us hit $1,100 later today!!
@_date: 2017-01-10 10:48:34
Can an American open a German bank account online?
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:03:34
The top package they offer is $3700.
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:06:41
A lot of these exchanges have strict requirements. Might have to use Local Bitcoins. How much are you looking to buy?
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:21:33
Perfect! I've gotten many people involved as well. And this is what people need. Most people are too lazy to do so on their own anyway, haha.
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:57:21
Can an American open a WB21 from China? That'd be beautiful!
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:55:22
Low payouts...
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:51:34
The best thing is that we no longer have trolling big blockers whining about the greatest invention of all time.
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:30:32
Haha, yeah. My friend sold .33 Bitcoin yesterday. H freaked out. I told him it's ridiculous and all this FUD will one day be a huge regret from all these sellers.
@_date: 2016-06-16 02:59:57
I think the concept of cloud mining is really cool. But $3700 is way too big of an investment to not see results from. Especially when that could go to buying BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-11 08:05:47
Yeah, I submitted on the site. I'll send you a pm.
@_date: 2016-06-16 02:23:01
So it's definitely not worth it? Is most cloud mining just for the experience? That is an expensive investment to not even break even.
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:28:26
Owner is an awesome guy from Seattle. Told me all the Bitcoin guys that come in are the smartest people he knows, haha. I used the Bitcoin ATM too! Very small fees.
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:52:53
Circle= biggest Bitcoin losers
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:46:46
Great idea helping them with the remittance. What exchange are you using to buy 59 BTC at once?
@_date: 2017-01-14 09:53:36
$830ish now. I say we're at $850 by Monday.
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:28:26
8 days. I'll call it now.
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:29:02
Woo, you gotta. And be sure to check out the Baird Taproom at Harajuku. Also: there's a Brewdog Taproom nearby Two Dogs.
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:27:43
What happened to Changetip?
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:38:46
Nothing is happening. PBOC is only checking to make sure exchanges are following rules and regulatons. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 14:03:28
So Bread is just a phone app? 
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:04:10
Yeah. I second that. Too much good press still. I say at least $900 by next week. I heard an Australian news outlet is running a story on Bitcoin soon too!
@_date: 2016-06-02 12:46:08
Only links to Chinese debit cards now unfortunately. My Uber takes multiple cards in China. Depends on phone number for Uber.
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:25:19
I've been doing the same to feed the addiction. But I have a couple big buy days every week too, haha.
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:23:28
Just opened a WB21 account online. Thanks so much. PM me your wallet address and I'll tip you some Bitcoin. You saved the day!
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:16:50
$10,081 because in no specific order: Segwit. BCC's death. No Segwit 2x. Failing Chinese and Italian banks. Crumbling US stock market. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:44:13
I will gladly buy it from you. Send me a PM!!
@_date: 2017-01-08 10:01:17
Exactly. All the cloud mining sites look too shady. And mining is too expensive. Just to mine 0.1 Bitcoin a day would cost close to $20,000 to start. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:47:44
Not sure how you did it but it is a great idea!
@_date: 2017-01-09 11:19:24
How did they make a profit. It was a great idea.
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:25:01
So how can I buy Bitcoin with that account?
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:35:52
I'm not in the US. I live in China. Having some problems accepting payments from clients and recently closed my American account.
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:15:29
Satoshi has 500,000. Be positive!! 
@_date: 2016-06-29 08:04:44
How close to an economic collapse do you think we are?
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:00:57
Nah. Just wondering what people's plans are for now. I got asked the question yesterday. Guess I just plan to keep investing no matter the price. I know a few people are holding long term where as I'll buy and spend. I don't want to only hold. Some of my friends are into various alt coins at the moment too.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:58:40
Let's create this!! We could at least make some easy money partnering with Chinese exchanges, haha.
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:09:37
IT WON'T HAPPEN. SO DON'T WORRY.
@_date: 2017-01-01 08:59:41
Let me know what you think. That pale ale is great!
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:45:23
Awesome site! So the Visa payments your customers pay just go to your bank account?
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:34:25
I love the risk!!
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:44:28
Their support just sent me a registration number  and a companieshouse.gov.uk link. Also sent me their business office address.
@_date: 2016-11-13 13:43:57
Why not just build a cool site with it?
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:29:24
Xapo? Really?
@_date: 2016-12-23 09:09:59
My friend's company could definitely help you guys out if you ever need to transfer to Chinese Yuan. Check out their site:  They provide low fees and extremely quick transfers. Check'em out!
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:42:54
I don't want any USD though. I just want to make it easier for clients to pay.
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:30:06
$5,000- $20,000 by 2019. $50,000-$80,000 by 2025. $100,000-$500,000 by 2030. I bought 5 at $900 yesterday. I don't feel bad at all.
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:05:41
If I did that I'd feel really stupid once it hit $150,000.
@_date: 2016-12-21 13:53:14
My friend's company helps people like you!  You'd send him Bitcoin and he'd pay your supplier in RMB.
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:48:58
CIRCLE WENT TO SHIT.
They used to preach Bitcoin. Now they preach USD. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 04:29:27
Why was the link removed then?
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:19:25
Yes, this was my initial advice.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:36:39
Owning 3 Bitcoin over he next few years will put you in the upper bracket. Hold. Buy more. The real smartie pants will all own 21.
@_date: 2016-06-12 11:06:11
Don't really think they can. BTCC is the largest exchange. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:33:04
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:28:44
If it's at $1000 within 2 weeks you just lost a lot of money. Get out of here, traitor.
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:53:35
Can companies add their services? 
@_date: 2016-11-13 14:02:50
Could easily make some sort of biz helping people invest. Load it with good content and affiliate links. That'd be an easy $1000/month I imagine.
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:10:53
Best female in Bitcoin just left Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-27 04:10:57
People will trust this?
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:09:30
The US Election will prove it! I'll just wait here and hold. :D
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:05:57
Buy at the current price and go with the flow. Say it never hits $750 again. Then you're only missing out.
@_date: 2016-11-07 11:58:28
Yeah, I'd do that for clients paying in Bitcoin. But I also want an option to accept USD and then receive Bitcoin. I don't want USD.
@_date: 2017-01-18 02:24:02
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:33:43
It's gonna go back up shortly. The fun will start again soon. Let these guys finish getting rich and we'll play again.
@_date: 2018-06-10 11:28:57
Yep. Many common folks are willing to get raped by PayPal. Which makes sense. Because you can’t buy drugs or guns with PayPal. ����‍♂️����‍♂️
@_date: 2016-11-01 12:10:00
Will check this out. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:46:20
Planning on it! Should be next week.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:14:19
I spend Bitcoin almost everyday because I believe that's how it should be used. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:52:37
I gamble on NBA games occasionally. I have friends that play poker with Bitcoin.
I also have 2 companies that accept Bitcoin as payment from clients. 
There are tons of ways to earn "free" Bitcoin. These services are always a huge waste of time for minimal amounts of Bitcoin.
If you want to earn some serious cash, list a service of yours on r/jobsforbitcoin and see if it gains any interest. Send me a private message as well. My teams are always in need of freelancers for various tasks. Thanks, and welcome to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:46:03
Homework. Pretty much anything from the high school days.
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:44:44
Does that math in the last 12 months work?
@_date: 2016-06-11 08:05:20
I've been using Xapo everyday in Spain. I'll be writing a full review of my experiences with Xapo soon. But I wanted to make a video for my friends on how to use a Bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:09:03
I chose Xapo. I don't want to sell BTC to load a card. I load BTC on my Xapo card and spend it like any bank card. Writing a full review of my Xapo card this week. Just used it for 2 weeks in Spain and it was great!
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:33:07
I'm building a new website soon to help newbies learn Bitcoin. How to use it, why to use it, everything in one place.

He is a douchebag. But he's also very good at everything he does. Can't really hate on him.
@_date: 2016-11-02 14:46:32
November 3rd in the afternoon.
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:50:29
Agreed. How many active users are there now? Any estimates?
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:11:31
Learn Bitcoin. And learn where to safely store your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:38:25
Yes, but never sell!
@_date: 2016-11-25 19:15:16
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:45:07
Xapo is the same. Good customer support and app. I dig Xapo.
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:50:53
He’s selling it at a discount. And he’s a huge Bitcoiner. Just wants it to be the first craft brewery to be sold in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:19:30
A good portion is smart though. Would you rather have Bitcoin or the struggling Chinese Yuan right now? Lol
@_date: 2019-10-25 01:36:46
Which is why I’m asking you, my friend, how it works. How is it different from margin trading?
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:30:35
How are those numbers the support points? Can you explain please? Thx.
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:29:35
Well, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
@_date: 2019-10-25 04:11:36
Oh just a question. I don’t do any trading. Just hodl. But was curious to know about Bakkt and futures trading.
@_date: 2016-12-26 04:14:54
Yeah, it is $50,000USD a year with ICBC. 
Just learned that WeChat Wallet has a year cap for transactions too at 200,000RMB per year. So once you hit that your WeChat Wallet will be inactive until the following January 1st.
Does anyone know the limits with Alipay?
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:37:45
If you have an investment of $300,000 you could probably mine 5-6 Bitcoin a day. Most people can't afford that investment. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:04:19
1) Send money home with Bitcoin
2) Buy Bitcoin with WeChat Wallet or Alipay
3) Keep all of your savings in Bitcoin (NOT RMB!!)
@_date: 2016-12-27 04:49:10

@_date: 2016-11-10 03:18:12
My Xapo works great. I only keep small amounts in it for spending but their team makes everything easy. Great support, excellent phone app, and easy to use debit card.
@_date: 2019-12-07 22:00:23
I already have the black card. Doesn’t give me an option to get this card unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-12-13 07:52:42
How much did the ATM cost? Do you have to fund the BTC yourself?
@_date: 2019-12-13 12:28:37
Awesome. How much do they pay you to rent your space?
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:47:36
How’d you order it? Got a link?
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:46:46
You designed this yourself?
@_date: 2017-04-14 07:41:32
I know transfers are slow. But I also know Coinbase is consistently unorganized. Same with Kraken. I know they both mean well. But it recently took Kraken 9 days to put a transfer into my account. 
Linked my account. Trying my first transfer. I'm just using it to withdraw Bitcoin. So should be ok!
@_date: 2017-04-14 03:40:21
What are the roles of a teller?
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:45:34
Why do you think it hurts Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:53:56
So I can transfer USD to my account, then buy Bitcoin? I don't live in the US. And needed to setup an account with my phone number from abroad.
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:26:20
What's the limit you can add daily?
@_date: 2017-04-25 09:07:53
Having the same issue. Been a user for years and the support doesn't do too well.
@_date: 2017-04-16 00:33:01
$500 per day?
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:17:12
It's probably not easy for an American not in Germany to open a Fidor account, right?
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:05:34
So a user can use their bank to instantly buy BTC? How long does it take? And what are the fees?
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:06:32
Send me a pm. I'm China based and sell a Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-04-14 03:49:03
So I would need to be a teller as well? My main goal for Abra is to use USD to get Bitcoin. This is a hassle being an American expat with other exchanges. Kraken and Coinbase are both incredibly slow. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 04:25:25
@_date: 2016-09-26 04:10:40
I'm curious too. I think the amount matters. But if 10,000 people all bought 0.1 within the same couple hours, I think it would make a difference.
@_date: 2016-09-10 01:23:54
I have Xapo. Great service and helpful people!!
@_date: 2016-09-26 03:03:25
Just like one day a month?
@_date: 2016-09-06 09:01:23
I'm from America. Just saying. Don't knock an entire country. Sadly, there aren't so many great countries anymore, haha.
@_date: 2016-09-09 00:53:56
How are you making simple purchases in Bitcoin? Say you want bananas? How do you go about paying for them?
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:23:52
As long as they don't scam or hurt you it's completely legal. I wouldn't pay anything more than 3% though. 
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:16:01
Yeah. Not sure what he's thinking.
@_date: 2016-09-26 15:39:50
BTC.COM was formerly Blocktrail. Get that because it's a great private wallet and looks great.
@_date: 2016-09-06 03:50:53
I seriously just looked for so long. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-09-12 20:53:33
Agreed. Buy some donuts, buy some games, and build a website! Spend your Bitcoin and always keep buying.
@_date: 2016-09-21 22:33:15
Why stop at monkeys? Imagine a cow appearing in front of a hungry lion every time someone donates Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-09-02 13:51:21
I love the amount of excitement this cheesecake is bringing. The price has raised $6 since this photo was posted. We need more Bitcoin baked goods!
@_date: 2016-09-03 23:51:18
How many people pay $20 extra often though?
@_date: 2016-09-14 02:20:01
Love that you were also reading the Wiki for Enigma Machine, hahaha
@_date: 2016-09-05 00:17:26
Hell of an answer. Leave your Wallet address too!
@_date: 2016-09-22 04:24:28
Haha, nice. That used to be our favorite late night pizza. I'm only back in town for a big but Geno's Pizza is the new late night pie. So try Geno's next time!
@_date: 2016-09-01 08:00:49
Andy Dick could easily be sidetracked with some drugs or young men though. Not too worried about him putting an end to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-22 04:25:17
There was another beer bill with a much higher tip. Promise. My gf just has better handwriting so I took a photo of that one!

We have a really cool Telegram group for p2p in China. Most of us are in Beijing but quite a few are all over the country. Pm me and I’ll invite you in!
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:12:49
You're absolutely correct. Here's an upvote. In this community we don't need division. We need unity. We should be on the same page since we're on the same team and work together to make this thing thrive.

I used Bitcoin all over Spain this summer. I miss that ham!

Option still isn’t available in my app.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:43:13
Yep. We're already back up from 20% down on Monday. And China can't stop Bitcoin. No government can. And, let's remember, the governments are scared of Bitcoin. We will one day replace banks and FIAT, hopefully. Buying time in 3...2...1...GO!

This is me every NBA season. Sadly, this happens to most people. Start small again and stop while you're ahead. Or don't play so risky!
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:37:02
Why not buy a bit consistently and avoid buying at highs and lows? $20 a day for the next 5 days is much safer than $100 right now.
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:26:01
I'm in the same boat. PM me if you get any updates.
@_date: 2016-09-05 05:55:09
Just sent you some!
@_date: 2016-09-05 21:51:10
Amazingly accurate article that's totally worth reading the whole way! Thanks for that, Noelle.

What if it's more in a few days and that causes you to wait longer? The best time to buy Bitcoin will always be yesterday.
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:22:09
Roger Ver no longer has 250 BTC. He’s unable to partake in this bet.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:20:16
Bam. When Bitcoin equals $1 mil you’ll have $400k. Congrats!
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:23:52
Once this ICO mess is done we'll be back, much happier than before.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:27:00
Just bought.
@_date: 2016-10-25 22:52:59
I've used OpenBazaar before. It's a great idea but still needs a lot of work. What'd you think of it?
@_date: 2016-10-25 22:54:13
Our startup is an SEO company. We can also build Wikipedia pages for our clients. Plus we're affordable. And we accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:31:31
They've told me repeatedly to wait. With their usual 11 day later email replies.
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:41:13
Has happened to me twice. Both times large amounts of money. Support was terrible. They said things like, "Maybe tomorrow!" or "Please be patient. 8 days is normal." I will NEVER use Kraken again.
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:27:15
$4,218 by December 31st.
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:06:31
We offer a 10% Bitcoin discount and companies do go for it. Why not??
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:41:12
In the end, we'll all be happy!
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:40:10
Bitcoin's here to stay. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:09:42
You're going to feel more stupid 10 years from
now. Get back in while you still can.
@_date: 2016-05-25 03:22:07
Nice. Send me a private message.
@_date: 2017-05-06 08:05:20
That's a crazy stat if it's true. Wouldn't that mean most of those wallets are just forgotten about?
@_date: 2016-05-30 19:06:24
I definitely think that could be a possibility :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:54:59
FIAT is the wrong money!!

@_date: 2016-05-24 10:22:54
Yeah, he was featured in that film. Forgot the name. Did you see it?
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:46:09
That was my first attempt at using the card so I know I didn't hit the limit. There's also .7 BTC in my wallet. More than enough for some
Cheap Chilean wine, haha.
@_date: 2016-05-25 12:38:57
I'm in Beijing and part of a BTC meet up here. Quite a few Chinese come. None of my close Chinese friends know much about it. I don't think it's very talked about. Even though there's a ton of Chinese users, most still stick to the system.
@_date: 2016-05-21 01:58:27
It worked at Starbucks today!! Expensive cold brew, haha.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:51:57
Card also denied. Forgot the error message. Was able to buy an hour later once it had recovered.
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:57:36
Ugh. This is frustrating. Why don't more people from the community talk about these companies?!! How often do you use your Xapo card?
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:40:07
People in China are currently paying 15,232RMB ($2,212) right now on BitKan, China's OTC app. The price will not go down.

- 2 IPAs from Beercelona and some olives
- A lighter
@_date: 2016-05-24 02:50:11
Ah, nice. Right now I have Coinbase to transfer to USD. I also have BlockTrail which I really, really like. 
I went with Xapo. Also just scored a free Wirex card. What's Shift all about??
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:57:02
I did. I understand these Bitcoin companies are new, and pretty much one of a kind. But if they can't learn better business tactics like customer service and better organization then they simply won't make it. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:43:26
What if one finds a better wallet to use?
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:48:45
You have to always say it's a 'credit card'?
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:31:03
That'd be helpful!
@_date: 2016-05-30 20:58:25
Not the worst thing in the world. Just don't keep all your funds there.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:56:41
NOTHING. And it won't ever compare either.
@_date: 2016-05-30 20:33:34
Everything. ID and proof of address.
@_date: 2016-05-22 23:55:59
I'll send it to you right now. I'll send you a PM.
@_date: 2016-05-23 19:58:27
Awesome. I just got my limits raised. Will be using it more. Traveling next week so I should be using it quite a bit in Spain.
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:07:52
Ah, ok. Should I have had him run it again?
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:14:08
Welcome to Reddit.
@_date: 2016-05-23 01:00:08
Just sent you the PayPal email.
@_date: 2016-05-15 11:46:48
Hey, I'll send you a private message.
@_date: 2016-05-24 02:17:18
How would they know though? It's just where I store.
@_date: 2016-05-19 11:12:40
The BTC passed pending last week. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 07:53:59
Would it stop at $10,000? I don't think so. I bet you'd feel really bad when Bitcoin hit $100,000. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 14:57:12
I wish I got in earlier as well. Bought some a couple years ago and also heavily invested in LiteCoin and Vertcoin. If you don't remember, Vertcoin shot up to $15.00 immediately. Today is sits at $0.035 :(
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:55:03
Changelly was at $2300 per Bitcoin earlier.
@_date: 2016-05-24 00:50:05
Ok, cool. Still waiting to hear from him. I just sent it to his Gmail.
@_date: 2017-07-08 03:08:31
This is FUD. Nothing is official yet. I wonder where we'd be if both sides quit trolling?
@_date: 2016-05-24 00:49:45
Ah, thanks. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 11:52:12
I just emailed them and Tweeted them. Waiting. Do you use Xapo too?
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:58:17
Well, I did this earlier this week. I moved $5.00 into my Breadwallet. Got out the remaining bits, and moved them to my other wallet. Easy. No lost bits. The fee was only $0.50 but this is a simple method to not lose Bitcoin. $3 today could be $176 in a few years when a BTC is $100,000. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 10:42:38
Yeah, I live in China. Would love to see sources!!
@_date: 2016-05-16 11:13:11
I would just help him. We're part of a big Bitcoin group here in Beijing. I'd gladly take BTC to send someone RMB. Do you also need help?
@_date: 2016-05-30 16:59:33
Thanks so much, Jessie!!
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:44:07
Just what he told me, lol. I've spoken to a few different people about my limits. No idea what's the problem. I've bought consistently with them and can't get a firm answer. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:56:45
Abra just lowered their limit for everyone too. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 10:34:55
We're traveling to Spain next week. I'm armed with my new Xapo card and my gf just got a Wirex card. I'll give you a full review of them when we finish our trip. 
@_date: 2016-05-22 00:40:52
I fully agree. I hate Starbucks and mostly all huge corporations. Sadly though, not many places in Beijing accept Visa and I needed to try my new card. There are way better local coffee shops here with much cheaper cold brew.
@_date: 2016-05-19 14:55:35
Make a wallet ASAP. Then send me your private message. I'll gladly send you $20. Welcome to the BTC club!!
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:57:22
I suggest buying around $2k as well. But, I don't think we go any lower than that. This resolution is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 11:12:14
I'm waiting to be verified right now. And yeah, the BTC passed pending a week ago. The bottle of wine was only $10 and there is way more of than in my wallet. Do you guys use Xapo?
@_date: 2016-05-31 02:11:11
I have no idea how to check that...
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:23:16
Haha. I'm based in Beijing. I wonder if I should just buy a bunch and sell them?
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:14:09
Very Likely
Sort of Likely 
Not Likely
Very Unlikely (Check)
@_date: 2016-05-19 11:18:05
My card is waiting to be verified. I should still be able to buy a $10 bottle of wine. It's activated too.
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:02:04
I can do 1.5. How many you want? Anyone else game?
@_date: 2016-05-21 00:06:15
Yeah, I suppose that can be confusing, haha. Are you a Capo user too?
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:58:07
Mine should be verified soon. How long did your take to get verified?
@_date: 2016-05-26 22:17:40
Really sorry this happened to you. There's been too many negative things about Coinbase recently that I had to stop using them. I was just annoyed that they haven't been replying to emails. But it seems like a lot of you have it much worse. Hope t gets resolved for you.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:22:00
Thanks, Squashman.
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:02:17
Happy My with my recent purchase. Don't even worry about it. 
@_date: 2016-05-22 10:34:20
Yeah, I hope so too. Am hoping some restaurants or cool taprooms will accept BTC. Are you going to Primavera?
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:02:58
Sure. I'm not greedy. How much would you all in the US pay for them? BTW, have you tried OpenBazaar yet? All the prices are still messed up.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:43:49
Think they'll never take off?
@_date: 2016-05-30 16:55:29
I think I'm gonna get seperate cards in each currency. I got the Xapo USD card since I'm American. Clearly should've got the Eu card first since I knew I was traveling to Spain. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:23:58
Yeah, they look great. Really great. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 14:36:26
Did you get your card verified to raise the limits? Fees are normal with Xapo. International fees, sure. But I'd rather use Bitcoin than a regular bank no matter what.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:58:39
I'd prefer to have what I pay for instantly. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:03:47
Do NOT USE KRAKEN. They're horrible. Use LocalBitcoins. Sure. You pay a higher fee. Butyou get your BTC quick and you can choose sellers based on reviews. People use Kraken and Coinbase because they think that's all there is. My guess is in 2-3 years Coinbase and Kraken will be long gone.
@_date: 2016-05-24 21:18:04
Where are you located?
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:59:27
How high of a rate did you pay? Think I need to try them out. Is CoinMama cheaper than Changelly?
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:20:31
Poorly marketed. It's mainly spam and trolling. As someone with years of online marketing experience, I would say it's a poor campaign.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:32:28
Agreed BIP91 is coming. And once that was known, the price shot up. Nobody gives a duck about BCC. I'll be using my BCC to buy more BTC.
@_date: 2016-05-26 11:27:28
Thanks. Just talked to their chat support and it was excellent! 
@_date: 2016-05-29 17:53:59
How can I check keys?
@_date: 2016-05-22 00:42:20
They've been better than Wirex. Hillary from support is pretty good.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:15:00
Agreed. And 2000 is a great floor. I'd prefer a stable 2000 over a rocky 3000 anyday.
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:02:54
Sure. Well Xapo and Wirex are both popular. No telling which is better. Xapo, maybe, since Visa is accepted at more places. There's a new US card that links to your Coinbase account as well, but lots of folks have been having issues with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:48:05
Agreed. Things will be much, MUCH better in 2 weeks. And we got shitty BCC coins to sell for more BTC. What's not to be happy about??
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:16:32
Ver is broke. And doesn't dress well. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 15:27:04
Haha. Where's MSC at today?
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:28:34
Yeah, I didn't delete the wallet. But no point in just having spare bits in a wallet I'm not going to use anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-08 04:11:11
I haven't chosen a side as I hope a resolution happens. But can you tell me why you're for BIP148? 
@_date: 2016-05-29 04:23:26
I saw $532 at one point. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:03:52
Does BCC make it until 2018? Everyone I know is selling them as soon as they get them, haha.
@_date: 2016-05-27 09:15:57
You lie everytime you play poker. I just know it. :D
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:14:03
So far so good?
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:51:15
Nope. After I did that they said to wait 60 days. I've been a Coinbase customer for 4 years. In January they randomly reset my limits. Also recently spoke to a guy that used to work at Coinbase. Said it was a complete shitshow. And they don't pay employees in Bitcoin, haha. What the hell are you guys doing?!!
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:40:54
Oh think Coinbase will shutdown?
@_date: 2016-05-22 00:38:45
It was 2, haha. But yeah, Starbucks is way overpriced in Beijing.
@_date: 2016-05-22 10:07:03
I'd love to know as well. We'll be flying to Barcelona next week too. So currently you haven't found many places that accept BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:17:45
What is bit 4? And what is btc1?
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:17:36
Yep. FUCK YOU. And your FUD. And go have shitty weekend to, ya troll.
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:24:49
Buy everyday and don't list to FUD. You won't be sorry.
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:28:46
So it's not a hardfork and everyone wins? Bitcoin's improved and the drama ends?
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:57:42
And then devalue it 3-4 times a year making everybody use Bitcoin, haha.
@_date: 2016-05-28 03:09:52
I really dig Blocktrail. Try it out. Great iOS app.
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:33:50
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:23:36
Screw science. And get a job!
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:50:12
Buy a bit everyday and it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:36:56
@_date: 2016-07-07 08:32:59
I don't think a huge percentage of miners will be backing out. By now, with all of the money and time they've invested into all of this, I think most of them are huge believers like us. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:27:28
Kidding. Very stoked about a resolution, haha.
@_date: 2016-07-04 23:29:33
Would that just connect to one wallet or multiple wallets?
@_date: 2016-07-27 08:46:43
How would the transfer be cancelled? That's never happened to me before.
@_date: 2016-07-31 05:48:43
That's what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:19:29
Yes, definitely. What's your take on BCC and the ABC? I can't believe the other side thought, "Well, we didn't get our way, but let's try this out and see what happens."
@_date: 2016-05-24 02:21:18
Good answer!! What mobile wallets are you using at the moment?
@_date: 2016-07-18 11:49:32
Never too late, sure. I still actively buy. I did buy in 2013. But most of that was used to buy LiteCoin and Vertcoin. Not a very good decision. Actually. I don't want to talk about it, haha.
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:21:53
He'll have made another troll account by October.
@_date: 2016-07-07 08:48:53
We're all good if people keep buying.
@_date: 2016-07-04 13:41:18
There's way better islands than Phuket I hear. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 00:11:34
Can you explain the Bitpay process of making a purchase using the card? I'm currently using Xapo.
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:41:44
I think those days are soon. In the next 12 months it'll be hard for most people to be able to buy one BTC since they won't be able to afford one BTC.
@_date: 2016-07-31 02:26:57
It'd been so steady around $650-$660. More steady than normal. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:18:39
Possibly. I've heard from multiple people that know Ver that say he isn't as wealthy as the world believes. Years of bad investments. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 05:05:55
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:31:43
Not gonna buy a $10 domain name so people can actually find your posts on Google?
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:32:58
So which chain would be called Bitcoin then? 
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:36:44
I'll take this bet. Send me a private messageS
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:59:02
@_date: 2016-07-11 02:32:03
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:26:47
So there will only be 2 chains? Or 3? And what will they be called?
@_date: 2016-07-17 05:07:59
Xapo's much better. With Wirex, to fund the card, you need to sell Bitcoin and they add USD to your account. So say you want to add 1 Bitcoin to your Wirex card. They'd add $665 to your card. With Xapo, your Bitcoin stays in your account. If I buy A $3.00 coffee somewhere, it takes $3.00 of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:56:45
How long until you make a return?
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:37:24
But all companies are taking different sides too. I feel like it just threatens everything we believe is Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2016-07-22 00:10:14
Wirex is E-Coin? Regardless, Xapo owns Wirex.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:58:33
Thanks for the detailed answer. So what do you think actually happens?
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:52:26
Far less. That's why BCC is his new big idea to get rich again. Since he first 2 times it didn't really work out.
@_date: 2016-07-18 21:00:47
Was the fork proposed? I own some ETH but nees is hard to follow.
@_date: 2016-07-07 03:50:00
Might not be right for us. We're a digital marketing agency.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:31:20
FUD. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:15:18
I've gotten a response from them in less than a day before. But I've got the bulk of responses in about 10-15 days. So that's why I don't use Coinbase anymore. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:34:28
They WILL be exciting.
@_date: 2016-07-19 07:27:07
We actually, really could, with good marketing aim to do something like that.
@_date: 2016-07-26 11:58:22
Yeah. CoinsCrypt too. I want a real review!!
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:12:30
Jessie, I sent an email yesterday. I'm unable to link my Xapo to my Uber and now I'm in debt to Uber. It's only a few dollars but I don't like being in debt. Please help!
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:23:07
That USD you paid with us bouncing everywhere too, as well as other world markets. But they're not gonna show you that.
@_date: 2016-07-13 22:55:58
The 24hr volume has gone up too, right?
@_date: 2016-07-07 20:43:25
I hope to be at this point soon!
@_date: 2016-07-01 06:40:14
More people always waiting for the price to drop before buying. You should buy everyday. Always.
@_date: 2016-07-22 10:27:33
Thanks a lot, man. Just put up this service: 
Spread the word!
@_date: 2016-07-23 07:29:17
Agreed. This community should be full of positivity. We're all in this together.
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:37:11
So Zap desktop provides the node? Or you still need to have your own node?
@_date: 2016-07-08 09:31:52
What countries do those two work in?
@_date: 2016-05-24 02:50:54
And why do you use Circle to buy over Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:28:34
This dude's awesome!! Found him a cheaper flight and like promised, he paid up. Thanks, man. Safe travels!!
@_date: 2016-07-22 00:10:53
Absolutely. Much better than selling more than enough just to have fiat ready to spend.
@_date: 2016-07-07 11:55:26
Why worry about the miners in China? They have very cheap costs.
@_date: 2016-07-22 07:27:04
Sure. I'd rather just use Xapo and not have to worry though.
@_date: 2016-07-29 11:25:07
You can PayPal me and I'll send it to you ASAP :D Send me a private message.
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:05:46
They really accept Bitcoin now? That's who I usually use!!
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:40:16
What are your skills?
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:18:45
How much do you buy every week and how long have you been doing this?
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:00:27
I'm not in Argentina. I'm able to use my Xapo for a ton of different things. So far the only places I can't use it is with Uber and iTunes.
@_date: 2016-05-29 05:07:13
You think BTC can be up to $15,000 each in the next 8-10 months?

The 24hr volume has gone up too, right?
@_date: 2016-07-31 04:03:11
What'd Clif High say today?
@_date: 2016-07-12 22:45:42
One of my friend's always uses his Xapo with Uber.
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:42:35
It is a Visa card. Not sure why it's not able to be used. Very frustrating. Now I can't take use Uber because the card bounced and I'm in debt to Uber, haha. Sure, it's only $4.00, but still. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 11:08:50
I meant currencies. I mainly use RMB, not USD.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:47:02
It goes up and down everyday. Don't worry!!
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:02:33
Satoshi has 500,000. I'm sure he's been buying though, haha.
@_date: 2016-07-22 06:15:47
That's what I don't want though. I'd rather keep Bitcoin and convert it at a purchase. I don't want to sell one Bitcoin to have $670 on a card, the Bitcoin go up to $690 the next day. Makes no sense.
@_date: 2016-07-07 20:43:26
I hope to be at this point soon!
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:23:21
Even if they're moved as a transaction?
@_date: 2016-07-23 16:24:11
Almost tried Bit2Me. Great company concept. Just didn't need it while I was there. How often do you use it? There needs to be a company like that in every country!!
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:56:28
Yeah, I checked out a few of them like CoinsCrypt. Seemed ok until I saw that they had fake social media numbers on the site. When going to their actual Facebook, they had less than a hundred fans. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 05:49:01
Let's both buy $20 right now!
@_date: 2016-07-08 03:17:42
$41 profit was that important to you?
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:03:50
Screenshots are perfect. Also graphs of gains/losses. Areas/articles to research/study from are also helpful. I don't think your book is going to cover everything on trading for a new trader, right? I bet this book would have a huge success if you can make Poloniex and Bitmex easy to understand for beginning traders.
@_date: 2016-07-15 07:24:46
Great film!!
@_date: 2016-07-16 10:43:44
Yep. Never be afraid. Because one day you're still not going to have enough!!
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:38:27
"Content is king" is a dreaded phrase that SEOs hate, haha.
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:48:52
So $80 a week?
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:42:27
@_date: 2016-07-03 06:48:57
True, haha.
@_date: 2016-07-27 23:30:29
Buy X amount of Bitcoin every week. Spend about 20% of that Bitcoin every week. Repeat every week!!
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:54:53
Nah, Satoshi was the guy that bought that 10,000BTC pizza years ago.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:22:25
No UASF? NO HF?
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:31:20
These are all great suggestions, everyone. But I was hoping to just get a simple site up for something needed. Not something so detailed.
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:36:19
Who'd you sell to at 10% over?
@_date: 2016-07-23 16:09:19
I think some sort of marketplace similar to Fiverr would also be huge for freelancers. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:28:58
It’s good but doesn’t have many countries. I’m looking into comparing South American and Asian rates to the US exchange price. 
For an article so please help!
@_date: 2016-07-18 11:20:27
How many US Bitcoin users are seriously paying taxes on their BTC?
@_date: 2016-07-23 16:22:51
I used Local Bitcoins when I was there. The 2 Bitcoin ATMs I tried using were both shut down in Barcelona.
@_date: 2016-07-10 07:04:03
Bitcoin option doesn't show on the iPhone app.
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:37:11
Fully agree. Working on this now!!
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:21:29
FUCK IT.
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:12:16
Balance stays in BTC like it should. Companies like Wirex that make you sell BTC for FIAT are bullshit.
@_date: 2016-07-31 05:47:11
Can we just start a tiny homes community and see where it goes?
@_date: 2016-07-08 00:13:21
Monthly costs or a one time fee?
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:53:10
Coinbase is running Instagram ads right now. All of the comments are from pissed off customers. This is what happens when people who have no idea what to do, start a business.
@_date: 2016-07-14 01:03:19
Yeah. I couldn't hang. Circle is better but they're slow too, haha. Two things I hope to see in the Bitcoin community soon: 1) Better looking websites that don't look pre-2005 and 2) Faster, more reliable customer service
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:05:28
I agree. I try to spend where I can. Why not? Bitcoin is an investment but it's also a currency. So you should spend it.!
@_date: 2016-07-31 04:07:22
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:08:55
I'm a happy Bitcoin user, lol. Are you not?
@_date: 2016-05-26 10:47:37
So what exchange would you recommend? What do you use?
@_date: 2016-07-02 00:14:00
Not really sure. There already are so many sites like price checkers, news, views, etc. Just wanted ideas on something. Could be cool.
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:48:17
"May the force be....What????? Where the fuck are my Bitcoin???"
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:29:57
Doesn't always look like a nice guy. Definitely looks like a virgin. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:56:46
I own some ETH too. I guess I'm not fully sold on it yet.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:08:00
Exactly. We want to gain users. We shouldn't risk losing anyone.
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:37:31
He's reading all that, right? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:03:58
These apps aren't available yet?
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:56:50
Andreas is buying ETH?
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:32:44
Why is the next target 800 after 1400? Care to explain?
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:27:01
Damn, that sounds like a good plan. What was the highest BTC has been at during the time frame?
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:27:12
Not a good human. But I guess we all know that since he's been on the run for several years.
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:19:04
Ok. After some research,  does accept Bitcoin. Thy also accept Dogecoin, haha.
@_date: 2016-07-22 05:10:44
Yep. I signed up for Wirex ages ago on E-Coin. Wow.
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:12:32
Bitcoin. Because all of the other cryptocurrencies aren't cryptocurrencies, they're nerds saying they've built something that will be needed in the future, but not now. Definitely not now.
@_date: 2016-07-17 13:38:21
I'll gladly loan you 1 Bitcoin if you can give me 1.5 in 7 days!
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:21:45
Yep. Nothing to worry about over here. Move along.
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:35:09
You should use your time wisely. Work harder. Buy more.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:08:59
Is it correcting or did yesterday's announcement spread a lot of FUD?
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:54:20
On both sides of the scaling debate. Nobody wants to lose money. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:29:26
Sadly, Coinbase is the only exchange that's legal to use in my state. Gemini and Cex won't work. And Kraken is slower than Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:00:49
All these articles about Coinbase growing... This business doesn't work if their customers are not happy. When better businesses eventually come to compete, Coinbase will fade away.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:23:52
Trusting your personal wealth with Coinbase may be the riskiest thing you can do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:52:46
The time you waste making 0.000000000000000037 on a faucet could be better earning money to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:36:29
Never time to sell. You gonna be one of "those" guys?
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:11:11
Would take a lot for it to go down that much. I say we're back to $700 by next week.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:07:59
Is LibertyX only available in the US?
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:18:25
Not the place for you if you think it goes down to $1500. Also not a place for you if you're just waiting for it to drop again. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 10:42:29
Damn, I had no idea about all of those. I'll check them out. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:35:21
This guy has been pretty accurate in the past. Sure, he's a bit odd, but I guess we're all weirdos in a way, lol.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:28:55
My Xapo links to my Apple ID but not Apple Pay.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:53:44
I thought Andreas was all Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:47:35
Proof of gains, mistakes you learned from, plenty of graphs, screenshots, and profits.
@_date: 2016-07-19 05:42:38
I have a marketing background. And pretty much everyone I talk to about Bitcoin is sold on it. I've had over 100 people buy recently. Feels good, but still not enough.
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:41:00
Gemini and Cex don't work in quite a few states in the US. Coinbase is the only option for some to get decent rates. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:48:31
Floor is now. Floor is good. Don't spread FUD. BUY NOW.
@_date: 2016-07-19 07:21:50
We all need to be vocal about this!! 
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:09:14
Are there any other ways for us to win without the rest of the world losing?
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:37:02
Xapo keeps a Bitcoin balance. Works well as I've used it in multiple countries with no problem. Has a cool app too!
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:43:10
That wouldn't happen. Too much money in play from both sides of this debate. And if Bitcoin's doing so bad, how'd we get to $3,000?
