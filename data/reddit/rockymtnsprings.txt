I (the FED) have set your house on fire (inflate the money supply).  You are free to stay in the house or leave.  


I will not jail you for staying in the house, but if you want to be dumb.  Hey guy, live with your decisions.

Good lord, I used to wonder why the serfs never fought to over throw their lords.  Makes sense now.

Are you questioning the crown's divine right?

That is the issue.  You are not free to do what you want with your money.  You are forced to go and invest it.  I wonder who likes this arrangement?

I know government and politicians have our interests at heart.  They just care more and are not in it for the profit.  They are not greedy capitalists.

Lol, spin up the printing presses boys.  We're going to the moon in our own Lambos.  Nobody can stop us now.  No looking back.

Lol, epileptic seizures ensue.

Lol, not wanting to laugh.   Man that has to hurt, but come on people.  Have we not learned about things in life?  Oh well, lessons have got to be taught.

Yeah, lets only make the rich and elites be able to get rich and be elites.  Now get out there and protest for 15.
