It's too late, Bitcoin would have been better off as an asset at this point. Now the whole market is suffering

Because there are much better alternatives available. If I hand you an old Nokia or a brand new smartphone, which one would you use?

If someone had millions, even billions invested in Bitcoin, and if they sell their BTC, would it affect the BTC price? And if they short BTC with futures could they not manipulate the market?

They don't work.

Coinsquare botched a transfer for me a few months back, refused to answer my emails even after showing proof of transaction. I threatened to call the cops and anti fraud on them and I got an apology letter from the CEO and my BTC magically appeared in my wallet. Prices always seem way off as well when compared to other exchanges.
Edit: Word.

True. Would have made more sense if the pizza guy lived in a mansion and the BTC guy was delivering the pizza...

So true, I keep telling my daughter this.

You know me well... He was already invested and doubled down on his own.

You know your mind is in the right place when your kid gives you a Father's day card and it reminds you of Bitcoin ��.

We'll, he's clearly a whale.

I started DCA in 2014 during a strong downtrend and continue to do so. No ragerts.

Face tats, don't forget the face tats.

It's ok, I've been buying dips since 2014. You'll be fine.

Maybe don't call the guy you hope returns your funds scum.

All of those steps are from pacing back and forth staring at the price.

Same. Had some fiat ready, waiting for a drop and then Coinbase shit on that idea.

Nothing new, when China bans and fuds it's game over until it finds a low and they can profit heavily from. Korean officials were buying Bitcoin while spreading fud, don't think for a second Chinese officials don't do the same, but on a larger scale with less fucks.
