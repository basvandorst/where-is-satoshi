What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:20:21
Oh no I can't buy now that it's going down! I'll lose money! And I'm no dummy
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:06:15
I'm actually in the negatives due to huge fees on paxful
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:45:39
Yeah that's true you can't really insure crypto much, yet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:29:23
Yeah I heard that too, maybe we will get 11k by the end of the week!
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:32:49
It's about percentages not the actual difference 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:49:12
Fees, crazy high
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:56:54
Sell it all
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:42:48
Oh, no I don't think there's a hack either I was just answering the question about CB's insurance 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:00:42
Not necessarily, I know from experience that many people have buys and sells set up at 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:28:30
Yeah I was just looking at that same screen, if we're "lucky" enough we'll all be rich soon.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:09:09
I feel you man, it's probably going to come soon, Bitcoin can't keep growing this fast, so close to 11k now, I want to think a dip will come but I can't just keep watching it rise.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:53:05
That's false, bitcoin has never failed to recover from a setback, sure it may plummet 80-90%, but those who are smart will buy thousands of coins then, and when bitcoin goes back up, they'll sell then and make millions

His vision included employers paying in BTC as well.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:39:32
That's never happened though. All evidence suggests a possible fall in price, and then a skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:59:17
It's happened
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:33:24
That's one specific prediction 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:56:27
This dude��
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:12:41
That's true, and congratulations man, it even seems like Bitcoin could touch 11k soon enough
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:49:32
There's little evidence suggesting crypto is going down any time soon, I'd rather throw all my money in now at 9.4k than wait till it's at 15k and make far less
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:37:28
Fiat and crypto
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:21:10
Wow, 9, 10, and 11k all in a few days 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:07
Cryptos usually get really large in price, then "pop" like bubbles and drop drastically in price, but what people neglect to realize is that cryptos are bubbles made of a certain "gum" that every time it's bubble pops, the "gum" gets stronger, allowing the bubble to get bigger, meaning it will eventually recover.
