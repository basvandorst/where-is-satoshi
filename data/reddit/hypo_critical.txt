I'm not sure how the ledger Nano works, but bitcoin doesn't need you to specify the amount you recieve. You only need to specify the amount you want to send.

Other people who think it holds value

I'm running a full node

Do I have to login to send them some bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:54:02
How long did they take to send you the license key?

and there you can use something like 10minutemail to avoid spam

Which is a good thing...
I think the popularity gain of has increased the quality of . I see more discussions about the negative sides of Bitcoin without people shutting it down with downvotes, than half a year ago.
To increase the value and quality of Bitcoin we need to face critisism. Which wouldn't be possible if this subreddit was one single circlejerk and **was** really close to that. It still is from time to time but it's getting better. 
So, thanks for increasing the value of @_date: 2014-06-09 09:11:47
How do I contribute?

This article wasn't about Bitcoin, it only warns you that you might fry your pc if you install a torrented version of Watchdogs.
So why is this "mainstream media standart" and why is that bad ?
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:47:14
Would have missed it.

What a nice way to add to the discussion.

We are now at block Nr. 417371. 
419328 - 417371 = 1957 Blocks to go. 
Which means it would take 19570 minutes or roughly 13.6 days.

How can you browse that subreddit? It's sometimes worse then /pol/.
Also, nobody is censoring "reddit". As a mod you can censor a subreddit, but not the whole thing.

Not really, a big chunk of the rest of the comments still go the same way. I don't mind the loud liberatian/an-cap  voice this subreddit has. But sometimes it boils down to an Echo-Chamber, which excludes every other opinion.
Also it's an interesting phenomenon: if you point out that are recieving alot of downvotes. The votes will swing in your favour. Probably because there's a dispararity of opinions between the lurkers of /new/ and the frontpage

*sometimes* is the keyword here. I agree it was much worse before.
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:21:04


It goes against the narrative in this subreddit.
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:21:31
This is well rounded opinion and I appreciate that. (IMO you're right on that one)
If you had started this thread with exactly this comment, we could have seen an interesting discussion, instead of name-calling and flaming.

The viewcount of a random youtube-video is a fact, I'll give you that. But that doesn't mean that your implication has any justification.
The meaning of facts are what we make them out to be. Facts don't speak for themselves.
