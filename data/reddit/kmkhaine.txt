If not for vigorous enforcement, it would be very lucrative to create shares in imaginary work, sell those shares, and disappear into the hills. When legitimate investors get fleeced in that manner, it is little consolation that they could have/should have done more research or been more vigilant or diversified their investments.

I though we were discussing investigators placing the orders themselves to track down SR shippers. On a more meta level, it's possible to put together trafficker algorithms the same way that they put together money laundering algorithms. Again, it all comes down to whether the volume justifies the operation.

It's unsolicited, repeated, and off-topic. What else is needed?

I say could because I don't think people are creating changetip accounts for the pennies offered.

If 50 people from adviceanimals made daily posts here offering you $.02 and suggesting that you check out some funny advice animal comics, you would rightly consider it a systematic campaign to push an agenda not consistent with the purpose of this subreddit. I didn't say he's a spammer. Nobody here is individually. However, the push to popularize bitcoin with trivial tips is at its core a spam campaign.

I find gold completely pointless myself. However, it is an understood unit of exchange that has value within the community as a token of appreciation. The theoretical ability to be changed tipped $100,00 doesn't really change the on the ground reality of 'follow this link to find out how you could win $.07.'

They don't need to fund a search of an area. It only takes a few drops to determine whether there's a pattern in the shipping location and drop off time. From there, it's a matter of surveillance. It's all a question of whether they believe a particular dealer is owrth the effort.

There's an implicit solicitation of on-topic content and responses in a sub-reddit. When I say it's repeated, I am not accusing any one person here of being a dedicated bot spammer. However, certain cliques have made it their mission to be bitcoin ambassadors in part by using changetip. Collectively they can be seen as spamming when 100% of posts that hit the front page have a changetip.

It's far more likely that he is cooperating and they're establishing an alternative narrative in hopes of using him to secure indictments against others in the community.

No real way around it. He started SR 2.0 to make some money and test some tech, not become a martyr. I don't know what they're charging him with yet, but I guarantee there will be enough stuff on there to put him away for five lifetimes if he doesn't cooperate.

Decent tips already exist. They're called Reddit gold. changetips are pointless at best and intrusive at worst.

You're on the other side of this but understand that to an outsider, 'tipping' is spamming people to visit another subreddit. It's a blatant enough transgression that they don't see it as something that would require a rule or warning.

And Al Capone, an average Joe who miscalculated his taxes, somehow had it come up during his tax evasion trial that he was a mob boss and responsible for the murders of dozens.

But this isn't about a basic user. It's about the defendant's lawyer who presumably will know a LOT about bitcoin for the sole purpose of cross-examining people like OP who try to softball things in for the jury. Explaining to a basic user that bitcoin is like cash is fine up and until someone gets up and asks questions like 'does it have the full faith and credit of the US government' and 'how do you earn bitcoins'. The problem here is that each contradiction that the OP gets caught in on cross makes him look less and less credible until it reaches a point where he's no longer able to effectively advocate. At the point where they make him use the sentence 'cash that isn't legal tender' he's not going to be much help to anybody.

He's going to say this to a jury in court. Opposing counsel is going to cross-examine him. If he oversimplifies things, they're going to make him look like a liar on cross. Bitcoin is different from cash in ways that would be important in many criminal prosecutions.

The first 20 girls I slept with couldn't hear enough about how I was min/maxing raid damage in Naxxramas by using a Scorch rotation on my fire Mage.

You got an elevated level of questioning for triggering a special warning. If you have a bank account with $1, they ask your name. If it's $1,000,000, they freeze your account and ask more questions.

It sounds like it might be called a search warrant.
