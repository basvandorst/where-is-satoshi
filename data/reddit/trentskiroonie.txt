In terms of mining, I know a block is just a bundle of transactions, but what does it mean to "find" a block? And why do transactions need to be organized into blocks? Why can't the blockchain just exist as a series of individual transactions without the block structure?

Truth be told, I never thought a currency could be a valid topic for a science fair, but its cool that bitcoin is!

I get what you're saying, but this post isn't constructive at all. It's just presumptuous and condescending.

The vast majority of the news on is good, so you could make that coorelation any time the price is going up. The fact that the price has gone down for the past year despite all the good news on reddit shows that good news should not necessarily indicate a price increase.

Thanks, I think I finally understand mining now!

Good for you. Honestly, I haven't found a better solution for cold storage than this right here. The only improvement I might add is having an offline raspberry pi (or something similar) to sign transactions side by side with your online computer so you don't have to restart and unplug internet between steps. It really is easy and only adds minimal inconvenience when you consider the added security.

Ownership of any bitcoins is tantamount to being the only person who knows or has access to the private key associated with the address to which those coins are allocated. If you don't know your private key or someone else also knows it, then those aren't *really* your coins.

So worst case scenario, bitcoin transactions end up no worse than credit card transactions... IF it ever gets that bad.
Also keep in mind, bitcoin transactions from payer to payee are still possible without a payment processor, which is one of Bitcoin's biggest advantages over credit cards.

Yet another question of security vs liberty

Well if my cash gets stolen I'm not getting that back either, but I don't see you criticizing cash. Cash and credit cards have their place, and so does Bitcoin. They're just better at different things.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:36:41
Thank you kind sir!

It's a wallet on a device that stays connected to the internet. Hot just means it's ready to use and send payments. In contrast, a cold wallet is usually kept offline so that it is more secure but harder to spend from. Hot wallets are like the wallet you keep in your pocket, usually containing small amounts, and cold wallets are more like a safe in your house, containing larger amounts.

Travel isn't the only reason a payment could be rejected.


It's still a pain in the ass when someone fraudulently uses your card. Sometimes the bank won't catch it, so you have to dispute the charges yourself. Then you have to sign and return an affidavit. Then they have to cancel your old card. Then they have to send you a new one. Then you have to update your card on any recurring payments or services that store that information.
Bitcoin has all the advantages/disadvantages of cash, except it can be used online. That kind of function can be useful. That's all I'm trying to say.

Well, I did write it, so yeah... I would call it scripted
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:47:34
I've had this happen with BOTH of my credit cards from different banks, and the process was the same. Even if you were right about the affidavit, at the very least they have to send you a new card, which is the biggest hassle of the whole process.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:45:46
Well, I just had a situation that ended up being more difficult with a credit card, but it could go either way. Bitcoin has its disadvantages too.
My realization was not that Bitcoin should replace credit cards. It was more that bitcoin is like the cash of the internet. In person, I can pay with cash or card depending on which is more convenient. Online, the choice should be bitcoin or card. Credit cards have not replaced cash, and bitcoin should not replace credit cards.
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:22:04
I thought we were talking about theft, but if you want to talk destruction, partially destroyed keys can be recovered as well. It just takes longer if more of the key is destroyed.
Still, I've never heard of anyone having their damaged cash replaced. In fact, I'd bet that the odds of having your cash damaged in such a way that it couldn't be spent but could be recognized and replaced is pretty fucking slim. You're talking about extreme hypotheticals here.

Alright, so you ban one group today. Then what? Are you going to ban more bad actors when they pop up later? Who's maintaining this list of banned/approved miners? Who do I have to pay to make sure I can mine?
The consensus rules have to apply to everyone, and you must build them in a way that encourages good behavior. None of this one-off exception to the rules bullshit.
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:08:18
Same reasons I did. No chance of rejected payment, no sharing of information that could authorize future transactions (e.g. credit card details), no middle man, these are things that may not ALWAYS matter, but sometimes they do, and bitcoin is better for those times.

Price fell because we've had huge unsustainable growth for so long and we were due for some recoil. The BU "threat" hasn't changed at all and had little bearing on this week's price change.

I could threaten the neighborhood kids who keep ringing my doorbell after hours that I'll turn them into newts, but they'll just keep doing it because my plan for turning them into newts isn't convincing.
Your plan isn't convincing either (for reasons I've mentioned but you've yet to address).
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:41:20
The threat must include a solid plan for follow-through, or it won't be threatening. Your plan is completely empty and won't scare anybody.

If that's true, then I probably won't continue to use Bitcoin.

I agree with the sentiment, but coinbase multisig is still a good option for people who want control over their coins, and it provides a safety net for people who don't fully trust themselves with their own keys. Yes, they can sill monitor your spending, but that doesn't matter to everybody.
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:42:23
You may lose your coinbase account, but you'll never lose your bitcoins with multisig. You can use your 2 of 3 to move your coins to any other wallet at any time without even touching coinbase's servers. They couldn't stop you if they wanted to.

Could you clarify what you mean when you say "trusted nodes"?
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:45:18
Because 0.01 BTC might be worth more than most people are willing to spend on a lottery ticket some day. Or it might be worth too little for people to care.
BTC is not the standard against which costs are measured, and it will be a long time before it is, if ever.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:25:48
I agree, but you could keep it at $1 worth of BTC without saying that you are. Just adjust the price every week to the new amount of BTC.

Same here. See you on the exchange!

I don't have a source on this, but I believe they are required to do this as a part of some international law. IIRC they don't keep digital copies of this information, but they keep paper copies on file for 7 years as required.
Edit: It's FINRA regulation that requires this, not international law.

I'm not sure if it would be slower for someone from UK, but I'm from US, and even if it took a day or two longer it would still be faster than any other way I know of, besides maybe localbitcoins.com

Didn't Germany just declare bitcoin to be legal tender for tax and trade? If you want to talk about inherent value, then government adoption is a huge step in the right direction. If more governments follow suit, so will their citizens, and it will be hard to say that bitcoin has any less inherent value than paper money.

I was in the same boat as you this week. Signed up to a bunch of exchanges on Monday, MtGox still hasn't verified me, Coinbase took 3 days plus another 4 days to complete my first purchase, Localbitcoins was no use because I live in a fairly rural area. I didn't even bother with other large exchanges because they openly said it would take several days before I could even transfer funds from my bank.
So I took a shot on a newer/smaller exchange,  They had me verified in an hour, I wired funds from my bank, and I was purchasing bitcoins 24 hours later. I think a lot of places have been struggling to meet this sudden uprise in demand lately. Everyone goes to the big boys, but they're just swamped, so the lesser used exchanges have more time to devote per user. It's a bit of a risk, but it worked out well for me.
