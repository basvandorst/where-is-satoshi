Ive got some giftcards in the past and then I just tell the teller that I bought the Giftcard with Bitcoin.  
It helps bridge their mind over to the use cases for Bitcoin.

The majority of people dont have more than 3 to 5 hundred dollars spare income.

Cus ya gotta pay for every little thing so that certain uber rich can be uber richer. Things like this and the stagnant wages and increasing rental costs are why people don't have more than 300 to 500 in spare income at any given time.

Edit: Exchange traded funds exist for ZEC, ETC &amp; more... Its not difficult for large spenders to get in, they're getting in just not announcing it. Not having a regulated ETF doesn't mean the market is inherently bad its actually positive in regard to true decentralization.
Today the S&amp;P hit new highs which is bullish, considering Bitcoin did some weird shit today it could be related. Use one market to pump another, use the early ETF fud and maintenance to manipulate then make money in Forex. Keep the carnival game going while America's gov collapses, you know... avg wednesday stuff.

I would buy $5 worth of Litecoin because its cheap to move and convert and you'll get about 1/10th of 1 LTC.  
It could lead to a larger holding of Bitcoin if LTC moves up in BTC value. Best of luck.

Its all perspective. As an agnostic non-christian, who's pro-science, this calendar speaks to me.

The original roman calendar was fixed many times, most recently in the 1500s with the addition of leap days and years. The most recent leap day added in year 2000 was the leap day needed to set the calendar straight for a 1000 years.
The reason why this calendar is compatible with the anno domini calendar is to give the option between counting away from something irrelevant to something current and relevant to modern times like the launch of a global pubic ledger like Bitcoin.
