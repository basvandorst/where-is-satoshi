Yes, its a bot. Within the program there is likely something that either processes the image of text in certain fonts into actual text or, if imgur has this feature (not sure if it does,) the program may be able to read the text that the user entered in the form to create the meme. It then autocomments on any thread that uses an imgur link providing the meme name/corresponding text. The main idea behind transcriber bots is for those who have internet blocked at their viewing locale and the like
