some people didnt want to increase the blocksize, so bitcoin cash did
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:03:07
Exactly, people keep saying that bitcoin is a store of value and not a means of transactions. That's some fucking bull shit, because there are so many more coin that have a fixed supply to be used as a store of value, and are able to make transactions better, as we speak.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:50:42
And you dont think how the nature of lightning works, it wont be more centralized than it is now?

"a Bitcoin transfer with a $100 fee that it may take weeks."
You are a fucking liar, he did not even say that... lol
Re watch the video around 2:30 and type out what he said word for word, and then re read it to yourself a couple times to yourself so you can comprehend it you kid.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:19:42
Go ahead, it's reddit lol. It just proves the point I was trying to make
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:05:09
I mean, there's no way to tell, I want it to work, I don't take sides, I believe in crypto, I just want people to have an open mind and not immediately bash the other side 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:11:08
Yea, I'm sure that node will be used a lot over a bank with a node who has a couple million dollars, who can monitor all the transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:49:43
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:07:13
Yes but you have to keep btc on the node, and the amount of btc able to pass through that node is the amount that you keep on it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:04:51
Maybe bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:34:14
Grow the fuck up. You are even worse than the people calling it core, and if you dont see that, you are like the rest of them. Bitcoin, and Bitcoin cash.

I think Roger did absolutely fine. :)
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:52:07
I sent a small about of BTC to that scam exchange and got it back through my paypal so I thought it was legit and bought 1 BTC from coinbase, sent it in and  haven't heard anything. There goes 3 weeks of work busting my ass at a warehouse down the drain. I'm a dumbass. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 10:55:59


Yes you would have to trust me, so I understand if you don't do it. But if you have used Paypal before, just send the payment to my paypal address Ohmymemories After I receive it, Ill send whatever you sent me to your bitcoin address on blockchain.info.
If you havn't used paypal and don't have any money in it, it might take just as long to confirm your bank/credit card there and I'd just stick with circle. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:34:14
You can send me 6$ to my paypal and ill send you 5 dollars USD worth of bitcoin to you.  Ill need the payment first though, I'm not looking for no negotiating scam shit. Let me know
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:25:17
Waste of Time.  Just buy a dollars worth or more from coinbase or circle.  If you dont have any of the required material, Try Localbitcoins or purse.io.

I had 1 successful transaction of 10 dollars to see if it worked, and reseived my money about 15 minutes after the email confirmation.  
Sent another transaction of 1 BTC but after almost 2 hours not even an email confirmation. 
I was gonna do a whole lot more, but i'm starting to think I'm glad i didn't.. 
Keep updating 
@_date: 2015-12-13 07:04:51
honestly a waste of time, just get a job at McDonalds and work 30 minutes and buy BTC, you just made how much you would of made of 24 hours of doing that.
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:12:54
How long does it usually take for your funds to show up via paypal after selling at thebitcionexhanbe.io? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:11:53
Well if you are right, ill keep using it but not until i see my money. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:18:48
ok, cool. Agian, Circle would be a better bet because there is no fee and they are more reputable. But I could send you the money right away if you need it sooner. Just email me and let me know
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:41:55
There is no market correction on bitcoin. It does whatever the hell it wants to do 
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:19:49
I sent in a test 1 BTC about 2 hours ago and still haven't received anything. Not even an email conformation. I hope your right if so ill keep using. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:50:12
How long does it usually take? I just sent in a BTC for a test to see if it worked, haven't got an email in about an hour. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 10:14:49
if you want you can send me 11.50 to cover paypal fee and i can send you 10 dollars worth of bitcoin. Let me know.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:06:16
Memxries is my Twitter, I invested in bitcoin before 2013 you can check my tweets, I participated in the ethereum crowd fund which got 50 ether for free. I hardly use reddit, I come to decisions on my own by learning about cryptos on my own, using them on my own, coming up with my own thoughts. I don't follow the leader or the crowd.
My comment that you down voted stands true, but it conflicts with your beliefs so it angers you.
I'll keep doing what I have been doing, and you keep doing you. Good luck

1LJE2hizQJgHh7vjWjm52UzUc59pDSqozf sent 1 BTC over 8 hours ago and not even an email. And I was gonna send 10 BTC lol "wipes sweat off head"  but some people are saying they got there money, maybe they are just experiencing high traffic?

It can be transparent - this is a good thing for charities and such, people can see where all the money is going, which will motivate all other charities ect, to put the most money in the right place

No u little kids don't need credit cards :p
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:15:43
Thanks, I think I will do this 
@_date: 2014-08-26 18:17:43
Instantly, or within minutes is tuff. Bc without a credit card, people can receive bitcoin and then charge back to get there money back.
But I think coinbase is instant after you verify a credit card, if not it takes several business days.  
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:44:48
Where can I buy them? Lol
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:08:59

I use Coinbase to buy my coins ^_^ 
If you ever get a large amount of coins id recommend to put them on a paper wallet.
Mycelium is an amazing smartphone wallet as well.
Good luck 500 bits for you @_date: 2014-05-08 06:30:21
Just made an account on changetip. Curious on how this works X) Thanks 100 bits Was curious on how to receive tips, could any of you tip me/me tip any of you on his post or only the OP can receive tips?
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:20:26
I just bought a 1btc at 508 hopefully it was a good move &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:00:06
Anyone else think we may have a bit to many merchants accepting it? Almost all merchants who accept btc instantly covert it back into fiat and put it back into the free market. I'm know economist, but is this bad for btc? I really don't no =S
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:01:31
im really looking forward to this
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:17:20
bitcoin is always going down if you look at it, we can some random large leaps up, but then it slowly trends down. We will probably be in the 400's again.
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:04:03
This most be it, I didn't give my address out, also if u look at my changetip, all I do is tip others..

I think i'm to late, but good site none the less :)

can i torrent it yet? ^^
@_date: 2014-05-03 00:44:01
I wonder if more would not be afraid of the price if we start to give the value of a single bit to fiat 
@_date: 2014-05-08 07:12:31
Never been tipped, mostly bc i have no friends. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:22:20

You can buy drugs with money to, I don't they would suspend you for that, or even talking about drugs themselves. 
I don't think your teacher is that stupid lol
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:05:39
No problem man ^_^ 
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:27:43
wow I just actually thought about this for the first time.  
you create an address totally offline, never connect it to the Internet, and u are able to look it up on the blockchain and send coins to it, and see it holding the coins. 
shit, I think I'm mind blowing myself, I need to think about this a bit more to make since of this &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:14:05
Exchange real money for bitcoin via coinbase, or sell something for bitcoins
@_date: 2014-09-02 09:39:10
maybe if storj was out, fark centralized cloud storage XD
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:39:21
Well I thought I made a right move when I bought 300 dollars worth when it was @ 500 &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:41:31
I mean if you think about it, the price cant go to much lower or the a whale can just buy every bit thats available, and if it gets to much lower and the price is steady, Why wouldnt everyone put most there saving in it bc it works well and it can only mostly go up &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:28:19
do they have a watch only option? the only wallet I seem to fine with this feature is the blockchain.info wallet. And its been acting up, getting a network error, looking to change wallets
@_date: 2014-06-01 08:08:59
It's decentralized trust, Something that has never been done before. It's not just a currency but a protocol which you can build other applications on top of.
Its a new frontier of innovation, prepare for the future my friend
@_date: 2014-09-20 08:54:22
Just think, the adoption of bitcoin is pretty settled in my eyes, most tech savvy ppl are in it or dwindling into it, but every day thousands of coins are created and mined and put into the market, I think the price will slowly keep decreasing unless we get a Mainstream boom. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:27:53
Youtube review? you should do one ^_^
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:23:54
But the max off circle, then the max off coinbase XD
@_date: 2014-07-20 09:24:00
how come they still don't have the Philippine peso support in the exchange rate? seems to me that the phillipines are a big adopter of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:46:17
But the same number of btc is bring mined and sold put into circulation, this may not be the bottom :p
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:03:15
I was gonna get a new ducky mechanical keyboard with my btc =( but checked another hard drive which was sold by Newegg and I used btc :D
@_date: 2014-08-17 03:02:46
Im running a full node on my PC, but I store BTC on my computer ever lol. I only keep mine on my Phone :/
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:51:38
As the price continues to drop lol, I predict 575 by the end of the year.  
@_date: 2014-09-19 08:45:00
Holy shit I'm poor right now &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2014-05-03 00:33:57
You are comparing it to dollars
@_date: 2014-05-02 00:47:45
I use coinbase without a problem, you can also setup recurring payments with them, only one thing is a wish they would lower the fee cost &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:16:49
BTC is def. easier to give/receive over the Internet to random people. I don't know you, but I like you, so here is 100 bits How awesome is that :P
@_date: 2014-08-30 05:15:21
4600$ in my checking, 2.5 BTC in my BTC wallet lol
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:05:21
for most people they would use a card to buy, which defeats the point, If i could work for Bits, pay my rent in Bits, I'd almost completely switch lol
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:07:26
I understood fully, I new that if something happened I would it lost my coins, I was just lazy to but the backup on a separate device in time, nothing not the apps fault by any means

100 bits verify

People pay for cloud storage, and I wouldn't be getting paid for nothing. Have u ever of people renting  out a house? They aren't getting paid for nothing, I'm sure if I rented out 3TB of storage I wouldn't get rich doing it. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:28:37
Thanks for the info. Ill take a look at BitGo. And from what I'm understanding Blockchain.info is still more secure then Electrum from a hackers  point of view
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:43:03
yea, I'm sure everyone around you has it like that bc it's available , but when I say rare, I mean globally, it's extremely rare. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:07:58
I should of put the backup on a flashdrive or sd card, it was on my internal storage of my phone
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:12:29
Put in the 6 grand that you have made all into bitcoin??? ^^
@_date: 2014-07-02 09:12:28
If the price ever increased that much, I don't think we would be comparing BTC to dollars anymore...
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:56:55
I purchase bitcoin at coinbase, I have a paperwallet in a safe. This way u can send bitcoin to it whenever u want without ever having to take it out, u can watch transaction go into it but u cant spend from it. Then I have a second wallet on my phone for btc that I use with not as much.
This is how i use bitcoin :D
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:04:12
I was thinking, what if exchanges displayed there price in mBTC, I'd bet we'd get a swarm of new  adopters lol

@_date: 2014-05-16 08:53:14
I agree, If mBTC was the new BTC, so many more people would buy a couple. No joke, almost everyone of my friend ive told about bitcoin wont buy none for this reason.  I even tell them that they can by fractions of 1 BTC. But they still won't buy. I told another friend that i own .55 BTC and he lol'd at me
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:09:08
It was backed up on my note 2's internal storage, which got a factory reset. I've looked for it, and tried to recover all day today. I've pretty sure its lost

@_date: 2014-05-31 09:08:27
I hear you man, and I am frustrated with my self, thing was i was using blockchain wallet for the longest time with a backup and just switched to the new bitcoin wallet, and forgot to duplicate my backup. It's 100 on me, and lesson is learned
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:25:54
I reached 1 BTC when the price was around 500 I've probably spent 700 dollars for it all together, even though I've been in the whole for a bit, I'm still proud of my 1 BTC lol. I wish you luck man
@_date: 2014-05-03 00:12:19
Can I have a couple dollars for a drink?  This is gonna be hard to do with bitcoin in the mainstream. It's hard for people to not compare bitcoin to the dollar, I think it's one reason dogecoin is doing ok. They see coin an one object 
Do u take doge? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:04:25

You can encrypt your seed with a password, but if there is a option to prompt you for the password when opening electrum, or when sending  funds let me know, because I don't see it. Lol
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:25:48
I think your situation is very rare with no fees. But in the end, you are trusting someone to pull out the right amount of money from your bank. Bitcoin you are giving them the amount you want in your control. And they cannot take out any more or any less.
And as a receiving payment processor, it also has a lot more pros. So in most cases, you are helping the merchant buy using bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:52:51

It's cloud storage, such as Dropbox and Google drive, except this is decentralized unlike drop box, and I'm actually looking to get paid for renting out my drive space that I don't currently use, until I use it.   It's a wonderful concept, it just depends on how they implement it.

You are really keeping that much money on an exchange? even still after u lost on gox? O.o
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:19:17
When I watched the video, I wasn't giving this impression at all... To me they made it clear that if you have coins on there site, they store them, Just like coinbase does... but they use multi sig.
@_date: 2014-06-05 10:46:55
Plan it out before hand so its not tedious and confusing.  Try not to sound like a preacher lol, Good luck

Im about to buy some right now at 530, Get ready, the price is about to go down to 500 just bc im buying some :)
@_date: 2014-06-09 19:02:42
Does coinbase have a limit? I'm pretty sure I buy less than 20 dollars worth all the time 
@_date: 2014-09-01 07:01:06

@_date: 2014-05-20 16:46:19
490 :O
@_date: 2014-05-13 09:37:13
in an ideal situation it should gain value over time on its own, but it has a small market cap and its very volatile 
@_date: 2014-06-08 08:36:23
well, if its worth 10x, i dont think you would have to sell, just buy..
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:45:26
I think 1 bitcoin being able to be divided into smaller fractions would happen  before that would.
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:47:56

Or its in the bull trap stage of the bubble

Not everyone is automatically aware that this situation will occur, especially now that it's more popular. Learning takes time.. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:34:12
Its still very stressful, hard to market myself abroad, dealing with scammers, I've been scammed numerous times on both ends

Bitcoin price is pretty high, Steam Sales are great, Im pretty much getting these games for free right now lol
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:34:41
So when I move my btc, to another paper wallet, it will be on the new chain and my old private key will still have the bcash I can sell? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:24:14
I got scammed a full bitcoin back when it was 400 dollars, i sent it to a fake exchange trying to do some arbitrage trading. Also, sold a lot of my bitcoin when it went from 200$ to 500$ pretty fast.

I'm from Venezuela, my main source of income is via bitcoin with free-lance online graphic design work. Bitcoin is worth more on the black market here, because of the difficulty of acquiring it. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 02:40:34
Keep it in bitcoin and maybe buy yourself a present with bitcoin :)

So what I have learned is if I have a private key from long ago (paper Wallet) I can import that private key to a BCash wallet, and I will have both BCash there, and BTC still on my original private key?

But another thing you have to think about is all those currencies aren't Global. So for someone like me, who lives in the US, certainly not going to use any other currency besides USD

@_date: 2015-11-03 05:50:28
Well then you can donate me your .2 so you can have that nice whole number of 0.
Or your second option is to just use bits, 200,000 bits seems like a pretty nice number  ;^)

Whats the next best exchange for new people? I always liked coinbase because of their UI, so I'd always recommend it. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:02:19

@_date: 2015-11-14 06:17:38

I think at this point, hard drive prices havnt dropped in quite awhile, hard drives are becoming irrelevant since SSDs are coming around, also storage is ao big and cheap now for the average consumer there is know need to lower the price much more. Speed is  now top priority over size.
