Then how are they claiming not being developers? And why do they not have a resource that contributes to the source? They are either a contributor to the code or not.  giving 25k to bitcoin foundation isn't the same as contributing.  It's not like they don't have coders.  you can't complain that nobody is fixing something, when you can damn well fix it yourself (mt. gox). lol

also they have an direct ratio of returns on hardware compared to the GH growth of the network (the higher it rises, the more we have to buy to keep up), it would be stupid to risk brand trust to make a few quick bucks.   at this generations hardware peak they will make more money than we do. In addition, they will make a lot of money on the way up.  this is a **myth** argument

Mining speed doesn't effect the "amount" of BTC created.  In any long term analysis, it should be treated as a constant.  2nd the higher the hash rate becomes, the more expensive it is to create BTC, there by causing liquidity as the miner sells/spends BTC in a race to the top.  Once cost/value nears equalizing the race stops, and hardware purchases slow, until some one makes whatever ASIC 2.0 is going to be.  At this point, the miner will be spending most of his/her BTC just riding the wave to the next invention.  The mining process keeps new bitcoin fluid  except in the very beginnings of hash rate growth.
Edit: None of this is new when examining history.  There were people running a bunch of computers in a room during CPU mining (Or using company/university labs/production equipment).  we've all seem pictures of giant CPU/FPGA rigs.  And now asics, there will be a lot of the same big and small players only few variables change:
Power usage, Hash speed, Hardware costs, and rate of deployment.  But the curve is always same with the variables.  if anything has happened, hardware and power usage has gotten cheaper in accordance with Moore's law.  There is no crisis here, move along, nothing to see.

it would require the same kind of limiter used for the production of bit coins when bit mining.  I guess you could think of them as "trade coins", but I would never call them that(voucher maybe?).  The act of processing trades would be generating an appropriate amount of vouchers that would be issued to exchanges contributing to the global trade engine.  This would then slow the trading down and limit the volatility.  It would most likely also increase demand.  I'm not sure it's a sound idea, I'm just saying it would be non-centralized regulator on the trading system.  There are quite a few details that have to be thought through, but it could be possible
edit: Vouchers would allow a certain number coins to be exchanged for $$ outside the system &gt;&lt; sorry I forgot to type that
edit: also I'm not saying this is viable or the approach to be taken.  there are many hurdles in this approach, mainly verifiable information that it's a cash trade a.k.a. money account information would have to be verifiable to the distributed nodes processing the information

This is a fixation on a single facet or channel within the bitcoin network.  There are several arenas that are useful to the user and have lead to this success:
* cold storage/savings of currency
* micro trading - support the needs of people who enjoy it
* long term investment 
* mining - geeks/hardware people who are investing in distributed processing power and create backbone of bitcoin for payouts from the system
* cash currency conversion and transfer
* business opportunities for bitcoin services (VC investment)
all of these aspects contribute to bitcoin's success.  Some of them can stand on their own.  As the Bitcoinia (love this term, it's not my creation) population/participation grows in these various channels, the stability, value and trust does as well.  So unless, all or most of these channels fail at once, I don't believe in system collapse.  We can't obsess on a specific channel all doom and gloom like without factoring in the system as a whole.  one channel in free market system does not control the whole.  One node failure is temporary and a bunny will quickly jump in there to fill the gap.  It will suck for some, but if your coming in, please oh please be educated on risk.  Or use the localized/instant currency conversion for payment.  There are many 2nd/3rd world economies and 1st convenience users who need that service just to conduct business on net. In the case of many 2nd/3rd world countries, many of their currencies are not supported by internet businesses.  This is in no way the whole of the system. This does not define bitcoins success.  It only strengths a portion of it.  I will take anyone, anywhere, in anyway who wants to participate, no matter how long they stay in or go out.

lol said it above, but.  No more bitcoins being generated does not mean miners will not be receiving bit coins and injecting them into the system.  With the volume of trade that would be in a system that big, the trasaction fee (which would be very tiny to the transaction, but large in the transaction volume the miner processes). Those would then be spent(a good portion anyhow) on funding the miners operation and personal expenses. This in turn injects flow of money into the system.  
There is no need to produce more currency, because all that happens in a system like this is the valuation of a "dollar" slides down a decimal place.  With the current limit double the worlds wealth will be able to be store in the next to last decimal.  The most likely thing that would be done, if it's ever needed, is new fractional decimals added.  At this point, you might view your wallet and say omg I have 200 milli BTC in my wallet, I'm rich!
I hope that helps :)

As a note, by the time all the bitcoin is found, there will be a huge number of transactions being process (transaction processing, verification, and committing occurs during the mining process) and with the processing power on the network it will still be profitable to continue solving the equation based on the micro transaction fees.

They secure the buy order on their exchange prior to processing the transaction for the business.  that's how they can do it with no loss, it's quiet easy when  your running your own exchange and most of the businesses performing this function are doing.  Processing would look like this:
* secure buy order
* recieve BTC from purchaser
* execute transaction
if cancel:
* release buy order back to pool
it's important to note most businesses "accepting bit coins" are not in fact accepting bitcoins into a wallet.  They are forwarding customers to a bitcoin exchange. They then process the purchase against their trade engine on behalf of the business effectively making a bitcoin transaction an instant localized currency transaction

The only way to be almost certain your funds will not be taken is the following:
* create the wallet on a freshly installed OS that has never been on a network (linux is the likely choice there)
* create multiple paper copies of your private key and store them securely (safety deposit box and a home safe)
* if you transfer BTC from your cold storage, you create a new private key and immediately send what's left to the new wallet
otherwise you are risking someone stealing your shit. .. .the more money that's in it, the more likely it is to be stolen
the security measure must cost the thief more to break than what it contains
Edit: I can explain why if anyone cares enough to listen
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:42:12
* the fresh install on a non-network computer makes sure your keys can NEVER be transmitted
* multiple paper copies (geologically distributed) makes sure if your house burns down, you don't lose your house and your bitcoins
* if you transfer bitcoins from cold storage, your private keys need to be re-created, because the only way to break sha256 is using a signed message (a bitcoin transaction is an example), even with quantum technology . .. a wallet that has never transferred a coin can not be broken even with a quantum chip (for now at least)
Edit: with armory you can store the keys on USB, when your ready to transfer you then create a transaction you can sign on an offline computer.  then you create new wallet, copy the public key using usb and transfer the remainder to the new "clean" public wallet

Well my point is 250 really isn't that much, if you look at it from a global economy perspective.  In the long run (granted this bubble was cause by publicity and greed trading), 250 is low value for 1 BTC if the currency globalizes.  Gradually (hopefully these shenanigans ease up), the active currency will slide down the decimal places as it becomes more widely distruted.  aka 1 dollar in a few year will be .0001 BTC.  We will see and I will enjoy watching the story unfold

The degree of security should be based on what your coin is worth.

I will agree with saying reapportionment. that is caused when some people time their transition appropriately and others do not, but that's free market.  at least here it's an even playing field with transparency.
As to mining. . . asic is a needed advance, remember not only are we mining, but the processing power we are committing to the process not only solves the "riddle", but does all the transaction processing in the process (the "riddle" solution process involves processing the transactions).  So we have to have this growth.  Buy some asic hardware if you want in, admittedly it does raise the bar for entry (is non-consumer hardware). . .I wouldn't invest in GPU mining, unless you already have some and are doing it now, or just need some new graphics cards lol.

They would get on your exchange in the last 5 secs before processing using the realtime exchange's rate and get discount/profits over the realtime exchanges. Selling they would either get a profit margin (by setting a price) or better (or nothing). Buying I'd either get a small discount (again, by setting a price) or better.  I'm not sure these two exchange types would be able to co-exist.  The only way to mitigate that would to be to introduce a "cool down" period after bidding closes that exposes late bidders to a similar risk as an early bidder, relative to the real time exchanges.  This would essentially escrow bid funds to equalize risk exposure relative to the real time exchanges. Basically, this would create a bidding window and a cool down window.  There would be no real time passage for processing (sub second), due to the simplistic nature of the matching algorithm (essentially could be implemented in a relatively simple sql statement).  
more issues I see while talking about this:
* the longer the bidding cycle(bidding and cooldown) the less attractive this offering would be when run side by side with ContEx
* without cool down windows, near time (later) bids placed have a better market advantage and ended up being heavily stack (tons will show up late in the game)
* late game trader stacking would turn it into a slow version of a continuous exchange that turns itself on and off voluntarily 
* some of the weakness is because back in the day when this was used in new york this was face to face trading not run on worldwide high-speed computers, while we can simulate this, It has many weaknesses in the real time world of the web.
edit: even with cooldowns, late game bidders still have an advantage, just also some risk too

that is untrue, imo. you have notice the decimals on BTC? its a 1 that has 8 decimals. so the over all volume of the currency and availability for distribution is determined by the least significant digit.  but that digit needs to be valued enough to be useful in a transaction.  so if we're  actually talking about using it as a global currency consider this:
1) global wealth is estimated to be 40-80 trillion usd
2) there are currently 11020850 BTC
3) valuing .00000010 to be equal to 1 dollar is enough currency to represent all the wealth on the planet.  and still leave a fractional increment
4) that doesn't account for the coins still to come (even if they are limited)
it not a question of if bitcoin could be the currency of the world, because that's just valuation.  it's a matter of whether it can be trusted enough by the world to carry the value it would take to do so.

Glad you asked this question :) their market has self contained supply lines (domestically produced products), supply lines with limited foreign exposure (partial imports), and are paid in the same currency they are spending.  so the fluctuations are shielded to limited smaller portions of their buy power (ask an Australian how this feels or watch the gas price in a country with heavy imports. . .the gas price thing you can see in the U.S.) 
Actually this use the gas example.  so, instead of using local currency (USD in my case) I pay for a product with gasoline @ $4 USD.  3 days later that gas could have dropped 40 cents (and has on many occasions) and that could kill some merchants depending on their margins.  
Since no product is produced using bitcoins as payment for labor, goods and services, then the purchasing power of bitcoin is dependent on the relative value swing of the exchanges and the localized currency fluctuations.  so waiting 3 days for payment would not be an option, even if it was adopted.  This is most likely the reason bitcoin will always be a cash in hand system.

I need an exchange so I can move to BTC.  otherwise everyone would have to abandon their current wealth and mine BTC. and there would be no equatable value to purchase good from vendors while we wait for the world to move more towards a BTC currency.

Here is  a list of Khan Academy videos:
I'd would watch them just to put in your mind how to simply explain things to your audience.  If you are handing out any media, point them to this for "further reading".  It's a great set.  You might consider the playing the "Proof of work video" when you discuss:

There is an entire well established tech stack and set of design patterns that were born from the .com boom that do distributed transactions.  I spent most of my life doing them. ...unless I've been transported back to the 80s. . .

that's an instpay system, they already exist and cost much less than many other CC systems business already use.

Wealth is preserved by long term investment in bitcoin.  This is why most of the people who have currency portfolios are now considering investing in bitcoin as a diversified investment. . .  In this case the wealth they have invested in other currencies deminish as bitcoin pushes a larger market share (BTC market cap increases), then their loss is offset by growth in their BTC investment.  As they see more Market cap growth (transfer of wealth and value into BTC), it will occupy a larger portion of their portfolio.  No wealth will be lost, they are safe.  As for commodities and business/stocks, they will begin investing in bitcoin by utilizing the currency more and more. Their supply chains/production costs may use BTC eventually as well, either as currency conversion (intantpay) and transfer tool (to lose transaction fees).  So investments in stock will be safe especially since they have relative value against many different currencies.  The only person risking wealth will be an idiot who lets money stay in a single localized cash form and owns no BTC.  (people who don't respond to changing market conditions because they are dumb).  As all of these things are happening, the number of players in the bitcoin arena increase and stability naturally occurs.  No one is going to hold all the BTC, because they have to eat, pay bills, buy hardware, services and hookers.  Even the miners have electricity bill and hardware to buy so the cash will flow.  your argument that it's a destruction of wealth is false.
edit: since there will always be some flow of BTC, the value of BTC goes up, and people looking to enter will enter the market with fraction of BTC that have the same value of their current currency based wealth

Just wanted to add one more thing:
A public key can tell  you nothing about the private key (which secures your wallet) until you use the private key to make a transaction.  this signing is then verifiable with the public key (sorry getting all techno crypto here). That's how the network knows you have the right to send funds, BUT by sending that message you have now revealed some "clues" that reveal a small amount of information about your private key.  Once sha256 (the core of bitcoin) is broken, then somebody could possible go back and "recognize" the clues to reverse engineer your private key.  the currently only feasible way this "could" happen is with quantum computers (which is why a lot of crypto peeps get freaked by them).  That is why you would want to make a "clean" cold storage wallet after sending ANY transaction.  Anyhoooooooo that's the theory hate/love me for it, but I've spent my days in the code mines learning this stuff.

Also this the same argument I'd use for people to stop selling their BTC.  If they actually believe in BTC they need to realize whats going on now is a drop in the bucket.  The amount of deflation that will occur against 1 BTC ,as the currency is adopted, would make it worth thousands or millions of dollars later in the economy.  so selling and buy BTC to game the system for 40 dollars is stupid and will one day take your balance to zero. a balance that if you sat on it for a the long haul could be worth way more money than you will see messing with system for a few buck.
Edit: I suck at typing

Yep. . . namecoin is actually the only thing that has "potential" to be as useful as Bitcoin.  Happily the co-exist quite nicely together.

Much like how mining pools payout. . . . so I doubt the miners will have have sympathy for people wanting to super low fractional pennies

it would benefit no one as all participants would lose in this scenario.  There are plenty decimals and, as the valuation of the us dollar/euro slides down them, it becomes less and less desirable to do so. regardless of it even being possible
edit: and only the participants can make that decision

This whole method is how a hardware wallet works.  It secures the  private key by holding it on an offline microprocessor that handles the transaction signing.  Most people don't understand the underlying file formats and hardware of iTunes and iPods, but they use them every day.

That's a tool answer and barely makes sense, much less worth answering. I've built systems capable of handling many thousands of transaction a second.  Using asynchronous messaging and stateless transactions over highly distributed (aka scaled out) hardware configurations.  They used private linux apt-get depos for deployment that basically allowed plug and play server expansion (processing power through scaling).  These operated over vpn tunnels on public networks and private hardlines.  Many of the servers were deployed offsite and coordinated transaction across physical boundries. so unless you got something more than one ignorant sentence you got no clue. . .sorry, but I'm tired of want-to-be tech peeps confusing a situation with uninformed flippant commenting
edit: also, they were real cash systems that traded what would now be called virtual currency for monetary rewards
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:00:19
and non of the benefits (chinacoin) they still need learn why you would do this then. . .lots of learning left for them

Because they write papers does not mean it's public domain.   Unless they say they aren't interested in patenting the discoveries and their applications. . . .a listing of peer review papers does nothing for me

le sigh. . .by time we get to that point, bitcoin will either be an established currency and valued well above what it is now or be long dead. 
In the case of the former, there will be micro-transaction fees that will more than support the miners and encourage processing power growth. due to shear volume of the amount of transaction and the crazy growth in power of the mining technology, it will be so small you probably will never even notice it. Or you can opt not to pay it and wait for processing by on of the smaller "charity" nodes I'm sure will show up. But don't you worry about those miners, they won't be going anywhere.
In the case of the latter, well we won't be worried about the miners either.  Because we will all be looking back missing that time when we participated in something that inspired laughter, tears, anger and joy. Then we will  crawl into our micro home and watch youtube.

general speaking, you can either use a distributed data base or scale up the database hardware, but from what we're seeing mt gox is using two tier spagetti code

except by the time you got the BC you'd have no idea the value of the transaction
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:33:11
also no one would mine the other chain, because none of the supporting facilities(users, exchanges, and vendors) would accept it as a transaction, but it or trade it. Follow a fork would be a total waste of time, resources, and effort

this is all about population growth and suppy/demand. we have fixed assest (ish) and more people coming in.  it will be wild for a while, but the population of bitcoin will never go back to what it was. . . barring us exploding in a ball of flame mt. gox style lol
