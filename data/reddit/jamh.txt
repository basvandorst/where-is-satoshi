Not all people utilize cloud storage, most aren't even aware what it is.
Also you have to verify each address after you back up.  It's not as "simple" as you're making it out to be.

@_date: 2014-03-02 22:18:23
This is not convenient at all.  I have all my 2fa accounts in one place (authy in my case, I'm sure other users use google auth), and this is forcing me to download another app, sign up for another account, and use that app just for this one service.
Perhaps add the option to pick between the two?  I dunno I stopped at this step, I have a pretty old phone and try to keep any unnecessary apps off of it for space reasons.  This unfortunately falls into the unnecessary category, for me at least.

@_date: 2014-11-11 13:00:30
The problem was the wallet controlling that address was hosted on blockchain.info and was unspendable due to "no confirmations".  I had checked the other block explorers to make sure the transaction was ok and it showed up fine.
I've always used blockchain.info and never ever had an issue with inaccurate data.  You're not the first person to mention that though so I guess I was just lucky until now.

What your asking for is for whoever (or whatever) you buy your btc from to take a HUGE risk trusting you to not request a chargeback for the BTC that they are sending you.  You have up to 90 days to do that chargeback.  Once they send you the coins, they have to sit around and pray for 90 days that you don't screw them.  Put yourself in their shoes, would you offer up what you're asking for?
If you don't want to give services your identity, that's fine, but don't expect to use debit/credit/paypal, you're only real option is cash through LocalBitcoins, or find someone local that will sell to you face to face.

My personal experience: Coinbase, followed by Circle.
Why: I've used Coinbase for a LOOONG time now and enjoy their limits and ease of use.  The initial setup is a bit of a pain in the ass and takes about a week, but after that it's smooth sailing.
Circle is easier to setup but they have lower purchasing limits.  For you that might not matter.

So instead of sending over the BTC directly to them, you guys decided on and agreed that it was faster/easier/better for you to send the BTC to seals with clubs (and not gamble with it), wait the two confirmations that they require before crediting your account, change it over to 'chips', and then give those chips over to them so that they can change it back to BTC (or gamble with it, whatever)?

+-5% is actually pretty reasonable. Flat fee wouldn't work. How is operator supposed to make any money? They still have to buy the btc back. So let's say you walk up to his machine and take out 1k of btc. He then has to buy that back. He'll probably buy it back off of circle or Coinbase (unless they keep cash sitting on an exchange, he wants his money back into btc as fast as possible to minimize risk). With your flat fee model he has now lost money and would be better off just to scrap it. At 5% he's maybe made about 20-25 dollars after his expenses on your original $1000. Oooh how greedy

@_date: 2015-01-26 00:53:35
The money transfer begins processing the first business day after you make a purchase.  They first ping your account (I'm not sure what the official financial term is) to see if you have sufficient funds.  If you do, the money will be withdrawn usually the next business day.  The BTC will then show up in your account usually 2-3 business days after that.  I don't see how this would work unless you saw a significant price drop the day after your purchase was started.  
You might have better luck with this if you initiate on a Friday, that would give you the weekend as things won't begin rolling until Monday morning.  Still would not recommend, CB is likely to black flag your account if this happens on a regular basis (or shit even more than once).

They don't need to "crack" it, I said track. As in monitor the blockchain. Yes you're right there's nothing in the code to connect am identity to an address, but that's not the point. They just have to track it to an exchange and get your id from them.
The amount of people using strictly HD wallets AND cash into and out of the system is small. Things like dark wallet aren't usable by the general public yet.

I understand what he was saying, and now reading this I **really** understand.
Maybe the confusion stems from our original interpretations of the pic. I saw it and thought "integrated tipping, wallet software, cool! Needs more security." I got this from how changetip operates now, I'm making an assumption that whatever Reddit does it will compete with changetip (albeit just on Reddit, changetip supports many sites now).
Obviously the guy I was going back and forth saw it as a much simpler system, you supply the address and reddit stays pretty much hands off besides connecting people. I don't see how they could monetize that (and as such why pay a developer to mock it, code it, etc., people can already just swap addresses easily enough).
Obviously neither is right or wrong as this is just a picture and an early implementation of....something, we don't yet know.
Apologies if I came off rude.

Dude you're missing the point. Reddit is thinking about implementing tipping, natively. That means people will have money associated with said  Reddit account. With money being involved in an account, it needs more security than a password.
This was/is a problem when changetip was first introduced. Part of that problem has been mitigated by them being their own service, but it's still a problem. It's why I don't keep anything over a dollar in my changetip account. If someone gets into my reddit account they can just pm the changetip bot and pay themselves.

No, when you sweep them you spend from the multibit private keys into your electrum wallet. You're not adding the multibit keys to your keys or anything, it's just a normal incoming transaction, same as if you'd sent them from any external wallet. Once swept you can safely get rid of the used private keys, you won't be using them anymore.

Start a website like SoundCloud, where artists can go to upload their music, attach a wallet to each artists account, and then a unique receive address for each song that they choose to distribute.  If someone wants to purchase the song, have them send money to that song's address, which once transferred and verified (1 verification, maybe none for faster service), will serve up a unique download link sent to email or whatever for them to download the song, DRM free, and do whatever they want with it.  Have the download link be valid for something like 3 days (or however long you decide).  
Boom, instant music distribution on a song by song basis.  Money straight to the artists.  Then you can start tracking popularity, sales, etc...

I'm probably getting in over my head here, but I trust that the scanning software that we pay for will remove any of those 'changes' that were made.  I also run multiple virus scanners to check that they all say everything is clean.
In the event that it is not clean, and there is something found that I cannot remove (either through anti virus software, manually, or combofix it it's really bad), then I go with a wipe and reinstall.  But definitely not the other way around.

I'm not sure I'm understanding the Ripple process correctly then, can you explain to me how said homeless person would utilize Ripple to help them get out of the cycle of poverty by getting paid in BTC?  Let's for the sake of debate pretend like Bitstamp did not roll out the new requirements.

You're getting away with it by being a burden on your parents, which is fine, but you better give them an appropriate amount of any money you make by sitting on your coins instead of getting your shit done, and eat any losses quietly (Don't ask them for more money if bitcoins shit and you're broke in two currencies now).  
Maybe take them out to dinner if you're going to choose to hold them, something nice for them being nice to you.  Don't just say "rent please, I don't want to spend my other money cuz I didn't plan right"

I kinda feel like another possibility is whoever it is is trying to put a stop on the price on bitfloor from going any higher.  He shows up at the bank when they open, deposits more money, releases the hold, then buy's more coin as the price is still surging because you can just turn around on mtgox and sell, currently it's a 6 dollar difference.  I dunno I might just need to go to sleep

I would argue that one decentralized currency that is not prone to political manipulation is an upgrade from a central bank.
Also as others have stated, having a global currency does not diminish the need or function of local currencies, they will still exist and still have their place.  BTC just changes the global rules.

wait I get it, can't force Bitcoin on naive people, can't force people out of their religious beliefs that you don't agree with?  I guess I can see this.  Where I would differ tho is religion is a belief, it can't really be proved one way or the other.  Bitcoin is just math, anyone can go look and see for themselves.  Just people don't want to look

I can't say for other people.  I've used it.  I met a guy in a reddit thread yesterday who passed me the code for a website project i've been working on.  sent some bitcoins his way.  This type of transaction hasn't been possible before.  Pretty cool feeling actually, getting something useful in your life and paying for it in a 'digital currency' that two years ago most people didn't even say was real.  It's pretty real to me.  I got a service, he got his payment.  Everyone was happy.

He does have feedback, and the account is at least two years old.  He's only bought things, and all sellers gave him positive reviews.

I just sold some today to a guy I met through craigstlist.  I met him at the coffee shop up the road from my place.  Makes me feel better to be somewhere public rather than excluded in privacy.  It's not like you're selling drugs, you can do it anywhere that has internet, the sidewalk if you have a cell phone even.  I didn't even make it to the coffee shop he met me outside, gave me money, i scanned his qr code and sent the funds.  We chatted around for about 10 minutes until a verification came through, shook hands, and went about our days.

Like I said, I have no idea.  I bank at a credit union, and my accounts are just listed as "Personal" (checking) and "Share" (savings).  I've never had different numbers, when I deposit or withdraw they just ask me, checking or savings.  With most online stuff, I've given my acct number and the money is always drawn from my checking.

reboot -&gt; safe mode, networking -&gt; update malwarebytes -&gt; reboot -&gt; safe mode, no networking -&gt; scan.  If clean, reboot -&gt; safe mode -&gt; combofix -&gt; if nothing found, reboot normally, run normal virus scanner.  If nothing found, at this point I'm satisfied the machine is clean.
If, after one of the reboots or scans, it finds new infections or can't remove infections previously found, then I start thinking about planning a wipe/reformat

So I contribute bitcoin to the "ransom", but the entire project doesn't get released until the goal is met, correct? 
What's my incentive to be an early contributor in that case, or to contribute at all? What happens if the goal is not met (an issue for your indefinite ending submissions)? Do my Bitcoins just disappear or do I get them back? 
I think this would be cool if the people contributing get full access to whatever is being sold. But then you lose the right to distribute (as someone else now has a copy and can upload it elsewhere if they want).
I dunno just my thoughts. Good luck!

Satoshi Dice has a secret key that they release after every 24 hours of gaming.  The game works by taking your transaction ID + the secret key and hashing the two together.  He then takes the last two bytes off of this hash to come up with a number, your "Secret Number", between 0 and 65535.  Depending on the bet you take, you will either win or lose.
For example, if you bet on the 50% game, you are betting that your secret number will be less than 32768, out of 65535 possible numbers.  If it is, you win, if not you lose.
Catch is he keeps house odds on every bet, 1.9%.  Continuing with our 50% example, if you win, you only get 1.957 of what you bet returned back to you.  All the bets are skewed like this.
I'll admit, I've played it.  Probably everyone has played at least once.  Why you're getting all the negative responses is because if you play long enough, you will lose.  You're friend recommending it to you should know that.
My advice is to stay away, and if you do play, don't expect any sympathy here or anywhere else when you lose your money.
Have fun, and just remember .01 which is currently the minimum bet is about 88 cents.  Martingale schemes can quickly get out of control very fast, just keep in mind 8 losses in a row at .01 starting point puts you at a 1.28 BTC bet after 8 losses, about $112 dollars.  It's not so fun losing a bitcoin over something so dumb, especially with the price going so high atm.

Yes I am shipping from the US, and I had originally put US shipping only.  I guess the root of my question is how would they go about scamming me?  It's done through PayPall, I'm going to take pictures of everything, tracking number, delivery notice, and signature on receipt.  Is there anything else I should be aware of?  I don't want to pull the money out of PayPal and then in a few months get a charge back or something.  A lot of people around here talk about PayPal's dispute resolution and the fact that a tracking number and delivery notification tend to make them side with the seller, which is why Bitcoin is so problamatic.
Like I said I've never done this before and you hit the nail on the head for why I'm a little nervous about it.

You're missing the fact that the difficulty will rise rapidly now that all the ASIC's are coming out.  Their difficulty increase of 2% a month is not even close with ASIC's releasing.
See [this]( chart, ASIC's came out late January early February.  See the rise?  That's only going to go up faster when BFL starts shipping.  Expect you to be sitting at probably 6+ month back order.

It never matters what the actual 'cost' of a bitcoin is tho, no matter if I want to spend $10 worth of USD on a product, it matters not what the price of bitcoins is at at the current time.  What matters is I wanted something, I paid 10 dollars for it (think dollars to bitcoins then to whoever i sent them to), and i received it.  Everything was instant, I can't issue a charge back on the merchant, thus he doesn't have to raise his prices to protect against such.
Now take that equation and imagine a world where i never have to convert the $10 to bitcoins to make the process happen.  Say i work and get paid in bitcoins and spend them same as with dollars.  Seems pretty efficient to me, but I may just be googly eyed about the technology.
In my mind, bitcoins could crash down to .01 dollars per bitcoin and it wouldn't much matter in my mind.  I still have a way of transfering value from one place to the other.
The price going up is just icing on the cake.

not "might be", it is built in, along with loads of other protocols not yet utilized.  
It's called a 2 of 3 transaction, you introduce a 3rd dispute mediator party to the transaction.  If the buyer/seller party agree that the deal went through and was fair, the deal gets processed, satisfying the 2 of 3 rule.  If the buyer says "hey hold up I didn't get what I was supposed to", the arbiter steps in, if they decide that they buyer is in the right, they side with the buyer, satisfying the 2 of 3, and the money gets sent back to the buyer.  If the arbiter steps in and says "the buyer is lying the seller delivered what was promised", then the arbiter will side with the seller, again satisfying the 2 of 3 and sending the money to the seller.  At no point can the arbiter take the money, they can only decide who gets it.
Again, this isn't "might be written in", it is there, waiting for a company or person to come around and start a service handling these kinds of situations and charging say x% for the pleasure.

how are you transferring your dollars around from exchange to exchange?  The bitcoins are the easy part...
You buy at exchange A for cheap, transfer it to exchange B and sell it for high.  Now you have money in exchange B, where prices are high, but you need to buy in exchange A, where prices are low, to continue this cycle.  What is your plan for this?

just go to their website, do a cash deposit, go to walmart or cvs or wherever and do a moneygram, you can pay for the moneygram with debit.  Be advised, bitinstant charges 4% and moneygram's are $4 I think, so factor that into however much you are trying to spend.

The process was rather simple, actually.  I had to get a business license obviously, then I had to go [here]( to register for an EIN.  After that, I went to [this]( page to actually to the MSB registration.  Once you are registered, there is a link on the side menu titled RMSB (I think, I'd have to log in and double check), and from there I just had to fill in the form with my information.

I try not to mention the price to people when I'm explaining them, I try to put people into situations where bitcoin would be valuable to them.  
Don't say "You can sell them for $150!!!"
Instead say "You can send money to anyone in the world, nearly instant, with minimal fees, and no one getting in the middle."
When people start to realize the potential of the technology, the price just becomes a bonus.

if your bank cannot auto authenticate by just entering in your credentials, they offer the alternative method of making and then withdrawing deposits into your account.  They will randomly make two small deposits, usually less than 50 cents total into your account, then withdraw them later.  To authenticate you have to go back to coinbase and enter in the amounts in.

I deposited there yesterday on three separate occasions.  Money was in my bitfloor account before I got back to my truck.  Very happy with them.  F a Coinbase and waiting 5 days for 'money to transer' (LOL it's funny that I have to wait for money to transfer so I can ditch money transfers and buy a currency that I can send to anyone, anywhere, instantly, but I digress), the price is likely to move $50 in that time.

if you have instant buy you get the BTC at whatever the rate was when you buy, $300 in your case.  If tomorrow the price went up to $350 and you sold you would get that price.  The money won't clear your bank account for a few days, but when it does you'd make $50

I'm sorry I disagree with all your points.  You seem to describe a future situation, right now Ripple is no where close to as useful as you are claiming.  Gateways are almost non-existent, XRP is almost damn near impossible to get your hands on, and [Ripple the company]( is NOT the same thing as the ripple idea that has been floated around by Mike Hearn and others as a decentralized currency exchange, someone simply made a company with the same name and ran with it.
None of your scenario's described how said homeless person would go about getting bitcoin to be useful to their lives.  You speak of trust and trade for person to person goods (using ripple I'm assuming???) but who actually accepts XRP for anything?  Is there a list somewhere?
Thanks for the response though, and I'm not trying to be mean or anything.  I just don't see how any of what you wrote helps in the real world.

The largest exchange volume wise is currently BTCChina. 
For American users the big three are Bitstamp, BTC-E, and CampBX. MtGox gets a lot of hate due to their withdrawal problems but I think they are still relevant. 
Coinsetter is supposed to be opening soon but nothing yet, just beta invites and no USD deposits. 
Kraken is a smaller but promising exchange. Vault of Satoshi is another one. 
Check data.bitcoinity.org for data porn of volume, price, etc.

Bitfloor, at least in America, is much easier to get money into.  More buyers means higher prices.  This is also why BTC-E is always consistently the lowest of all the exchanges, very hard to get money into.
Tell you a secret, if you watch the price difference between Bitfloor and MtGox in the wee early morning (when euro banks are open and america is still closed), you often see this trend flipped upside down.  Like others have mentioned, if you play your cards right, you *could* make some nice returns
Disclaimer, past behavior does not predict the future, and I'm just a dude on the internet.  YMMV
@_date: 2013-04-07 05:29:28

I wouldn't say 'hold' per se, but don't sell them for money.  Spend them, tip them, earn them.  Just don't sell them back to money, unless you need the money of course

And what is gold backed by? It's valuable because people agree it's valuable. Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, it is transparent and anyone can take a look at how it works. The problem with backing an online currency with real world value is that someone, somewhere has to be holding that collateral, introducing centralization in a system that is designed to be decentralized (see e-gold)

@_date: 2013-04-09 02:11:05
ha i sent him a text reminding him that if he felt so inclined, he could just send some btc back to me as more of a 'tip' and a thank you, there was no need with bitcoin to wait until i saw him.  I'm already set up to meet him next Saturday to sell him more, he's getting bitcoin i'm making my peanuts and we're both happy.  He even offered to sell me some of his silver for bitcoins, although I'm a little hesitant as I know nothing about silver and probably won't be a very good judge of silver vs shiny silver looking metal.  Stick to btc for money for now.
dunno maybe you're right, I just got really excited learning a newbie, and like I said, it's important for people like us that know to teach people that don't know so much, bring it down to their level, put them in a situation where bitcoin could make their life more convenient.  Then people really start opening their eyes.

Isn't practical for most things **yet**.  Merchants will adopt as soon as they realize the potential of the technology.  Imagine every McDonald's register having a QR code on them, allowing you to pay for your happy meal just by scanning.  The process is easy as pie, and services such as Bitpay can convert the BTC's back to actual dollars instantly.  Then say mcdonald's supplier starts accepting bitcoins as payment.  Now mcdonalds doesn't have any need to 'convert' back to USD, they get payments from their customers in BTC and they pay their suppliers in BTC.
In my head, this world isn't too far off from where we are today.  All it requires is merchants to wake up and realize that there is a pool of over 2 billion dollars floating around in the internet and people are chomping at the bits looking for places to spend their new coins.  They can spend them on literally anything, from anywhere in the world, and instantly.  If i had an online shop, I'd start selling shit for BTC's yesterday.

Oh I wasn't implying that you try to *force* bitcoin on people, the question was posed why we **can't** use a single global currency.  I'm of the opinion that we can.

    $lastprice = ("".$cur_avg=$decoded['return']['last']['value']."
");
    
    ?&gt;    
That will pull the current value from MtGox and save it as $lastprice.  You can change the currency in the $decoded=mtgox_query('1/BTC**PLN**/ticker');
You have to go to MtGox and get your own API key and secret.

Wow, umm thanks for that!  Very interesting read, although I'm not sure of the point of it.
I ordered my miner when the diff was 6,000,000.  I got it when the diff was about 120 mill, my original expectations were it arriving at around 100 mill so I wasn't too far off.  Like I said earlier, I'm happy with my purchase.  I've made back enough of what I spent on it to where I don't feel totally duped (which was only like 500 dollars for a 13 gh/s machine), and even if btc diff gets to the point where i can't make back costs there are other alt currencies that i can point it at (whoa I just mentioned an alt coin, downvote train incoming!!).  PPC is the one I'm most excited about, I expect to see a huge flood of lower end ASIC's moving to that in the near future, who knows how that will effect the price.
I agree with you, most people who get excited about mining have NO IDEA what they are really getting into, and that's why you see all the negative stuff flying around.  I had to talk a friend of mine out of taking out a loan just to pre-order a BFL machine, all he saw was $$$ in his eyes, it was crazy.
I personally don't recommend any "hobby" miners to get into it at this point, not for money anyway.  I just wasn't sure why I was getting berated for having an ASIC and not being a disgruntled customer...

If you're in the states, try coinbase.  They deposit straight to your bank account, no fees.  Still a 5 day wait but the no fees is nice.  Or start up a local exchange in your town, bitcoins for cash and cash for bitcoins.  You'd help solve the very problem you speak of and probably do pretty well for yourself if you keep a business mind about it.

it doesn't matter if someone aquires 20 million out of the 21 million possible bitcoins and never uses them, **or loses them for that matter**.  The remaining 1 million can still be divided down to use for his "liquidity".

I too, had this happen.  O well, who'd a thunk it.  I saw the lag coming on MtGox, then noticed Bitfloor acting funny.  I almost bought at 260, but thought I'll sit tight and see if MtGox starts to come back up.  Then it got to 245 and started climbing back up, so I was like "cool saved myself $15 dollars", buy.
Then epic nose dive down to $105.  fuuuuuck.
Haha I'm not worried, I was just buying back coins that I  had previously sold for 260 to a guy locally yesterday, so I still came out ahead.  But damn I almost made so much more.  *Just ten more minutes and Bitfloor went down and I would have had to wait for them to come back up at like $150*
Oh well, been a *very* fun day ha

that's why btc-e has the lowest prices, they are hard to get money into.  also why bitfloor usually has the highest prices, easy to get money into.  More buyers means people can charge higher prices.  You'll also notice weird fluctuations in the early am hours when the banks in europe are open and in NA they are closed, the price on mtgox usually goes above bitfloor.  Supply and demand

Link your American bank account with coinbase. Keep whatever money you want to transfer in that account. When you need money, log into coinbase, buy bitcoin, then sell the bitcoin in India for gox price in rupees. Deposit it into your Indian account. 
I don't know about going the other way, depends on how available bitcoin is to buy. 
That's what I would do. Sorry for short response, on my phone.

[Bitfloor cash deposit](
Just deposit at any bank of america, no account required.  they charge anywhere from 1-4% (and it's not even bitfloor that charges you that, it's localtill, the service they use, if you have a capital 1 p2p account transfers are free)
The money is usually in my exchange account by the time i get back to my vehicle, then from there just place an order for your coins.

because if you aren't comfortable with the amount of money you invested, you shouldn't have invested it.
I tell people pretend you buy $X amount of bitcoins, in your case $5000.  Now pretend like you wake up the next morning and bitcoins are worth $0.  Are you ok with that?
If the answer is yes, go ahead and buy bitcoins.  If the answer is no, don't.
My answer is yes.  YMMV

It doesn't matter if the price of bitcoin goes to $1,000,000, most miners (excluding the first few orders of a new gen device) don't make their ROI when priced in BTC.  You're almost always better off just buying bitcoin and holding than you are mining.

coinbase just gives the mtgox value plus 1% I believe.  Bitfloor is back up, trading just under 90 as of posting this
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:45:28
I checked [here]( and it says it up, but I can't login.  Not from my phone, my laptop, or a proxy.
Whatever, the price is tanking on mtgox so I'll just wait to buy anyway.

Yes we do, and you saw how close we brought the whole world to the brink of financial disaster because 1 group of 144 Republicans decided to stick their head's up their asses (sorry for discussing politics in here but **FUCK** that was/is embarrassing)

Merchants can choose to accept unconfirmed transactions.  It's all about amounts really.
If you're selling a house, wait for the 6 confirmations.
If you're selling milk, you're probably ok with accepting unconfirmed transactions.
It's about the cost to attack the network and the risk of double spend, it diminishes exponentially with each confirmation (or block solved, they are the same thing).

So I really don't mean to sound cynical here so bear with me ***but*** why should I utilize your service over say something like Coinbase?  I'm stateside so I might not be your target market at the moment, but Coinbase seems to be offering a service very similar to yours (secure storage of bitcoins, 90% of which are held in cold storage, etc.).  One of my favorite things about Coinbase is that they will take care of any BTC fees on any outgoing transactions, a small gesture but nevertheless a meaningful one.  Now compare that to you, a 3% withdrawal fee or a monthly fee.
I guess I'm asking you to sell me on your service, why should I deposit?
Your POS service looks AWESOME, is that along with the BTC debit cards your selling points and I'm just being a nit picky asshole or am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-10-19 05:43:00
I've had no fee transactions take as long as two days.  If you want your BTC right away, pay the fee.  If not the network will pick it up when it gets around to it.
Miners can opt to only mine on transactions that have a .0001 fee or above for instance, and any transactions with fees that are lower than that will not get included in any blocks that they try to mine.  This means that you have to wait around for a miner with a lower fee threshold to mine your transaction, in your case a miner who accepts 0 fee transactions.  Obviously miners want blocks with bigger fees included in the reward, but if they set their threshold too high they will not receive enough transactions.
This is the 'democratic process' you sometimes hear about when people talk about changing fee schedules (or any part of the bitcoin protocol for that matter), you can't just force it, the miners have to accept it.  
You just have to wait.

Hey it's a start.  My apartment is managed by one of those large companies, doubt they'll be on the list.  I'll check it out.
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:45:44
I posted this earlier, maybe it can help you.
* Offline Wallets (can be used for cold storage)
 * [Bitcoin-qt]( - this is the original bitcoin client.  It requires you to download the entire block chain, something many people don't need.  Give's access to wallet encryption, as well as backup and restore.  A good starting point
 * [Armory]( - runs on top of bitcoin-qt, provides access to many features for advanced users.  I recommend this if you have a large amount of bitcoins that you want to keep safe.
 * [Multibit]( - Lightweight wallet, I have not personally used this one.  I don't think it requires you to download the blockchain
 * [Electrum]( - Another lightweight wallet, does not require the entire blockchain to be downloaded, it uses a remote server.  Again, have not tried this one out
* Online Wallets (Do not recommend for long term, as these accounts technically live on a server that you don't own)
 * [Blockchain.info]( - The most popular and widely used online wallet.  Allows for 2 factor authentication, cloud backups, etc. 
 * [BIPS Online]( - Another online wallet service, also functions as an exchange.  Also offers offline cold storage and wallet importation
 * [Instawallet]( - Online wallet that randomly generates a wallet key for you when you first go there.  The idea is you can bookmark that page, and then no one else can be served up the same wallet page.  Good for moving coins quickly, but I wouldn't use it for long term storage (anything longer than a day probably).  
 * [Brainwallet]( - Pretty cool implementation of a wallet, you just give it a phrase, can be whatever you want it to be, and so long as no one can guess the phrase no one can get to your wallet.  Again, I wouldn't trust it for very long to store coins.
* [Mt.Gox]( - Obviously the 800 lbs. gorilla in the room.  You can place market orders, or just set prices you want and go to sleep.  They charge a 0.6% transaction fee on every transaction that you make, just keep that in mind.  I've only ever used bitinstant to get money into them, so can't really speak for any of the alternative ways.
* [BTC-E]( - I've heard they are really hard to get money into, but the prices on the exchange are historically lower than Mt.Gox.  They also change around litecoins, if you're into that kinda thing.
* [Coinbase]( - Really convenient if you're in the US, although they've been catching a lot of hate around here lately.  They allow you to buy and sell coins straight through your bank, charging a flat 1% + $0.15 for every transaction, which is the cheapest way I've come across, unless you already have money sitting in Mt.Gox or something like that.  They take a while for orders to go through, but once you place an order they honer the price (so if the price jumps or dips in the 5 days it takes your transaction to go through, you don't suffer/gain from it).  They also have a 10BTC buy and 100BTC sell limit per day at first.  It goes up after you do enough transaction to 100 buy/300 sell.
* [Bitfloor]( - This is the one that I'm going to use for my next BTC buy, personally.  I've heard the process is really painless and fast, and they charge (from their website) anywhere from 1%-4%.  You just have to go to a bank that they work with (Bank of America and I'm not sure what else, it mentions Capital One 360 but I have no idea what that is, nor care) and fill out a deposit slip.  They give you all the information.
* [Tradehill]( - Second try at an American Exchange ('Merica!), just recently opened.  From the looks of it a very nice interface, although I haven't used them or heard much about them.  Added by request
@_date: 2013-05-11 00:11:29

the 2 factor code changes within a small time frame.  You cannot brute force it, it's something like 10,000,000 possibilities that you would have to guess in something like a minute (I don't know exactly the timeout coinbase uses, authy it's 15 seconds).

Thank you for this.  I've saved it for later reference.  We seem to be debating two sides of the same coin.
I was referencing [this video]( this was the first time that I really heard about ripple and got excited about it.  Unfortunately it seems very underdeveloped at this point, hard to get into and hard to use.
I'll admit I have never ACTUALLY used it, as like I said I have not found a way to get my hands on the initial XRP to fund my account, to be honest I don't even know if I'm using the "right" ripple or the ripple scam (I knew about the Bitstamp gateway but I was already turned off to the idea by the time I learned of it).
My ripple address is
    rJV3NP4KnqHTYc3A8Ym3QmbP1MCdd5nUsz
But that is from ripple.com, isn't that the Ripple Scam we are discussing???  Also I can't promise you I'll utilize any XRP you send my way any further than exploring it more than what's available from my "unfunded account" screen, so yea disclaimer I guess, you don't have to if you don't want to.
I appreciate your help and the time you've taken explaining this to me.  It seems like a great concept on paper, just needs better implementation.
More so I appreciate that you aren't a dick about it.  You're cut from the right block of wood as they say.

From my understanding, dollar amounts aren't important, if you are converting one currency to another, you must at the minimum register with FinCEN as an MSB.  As for the $ amount, I believe you have to file a report on anything over $2000 or any "suspicious" transaction or person.

And thank you for your kind words, like I said hopefully my story inspires others to get out there and start spreading the information to everyone and anyone who will listen.
Funny, I told ALL my friends and family that they need to look in on this back when the price was at 40.  No one listened at me (I managed to talk two of my friends into sitting down and hearing me out, both purchased coins immediately after I'd finished our conversation).  Most laughed at me actually, told me that I'd gone a bit too far this time with my, and I quote, "wild internet dreams".  My own mother even told me "do you want money to buy bitcoins or what are you asking?"
NO MOM I WANT **YOU** TO BUY BITCOINS SO YOU CAN RETIRE LIVE LIFE NOT WORRYING ABOUT MONEY!!!  I said eff it and dropped the money numbers on how I've done and told her I paid off my credit card off in 2 weeks!!  Now all of a sudden she's interested, sigh....
I finally gave up trying to convince people that don't want to listen to me.  They'll read about it or hear about it in the news when everyone else does.  I'd much rather spend my time helping new people learn that actually WANT to listen to me, and make a little BTC on the side doing it.

Bitfloor is actually very nice.  I deposited with them three separate times yesterday.

Making peanuts, maybe, but learning along the way, and spreading the message of bitcoin out to the masses.  The guy I met was really into metals, he wasn't a techy kinda guy, he had silver rings and necklaces and a WAD of cash in his pocket, not in a weird way, in a cool jewelry and he doesn't like banks kinda way.  I sat and talked with him about bitcoin, ppcoin, litecoin, silver, gold, all kinds of fun stuff.  I told him next time I meet him to bring his laptop and I'd show him how to encrypt and backup his wallets and shit.
He called me about two hours later just to say thank you, and that next time we meet he'd be willing to pay me +15% market price cuz he knows i have to pay for gas and shit driving back and forth, hustling my "peanuts."  He was super excited to meet someone who could show him how to do cloud backups, take proper security precautions, and make him feel better that if something ever happened to his phone (we just qr'd them from my phone to his), he wouldn't lose all his funds.  He even offered to pay me for that time as well, on top of what i charge him for the bitcoins themselves.
People are hungry for information, they want to learn how to use this.  One of his first question was "are you a forum member or something?"  Most people didn't study CS in college like I had the privilege of doing, they don't know how the hell this shit works, it's fuckin alien voodoo magic to them.  
**People will always fear what they do not understand.**
I told him that I didn't want to be paid, I was happy to teach him, because it's important for people like you and I to do what we can to teach people that don't know so much about how this this whole crazy thing works, and if we can make it easier for them then all of a sudden they aren't so scared of it.  Then people can start looking past all the blah blah of the price and start to realize the *potential* of this.  Then you'll start to see their eyes start to get a little wider, they start to listen a little more intently.  Suddenly you're not talking about some imaginary currency that some hacker made up, but a useful tool that can make their lives easier.  We sat outside talking about how nice it would be if the coffee shop took bitcoin, just a little QR code next to each register or whatever, and we could go in and order some coffee with our 'made up not real money'.  It's hard to say it's not real when you have a cup of coffee in your hand, right?  It's hard to say it's not real when I went to the gas station and put gas in my truck, finally.  It's real to me.
Hopefully my peanuts are golden eggs someday, but for today, I'm happy with them.

The merchant would never see it.  The situation you are describing would never be picked up by the network, it's invalid.  Everyone else can look at their copies of the blockchain and see that you don't have that balance to spend, thus it would not go through.

No, you asked where the value comes from.  It's a simple math problem.  Total volume of money invested / total number of available coins = value for 1 bitcoin.  If suddenly some large party sold lets say 100 million dollars of bitcoins and cashed out, the value would dip down to 60ish, until people bought those coins back again and put the money back in.

Gold was used as a currency for thousands of years, I'm sure I don't have to elaborate on that fact to you.
To answer your question, I would know how much my gold is worth by how much *stuff* I can buy with it.  Gold is particularly interesting to me because historically gold is an excellent judge of *value* over the course of time; or put another way the same amount of gold is said to buy you the same amount of things now as it did in historical times (house, horse, mammoth, whatever).  It is not gold that is ever increasing in value, it is Fiat ever decreasing when ***compared*** to gold, as you are doing.  
I'm glad that you mention gold bugs paying for their groceries in Fiat, it highlights some of the features of Bitcoin that excel over gold.  You are correct, it is impractical to go the gas station and buy milk with gold, the amounts are too small and there is no way of verifying quantities unless you have specialized equipment, especially for such small amounts.  Bitcoin does not suffer from these same restrictions, it is infinitely divisible and easily verifiable to name a few traits.
We don't ***need*** Fiat for anything, there is nothing that says we NEED government to issue our currency, it's just that we've been accustomed to it for so long that it is hard to picture a world where it doesn't exist.  That world is Bitcoin :D

"Ban" - mods telling us what we can or cannot post in our sub. Very big difference between the two.

Why do people assume we're using it like an exchange?  I use it to buy cheap coins when the price dips.  It's really convenient, just go drop money in my bank account on Monday.
Everyone needs to calm down and not worry about how other people buy or sell their coins, to each his own.

because mtgox is the largest and their market dictates the whole market (see crash ha)
It's really dumb, that's why I recommend people stay away from MtGox and as an extension of that, coinbase as well.  Can't beat their withdraw method tho, straight to your bank account and zero fees.  sigh soon we'll have real exchanges...

I told my buddy this the other day, just print out his paper wallet put it in his safe, then just send money to it using the public address whenever he wants.  You'd have to load the paper wallet up into a client to withdraw from it, but you can always deposit to it.  It's like putting money is his safe without ever actually having to open up the safe.

look up '2 of 3' transactions for your fifth bullet point, already built into Bitcoin just currently isn't being utilized.
*bah I just looked it up and there are no hits on google.
Basically, you add a third address to the transaction, a dispute mediator.  2 parties must agree for the money to be sent.
If the buyer/seller agree, they satisfy the 2 of 3 and the money gets sent as planned.
If the buyer is unhappy, he contacts the 3rd party, who will look at the situation.  If he agrees with the buyer, that constitutes the 2 of 3, and the buyer gets his money returned.  If the mediator sides with the seller, then again, that satisfies 2 of 3 and the seller gets the money.
At no point can the mediator take the money.  They can only decide who gets it.
This is already built in, just not utilized yet. (I think I said that already)

I don't see anything in there saying that you can't clean an infected machine and the only recourse is to delete everything at the first sign of something bad.  
Why not just encrypt the wallet, store it in a truecrypt container, and sleep easy?  You say because of keyloggers, but I've never met a keylogger that isn't detected by basic security software (I know I know just because I haven't seen one doesn't mean they don't exist).
I dunno, I might be lax when it comes to security, I was just pointing out that a wipe and reformat over every little infection seems **VERY** extreme to me, and in an environment with anything over 50 employees you're not going to be reinstalling every time someone comes to you with a Symantec pop up.

So I'm in, very nice site.  Is this just a 1 month trial run?  I'm on the membership page and see we've been credited for 1 month of your standard plan.  Will this downgrade to mini upon expiring?  and when it does, do the 3% withdrawal fees apply to outgoing btc transactions or is that a POS fee?
Looks great, just don't wanna deposit btc if in one month you are going to start chipping away at it and me not even realize.
