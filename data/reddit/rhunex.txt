I doubt most people here or those over at (where I first saw this article) understand that "free" checking accounts are, at best, loss leaders for banks. They don't do free checking out of the goodness in their hearts. They do it because accounts with large sums of stagnant money are useful to the bank, you're more likely to do other (profit generating) things with the bank like get a loan, etc.
I understand people have legitimate problems with banks, but the "new" terms BoA is putting out is 100% verbatim what I remember checking to be in the 90s. You either pay a small fee monthly or have a minimum amount in the account at all times. And in return they manage and protect your money. Whether that's worth the cost is up to each individual.

It's not smart to. Transfer funds (wire, ACH) into coinbase and the fees will be 0 and it will happen instantly. But with a credit card you pay 4% and your BTC will "arrive" in about 10 days.

The true hodl. I bought in at 1.7k so it's not hard for me to hodl. BTC will rise again to new ATHs. It'll just take a while.

Everyone here has faith in Bitcoin. But when we say it's going to the moon, there's an implied disclaimer:
1. Maybe it won't, and BTC will drop to $0 some day.
2. It's going to take years to get there. In the meantime we can expect large drops (90% at times) and long periods of nothing happening. You may in fact have more fun dragging your genitals through shards of glass. 
The people who bought at $1200 and had to wait 2 years to be solvent (if such people exist) had to endure a very long time in the red. BTC jumped from $4k to $20k in the matter of two months, and people act like BTC owes them something when it's down here at $14k for a few weeks.
This is it. This is the dream. You buy BTC, you HODL, and you hope that you didn't just lose all your money. You shouldn't be spending money on Bitcoin that you're afraid to lose. And when it drops 33% you take a step back, take a deep breath, and go do something else with your life. Come back in 2 months and things might be better. Or, better yet, come back the next time Bitcoin hits another news cycle and people are jumping up and down about $30k or $40k or $50k.

Wires clear within a business day, but that'll depend more on your bank than anything else. The funds are not available until the wire clears.
ACH can take over a week to clear. The funds will be out of your bank account and there's still time after that when it's not cleared. But the ACH funds are available immediately, up to $500 per day.

I'm assuming you're in the US since you used "$".
1. Moving large amounts of money takes a long time. I've seen wires as small as $18,000 take a week to clear.
2. The IRS is interested in any money transfers larger than $10,000, and even that isn't a hard limit (ie someone transferring $9999.99 a hundred times doesn't fool their system).
3. Bitstamp is based in London. The IRS may be doubly concerned about funds from a foreign entity. This concern isn't abated just because bitstamp has an office in the US.
As others said, exchanges are being overwhelmed right now. So you need to calm down and accept the fact it may take a week or two more to get your funds.

Do you have any insight to the progress of Schnorr signatures? It seems like blogs have been reporting that it's on the to do list for a while.
It would basically solve all current problems simply by having schnorr + segwit. LN would simply be a boost above that.

Also, you have two positions:
1. Not reporting trollish game money. Pay "x" amount of taxes.
2. Report non-zero amount of trollish game money. Pay "x" plus some additional non-zero amount "y". 
For case 2 you'll cause one of several things:
1. They audit you, and decide you need to pay more taxes.
2. They audit you, and decide you get some of "y" refunded.
3. No audit.
In cases 1 or 2, your tax dollars pay the IRS to audit you. In cases 1 and 3 you're paying taxes you really don't need to pay. I'm all for malicious compliance, but the IRS is the last agency you want to troll. No matter what you do, they win. It's your money that ends up paying them to unravel your evil plot.
This is just like little kids who call a pizza restaurant and do a prank call, thinking they're ruining the employees life. In reality the employee still gets paid for the prank call and it's likely an interesting break from a bleak shift.

Totally agree. As someone who is pretty well off, I could order a wire transfer into an exchange from my bank account and have it transferred by the end of the day (assuming weekday).  I could easily transfer 100% of my paycheck (if I wanted to) each pay day and we're talking about 5 minutes of effort, tops with BTC sitting there, already being hodled, by CoB on pay day.
I know OP is excited, and I guess it's great that he's done this, but it's not something I would do since the barrier of USD-&gt;BTC is so low for me. I spend more time on coincap, bitcoinity, etc on a daily basis than it would take to transfer money around.

With segwit and the schnorr signatures (in development) the number of transactions per block would be equal to ~2.6 MB of pre-segwit transactions (this is just from memory, so it may be a different size). The upside is that if schnorr happens soon (early 2018), then anyone who hasn't adopted segwit yet will be able to get both at once.
So those two technologies + lightning network will accomplish quite a bit. It's been estimated that we wouldn't have the current backlog at all if we just had segwit and schnorr. So even lightning network isn't required. It's just that Schnorr doesn't have a delivery date yet, and some major exchanges like coinbase refuse to do segwit.

The federal reserve isn't a national bank nor is it owned by the state. The only monopoly it has is on USD, but other currencies are allowed to be used. You could even pay for things with Euros or Yen, if you found a seller willing to take it.

Someone else stated the news event but it's important to point out that the price only dropped $300 which is only ~5%. They look big because the chart is zoomed in to exaggerate the drop.
We see 5% rises just as frequently if not more than the 5% drops (over long periods of time).
Just another day in crypto trading.

Well for one, most alts get their fiat value via their BTC trading pair.
Also if there is profit to be made by trading BTC-&gt;Shitcoin-&gt; Shitcoin-&gt;Shitcoin-&gt;BTC then bots will figure it out. Even if this profitability is spread across multiple exchanges (which then includes arbitrage).

Forks are just Bitcoin's way of paying you dividends for being a long time hodler. Sell the shitcoin and reinvest your "dividends" back into Bitcoin. Or you can share the love with your favorite alt coins too.

You're misunderstanding what they said:


Meaning there will eventually be a year where something like a 10x return isn't remotely feasible. When Bitcoin reaches equilibrium it will continue to grow in price per BTC, but that increase will match the same increase as the inflation of USD and other currencies that interact heavily with BTC.

Wire transfers are good (and quick, less than 1 business day for me). But you can expect your bank to have daily/weekly limits of its own. Eg mine had a daily limit of $5,000 and monthly limit of $15,000. And it comes with a flat $30 fee per transfer.
So if you do a $5000 chunk all at once, that'll cost you ~0.6% of what you're transferring, which isn't bad at all. If you're doing $500 chunks just go with the ACH option. Gemini let's you use it immediately anyways.
