They have no trading background and come from the geeky tech side. Very dangerous for they know something about the possibilities of the technique but nothing about trading. This and dumb customer FOMO not only creates the current bubble, but will make it rise to 3-4k this year. I don't expect a real retracement until then. Every dip is being bought. I use Bitcoin as a hedge. I buy them leveraged and sell them every 500 rise to invest in commodities. Maybe I'll keep some till 4k this time. It will crash  when big money causes out and causes panic selling. Panic selling by the same euphoric redditors who cry at every 100 rise. Sure, if gold would rise 100 in a day I would be euphoric too and instantly close positions. This doesn't happen with Bitcoin. Parabolic for now. The big correction? It might never happen.

Investopedia.com But it takes at least a year to learn the basics. You'll make mistakes but that's ok! See it as money you'd otherwise pay for an education. That's what I did after suffering losses. Read a bit about moving averages, MACD, Fibonacci retracements, volume, there's a lot to learn. Pyramiding is done in every market, and I bet most here would say it's a given for btc. I hold no real btc though, I only go long and short with contracts

800 is actually more likely than my optimistic 1300. I love shorting just as much as I like buying so no prob.

1300 and we're about to exit the bulltrap.

Lol we've got a millionaire here. What's some student loans to a millionaire? Some tips: gold and silver started their reversal. Aim for 17.5/18.6 silver and 1300 gold. Go long on WTI after it breaches 48.6 resistance. Use Fibonacci retracements for reference.

Still, only a few are millionaires. Maybe more in the US because of the gap between rich and poor and higher dollar loans compared to the euro. I only know one millionaire. Most people have around 5-50k euro in savings and a lot no savings at all. I always read here about people easily having 200k in savings in the US while the news speaks about huge debts and unemployment

Wait for clear confirmation of a trend reversal. 800 based on previous corrections afaik. Patterns, patterns, patterns.
