Your wallet might generate a new address after everyone transaction. You might be checking a newly generated address, instead of the one used in your transaction.

Blockchain.info has had so many issues in the past. It's also no longer listed on bitcoin.org as recommended wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:17:12
There are no 'business practice' laws protecting your bitcoin. It's your own full responsibility. Also, it would be clearer if you call them Blockchain.info. 'Blockchain' is a very general term.

Yes, that happens when your wallet software generates a new address for the change. This address is then only present on the computer/phone the paper wallet was imported on. People would then delete the wallet software, destroying the private key for the change address (they partially spend from the paper wallet, thinking the remainder would still be on the paper wallet). Newer wallets might have become smarter, having a 'spend from paper wallet' option which doesn't generate a new change address, but use the old paper wallet address. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:57:39
Alright, I tried answering it in your other thread.

@_date: 2018-01-19 11:47:18
What is bizarre? It just used the original paper wallet as change address. If you didn't want this to happen you should have spend the full amount of the paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:38:01
It only has 2 outputs, the second output is most likely change.

Setting a custom miner fee was already possible, the update just changed the UI to make it more user friendly.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:49:01
Why did you hit send if you saw fees would be about 86% of your transaction?  You could've first moved it to GDAX, and then withdraw from there for free. GDAX pays the fee for you (although I'm not sure if they pay it if you transfer such small amounts).

That's weird. That link is not an accelerator, but just way to push your tx to the network. Also, when you copy the raw tx, it's not the tx hash (txid), but the actual transaction in hexadecimal. Other websites to push a tx:
You can also use the console in Bitcoin Core (with the sendrawtransaction command), but Core will probably already rebroadcast transactions automatically.

@_date: 2018-01-20 20:57:55
Alright, I'm sorry. Do you mean Coinbase or GDAX? Because GDAX pays the fee for you, where at Coinbase you have to it yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:28:43
The paper wallet was used as change address. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:02:44
Perhaps there is a minimum amount where GDAX pays the fee for you.

Never use Blockchain.info wallet. Why would you send another ~$800 after $200 was stolen from you?

At buy.bitcoin.com, what did you enter at 'Bitcoin address'? You're supposed to put an address you have control over.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:42:36
Blockchain.info is not a recommended wallet to use.

You can set your own fee with Samourai. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:09:41
Copy the raw transaction (right click the transaction). Then paste it here:  and click Submit Transaction. But nodes might drop your transaction because the fee is way too low.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:57:35
You can give people a (newly generated) address from your wallet. All previously generated addresses stay valid forever, so it's safe to receive funds to them.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:38:37
You somehow imported the address in Mycelium. Because this address is not part of seed, the wallet probably didn't use a change address generates from the seed. I don't use Mycelium, so I don't know how it works exactly. It's also possible that you had to create a new wallet, and import the private key there. Because the new wallet is not based on a seed (it only has one address) it cannot create any change addresses, so it uses the original address. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:43:47


That doesn't sound good.

This is what they're doing: 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:50:46
You never enter private keys anywhere (they are private). You enter your (public) bitcoin address on Coinbase to move coins from your Coinbase to your Ledger. When you want to move them back to Coinbase, you create a transaction on your Ledger with the bitcoin address that Coinbase gives you as destination address. You never have to handle or deal with Private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:08:07
The input refers to a transaction ID which I cannot find. This is the error I get when trying to push your transaction:


Seems like your tx is invalid, or I'm doing something wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:12:32
Mis-typing an address will result in an invalid address, which won't be accepted by any wallet. You'll simply get an error. You won't lose any money.

15.1 is already released. Segwit wallet support was moved to 0.16... I'm sorry!
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:32:32
All private keys on the device are derived from the seed, which you need to write down. So by knowing the seed, you know every private key the device will generate.
Edit: Seems like this hardware device does not work with writing down a seed on paper, but it's saved on a SD card. I don't really see the advantage over paper though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:43:17
The device generates the seed internally.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:54:20
Sorry, I don't know much about those. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:06:21


Why would you do this? Have the BTC send to wallet you control, don't buy private keys... It's too easy to keep a copy and move the coins later.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:20:44
Which wallet?

Yes, you would be safe! Because you're only person to know your private key (all private keys on your Ledger are derived from the seed you wrote down).

I would remove this piece of text completely from here. I never know how much is showing to be able to reconstruct private keys with bruteforcing.

Transactions on exchanges are always off chain. They're not recorded on the blockchain.

Yes, this can happen in any way private keys are traded. Don't trade private keys. Use a Bitcoin transaction to move value between buyer and seller.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:06:14
No, because you have to seed to recover the funds.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:34:31
The fee depends on the size of the transaction (in bytes). More inputs/outputs result in a higher transaction size.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:16:09
Yes, you can copy the Bitcoin software. Without changing anything (like a perfect copy), it will actually follow the current Bitcoin Blockchain and work together with all the other nodes in the Bitcoin network. If you change some values within the software, your copy of Bitcoin will have **different properties** and is no longer Bitcoin. Same with gold. 'Gold' with different properties than gold is no longer gold, but another element.

That really depends on where you buy them. Most exchanges will first hold the bitcoin for you, and you have to manually withdraw. But I've also seen websites where you can enter a bitcoin address, and they send the BTC directly to that address. If you meet someone in person, you can of course have them send it directly to your wallet.

The block reward started with 50 BTC per block. The fun thing is, if you keep summing the different block rewards (50+25+12.5+6.25+...) you will eventually get (nearly) 100. The halving of the block reward happens every 210,000 blocks. If you multiply 210,000 by 100 you get the total amount of bitcoins that will ever be created (21 million).
  Satoshi had probably the following numbers in mind:
- 100 as 'total' block reward (as explained above).
- 10 minutes per block.
- 4 years for each halving.  
1 block per 10 minutes is 210,240 blocks per 4 years (6* 24* 365* 4), which if rounded nicely is 210,000.

Really? 250 bits :)
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:32:45
This is not recommended with Bitcoin Core, because it's not a hierarchical deterministic wallet. This means if one of the wallet generates new private keys (for change addresses for example), the other wallet wouldn't know of these private keys and the wallets wouldn't synchronize anymore. 
  If you import a private key from a wallet, it will exist in both the original wallet and the new wallet. Be careful with this and know what you are doing. Sweeping a private key is often a better option.

On coinbase.com you can buy bitcoin by linking a bank account or credit card. I don't know if this is possible if you're 16. It also really depends on where you live.

Bitcoin is getting 'famous' because it's an easy and cheap way to send money. 
  There's no such thing as 'free money'. Miners who mine for profit invest a lot in hardware and pay a lot for electricity.

This is not possible for Blockchain.info, because they don't hold any of your private keys (and thus can't do off chain transactions). People would never use companies like Coinbase only, because that would undermine the whole idea of Bitcoin and would kind of create a single point of failure.

   What is the definition of 1 dollar? We all know the supply of dollars is not very stable and the dollar has lost a lot of value over the years. Gold has been the way to measure value for thousands of years. Gold priced in fiat looks volatile, but over long periods of time it's gold that keeps the same purchasing power (thus keeping its actual value.)
   If Bitcoin would ever replace the dollar, we could price a bitcoin in gold. And if Bitcoin became less volatile, it wouldn't need a to be priced in anything, Bitcoin would become the way to measure other things.

Miners will still get the block reward (until 2140 at least). 
  And if mining isn't profitable anymore, some miners will drop out, resulting in the difficulty to get lowered, making mining profitable again for the other miners.
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:30:15
Yes, this is because you are referring in the transaction to previous transactions (these small payments) and not addresses.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:43:30
Really depends on where you live. Here in The Netherlands I can buy bitcoin really easy at bitonic.nl. They are immediately send to a bitcoin address that I control (within 3 minutes). No credit card is needed, only a debit card. Purchases are limited to €10,000.

No, nothing is going on. It's possible that it takes 45 minutes to find a new block.

No, there's 100% chance of this being a scam and 0% that it's not. Proofing you are really the owner of an address can be done by signing a message with that addresss. Sending 0.1 BTC is not necessary.
  And why do you think this 0.1 are the transaction costs? They just want you to send them a lot of money... Transactions fees are usualy 0.1 mBTC (0.0001 BTC) which is about $0.03. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 21:44:57
You probably don't have to worry. Wallets usually keep the private key hidden. Public keys (or actually the addresses) start with a '1' and are about 33 characters long.

They probably don't verify 8 years of transactions (~200 milion) on the Raspberry Pi, but already had downloaded the blockchain on a faster computer. You'll probably be done in a few days. Once you're finished, you never have to do the initial sync again.
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:45:21
Bitcoin Core (previously called Bitcoin-Qt) downloads the whole blockchain, which is currently like 120 GB. And it verifies all transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:59:41
Wallets which do not store the whole blockchain have to ask other nodes for balance information etc. If you have the whole blockchain, your wallet can check balances itself. This increases privacy a ~~little bit~~ lot.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:15:43
I'm assuming you're using Blockchain.info. If you go to settings&gt;Addresses&gt;Import Address, you can import your cold storage address as Watch Only. Now if you want to spend from your paper wallet, click More Options (next to the Watch Only address)&gt;Advanced Send. Enter the private key. I recommend to always spend the whole amount at once and to never use this paper wallet again (it's no longer 'cold'). Click the '+' to set multiple outputs. An example:
Your paper wallet holds 1 BTC. You want to send 0.7 BTC to a friend and the remaining (~0.3 BTC) to a NEW paper wallet. Enter your friends address into the 'To:' field. Click the '+'. Enter your new paper wallet address in this field. Set an appropriate fee, lets say 0.001 BTC. Enter 0.7 BTC for your friend and 0.299 BTC for your new paper wallet. Click Next Step. Now you should be able to execute the transaction. (I can't test this last step because I don't wanna spend from a paper wallet now).
I hope this helps! Now, what I described is not sweeping, but importing, which saves you 1 transaction and thus fees and time.

You can check it for yourself here: 


For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 40,680 satoshis.
0.00040680 BTC × 1200 USD/BTC = 0.48816 USD = 49 cents.

The network does not see the difference between sweeping and a 'normal transaction'. Both are a transaction, so both require a fee. Now with sweeping, you're sending to yourself, so it may be fine to pay a lower fee and just wait a little longer.

If you're gonna sell or move your BTC to an exchange, importing is fine, if you're gonna leave your BTC in your mobile wallet for a longer time, or someone else has access to your paper wallet, sweeping is better. If your wallet uses a list of words as backup (the seed), an imported private key is NOT covered by this seed, so be careful with this.
The fee when sweeping depends on the wallet you're using. I would expect you can set the fee yourself. Look for an 'advanced' setting or something.
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:40:53
Good question, I don't really know the answer. I'm guessing a simple home printer/scanner usually doesn't store files. Just don't print at work/school at these big printers with much more functionality. Also, you might consider to not sell your printer. 
Another good thing to do is to encrypt the private key with BIP38. Then you need both the encrypted private key (printed), and the passphrase (in your head, or written downby hand) in order to access the bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:03:41
Yeah, that's correct. The average transaction size is 519.57 bytes according to [tradeblock.com](
With 180 satoshi/byte, this would give a transaction fee of 1.12 USD.
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:09:33
If the price would be exactly 0 on exchanges, it would mean people would give bitcoins away for free...  Why would people do that when there's still the possibility that the price would go up?

Brain wallets are not considered safe, because humans are bad at creating safe (strong) passphrases.
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:46:06
What's the point then when a random private key only has like 52 characters? Just encrypt the private key with BIP38. Brain wallets can be bruteforced from anywhere, to bruteforce a BIP38 encrypted private key, you would first need to get your hands on the encrypted key. Also, BIP38 takes much longer to brutefore.

You have hotkeys for all of these, right? ;)
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:30:59
No, there's a difference, although some people call sweeping importing. With sweeping, you move the BTC from the paper wallet to the hot wallet. With importing, you just copy the private key to the hot wallet.
In both cases, I don't reuse the paper wallet.

I checked the transaction again. I see 1 transaction. One output is about $98.90 (0.0829504 BTC) and another output is about $106.95 (0.0897027 BTC). Did you make this transaction yourself? You said $100 was taken. Are you sure this isn't just change that went back to your wallet?

Yes, using a new address every time improves security and privacy. 
You spent from addresses that previously received coins. So spending from 'another' address is not possible. You can receive multiple payments on one address, even as your HD wallet doesn't show this address anymore (its private key is still in your wallet).

This is correct. Some wallets also give you the option to subtract the fee from the amount. For example you want to send  exactly 1 BTC, including fee. Let's say the fee is 0.0001 BTC. The recipient then gets 0.9999 BTC. There are instances when this is more practical then adding the fee to the amount. For example when you want to empty your wallet.

You are correct at that the 50 BTC from the genesis block cannot be spend, but signing a message with the private key that belongs to the address it was sent to is still possible. This address is 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa which now holds about 65 BTC. Satoshi can still spend this 15 BTC that was sent to the address over the years.

At  you can compare a lot of wallets. I personally use Bitcoin Core as desktop wallet, Schildbach Bitcoin Wallet as mobile wallet. I would also recommend a hardware wallet. Note that Bitcoin Core downloads the whole blockchain (~120 GB) and takes time to synchronize, so it's less user friendly than other wallets. I would stay clear of web wallets. 
This is just my opinion. Please educate yourself and find out what wallet is best for you!

Confirmations have nothing to do with the amount of nodes or miners. When your transaction is included in a block, that's your first confirmation. Every block that builds on top of this block, counts as another confirmation. Blocks are found on average every 10 minutes (can be shorter, can be longer). 
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:55:52
Wait, how are you gonna check if your wrote down everything correctly? The private key is needed to spend the coins. We don't know if you wrote those down correctly. It's better to just click 'Print' on the web page (if you have a printer).
  But actually, please do a little more research before sending money to a paper wallet. You need to be sure you know how to use the private key in order to spend from a paper wallet, and be sure what 'change' is.
  And if you wanna be more anonymous, I wouldn't use these 2 addresses anymore for cold storage, we now know you (Litter_hosely) controls these addresses and we could track your bitcoins in the future. If this is a throwaway account, then I think it's okay though.

The 0.00256202 BTC went back to your wallet (to a new address) as change. 
See it as paying with a $20 bill for a $15 purchase. The extra $5 you hand over is still part of the transaction, but goes immediately back in your wallet when the cashier gives you your change.

Currently, Bitcoin only has 8 decimal places, the smallest unit is a satoshi (0.00000001 BTC). The block reward is rounded down to the nearest satoshi. Eventually, the block reward will be 1 satoshi and will then be rounded to 0 in the next halving. If we decide to increase the amount of decimal places, halving could go on longer. In theory even forever, if we keep adding decimal places.

Only read your TL;DR.
A wallet is a collection of private keys with asociated addresses. For improved security and privacy, it is adviced to use a new address for every transaction, especially when you spend from an address, because that reveals the public key.
I'll give a  small explanation why you don't want to reuse an adress which has its public key revealed in a previous transaction. The public key is derived from the private key and the address is derived from the public key:
    private key ---1---&gt; public key ---2---&gt; address
Process 1 and 2 are irreversible, however, process 1 would in theory be easier to break with a quantum computer. If an attacker knows the private key, the person can steal all the funds asociated with that address.

No, because the hash of the previous block is also input for the hash. This links all blocks in the blockchain. Miners build upon the longest chain. If your block has the previous block hash of a very old block, nobody's gonna build on your block (aka use your hash as input in their block).

Yes, if your wallet is really Bitcoin-QT. 


This won't work, it would still be encrypted, but making a backup of the wallet.dat file is always a good idea. It's located in the folder where Bitcoin-QT is installed.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:43:25
No, that would only have worked pre-fork. If you have your bitcoin on a private key from before the fork, you could manually split your BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:33:54


If you don't wanna hold bitcoin you shouldn't buy bitcoin. If the price starts dropping and you decide to sell, you can still send your funds from your wallet (like a Trezor) to an exchange and sell them.

Because the actual average time is more like 8 or 9 minutes (because of increasing mining capacity), and if this would continue, it will be earlier than 2140, but not by a 100 years. 8 minutes blocks would be like 2120.

If you literally follow the User Agreement, you have to ask support for approval to send coins to a different exchange. You could do that and say GDAX doesn't work for you.
You could also send the coins to a different wallet first and hope they don't track you that far.
Or you could just send the coins to an exchange anyway and if they close your account for whatever stupid reason then let it be. You probably wouldn't wanna use Coinbase again anyway.

"Empty blocks" still always contain the coinbase transaction. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:33:16
Normally, blocks are found roughly every 10 minutes. Because there are less miners on the new chain, it takes longer to find a block. It's speculated that they stopped mining temporarily, to let the difficulty readjust automatically to a lower difficulty.

First move your BTC from your old wallet to a new wallet, then import the old wallet to a BCH wallet (for example Electron Cash). You now have splitted your BTC/BCH. But be careful, many BCH wallets have not been tested much. Also, it's not very easy to send BCH to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:38:10

I don't use MultiBit myself, but I looked it up. MultiBit does not support Replace-by-fee (RBF) transactions, where you would rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee. That's unfortunate. If the fee is below the minimal fee, I think nodes and miners will start the drop the tx from their tx pool eventually. It may be necessary to rescan the blockchain, so MultiBit will show the correct balance again. The option 'Reset block chain and transactions' should do this. Source: [MultiBit Support](
Edit: An hour is not really long, especially when blocks are completely full. I would start by waiting a little longer.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:36:24
Even if Coinbase decides to keep the BCH for themselves, that's the risk of trusting a third party with your cryptocurrency. Never leave money on an exchange.

It can make a difference, especially for really weak hands. If the price starts going down some people will panic and sell immediately. If they first have to wait for 6 confirmations, the price may already have recovered and they no longer wanna sell.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:13:24
I know, you're correct. My point was that the block reward transaction (the coinbase) counts as a transaction and takes up space in a block, next to the block header. I think the smallest block possible is around 215 bytes (the header is 80 bytes).
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:55:21
Yes, I know. But for a regular user it will look like more transactions fit in a block. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:27:17
Yes, you can still get it. You can send and receive with your current BTC wallet, without affecting your BCH. Just keep your pre-fork private keys safe, they give acces to your BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:53:25


They can import it to any wallet and spend your bitcoin that is asociated with that private key. That's why it is important to keep private keys private.

The blockchain does not know about any private keys. Only addresses, which are mathematicaly derived from the private key. You can send bitcoin to any valid address, Bitcoin does not care if the private key for that address is actually known.

I think this is not possible, the block would be rejected. The miner has to claim the full block reward (12.5 BTC currently), but it can choose to not claim the transaction fees. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:32:16
Bitcoin is not really suitable for such small amounts at the moment. Also, nobody's forcing you to pay such a high fee. You can set your own fee. Blocks are full at the moment, it's possible that during the weekend it will be less busy. SegWit is activated next week, which will increase the block size a little and make secondary layers such as the Lightning network possible. Hopefully this will allow for more transactions and lower fees.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:57:46

You can use the ~~public key~~ address to check the balance. 


You could import the private key to an offline computer and sign the transaction. Then move the signed transaction to an online computer and send it to the network. But it would still be better to not use that paper wallet again.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:27:14
The transactions miners choose to include in their block are also part of the input for the hash. Changing one transaction changes the hash. You want to broadcast your block as soon as possible, because another miner could find a valid block soon after.


Basically, the hash must be below a certain value. The hash is a 256 bit integer, and the difficulty determines what the maximum value of this number can be for a valid block.

From the [Bitcoin Wiki]( (I think this is a good explanation):










This means miners can add transactions during mining and start working on a 'new' block. It does not reset any chance to find a block. At any time the chance to find a block is the same (with constant hashing power).

* Privacy (variable, basic, improved)

Because nobody is really using them that much. If we all would switch, these altcoins would run into the same 'problems' as Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is always being improved. We now have Segwit, which makes more transactions per block possible. Segwit is still not used by everyone, so there's still room for improvement here. Segwit also makes second layer solutions like the Lightning Network possible. You should look it up.
Other improvements, like ways to make signatures smaller is also being worked on ([Schnorr signatures](

There was never code to allow 'doubling of the block size'. In the beginning of Bitcoin, there was no blocksize limit. In 2010, the limit was set to 1MB per block. It didn't cause a fork, because all blocks were less than 1MB anyway.

It depends on where you live, but yes, Coinbase is quite easy to use. They are like a broker, they buy the BTC for you. And they take a percentage in the process.

If you've already split your BTC/BCH, then yes, you can just send your BCH to an exchange and sell it. But if your BTC and BCH are still at the same address, you have to import your private keys to a BCH wallet. It's highly recommended to first send your BTC to a new wallet. In this way, you're not trusting the BCH wallet with your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:33:20
No, it doesn't make a difference. Multiple transactions to the same address still create multiple unspent outputs which are later used as inputs for a new transaction.

Importing private keys does not involve a transaction, so there is no fee. Blockchain.info most likely wants to sweep the balance to a new private key, which needs a transaction and has a fee.

Because that's the whole idea of a wallet. The wallet manages your collection of private keys. Most wallets create a new address for every transaction, to improve privacy.
In a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet, the private keys are derived from the seed (12 or 24 words). This means all your private keys in your wallet can be recovered from the seed.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:29:51
Nice, makes me remember about clicking these faucets for free satoshis a couple of years ago. You could also watch some ads in exchange for a small amount of BTC. After doing that a couple of months, it was maybe worth 5 euro. I just checked, it's now 200 euro. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:00:21
It doesn't work like that, Bitcoin Core (Qt) connects to many other nodes on the network, and downloads the blockchain from many computers at the same time (like a torrent). The limiting factor will most likely be the CPU that has checks the validity of every block and transaction. Or the limiting factor is bandwith.

Yes, control over your private keys equals access to your Bitcoin. But the point of a paper wallet is having the private key offline, not on any online device. If you import the private key to a device connected to the internet, the paper wallet is no longer 'cold'.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:10:14
Okay, I see what you mean now. This makes it a little more complicated I think. I don't know how to export the 100 addresses. You could try running your Bitcoin Core in pruned mode. It will synchronize with the network, but not store everything on the disk. Perhaps [this]( post helps.

You don't 'receive' anything. It's just that your private keys in your Bitcoin Core wallet will give access to both your BTC and Forkcoin of the same amount after the fork. Standard procedure (if the fork has replay protection) is then to move all your BTC to a new wallet, and then import your old private keys (which still hold the Forkcoin) into a wallet which supports the Forkcoin.

Bitcoin-QT/Bitcoin Core doesn't have the option to create 'accounts' like this. I've never seen .acct and .priv files. You probably used a different wallet/software. It's still possible those files contain private keys, but you need to know what software you used. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:10:25


What is this? And what is wrong with bitcoin.org or GitHUB to update your software?
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:34:31
This is very contradicting, because to check a balance, you need a synced blockchain, and for that you require an internet connection, while cold storage requires absence of an internet connection. 
If you install Bitcoin Core on an offline computer, then send funds to it, then copy a copy of the blockchain to it, it will probably show the balance. But the blockchain will be out of sync, so you never know for sure if the balance is up to date and accurate. If for some reason your bitcoin get stolen, your offline out of sync wallet will happily show you the old non zero balance. I cannot imagine you want this. You could copy an updated copy blockchain to it every day or week, but that seems like a lot of work...
What i recommend is to set up Electrum on an offline computer. Then export the master public address, and import it to Electrum on an online computer. Transactions can be created on the online computer, then signed on the offline computer, and then broadcasted on the online computer again. Using a USB drive to move the transaction between computers. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:16:16
0.0012 what per byte? Check your units. The site says 120 satoshi/byte is recommended by them. You're trying to send 0.007 BTC, which is 700,000 satoshi. If your transaction is for example 300 bytes, that's a fee of 120 satoshi/byte * 300 byte = 36,000 satoshi.

Install a wallet where you control the private keys: ** (look for a wallet with 'Control over your money')


The private keys that give you acces to your bitcoin will after a fork also give acces to any fork coins. A wallet might show this explicitly in the interface, or you might have to import the private keys to another wallet.

Mining currently also creates new coins. There will be a maximum of 21 million BTC, but currently there is only around 16 million in circulation. The miner that finds a valid block, rewards himself with 12.5 BTC by adding this as a transaction in his block which has no inputs, thus  creating new bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:54:10


That's because if you create a new address, they don't automatically have a balance. That would be very weird, wouldn't it? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:19:26
The miner includes the coinbase transaction in the block himself. So they basically give the reward to themselves. Yes, if a block gets orphaned, it's no longer part of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:52:08
Bitcoin doesn't work with accounts. Just wallets, which are a collection of 1 or more private keys. To create a transaction, you need software (a Bitcoin wallet) to create the transaction and sign it with the private key. You can find many wallets here:

@_date: 2017-10-23 15:28:38
To be a little more correct, the block reward of a block is the first transaction in that block (with only having an output, no inputs, thus creating new coins). This is called the coinbase transaction. This unspent output can only be spent after 100 confirmations. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:10:32
Yes, all private keys on your device are derived from the 24 (20?) words (recovery seed). In case you loose your device, you can restore you wallet on a new device or in another wallet which supports the same seed format.

@_date: 2017-10-30 15:07:24
Do some research on different wallets, you can start here: 
Once you are familiar with local wallets, recovery seeds and how transactions work, you can start looking into paper wallets. But know that a hardware wallet is most of the time more secure than a paper wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-21 16:02:49
Depends on the wallet. If the wallet is open source, you can just check the code and see if it works as it should.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:47:40


That happens when you import the private keys into a wallet. That's not the same as sweeping. Sweeping would move all BTC to a new address.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:08:01
You can just move them to a new wallet. Also, software can't just 'close down' if it runs locally on your computer or phone.
I would advice against using Blockchain.info. There are better wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:18:39
The private keys ('your keys') are derived from the 12 words. This means you only need to backup the 12 words. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:25:37
Remember that the hash of the previous block is also input of the hash function for the new block. This creates the chain. If 2 blocks are found at the same time (or close to each other) with the same previous block hash, miners might build upon these different blocks. The next block then decides which chain of blocks is the right one. The other block then gets orphaned. The block reward can only be spent after 100 confirmations. So the block reward of the orphaned block has never been in circulation, creating no problems there. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:25:26
Then you could try reinstalling the software, and copying the files to the data folder. But know that Bitcoin Core download the whole blockchain, which is about 150 GB.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:23:47
From the master public key, all addresses are derived that correspond to the private keys generated from the seed on the offline computer.
Edit: check this guide: 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:12:27
You should first do some own research.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:31:19
I don't often use Electrum, but I can answer some of the questions. Addresses in your wallet stay valid forever. You could reuse them if you want. 
The ~~request~~ Receive tab generates not only a new address, but also QR code with build in Description and Requested amount. If someone scans this QR code, the amount and descriptions fields will be automatically be filled in. I don't really know what 'Request Expires' means. It will probably show the scanner of the QR code that the request is expired (but in theory it would be still possible to send BTC to that address.)

Bitcoin Core? It's not the most user friendly. It's possible to use it as a wallet, but you really should do a lot of research and know what you're doing. If you're totally new, I would choose a wallet like Electrum (PC) or Breadwallet (phone).

If 0.007 BTC would cost $700, that would mean a price of $100,000 USD/BTC. That has never been the case in the past.


$400 would currently get you about 0.065 BTC.


$400 in BTC gets you $400 worth in goods. If for example the price of bitcoin doubles between buying BTC and buying goods, the $400 put in BTC initially would suddenly be worth $800.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:56:25

It actually never left your wallet in the first place. Your wallet just assumes the transaction will confirm and already shows the amount subtracted.

Divide your BTC over multiple paper wallets (different private keys) and swipe the whole balance of one private key when you need a small amount of money.

Coinbase is not a wallet, but an account.


No, if Coinbase wants to disclose full names with transactions, they can do that...

In case you lose access to your wallet or blockchain.info goes down, you can restore your wallet with the seed (the 12 words), but imported addresses are not covered by the seed. So you would have to backup these manually. If you only want to backup the seed, move all funds to addresses that are created in 'My Wallet'.

That's not going to work. In the 3rd step, you move BTC coins to a new address, only known in the BTC blockchain. If you then would repeat the step, you would import addresses that have a zero balance on the BCC chain. It only works the first time, because then the addresses have balance before the split and thus a non-zero balance on the BCC chain.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:22:42
Only spending from that address (using one or more of its unspent outputs for the input of a transaction) makes the address a little more vulnerable.

Once you are in bitcoin, it's super easy and fast. Getting into bitcoin can be hard, but it's often the FIAT side that causes the problems.

Sweeping a paper wallet means you send the whole amount to a new address, for example a wallet on your computer or phone. 
Another option is to import the private key of the paper wallet to a wallet on your phone or computer. But this is not really recommended, because this address is then not covered by the seed the wallet uses. Also, the paper wallet still gives access to the bitcoin associated with it, making it vulnerable for theft.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:16:14
What I know for sure is that a virus cannot read my piece of paper. Also, all hardware wallets recommended writing down the seed. I'm not the only one.  
And how are you gonna take a screenshot of a hardware wallet? Maybe you are really good with VMs, but you cannot expect everyone to be that good with computers. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:51:26
This, plus coin control (to be able to select which outputs to use in a transaction), and the ability to sweep paper wallets. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:00:54
I don't recommend this. The seed created by a hardware wallet should never be digitized. That defeats a part of the purpose of hardware wallet. Just write down the seed with pen and paper. If the seed is encrypted with a password, the password can also be written down and stored in a different location.

When you create a private key offline, you basically pick a random number between 0 and 2^(256) (a huge number!). For example: 
This number is then converted to a string that is more easily to read:
And is basically known as the private key.
From the private key, the public key is calculated. The Bitcoin address is the hash of the public key:

At this moment, $20 is approximately worth 0.00709 BTC or 7.09 mBTC.

The Wallet Details tab on [bitaddress.org]( shows the private key in Hexadecimal Format (64 characters [0-9A-F]). This can be easily converted to binary.

You don't control the Bitcoin in your Coinbase account. Coinbase does, and they decide when they want to execute the transaction. Coinbase simply hasn't executed the transaction yet, you'll have to wait. 
Normally, when you make a transaction from a wallet you control, the receiving wallet (your Trezor for example) will immediately see the transaction.

It's done with a hashing algorithm (SHA-256), which is basically a mathematical equation that's really hard to do the other way around. A simple example can be given with prime numbers. Take the prime numbers 23 and 31 (our private keys), you can easily calculate the product (713, our address). But if I give you the number 713, it's hard to split it up in prime numbers. Now, SHA-256 is of course different and way harder, but the concept is the same.

No, the string on this piece of paper is not a private key, but an encrypted private key. You need the passphrase to unencrypt it.


When you created the  paper wallet, you chose to encrypt it with a passphrase. No, the private key is not the passphrase.


It can be anything.


You could try it I guess, if it was a simple passphrase.


That's because Bitcoin Core handles all your private keys for you. They are all in the wallet.dat file. This file is encrypted with your password.


There's no reason for Bitcoin Core to show your private keys. But there are ways to show them. It's just not recommended.

Yes, bitcoins are divisible up to 8 decimal places, so there are 100,000,000 pieces in a bitcoin. One piece is called a satoshi. One thousandth of a bitcoin is called a millibitcoin (mBTC), 1 millionth of a bitcoin is a microbitcoin (μBTC).
One mBTC is currently about $2.68.

No it's not totallly different. It's just easy now to express the value of BTC in a fiat currency. Same for gold, it's easy to price it in a fiat currency, but gold is much older than fiat. Goods and services were priced in gold in the past. We could price stuff in BTC (yes it would fluctuate a lot, because BTC is still small). The market would find a fair price for goods based on supply, demand, and maybe wages (which would also be in BTC).

What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?

More sellers than buyers.

It's a good thing nobody's forcing you to use Bitcoin I guess.

You need specialized harware (ASICs) to mine bitcoin.

Sure, but what if the there was a substantial reward? Rewarding nodes is just not possible in the current system, and I don't see how it could be changed.


I think wallets should protect users from doing such things by accident. I don't think this should be regulated on a protocol level. Because if the price would drop a lot, a 'big' fee could be completely normal. Remember that the Bitcoin protocol does not know the price of one bitcoin.

Compare it to a cash transaction. If you wanna pay someone $50, you could give a $50 dollar bill, making it a 'small' transaction (in size) or you could give 50 $1 bills, making it quite a 'big' transaction. Using pennies would be even larger. Bitcoin works kind of the same. The input of a transaction can consist of multiple unspent outputs.

Just shaking out the weak hands.

About 0. You need specialized hardware to mine bitcoin these days. GPUs can't do it anymore. You might wanna look into mining other crypto currencies.

The flat fee is irrelevant, it's the BTC/kB (or satoshi/byte) that counts. If we don't know how large the transaction is (in bytes), 0.003BTC does not say much. Do you have the transaction ID?
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:00:02
No, just use something else than trezor.io, like Electrum.

The fee is really low, only 16 satoshi/byte while 420 satoshi/byte is needed to get in the next block. There are so many addresses, because the sender used many unspent outputs to create this transaction. Compare it to paying someone $50 in small coins only; this makes it a very 'large' transaction.

Because blockchain.info is an online wallet, you can't 'download' it...
Read about different wallets here:

If the blockchain explorer can't find the address in the blockchain you searched for, it will just simply return 0 BTC.

1 EUR = 1.1151 USD  (at this moment of writing)

Choose one from under 'International' or 'Canada'.

Why not directly buy BTC on Bitstamp?
