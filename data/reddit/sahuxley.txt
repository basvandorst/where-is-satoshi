Ad hominem much?

Other cable lines are not the only alternatives.

"How do you keep it?  Since it's virtual, an online wallet is the only way."

This sort of shows why I have faith that if the government doesn't solve this net neutrality problem, then technology companies will.  The more ISPs try to squeeze profit out of their pipelines, the more incentive we'll have to route around them.

To be fair, bitcoin isn't JUST for online payments like paypal is.

But the ability for them to challenge the charge is exactly why people prefer this over bitcoin.  I'm sorry you got screwed over, but a lot of times it's the people who use those cards getting fraudulent charges.

"Suprising" is subjective.

Each of those companies of course gained their popularity while net neutrality existed.

Right, I was thinking of the transaction as between the customer and the merchant in person at the register, but you're right the payment doesn't happen without the internet involved.  I'm still wrapping my brain around how the whole thing works.

Steam should do something like this; Let users mine for store credit.  It's customers have some bad ass computers.

We aren't just fine with credit cards, we prefer them.  Credit card companies work very very hard to protect their carriers from fraud, and the reversible nature of the transaction is essential when dealing with strangers online.

I usually reply with something like, "Oh you mean like they regulate sharing movies and songs?"

In the US, our legal system is not designed to be 100% fair.  It's designed to err on the side of letting a guilty man walk free rather than an innocent man be convicted.  That burden was placed on the prosecution to intentionally cause this.
