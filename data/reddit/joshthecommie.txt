I don't know, he would probably say something stupid and people would believe him.

The ratio of beetcoin to usd is the same as unicorns to leprechauns

2 days ago I was thinking "I want to buy more bicoin, but I don't want to but at an ATH." Well, it went up 2k since then and now I'm thinking the same thing right now...
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:32:40
No one said anything about being unsupervised, I'm a minor and my dad was hesitant but let's my buy bitcoin now, he knows exactly how much I buy and when and how much it's all worth now
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:40:13
First rule of investing, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Not to be rude but that's just plain stupid
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:20
Didn't it go from 1500 to 300 once?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:42
I hate myself. 16.7k from 14.9k overnight :/
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:07:27
I'm 17 and I just had my dad put his info in for me. I still use my email and money for the account but for the other stuff it's all his. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:46
How? It's going to be back up to where it was sooner or later.

SIKE! Back to 15 lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:35:07
I just bought some at 14700 and I think I made the right decision. It started going back up in the last hour or so
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:50:11
I only got into bitcoin a few weeks ago and I did so because of the hope of the value going up. But that doesn't change the fact that I do believe in bitcoin and the idea of it. For me it's both
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:47:21
Awesome! I would love to see his reaction
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:26:53
Serious question, why are fees going up so much and is it going to keep getting worse? Won't this defeat the point of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:05:11
Same here, coinbase took 8 days my first time and it doesn't let me cancel anything
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:53:45
I kind of have the same question. Like all the memes about people who say they have bitcoin but only have X amount, at what point is that? How much is enough for people in the community to actually consider you in or something. I'm wording this pretty bad but I think you know what I mean
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:09:16
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:11:37
Can confirm, I know nothing
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:50:33
Well Im 17 and I'm not really putting much into bitcoin, and I'm also putting money into normal stocks at the same time. Even if I lost everything it would hardly matter, so it's almost an entirely educational experience
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:44:04
Bitcoin will be 100k tomorrow or I'll eat ice cream
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:36:43
It's not my fault they bought something they knew nothing about, yes I feel bad for them but that's just how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:47:31
Ok, thanks a ton for helping me out! I really appreciate it
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:46:06
Same question ^
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:18
I'm thinking about buying more rn, should i?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:11:53
Yep, I'm currently in high school and I spent an hour and a half the other day just reading about bitcoin at school. Send help
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:22:59
These comments are amazing 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:11:59
SHUT UP MOM IT'S NOT JUST A PHASE!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:03:38
Exactly, and investing in something as unstable as bitcoin is just insane.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:40:15
Thanks. So how long do you think it will take? I'm hoping it will be in less than a week when my limit resets so I can buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:14:39
You should charge a 10% finders fee or something lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:50:50
Awesome, thanks for your help
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:27:10
He wanted to buy bitcoin from the dude...
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:04:24
Is there a faster way to do it? Also, is this only for the first time buyers and will it get longer as bitcoin becomes more popular?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:48:55
No joke, thanks for posting this. I bought bitcoin for my first time on the 20th and it still hasn't gone through. It went up like 1000 dollars since then so im hyped lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:15:50
I would NOT trust this lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:52:59
Dang... how old are you? (If you don't mind me asking)
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:17:30
Same here, 250 bucks a week max is kinda retarded. Like why should a bank decide how fast I use MY money?
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:48:41
I hodl because I'm in the negative rn :/
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:09:20
So does this mean that if you own someone money they are required to accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:53:20
Only like 6 months because im new but I plan to for a while! 
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:49:25
Let him go to the bank, it would make their day lol 
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:47:28
LN sounds great, how do I use it?
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:42:55
Just about 6 months, just a little bit before the boom.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:49:37
One guy said that a million of them would be 7 cents .... So a lot
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:53:34
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:43:34
Wait... I thought bitcoin went to only 8 points behind the decimal? Also, what is LN?
