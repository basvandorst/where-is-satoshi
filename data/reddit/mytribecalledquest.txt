Yeah but it doesn't really seem like anything important's using it. So what's the point?

we need a lightning network

On the flip side, he'd probably feel smart that he did sell 5.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:32:53
I feel the same way. I'd much rather try and fail than to regret doing nothing at all.

A mesh network is still technically the internet.

Frankly this is the way most bitcoin companies should be doing it.

Awwww, too bad. :)

The real problem here is that basically nobody (a) knows what the difference between a segwit and a non-segwit transaction, and (b) how to perform a segwit transaction.

porque no los dos?

Well we do until everybody is off of fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:02:56
So like it is now?

Pretty sure most devs in crypto (myself included) are here for the money.
That being said, it would be a waste of our lives to spend all this time trying to make money with something *we didn't believe in*.

How can we use this against him?

Didn't Jihan the bullshitter not even study anything even remotely related to CS/Crypto?
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:42:40
Just you wait :~}

You could do a voting system like this on the Ethereum Blockchain, just saying...

If you made a Chef Cookbook to set this up, it would become super popular.

This guy seriously fucked up. He'll remember this mistake for the rest of his life. Frankly, he'll probably have nightmares about it.

Essentially all of these apt-get's and other setup commands on the hardware itself that comprise the majority of the setup of this miner could be automated.
Then basically anyone who wanted to setup the miner would only have to run around 2 commands to set the entire thing up after they'd put it together.
This is a pretty common thing to do in corporations with a lot of servers or VMs. Basically they need to describe the process of setting up a server once and then they can reuse the entire (often hundreds of commands long) recipe over and over again without having to basically do anything.
If you're at all interested, there's some more information here: 
It's a configuration language written in Ruby, so if you have any experience with programming before it's not too hard to setup.

I don't know, it is pretty shitty to compare the forking effort to The Jonestown Massacre...

Their credit card system has been completely broken for a few days now. I don't know how the fuck they think this is ok...
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:51:15
They do. I haven't had any issues.

Probably some place where the government isn't a bunch of controlling, freedom-hating fucks.

A few years ago they tried to make me pay a monthly fee for banking and I noped the fuck out to USAA. Never looked back.
