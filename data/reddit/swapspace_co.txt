It's directly connected with the network state. The more miners and the volume of their computing power, the more the hash rate.
@_date: 2019-07-24 13:02:07
yes, this is awesome
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:52:22
Definitely doing :)
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:53:54
Be careful :0
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:47:36
Do you mean mining pools?
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:14:33
This post was not written to show that Bitcoin is something bad, it's just information that I found entertaining :)
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:34:27
Yes, but none said that answer should be from integer field :) It's like thoughts about equation a\^2 = -1.
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:49:42
Unfortunately, you've got a mistake in this line:


The substitution was incorrect.
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:56:14
Correct! Сonsider this as clue. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:02:31
Very similar!  :D
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:23:59
No :)
@_date: 2019-06-06 22:57:47
We are talking about mining difficulty, not about hash rate. Check it here [
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:32:00
Exactly, it's the wild west.
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:19:54
nice try, but no
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:55:59
Do you think the payout will provoke more attacks?
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:25:32
Don't be so hard on yourself.   
If I hadn't created it, be sure I couldn't have solved it :D
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:40:08


do you want a clue?
@_date: 2019-06-06 22:05:57
Yes, you're right. So what do you think about news?
@_date: 2019-06-10 23:37:01
No one's ever called me that before  D:
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:50:41
 No :)
@_date: 2019-06-06 22:00:02
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:38:39
Yes, BTC is just a part of the crypto world. Progress and stability need more time in this field to become strong enough.
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:27:14
Just think of so many millons of Satoshis or just one stand.  The choice is made ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:50:28
What is dead may never die.
If you know what I mean :)
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:56:38
Thanks for the info. Will google it :)
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:36:50
Read about stable coins
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:14:21
Being new to the crypto is like being Indiana Jones, there are traps everywhere. Hard times for newbies
@_date: 2019-06-10 23:28:05
Probably this is their last purpose.
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:19:12
42  the Meaning of life, the universe, and everything I guess.  
But no, it's not 42 :(

I think when they were hacked, it wasn't a major headache.
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:17:09
Basically no. But firstly it connected with your geographical location
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:27:31
Nope, the real answer is not so beautiful.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:00:40
What should they do in this case?
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:20:16
There is no centralized point, where probably could be corruption. Plus absolutely transparent process that available to absolutely everyone.
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:40:15
can you send your calculations?
@_date: 2019-06-07 01:06:42
This guy who kicks the money remind me of "This is fine" meme
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:35:06
nice one
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:33:36
Yes, but the name comes directly from a science called cryptography
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:59:27
Excellent choice of MEME, sir.
