I'm curious enough in the product and the price is right.. I picked one up. Thanks for working around the existing broken system :)

Wow Ned.. they're not feeling the love for your colored coins here, are they? I'll be glad to take a few off your hands.

Did you just call my voice line? I really don't answer voice calls.
*Wow! I'm the first bitcoin order! Adam called just to say thanks. That's impressive customer service!

I've got to agree with I don't find any value in the colored coins distributed by but if they're free they're not hurting anyone. I wouldn't suggest that anyone go to the site and spend money or bitcoin on them.

Hey - I just received the Notebook and it looks just like I hoped! Thanks again for shipping it so quickly.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:05:04
Thanks again!

Sorry for being daft, but I currently regard Coinbase as an exchange. What is changing?

It might be worth noticing that the current range of the mtgoxlive window only ranges from $2.80 to $4.20. It would be easy to make a misleading interpretation while viewing such a small price window. Imaging what it might look like if the window ranged from $2 to $18 ... it might appear that there are still lots of bargains in the $3 range.

Found it!

Sorry, it looks like Google purged it from my box when I flagged it.

I would really love to see a private key -&gt; public key -&gt; bitcoin address generator in this spirit. I'm willing to give it a shot, though I don't know what support libre office has for sha256, ripemd160, and edcsa.
[This was interesting.. one of my first hits relates to someone trying to figure out the same process yesterday](

You're right, but I'm pretty sure it could go both ways.
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:07:11
I might watch this all day.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:45:41
Thanks for the save!
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:41:26
great! This might have the potential to take off!
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:57:37
Honestly? I thought bitcoin had become a dud and I shut down my miners and forgot about it. I have nothing to show for it.

Oh no! I accidentally declined the tip on mobile! Maybe you could try again? :)

A year later and I just noticed my typo.
