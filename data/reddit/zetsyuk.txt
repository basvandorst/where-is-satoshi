lol what a fear mongering little man post.  pseudoscience?  just because you grew up believing in govt pseudoscience doesn't make it false.  also, you obviously dont understand bitcoin.  i dont care how long you've been into it.  you dont understand it.  think about that.  alt-coins are crap.  bitcoin is decentralized.  and you're an illuminati shill.  gtfo here

@_date: 2017-04-09 17:19:44
this is GREAT.  first we were going to use litecoin as testnet for SegWit.  now Jihan is allowing us to test UASF on litecoin.  once we see successful UASF on litecoin, bitcoin will activate SegWit via UASF.  this is playing out perfectly.

Communist China, Socialist European Union, private central bankers, corporate rich fat cats.  oh and the Illuminati.
funny how btc thinks Core is illuminati bilderberg, yet I bet the DDoS attacks on BU are by BU themselves blaming Core and using it as a False Flag a la 9/11 et al.
oh BU is done for.  Core and SegWit have already won.

@_date: 2017-04-25 18:42:02






that's odd, i've never heard anybody say that segwit included a 2-4 MB block size increase.  i dont understand why jihan doesnt signal then since this is what he wants.  well, i have hope it will activate now.  thank you, luke.  just bought my first bitcoins in february right before the ETF rejection and still held onto them cuz i just know it is going to change everything.  thank you again

no worries, the good guys always win.  SegWit is activated in my eyes
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:10:37
andreas antonopolous has said we will need segwit and a block size increase in the future.  why can't we just all agree on segwit and then a 2mb increase later kinda like what the roundtable agreed upon?  2mb isn't a big difference from 1 mb is it?  anyway, thanks for answering in any case
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:02:40
maybe litecoin is only coin meant to get segwit and bitcoin is just a store of value.  decentralized protection comes at a price i suppose
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:05:50
dude, as a conspiracy guy, u should be worried more about BU and their president and board of investors.  
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:08:00
Charlie lee just tweeted it's time for Revolution and then liked my reply talking about time to activate UASF
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:25:28
but not in the form of a block size increase, right?  so are we not Ever going to do a block size increase as it would sacrifice security/decentralization?  if that is the case, i'm okay with that as long as we can scale in other ways.  
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:11:55

the sad thing is AXA could be funding blockstream just so they can make blockstream look bad cuz they know conspiracy folks (there are good ones and bad ones) will freak out and serve their agenda and support BU.  THAT is the conspiracy, folks.  
in reality, i'm over btc and their delusions.  they will wake up the hard way.  SegWit.

BIP149 can activate it by july 4th, 2018.  BIP148 July/August.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:53:41
i'm just saying, because big players like bitfury coinbase et al may be giving jihan the benefit of the doubt which i don't think he deserves at this point.  it's just freakin' obvious.  and now we're stalling for what?  for HIM?  relying on HIM?  that is a WEAK point that can now be taken advantage of.  but doesn't have to be if certain ppl step up and say it like it is.  or maybe they still believe jihan's lies.  when will they realize time is up?
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:21:04
also, i feel once segwit is activated, we won't have to worry about scaling nearly as much as in the future.  segwit will enable cross-chain swaps so we could micro-transact through litecoin/etc and bitcoin would stay decentralized no matter what while still being fast enough for larger more important transactions and store of value.
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:23:52
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:52:31
yes it is

he's right.  however, 5k is being humble
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:27:22
well, what about mimblewimble/tumblebit?  those need soft forks too?  just trying to see if ppl will be able to transact anonymously after segwit is activated w/o requiring ANOTHER soft fork

we should never allow bitcoin to EVER be dictated by a group of miners.  we're going to let a few miners and heads of exchanges/wallets dictate bitcoin?  how is that different than the fiat system we have now?  these ppl can be bought and paid for.

@_date: 2017-05-27 16:07:20
i got into bitcoin primarily because it's a store of value, that isn't degraded by inflation which we see with fiat which has lost over 90% of its value since the Federal REserve central bank was introduced in 1913.

is UASF an option and if so, when?
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:55:18
i see what you're saying but miners and others already see SegWit by itself as something promoted by Core.  i don't think a statement saying, "if miners won't activate SegWit, UASF would be the only way" as promoting it, just providing other viable options.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:00:51
i support BIP149 and feel SegWit can activate this way safely.  the July 4th Independence Day activation date is also a great touch
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:28:03
im not sure, ask in the slack channel for bitcoin.  it does take up a lot which is why big blocks would suck

there are certain things u have to to prior
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:23:43
u left out the most important part.  malicious miners
"We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. "

i support segwit plus 2mb.  while just doing segwit may be the most technically sound, i think honoring an increase to 2mb block size is due, just to show respect/honor to miners.  it's not black or white.  we should be working together, and trying to earn each other's trust and focus on unity, not division.  a 2mb HF would be pretty safe i feel and would have close to 100% consensus.

@_date: 2017-05-18 04:04:29
i agree, but the chinese miners are pissed.  we should do something to make each other trust each other again instead of debating so much.  sometimes being political needs to take precedence over the technical.  a 2mb hard fork shouldnt be a big deal as long as we get close to 100% consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:45:58
uh bitfury has already said they support bip148
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:13:50
so we will know by november whether we get segwit or chain split?
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:14:04
say we did activate segwit and then later HF'd to 2mb with 95% consensus (including BU), could BU ppl change their mind AFTER the HF and start mining on the 5% minority chain and turn it into a BU chain?  is that what everyone is concerned about?

@_date: 2017-05-24 18:18:45
very true.  personally tho, i am just following my intuition
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:17:02
it seems this is our best way to guarantee SegWit within a somewhat reasonable time frame should SegWit not activate by November or BIP148 doesn't garner 60% hash from miners.  
i'm not saying there is a deadline for SegWit to activate but it would seem the sooner and more Guaranteed, the better as long as it's done safely and supported by the community. 
bitcoin now only accounts for 51% of the cryptocurrency market.  bitcoin would become the vast majority % again with SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:26:29
it helps you and everyone.  bitcoin won't be worth a thing if it's not run by independent users, otherwise some nefarious actor could come in and control the whole network.  do you want that?  the beauty of bitcoin is decentralization.  yes, you have to work for it.  anything worth a damn takes work.  gotta get outta that fast food mentality.  
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:46:12
yeah, if it was up to me, we could just do segwit for now to see how it plays out.

@_date: 2017-05-17 02:02:39
im not worried about ripple.
but yeah, you'd think 2mb hard fork (w/ segwit) would be better sooner than later.  andreas has said we would need to scale both off and on chain
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:21:38
does that mean ETC is a scam too since it's Turing complete?
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:09:16
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:15:43
so BIP149 means we will get SegWit in July of 2018 guaranteed?  because it doesn't require any certain hash rate % threshold, correct?
so, this is definitely happening?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:35:05

it is a way to scale that is SAFE and keeps bitcoin DECENTRALIZED, meaning out of the hands of power of big corporations/companies/miners with big $/banks/etc.  keep bitcoin in the hands of the USERS and best developers in the world.  open-source, not closed-source.  TRANSPARENT!  FREEDOM!

@_date: 2017-05-16 22:52:00
you seem to think bitcoin is a commercial product which we can just upgrade whenever however bitcoin is popular because it is decentralized and that must be preserved at all costs because it is valued most and yes more than instant transactions.  yes, we want instant tx's, but keep it decentralized.  this isn't about commercial gains, bitcoin is highly political (or anti-political).  i see a lot of bitcoiners just wanna make money off it but dont see why bitcoin was invented in the first place.  it wasn't to buy coffee from across the world.  it was to transact without a third party.

@_date: 2017-05-12 17:54:08
as long as we can run nodes on the main chain, that's a TON better than a irreversible hard fork fxckfest
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:17:05
.. the whole point is to use segwit to speed up transactions.
why the fuck would you not use segwit?  do you want to pay high fees for slow transactions?
you awake in there?
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:51:13
i don't think, i'm saying it's very well a possibility.  
stop buying into mainstream media's false flags and false narratives for THEIR private agendas
they could be telling the truth.  but trusting it 100% is naive 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:42:48
ignorance doesn't have a place in big boy arena of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:56:33
yup, tis
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:13:23
coin.dance says like 99% of bitcoiners are guys.  ask the girls why they aren't in it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:49:12
i'm okay with segwit2mb personally
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:37:13
same thing happened to me with ETH.
screw shapeshift.  just use an exchange like GDAX
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:41:39
i guess im just trying to figure out if we will be able to do anonymous transactions w/o any government knowing what we buy/sell once segwit is activated, and WITHOUT another soft fork/hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:52:52
well i hope jihan would agree to that scenario but well, he hasn't.
@_date: 2017-05-01 03:00:39
semantics, buddy.  and if you're going to get your panties in a bunch over that, there's the door.

what socialists need to realize is that EVERYTHING would be so cheap and we wouldn't need welfare/safety nets/socialist programs because the free market would promote competition and extremely low prices on EVERYTHING, dirt cheap!  most ppl haven't seen TRUE capitalism, only CRONY capitalism
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:42:55
no i'm not that technical, ask in the uasf slack channel
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:48:07
i think jihan would be cool with segwit+2mb.  he said he love segwit in a tweet today.  even andreas has said segwit2mb may be best option.  i mean, jihan essentially agreed to a form of segwit2mb on litecoin at the litecoin roundtable before he started signalling segwit

if they continue to remain neutral, then i dont know how much hope i have for bitcoin.  you can't expect 100% decentralization, thus Core needs to take a stand.  it's obviously an emergency.  
ideally, we'd all be passive and things would work great decentralized.  however, i dont think we can expect 100% decentraliation, we can only MINIMIZE centralization.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:23:39
we are rising above the corporate globalists

@_date: 2017-05-26 17:21:52
no free bitcoin.  it makes sure bitcoin stays great and decentralized.
if it's centralized, then there's no point to bitcoin, you might as well use dollars
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:06:58
we should either just do segwit now and see how that goes and then evaluate to see if hard fork is needed
or just agree to segwit2mb
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:57:45
my question is, if we did segwit2mb and then had 2 chains, the old one and new one, could jihan go back to the old one and hijack it and turn it into BU bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:36:55
Shouldn't have to compromise with ONE guy.
regardless, hopefully with segwit + Lightning, we NEVER have to ever scale again.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:31:45
it's not.
go to bitcoin uasf slack channel.  they will guide you there.
if i can do it, anyone can.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:39:31
oh hey look, a rational plan!

the point is is that it's OPTIONAL. 
YOU don't have to use it and it WON'T affect you

he's not a libertarian.  and california says all you need to know about his statist ways where they make u vaccinate ur kids cuz corrupt ass medical mafia AMA says so!
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:30:42
you get to choose what version of bitcoin you run.  left up to bad actors, we'll get a bitcoin with rules they change to their benefit w/o our consent or say
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:39:08
better ensures we get segwit soon and keeps bitcoin centralized when you signal bip148
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:47:25
haha love this video after all these years, so epic

i'm moving on to more intelligent discussions since u can't keep up
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:58:05
my concern is that socialists like bitfury, andreas, coinbase, etc who are for SegWit will start to believe this bs.
i really am concerned about the kind of people involved with bitcoin.  bitcoin was created for libertarianism.  
not a commercial product to get rich off of.  that is just a SIDE benefit if it happens.
bitcoin is bigger than that, its puporse.  it's about ending govt's strangledeathchokehold deathgriop control on innocent people
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:04:04
with RSK, is ETC redundant?
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:00:27
if you really just want cheap fast centralized, go to litecoin or ripple.  why are you even in bitcoin?  oh yes, to get rich off others
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:18:27
the fact that it goes over your head doesn't change the facts of what i said.
