I get complaints for having created it daily.
@_date: 2012-05-16 07:32:02
Dwolla changed their TOS to disallow bitcoin transfers.
@_date: 2012-01-24 20:13:59
Probable deniability.
@_date: 2011-05-07 15:16:13
Been there. I always do my research before calling someone retarded.
@_date: 2011-05-17 01:29:18
They aren't just on user desktops or laptops though. I personally run about 8 bitcoin servers alone. 6 of those are on dedicated servers that do a variety of things (http, mysql, smtp/pop/imap, etc). I'm sure I'm not the only one. The variety of hardware running this infrastructure is unknown.
Also, when running it from a user's machine, I would still call it a server. Like I said, you're arguing semantics here. When I originally said 
 &gt; Bitcoin "clients" are run on real computers, sitting in datacenters
I didn't mean to convey that they exclusively run on machines like this, just that they also run on them.

I'll continue providing conversation as long as you continue replying. If you want me to leave you alone then you already know what to do.
I have my current setup because it's profitable. $800 worth of hardware has already paid itself off and it doesn't show any signs of slowing down. No market crash can take money that I've already traded out. I'm already set.

The first thing you need to do is pull your heatsink, if it looks rough then lap it, and re-install it with new thermal paste. Make sure the square bracket on the back is tensioned properly and your temps should get much better. That is definitely too hot.
@_date: 2011-05-24 03:24:26
Disclaimer: I don't work alone. My mining rig is part of a larger business.
My rig generates about 2.5kW of power. It's definitely profitable, but not by that much anymore. Anyway: 2.5kW is a decent amount, definitely enough to support a 16 plant grow or so.
@_date: 2011-06-04 19:40:07
What's your problem? What do you want to know? The entire spec is 100% public, all the code is open source. Anything you need to know is available. I'll help you out any way I can but I need to know what you're looking for, first.
@_date: 2011-05-18 00:27:32
You can just run poclbm with --help or something and it will list all the flags.
@_date: 2011-06-18 12:54:59
Well I'm pretty sure Matt has enough information now to find out who you are. Unless there were many of you "non-technical but fundamental" members. 
I smell something very fishy.
@_date: 2011-05-17 23:28:55
On stock clocks (850Mhz) I get 355MHash/s, at 900Mhz I get 376Mhash/s.
@_date: 2011-06-02 04:55:25
No, it hasn't been down at all.
It's just likely the network or the server can't handle the increased traffic from today. It's been horrendously slow and throws HTTP 502's everywhere but it hasn't been down all day.
@_date: 2011-05-19 01:33:00
The USPS is more than happy to oblige.
@_date: 2011-05-01 16:30:53
I'd get an expensive AMD card; my 5870 I bought a few weeks ago was $170, gets me 375mhash/s at 50mhz over stock clocks. It earns about $8 a day at the current exchange rates.
edit: retarded typo
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:03:44
I'll send you ten bitcoin for a hundred dollars, nothing less.
edit: offer was for the previous poster, and has since expired. Thanks for playing.
@_date: 2011-06-18 12:51:54
Amen. This speculation gets old.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:58:24
I tracked down his email from the bitcoinj project hosted on google code.
It's hearn if anyone wants to verify. I sent him an email asking if he's the one who did this and if it is I'll send him a small donation for my gratitude.
@_date: 2011-05-01 18:13:40
Yeah, I shouldn't post so early in the morning. I got it on Newegg. XFX had them for sale for $190, with a $20 MIR. I think bitcoin made the price spike up to what it is now.
@_date: 2011-05-16 01:26:56
Because it costs money to run a server, don't be greedy.
@_date: 2011-06-02 04:56:22
What order? I never heard you say anything.
@_date: 2011-05-10 23:40:19
What server is bitcoin-watch on?
@_date: 2011-05-10 15:09:35
Don't use slush, he has been experiencing a lot of downtime lately. Also don't listen to these pooled mining fools. If you get anywhere near a gigahash I recommend mining on your own.
@_date: 2011-07-05 20:54:04
Just how exactly do you explain a line chart going backwards in time?
@_date: 2011-05-04 00:29:02
I mine with a triple 5870 setup at work and they have the same hash rate on a x4 lane as they do with a x16 lane. You really aren't going to see any difference.
@_date: 2011-05-19 00:56:14
I don't need a citation. Many black markets have popped up on the Internet as of late. They use a network service called Tor and Bitcoin. If you would like to investigate for yourself I can give you some leads, but they're real.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:45:46
FUCK YEAH
@_date: 2011-05-04 22:56:08
I verified that the device numbers were correct. The CPU is zero, the graphics cards are 1 and 2.
@_date: 2011-05-11 14:39:41
Yes. You don't use GUIMiner, you use m0mchill's poclbm most likely. 
First off, download the latest as of May 1st: 
Here is my script that I use, put it in a batch file in the root of the folder that contains "poclbm.exe."
 &gt; poclbm.exe -u username --pass=password -o mtred.com -p 8337 -v 2 -w128 -f 0 -d 0 
The only part you need is
 &gt; poclbm.exe -u username --pass=password -o mtred.com -p 8337
@_date: 2011-05-03 22:14:26
What temps are you seeing? If I keep my case horizontal and put another fan or two on the card I can keep it at 69C, 100% load, at 900mhz. If the case is vertical, nothing I do can keep it below 75C.
@_date: 2011-05-17 23:09:08
Also if you upgrade to the latest poclbm miner and run it with -f0 -w128 you can get closer to 375Mhash/s.
@_date: 2011-05-10 15:11:23
I own bitcoins and definitely don't *ahem* purchase anything illegal with them at all.
@_date: 2011-05-01 03:07:01
First off, I'm not angry. I don't give a shit what you do with your money. I also wasn't the one that said "nobody's gonna buy once the bubble bursts so we're gonna lose." You have me mistaken for someone else.
The only thing I want to establish is that automated trading isn't anything special. You're fooling yourself if you think you have an advantage over the leagues of people using bitcoin who are smarter than you or I.
@_date: 2011-05-01 01:55:16
The MtGox API is public, Python is dead simple. How many of us do you think have something identical setup?
Shit, I'm not even heavily involved in it and that's the first project I finished. Estimate moving average, calculate average rate for the past half hour, compare to moving average, buy or sell based on how far above or below moving average we are. I even made the code public.
@_date: 2011-05-11 04:08:19
It's in a state of disarray. I'm working on switching to the same mainboard so I can PXE all this shit.
@_date: 2011-05-08 17:06:51
I'm going to start solo mining now.
@_date: 2011-05-16 06:04:48
Bitcoin "clients" are run on real computers, sitting in datacenters. Just like the web servers for MtGox, MyBitcoin, or even reddit.
Sure we can run them on a desktop, but typically an infrastructure like this is powered by servers.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:45:25
Google had me change my account password. I had 2-factor on as well. It was two non-dictionary words stacked together with two numbers on the end.
A+ to google for recognizing the threat far before I did. I didn't even put two and two together that my GMail account might be threatened.
@_date: 2011-06-01 23:45:52
No. They just banned guns and prostitution. Electronics and digital services and etc. are still valid for the Silk Road.
@_date: 2011-07-23 21:42:35
It isn't, it would be third party.
@_date: 2011-05-03 15:05:38
Use poclbm for Windows, I mine on [slush's pool](
What video card are you looking to mine with? Make sure to check that your hash rates match your card on the [mining hardware comparison](
@_date: 2011-05-11 03:00:12
I've got about 3 gigahashes between 8 6950s and 2 5870s. Please PM me, I /will/ join this pool. I'd like to talk logistics.
Here's a [pic]( for a bit of proof.
@_date: 2011-07-07 04:58:07
It was much earlier than 2000. I was taught single-space typing in the middle 90's.
@_date: 2011-05-07 14:42:46
You're retarded. There's no calculation for division by zero.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:17:48
I heard it was the guy who runs bitcoinj.
@_date: 2011-05-27 13:18:00
I've never put money into MtGox from dwolla. I've only taken USD out.
@_date: 2011-05-11 13:56:22
Quick learner on port forwarding: a port number is used to connect to a specific service on a remote computer. Your bitcoin miner is trying to connect to mtred.com, port 8337. (Not the other way around.) Why you are forwarding your own port 8337 is beyond me.
That means that you are forwarding your_wan_ip:8337 to some internal host on your subnet. You're not running a server, nobody needs to connect to your internal subnet.


is all the configuration you're going to need.
@_date: 2011-04-30 14:53:13
A recent quad core processor gets about 4Mhash/s. A proper GPU for bitcoin mining gets around 400Mhash/s. It's going to cost you more money than it generates to use a CPU miner. I recommend turning the setup off and just buying bitcoin with the money you saved on your power bill.
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:32:54
Haha, no. That's the whole point of this.
@_date: 2011-05-27 00:31:55
Dwolla took 8 days to transfer my $800 USD. FUCK them.
@_date: 2011-05-05 14:58:09
Well, we have a lot of commodity hardware running our mining rigs. Some of the boards available don't have crossfire support. (nForce chipsets) Crossfire isn't even there in the CCC.
@_date: 2011-05-16 23:47:37
I also want to add that P2P means nothing other than decentralized. It just turns every client into a server. It doesn't eliminate a service's need for a server.
@_date: 2011-05-11 15:11:20
Not a problem I'm glad to have helped. Happy mining!
@_date: 2011-06-02 04:58:11
It's like finding a needle in a haystack. Many drugs don't even smell or have significant size. Hash can be flattened, vacuum-sealed, and placed in birthday cards. LSD can be sent mixed with paper, it looks just like another layer of card stock.
@_date: 2011-06-17 04:42:48
I've paid rent with bitcoin before. Beat that!
@_date: 2011-05-24 03:25:45
People like me thank people like you.
@_date: 2011-05-10 15:19:41
Your earnings will even out over time. You don't make "more" with a mining pool your small earnings are spread out over time. There is no gigahash rule, it's just an approximate range where I consider solo mining worth it.
I've got about 3 gigahashes total and I still used slush's pool up until a few days ago when his server started going to shit.
@_date: 2011-06-18 20:35:01
My boss has made about $5000 since January of this year mining and trading bitcoin. Suck my dick.
@_date: 2011-05-11 14:25:03
Post your entire mining script here and I'll help you. Make sure to edit your username and password.

Someone needs to buy that guy a beer. I think he's on github, I'm going to find his public btc address and send him a donation.
@_date: 2011-05-16 23:34:45
There aren't official servers, correct. Most people don't understand that your typical home connection does not have the same bandwidth available that a dedicated line on a server would. An infrastructure is supported by a wide variety of servers in a variety of places. Also any desktop computer can be a 'server.' Don't get caught up in semantics. There are bittorrent servers (trackers) and bittorrent servers (clients) that 'serve' content to the other peers. The terms are loosely used.
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:32:07
What.. exactly are you offering?
@_date: 2011-06-17 13:47:45
I live with my brother, he paid rent. I paid him bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-07-12 14:12:28
This article is shit, your concept is shit. The other commentors have already established why. 
What performance are you getting out of the supposed 8Ghash/s of power available to you? How does this compare to a 6950 or a 5870 cluster in terms of speed and power consumption?
@_date: 2011-05-18 17:14:34
A lot of people buy drugs using bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-12-18 08:36:50
Not at all.
