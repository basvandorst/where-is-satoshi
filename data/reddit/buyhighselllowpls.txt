I feel ya brother. Bought in yesterday only to see the whole market crash like all hell broke lose..
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:35:33
No bad news really. Been keeping up with the news since market was pretty stable and even a whiff of bad news could have tipped it into a dump mode however, this was totally crazy. I mean this is just plain and simple bad. Hopefully it will recover back upto 6800 quick... FUCK KNOWSS.. Manipulation is what it is..
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:37:51
Sorry for the over reaction. Last I saw BTC was holding 6800 and the next moment I opened Bin it was 6350.... Brain just exploded.

Asians woke up man. It's the asians..

Utterly disgusting. I can't even sell at this point. OMG every thing is bleeding like it's a slaughter house. I don't even have enough OMG's to type.... Oh and yes I am panicking.. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:24:14
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:39:23
Exactly. It happened once, won't happen this time. Maybe next year... For now the max it might be able to touch would be 7800 if we are extremely lucky. I was hoping for that but market had other plans for me and completely crushed my dreams..
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:28:34
TOTALLY GOT REKT. TOTALLY. FUCKING DESTROYED MY LIFEEE. OMG I might just have a heart attack..
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:03:30
Dump coming.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:27:54
At this rate it will be there in next few minutes..
@_date: 2018-09-24 11:30:37
Looks like going down for now..
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:30:43
JHEEZUS HELP US....

Don't jynx it.

ETH was and is still considered 'Legit' yet it will die off very soon, coins that were considered to have a bright future like ONT, ICX and ADA will slowly end as well. Not trying to be a fudster but even all those attaching their hopes with ETF (I was one of them) and saying that ETF will eventually pass, will be pretty shocked when the actual decision finally comes out in early 2019..  
This was a quite a sick scam started by someone we don't even know who. For all we know it could just be some government.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:40:25
He is the whale...
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:18:03
In current state of market I am only looking to lock in my profits and not shoot for the moon. Trying to slowly accumulate more coins for when the Moon Lambo bull run comes.
The market value tanks instantly due to manipulation it's mind boggling. Lol.
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:23:57
We are about to crash right now. Possibly going below 5.8k again. Wait and watch it happen in the next 12 hours.
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:09:24
If ETF gets accepted and we hit 9k by November, just watch how all these people going to start claiming 20k, 30k, 50k by christmas.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:38:51
Need to add 20 billion into the market. BRB gonna give Bezos a quick call..
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:49:16
Again, looking at 'a few months' picture.  
Thanks for the good luck, lol. Whatever happens, I will not regret my investment since it produced hefty ROI for me and even if btc goes down to a couple penny's, I would end up in green..
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:36:56
Well, it is going to drop back under 6k soon now..
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:05:30
Bull run just dropped right back on it's face..
@_date: 2018-08-30 09:30:25
WE BLEED REDDD!!!!
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:25:55
I remember the days where they were predicting 100k by this Christmas.. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:45:18
Lol, I have lost about the same...
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:45:47
At this rate.. Not for long.... Poor ALTS tho...
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:20:25
Totally agree with you and as I said before, it's highly unlikely that ETF will be passed this year but it's just an 'IF' and  just a conspiracy theory.. And if it does become true, let's call it the 'Q4 Theory of Crypto'...  
Maybe not..
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:08:13
That is what I am saying. Pretty much every alt and bitcoin is at the same point it was over a year ago. Especially all the top 20 one's.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:36:58
More like obliteration...
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:08:38
I doubt there will be a recovery to even 10k if that occurs. I think we will be playing in the 5800-6200 support level for a while before we collapse to the 5500 support level and then the lowest fall would be around 5200 but I feel like this would occur for the next few weeks and by then a small bull run might come in due to the anticipation for the ETF decision and then after a delay we would crash again, let's not even think about what a Rejection would do. But then in November the Bakkt would come into play which would defo push the Bitcoin's value upwards and we might get stuck in the mid 6k again till the February 2019 SEC'S ETF Decision which would  either start the bull run 2019 or cause a massive drop in the price to the eventual possibility of touching under $3k but then slowly over couple of years BTC's price will defo rise as the actual Tech would get developed and other stupid Alt's die.

Buddy, you can not change a thousands of years old system in a couple of years.. And I totally agree with the claims of the 'masses' that Crypto will not take over the 'FIAT' system, defo not in next 5,10,20 years or so. But it is an alternative, an alternative that is in it's very very early age of development. The 'Fiat' system has been around for thousands of years but people still used the good old barter system for many hundreds of years refusing the 'confusing' new system.  
We are moving to the age where cars drive themselves, people will be going to space for 'trips' when a few hundred years ago a person could dream to take a trip to the next country.. You have robot butlers and much more insane stuff that was considered ultimately insane, stupid, dumb and impossible just a few decades ago.  
Bitcoin or crypto community does not need 'a lot of people on board' we need solid development and that is what would attract the real game changers, real influencers of change. The idea of losing fiat is daunting, I am ngl, I am trying to make money off this atm too because currently I need to feed myself, pay for staying alive but that doesn't mean I am not investing in the tech. I am profiting off a system I believe in, just like the masses profit trading Forex.
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:54:20
Uhm, I mean no one really knows these things but there are people who were smart enough to start buying around when it was under 200's and started selling after hitting 19k-20k and became guess what... THEY BECAME FILTHY RICH IN THEIR LAMBO'S... That's smart.. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:02:32
I agree you can't time the market but that is exactly why you don't sell your whole stack at once. If you have gone from 100-20k You dump it out slowly and when something as obvious as the current bear market becomes you take your profit and re-enter the market slowly again. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:57:26
Thanks man. I actually gave up a couple months ago. I mean, I have already lost 90% of my investment. I won't take it out. If it goes to 0 fine, if it goes up by 200% great. Lol
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:06:12
We broke 7100 and dropped right back...
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:08:17
Except they can just hide behind their money and claim that their 'Analysis' shows that. Frigging clueless idiots trying to just get PR.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:35:38
Dude's opinion is just his sentiment since he can not even base his opinion on anything legitimate. Someone who says Global warming is just a hoax even after having all the scientific proof anyone could ever ask for, that person's opinion can not even be considered..
It's just his angry sentiment against Bitcoin since he lost his 'Investment', he came in Bitcoin to make some easy money like all the other's, not understanding the value of the actual tech and ended up getting burned like many.  
As far as I can understand from reading his posts is that he is just angry about his loses and just generally unhappy and angry about his life. so he is spreading such baseless 'opinions' of his in order to feel good perhaps?
  
Hope you feel better dude.
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:02:55
Wait till everyone dumps it once the ETF gets rejected tomorrow..
@_date: 2018-08-30 10:43:59
That's like $100 no?
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:43:33
It may reach 5800 approximately or 8000 approximately.. Nobody knows..
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:10:20
We go up slowly, we fall down quickly. Frigging bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:19:24
It's always good to be prepared for the worst. It hurts less.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:38:29
Buddy it's just hypothetical. Not claiming anything.
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:44:20
Brah, wtf? I am not claiming this.... Was going through some articles and found this. Thought I'd throw another ridiculous 'Expert' analysis on here.
And btw being on reddit for a week or 3 months doesn't make you an expert. Most of the redditors are just a bunch of kids.
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:30:55
Can't take people seriously when they quote Mike Novogratz's predictions. I get it he is an accomplished individual but God, get over it. Nearly all of his Crytpo predictions have been Shiteee. Like look at this..
