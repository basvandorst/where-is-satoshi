I have a few suggestions:
1. We definitely need a minimum limit on tipping. The 1 satoshi tips are annoying. That limit would be default for all subs unless over-rided by a mod, that way we can have exclusive subs (with minimum tip, say $5) like The minimum limit can be dynamic, say 1 cent. This way, we wouldn't have to change limits as it fluctuates.
2. Making it private by default would encourage fake tipping so I suggest you keep it as it is. RES can be modified to hide bot's posts.
3. This is really sad! Some people just want to watch the world burn! Make a comment saying "Insufficient funds" and on repeated fakes, say 3, message the mods to ban the account. Hopefully, it'll stop after some time.
I posted [this]( in changetip yesterday but I think it got lost in the flood of comments.

I lowered the sound for video. When I reopened that, the volume bar shows my lowered sound but it still plays in full sound. I have to click anywhere in the volume bar to readjust.

a "donate" link which will donate it to the default set in profile and a "select" option which opens a list to select from.

Looks cool! Maybe change the color on wrong answer to red instead of yellow, just a suggestion. (i'm more accustomed to green for correct answer, red for incorrect and yellow for compilation error)
and maybe have some contests (or challenge problems/puzzles) which will motivate users to learn more!

New users, go to  and under My Projects, select any project and play those games. They will give you a motivation to learn more.
P.S. [Minesweeper]( has a bug. Let's see who finds out first!
