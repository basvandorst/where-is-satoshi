So are these two different interviews completely? And did they both occur around when they were posted on youtube, one on December, 2010, and then other March, 2009.
If so then in the March 2009 one he is probably talking about bailouts and getting out of the credit crunch, when the Fed really need to print a ton of money as the banks had no money and were going to become illiquid. 
In December 2010 I believe we still might have been in a recession, but not in the midst of a crisis at that point. At this point politicians were probably worried about what they are always worried about when it comes to the Fed: inflation. Politicians hate inflation, and the Fed is given a strong mandate to avoid it. A lot of people were saying his policies will cause inflation so he had to make a strong stance that they would not. He ended up being right as we did not fall into an inflationary trap.
Correct me if I am wrong and if they are the same interview, as I honestly do not have time to watch the whole interview right now but will do so later if this explanation does not suffice. The Fed definitely does different monetary policies at different times, some times it involves putting money into the economy and other times it involves taking money out.

curious, what was the argument for why bitcoin would succeed now that China is starting to use bitcoin?

I bet these are out of context judging by the cuts and edits. He very likely could be talking about monetary policy the fed was doing at different times. Given the economic troubles at times the Fed needs to put more money into circulation, at other times it needs to do more deflationary policies.
It would be nice to see the whole interview before claiming the Fed is a scam.

seriously, IBM has been around for 40 years going from hardware to software to services. They are one of the most innovative companies you can find.

And I think the main tech investment by him is Microsoft. I think he publicly said he doesn't understand how to value FB so he won't invest in it.
Buffett is a value investor and his favorite ratio is p/b, which works great for financials but not so much for tech stocks with a lot of hype. People in this subreddit don't understand his investment philosophy and are making comments when they don't even understand what they are talking about.
