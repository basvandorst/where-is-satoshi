With you being located in the United States, all exchanges that allow you to buy cryptocurrency with fiat currency will ask for your SSN. Of all of the exchange options, [GDAX and Coinbase]( (owned by the same company) are likely the safest option.
Why [GDAX is considered a safe exchange](
* The company is based in San Francisco and has received over $200m in VC funding.
* Customer funds are segregated from company operational funds.
* The vast majority of crypto funds are held in secure offline storage.
* The remaining hot wallet funds are insured.
* U.S. customers' USD funds are FDIC insured.
It's highly recommended that you enable 2 factor authentication through Google Authenticator for your account. As
mentioned, you also should highly consider moving your funds to a hardware wallet after your done.

Of the three exchanges you listed, Bitfinex is the only one that allows you to deposit, withdrawal, and trade using fiat currency (USD, EUR). However, they do not accept users from the United States (if that's where you're located) and they require new users to deposit $10,000+ before being able to trade (greater than your $1000 amount).
Binance and Bittrex ([see detailed comparison here]( only deal in cryptocurrency, meaning you can only trade cryptos for other cryptos. Both exchanges offer a huge variety of altcoins to trade, although recently Binance has been more active in adding new coins. Bittrex has recently [temporarily suspended]( new account signups, so they can make upgrades to their customer support and backend systems.
This leaves Binance as the best option for trading altcoins for most users. 
Binance ([see review here]( is  currently the world's most active [cryptocurrency exchange]( in terms of trade volume. They offer a variety of benefits over other altcoin focused exchanges:
* Very low fees (0.1%)
* Consistently adding new coins
* Only require verification if you want to increase your withdrawal limits above 2 BTC / 24 hours.
* Better customer support (although definitely not perfect) than most
* Highly liquid markets
* Web Based Platform, Desktop Platform, and Mobile App can all be used to trade on Binance.
