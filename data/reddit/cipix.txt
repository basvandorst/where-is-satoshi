Well said.  
And remember this: Bitcoin is a protocol, not a currency. Currency is just the first app.   
Bitcoin is an experiment in the separation of money and state. You’ll be surprised how many will support that

no worry soon the Russians can use bitcoin.bit ...
 I will quote Andreas again here: "Banks (government) warn of dangers of bitcoin because people already know of the dangers of banks and are looking for choices"
 "Bitcoin is global, decentralized and unstoppable. Let govt try, it will be hilarious to watch."

I have to mention here a "strange coincidence" (if someone still believe in coincidences :)).  
Every time when a country/leader wants to ditch the dollar and instate a gold backed economy, that country /leader was harassed or at the end dead. Just investigate for yourself these facts:  
- In Romania, Ceausescu, paid all the debt to IMF in '87 or '88 and he wants a gold backed economic treaty with communist block. Then in '89 he was shot in the head by "revolutionaries".  
- In '90 Sadam Hussein wants to sell his oil for EUR, RUB and gold... Again was invaded and killed.   
- in 2007-2008 Ghadafi  started to promote the gold dinar in all African countries... In 2011 Ghadafi was killed.  
- Iran is selling his oil to china and other countries in gold, yuan, rubbels etc... Systematically they are harassed.  
- Russia/Putin start to trade in rubbles, yuan and buying lots of gold... They want to get rid of him (Putin) making several plots (see Ukraine) and stupid sanctions, just to push the start of another war with Russia. Poking with a stick the big bear is not a good idea....  
I wonder now how will be the attitude to bitcoin next years...
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:00:39
Focus on adoption not on price people!  
Bitcoin is a protocol, not a currency. Currency is just the first app. What comes next will be very disruptive.  
Don't think how much cost now in USD 1 BTC... think how much goods you can buy with 1 BTC in 4-5 years !  
If you want to get rich now immediately, play lottery in fiat.  
Bitcoin is not a lottery!
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:42:36
Yeah is right. Do something productive.  
Don put your fiat anymore in pension funds. HODL and later you will have for your retirement a fortune!  
Don't put your fiat in your child savings account for studies, save in a btc wallet and later your child can go to the best university paid in BTC...  
Focus on adoption not on today's price.  
Think how much goods you can buy in 4-5 years with BTC

I have to mention again the great quotes of Andreas:  
"Bitcoin won’t “destroy” banks. Like the Internet did with telcos and media, It will simply make banks less relevant and less powerful."  
"You are guaranteed to lose your bitcoin investment if you sell at the bottom of a dip. If you hold, you have a chance for recovery."  
"In the last 3 months, the pace of development by bitcoin tech companies has increased at least 10x. Hundreds of developers joining per month." - that saying a lot already...  
"The vast majority of western societies has no clue what bitcoin is, yet. As they discover it and adopt it, we will keep growing."  
"Bitcoin’s success is owed to creativity and innovation. It has nothing to do with the government’s endorsement"  
"Those who make the mistake of thinking bitcoin is expensive today are going to miss two orders of magnitude in next year." - I like very much this one
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:33:02
The point is that the bitcoin transactions will not reply 100% on internet based connection. Even if they will spy the transactions will not obtain too much information.

@_date: 2015-01-18 14:16:00
None of the "cloud" storage are safe, for the simple fact that you are not 100% in control.  
Make your own cloud with your own NAS if you are travelling a lot and need to access your files.  
Regarding a keeping a wallet, a text file with your 12 words is the worst solution.  
Put your 12 words in 12 different files, for example 12 images with your family containing (in a specific order) those words. You can even have a website with some pictures... Use your imagination, don't be stupid to keep your wallets in a cloud.

I will upvote those faucets that will put ads from real bitcoin businesses not just shity google ads.   
Why they don't contact for example all Bitcoin Boulevard businesses to put each one a banner on those faucets.   
In this way the faucet's users will earn directly from those bitcoin ads, the owners will have also promoted their business and some will spend the coins earned in that faucet into the same businesses that was promoted.  
I saw a lot of faucets that promote just another faucet refferals - this is stupid! Promote a real bitcoin business !

Thanks. I tried to put here a warning alert to be more vigilant, but in this subreddit there are a lot of trolls, who knows, maybe are those paid by NSA, to create more confusion and apart the people from the truth or at least don't letting them to think and ask more. I think people lost their functionality to think and ask simple questions.  
I don't want that Ross to be jailed for something that he didn't do. I think he's just a patsy and he will be absolutely fine at the end. People don't understand that not Ross is important in this case...

People who say that bitcoin is not or cannot become a “valid currency” are ignoring the simple, demonstrable fact that it already is.  
But will take a while until more and more people will realize that the banks are robbing/enslaving them and then will find out about the "beauty" of Bitcoin (like protocol) and the bitcoin (like currency).  
Those who will not adopt it now, later will run like crazy to buy some (with what price...) because nobody will accept anymore FIAT from banks.  
Bitcoin won’t “destroy” banks. Like the Internet did with telcos and media, It will simply make banks less relevant and less powerful.  
Banks warn of dangers of bitcoin because people already know of the dangers of banks and are looking for choices.

0 &lt; 0.01 mathematically. For sure you will not get rich from faucets. As I said: I use the faucets to test wallets and for fun.   
But remember the first transaction of BTC was about 10k BTC for a pizza?! Are you ready to pay the same amount now for a pizza?   
Soon you will pay 0.01BTC for a pizza. How that sounds for you?!

My intention wasn't to have a cult of Andreas. I lived 18 years in an oppressive communist country and believe me I know better than many from here what is a cult of personality.  
I don't want anymore to happen that.

 Don't you get it?!!  
 The whole case was created by government (see the "inside" SK gov agent) just to discredit the bitcoin in eyes of MSM and rest of the people that still don't understand bitcoin.  
 The Silk Road, Pirate Dread, Karpless etc from the beginning was just some patsies to catch those who buy drogs on internet and to discredit all the bitcoin supporters.  
 Like Andreas said: "Banks warn of dangers of bitcoin because people already know of the dangers of banks and are looking for choices."  
 "Most people are yet to understand how disruptive the Bitcoin technology really is." - I think the gov already understand it and is doing everything possible to discredit it, because it can't be shut it down, just slowing down the adoption...  
 Think again and don't let you fooled by all the news. All are just to distract you from other facts that are more important but they don't want you to know.  
- Questions to ask:  
 - How the "undercover" agent was hired for SK for an admin job. We don't have this information, we know only that he was chatting with DPR. To be admin for a web like this is not easy to be accepted. Or maybe that "admin" is the creator of the SK.  
 - If that agent has access to see the location of DPR just chatting, why they didn't localize also all the clients that used SK to sell/buy drogs. So all those users are not prosecuted... So this is the War on drogs guys, a fakery.  
- Do you really think that DPR will use a normal unprotected WiFi connection without any VPN protection when he was chatting or connecting to SK?  
- Who will benefit from this?

I think this will be a lesson for all newbies: once you create your wallet, encrypt and save it in other safe storage (not cloud storage). Takes exactly 10 seconds and 2 clicks. Is not so complicated.   
After that the wallet.dat can brake in million of pieces, stolen or lost.  
You just have to open it again from that safe storage and all your coins are back...

I don't use too much the faucets, only sometimes when want to test some wallets.  
But I found this one that have a jackpot also. Working pretty well. At the beginning I thought the jackpot is a scam but after 1 week playing once in a while I won the jackpot 1mil satoshis (shits).  
Here is the balance, no refs no nothing just playing once in a while.  
  
  
  
For all noobs I recommend to start using a faucet. But remember this is not for earning too much and be rich in btc. Find a job that pays you in btc. Use faucets just for fun and testing.  
BTW my daughter plays faucets and in 1 year earned 1BTC! In 2013 I explained her about bitcoin and from that moment she was amazed how easy you can earn some money online. She have also open her own online shop selling for bitcoins some girly stuff.  
Another thing I want to bring in this discussion is that I don't see any faucet that is promoting ads from real bitcoin businesses. I mean whay all are using the shity google ads with stupid ads from non-bitcoin related businesses, instead of contacting directly the businesses from a Bitcoin boulevard for example and sell them a banner space. So will be a win-win situation for all 3 involved. The owner of the shop for promoting his bussines in a bitcoin space, the faucet users can spend their bitcoin in those shops, the faucet owners having all together.

They focus on price speculation of bitcoin but they didn't focus on Bitcoin (with B).  
Like Andreas said: "Bitcoin is a protocol, not a currency. Currency is just the first app"...

Right. I do the same for 2 years already. 5 nodes with empty/no use wallets. 5 copies of blockchain. If I need to open a wallet.dat (kept) safe/encrypted in offline storage, I just have to copy it into data folder and use it. But normally I use Multibit and Electrum like desktop wallet.  
Also you can use a common repository for the data node folder. For example a NAS and other PCs pointing to the same location in network folder. In case you want to save space. But now the HDD prices are cheap so you can dedicate 1 HDD for your node. Will be enough for 20 years I think.

The pension funds in fiat doesn't make sense anymore. Inflation. So I can afford to lose all the fiat invested in pension fund and HODL some BTC for later.

Spanish gov and parties are so fracking corrupted...   
For much they want to stop it, that much will bring attention to the masses and at the end even if 10-20% of those will realize and understand what is really bitcoin, will be enough to contra balance the gov bad move.  
Here some quotes:  
In many countries around the world, if a government bans bitcoin it will instantly be more credible as an alternative choice.  
Bitcoin is regulated by math. Banks are regulated by committees that are either completely powerless or entirely "captured" by those they regulate.  
Bitcoin doesn’t just disrupt money. It also disrupts the models of modern corporations, macro-economics, nation-states and the Internet.  
Bitcoin is global, decentralized and unstoppable. Let govt try, it will be hilarious to watch.  
Countries rejecting bitcoin reminds me of the time when countries were resisting the Internet.

The rest just HODL and buy more for cheap price. Then wait.   
Will see later who will gonna laugh LOL   
These 90% of trolls will need years to really understand what is Bitcoin.   
Just reading their posts title and you know for sure that they didn't read any of Satoshi's papers or Andreas book. Just sheeple.

Last days I just earn a jackpot of 1 million satoshis. I know is not too much but I use these faucets just for fun and for testing wallets etc.   
Here some screens:       
And in the last days they just doubled the prizes.  
I don't understand why not the bitcoin businesses are not contacting these faucets to promote their business. So will be a win-win situation for all 3 parts implicated: users, faucet owners, business owners.
@_date: 2015-01-16 11:38:39
I wonder why the faucets are not using famous Andreas quotes instead of these "subliminal" messages. Will be  better to understand bitcoin :) and more entretainment
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:46:37
Guys, why don't you just stop following this case fakery?  
 Don't you get it?!!  
 The whole case was created by government (see the "inside" SK gov agent) just to discredit the bitcoin in eyes of MSM and rest of the people that still don't understand bitcoin.  
 The Silk Road, Pirate Dread, Karpless etc from the beginning was just some patsies to catch those who buy drogs on internet and to discredit all the bitcoin supporters.  
 Like Andreas said: "Banks warn of dangers of bitcoin because people already know of the dangers of banks and are looking for choices."  
 "Most people are yet to understand how disruptive the Bitcoin technology really is." - I think the gov already understand it and is doing everything possible to discredit it, because it can't be shut it down, just slowing down the adoption...  
 Think again and don't let you fooled by all the news. All are just to distract you from other facts that are more important but they don't want you to know.
Questions to ask:  
 - How the "undercover" agent was hired for SK for an admin job. We don't have this information, we know only that he was chatting with DPR. To be admin for a web like this is not easy to be accepted. Or maybe that "admin" is the creator of the SK.  
 - If that agent has access to see the location of DPR just chatting, why they didn't localize also all the clients that used SK to sell/buy drogs. So all those users are not prosecuted... So this is the War on drogs guys, a fakery.  
- Do you really think that DPR will use a normal unprotected WiFi connection without any VPN protection when he was chatting or connecting to SK?  
- Who benefits from this?

Yes definitely. Bitcoins is nothing about Satoshi, is about the protocol.
@_date: 2015-01-17 23:04:22
Andreas should go more often and having speech in universities, schools, colleges. To teach and wake up the young.  
For us, the already bitcoiners, we already know what he will say, we don't need a preacher, we need a teacher for the new to come.  
His book should be from now on every single hands of a young to study it.  
I wonder how many bitcoiners tried to explain how bitcoin works in few words to a young. I heard a lot of stories where they said: oh my grandma will never know how to secure her wallet. Of course she will never know. She will have less to live to see the bitcoin thriving. Teach your kid, your young friends etc and bitcoin will thrive.

All of these polls and questions about how much you have in btc makes me think are just another trap of NSA to know if they will launch another Silk Road trap version 9999 just to seize more coins...  
Don't you get it? SK was created by NSA just to fool you.

That's because of greedy cloud mining pools. Charging higher fees for their loses.

"Banks warn of dangers of bitcoin because people already know of the dangers of banks and are looking for choices."  
The governments of the world have spent hundreds and hundreds of trillions of dollars bailing out a decaying, dickensian, outmoded system called banking, when the solution to the future of finance is peer-to-peer. It’s going to be alternative currencies like bitcoin and it’s not actually going to be a banking system as we had before 2008
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:02:42

Patience, patience. We are just in the earliest stage of the Bitcoin revolution.  
When all the trolls from this sub will really understand WHAT is Bitcoin then you will see the next phase of Bitcoin revolution with thriving .bit domains.   
I suggest you to HODL as much as you can NMC and set your .bit domains from now and just wait.

Yeah I think those banks that now will adopt/use bitcoin in a matter of lending bitcoins will be the winners later. This is exactly like the internet and telcos at the beginning. Who was adapting to new technologies was the ones that win at the end. Who was blaming internet, they just disappear.   
I see that kiva.org is quite well seen on internet but they don't accept bitcoin yet. Their system is quite very well with verification and also their agents in the field.   
Yeah we need some trusted platform but most important is to have a system that verify the scams....
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:27:22
Again Andreas say it:  
"In many countries around the world, if a government bans bitcoin it will instantly be more credible as an alternative choice."  
"The Internet at first was controversial, geeky and very strongly resisted by governments and telcos. Repeating history with bitcoin"  
"Bitcoin’s success is owed to creativity and innovation. It has nothing to do with the government’s endorsement"  
"Countries rejecting bitcoin reminds me of the time when countries were resisting the Internet."  
"Bitcoin is global, decentralized and unstoppable. Let govt try, it will be hilarious to watch."

I will mention some wonderful quotes (you know who is...)  
  Bitcoin (with capital B) is a Network, not a coin.  
  bitcoin (with small caps) is the coin.  
  Read the Satoshi's papers and you will understand the difference.  
  There are thousands of pages written about bitcoin. None of them spell it BitCoin. Therefore you have read none of them if you spell it thus.  
  People who say that bitcoin is not or cannot become a “valid currency” are ignoring the simple, demonstrable fact that it already is. Just need a bit more time to be well established.
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:09:18
Please don't agree with me. Is my point of view for all this "drama".   
You will see more and more "drama" from now on for this case, just to hide the real truth - gov created this "honey pot" to for the flies.  
But their intention wasn't to catch the drunk flies that sell/buy drogs on SK, but to discredit the whole bitcoin idea, to associate it with bad guys, bad behaviour, mafia etc...  
Just investigate for yourself, ask more questions, talk with your friends, make them to wake up. And don't listen the troll from this sub. There are a lot, there is an army paid by NSA.

Yes sure but as I said, we don't need/want a preacher, we want a teacher. A teacher can be Andreas or any other person that the capabilities to explain in well.  
Also I don't like that for now we have only one predominant voice, Andreas. Should be more speeches from many others, that bring this passion, truth and force that is coming from Andreas. And also should be in many other languages, for example I don't see anyone having speeches about bitcoin in Spanish...

This is amazing! This great idea should have more support from the bitcoin community. Every bitcoiner will donate to support the project when will really understand the advantages.  
If later will be maintenance costs for these sats, also we can have let's say 1 satoshi per each TX to go to maintain these sats.
