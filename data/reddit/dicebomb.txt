You see, there is a difference. In order for your example to be applicable, we'll have to make a few adjustments.
Go watch a homeless guy jump through multiple hoops for no apparent reason at all. Now go watch a homeless guy jump through multiple hoops for no apparent reason at all and then watch as a little girl giggles and handles him a penny, while she says "thank you".
Your example uses a payment. There is a very distinct difference between a payment and a tip. I tip because I want to, and because someone made something memorable. I pay because I recieved a service that I asked for.

He miswrote [porre]( which is Danish for  leek. He's actually implying that a leek has the ability to spit on someones face, which is pretty cool I guess.

Wouldn't it be even more insulting not to tip at all then? Even 1 Doge is infinitely more than nothing. That must mean that you value their time infinitely more than if you don't tip at all.

And the worst part is that you get more money for being unemployed than you do for studying.  
"We're going to be the smartest" the government said. "And that's why it's more beneficial not to take a free masters degree or something else."

heh..  
Shit aside, they're not really that popular here in Denmark (mostly due to the "we gotta give people that doesn't work more money than those who study". With taxes like this, I understand some money going to those who study, but definitely not less than those who do not work)
