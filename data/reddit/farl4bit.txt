Instead of keeping the old cow alive, switch over to the second generation of cryptocurrencies. There are a lot of cool PoS currencies already. Such as Nxt, great stuff is going on there!

This is why Nxt is so exciting! Bitcoin and other clones of Bitcoin are kind of boring, it's just a currency with a few extra features. Nxt is creating a platform for a future digital economy of maybe the Nxt internet? Don't know, a lot of development is happing, I can't keep track of it. Great times!

But it could be a better success than Bitcoin, because of the great features and uncountable possibilities.

Nxt is easy to use and has the most potential now. You must try it! Good luck with the business! :)

Nice to see a lot of development in Nxt! That's what I like about Nxt, there is so much going on.

Nice article and a good readable and easy to understand summary of what the community of Nxt is capable of. I have a lot of trust in Nxt, the brightest and smartest people are working hard on Nxt all the time. There are a lot of new revolutionary projects on the way. Definitely a better Bitcoin IMHO.

Great job, but unfortunately Nxt will launch it Asset Exchange (colored coins) earlier.

There were given big bounties to dev's who found bugs (someone got 10BTC) and the 3 bugs that where placed in the code! In Nxt everyone can help and earn bounties. Please test Nxt too!
