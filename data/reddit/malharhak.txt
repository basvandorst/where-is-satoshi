You're right, I didn't realize this question could be generalized to peer to peer connections in general, thanks.

I wouldn't call linking a website I posted here months ago spam, but well.
Anyway, it's not about traffic, I'm just curious to see what people think of it. This website doesn't earn me any money, I just want to know if the time spent on it was useful to people here or not.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:00:32
Always like that on reddit, especially this subreddit. I shouldn't have forgotten that the internet is full of frustrated agressive people...
@_date: 2014-12-10 02:22:40
Ok so you still need to somehow know at least one working peer's address.
I was wondering if there was some sort of way to automatically "discover" peers, but that didn't seem possible which is why I was asking
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:48:00
I'm just curious if it is actually possible without setting up wires, because I always figured that bitcoins are simple and everything, but when I sent these bitcoins I wondered how to actually get the dollars from them, and realized that it's really complicated.
So, I made a thread here to see if there isn't any easy option I was not aware of (that I could then explain to the guy yes, but that's another story).
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:37:07
1) As I said, it is a listing of websites accepting Bitcoins, so that if you want to buy stuff with bitcoins you can find a place to do so.
2) Well why would they be? Everything can be faked everywhere I don't see what the point is

Oh that's an interesting point. Anyway it's sad, people here seem to be more and more negative as time pass. The downvotes are crazy here, not only for my post but in general :(
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:11:44
Well even with that, I don't think the real value behind bitcoin is the fact that you can trade them for money. In the end, the real reason why people will buy them is because they are an alternative to current ways of spending/receiving money. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:49:07
if you use cents to pay, do you have to look up how much $ they are?
Or if a length is in cm, do you need to check how much meters it is ?
It's just that you're used to see bitcoins, that doesn't mean it's a good unit. converting to mBTC is just a matter of shifting the zeros

From what I've read it would be possible with a viable computer to crack some part of the bitcoin crypto (private key stuff), and I didn't see any proof of the opposite yet. So my concern was about this part of the thing, and how close we would be of getting near it, considering we're now speaking of 512 qubit computers instead of only ~10 (even if the google one isn't exactly a pure quantum computer, it is still big).
Now someone has answered that the bitcoin protocol can change, which is the answers to most possible problems and an answer I didn't see anywhere else.
And no I don't spend a day reading everything I can find on the web before asking a question, I just read a few things and ask, that's what questions are for.
Oh and you know, maths do change. Especially in so much advanced fields. There are a lot of maths problems that are yet to be solved/proved which could actually change a lot of things. For exemple there are some cryptographic systems we haven't proven yet if they are crackable or not, and at what difficulty. So, yea, things can change even for that.
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:02:06
Little precision : My question is more meant for groups of people (or communities) than individuals. Like for exemple presenting bitcoins to the users of a forum, things like that.

You made me curious. Does the fact of providing escrow involves personnal informations disclosure ? Or can it be done totally anonymously ? That seems interesting.

This is obviously an enormous fake. Just the time a computer needs to *count* the number of wallets is irrealistic, so cracking them ? Impossible.

When I initially saw the image, I thought of a market manipulation too. Then seeing everyone on reddit I thought there was a confirmation somewhere.
But it's true, didn't see any official statement... If this is a market manipulation this was a huge hit... Better hope it's not
Edit : The only confirmation was from a twitter account speaking about its lawyers, but that doesn't seem really official to me..
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:16:59
Well, mtgox just killed itself, seems it agreed with me.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:18:29
Well let's assume it's purely technical/banking issues (which honestly for a platform so big shouldn't exist, it's their only job), why can't we see anything written in big red letters on the website that says like "We are currently on the process of upgrading our infrastructure/getting stuff done with banks, in the meanwhile you should be warned that you just won't get any money from us" ?
Having problems is fine, hiding them is a whole other story which drives suspicion.

Yes, it's like they were asleep for two years and a fraction of them is waking up each day.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:21:19
Yes but the problem is that it is really hard to explain the value of bitcoin and convince people that it is a real value. Because of that, people think it is a virtual value, and associate it with scams like the Ponzi scheme.
So I guess to prove that it's not a ponzi scheme you have to prove the value first, but that is difficult to explain to most people.
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:29:33
Yes of course. I'm just curious of the general "mood" about it.

At the beginning there was no lag (which actually surprised me) so I took advantage of the crash and did a few buy/sells, not panic selling. That went good. But suddenly, at the big up spike, there was an enormous lag and at that my order was not cancelled because of the lag and I lost everything I won + a little bit more :(
So yea, not gonna trade at those times anymore.
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:32:34
Well I want to buy even as this price, I just think it is very possible that in a few days the price go back a little lower and I can get more bitcoins, considering the big rise.
I wanted to buy a week ago, but mtgox was very long to process my wire and now the price is really high :(
@_date: 2013-10-20 15:47:42
Well it is true, banks and stuff will change their algorithm, but aren't bitcoins based on a fixed protocol ? I thought the bitcoin's protocol couldn't be changed, which is the reason of this concern. But if it can evolve then I suppose there's no problem.
Thanks for this answer :)

Well I'm actually trying to get off mtgox, but in the meantime i'm still using their prices as reference.
If anyone knows a good bitcoin broker for Europeans btw...
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:12:08
Well I have only a few BTCs (less than 10) so I hope it won't be too hard to do... But I think I will directly transfer the BTCs to a wallet. It means losing the pretty big arbitrage difference between mtgox and other platforms (which is arround $30 these days I think) but it's better than staying in here.
I really think there is something fishy around here. I know sometimes people are not happy about a service, but I'm reading everywhere stories of people who can't withdraw money from mtgox, I even saw some who couldn't withdraw pure bitcoins either !
This subject should get more attention. Maybe getting a sort of testimony website or something to see if it is really isolated technical issues or if mtgox is totally playing with their clients...
Thanks for your answer anyway :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:05:53
Probably... I backed them on kickstarter, received it, saw the poor games, poor interface, numerous bugs and overall unfinished thing. Never played it again.
But this made me remind it, and now that time passed they should have fixed most problems and maybe some developers made great games. I'll try to put it back on to see...
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:26:48
I never said it wasn't, I said we may think of better ideas.

@_date: 2013-11-19 01:27:48
We're probably in a little bubble, but people are hearing about bitcoins right now, and they all want it, which will probably make it stay high/go higher. With the US senat stuff and all the media coverage bitcoin is getting/gonna get..

I always use limit orders, who doesn't ?
But really, it went so fast and with so much lag, the only thing I could do is place an order $60 higher than the trading price to counter the lag.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:52:52
There's delay and delay. I don't mind a few seconds lag, but when it gets to the minutes... It's just really frustrating to lose ~10% on mtgox's technical problems. I mean, it is an issue, considering there are more people trading bitcoins each day, if the platforms can't process everything in a reasonable time...
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:52:54
Exactly, but I  don't know the best way to visualize all the bitcoin's awesomness.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:15:10
Why do I get so much downvotes for asking a simple question ?  I'm seriously wondering why so much downvotes are coming without explanation on legitimate questions like this. Is it just a sort of "oh don't start criticizing my beloved mtgox" ?

That was mostly my plan from what I've read, but I'm still wondering, what exactly do I need to backup so my wallet stay usable?
Say, for example I got a wallet. I backup the file on a USB key or something, and then on my main computer I spend some bitcoins.
Then I lose this wallet, so I take the backup from my USB key, which was before I spent my bitcoins. Doesn't that cause a problem, considering the wallet doesn't have every transaction data?
And if I wanted to make a paper copy, what data do I need to restore a wallet later? Just the private key?
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:44:28
SR gets taken down and the whole market gets in panic... We will still need time for the bitcoin to become a less risky money.
Anyway I still think bitcoin have a great value, not to sell drugs but for the amazing things it makes possible. The prices will rise again in a few hours/days :)
I'm actually sad I don't have any money on my mtgox account right now, I think it's really a great great time to buy cheap.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:46:26
Man that's really an awesome post.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:18:07
No I prefer sleeping with BTC (I have trust it'll keep getting up in the end so I don't mind if it goes to $800 overnight). Thing is, The price just got stucked to 12XX and I didn't expect that, so I'd like to wait before buying back.
But I'm affraid of one of these night during which bitcoin just goes $200 higher... So I need something to alert me in case that sort of thing happens.
Thanks for btcreport, I'll check it
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:15:45

@_date: 2013-11-21 22:05:39
That's really sad... I just registered on their website and wanted to use my bitcoin gains to pledge a big amount (like $500) but they don't support it and it seems people don't want to.
In the end, they don't get money because I don't have spare dollars available at the moment to pledge the game..
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:19:12
I think the "stable" price right now should be arround $160
I've just sold my coins at the 192 mark, waiting for it to go back down and buy them again (I want to keep them, but not during these sort of big bubbles)
But I don't know. Given the huge increasing in bitcoin's popularity, maybe this just reflects high demand (in which case I should buy my bitcoins back soon)
Anyway if I see it stays too long arround 180/190 I'll buy them back at this price, otherwise I'll wait for it to fall back to regular price.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:25:42

@_date: 2013-12-06 20:33:49
I calculated it a few days ago so I don't remember very well, but:
I looked at their daily trading volume, which I don't remember the value so let's redo the math with today's volume. I see currently written : 43,360 BTC. That is, considering a 1,000 USD/BTC value 43,360,000 USD of trading volume.
Gox takes 0.55% fees. So 43,360,000 * 0.0055 is the amount of USD they gain each day: $238,480. And the day is not finished.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:41:00
Mtgox is processing millions of $s of transactions each day, making them earn really a big lot of money, but they can't support load without 2 minutes lag, seriously? Servers don't cost that much
Don't say it's our fault if mtgox lags. It's their fault
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:59:17
It doesn't matter that I won or lose, the thing is there are many people that have a lot of bitcoins on mtgox, and this kind of bugs shouldn't be there because you can't just let people lose that much money because of technical problems. They're not selling breads, they're managing millions of dollars, and earning a lot of money from that.
So, the service should at least work correctly.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:20:27
Oh right I forgot that... Well I'll use that to get back what I lost then. No fees is like a cheat code
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:00:08
Everything you said is wrong, even the "Quick question" part. Go read stuff about bitcoins.
1) The value of bitcoins is in the transactions it makes possible
2) It's an open source protocol desgined by a person but implemented and accepted by many, based on a peer to peer network
3) Bitcoins are generated by a fixed algorithm, depending on the entire network (more powerfull than any supercomputer on earth, so totally uncrackable), which finite quantities.
4) They are a legitimate money, used for legitimate reasons. The silk road stuff made a lot of noise but silk road is gone, bitcoin's still there.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:57:40
It's not just that, it's just that most of the thing people buy cost 0.XXX BTCs, meaning that the unit is just not adapted at all to usual purchases.
If you pay at the restaurant in bitcoin and have to pay $20, you'd pay something like 0.05 BTCs. And to do the maths you'd need to remember a dollar is worth 0.0026 BTC. So say the restaurant show prices in BTCs, you have to do the maths on values that are two digits after the zero...
On the other hand with mBTC, still at the current price :
Now 1 mBTC would be worth ~$3. Not too hard to remember, nor to use. To calculate my launch I'd just multiply the mBTC price by 3. Easy

A broker is a broker. From a technical point of view, the trading inside mtgox doesn't depend on bitcoin, but only on their ability to make a robust exchange system. It's just a matter of transfering numbers from users to users, in an efficient way. Of course it is complicated, but considering they got a few millions per months, they sure can hire people able to manage that.
It's not that hard.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:15:03
Tech is not that important. Great games can happen anywhere. 
I think the biggest problem here is the fact that a cheap console running on a phone OS was associated with cheap mobile games like angry bird, and so no company would make a "real" console game, and no real gamer would buy it either

@_date: 2013-12-09 20:55:00
Yes but they would have to find a way to get bitcoins (how? Opening an account at mtgox or something?) and buy them (then they have to justify this expense to the taxes), and then give them back to me
@_date: 2013-10-19 12:09:03
Well this was the initial plan, back when bitcoins were created, that in the end we are gonna use semantics like mBTC or even µBTC
Considering the current value of BTCs being always more than $100, I think this would definitely a good time to start speaking of mBTC

Just today they processed 66k btcs, which is ~66 millions, so they received at least $300,000 in trading fees.

Oh. Thanks for the info then
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:38:54
No, it's just that an ordered I cancelled like 3 minutes ago was executed out of nowhere, selling my bitcoins at something like 850. When I noticed, I wanted to buy them back, placed an order at around 880, but it was pending for 30 seconds, then the price went to 9XX, and each time I tried to place an order it was just pending for way too much time.
So I directly placed an order at something like 980 (which is the current price it seems) to be sure I could get back my bitcoins, but in the process I lost a lot.
@_date: 2013-10-19 11:06:01
I don't think it really changes anything. Well, what changes is the variation of price after you mine. So let's say you mine a block, and then the price gets up you get profit. But starting to mine after a price rise is just nonsense.
Well, except for the fact that anyway bitcoins will be rising for a long time and that bitcoin surely will have more value in the future than they have now.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:09:07
I don't care about getting downvotes/upvotes, but it's a mirror of the community. I feel there is a lot of people here who are not welcoming at all, not accepting newbies and being very elitist. And that's a shame
And I don't think that's some sort of manipulation thing, or they're very stupid to think they can manipulate the market by downvoting stuf...
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:59:26
Well of course that's just my opinion. But as it's started to fall and is more stable, I think people who wanted to get bitcoins will get this occasion so the price is pretty much going to rise now. Maybe not as highg as before, but probably higher than it is now.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:04:10
I once read an interview about a guy who was doing just that, and there was a website for that.
Don't remember the name, but search terms like "local bitcoins" or something...
Edit : These were in person trading. Trading bitcoin over paypal is another story. Due to scam stuff, it would be hard to find.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:22:38
Well you're right then. And yes I understand downvoting the many posts we can see each time bitcoins are going a little bit high. But still, there are a lot of downvotes here, especially when people ask questions, that seem like overrreacting

But maybe I should have waited 6 months to show the updated version? ...
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:58:03
+1 on that question. I've been looking for informations about cold storage but didn't found much satisfying things.
How do you guys here store your bitcoins for a long term secure goal ?
I mean, I've heard of printing private keys, backuping wallets on dropbox and all sort of stuff, but I'm not really aware of how wallets really work in the first place so...
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:41:47
Yes that's mostly for time and mental health that I like this idea, otherwise I think I'm gonna stare at the price for the week...
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:43:15
I canceled it in time. *Mtgox* couldn't process my cancel in time.
See the difference? My choice vs mtgox lag = mtgox makes bad choices for me
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:53:09
Oh that looks nice. Plus there's some DotA 2 in it :D
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:54:19
I was getting to bed when the ride started. Now I'm stuck.
But I think the price is safe for now, until some timezone wakes up and gets all "omagad gotta buy/sell ermazrhzeo"
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:21:39
Well until now getting bitcoins out *in coins form* worked ok. It's the USD withdrawals that get complicated.
Thing is, considering how their engine is getting these days I'm wondering if it is still the case.
@_date: 2013-10-20 15:02:29
Well my point was just discussing, all the discussions found seemed old and so don't take into account last news/breakthrough, that why I was curious to see what people have to say about it
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:35:49
That seems great. I'll look if I see more informations about them but zero fee is cool
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:33:58
Well, considering everyone has his wire ready, as soon as the correction will happen it'll go back up. Which means... No correction
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:24:14
Coming in the update :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:46:19
The $1,000 milestone of course. Or whatever crazy thing that may happen tonight, considering how the price is evolving
@_date: 2013-08-01 15:16:37
Do you know where I can reach him ? Thank you for your answers !
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:01:39
Do they manage to keep the lag at a reasonable value on times like this ? If they do I'll definitely switch.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:40:33
That's true when you want to sell a service, a big website. But there are often people that create mini website in a few hours/days just for fun or something, and people like that.
In my case, I wanted to make a first working version really quick. So yes it's not extremely beautiful but it does the job. Then I'll try to make it look better.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:48:45
But who/what has the authority to make such changes ? Is it only the software's creators that decide what they do, and then transactions happen between softwares using the same algorithm ? It seems hard to coordinate
@_date: 2013-08-01 13:25:29
Were these transaction very small, or more like mine ?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:46:58
Which money ? It's free to use, unless I'm missing something
Edit : Ok I see what you mean. Never noticed that. It seems really great. If you're one of the guys that speculate on short term bitcoin moves, with all those bear traps that are happening, a strong real-time trading tool could be extremely efficient for quick sell/buy.
If you just hold your coins and buy/sell them some day at a certain point, I don't think it has any use.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:52:37
lag accelerates crash because it makes people panic more.
The fact that all major exchanges are linked is due to arbitrage. 
Anyway that's not the point. During these periods there are too much transactions and so mtgox lag. This is not "perceived" nor "imagined" this is a fact, and the value of the latency is written at the bottom of most tickers.
Due to this lag, you can't place any order, or you risk to lose a lot of money due to the price change between the moment you enter your order and the moment it is processed.
Doesn't april lag crash remind you something ?
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:57:11
Exact. I didn't try on a big screen but it looks like a static page. I will add another row then
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:08:29
But don't buy right now (in case you are going to) the market is going crazy right now, and you could be caught on the wrong side of a bubble
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:54:52
That. Mostly.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:45:43
Don't know. I just think that random market excitement due to bear-trappers has made mtgox crash and it now have a few minutes lag. Perfect recipe for a quick crash.
But as soon as people will calm down, the price will probably continue to rise back...
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:40:59
Oh I didn't know about this bot, it's funny :D
But it made me want to buy actually
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:59:01
Well I think you bought just at the right time, because the prices will surely rise. Personally, I think I will hold these coins for long term, because this money being fixed in amount, if it becomes really usefull (and it's starting to be, there are a lot of services adding bitcoin payments) their value will rise to space
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:20:01
That's why I said my idea is impossible. It was an example of how the creation of the money could be more fair.
I don't have a viable solution on my mind, I just think that maybe someone can think of something.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:34:51
Well that's true. But for me it meant that most people didn't even bother clicking so...
And yes about bitcoinblackfriday I thought that their website is nice so I based mine on the same sort of layout. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:15:19
It's a big problem, that the only way to get bitcoins is through this complicated verification process..
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:30:32
Thanks :)
And yea, I don't really know how to make good responsive stuff, so I didn't really try.  I just grabbed bootstrap and made stuff work.
But any help is welcome for that, yea.
Edit: Loaded the website on my iPhone, that was funny
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:00:57
Well if you place an order at this price, as long you don't cancel it it will stay up, so you should be able to do that on any bitcoin broker.
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:08:44
That's probably the best answer here, but still the problem of people accepting that bitcoins are a real thing with a value.
You know, when I speak with, say my parents, of bitcoins, they always answer like "stay away from these virtual things this is fake" while I show them the few k$ I earned. Many people react like that when presented a concept different from what they usually know
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:22:53
Hey I went on your website, but then I clicked on the about link or something like that and now the website won't load. No 404 or anything, just my browser not finding the domain at all :(
Anyway that seems great, I've got a lot of people that would like to read it !
@_date: 2013-10-25 12:14:08
What do you mean by "cold storage" ? Stocking a wallet on a USB key or something like that ?
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:07:13
Lag. Massive lag, so everyone gets excited, so more lag, etc etc
Or DDOS maybe, who knows
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:53:22
There's a lot of problems with responsiveness. I didn't really try on other browser size than mine (which is stupid I know) that's what I'll be working on first.
So thanks for that :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:52:01
omg I laughed so much
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:33:04
Oh that's actually a nice idea
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:47:03
Well that's what upvotes are for. Upvoting makes the good content stay at the top, but downvoting on the other hand, is meant for things that really don't belong here I think. Not really sure if there's any "official" statement about when we should use up/downvotes though
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:59:38
Oh thanks! That's my first tip, I'm so excited to accept it :D
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:36:35
Key word : "I think".
It's because back then only geek (or at least tech enthusiasts) were aware of bitcoins. Now, many people that are not especially technical become aware of it, so I think that what happened with bitcoins previously was not really relevant because it concerned only an extremely small fraction of the bitcoins users.
Edit: And if you took "pure" values, you would just get less transaction volume, which would mean an even higher value for bitcoins. so...
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:07:23
You can withdraw of course, otherwise the bitcoins wouldn't be yours and this website would be an enormous scam
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:50:41
Totally agree. I don't see the point of blocking bitcoin on iOS. I mean, it's not a threat to them at all. Me using bitcoins doesn't mean I'll stop buying apps in USD...
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:19:04
Sure, I agree with that. But it still made a minority of people rich
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:06:50
I mean the big latency that mtgox is under as soon as there are a bit of people there and that makes the price crash like just happened.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:29:41
wow, these prices seem years ago to me
@_date: 2013-10-19 12:36:47
So why are people staying in there ? Now that I've heard of this I just want to GTFO of this platform before something bad happens.
I mean, letting a currency virtually sky rocketting its value while not having the money to repay it ? I'm not especially educated about finances, but it seems like a really bad idea...
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:13:01
Back in the days, I mined like 3/4 bitcoins in pool mining, but they weren't worth much, so I ended up forgetting them, and the computer on which they were was reinstalled.
Well, fuck.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:37:01
Well, at least more people are gonna buy bitcoins with that, depending on what the movie say... Will they even explain what a bitcoin is ?
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:37:36
Let's hope the april reddit lag will not happen again :(
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:55:58
Is mining still viable for little setups these days ? It seems that the profit for mining is now so little that only big setups (like mining pools or rich people who can build sort of supercomputers) really have a chance of being profitable.
No ?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:26:13
True. It's been a long time since I wanted to do that. Thing is, I don't know other brokers, I don't know if they accept wires from my bank (I'm in France), and I made myself a trading tool using the mtgox API.
So, I'm not really happy to get out of it. But I just lost way too much bitcoins due to their lag to stay there. And I can't even ask for a refund, because they're "not reponsible" for their bugs...
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:11:34
Well, I'd advice you to keep them, like, long term. Bitcoins won't be falling today.
They can go back low, for a few days, but then they'll rise back.
anyway with the chinese being in berzerk mode about bitcoins, I think they won't get low for the coming days anyway. But seriously bitcoins are awesome, keep them
