Reminder: Store large amounts of crypto in Cold Wallets! Ledger or Trezor does the trick too. But not an exchange or hot wallet.

Another reminder to investors not to put your coins in an exchange if possible!

There are two likely scenarios IMO.
1) As the economy crashes, so does the entire cryptocurrency industry. Economies are tied together and if one sector falls into a crisis, others will follow suit as people scramble to sell their assets/investments to pay bills (at this point, crypto is just used for speculation).
2) Economic crisis once again points to the issues of the banking system and the crash leads people to search for safety in other industries/countries. Bitcoin/Crypto serves as a good alternative investment and does well as a store of value (similar to how people turn to Gold during a crisis).

It's good to see people building up habits of saving and investing because of crypto.

Who cares. That's like saying the world will have a social network but it won't be MySpace. 
Well, some form of Bitcoin or better cryptocurrency will eventually become mainstream. But it's not going to be your bank integrated with "blockchain technology".

If some of the new technologies such as sharding, sidechains or scaling networks work out, might not need to worry about this

That's like saying old people will use email since that's how their employers will communicate with them. Habits are hard to change and new technologies may be hard to use for some people. Maybe Bitcoin pensions will be an option, but maybe some people just won't take that option.

I don't think Bitcoin will completely replace cash. Just like how email didn't completely replace written mail, some people will continue to be comfortable with cash (maybe the older generation).
However, will Bitcoin have a massive impact on certain parts of the world? I believe so. Whether it's for the store of value or transactions, as long as Bitcoin keeps improving its code, we will see that become a reality.

If you believe in Bitcoin, why wait for it to "dip". In the long run, it won't matter if it was a dip or not if crypto goes mainstream.

Markets are all driven by FUD and hype these days. Just HODL

Check out localbitcoins.com or register with an online exchange if you are looking to liquidate.

New revolutionary technologies will always face backlash from the existing communities. But eventually, they will prevail.

Although money is part of it, I do believe that there is a group of people who are still trying to make Bitcoin/crypto a part of society for the benefit of people.

Breaking 10k is gonna lead to more than just memes. Will probably start seeing some major news headlines soon too

Hey, just a thought. Is it possible to also include the size of the mempool in these stats so we have an idea if lots of transactions are pending? Thanks!

I mean, how many people really understands how the Internet works even today. We just know what we can do with it
