Could someone clear this up for me please?
Let's say I'm somewhere far, far out there on the interwebs and come across a lone website whose author wrote some stuff I liked. I have no idea if they're even conscious of the word bitcoin but I decide to send them a bitcoin tip, say $20 bucks. Or whatever. 
What's the process? What happens when I do it? How will they know something happened or they have money coming/waiting? I get the point of changetip and love it, signed up immediately and figured I'd get the learning second! Is there anything not to do with changetip when sending anonymous strangers tips in bitcoin on the net? 
For that matter, how anonymous is it for us both?
Thanks if anyone answers :)

Thank you :) I'm still getting the hang of Reddit and still not sure how to set up alerts/notifications if available...so I didn't see this earlier.
I do appreciate it though :)

I've seen this same post on bitcointalk forums...I bet it's the same guy.

I'm new to reddit - not bitcoin...and hate that because it's asking all the dumb questions ;-p I learned about the changetip about an hour ago, signed up, sent $10 bucks to the wallet...but the sending and receiving (not that anyone's sending me a tip) and the monikers - I'm a little lost. 
I like the Tip Tuesday idea though, for whatever that's worth. 
Where can I go to learn the changetip ropes for reddit and other places?

Still trying to figure out how to do this and what I type specifically. 
What's the right syntax to send to someone specific?
How do you claim tips? Someone tipped me and there's a notice to claim in 7 days...no idea where or how to do that.

Would there be a way to do it where it's like the up/down votes or karma, and instead of a post, the user or thread has a little bar where people say thanks/tips. The one that comes to mind is like on the warrior forums, when people send thanks, they're all listed in a little section below comments. 
If there's an icon next to the name or post, it could open a little js window with the info in it, or a hover tool tip, and stays off the main board?
Just thinking out loud. I'm new to reddit but figure why not jump right in and get involved :)
