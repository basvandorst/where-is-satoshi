I'm going to wonder how the blockchain size will inflate in the next 6 months then...

Sent a transaction 2 days ago, with 30 dollars fee. Stuck in the void.    
Sent a transaction 2 hours ago, with 130 dollars fee (HUNDRED THIRTY, YES). Stuck in the void.    
BITCOIN IS DEAD. DEAL WITH IT.    
Move onto better technologies like IOTA or Byteball.    
And no, BCH is not a solution: when the userbase will increase by 8x we will be back at the same point.    
You think 8x increase in userbase is a lot? It's not. We are already probably around 2 times what Bitcoin can tolerate, something like 12 TPS.    
Wonder why so many exchanges do NOT allow the creation of new accounts? What would happen if Coinbase and Bitfinex would allow another 50000 new clients to buy Bitcoin EVERY DAMN DAY?    
You guess it: Bitcoin would be dead in one month.    
Bitcoin is DEAD, it's fokkin DEAD, and BCH is not a solution, it's just a palliative.

I am the writer of that article.
I am one of the new writers after the old staff was fired.
I am not responsible for the firing of the old staff.
I already received free insults from a couple of idiots in another article, about Craig Wright. Probably resentful fired writers. That article was covered by the whole world, not too differently from how I covered it: with doubts about Craig Wright being Satoshi Nakamoto. On top of that, two of the most important tech websites, Gizmodo and Wired, were the first to report the thing, claiming they FOUND Satoshi Nakamoto. But I guess some idiot here didn't go there and insult the authors, right? :)
1) CT received an email from alleged Satoshi Nakamoto.
2) It's written explicitly in there, that in the beginning we had a laugh about it, because of course we don't expect a common email coming from Satoshi Nakamoto without any proof.
3) You may like the article or not (nobody in this world has ever written done anything appreciated by EVERYBODY, and I surely don't expect to manage in this mission), but the NEWS is that we received that email, and thus we published it with due critics.
4) I also managed to add an interview to the most obvious person involved: founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin.
5) "No proof provided whatsoever". Either you didn't read the article and stopped at the title, or you have serious mental problems. I don't give any proof that the email is from Satoshi, because I have no proof about it. I EXAMINED the email and exposed that it is very easily a fake. It's all written in there, you can go back and read it.
6) From the topic starter website: "Filled with typos, absolutely clownish. This writer of the article should be fired for trying to do such a stupid thing." 
I didn't "try to do such a stupid thing." The articles are reviewed by the chief editor and other people at CoinTelegraph, I didn't "try" to do anything. I wrote an article, it was approved and published.
The only clownish person here is you, evidently vomiting hate for some reason (maybe you are a former CT writer? There's good chances). 
7) Those typos are not mine: they are in the original email, and as you can see if you are not blind or completely stupid, there's a snapshot of it: it's not text. I don't correct something I am going to examine, and in the article those grammar errors were taken as proof as well. You clearly can't even understand something so simple like this.
8) I don't know past history of CoinTelegraph, I sometimes read it before joining the staff, but since I write for them, I didn't see a single article about HitBTC or Bytecoin.
9) The writer of this post could much be the same one that sent the email, as well as one of the former writers is a good option to consider. There's much hate going on around here.
10) Don't bother mocking me more here: I don't give a flying **** and I won't answer back again. Stupid is stupid and I have no time or wish or hope to make somebody more clever than what he is. You either can understand what the article is: a teasing of the email with included interview, or you can't. But I give you another hint, the picture is one my idea: it represents a fired writer, a clown, that has just sent CT that email. Guess nobody here could catch that :)
11) Last but not least: I don't read magazines and newspapers that I don't like. I save my time for something better :) that's another clever choice somebody could adopt :)
Have a fantastic Christmas everyone! :)

Btw, just noticed that ALL the poor posters here below have [score hidden]. What is this? Ashamed of being peed on your head by everybody? Poor frustrated losers. And with this I really close here, bb.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:56:09
Where do you read that I expect to gain readership?
Also, I don't expect to gain readership by licking around: if a shit attacks me and writes stupid bullshit, I will expose him for what he is.
Compliments for your post, very clever and productive :)
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:11:23
You see, I am NOT CoinTelegraph. 
If you don't like my articles, don't read them. 
I am commenting MY article, because I was attacked personally. 
This wasn't an attack to CT, it was an attack to me. 
Even though you probably hate CT for the fact that it has fired the old staff. 
But you are attacking ME, here. 
What I see here is a bunch of frustrated aggressive kids that instead taking the article for what it is (as I explained in my post, but you still seem to not accept how I developed the article, but that's your problem) have pleasure in insulting and attacking. 
Well, for my point of view people like you can go to hell. 
No, really, don't read my articles. 
I don't want to WIN readers. 
That article is what I can do. If you don't like it, I'm sorry. Don't read it. Don't waste your time. I am not at your level. There's much competition around, read the other newspapers. I am sure you won't miss CoinTelegraph. Especially my articles :)
Oh and last but not least, have I answered to you personally? I don't think so. But it seems that for some reason you take it personally. So either you are the author of the hoax email or of the attack to me, or you have some mental problem, because nowhere I replied to any your post, ever.

Those Ethereum douchebags have the second highest volume of exchange after Bitcoin. Guess who needs attention here is somebody else (i.e.: all the remaining altcoins).

Hello, is it possible to send NO FEE when sending bitcoins?
Not that I don't want to reward somebody but if I need to test something I would like to not pay a fee on it...
Also, the fee on kryptokit seems a bit high to me: 0.001 is now half a dollar... if you keep on having these transaction fees then bitcoin would never be used for microtransactions in games, in example.
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:52:57
And the channel system is rooted in the newmade Bitcoin protocol, so that if the sender hacks the software and re-spend the funds, only the first transaction will be valid?    
Thanks for explanation, btw :)
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:41:54
The problem is: until the transaction is broadcasted, it has no validation. Am I wrong?
This means the person that sent BTC could send the same BTC to someone else before the first recipient broadcasts its transaction? Wrong?
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:16:47
Say it! Just... SAY IT!    
BITCOIN IS DEAD!    
LOL    
    
You clearly understand nothing of money AND Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:28:20
Well let's hope they also wasted some money with their attitude: that way the lesson would be better learned :D    
However one must be a bit stupid to believe an increase of 0.3% per day would jump to a 5% per day.
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:42:47
Well I think the same of you :)
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:11:47
Seems like Satoshi had his good reasons to remain anonymous...
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:15:02
Not all altcoins are the same.    
Some have more chances to stay than others, and thus it makes sense to add them to a platform.    
So what the hell are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:12:00
Actually, you can put lipstick on a honey badger, but only after she's dead.
@_date: 2016-11-21 07:25:25
Doesn't make any sense. If you mean attack, like to stop mining, that wouldn't affect much the network. The Bitcoin network can run with few hundreds of nodes active. If you mean a 51% attack by joining more chinese miners, then the community would just roll back to an earlier status and fuck up with chinese miners altogether. Additionally the joined pools would be easily identified by the % used in the attack and by the addresses used, and they would lose all their credibility. Many people would probably also kick them in the face directly, because they would cause a fall in Bitcoin's value.
@_date: 2016-12-05 12:56:13
Too easy! XD
@_date: 2016-11-26 18:04:04
Of course I'm talking about the next transaction number crisis.    
If people get pissed waiting hours for transactions, miners will have to react.
@_date: 2016-11-21 13:59:08
It won't be activated probably until the next crisis, when people will get pissed off and miners will finally have to give freeway to the new technology... if Bitcoin's price falls, miners are screwed, so they will have to do it.
@_date: 2015-08-08 23:39:06
What if the driving license is stored, along with each and every of your documents, on a blockchain? :D
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:17:58
Totally agree. Bitcoin will become what the mass wants. This point is important. If, at the moment, Bitcoin can't manage to become a payment platform, it's just part of its history. At the moment Bitcoin is the best store of value on the planet. In 2018 it will also become the best payment platform on the planet. Just ignore ANY other fork: when LN will be up and running, the games will be done. Keep it smooth. Send to hell anyone so avid to be ready to destroy everything for his own wealth (Roger Ver).
@_date: 2015-08-08 23:41:02
Don't worry.
Just wait that Bitcoin comes out of its embryo state.
When these people trusting in Ripple that bought this crap from banks will see what Bitcoin is... and that it's completely free and detached from the bank system, they will move on.
Of course banks didn't give a fuck about your friend: they won't earn anything from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-01 22:42:20
Thank you for the answer, was wondering as well... I'll go for the cheaper, I only need it as a backup to put in the safety box :)
@_date: 2016-10-25 09:25:25
There you go, dude, everybody who knows people that use remittances should do like you.
@_date: 2016-10-25 11:30:04
You are not saying anything that I don't know. I wrote a book on Bitcoin.    
The fee for a 2$ transaction surely is not going to be 0.24$, EVER, if one doesn't want to give so much to miners for nothing.
@_date: 2016-10-25 10:41:46
Well I've written that I am just holding my BTC in there, right? ;)    
But I can spend 2$ for the sake of well being of the Bitcoin ecosystem.    
People with a lot of money should instead use Bitcoin daily to push adoption!
@_date: 2016-10-25 10:39:17
Uhh what do you mean with that? I should have paid the equivalent in BTC of 1.99$ but paid 0.003333 BTC that showed up as 2.24 immediately after the payment. My guess is that Bitpay looks at different exchange rates than the Bitcoin Wallet does, but come on: more than 10% difference???    
Steam still say I paid 1.99$, but my Bitcoin Wallet, the official one, says it was 2.24. That's quite bad imho.
@_date: 2016-10-25 09:53:16
Bitcoin will initially pair up with fiat money in some countries.    
Bitcoin will disrupt the central banking system, but that will take at least 15 years from now.    
Companies not adopting Bitcoin will keep paying banks stupid fees... ultimately, all companies want to avoid those fees. When Bitcoin will be widely used, only an idiot would want to keep paying those fees.

@_date: 2016-10-25 10:40:32
Well sure. I'm not debating here if Bitcoin is a good investment, I have great hopes for it and I already doubled the investment, so it's all ok. I'm wondering why I ended up paying more instead than less.    
If Bitpay and other exchanges end up taking more than banks, Bitcoin is going nowhere with these services.
@_date: 2016-10-25 11:31:23
0.00007945 BTC is the fee I paid.

So what? A sex offender shouldn't have a job?
He's not working in a children school or in a hospital, he's just writing news about cryptocurrencies from wherever he lives.
Or do you think he should die by starving instead?

Release is on December.
@_date: 2016-10-09 04:58:36
I completely agree. I have great hopes for Bitcoin to take over the world, and I also think there's good chances it will, but it's not sure at all yet. Nobody should put everything into Bitcoin, but everybody should put something on it. This would already boost it to Mars.
@_date: 2016-10-09 04:31:31
Every time some fiat will devaluate or crash, Bitcoin will go up somewhat. (British Pound recent drop is an example)    
Every time some bank will feel the freeze of the tempest they themselves planted, Bitcoin will go up. (Deutsche Bank is a recent example)    
Unless banks and governments will attack Bitcoin straightly, Bitcoin will float higher and higher on the farts coming from the old financial system :D
