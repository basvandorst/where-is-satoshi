Have a look at the chart at the end of 2013 and then look at the current graph with a similar timeframe, exact same pattern. These last couple months are a complete bubble. 
If it hasn't dropped &lt;40% from 16k in march I'll eat a shoe

Thank you.

yea but look at the current map of channels, 
look at south america, some dots are only connected to one other place.. that's a bottleneck ripe for exploitation in the form of high tariffs.

It could take off, it's hard to say because of coin bias 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:01:52
So at that point only people who can afford to run nodes will, at which point nodes running in 3rd world countries will dwindle and power over those countries would dwindle, after all channels are the way to get services like a state paying for gas shipments or mining equipment.

In 2013 there was a correction, followed by a period of steadyness, then an up and then a down, then an up.. and then a large down

My mistake. I still will never understand why people buy those things

"btw you can't criticize society if you participate in it btw" like people living in the middle ages couldn't really complain about feudalism because they were a part of it tbh btw

I am 100% down for other coins trying to make a better coin but holy shit the anger over semantics is insane in Roger. Bcash = Bitcoin cash and vice versa  ffs, tell me if there is a difference in case I am making a fool of myself..

Wait wait so under what circumstances would be stop being cheap to run a node?

This is the original purpose of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:31:30
I just see a world where large corps have only one or two channels open with select hubs, the more money you have the easier it would be to get certain services.
I just see a world of expensive bottle necks that are sold and traded  between its biggest companies to vie for transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:13:54
DO you plan on upgrading to the new miners advertised for next year?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:23:24


What if the counter party refuses to accept the closure of the channel?


Has there been any thought put into who will run these hubs? It sounds like an org could set itself up as a hub and then start charging fees to use it. And at that point what you're describing is literally a bank, which is the opposite direction I thought bitcoin was going to head. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:48:56
I think the amount of power per transaction it takes is too much, I honestly don't see bitcoin in the picture 15 years from now
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:40:38
Seriously flawed argument there. People post on reddit because they hear about bitcoin and want to try it out only to get hit in the face with a larger fee than they were expecting.

The people who think the twins are holding 95%&lt; of the original stash are the same people who don't like newbies asking basic questions on here.

recovery method with 5 dollars? Why have a piece of tech that costs money to recover your coins?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:30:19
they are talking about an exchange deactivating the account of a customer with thousands of dollars on it, fuck off bot
