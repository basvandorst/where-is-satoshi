Good news.  They have fixed the problem and I made my first deposit to Bitstamp today.  Shame the price was given the chance to rise while I was waiting but oh well, can't have everything.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:35:48
In a twitter conversation with Bank of Scotland about this, they're suggesting Bitstamp has changed its code... they're wrong of course but I'm still battling.

For some reason, HBOS adds the XXX on the end, as detailed in the screenshot.

Worked for me, no need to divide balance.  Thanks for this, I was wanting a note of the exact figures I had in there.
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:09:42
Signed.  No one running a major Bitcoin business should be allowed on the foundation, whether they're considered competent or not.  The foundation should remain unbiased.
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:09:37
Thanks, will do.  If it's still happening later today, I shall give them a call (no email support by the looks of things but they do have phone support that's 24/7).

HA!  "We're aware of a problem with our international payment service, please try again later. Sorry for any inconvienience. ^DU"  I WIN!  I BEAT THE BANK!  ...still can't transfer but at least I made them confess that it's broken.

I had all my bitcoin in Gox... I know, I deserve everything I get :(
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:39:11
Yeah, for some reason, Bank of Scotland and Halifax adds XXX to the end of shorter codes like this (you can see in the screenshot it saying that it will do this).  It doesn't accept the code in either format :/

This screenshot from Bank of Scotland's online banking interface a few minutes ago.
Worth noting that Bank of Scotland and Halifax use identical interfaces that are just branded differently (to the extent that customers from both banks can log in to both sites using the same login details) so I imagine it appears on Halifax too.
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:40:13
I have been sending it without the XXX but it adds it on the end anyway, as is detailed in the screenshot.

I like this idea, I wonder if there is a universal pizza delivery gift card for Papa Johns/Pizza Hut/Dominos, i.e. a dominos gift card that works at dominos no matter what country you reside in.  If not, BTC donations may be the thing to do.  They deserve to know how much we appreciate their efforts.

I just think this is pretty neat.  For many Bitcoin exchanges, fraud costs them dearly, especially when taking card payments for Bitcoin.  miiCard offers identity verification purely online, when I started working for them back in 2012, I'll admit, none of us had Bitcoin on our minds in terms of potential customers but these Bitcoin exchanges that have started using us for identity verification are turning around and saying how much we've helped them.  There's something awesome about this story from BTCQuick in which they told us they've eliminated charge back fraud and that our service has paid for itself!
I think my favourite part is that now new buyers can get Bitcoin in minutes, including an identity check that is not only fast but also stops people worrying about potentially counterfeited document scans meaning these new businesses can get a real start into their new industry.
What do you guys think?  Wouldn't getting into a new exchange be so much easier if more of them allowed miiCard verification rather than document scans that can take days, sometimes weeks?

Personally, I pay my SSL certificate provider with Bitcoin and soon, I hope, my server costs with Bitcoin also.  You are quite right though, many will convert to other currencies, some of them instantly but they will pay a fee for that conversion through the exchanges usually, so individuals wanting out of Bitcoin could save themselves that fee, get themselves something they desire and let the business worry about the costs while also supporting them in the process :)
@_date: 2013-06-08 20:19:45
I've been working for ages to get this thing done, I've wanted to accept bitcoin for so long, I'd sell my belongings, anything (not my books, you can't have my books) just for that little bit of joy so that I could say I'm accepting Bitcoin.
Well, I've been working for ages on a major upgrade to my site which offers scottish, nae nonsense agile boards and I just launched it and guess what, I'm taking Bitcoin!  I'm so thrilled to finally be joining the community of Bitcoin sellers!
What was your first sell with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-06-20 21:29:58
Ha!  Love it, too late now though XD

Actually yes, every time I'm in London I really struggle with reading the map, I know it's a great design and a hell of a lot easier than it could be and I know many people have no difficulty but I really struggle with it anyway.
Either way, the Glasgow vs other railway maps thing is a common joke that I've often enjoyed so I wanted to latch on to it to give the video a little humour, I hate dull marketing videos.
I also do think that the alphabet has too many letters for the English language, why do we need the letter C for example when "circle" could be spelt "sirkle".  Though the mystery that I often find fascinating is in Polish where they have the letter W, a letter formed by two roman Us (U -&gt; V -&gt; Double U -&gt; Double V), their W produces the phonetic identical to our V sound however, they don't use the letter V.  I'd love to know the history of how they could have gained the evolution of the letter V, but kept the sound it makes while losing the letter itself.  I maybe think too much about these things :)

You still need to prove your identity with many Bitcoin services, that's where this internet identity service comes in to help with our internet money service! 
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:01:15
That's a fair point, would there be a default font colour that you think would work well on all notes or do you think there is a need for different colours on different note backgrounds?
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:24:25
I suppose it comes down to what people are willing to pay, perhaps new customers will happily value the speed of btcQuick (compared to the slower process of bank transfers and offline identity check) in a way that the scales of 5.5% will tip in their favour.  I don't know to be honest but I'm sure if I were running it and people were willing to pay the 5.5% or higher, I'd probably charge it too XD

Currently he only mews and purrs, his purrs come one after another, you might say he's "purr-2-purr"? (worst pun in the history of puns) XD

Evil Dr Eye is a cartoon I draw (badly) from time to time, usually to vent some frustrations, here's one about Bitcoin.

Thanks :)  I'm really quite obsessed with privacy.  I don't require people to confirm email addresses, in fact, I never used to ask for them at all, I simply didn't need them.  The only reason I started was to combat the amount of people who lost their passwords, I needed some method to send them password resets.

I've got Aspergers Syndrome, you're implying that I should go up to someone I don't know and talk to them with voice words and such, (hides in corner and rocks back and forth) nooooooo ;)
@_date: 2013-06-08 21:28:17
You've given me that extra little push, I'm buying it right now.  It's getting very close to my bed time though so I'll probably implement it in the morning as opposed to tonight.
@_date: 2013-06-11 14:54:51
Aha, good to hear :)

We just got him home, possibly the first creature in the world to be called Bitcoin :)

I was thinking switching to BitVPS but going to try convincing my Bhost (my current one) to accept Bitcoin.

Hi pardax, I made it using various screenshots and images found marked as creative commons online and they are just put together with Final Cut Pro X.  The titles are a number of default titles found within FCP.  I recorded the audio using quicktime before hand after spending a couple of minutes writing a quick script, hope that helps :)
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:54:23
Indeed, I'm going to be so excited when I see something, anything for sale in Bitcoin in a shop here in Scotland, the sad thing is, I'll probably run in that shop and buy it, even if it's a curtain made out of hemp... I should really move to silicon valley, I'm in the wrong place XD
@_date: 2013-06-11 14:54:32
lol, fair point XD
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:13:34
p.s. sorry  I should have sent you that in my feedback pre-launch :(
@_date: 2013-06-08 21:14:24
Ah!  That's the one thing big thing I'm ashamed to say I haven't added yet, I'm planning to implement it this weekend as I found NameCheap who offer SSL certificates affordably and for Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-06-05 10:40:21
If Bitcoin is the internet version of cash, surely this is the perfect answer to all those physical document checks we have to keep doing to get verified!
@_date: 2013-06-10 08:52:46
I wasn't implying that you couldn't, I only asked that people consider spending it as another option, I think many people forget that.  It's much like when you leave a country and think "I'd better spend all my foreign currency on stuff I'd otherwise buy at home so that I don't have to worry about the coversion charges at the bureau de change."  It's not in any way a demand, just a suggested consideration.

It is done, (I decided to stay up and get it sorted tonight).  All traffic is now directed through the much more secure 
@_date: 2013-06-08 21:38:48
Cool, thanks, I may get in contact with them :)
@_date: 2013-06-08 22:19:33
I will do, the order is placed and I'm awaiting the slowish back and forth with the certificate issuer to get it sorted.  Bitcoin payment for the certificate on NameCheap.com has been very smooth though so that's good :)

Try decreasing the size of your image file.  The image upload error can be a little cryptic but I found that after uploading a smaller image file it worked :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:52:00
Right now, if people are paying, I suppose it is.  Presumably as more fast payment based exchanges get set up, competition will be created and so the value will be reconsidered.  I can tell you from manning support tickets though that there is enough demand to have the 5x fees.  It sometimes feels weird to say but you can charge as much as your market is willing to pay.  Like the T-Shirts sold at a concert for $40 that can be bought elsewhere for $5.  If the people are willing to pay it, then it's the right price.  Luckily I don't generally have to make such decisions :)
@_date: 2013-06-09 19:48:24
Ah, good links!  I really should post my own site on there :)
