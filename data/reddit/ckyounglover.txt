I can't get a Visa or MasterCard debit card here, only a Maestro debit card. Banks just don't have it when you walk in and ask for it. Maestro is sometimes accepted on the internet, but not that often.

I agree that it's a bad idea, just that it isn't technically impossible. It can work for years as long as people keep trusting the bank.

I said generally. Sure, a lot of people in this thread apparently have a Visa or MasterCard brand debit card which works just as well as their credit card equivalents. But this doesn't work for most other brands of debit cards, and when Visa and MasterCard decide not to offer debit cards in your country, you're out of luck.

Of course, but they can give you real bitcoins, just like the gold-based bankers of previous centuries gave you real gold when you asked for it. As long as there isn't a bank run, people get everything they deposited back when they ask for it, so as far as they are concerned they own the bitcoins/gold the bank is storing for them.

I would as well.
But take the other extreme. Suppose you have a New York-based chain of liquor stores, and you decide to sell alcohol to 16-year olds in your stores in Germany, where this is perfectly legal. It's essentially the same situation, but my opinion here is completely different.
To me, it seems to depend a lot on a subjective judgement of the laws of the other country. While a country having a lower drinking age seems perfectly acceptable, a country allowing slavery doesn't. So the question then becomes, is it acceptable for France to have a different embargo policy? Or is the US convinced that their embargoes are so clearly justified that countries that disagree are obviously wrong?
I could see arguments for both sides.

Debit cards do not generally work on websites operating from another country. I need my credit card for stuff like Amazon, Steam, ... I even regularly order from Amazon.de and it doesn't take any debit card I could possibly acquire here.

What kind of debit card is it? I've heard that in some countries, Visa and MasterCard are in the debit card business as well, but in Belgium they aren't. So when you want Visa or MasterCard, you need to get a credit card (or open an account in another country, but who actually does that).

The point I'm trying to make is that the money only had to go through New York because of a formality, the fact that dollars were involved. From a practical perspective they were very much operating out of France.
It's as if you wanted to buy some alcohol, but due to a series of unfortunate events the dollar has crashed and the supermarket only accepts Saudi Riyals. Every time you as a US citizen buy some alcohol from a US supermarket Saudi Arabia gives you a fine because alcohol is illegal there. You know they can't do anything real to you as none of your important assets are in Saudi Arabia but they can take away your permission to do business in Riyals so you could never buy anything in a supermarket again.
Of course it's not a perfect analogy, but the US are definitely using the international importance of the dollar to force businesses in other countries to comply with their embargoes in a way that is at least questionable.

I'm sure you're aware what it is, just trying to make an analogy to show that it can be done with anything. My point is more about the possibility of it than about the viability, as the guy I replied to seemed to imply fractional reserve banking for bitcoins just doesn't exist as a concept.
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:06:29
No it doesn't. Debit cards do not generally work on websites operating from another country. I need my credit card for stuff like Amazon, Steam, and so on. It's the only reason I have it really, we don't have a culture of living on credit here.
@_date: 2014-07-24 03:35:29
It's ridiculous for two reasons.
The first is that none of what BNP Paribas did was illegal under French law. The only reason the US had anything to do with it was that dollars were involved. And Sudan is mentioned everywhere to make it sound more evil, but the charges also included violating the embargo on Cuba, an embargo which is considered ridiculous internationally. BNP Paribas were forced to plead guilty to all charges or face a trial for all of them, but maybe the charges about Sudan weren't as serious as the media implies and they mostly wanted to avoid a trial about the ridiculous Cuba embargo.
The second is that it's not even the people that have committed the crime that will pay the fine. It's the shareholders. 30% of BNP Paribas shareholders are the French and Belgian governments, so that's 2 billion dollars going straight from Belgian to New York taxpayers. That's one way to exploit the fact that you have the world's reserve currency.
@_date: 2014-07-24 10:02:28
I'm mostly just basing this on OP's article (except for the parts about Cuba which I read in the newspaper a while ago, so no source for that, sorry). I'm not an expert but the start of paragraph 3 seems to imply that the dollar denomination was the only reason they did any business in New York.
Yes, technically it was probably indeed their New York entity doing business. But I'm not doubting whether or not the US can technically do this, they definitely can. The thing is, in practice, these transfers were probably initiated by a banker in France. It's maybe even possible that nobody in New York had to press a single button. So is a fine like this also justified in practice?

Not Belgium, Belgium has always been a parliamentary democracy. It has a ceremonial monarch, just like a lot of modern countries, but the country had been independent for months before choosing to become a monarchy and appointing a royal family. It was never an absolute monarchy.

No you can't. Debit cards do not generally work on websites operating from another country. I need my credit card for stuff like Amazon, Steam, and so on. It's the only reason I have it really, we don't have a culture of living on credit here.

Debit cards do not generally work on websites operating from another country. I.e., the entire internet if you're not in the US.

The point of fractional reserve banking is that instead of being in possession of all your money, you go to a bank, and they agree to take your money in return for a piece of paper saying they owe it to you. You could conceivably do this with anything: you could hand over your car to your friend if they promise to pay you back a car with the same value (most likely the same car, but a new car if they crash yours). Bitcoin is no different.
I agree that it's important that people realise the difference between actually controlling your own Bitcoins, and giving it to a bank in return for an IOU, but I don't believe that claiming that Bitcoins stop being Bitcoins when they are lended out is the right approach. They're just Bitcoins you're likely to lose if your partner isn't trustworthy.
@_date: 2014-10-18 13:40:56


Do you mean that fractional reserve banking is impossible for Bitcoin? Because that's not necessarily true. It's not currently a part of the system, but it could become so.

No, Visa doesn't have debit cards here, only credit cards. The only debit cards available here are Maestro (a MasterCard brand, but not accepted as often as "regular" MasterCard), and VPay, which is accepted even less often.
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:52:36
Belgium. No bank provides MasterCard debit cards here, and some banks seem to provide "VPay" cards, which is a brand of debit card owned by Visa, but according to the internet it doesn't work on most websites (foreign websites that is, Belgian and some EU websites mostly accept normal Belgian debit cards so those sites are not a problem).
Edit: I've looked it up some more, and VPay is definitely not accepted anywhere outside Europe. It's not meant to be like a Visa card, it's just owned by Visa.

What? I used that word in a completely different way. I used it to describe the core principle of something, you used it to describe what some people believe to be the most important characteristic of something. It's different.

Bitcoin doesn't have an official point. Different people are excited about different parts of it.
