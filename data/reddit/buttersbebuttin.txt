1) [Proportionally, no one used it.](
2) [It cost them more money than they received.](
3) [Social stigma preventing larger donors from donating to an organization perceivably linked to a "ponzi"](
4) [Harassment for not promoting Bitcoin enough](
Take your pick, or you can call me a "butthurt buttcoiner" and write off everything I said as FUD intended to destroy your financial revolution.
Either way, more companies are dropping Bitcoin than are accepting it. There's reasons why (which have been rehashed over and over again) but unfortunately the echo chamber that is will *never* have a rational conversation as to why.

Preferential access to those coveted ten wire transfers a day when everyone else's money was locked in Gox?
IIRC Ver, Vorhees, and a few other "heavy hitters" in the BTC world had a good amount of their funds locked in the [at the time] largest BTC exchange.
While Ver claims to have lost BTC in the Gox collapse, I have a feeling it's a lot less than he *would have lost* had this video not been made...

You're free to go make your own altcoin with your crazy "only pay for actions under your control" ideas, but here in we follow the codebase according to Satoshi.

I feel that Gavin was between a rock and a hard place. If bitcoin is to succeed as a global currency, the block size needs to increase so that it can *actually service* the globe.
If the block size is kept below 1MB there won't even be *potential* for mass adoption, since the [admittedly small] Bitcoin community has proven itself able to fill up blocks, whether it's by gambling transactions, "stress tests", darknet transactions, or heck, even hypothetical real world transactions. 
Bitcoin was seen as a potential global currency in 2013 but has since flatlined. More development *needed* to happen, Bitcoin wasn't perfect as-is then, and it isn't now.
So Gavin proposed raising the block limit to increase adoption and the actual value provided by Bitcoin (if all the blocks are always full you'll never be able to submit a transaction, making Bitcoin useless to you), however an amalgamation of interests are working against him.
Yeah there's the devs that are working on blockstream et al standing to make a profit off of small blocks, but there's also the simple technical limitations - large blocks create a need for more storage and processing power, further centralizing the already-centralized "p2p" currency.
So you either increase the block size and make "bitcoin" accessible to more people, or you keep the block size as is and make *bitcoin* (read: original Bitcoin) accessible to "people" (the pre-existing Bitcoin community).
Either way, it will change what "bitcoin" is, considering "bitcoin" is defined as the divine word of Satoshi, and any change to his codebase is simply heresy.
You can have global or decentralized, but you can't have both. Globalization requires efficiency, which is the exact opposite of what a decentralized network aims to create (redundancy &gt; efficiency).
I used to be a "make blocks bigger to help the network grow" person, but after seeing the technical limitations, financial incentives in the discussion, and blatant inefficiency of the Bitcoin system either way, I've realized either route will still produce comedy gold, and that's all that really matters.

They're not potential customers. They never buy anything. They come in and demand to pay with bitcoin, and even when it is accepted, they say "awesome, you're supporting the bitcoin economy!" and then go on a tangent on how amazing it is and how much money I must be saving with it. AND THEN THEY NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING.

With all the blockchain posts [with no mention of Bitcoin whatsoever] you would think as long as it starts with a 'b', ends with a 'n', and has something to do with the internet, it's welcome.

Oh, I forgot this subreddit was only for people who have accepted Satoshi as their lord and savior.


Ah, the fabled "it costs absolutely nothing to accept Bitcoin" argument! 
Especially considering one of the top comments - even in the echo chamber that is - is acknowledging that companies don't train employees to accept Bitcoin because there is no financial incentive to do so.
Actually - and I know you won't like to hear this - I trained all my employees on how to accept Bitcoin, I promoted Bitcoin, and I hodl'ed a portion of my revenues. 
Accepting Bitcoin costs money - and I'm not just talking about the time it takes to train employees, deal with accountants, or anything like that. I'm talking on a basic fundamental level - there *are* fees associated with Bitcoin whether you want to acknowledge that or not. 
It costs businesses money to accept Bitcoin (around 1-2% of the transaction), and when most businesses see *less than* 1% of their revenues in Bitcoin and accepting Bitcoin leads to a 5-7% reduction in revenue due to social stigma and/or the paradox of choice, it actually costs them money to accept it.
But go ahead. Call me a butthurt buttcoiner, chalk up everything I said to a lie, and carry on knowing *you* have *The Truth*.

Bottom left. There's a row of links. The second one. It has numerous additional ways to give. They only offer credit card and PayPal on the front page since those are the three most widely used options and any more options leaves them open to the paradox of choice. Mozilla found that having a prominent bitcoin donation option they would lose 7% of their revenue. So Wikipedia moved the option to a less obvious area. If you want the bitcoin option next to the credit card and PayPal options, get enough people to donate to make it financially feasible to make such a change.

If a company takes in money and gives out a different currency, all the applicable laws apply to them, they can't point to another company and say "oh, we're using *their* licenses!" That's not how it works.


So a company would pay their lawyers to draft all the regulatory documents, then pay to change the basic structure of their business, then pay for the licenses, all to give out discounts to attract bitcoiners.
That would mean they would need *a lot* of Bitcoiners to come in and take advantage of that discount to cover those costs and make the company a profit.
If a company is making $100,000 a day (just using a simple, round number) before implementing this program, how much do you think it would go up once the Bitcoiners started supporting them? I am truly interested in what your estimation is of the growth to a business' revenue (accounting for the discount!) after implementing this.
@_date: 2015-07-26 21:28:09
No, it's pump and HODL.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:47:16
You and I know that. He knows that too. But if he acknowledges that it is proof positive the only reason he wants to "give" is to pump bitcoin. And even if he does figure out Wikipedia's *super confusing* one-click donation site, he'll come back and gloat about how he supported internet freedom, all the while the customer support person he harassed and evangelized to will be even more sure bitcoin is a cult (even more so considering they get emails like this weekly - I know at my work we get these "I would spend $300,000 with your company *if only you accepted Bitcoin*").
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:57:18
The business would need to register as a MSB. 
Why would Starbucks want to get into the currency exchange business, all to give Bitcoiners a 10% discount?
Take a step back. Why would a business invest in complying with all the regulations and paying for all the licenses of a money service business, *to give out discounts*?
What is their financial incentive to do so?
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:27:34
Yeah, we should only bully companies that *don't* accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:31:25
Back when I was active in bitcoin it was touted as an instantaneous fee-free decentralized payment network. 
Now we're totally fine with paying significantly sized (floating and uncertain) fees in off-chain transactions funneled through highly-centralized Chinese mining pools using state-subsidized electricity where we have to wait for 30 confirmations before we are certain we actually have the money. 
The goal posts aren't even moving anymore, they've been ripped out entirely as we feel around in the dark for bitcoin's killer app. 
All the selling points we've been using to get more people in bitcoin are a moot point.
And we wonder why more than half the merchants who accept bitcoin drop it within 6 months.
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:20:54
You're going to get downvoted but this is honestly the right answer.
Wikipedia doesn't care about anything but the bottom line - as any rational business is expected to.
Bitcoin leads to an average increase in sales of 0.02% while it leads to a ~5-7% reduction in revenue (paradox of choice and social stigma, not even mentioning the time and money it takes to train employees on bitcoin). 
If Bitcoiners want private businesses to advertise their magic internet money, they need to *actually use it* as money. Instead, they go around and demand businesses accept Bitcoin, refuse to spend it, and then say "See! Mass adoption! Microsoft, Overstock, Dell, ~~WordPress~~, and ~~Mozilla~~ accept Bitcoin. So what they don't actually make any money accepting it, *they accept it*! It will be any day now until we reach the moon!"
And then when the company makes the financial decision to drop Bitcoin, they are roundly harassed and threatened until they cave. We've seen countless times companies drop bitcoin only to face numerous negative reviews on Yelp, reddit, etc. When a business makes a decision in *their* rational interests, Bitcoiners make it their mission to destroy the business.
Businesses that accept Bitcoin continue to do so not because it is a significant source of revenue, but because (barring companies like Overstock in which the owner is ideologically - and financially - invested in the success - read: rise in price - of Bitcoin) they are afraid of the disgusting and frankly very scary response from the bitcoin "community".

1 BTC = 1 BTC, statist shill.
@_date: 2015-07-28 14:56:13
However what is not disputed is the market cap of the company in question, and if the company itself is worth less than a 1980 Toyota Tercel, it doesn't bode well. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:15:16


Bitcoin =/= the internet, but I have a feeling we won't be able to agree on that assertion.


This is a favorite argument when *any* business - whether they're Overstock, Mozilla, WordPress, etc publishes data that doesn't bode well for Bitcoin. Yeah well your products just don't interest us technological titans! And they're overpriced as well!
I made a good amount of money with Bitcoin -honestly, probably a bit more than most of the people who hang out here or every day talking about their latest TA trends.
I really want to see an alternative currency prosper - I am a globally minded person and would *love* to see a nonpartisan nonstate "global citizen" currency, which is exactly why I got into Bitcoin. 
But there are so many issues that need to be addressed yet never are (block size debate, anyone?), Bitcoiners are shooting themselves in the foot. Bitcoin was - and is - a very interesting technological (and one may argue, economic) experiment. I continue to follow Bitcoin development simply because I love new tech and hope to see something like Bitcoin take root in global commerce. Just a few weeks ago I spent over 3 weeks just making a simple wire transfer overseas - there is so much room for improvement within the traditional finance system, and no incentive for the existing institutions to ever change. Bitcoin is interesting. 
But the blind faith and opposition to *any* criticism - no matter how constructive - makes Bitcoiners look like a cult, scaring away normal business owners who are not ideologically tied to the libertarian core of Bitcoin (like Patrick Byrne).
EDIT: I see you're being downvoted, and I just want to let you know I upvoted you - while we may disagree, at least we're having a civil conversation. That's something that is needed more.
@_date: 2015-07-31 14:32:42
Except JWs want you to find salvation. Bitcoiners don't even intend to spend bitcoin when they have their monthly prostletyzing campaigns, they just want businesses to accept bitcoin so they can point to them and say "see! Mass adoption! You better buy some bitcoin before the price skyrockets! I'll buy something as soon as it's 1 million dollars per btc. Oh, and I expect a 30% discount because you know, fundamentals. And don't tell me bitcoin doesn't save you money but actually costs you money. I took a high school economics class, I know what I'm talking about."
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:37:44
What's the incentive for a merchant to accept a decentralized currency if the first step is to sign up with a centralized payment processor? Merchants certainly are not signing up to accept bitcoin for the volume, as bitcoin is generally less than a tenth of a percent of their sales, and as previous A/B tests have shown, accepting bitcoin often leads to an overall *decrease* in revenue. So the only merchants adopting bitcoin are either ideologically invested in the politics of Bitcoin, or were convinced by one of the prostletyzers here that accepting bitcoin will be a major boon for their business.

It's possible that the cost to reintegrate it is not made financially feasible by the revenue it generated.
