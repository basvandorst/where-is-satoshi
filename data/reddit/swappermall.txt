Max Keiser just did a YouTube episode with Stacey Herbert and Simon Dixon that gives an interesting perspective on the latest Bitcoin divide.  As Max puts it, it's a code war between humanity and the banks.  Core Developers want to prevent untested code from wresting control from the bitcoin community and Classic, XT developers and others want bank consortia like the R3 project to dominate bitcoin innovations for profit motives that are questionable.

Considering how long it takes to download the Bitcoin blockchain, I am leery of increasing the block size at all.  I think any such increase could slow user growth.  The Core Developers should be trusted to fully explore and test alternative approaches that have been proposed for scaling up that do not involve significant increases in block size.  I have not personally experienced the bitcoin congestion that Mike Hearn describes, nor does the data I've looked at suggest that Bitcoin blockchain failure is imminent.  Should the issue of block size be subject to negotiations when there are plausible alternatives?  I'm not so sure.  Dash just did a block size increase to 2 MB.  I'd like to know how that experiment works before changing Bitcoin.

Income earned as a miner of bitcoins is taxable in the same way as anyone else who earns income, whether the income is in the form of bitcoins or federal reserve notes (usually referred to as US dollars).  On the other hand, income earned from speculating on the Bitcoin market is taxable in a different manner.  As a general statement, citizens of the United States are taxed on increases in their wealth, whether the wealth is sourced in earned income or increases in the value of property.  So, if someone buys a painting for $1000 and then sells it for $2000, there has been a gain of $1000 and at the time of the sale, the seller has incurred a tax liability that will be assessed at some percentage of the $1000 gain.  If the property were a house, a one time lifetime exemption might eat up any tax liability on the gain in value, but there are no such exemptions for bitcoins.  Think of bitcoins as generally being taxable in the same manner that property is taxed.  For details beyond that, consult an attorney or an accountant.  This is not legal advice, for I don't know who you are and we have no attorney/accountant/client relationship.

Crashing? It's higher now ($327) than what it said in the TIME article ($305).
