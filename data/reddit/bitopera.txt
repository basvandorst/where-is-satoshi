Bitcoin won't work without the blockchain.  You can probably make many permutations of the blockchain that work differently, nothing too special about that  unless there is something for the masses.  Bitcoin is that secret sauce that makes the bitcoin blockchain special.  It has become the most distributed decentralized ledger on the planet and you can write to that ledger using bitcoin.  Pretty big deal that is.

This guarantees that people will run bots to compete against themselves to maximize profits.  This will inflate the user stats.

how does a microchip in your hand change anything?

This is Pesos.
  
1 Argentine Peso equals about 0.11 US Dollars

You need to be more conscientious about how you handle your coin going forward.  Since bitcoin is traceable, you can leave yourself wide open if you trust others to act on your behalf with your wallets.  Being lazy or complacent can cost you.  It already has, because coinbase is a great service that keeps improving.  They may not be the fastest but they are very consistent and their offerings\integration continues to grow.  I appreciate having them as a resource.

Coinbase Adrian indicated that they sent it directly from coinbase.  Pretty dumb move that they will most likely not make again.

Of course not, it's for your own protection.

Possibly.  If banks run out of physical euros then Greeks will be looking for alternatives.

"While there has been no sign of a full-scale bank run in Greece since Mr. Tsipras’s announcement, the lines at cash machines on Saturday in Athens were much longer than they had been in recent days."

I don't see how this has any "ramifications".  It helps them move their *shit* around in a centralized manner like they prefer.

Maybe they're worried there will be a larger run in the morning or because they withdrew yesterday and this is the earliest they can withdraw now.  There is usually a daily atm withdraw limit and banks have been closed.

I'm interested to know too.  Can anyone walk us through the hard fork from pre-hard fork block to hard fork block?

No need to burn!

It's certainly a niche product at those exchange rates but don't under estimate what people will pay for convenience.  I doubt there are many fools buying bitcoin and then sending it to xapo and spending it with the card, that would be silly.
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:24:41
What is your argument for that?
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:32:45
This is a good point, there are limits to how much you can take out of an ATM and if banks stay closed people might panic. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:12:42
This is not a good bet.  There isn't going to be a codified change to supply and demand until 2016.

Seems more probable that it would be the result of *extracurricular* activities on the part of government contractors, not something coordinated or official.  If bitcoin lives up to its potential the us government stands to gain from mass domestic adoption rather than bitcoin succeeding by adoption elsewhere.  They would lose out on tremendous capital gains and security for its people while empowering foreign entities and potential foes.  Not something the US usually does.

Works for me...

A few around here have mentioned they have bought GBTC with their IRA.  
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:08:00
They aren't going to launch it until they have an ETF.
@_date: 2015-07-03 01:32:36
Good point.
@_date: 2015-07-03 01:33:18
No thank you.
@_date: 2015-07-01 01:25:38
This might be affordable if you only gave it to Greeks that paid their taxes the previous year. /s
  
Seriously though, I think this would be a great outreach campaign and it could be artificially throttled to make it affordable.  Make it only for a 24 period and for people who completely verify their identity.  If it goes well and you can afford it, do another 24 hour giveaway.
