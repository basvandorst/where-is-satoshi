Social Alpha Foundation
It’s a new crypto charity giving $ grants to projects using Blockchain for social welfare (public health, education, environment). They raise money in crypto donations from those people and projects (ico’s) who have benefited from the market and are ready to give back. 
A senior partner from PWC is on the advisory board and future projects will be vetted by committee members like Loi Luu from Kyber, Jacquie Chow from the HK Society for Protection of Children (a 100yr old charity), Dr. David Lee a crypto angel and professor at Singapore University of Social Sciences, and Smith and Crown the ico research website. 
It’s still in Beta so just getting off the ground, but they are getting ready to announce their first project grantee related to Blockchain and children’s education by end of year.

I gave an oral presentation which generally followed the following structure - the below is what I recall off the top of my head (yes, many of the phrases/ideas are not original and are oft-repeated in our community):
I. Introduction
  a. Who I am (ie non-tech, non-finance bystander bitten by btc bug)
  b. how I got into Bitcoin (ie. epiphany courtesy of Chris Dixon article)
  c. Bitcoin=internet in 1992, and the opportunities this creates for you as the listener, and we as a society
  d. Bitcoin is not just about the currency, it's the foundation of generations of software and hardware
II. Bitcoin basics
  a. Open-source ledger
  b. How mining works
  c. Coin limit and network auto-adjustments
  d. Pseudonymity
  e. Created by Satoshi (no, not Dorian)
III. Why is Bitcoin different
  a. Idea of decentralization (which powers future generation of tech)
  b. Solves double-spend problem 
  c. Trustless online transactions to enable true digital economy
  d. Faster speed, less friction
IV. Benefits of Bitcoin
  a. Helping the unbanked
  b. Reducing costs for retailers
  c. True ownership of assets (unseizable)
V. Current challenges of Bitcoin
  a. Volatile price makes investment risky
  b. Personal security (hacking of BTC holders)
  c. Lack of widespread adoption
VI. Beyond bitcoin
  a. Ethereum and decentralized application frameworks
  b. Maidsafe and secure internet
  c. Smart property/contracts
  d. Digital transaction identity for the Internet of Things
I also take questions throughout, and encourage them to keep asking basic questions so they have a solid foundation to build on. 
Recurring Questions (in random order)
1. How do I get a bitcoin (Satoshi Square-&gt;Local Bitcoins-&gt;ATM-&gt;Exchange)
2. What happened at Mt Gox (poor management)
3. Can't someone just change the 21mil limit (yes, but impossible to get everyone else on the network to adopt your change)
4. What is mining (transaction verification builds the backbone of the network)
5. Where is the price going to go (up. eventually.)
Hope this helps - part of the RISE:Bitcoin project is to formalize things like this so anyone can give a clear, concise presentation. Ping me if you're interested to know more so I know there's demand.

As I understand, MD's are pretty high up there though they have Partner/MD's (even higher) and normal MD's. The ones I met seemed to be in their late 40's/early 50's and had around 15+ years with the bank. The ED's were much younger though, and it was explained that they are the "VP's" in a sense...most were in their 30's.

Not sure about fearful, because they don't see it as a threat per se. More like they understand what they understand, and think that that's the end of the story. Bitcoin is a fundamental paradigm shift, and it's hard to understand, much less internalize that in a 40min presentation.
I walked away positive because they a) showed up, b) asked questions and c) were dismissive at first, but inquisitive later on. I'm sure there will be a lot of googling after this...
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:34:37
To get back to the point, your idea is a good one but perhaps at this point the foundation is too weak to execute on this. Perhaps a payment subgroup of the biggest payment processing companies could be lobbied to form a non-partisan work group. You may get more traction this way. If you're serious about this, why not start by appealing to those companies' heads over twitter and reddit? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:25:39

frustratingly, Facebook 'report' interface doesn't easily allow me to report that a friend's account has been hacked in this particular way. they have to do it themselves (which they've done now). interface only allows me to report if the friend's account is spamming me, or if someone is impersonating my friend.

nice! totally slipped my mind, thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:27:15
I think it's just too early for banks to talk about it in a meaningful way. It will happen b/c the technology has too much utility to ignore, and there is too much value and $$ to be created from new industries and products built on top of this technology. It's just too early. How many banks were jumping into the internet in 1992 anyway :-D

Also worth nothing that (it seemed) most people were interested personally. I didn't get the sense that they were there trying to figure out how to make money for Goldman, because I doubt it's really on their radar in a serious way yet. Maybe when the ETF's hit, but the volume/risk of most exchanges would still be a disincentive to really start trading coins on an institutional level.

I'm a btc investor/evangelist, co-founder of RISE:Bitcoin open source btc information event. Just have friends at these places and offer to give casual intro talks. I think it's good to talk to all types of people about Bitcoin, so I do talks to general public and also talks to financial professional audiences. Just a hobby :-)

Check out Entrust - you can transfer some of an existing IRA to their IRA and then they will invest in SecondMarket for you. No need for you to set up a self-directed IRA at all.
You *will* need to be an accredited investor though, so $200k annual salary or $1mil in total officially appraised assets (car, house, 401k, stocks etc)

I have a few friends that work there, and after literally hours of me talking their ears off about how Bitcoin will form the foundation of our digital economy, they said "why don't you come talk to my colleagues" and so I did, and did, and did. (And will)

Thanks :-D I think the community has enough meetups in bars and cafes. Nothing wrong with this and this should continue, but maybe it's good to reach out to different audiences - that's my feeling. I'm fortunate to live in a financial capital, but there are influencers and heads of companies everywhere. Many of them are genuinely curious what all this fuss is about - they just don't know who to ask for a good plain-spoken explanation!

I hosted a talk in HK with the founder Joe Lee an ex investment banking professional. While I haven't tried the site, I can say that he was early to the Bitcoin scene, well-informed and very legit. My friend does trade on btc.sx and said it's good, but I don't have firsthand experience. 
During our talk founder mentioned he would be switching from Gox-based to another exchange.

@_date: 2014-09-05 22:12:07
Thanks, but he actually knows what it is and how it works on the currency transfer side of things. I believe his bank actually published their own internal report. This outreach is more to leapfrog the inherent bias he has against Bitcoin the currency and engage on the Bitcoin the technology. 
He's much too intelligent and experienced for me to debate and win the first part, but if I can shift the argument to smart contracts/smart property then I'm talking about things he doesn't know about...
@_date: 2014-07-30 11:16:20
I would describe the mood as interested but highly reserved/skeptical, compared to finance professionals. There were a lot of questions but the tone was slightly more negative. 
General knowledge of Bitcoin was low, and not a single person actually owned any. Attendees were mostly from Fortune 500 companies and top Asian companies. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:30:24
I meant that they were personally interested to learn about Bitcoin; they were not there as a function of their jobs, or to specifically explore how Bitcoin could be incorporated into their dept/desk.
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:28:09

I would also look into ethereum as I have a similar outlook and find ethereum's application layer potential to be closer to my understanding of crypto's potential than Bitcoin alone.

@_date: 2014-09-22 18:13:32
Interesting idea. Your idea makes me think of something slightly different, a Blockchain based library. Each coin = a book which can then be transferred back and forth between parties, perhaps loaded into a kindle/tablet for reading, stay locked so not easy to simply copy, and with some transaction later built in. What do you think of that?
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:35:42
You may want to research smart contracts inside ethereum, project eris, codius, and even perhaps done of the existing Blockchain based messaging systems like bit message.

This was an opt-in talk, so everyone there was taking time out of their day to be there. There didn't seem to be any skeptics, though I guess it's a self-selecting group. In general reactions were all positive - everyone just wanted to know more. Only one person in the entire group of around 15-20 had ever bought bitcoin, but they all seemed to accept the significance. I spoke to my friend who invited me, and she was also surprised that such senior people showed up to such a casual talk.

I've been thinking that High School and College level audiences are good targets for developing BTC. There's a lot of them, they can be motivated/obsessive when there's something to gain, and BTC is a relatively accessible topic. Maybe you could consider attempting a viral video about BTC for students?

I'm also looking at Seedcoin and would appreciate hearing people's experiences/impressions (or lack thereof).
I've met one of the founders and he seems knowledgable about Bitcoin, but when it comes to the fund I don't know if there is much information/proper prospectus, etc. which seems odd.
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:13:02
Anecdotally (I live in HK) Bitcoin is gaining momentum rapidly. I've had many informal education sessions with high-level bankers (my friends) and more and more are asking me to explain and/or help them buy coins.
We're a banking town with highly dense and efficient networks, and while not all finance professionals are Bitcoin believers, most are aware of it and curious. I've read that 2014 will be the year Wall Street discovers Bitcoin, but I think HK will be the leading edge of that movement. 
Msg me if anyone wants more info on HK's scene

Obviously my naivete is at fault; never occurred to me while he was asking that it wasn't him. But it really is a good scam so hope people will take this as a cautionary tale - especially those of us eager to help anyone and everyone get involved in Bitcion.

Thanks for the AMA, very helpful!
Another question - what do you do with your coins? Sell all regularly or hold some/sell some? If the price is low will you hold until the price improves? 
Also, how do you sell, just on a regular exchange or do you have a way of locking in a price using futures? I think I saw in the calculations that you're making like 17xbt/month (may be mistaken) so not so hard to sell on a normal exchange.
