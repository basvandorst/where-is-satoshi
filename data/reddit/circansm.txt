I think the adage is "you can't predict the market based on past performance".
So, people have been screaming for over a decade that Amazon was a bubble. Yet, for 15 years, buying and holding Amazon has been the smartest Amazon investment strategy.
Amazon is a clear indicator that market performance (not just asset performance, with your narrow ass "maybe I can rescue the negative by straw manning the affirmative" debate style) can not be predicted based on past performance.
Your entire argument is invalid dude. You're out here preaching to people that just because something happened before doesn't mean it's going to happen again, while in the same breath telling people "this is what always happens"

The very idea of a surplus store is a myth/lie perpetrated on consumers.
Just like outlet stores, the products in surplus stores are licensed by the brands, not manufactured. The clothes you can buy there would have NEVER been in an actual brand store.
Similarly, Sharper Image didnt make the contraption: it was made by gas station merchandisers and a sharper image logo was slapped on it to convince you its a steal.

I get it fully, sir. Im on your side.
What im saying is this thing debuted at TechCrunch, theres already a bunch of articles about it. Lets say it gets 100k users.
Then, lets say a giganti  bear on the futures market gets a hold of the app (buys it outright), or worse, figures out how to trick its sentiment analysis.
Bear places massive short term pessimistic bet against Bitcoin. Triggers app. Market manipulation in the form of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Wait so yeah, DEFINITELY there was mad positive news on the rally up to 20k, whats your point?
If BTC crashes down to $10k and then slowly climbs back to $15k over the next 4 months, I dont think the majority of the people you're talking to here give a shit about that.
So your disaster and my disaster may be entirely separate. You seem pretty doomy and gloomy though friend.
I would never spend this much time to try to convince a bunch of strangers that an investment might go back to where it was a month ago. Are you being paid to do this?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:15:18
I'm not trying to predict the market price at all, just arrive at a provable value.
For instance, and this is obviously a simplified example:
Lets say I want to take the equivalent of $1,000,000 USD and hide it, so that no organization or government could lay claim to it. That isnt entirely possible, but there are services out there that provide a close-as-it-gets effect of hiding your money (Swiss bank account, for example).
What does it cost to store that $1,000,000 indefinitely? Lets assume the account fees and the economic opportunity cost of not investing that $1,000,000. Lets peg it at $100,000 over 20 years (it's probably more, but lets say).
Well, when CNBC says Bitcoin has no value, arent they leaving out that $100,000 (and many more)?
That is real, easy to understand, and easier-than-impossible to calculate value. Shouldnt we be developing that equation and pushing that narrative?

Bitcoin has retraced severely on an almost monthly basis literally the entire time I've had money in it. 
Every single time it does, news sites post that Bitcoin is crashing. This has to be the first time you've gone through this if you think the sentiment on the internet is worse now than it has ever been.
Nobody is mistaken in saying Bitcoin would always go up in value. Nobody was mistaken to think that the internet would always go up in value.
I'm saying that if you think Bitcoin won't always go up in value you're not looking at a big enough time scale. Zoom out. Bitcoin is the dominant blockchain with the most users and the most attention.
With Atomic Swaps and LN, Bitcoin and other blockchains won't be so separated. With that, you will eliminate the idea of winners and losers, which is something that AA has been talking about for years - there is no winner coin. If there is no winner coin, and Bitcoin isn't going away, then to say Bitcoin won't always go up you should be willing to assert that blockchain will not always become more adopted.
If you're willing to say that, you don't understand the technology. This technology is going to eat private enterprise. Private enterprise is worth far more than Bitcoins current price.
If you don't think Bitcoin will "always go up", you don't understand what's happening here.
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:31:28
I disagree. Net consensus does not nullify the adversarial nature of individual actors on the network. These well intentioned actors are still acting in their best interest, they just have a more informed (in my opinion) or differing perspective of risk and reward.
The system is mathematically adversarial - the effect, thus far, has been the prevention of centralization. This isnt a mistake, it appears to be an intentional consequence of the system's design.
I think people get away from that idea - Bitcoin was designed for this to not happen.
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:32:33
Mining pools self regulate because of well-intentioned miners. When pools approach centralization miners will often switch pools. 
To even get to a consensus 51%, where all of the miners contributing that hash power all agree to behave in one way, you would need to orchestrate 51% of the mining community. Imagine orchestrating 51% of all political representatives worldwide on a single topic... its not likely, regardless of the potential rewards.
And the potential rewards for such an expensive and difficult operation are eclipsed many times over by the cost of doing so.
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:29:04
When you guys say "they", youre talking about a lot of people. More than Bitmain.
Bitmain does not come close to 51% of hash rate all on their own.
When the pool gets close, miners switch pools. Because miners are a swarm, not three guys playing RISK with eachother. The average contributing miner does not want any pools to achieve 51% of hash rate.
Also, getting 51% of the hash rate does not allow the advantage or potential for damage you all seem to think it does.
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:35:13
thats not how it works
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:11:46
Andreas Antonopoulos pretty regularly addresses this fear as unfounded and ridiculous. Any search for aantonop and 51% will yield you a the more reasonable argument.
I guarantee you the reality is not "OHMY GOD BITCOIN IS GOING TO CATCH FIRE AND BITMAIN WILL DRIVE IT INTO THE GROUND!"
Mining pools naturally weaken upon even the hint of approaching 51%. BTC self regulates quite nicely (as it was intended to)
If you are worried about this, you either dont understand mining pools or dont understand game theory.

1. People who do illegal things
2. Overdraft fees
Crypto makes sense for anyone living close to the poverty line (see: everyone) because they frequently lose access to banking due to the poor tax that is overdraft fees. BofA was actually caught rearranging the order of transactions to charge more overdrafts - MULTIPLE times.
And, anyone who wants to:
- Purchase equipmemt to grow or create their own drugs
- Purchase drugs
- Use the services of a prostitute
- Gamble
- Murder someone
- Buy illegal weapons
- Buy counterfeited goods
- Buy banned goods
- Violate a trade embargo
Ipso facto, a crushing majority of EVERYONE, crypto makes sense for them. Banks and even services like Venmo can restrict your access to accounts associated with ANY of these activities AND they can be subpoenaed to provide incriminating transaction records.
Also remittance.

Yeah these people dont understand marketing...
Bitcoin is a purple cow - first of its kind - first to market.
And, because of the points OP illustrated, whereas some purple cows can be usurped by intra-vertical innovation, any innovation introduced into the cryptocurrency ecosystem and validated to work well while maintaining decentralization gets incorporated into the Bitcoin protocol.
Its not like an asset or a company - its more like the federal government. Alts are states. They can buck the system, introduce cutting edge policies, and even sometimes make the Fed look stupid. But make no mistake - its just a lab. The Fed is the field.
Bitcoin is the field.

I know that China announced an ICO ban recently, but thats not what I'm referencing.
Today, a Chinese financial news site leaked an unconfirmed report that China was planning on shutting down Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, which represent a massive segment of trading volume.
The reaction to THIS news was ALSO a massive sell-off, this time bigger than the first.
I just want to know from someone who understands the actual trading data if buy orders are meeting sell orders. It would be awesome to actually be able to read the data and see an army of enthusiasts coming in to swallow this massive sell off.
