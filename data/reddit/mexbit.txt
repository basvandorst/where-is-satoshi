Great image... but not sure if many in the bitcoin community believe the moon landings happened. ;)

He has for the last 8 months stopped doing any mentions. I have seen details of what was offered there and I would not buy either...
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:31:35
0.06 like last month... btc has lost 3 billion in marketcap since then... i think btsx will have a higher marketcap than bitcoin soon...

What is your opinion regarding this statement? It seems like Mexico on one side does not think that Bitcoin is anything... on the other side it calls Bitcoin an Asset ("activo") at the end of the statement.
Also a pity that it did not clarify if VAT applies. Although by not recognizing it as a currency, asset or other type of investment I think one could imagine that VAT has to apply, which would make Mexico a very hostile place for Bitcoin. Even Britain has changed their mind regarding VAT with their statement last week.
But the VAT issue might be something that has to be decided by SAT (the mexican IRS). In case that no VAT, nor regulation (like in the statement by Banco de Mexico) applies on the principal this might be excellent news??

Do not take my word for it... if you research it you will see that PoW never was more than a temporary solution to start bitcoin... there is no long term feasibility of such a wasteful technique... PoS secures the network using their stakeholders. You do not hold stake, you cannot do anything... you want to do 51% attack, buy 51% of the coins... this would send the price through the roof. So basically not feasible... and no daily dumping of new coins from miners...
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:46:36
Do not laugh... for as little as 500 million dollars you can take down Bitcoin if you want to... there are banks who are able to pay 10.000 million in fines in a year... so diversify in a solid PoS-only coin.
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:06:08
Not sure what this means? Everybody believes in the moon landings or no one? I did not say anything specific. :)
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:29:27
I think as well that many will use this as a marketing instrument... mining the majority for themselves afterwards... perhaps we will get like 100 of these distributed AltCoins...
In the end it might be excellent for Bitcoin... helps the people to get started... It might be nice to hand out a dollar worth of Bitcoin, but people will not be very interested to get into it... They might like the idea to have 1000 SpainCoins, but later on they perhaps just cash out to Bitcoin... interisting experiment...
Might lead to mass adoption of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-09-20 05:01:19
This is a feature you do not have to use. But you can use it and it is actually quite easy with 4 buttons... I tried it... you should try it with 1 USD as well, so that you can see how intuitive it is. Even for normal transfers this is much better... every 10 seconds a block... and 1 confirmation is enough.... not 6 or whatever like in Bitcoin. Also anonymous and possibility to register a name.
@_date: 2014-08-22 06:21:09
Now 2 hours and nothing... This is unacceptable... The last time I had such delays was a year ago withdrawing from MtGox...
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:02:27
Good that you have so well founded arguments. :)
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:47:56
Yeah, but if you were better organised you could refill it in 10 minutes instead of 3 hours... This did cost me a lot of money... :(
@_date: 2014-08-22 05:43:06
Anybody else with delays? I hope it will not take days... :(
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:33:33
If the transactions of the last 4 weeks disappeared I guess nobody would accept bitcoin anymore as a method of payment.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:26:18
Forget about mining. This is something of the past. PoS/DPoS is the future.
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:40:33
I think BlackHalo is better and more configurable for this task... I already made 2 Smart Contracts... 
@_date: 2014-08-22 06:39:28
Mintpal just answered my ticket, and have done the transaction... hotwallet was empty according to them...
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:31:27
Yeah... this technology was good to start with, but really looks like a fax machine with what is available today...
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:54:41
I thought the same thing... but not anymore... I do not see outsiders wanting to buy, and insiders are moving on to less wasteful and more useful coins...
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:37:31
That is not possible with PoW.... you have to go PoS, like BlackCoin...
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:44:10
Bitsharesx is doing quite fine... btsx
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:56:18
Bitcoin is hopelessly overvalued compared to 2.0 technologies like bitsharesX. Btsx should be worth 7 billion and bitcoin 60 million... i think this is what the market seems to realize....
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:24:37
I know what you mean... but the sustainability in Fiat is there because of aggression and government decree...
Bitcoin is BLEEDING because of PoW.
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:58:25
Great! Blackcoin is an excellent choice! Thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:26:52
Buy a PoS-only coin like BlackCoin and forget about these issues. :)
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:49:54
Yep. The energy consumption is limited to 25×440 usd every 10 minutes. So 1.3 million usd a day.
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:39:31
With PoW it is impossible to solve... It has to be PoS-only, like BlackCoin.
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:33:47
Beside the horrible electricity and hardware expenses in the Proof-of-Work protocol, which I think amount to something like 700 Million Dollars in a year, it also eliminates 51% attack fear, as an outside attacker would have to buy the majority of the money supply (good luck with that) in order to create havoc, which would make the price of the currency skyrocket while he is buying his stake to 51%.
Transaction fees can be almost nothing under Proof-of-Stake. In case of growing hashing power the electricity cost might require really high costs which might make Bitcoin not a good competitor. People would all switch to Proof-of-Stake coins.
BlackCoin has been only 6 weeks around and Coinkite already said they would support it in their terminals june 1st!
I would like to have Bitcoin the Proof-of-Stake protocol in order to be able to compete with new currencies like BlackCoin. Does someone know if the Core-Devs have this in mind?
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:46:42
That is why I left bitcoin... take a look at btsx...
@_date: 2014-09-19 23:46:40
Do not forget that already there are many other networks which have many advantages... no energy waste, transfers in seconds instead of hours, anonymous transfers....
@_date: 2014-10-05 02:23:00
I invest in the future... not the past... and btsx with bitUSD bitCNY and so on is definitely the way to go. No energy waste and 5 second transactions. No counterparty risk and anonymous... bitcoin has none of that.
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:18:40
Although the price of blackcoin is down brutally at the moment. The logic of miner costs because of wasted energy brought me to blackcoins pos. It does not burn 2 million a day but 0... but i started thinking markets did not care anymore...
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:36:44
Look at btsx. :)
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:36:43
Please explain. What do you not like about PoStake?
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:24:06
Imho I think nobody should be invested in bitcoin 1.0 technology if far better solutions are out there. But this is only my opinion... people here will tell you to stay with bitcoin no matter what alternatives are out there..
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:23:16
The difference is that the Bitcoin price would tank in the process of the attack.. no rise whatsoever. In the case of BlackCoin in the process it would get from 0.10$ to 100000$. And you could cash out in the meantime... That is the difference...
@_date: 2014-09-12 22:01:54
I simply say that crypto-assets still are like nothing... For example Gold has a marketCap more than 1000 times higher than the whole cryptomarket... But there is more... debt instruments, shares etc... Crypto is like nothing still... Perhaps another coin might be the biggest one... but I think Cryptomarket as a whole will have to rise... we will see...
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:05:05
Yeah... still... but my point is that btsx should have 20 times the marketcap of bitcoin imho. So where do you invest? In a hopelessly overvalued 1.0 technology for a 100 times the marketcap, or on 2.0 technology like btsx?
I think the market is going to do this...
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:19:52
It is idiotic? Have you not been following events for the last 6 months especially?? In the article they talk about that in the next few days fights between russians and ucraine (Nato helps them) could start:
"Die Angst vor einem lokal nicht begrenzbaren Krieg wird immer größer.
Wie raus aus dieser Spirale, die ein direktes Aufeinandertreffen ukrainischer und russischer Truppen in den nächsten Tagen immer wahrscheinlicher werden lässt?"
**Translation: "The fear of a locally not limited war becomes greater. How to escape the circle of rising conflict which makes a collision between ucranian and russian troops in the next days very likely."**
This is n-tv.de... not an apocalypse blogger...
I think World War 3 would be tragic for humanity, but for Cryptocurrency this could give a great boost as all the other currencies would go downhill...
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:10:42
Bitcoin relies on hash power to secure the network... if not you would have to switch to proof of stake like blackcoin...
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:35:42
The thing is that if someone would decide today to buy 70% of a PoStake coin like BlackCoin, would this not raise the price astronomically? I mean even buying up 20% of all Bitcoins, like 2.6 million BTC would make the price rise too much for any one attacker... even banks could not keep up with this price rise...
So in the end I do not see this kind of attack feasible. And if this would be done the holders of the PoStake coin would get very rich... So I think they would not object to such an attack. :)
@_date: 2014-04-20 22:11:05
Thanks for the explaination. Is this issue not addressed already in the newer coins like BlackCoin? Do you have a link where one can read the details of this latest coin? Perhaps they found some solution for this or implemented this in another way? 
@_date: 2014-08-22 05:52:37
btc withdrawal... but the transaction has not been sent... (this would be "successful" status)
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:12:13
Be careful btc is superslow... wastes energy like hell... and needs third parties to park money in usd. Better take a look at btsx
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:48:10
General public is busy learning what bitcoin is at the moment... I guess it might take 5 years more before they begin learning about bitshares-x.
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:47:48
You should read it... I think he is a 100% correct... and the effects you can see in the price... But you can choose to read it as well after Bitcoin is not in the top 10 of cryptocurrencies anymore.
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:10:14
Look into DPoS. This is the best solution I have seen so far.
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:34:50
The problem is that you are burning energy senseless... You need buyer for 3300 BTC a day only to maintain the price... and what will happen if the rewards get halved twice again? Do you turn off the miners or ask for 100 USD transaction fees? Even the current price drop will force miners to sell a larger amount of their bitcoins in order to just pay for their electricity bills. Or stop mining if they do not earn enough... This system like it is does not work long term... Think about it.
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:57:06
I would love to hear how you would destroy it! :)
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:53:19
Bitcoin is worth a measly 6 billion only... worldwide the assets are worth a 1000 trillion...
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:36:36
Yep... pos or dpos are the way to go...
@_date: 2014-07-12 17:13:41
Yep... but PoS-only BlackCoin has 99.9% less emissions than Bitcoin AND is resistent against 51% hashing attacks. And now it has as well BlackHalo for Smart Contracts...
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:21:24
BlackCoin has BlackHalo and its decentralized exchange NightTrader will be online soon... google it...
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:14:38
Yep, he is right... you depend on third parties (exchanges) if you want to park your money in USD for a while... In bitshares-x you can park it within the bitUSD market without a counterparty risk other than the risk of technical failure, and can switch back when you think the shares will go up again... do that with bitcoin... you can't...
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:03:59
For now centralization is working out just fine for Bitcoin... I guess that if you want to get something decentralized there is no way to go but PoS-only... Bitcoin can change from PoW to PoS if the devs let it happen... But as I know Gavin, I think they will not change Bitcoin until it is too late... So diversify and buy some BlackCoin as well ;)
@_date: 2014-09-19 01:35:02
Great argumentation. :)
@_date: 2014-08-22 06:26:09
I know.... but in the meantime what I wanted to buy has risen 40%, so I am not really happy about this. Fucking Mintpal... I will never use them again.
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:47:21
Bitcoin can be taken down by a non-broadcasted 51% fork in the blockchain and announcing it 3 weeks later... the longest chain is the valid one... so all transactions for 3 weeks would not be on this new blockchain, and everybody who has sold something in the these 3 weeks would loose faith and leave bitcoin. Some intelligent people would go to PoS-only coins like BlackCoin, others would start to ignore the cryptocurrency world all together having gotten burned... and the value of Bitcoin and all other PoW coins dropping like a stone....
@_date: 2014-08-22 06:12:01
This means that I confirmed by email. They have not send the transaction... :(
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:35:35
Yes, absolutely. For a 1.0 version Bitcoin was brilliant... but long term I only see future for PoS systems, especially DPoS as well!
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:38:43
The problem is right now you can kill off Bitcoin by launching a 51% attack by buying for two billion dollars equipment and destroying transaction processing... The people who have these 2 Billions can destroy your money anytime if they like....
If they want to take a 60% Stake in Bitcoin they would have to pay in the last units a million bucks,,, I guess we all would cash out there... so an attack would not make any sense...
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:44:04
Yes... Maximum.... If 50% of people participate (in terms of blackcoins), I understand money supply would go up 0.5% per year)... Better than btc at the moment... Surely more people loose their key than that...
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:12:51
Everybody is entitled to their opinion. This article shows that the author has not understood the concept. He can stick with bitcoin and 2 hour transfers with dependence on third party exchanges if he wants to park the money in case of a downturn. I think 5 seconds instant anonymous transfers with possibility to park money without counterparty risk in USD or EUR is the way to go... but we will see. For now the price has risen 300% since the article came out.
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:51:47
As horrible as Fiat is, it is more sustainable than PoW.
@_date: 2014-10-05 02:01:04
I think cryptocurrencies in total will never be worthless. But an outdated bitcoin surely will go to 0.
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:17:42
I think excellent news if the VAT has not to be applied to the principal. Then there would be no regulation as stated in this document and no taxes on sales of Bitcoins... I understand that in this case Mexico would be the place of choice for bitcoin related businesses...
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:47:26
Are you a professional miner? I would understand that you are not in favor of this change... your equipment would be worthless from one day to another... But for the majority of miners it is something they do even having losses out of love to the community... only very big miners with excellent efficient hardware can really get a small profit out of this operation.
My impression is that here we have a collision of established interests, which seems like the collision of interest between banks and mined Bitcoins, now between mined Bitcoins and non-mining BlackCoins.
If you read the wikipedia article of this thread one can really see numerous advantages of the PoStake protocol vs PoWork protocol. On really all levels....
But ok, if the Bitcoin miners want to stay with this protocol, they are the ones who decide I guess... I thought we had such a protocol which allowed us to adopt and implement new ideas if they are worth it... But in practice I think this will not happen... But ok, I think it is not that difficult for people who want to try PoS to buy the coins on the exchanges... or as diversification.
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:04:24
There is already a new generation... btsx, nxt, blackcoin and so on...
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:20:26
I think all knowledgeable miners will hate proof-of-stake... They would definitely be all out of business... Nothing against them... But this proof-of-work mining is not sustainable...
Also we could stop inflating bitcoin like blackcoin does
 For people who leave their wallet open to the network for transaction clearing they receive 1% interest per year and thats it...
I know that these would be really important changes, but it would be feasible... Though miners would want to stick to old version effectively creating a hard fork. Everybody who had positions in bitcoin would end up having them in both forks...
@_date: 2014-09-19 23:56:38
Look into PoS or better DPoS... there is no mining at all...
@_date: 2014-08-22 05:56:03
oh shit! :) I really hope there is no issue... now 90 minutes and nothing...
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:21:33
By sticking your head in the sand the design problems of Bitcoin will not disappear magically...
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:55:27

@_date: 2014-03-21 03:41:51
You cannot get people interested in this topic by saying: spend a 100$ for 0.15 Bitcoin and start using virtual currency. But if you say everyone in the US has a right to obtain a 100.000 US-Coins by sending in a copy of his id for free... that makes a huge difference.
Later they might just change to Bitcoin... But you would have 300.000.000 new users of Virtual currency... right now worldwide it is only a few million...

@_date: 2014-04-21 01:34:42
Yeah... the coin is very new... I hope they come out with better and better documentation. Peercoin uses PoW and generates new coins still like Bitcoin does, which I find not interesting. I really like the idea of PoS only, quick transactions and the need for the attacker to buy more than 50% of the actual coins.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:53:06
Selling because Bitcoin is too expensive and outdated compared to new technologies like bitshares-x which have a marketcap of 70 million instead of 6000 million like bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:37:45

@_date: 2014-07-12 23:48:01
In PoS-only coins like BlackCoin you can attack if you have 51% of all the coins. This would make the price skyrocket... so it is not really feasible in my eyes...
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:27:00

Do you think that with the market being as it is, it is of value to have a Diploma? I hear that in many places the majority of young people have to work in McDonalds or are unemployed... Perhaps taking a student loan and going to a casino is the better alternative as the economy is so screwed up...

Take a look at bitshares. They have solved everything. :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:16:03
If bitcoin keeps falling, perhaps the miners will deploy a bitcoin version with higher payouts... or Bitcoin security will have to scale down... A known flaw in the design of Bitcoin...

Why does everybody think that Bitcoin has to be the one and not some other coin? 2 hours for transfers and 500 million USD energy wasted in a year does not sound too good...
