Elon Musk is some overly promoted moron who's kept afloat not by hard work and grit, but by networks of [corrupt bureaucrats]( and abuse of slave-labor. He WOULD NOT succeed if left to his own merits (IE had to actually manage the projects without massive subsidies)

Why should anyone give a shit about what some selfish egotistical brat thinks?
