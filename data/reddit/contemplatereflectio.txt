I see it more as a way of exploring ideas on how to keep the network afloat in times of turmoil, e.g. governments deciding to mess with the internet in order to shut down bitcoin. What if you regard it in this light? Still useless?

It's a very interesting, albeit a bit long read. Going through all the links would probably take weeks but it's seems the most comprehensive timeline of the scaling debate that i've come across.

Ther can be problems with sending/depositing the same exact amount in a row. They even say to vary it so something like your case might've been avoided by listening to their advice.
I think everything will clear up, don't worry.

The claim that to *transfer bitcoins from one address to other* is the sole thing bitcoin is meant to do is not true. 
Even in the very first sentence from the abstract of [the whitepaper]( it says: 


(emphasis mine)
What would bitcoin be without that second part?

He is asked about a possible solution for Arnheim, which is struggleing with the current btc fees. Arnheim aka [Bitcoin City]( has one of the highest density of bitcoin merchants, which recently got the [100th merchant]( on board.

Haven't read anything like this over there. Do you have any examples?
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:46:55
Haven't read a lot of it myself, but reading more of it is a good idea.
There should be more discussions around quality posts/writings like this here.

fair enough.

How would the situation change if bch had the same number of transactions?


That seems to be a gross oversimplification. See:

BoC= Bank of Canada , a public bank as opposed to the private FED Edit:[Interesting Lawsuit against the BoC]( (basically to again provide interest free loans to the government for infrastructure projects/funding, which they did from 1838–1974 at which point they joined the BIS)
BIS= [Bank of International Settlements]( - ["the bank for central banks", "the worlds only commercial bank protected by an international treaty](
Stephen Poloz, beside being the governor of the BoC, is on the board of directors of the BIS. Other members of the board of directors are people like Mario Draghi and our dear Janet Yellen.

Was thinking the same thing today. Found out about scaling bitcoin 2017 through twitter and then posted the szabo &amp; ou talk you mentioned in your post. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:22:15
I've read some posts from there. But only more recent stuff. Didn't take the time to read more.
From the post you linked. As a non native speaker, something irks me about the structure of the sentence. 


The part in italics just seems off.
He is saying that moral instincs should not be regarded as higher or lower than other learned instincts, regardless where they are learned, right?
The part you quoted is great. Made me think of the news that there will be a market for bitcoin futures. 
What makes this particular post your favourite? What's your takeaway from it?

Finished reading Shelling Out two days ago. It was a very interesting read, but the writing style was at times confusing to me. Szabo is by all means a great thinker, but it seems to me that his ability to get his ideas across is lagging behind. That's also the impression i got from listening to the talk i posted.
What do you think?

Have you seen this? [All of the worlds money and markets in one visualization.](
I think it does great job at visualizing the problem with derivatives.
