If it wasn’t painfully obvious my initial comment was sarcastic, as I’m assuming the previous one was, I’ll use /s next time

Shilling your bags in other coins subreddit isn’t a good look for a project (and I’m not even a BTC maximalist)

A tip - transfer a very small amount, delete the wallet and try recovering from your seed, then send it back to Coinbase to check you’ve got the right address and to be 100% sure you can access it even if your wallet file corrupts or you lose your laptop/phone etc.  
Your our own bank so responsible for keeping it safe, good luck!

Wouldn't they have to open channels making the transactions on chain anyway?

What have you just seen

Evening Standard is a free paper, mainly distributed on London public transport
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:49:13
Bakkt was actually announced a few months before the Whitepaper was published

This isn’t anything to do with Libra or Facebook other than it slipped through their filters. It’s a scam
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:45:23
@_date: 2019-08-03 12:40:30
How are posts like this not deleted?
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:37:37
This is 100% a scam it looks like and sorry but I don't think you'll get any of your BTC back

Words like ‘threat’, ‘competing’, ‘shitcoin’ I don’t think help. 
(I’m not suggesting you’re deliberately pushing any agenda here) 
Wouldn’t it be better if the crypto community was a lot less devided? Yes there are projects that at best have no value and at worst are solely designed to defraud, but co-operation on projects of value, rather than trying to discredit everything but the coin you’re holding bags in surely is a better option
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:03:50
But it’s not anything to do with Libra, it’s a scam
@_date: 2019-08-03 12:20:02
Yep, Credit cards can’t be used for that kind of thing as it’s seen as irresponsible to be gambling with someone else’s dollar ��
@_date: 2019-08-18 10:22:25
Yeah I’m not saying it’s ‘one side’, it’s everyone ����‍♂️  
On a side note - how would BTC fulfil that without any kind of on chain contract function? 
And where’s the advantage of working to fix ETHs shortfalls rather than trying to hammer BTC into every usecase?  
(This is what I’m trying to put across that the space should be more co-operative)
Portfolio disclosure I’m currently 90% BTC, 5% ETH, 2%BNB and other smaller hotdogs
@_date: 2019-10-17 15:55:53

When it comes to financial markets I think a lot of it is a joke. You can trade corn futures without any intention of ever seeing a farm or a bushel of corn, capitalist abstract is amazing
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:26:36
This is a terrible idea

Surely driving money launderers and criminal users away from mainstream platform is a good thing?

You can’t buy stocks, or gambling accounts, or lottery tickets - this is usual for credit cards and not a sign that Apple is ‘cracking down’

This uses nothing at all. Showless.

That’s a dangerous principle to rest on it as someone *may* have the key, if funds move from that wallet that doesn’t degrade the secure ness of the system

Create your own DND style. 
Create your own ‘algorithm’ assigning dice values to BIP39 words and roll away, creating a much less easy to spy on seed phrase generation
