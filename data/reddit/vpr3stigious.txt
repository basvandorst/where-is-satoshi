So wrong.  You can have a chain of blocks getting rewarded only to 1 miner if only 1 miner has all the hashing power. Lots of people (a network) can still transact, but with only 1 miner. The blockchain is the ledger, stored only on that 1 miners computer.

In a way, id say youre too late. The future of altcoins is very uncertain. Crypto will definitely not vanish but the ability to profitably mine using gpus is much more uncertain. Ive been successful, having reached ROI of 1200£ and now mining above the graphics card depretiation rate. 
But i started several months before the bitcoin bubble runup and a lot of my returns can be attributed to that. This is certainly not the case now and many miners are mining less than their electricity costs. its possible if youre lucky and the future markets work out but i would expect to lose money overall by getting into gpu mining right now.

So Satoshi Nakamoto did not create a blockchain abd actually created a database... Or did he create a blockchain on which he was the only miner? 
No one said an undistributed ledger is powerful. Of course its not. So therefore thats a crappy and centralized blockchain. Blockchains dont have to be decebtralized to be blockchains.

I support btc, but this is what a true free market (supported by the btc libertarians) leads to: huge market control by a monopoly. Even if consumers technically control what pools they mine on and who they buy asics from the power of already having market power leads to further centralization of that market power. Bitmain and Amazon are prime examples. Antitrust regulation to manufacturers of asics need to be applied globally to stop this risk to the btc network.

Gotcha. Thought you were saying theyre mutually exclusive like the commentor seems to think.

The ledger is the blockchain. 
The ledger can be centralized in few places or decebtralized in many. 
Therefore, the blockchain can be centralized or decentralized. Call a highly cebtralized blockchain a database if you want, but its still a blockchain. Just crappy.

Many cloud mining groups are scams, so be careful. Check withdraw conditions. Read terms and conditions. Dint compound invest because then you can lose everything at once. Not at akk interested :)

Time for someone to make a tamagochi shaped hardware wallet which only lets you access your coin if you keep your tamagochi well fed (instead of a key)?

Proof?

Yeah see you have NOT provided proof of this. 


If you say it is worthless because it is only worth something provided people agree it is, then you are saying that *literally everything in the world* is worthless since everything in the world has value given by people agreeing on it. And I would agree. Anything and everything has no intrinsic worth or value because humans have decided upon those values. You are saying this as if its some sort of revelation. Obviously fiat is in intrinsic terms worthless, and so is bitcoin. In non-intrinsic terms, fiat is clearly not worthless, and neither is bitcoin.

UKIP? seriously? They would easily voten favour of big corporations and banks but pretend to have an antiestablishment, no bullshit platform. Theyre actually a party of people dissillusioned about politics (fairly enough) but manipulate that and people poor education to blam3 everything n immigrants and the establishment. Hypocrites.

America only for this, right? I hate how that's not mentioned (as if it is assumed).

Good to hear.  A clear tax understanding of cryptic legitimizes it.  I'm in the UK.
