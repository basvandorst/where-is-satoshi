It is that easy, but you have to factor in the fee prices, either from the exchange you're buying, or to move it around.
Also consider that if you buy it now, it could take 10 minutes or 10 months to be higher enough to profit, or never be profitable... and while you wait it can go down, down and down enough to scare you to sell and not lose even more, just before it goes up again.
So, it is that easy, but it comes with all that wait and stress that some can handle while others can't

Good luck on that since these are **NOT** Bolivars thrown away on the streets of Caracas, in fact, it's not even Venezuela.
This is in Brazil on elections week and these are leaftlets talking about candidates and its respective voting numbers to put on the voting machine.
I dont have the source on this exact photo, but you can read "Escola Municipal" on the wall instead of "Escuela Municipal" (Portuguese/Spanish) and also a famous brazilian payphone design by one of its largest carrier "Oi". 
Check other examples [here](
EDIT: And OP knows that, since he's Brazilian

Yeah, me too, everywhere the subject mentions bitcoin, either in class or in a bar

adjective (of a person) not identified by name; of unknown name
You don't need to tell everyone your (real) name, and I highly doubt he'll ask for any sort of ID, basically the definition of anonymity, but I do understand that you mean "someone saw you do it"

Do you know how to spot a vegan? Just wait, they'll tell you!
As vegans have a tendency about telling they are vegan, those who have or understand (at least a little) about bitcoin also tend to talk about bitcoin, so whenever the subject about bitcoin comes, they all look at them

That's what I wanted to know, if I need any ID verification to use bitpanda
