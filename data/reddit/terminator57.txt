Bitcoin is a bit unknown to most people so at first it might be a bit tricky. 
But a useful service like this will help on raising awareness to the general public and then curiosity will kick in and learn more about blockchain technology, decentralization, transparency, private keys, transactions e.t.c.
App review showing how it works: 
Description: 
Bitfortip offers a unique use case thanks to Bitcoin.
Use Bitfortip to:
Find a item (i.e. a dress ) that you saw on a magazine,website, Pinterest or Instagram and you don’t know where to buy it online. You can upload it as photo using your smartphone and ask bitfortip members to search it online for you in order to win the bitcoin reward.
Find a better price for an item that you want. Offer a small Bitcoin reward for members to search for you online.
Find a piece of information on the internet that you can’t find on your own. Post an inquiry along with a bitcoin reward for people to find you a certain link, image, e.t.c.
The name BITFORTIP comes from 3 words.
Bit = Bitcoin
for = for
Tip = information/tip

After you fund your account, you can post an inquiry with a bitcoin reward of your choice.

Tip a little bitcoin at bitfortip.com to give the incentive for people to search for you online.
Some use case examples below.
You saw a dress on a magazine,website, Pinterest or Instagram and you don't know where to buy it online. You can upload it as photo and ask bitfortip members to search it online for you in order to win the bitcoin reward.
Or let's say someone wants to get a specific smartphone and after his own online research, he has found it for $500. He then offers a reward of 0.000139 BTC ($0.08) if someone can find it even cheaper, say $480. Then the person who finds it, is rewarded with 0.000139 BTC and the inquirer saves $20.
Or if you are unable to find an information on the internet on your own. You can post an inquiry along with a bitcoin reward for people to find you a certain link, image, item e.t.c .
The amount of the Bitcoin reward is being determined from the inquirer. Minimum amount required is 0.0001 BTC. Roughly $0.06 with the current bitcoin price. ( bitcoin price can be calculated here  )
When you sign up, a unique bitcoin address is generated in your account. There it shows you the following message: Before you can submit an inquiry you need to funds your account at least with 0.0001 Bitcoin to give as a reward. After you fund your account, you can post an inquiry with a bitcoin reward of your choice.
A nice animated video can be seen here that explains how the site works :

Nice ones!Thanks.

Yes, she wants to buy the same one and can't find it online. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 05:32:27
You can ask whatever you like.

It's live for 1 year as an app . 3 years as a website.
It has also being displayed at TNW 2017 exhibition.
Current problem is that not many people own Bitcoin and those who do want to HODL + current bitcoin fees, which I hope will get lowered with LN ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:33:33
Hello, yes. When you sign up, a bitcoin address is generated automatically with 0 BTC balance. If your answer is marked as correct by the inquirer you will see your account credited.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:59:40
No, Just that it won't go again below 9K.
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:24:10
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:59:17
exactly ;) chances are we won't see it again
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:07:15
Bitfortip is not a faucet. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 15:35:11
Show her bitfortip.com ;) That might spark her interest.
She saw a dress on a magazine,website, Pinterest or Instagram and she doesn't know where to buy it online. She can upload it as photo along with a bitcoin reward and ask bitfortip members to search it for her online.

I have made a bitcoin website where you tip people with a little bitcoin to find you a better price deal or for an info that you can't find on your own.
