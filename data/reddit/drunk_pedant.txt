But is there really that much infrastructure that we couldn't just change it?

The problem is that some people invest all their savings. When bitcoin crashes, they can't afford food or to pay for bills. Sure, bitcoin will probably rise again, but sometimes you need food and shelter before that happens. Those who make these jokes about hodling if it crashes are, I suspect, mostly high school to college aged students who's parents will take them in if they are about to die. Believe it or not, but a lot of people don't have parents to fall back on. We will likely become homeless with a large crash if we put our savings in it. 
Invest what you can afford, unless you still live with your parents. Then I suppose you can afford to invest everything you have.

And yet you downvote me. fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:07:09
I hope BTC crashes and your whole family, including your small children, become homeless from your greed. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:06:23
wtf, I never even mentioned bch. Clearly you are not a trustworthy person to discuss this with, since you interpret any question about bitcoin as bch shilling, even if no one mentioned bch.

Once again, Reddit misinterprets me. Good job

Not only that, but unemployment would skyrocket. For those who support a crypto revolution, how are we going to control employment in a recession? The central bank does this by moving interest rates, but with no interest rates to control, we will just have to face the unemployment that a recession brings us. 
Ironically, if you want to see what would happen without a central bank in a crisis, look the Greece. Greece was not like Spain, the US, Ireland, or Iceland. Their crisis came not from private banks, but from high public spending and no monetary tools (since they were part of the EU). Without monetary tools, they couldn't devalue their currency to boost exports or control inflation with interest rates.

I'm not as active in this community, so I don't understand why everyone thinks this. All the evidence I read is circumstantial. Am I missing something? To use an analogy, if I see smoke, I don't immediately assume fire.

I don't understand this whole segwit problem. Just transfer out of GDAX. Everyone except kids should be using GDAX, and frankly, you shouldn't be investing if you are under 18. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:10:22
How about a coin like IOTA?

I upvoted this.

Is all negative news FUD?
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:52:44
What? I downvoted you because this is a low effort post. One word? Get out of here. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:08:21
Literally never mentioned bch. You don't seem like a rational person, since you interpreted my vague question as bch shilling. Literally never mentioned bch. You are too paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:28:25
Hmm. From what I gather, you are a 38 year old, 300lb, 5'7" father of 3. You might have went to school in UW-Madison, you own a Dodge, and you used to work at Auffenburg Dodge in MO. You seem progressive, as you have criticized trickle down economics a lot. I'm like you. I think trickle-down is BS, so high-five there.
What's odd however, is that you seem very comprehensible and reasonable on Reddit, but you revert to a hormonal middle schooler on any post related to cryptocurrencies. Like in your bitcoin posts, you say "lololol," reference memes, and act like a general asshole. Why is that? Perhaps crypto is actually toxic. Perhaps money is toxic. Kudos on being a hodler since 2015 though! you must be loaded now! 
After finding out more about you, I am less angry. But you probably don't care and want me to die. Well, if it's any consolation, I'm clinically depressed and have attempted suicides a few time. Maybe the next time you will get luck! 
Sorry if I appeared like an asshole to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:05:35
I downvoted you
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:05:20
Ya I would, but I'm asking for an argument other than "it's been good to me. Have faith. It's the original." I'm trying to pick which coins to invest in, not what god to believe in. Being "good to me" isn't a financially-prudent criteria for investing.

Complaining about insider trading is how you get regulation. Can everyone get of their high horse. You KNOW that if you could insuder trade, you would. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. You are only angry cause you didnt get the chance to insider trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:58:59
Read my first post. This is like my 14th Reddit account. I constantly delete and remake accounts. Tell me what reasonable proof I would need to convince of this and I will supply it. If no proof would convince you of this, then you are a retard. 
Also, for fuck's sake why don't you just say I am causing unwarranted fear? Wtf must you use the word "FUD"?!!? OMFG it's like I'm in a high school lunch room. Speak adult for fuck's sake. 
I literally don't understand this. Do you think actual investors - you know, adults who have a job and have moved out of their parent's basement - just cry manipulation? No. If the market goes down, they trade. They take responsibility for their choices. They don't just make ad hominems. But that's even besides the point. Why aren't you engaging in FUD against the enemy if you feel it is so effective? Do you just morally oppose it? Ya sure. It's because FUD doesn't actually do anything to the market, and you just want a scapegoat. 
My God, you make me so angry. And I know you don't care. This is the world we live in. Shitlords like you just want the world to burn. 
You know what adults do when people shit on their investment choices. NOTHING, BECAUSE THEY ARE FUCKING ADULTS.

Finally, THIS is the type of answer I'm looking for. Not all these, "its the original coin blah blah" arguments.
Can you further elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:18:41
That's implied. Would you rather I have written "Coinbase's vanilla platform? Use Coinbase's GDAX platform." Too superfluous. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:44:39
My question is why are you guys even using Coinbase? Use GDAX. It's free. 
My thought is that most bitcoin holders on Reddit are between 12-18, and so they unlikely have the necessary information to set up a GDAX (e.g. multiple IDs, asked their parents for an SSN, etc). Some of you might have a different circumstance, but the majority surely are within 12-18. 
But as OP said, Coinbase is huge. It's also mainstream now. Not only that, but most of the credible traders (e.g. the people who own at least 1 full BTC) probably have access to GDAX. 
Coinbase isn't lying imo. It's just that this sub is a bubble, where you get tricked into thinking the majority of crypto holders follow Reddit's distribution.

Wellbutrin has been recommended to me, but I'd rather wallow in my sorrow. Seems like humanity is full of assholes, so why should I better myself for them. Many people say, "it's your life. Don't let the assholes get to you." Well, perhaps a world full of jerks isn't worth living in. Kind of off topic for this thread, haha.
