My advice is to do what the academics have been saying for over a decade now: Passive strategy.
You buy the S&amp;P500 or equivalent broad market index (in the form of ETFs or Passive management funds), mix it with some risk free bonds to get the risk level you want and that's it.
It's the only investment strategy I can recommend to anyone with good conscience.

Gold has intrinsic value because it can be used for jewelry and industrial purposes. The intrinsic value however is far below the current value.
The millions of dollars in silicon and steel aren't backing the value of the BTC in any way. 
It's completely different from the way the US economy backs the USD.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:09:34
Gold parity is completely meaningless when we're comparing it with a currency (virtual or real), because the currency has no physical weight.
All that matters is the relative change in value, not the absolute value.

Actually people did do that. Then they borrowed against the value appreciation of their house, and lived on that. 
A fine strategy if you have an asset that increases 10% in value per year and that you want to live in.

Reminds me of people who were quitting their jobs because housing prices would always increase 10%+ per year.

You don't need to diversify across the entire investment universe to gain most of the diversification benefits.
So if you're looking for alpha gains, just diversify across 20 or so assets that you think will give the most excess returns. If you can't find that many positive alpha assets, just buy the market index and overweight the positive alpha assets.
The only cost here is that you can't put everything into the asset you think will give the highest excess return. This opportunity cost almost always pales in comparison with the diversification benefits.

It's the best word to describe a group of financial assets I can think of. But I understand your point.

We're not talking about the philosophical concept of intrinsic value, but the financial one. Call it "fundamental value" if you will.

Not surprised to find nonsense like this on Risk has everything to do with money. Two portfolios with the same expected returns but different levels of risks will have different values. The less risky portfolio will be more valuable than the risky one. 
In other words, by diversifying my portfolio, I reduce risk because of how statistics work. And by reducing risk, I increase the value of my portfolio. This means that on average, the diversified portfolio will outperform the undiversified portfolio. There will always be the odd lucky undiversified portfolio that hits the jackpot, but most of them will underperform.


This is absolutely true. So are you saying that people on have absolute knowledge of the future price of bitcoin and hence they don't need diversification?

If you invest in bitcoin, you're basically saying that you think there's a significantly larger chance that it will go up than go down. But because of the high variance, there's still a fucking huge chance that it goes down.
However, assume you have 1000x bitcoin style investment opportunities, with huge independent variance, and a significantly higher chance of profit than loss. In this case, diversification would mean that you're essentially guaranteed to make money. Some investments would go down, but most investments would be profitable on average. It would be an almost riskfree source of significant returns, and thus very valuable.
A portfolio with diversified across 1000 bitcoin style investments would be much more valuable than a protfolio only invested in one bitcoin style investment opportunity.

If a majority of your assets are in bitcoins, you better sell most of them and fast.
A lot of people are going to get burned on this thing (even if there's no massive collapse to zero) because they don't understand finance and risk management.

Which is why I've been saying all along that even if they make money it's all luck not skill. And for that reason they should stay away.

Well you have to include inflation. Buying a boat for $20K in the 80's and going around the world isn't the same as doing it today.
The fact is that seaworthiness of sailboats hasn't improved very much either during that time.

Yes you can, and people did this in the run up to the housing bubble. As your property increases in value, you can take loans against this higher value. As long as the house keeps appreciating, this strategy works just fine.
You have to remember that past performance is an irrelevant indicator for the future in efficient markets. Real estate markets aren't all that efficient, but to a lesser degree, this rule still applies. You can't put your faith in past price development.
The price of a house isn't destined to increase much over the long run in real terms. The long term returns from real estate stem from the housing services a house generates, either to yourself or to renters, not price appreciation.

So essentially the same as lottery then? An investment (gamble) that if repeated n times would result in loss, but with luck you might make it big if you invest once? I'm sure some of them are like that, but hardly all of them.

Oh come on. US treasuries is one of the most popular investment vehicles out there. Combining the S&amp;P500 (or similar index) with the US treasury to get the risk level you want is the single wisest investments one can make if you're not a professional investor (passive investing).


It was because of luck you dumbass. It's like a lottery winner claiming his purchase of a lottery ticket was a smart investment.

Diversification increases portfolio value at almost no cost. Not diversifying is throwing away money, in other words, diversifying is picking up that money for free*.
*Not including extra transaction costs which amount to next to nothing.

It's like an amateur poker player who does stupid class but still beats everyone simply due to luck. It doesn't work out well in the long run. Luck runs out eventually and probabilistically smart decisions average to a win.
Plus, I think it's the bitcoin owners who are the losers here.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:29:49
Diversifying your portfolio is essentially free value to your portfolio. So not doing it, is throwing money away.
Successful diversification leaves you with only market risk. The majority of invested money is diversified, which means that non-market risk is completely dismissed when valuing assets. This leads to higher asset prices (because only market risk is included in calculations).
Any non-diversified person, to whom non-market risk still matters, will be overpaying for financial assets if bought at market prices.

I'd tell him to buy with something ridiculously small like $50 (unless that's big for him), so he can enjoy the ups with you, and he can't laugh at you when the shit hits the fan.
Obviously you shouldn't let emotions like that play any part in investing, but the activity that goes on in this subreddit isn't investing.

An undiversified investment that pays a guaranteed $100 in a year is worth more than an undiversified investment that either pays $0 or $200 in a year (50:50 chance).
They both have the same expected return of $100, but the former investment has less risk.
Now, if you invest in 30 of the latter investments, and the variances amongst them are uncorrelated, then you will get be almost guaranteed to have an average payoff of $100/per investment.


It's a bad quote. It doesn't reflect what Warren Buffet has done.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:15:58
Unless you know for a fact (or a near fact) that one particular investment will make large gains, then diversified &gt; non-diversified.
And people like Warren Buffet who get special insight (read: insider info) because of his involvement in various projects, will still diversify, because there's always that slight chance that everything goes to hell.
I don't think there's really any legal situation where anyone could be recommended to put all their money on one undiversified investment. Not even US treasuries.

If you're undiversified, it absolutely does. It seems most people here don't understand how risk relates to the calculation of value. If you've only taken finance 101, then know atleast that higher risk increases the required return on capital (the discount rate). A higher discount rate means future cash flows (payoffs) are worth less.

Never give your friend's investment advice (except in general terms, like diversify etc).
If the advice turns sour you could ruin the friendship, regardless of whether the investment failed due to bad luck or bad advice.

It depends on how many bitcoins you have. If you have half a bitcoin then you can measure you wealth at the spot price.
If you have 100 bitcoins, then you need to take into account the fact that the market will work against you when you try to sell, giving a lower price than the spot.

None of those are reasons enough not to diversify. An undiversified portfolio is like throwing money away.

And reducing risk without reducing expected return (you can reduce it some) creates value. Why? Investors don't like risk without reward! The expected payoff needs to rise as risks rise. Otherwise people do not want to invest (which causes the price to go down until the expected payoff is large enough).
This wikipedia article explains the whole thinking behind it:
