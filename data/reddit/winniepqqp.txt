Good question. Just buy, no sell....

So, according to the "dickline" BTC will be soon 1000000$. But what will BTC be worth if USD equals to toilet paper? Not much... maybe a used car? 2 pay checks??

Is the code open source? 
I'd like to contribute.

So, 1 BTC will be worth 1000000 USD one day?  
Maybe we should start using another unit of account until BTC is the new unit of account.

Isn't it possible to use both by keeping all the BTC on the legacy wallet and send new funds to the new segwit wallet? Switching between them as needed... 
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:59:30
Based on the current production cost per Bitcoin 1.5K would be a steal!!  
What would a price of 1.5K mean in the mid- and longterm?

We should all start using bitcoin as a currency. This will help to get the transition into BTC layer 2 stuff. Buy using BTC and re-buy used coins using your fiat currency.
Noobs learned _it's too expensive to move digital gold_. We all can prove it's not. 
HODL is good and bad at the same time.

Yes, absolutely. 
 
One may answer to this: _Mining is not profitable these days._ 
I would then say: _History has shown that even minded coins with a little loss turned into high profitable coins in the future. Just hodl the coins for later. Further more, more miners using different pools help decentralise mining._

It's not only BTC that is falling at the moment, have a look at the stocks, for example S&amp;P 500. 
I'm not intersted in stocks, so I buy BTC. ✌️

I know, but what if Ledger Wallet would integrate a backdoor? The bitmain miner has such a backdoor, see

Bitcoin has low transactions fee as well (at the moment). 
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:32:03
How should we do this with Hardware wallets like  Trezor or Ledger Nano S??

Uber: "Regarding the btc payment, it is not available at this time. Our teams are always working hard to develop our services, so I hope I'll be able to bring you a good news soon. Please note, you can still pay with a credit card " 
AirBnB: No answer.
online store: An introduction of crypto currencies as payment options is unfortunately not planned at this time. Let's see what the future brings (but they sell Ledger Devices.) 
local food court: no answer given
barber shop: Maybe later. 
forgot to mention a software licence and for my yoga class. software licence: no answer and yoga was "No".

Not sure about the 1000.\-/year cap.
Yes, the fees sucks, but it's a super easy way to get in touch with Bitcoin for the first time.
It demonstrates that everybody that is able to buy a train ticket \(and has e Swiss mobile number\) is able to buy BTC. It builds trust as well because it runs on the  Federal Railways machines. The high fees \(equal to a Credit Card\) is worth it from my point of view  ;\)

I got in contact with BTC in 2013, in 2014, in 2015 and in 2016. I got in in 2017 during summer time. 
You all could imagine that I would love to turn back the time and get in earlier. However.
My problem was not a technical problem. I dropped out earlier. I had nobody around me, a real person, that could have introduced me to BTC and give answers to my questions. At this time I had no reddit account and so on. 
What you all can do is to help people around you  to install a wallet (Samourai or Eclaire works as  regular wallet as well) and send them BTC for 5 USD. What will happen?
They will start checking the BTC price on a daily base and start to inform themself, start asking more question and tell that they have BTC on the mobile to all their friends. 
BTC is addicting and spreads like a virus. :-)

Agree. Everybody is getting fooled by not paying attention to the little `*` from time to time. 
Further more. If I work for Bitcoin or sell goods and services for Bitcoin, this value is not reflected in the market cap.
