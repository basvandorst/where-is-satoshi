How does alice keep 3 parts if she gave 3/5 to the borthers and 1 in the trust?

None of those hold $1 Billion like, ex. coinbase's private key.

Jaxx/coinomi is a new wallet for each person, I want to have one master key for everyone's accounts (which only I control).

What's actual 2FA? Multisig and shamir have similar security characteristics

They don't know anything about anything, and I am storing all funds in an extremely secure air-gapped live-cd-based cold wallet for everyone, as well as making trades on their behalf in and out of various alts. 
I want the funds to stay separate so I know who has what without having to manage some excel file, and for each person to be able to  monitor their own account on-chain.

Thanks for that answer and link, I thought it was a bit simpler now.

Using signal is interesting


Yes, in a sense - but this is already about the paper backup. I don't want to have a single point of theft that can compromise everything, so I'm looking to add 2FA. To spend I will need the paper portion in my safe, as well as the second half from my phone/2FA. This is mainly a savings wallet with little spending.
As you hint, however, this highly increases the chances of loss, so there is a second layer, using shamir again, but this time spreading it around multiple friends/family/safety-deposit-boxes. This is extremely inconvenient to spend, but guards against loss, while the 2FA strategy lets me spend when I need, without having a single point of failure.

That's a fair suggestion, but I want them to be able to check their funds directly on chain. It also makes management harder for me, because I have to keep track of all the individual accounts for each coin.

The *expected* trade-offs - in practice the costs might end up being lower, and the benefits higher.

Work on it together? I'm an engineer.

Yes that's what I want, but with bip44 I have to give them a separate public key for every cointype, rather than 1 pretty key that has all their alts:
/btc/pubkey1 (for bob)/
/eth/pubkey 2 (also for bob)
/rep/pubkey 3 (also for bob)
Instead of:
/bob's pub key/btc
/bob's pub key/eth
/bob's pub key/rep

They feel it is too much to learn to acquire, manage and secure 20 different alt wallets, as well as figuring out exchanges and finding liquidity etc. A real expertise is still required to do it all right. We also have documents of their holdings in case I die.

What is "real" 2FA! :-)
Multisig is fine, it's the same, still have to secure the multiple sigs.
