All that matters for centralization is mining or otherwise validating nodes, and on that regard Bitcoin is already super centralized, whereas proof of stake will turn every coin holder into a potential validator.

Is OB going to support other currencies than Bitcoin?

ETH *is a platform to build smart contracts, decentralized aplications and organizations* on their blockchain. All those have to use ether to run, hence ether's value. Ethereum's architecture makes it much more suitable to build financial products and IoT, whereas with Bitcoin people trying to achieve the same goals *have to work around* Bitcoin's protocol.
XMR is the first *trully private* cryptocurrency. Privacy is so important and has been so neglected in most other cryptos that even with a small budget and team of developers, Monero has already a very significant market cap and volume.
Edit: I switched XRP with XMR.. AFAIK Ripple shouldn't even be on that list, since it is more like a company and not decentralized at all, but I don't know much more about it.

Not the case with most (if not all) other cryptocurrencies! They are just as irreversible as Bitcoin payments.

What I meant is develop an Ethereum wallet and put it in the same app, using the same backup seed. Also have the Shifty btton embedded so that users can move funds easily between currencies.
Jaxx is already a cross platform, dual currency wallet, and it works pretty
 well for an app that has been out there for just about a month now.
It would be great if Morero could be included as well!

Hi Rassah, is Mycelium considering supporting Ethereum as well? Jaxx is doing a very good job at becoming the dual wallet of choice, but I think you guys have had a great head start and probably have a better product in terms of stability and security. It would be great to see Mycelium embedding the Shifty button!
Also, how is coinjoin coming along? I remember you guys were working on it, but haven't heard about any developments yet.

Why not use Shapeshift.io in and out of Monero?
