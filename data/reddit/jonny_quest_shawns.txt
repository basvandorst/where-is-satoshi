I'm new and all I know it's real hard to determine which sub-reddit on cryptocurrency has an unbiased moderater.

Also, if you want coin quickly in your account from funds of your personal bank, use your debit card on Coinbase and then you can seamlessly move the coin to GDAX for transactions.  You can also have a USD balance in your GDAX folder for instant buys of the coins they support.

I think your comment just made this thread of original post my favorite. (For right now, until I start a new thread)
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:24:39
Don't make the same mistake I did. When you sign up for a GDAX account, don't click on "create new account ", click on "login" and then use the same email and password as your Coinbase account.  Otherwise you'll have a new Coinbase account with this GDAX account, which will not have access to the coin in original Coinbase.

Come to think of it I was holding some BTC that day of the hard fork. I need to find that address and see how much BCH I have. I'm guessing about $20 bucks at current market.

No, I'm the idiot!
I forgot to bring my coupons to Kroger, Dammit!
Wait, wrong sub-reddit I think.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:26:42
It already did that on August 1st. And it is called BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:24:56
Yep. 0.5 BTC   right?

It's a perfect question. It raises the fundamental question of what gives a "currency" value. Salt had intrinsic value and was a currency many years ago, the same today with cigarettes in prison (movies, tv ?). If you go to gold.org you would find a list of high tech uses for gold. But gold has developed in different cultures a perceived value that differed widely. Think the Spanish and the Aztecs, Incas. Just like government issued treasury notes, a faith of mutually agreed upon perceived value of a token is required for it to be used as currency.
 And I agree with the OP that currency's real value is its ability to move freely and easily and represent a mutually agreed upon perceived value for purchase of commodities that have intrinsic value.  (Like something you can eat.)

Are you kidding? Where's the pump? 
Funny, that's what I was thinking. It had actually been climbing the week before "the big event", started dipping down a couple days before. And on the day and day after (today) it has been "dipping "(?) more. I have a little bit of bcash left from the 8/1 split. Almost sold it about a month ago when it was around $1600. I had remembered that it was around 1800 a week or so before that. So, I figured at least wait until May 15. Sell on what I thought would be an expected fever for at least a day or two. 
Right now its right under $1300. If I sold right now I could have 62 more bucks in my little checking account. 
Maybe like all festering infections, it takes time for the fever to start. 
Or not.
Still waiting for "the pump".

If you want to make it better, spend it, buy something with it. If you can't find anything you're willing to buy then sell something and accept only bitcoin. It is supposed to be a currency after all not a commodity. 
This hodl is starting to get old. People who like to think they are the true faithful believers to any cryptocurrency need to start USING it and stop looking at as an investment that they can live off of in the future by "chipping" off a little here and there for fiat. If you going only just do that, you'll  make more money (fiat) by making numerous daily buy and sell limits on an exchange. The  hourly volatility is exquisite.

Thank you.

I think this person my be a "victim". Looks like he/she is about to pay someone in the next few hours.
Maybe someone could lend some advice before this person gives away their life savings. I linked this post also over there.
@_date: 2018-10-07 02:15:37
Yeah, sure.
@_date: 2018-10-07 13:24:40
I know. 
The comments or responses I don't understand are the ones of you responding to harsh criticisms. You thank them and say nice things back. And ... stuff.
Are you sure you're on the right subreddit?
You make my brain hurt.
Seriously, I might just check it out when I get more bitcoin. I like it when people talking about bitcoin as a currency and not simply as an investment ("hodl").
Good luck. I think many people may be just jealous of your energy and enthusiasm. Like me, I still haven't crawled out of bed yet...
....because of your damn response to my sarcasm. Shit shit shit! 
Sorry, need coffee.

Why the downvotes? This correct if nitpicking.&lt;
I don't know. ;-( 
So, I upvoted you.

You didn't read the opinion piece at all by The Bloomberg columnist. 
The Bloomberg piece is showing that the Student/ Professor "paper"(from the University of Texas), on Bitfinex being able to influence market to any profitable degree, is dubious at best.
Now, I don't know if the Bloomberg columnist's math is correct, but you're "crying" about the wrong people.

Sorry meant "hodl".

Wow, got voted down for a bad pun(?) Or was it my question about the transaction fee? Non rhetorical BTW, actually curious. Bought many things with bitcoin ("grey market ") and with other alt coins. Just never chutney.  Yea, I'm little bit a bad boy, but at least I know what it's like to actually use a cryptocurrency as ... currency. 
And yes I hodl also, not just BTC.
I'm not wearing any jersey for any crypto currency.  Just been very curious about crypto/ public and private keys since Phil Zimmermann introduced PGP in the 90's. Somewhere I still have the Wired magazine that did a feature on him.
I have been reading a lot about the religiousosity between BTC and BCH, don't know enough to know which crypto god to pray to. But, I do know if one gets voted down just for asking a sincere question on a sub-reddit, than this may be one I should stay away from.
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:29:27
You can't hold too much, you have to find someone who has chips and accepts BTC (for all those "dips" you bought).
But seriously, I'm curious, what transaction fee did you incur and how much was the chutney?

Wow, I used to binge watch that show. Didn't catch the reference.  Too many episodes I guess. 
Now I want to get hooked again.

I actually have that song on one of the Spotify playlists I created, NarcoDelicAcy. Got the inspiration years earlier driving around listening to a college radio station on a Saturday. The young couple were clearly having fun. I think the song was sandwiched between Tony Bennett and Hendrix. 
Yeah, that's the song he sings when they are in the boat on the river of chocolate going into the tunnel.
