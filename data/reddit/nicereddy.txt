If I wasn't on mobile I would totally post :P

It'd be cool if they showed bitcoin donations in BTC, though I don't know how practical that would be.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:10:56
Maybe it could show BTC/USD? As in "1Ƀ/$100000", with the USD conversion being whatever the conversion was at time of purchase.

You're right bot, I have failed you. I am sorry.

Maybe make it something like this?

Not possible!

We need someone good with design so we don't end up with a gaudy orange website or something that looks unprofessional. Maybe we can get the person who did this infographic to help?

A few months/years ago Facebook login was forced. Thankfully that has since changed.
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:54:06
should be a thing for poor sobs like us.

Is the page protected to avoid biased (pro or anti-bitcoin, doesn't really matter) edits?
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:53:14
I just like the idea of bitcoins, unfortunately I have no bitcoins to pay you to help and I don't have any programming knowledge when it comes to websites, sorry! 
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:38:07
I'm also disappointed about the lack of Linux support, but unfortunately right now they're working on the Xbox One game so I doubt they had time to port.
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:19:49
I believe Microsoft had a similar problem with Sky Drive. I don't believe they allowed users to buy a subscription from the app because Apple would have taken a cut.

Technically that's not what he wanted, but close enough!

You get The Walking Dead as a single key and then all the Below the Average games as a single key.

This may be already in the app and I missed it, but is it possible to buy cards through the play store? I realize this isn't really relevant to bitcoins, but I don't know where else to ask.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:58:01
It's pink for me, seems there's some on the left side at parts as well.
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:30:31
Probably, see for a good example of good moderation.
The problem with this, though, is that the mods could simply delete every post critical of bitcoin in an attempt to raise the price and earn money.

It says in reddiquette that that's not how downvotes and upvotes should be distributed.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:37:14
Awesome! Thank you for the website.

If you guys need any help with running the games see the PCGamingWiki page for them!

I like how positive speculation gets upvoted but negative speculation gets downvoted.
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:31:43
I doubt publishers would go for that, but maybe if Valve just converts it into USD immediately it could work.
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:45:08
I have 56 games in my Linux Steam library, they're not AAA titles (other than Valve games), but I'm pleased with it.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:32:16
One day too late! I bought the bundle yesterday, definitely would have bought it using bitcoins had I had the chance.

Nope, it caps off at 21 million coins.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:58:17
There's probably a reason it was deleted, sorry.
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:44:10
You're more likely to get a response from the [Humble Support]( twitter.
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:45:14
I'd rather not be annoying about it. I buy just about every bundle so I'll just wait until next time.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:38:14
That's taken. How about LearnAboutPlanB.org?
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:09:52
"Humble Bitcoin Bundle"?
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:02:00
Nope, what is it?
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:42:44
Well, one day for me. I bought it yesterday and thus I don't want to buy it again.
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:37:39
Is it possible to donate to KA? And if so can we donate in bitcoin?
