Definitely a great idea with lots of potential!
I believe the key here is to build a base of motivated doctors to start with.
Most of my friends are doctors although not based in the US but I'd be more than happy to discuss this with them and see what chances this has of success.

I read a [Microsoft paper]( back in 2009 (won the best paper award) about some of the applcations of trusted timestamps (such offered by the blockchain) It might give you some inspiration.

bla bla bla..
basically every centralised entity arising from bitcoin/the blockchain has crapped out/been a waste of money. pointless altcoins, asic mining cos, bitcoin stocks, all the rest.
core, real, bitcoin itself remains a fantastic investment with massive upside, and will continue to be an incredibly useful in particular areas (darknet drugs etc)
All the corruption on the peripheries is expected and irrelevant. long live bitcoin.

I wouldn't call it regular but few of the clients I worked with at Odesk were keen to paying me in Bitcoin. So yeah, just ask and you might get lucky :)

I encourage everyone with interest in the overall story to actually read [the complaint]( It's astonishing.
It appears that these two Federal agents were doing far, far more than just grabbing some excess bitcoins that were lying around and they figured nobody would miss. It reads more like a purposeful organized crime effort, involving setting up dummy shell companies, forging letters from the government, being involved in pitching investments in shady offshore bitcoin startups, etc.
In fact, though they don't elaborate much, there is some implication that these agents may have been responsible for theft of bitcoin not only from Silk Road, but from Mt Gox as well. The complaint outlines how they transferred millions of dollars from Mt Gox, and then turned around and themselves signed Federal warrants seizing the assets of Mt Gox.
Reading this is thoroughly jaw-dropping, the kind of thing you'd associate with the government of a third-world country.

The Ulbricht case that went to trial was a different investigative team. [e.g. These agents were not involved]




However, I'm pretty sure the "murder for hire" trial is going to die quietly because of these agents.
