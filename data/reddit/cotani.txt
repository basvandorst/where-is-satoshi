 I didn't end up using their platform, but regrading funding - notice that they stopped accepting fiat currency from individual traders.

Coinbase looks great but as I wrote, unfortunately my residency don't fall under their listed countries so it's out of the question at the moment.

Yeah I'll do that after setting up an account with a new back. I was also trying bitfinex but they won't accept deposits from individuals anymore :/
edit: fiat funds, that is

Sadly in this case, I'm not a US citizen.

Who said it was bitcoin's fault? I said that the hurdles it takes to overcome in order to get INTO bitcoin are anchoring the whole system down and solving them would set bitcoin free.

Yeah I ain't planning on giving up, but I'm really wondering what's the drop rate in this funnel. 
I'll make sure to check Gemini and hold my fingers crossed for easier sailing in the coming future

looks interesting. I signed up to check out their platform. Thanks!

What iceberg do you see coming? Care to elaborate?

They were my first tries but unfortunately, my country isn't on their whitelist yet. Their process was actually pretty smooth but I was only notified that I can't deposit anything after setting up my account, which was really annoying. They could have said that when I picked my country in the profile.

Where did I write it's because of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:36:02
can't be worse than Kraken :D
