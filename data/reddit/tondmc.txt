OP is clearly pumping Alfa coin which clearly has no intrinsic value because it is controlled by a Fiat corporation.

TIL that Gibraltar now has the highest BitcoinATM density of any country on the planet @ 1 BATM per 30,000 people

Shareholders are definitely not anonymous but there are definitely major tax advantages.
And Gibraltar is about to offer regulation to DLT companies to make it easier for them to access restrictive markets such as the US

An alternative to method
We are setting up a Tontine Trust for Bitcoin (ANN next week).
You just put it all your bitcoin in and get some back every month or every quarter for the rest of your life. 
This way you don't sell too much, too early and if you live longer than everyone else then you will not just see the moon, you will probably be able to buy it.

Your method can work, no argument from me.


We will shortly be a fully regulated firm, potentially managing several billion within a few years, if we started keeping anyones coins we would be rightfully thrown in prison.
The main advantage our method has over yours is as follows;
If 1,000 redditors follow your instructions over a longer timeline (lets say 30 years), when it matures, only 800 of those redditors might be alive in which case theres a decent chance that 200 pots of bitcoin get lost.
In a tontine, if you are one of the surviving 800 then you now get 25% MORE bitcoin than you started with.

Actually, fully regulated by mathematics also which will be shown in the future. 


Well I respect your opinion completely and am very grateful, you have actually given me an amazing idea.

Not a rip off, more of a fork with reduced block rewards

Or maybe not a scamcoin actually.
One of our projects is actually aimed at securing retirement income on the blockchain, maybe thats partially why I was excited to see the reaction.

No intention of making fun of them at all. I was seriously impressed.

It occurred to me that it might have been his mum but I suspect the difference is more along the lines of taller people aging more gracefully

OP here: So I sat down to wait on some developers to catch a coffee when I overheard this lovely couple notice that an app/site they were interested in "was powered by Blockchain". He proceeded to read out and analyse the full wikipedia page with her. Gave me goosebumps.
