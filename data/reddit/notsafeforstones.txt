I'm guessing he's coding. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 23:34:11
There are definitely startups working on this, I'm too lazy to link for you all of them but they are out there.
[Abra]( is one of the higher profile startups.
Ideas are aplenty, execution is tough.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:43:34
Since you're new I'd go with coinjar.com.
It simplifies the whole process ie. one stop shop for wallet and trading services (simple buy and sell).  
The website is clean and intuitive enough for a beginner to learn the ropes of simple bitcoin transactions.  
Plus the security is pretty good once you enable 2 factor authorisation and you can add multiple devices. ie upto 5 factor authentication
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:14:35
Yeah Andreas mentions this quite alot, don't know how the OP gathered that information.
@_date: 2014-10-21 03:34:32
Absolutely. We all need it, most just don't know it yet.
@_date: 2014-03-13 08:58:40
The documentary 'Inside Job' narrated by Matt Damon would be a good start for you mister2au.  
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:02:44
It's really starting to feel like I'm going to have to explain to my kids that there was a time when sending money across the world was a complete pain in the ass.
They simply will not understand why.
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:45:31
Can't wait for my father and brother to read that article, better get my rebuttal ready ha
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:38:09
Any idea on how quickly the word is spreading in Brisbane? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 03:20:03
There's numerous threads around here asking the same thing.  
Don't do it, you'll only be wasting money on electricity and mining gear that will become obsolete within months.
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:15:14
Sounds like you've already made your decision.  Welcome aboard!
@_date: 2014-10-20 06:22:36
Anyone know if these guys are aware of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-22 05:56:42
Man I hope someone gets the videos up on youtube asap.
@_date: 2014-06-28 09:35:31
Do your research, he's been a speaker at alot of bitcoin conferences and has alot more knowledge than your average weirdo.
@_date: 2014-10-22 08:41:29
Get this into a tv commercial asap.  
@_date: 2014-07-30 06:31:26
Well atleast we won't have to wait long to test the idea that a currency crisis may help accelerate bitcoin adoption in that country.  
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:53:39
Don't worry, we'll update you when the tears flow over a $35 bill.  
@_date: 2014-05-18 00:18:40
But I'm already home...
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:42:52
I'm going to steal this. Take my money $1 @_date: 2014-01-13 04:45:24
You spend alot of time commenting on something you don't like.
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:02:09
If you have to sell for bills, rent or other living expenses, do it.  
If you don't need the funds for a year or two, just hold on.
Bitcoin is going to be bigger than all of us, it's only a matter of time.
You'll be alot less stressed if you have the aim of buying bitcoins for your retirement, not for next months rent.
@_date: 2014-08-01 07:14:47
I'm gonna go along with whatever he says after reading that wiki.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:59:36
There's about a million different wallets to choose from these days, but [blockchain.info]( is a good starting point.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:04:32
Look to the sidebar ---&gt;
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:17:44
Great stuff, just signed up.
@_date: 2014-06-30 10:00:17
Yeah go the paper wallet option and laminate then frame it.  And don't forget a copy of it in a safe somewhere.
I've done the same for my nephew.
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:08:50
Found this site a couple of weeks ago and for the first time in my life it was exciting to pay a $1200 electricity bill.
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:56:42
Oh noes he better stop being passionate about something because one redditor said so.  
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:26:36
Yeah I've been giving bitcoin to my nephew to spread around his school, the only problem is he won't buy any of his own and keeps asking me for more!
@_date: 2014-05-11 05:12:56
Yeah same problem.  
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:41:46
Well I used it to pay multiple bills before they closed, and now I'll continue to use it again.  
Thanks for the service guys.
@_date: 2014-12-11 09:51:52
You have to experience Bitcoin.  Here's 50 cents, connect your reddit account by collecting this tip and you're up and running. @_date: 2014-07-31 05:47:30
Sincerely thanks for your effort with this, I can only hope that Mr Lawsky actually reads it, let alone act upon it.  
Time will tell I suppose.
@_date: 2014-06-22 03:38:28
Pretty girls at a bitcoin conference, winning.
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:58:25
It'd be handy if you had a couple million dollars to get this party started then.
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:27:05
You missed the IBM news a couple of weeks ago? I'm too lazy to link the articles but they are around...
@_date: 2014-09-30 08:46:51
My plan is to go back to localbitcoins.com to buy off individuals again.  Pain in the ass and nowhere near as convenient but workable.
@_date: 2014-02-05 10:35:35
It's definitely there, I downloaded it today
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:27:37
How many spoons are there in your cutlery draw?
Equally as important.
@_date: 2014-08-05 21:34:33
The last few silk roads?  There's only been one other, and its Silk Road 2.  And yes the administrators either got scammed or ran away with the funds,  but in their defence they have actually managed to return most of the lost funds to the account holders.
@_date: 2014-12-30 22:00:58
Well when you do think of a better idea, be sure to  drop it on a cryptographic mailing list. It'll catch on from there I'm sure.
@_date: 2014-09-01 09:02:47
@_date: 2014-11-27 10:25:48
Well done, are you a trader or just dabbling?
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:53:39
I'll click on anything that's not purple.
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:40:59
Tis good.
@_date: 2014-06-29 02:34:51
I really hope that Russell has started to gather more information about bitcoin after this interview.  
It's right up his alley once he understands it.
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:39:03
Watch all the Coinsummit 2014 videos on youtube, lots of applications are being built right under your nose.
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:22:06
Definitely agree, the kids won't care about the power that bitcoin gives individuals, but they do care about looking cool!
Here's $5, spread that shit around your school. @_date: 2014-09-24 11:08:58
At what exact time and date will I be able to order one of these cards?  
I need it to show everyone at work so they stop laughing.
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:14:01
Because everybody wins if Bitcoin goes mainstream.   Have a donut. @_date: 2014-04-02 03:13:55
I just had a mate that transferred $2000 into his coinjar account at about 9am this morning. By midday the funds we're already shown on the filler page.
He's with nab so I'm sure that helped with the speed.
I've transferred thousands of dollars over the last few weeks and never had a problem so far...
@_date: 2014-06-13 11:36:09
I don't understand this.  If you really believe bitcoin is going to fail, why spend the time to tell people that when you could simply move your attention to something else that you deem more important.  
I'm sure your skills of logic and reasoning could be used to help humanity somewhere else.
@_date: 2014-10-22 03:09:39
C'mon fellow aussies let's make this happen.  My vote is in.
@_date: 2014-11-21 01:26:57
Hey that's cool, I've been a reader of Now I know for a year or so.   
He'll be getting a tip from me as soon as he gets that button up.
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:25:30
Yes. Jump on board once you've done your research. Take your time, watch some videos, read the articles and start converting your wealth over, in amounts you're comfortable with. This will naturally increase as you become more confident in the outcome of our current financial system.
@_date: 2014-09-30 08:22:05
Man that must be frustrating to all the staff at Coinjar.  
What a kick in the teeth.
@_date: 2014-11-19 11:34:42
Exactly. Have $1 on me. @_date: 2014-12-26 01:17:37
Well atleast you should be able to keep your bitcoin stash secret whenever the divorce happens.
Good luck.
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:51:59
Here you go.  Start learning JavaScript.
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:51:32
Yeah I've used an assortment of Australian websites like  to obtain bitcoin but have settled on Coinjar full-time since November.  
Never had a problem with it so far.
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:13:53
Finally! Thanks... do you know if the others are coming soon?
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:16:34
Time is your friend. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 08:50:08
Watched 95% of bitcoin related videos on Youtube.   Read every bitcoin related article I could find on internet. Dropped life savings of $8000 into bitcoin during October last year.  
It worked out ok.
Make your own decision and you'll sleep well at night.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:49:56
For what its worth I think you may be onto something, but unfortunately it doesn't matter because the information you're looking for is probably never going to be revealed.
Like aliens.
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:40:42
My mum, sister and wife are using bitcoin with a bit of help and prodding from me.  A year ago they would of laughed but now they think it's mildly cool.  
My family might be the exception at the moment but it's definitely gaining traction.
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:00:03
Spread that shit. 500 bits @_date: 2014-06-15 02:32:25
Here's your starting point.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:12:58
Well since you're new it's your turn to spread some tips.  Here's $2 to get you going.  @_date: 2014-07-20 09:50:21
Bitcoin confidence is increasing every day.
[Here's the Coindesk state of bitcoin report q2 2014.](
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:46:38
Yeah bitcoin rich, aus dollar poor.  By choice ofcourse!
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:19:09
Just tweet him this documentary. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 03:30:21
Hold those suckers, the best bitcoin related investment opportunities aren't even here yet, give it a couple of years and see what the industry has to offer.
@_date: 2014-06-29 07:59:34
Well I couldn't resist so here's a thread from r/bitcointhoughts posted by Charlie Shrem.
@_date: 2015-05-16 09:19:54
Yeah, and I think it answered your questions pretty much on the dot.  
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:22:17
Ha have a laugh and just assume everyone is 14.  
@_date: 2014-12-18 06:49:44
Yep, used them once and never returned.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:03:16
Best bitcoin related talk I've seen all year!
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:07:16
And the people paying bills in the thousands probably started by paying small bills.
We're choosing who to trust and accepting the responsibility that comes with that.
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:15:31
@_date: 2014-10-08 10:54:21
The best part is you can get the software and test this out for yourself, time and skills permitting ofcourse.
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:52:58
I'll pay you 500 bits to rethink this service. @_date: 2014-10-09 05:25:36
@_date: 2015-05-08 00:19:57
Have you read this book?
[Currency Wars, by James Rickards](
Outlines alot of the scenarios and what actually happens on the ground.  
Doesn't explicitly mention Bitcoin but helps you understand what the current problems are.  In my opinion
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:14:03
I think they only have a 1% buy fee at the moment and the wallet services are great.
@_date: 2014-11-13 07:42:41
The exact same thing happened to me, haven't been back since.
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:07:46
Just sell bitcoin with a tiny markup for your troubles.
@_date: 2014-09-08 00:56:19
Bitcoin just told me it doesn't give a shit.
@_date: 2015-05-16 06:24:35
Bitcoin, the *currency* is only involved to put the transaction onto the blockchain.  You could use one or a billion satoshi's if you wanted to, it doesn't matter. It would be just like any other regular bitcoin transaction, the only difference would be the extra information about the land title would be included.
Of course the land holders won't have to worry about any of this, I'm sure Factom will have user interfaces that will simplify all this down to a point, click, enter information, confirm, situation soon enough.
@_date: 2015-05-16 07:55:27
Okay looks like you're going to need some more background information on how Bitcoin works. 
[Here's]( the 5 minute version and [here's]( the 20 minute version.  Enjoy!
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:04:41
That's a ridiculously hard question to answer.  
We'll know in 10 years.
@_date: 2015-05-16 08:47:34
From the perspective of the guy who has the land title, I'd guess he won't be dealing with bitcoins at all, he'll pay Factom for the service of registering on a world wide ledger using whatever local currency is available.
@_date: 2015-05-16 09:10:02
Surely that second video answers all those questions.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:53:09
wow you are an angry man at the keyboard.
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:04:35
Haha so he should only link to itisike approved websites to maintain his credibility? 
@_date: 2015-01-28 07:42:55
As far as I know that's the reason why the Australian exchange Coinjar moved to the UK.  
Non-Australian exchanges do not have to charge GST.
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:23:40
@_date: 2015-05-16 08:53:54
[Here's]( what they advertise they're going to do.
Just found [this]( that explains it well.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:29:27
When is your next million dollar purchase scheduled?  Cheers 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:29:03
I've been using them for ages with thousands of dollars, never had a problem!
@_date: 2014-01-12 09:13:24
I don't know if I'm going blind but I couldn't find anywhere to encrypt with BIP38 like bitaddress.org.  Is that coming soon?
@_date: 2014-06-29 07:52:23
This discussion has been done to death on other threads, sorry I'm too lazy to find and link them.
But they are there, search through r/bitcoinmarkets
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:21:23
This book will tell you everything you need to know about moving the economy into cyberspace, the implications are enormous.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:27:27
I love the idea, sounds like you have the skills to make it happen too.
Remember how 21.inc was going to put a bitcoin miner in every electronic device?  Do you think doing something like that would basically be your idea coming to fruition?
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:30:47
Can someone close by just go check out the fucking farm!
The suspense is killing me all the way from Australia
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:42:38
Want to see some cognitive bias in action? Astrophysicists are doing it as we speak.
@_date: 2016-02-18 09:28:54
I'd give up, they've got a little bit of my btc stuck as a frozen balance.  I wrote that off months ago.
@_date: 2016-02-17 10:54:32
What's that sound? It's the sound of power leaving Washington.
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:44:57
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:23:46
Was this on anybody's radar?
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:27:35
C'mon you know what day it is!
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:49:42
I thought I did too. Gobsmacked.  
I can only imagine how exciting it's going to be once the pieces really start falling into place for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:01:55
Are you telling us that someone decided to send 11 btc to that company purely based on what the website claimed?
Surely not.
@_date: 2015-03-19 09:07:13
Just out of curiosity, does it really 'concern' you if a few people choose to admire a guy?
@_date: 2015-10-10 21:28:10
Thanks for laying out your arguments nicely, I don't know how you guys manage to type out responses to sanswork without punching the monitor multiple times.
@_date: 2015-03-04 08:11:39
Man that guy makes me question why we need politicians anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:10:36
Bitcoin is a protocol, companies are being built on that protocol.
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:43:35
I'd argue the price is unstable and unreliable, but that definitely doesn't describe the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-02-18 05:59:23
Definitely not legit, please don't give them your money.
@_date: 2015-03-17 09:03:12
Head injuries happen.
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:24:36
Well that's a tiny view of the bigger picture.
@_date: 2015-02-08 03:10:22
It's all in the [whitepaper]( have a browse.
@_date: 2015-02-15 00:25:14
Don't do it, you'll only lose money and wish you just bought the damn bitcoins in the first place.
@_date: 2015-10-15 07:41:50
C'mon sanswork think bigger, it won't hurt.
@_date: 2015-02-15 09:09:52
Please do an insane amount of research before you move any of those coins off cold storage.
And by an insane amount I mean do so much research that you never have the time to move those coins until atleast 2016.
@_date: 2015-02-06 08:22:53
Great comment. Thanks for taking the time to do that. A donut for you! @_date: 2015-02-13 07:56:13
Ha you make a good point, I've never seen a post besides this one about Vircurex either.
I've got 2 bitcoin frozen there, I took it as an expensive lesson in staying away from dodgy exchanges and moved on months ago, never did expect to get the funds back.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:48:56
Agreed.  Still lingering on my mind hours after watching.
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:51:57
 hasn't failed me yet
