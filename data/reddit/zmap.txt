You do understand that finite can be a long time? Or a long enough time? GPU mining is and will be profitable for some time. Get off your high horse.

Even if you look at inflation from 1990 it’s ridiculous.

I wonder what resources legacy currency uses.

More hash power has come online helping clear blocks faster. That’s the biggest reason.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:19:22
Environmentally harmful? Haha! Such a terrible point.
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:50:28
What’s wrong admiring someone you view is doing good work?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:44:56
Nothing wrong with that, it's unregulated. LOL
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:07:04
I don't think facts back up what you're saying. Any sources?
Also hoarding wouldn't always be more profitable, when mainstream adoption has taken place and most all of the speculation has left the currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:18:05
Well seeing as you have to spend to survive and enjoy things in life, I don't see a problem here. It is fine.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:33
Who doesn't want more options? Also GDAX has low to no fees if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:50
Not an argument.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:50:14
Tarnished BTC?? LOL you guys are way over-blowing this. Things will most likely be fine within a couple days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:45:33
You are exactly right. People should see this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:47:17
Yes. It's open source. Supply of original coins remain the same.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:22:57
Yes I understand that. They also have lower fees than Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:39
Ok, while I agree to an extent there is a difference. GDAX has no trading fees for makers (users who put an order on the books). That's a possibility for zero trading fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:55:28
You are correct in a sense. Nothing wrong with insider trading in an open market. 
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:29:17
Wow sounds like boot licking.
@_date: 2019-01-17 05:58:38
Thanks! I’ve been here too long haha
@_date: 2019-01-17 05:52:19
The love *of*.

Many people have spent their BTC and many more will do the same. People still have needs and wants that they can purchase with Bitcoin. It will work great as a currency.

Fake news, he became popular because he was against compelled speech both by laws/l and by campus policy.
I would think this sub would be pro free speech.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:02:03
Monarchism in a bitcoin sub. Delicious HAHAHA
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:09:08
That is pretty funny. Have a good one man.
