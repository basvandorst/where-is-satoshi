So say BC is selling at $17000 right now. But that only means there are some people willing to buy at $17000. These people are the only people willing to buy 1000 BC.  No one else want to buy at this price anymore. As soon as the 1000 get sold. The price drops significantly. 
Thats the simple explaination.

Ok, then tell me, whats this demand based on?  
You are basically saying people will buy bitcoin even if the value of bitcoin keep dropping in the future. If thats not what your saying then bitcoin is based on speculation.

I'm calling it. All it takes it one dude randomly posting something bad about bitcoin. Gets a bunch of upvotes. And bitcoin is gone.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:08:50
And the demand is based on what exactly? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:05:52
Bitcoin's value right now is based solely on speculation. If some dude made people think bitcoin will massively drop in value and the post gets upvoted. People will then start selling bitcoin and bitcoin go poop.

If they are the only thing preventing you from blowing your money, you'll probably lose your money somewhere else anyway.

Its not lol. Bitcoin value = electricity cost + speculation. A little bit more reliable than the stock exchange.
