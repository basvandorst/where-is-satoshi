I guess we're not as stupid as the media portrays us.  Hopefully the banks go out of business like Blockbuster.

Is there a noticeable taste difference over a $10 costco bottle of champagne from France though?

Bitcoin isn't the traditional Wall St. game.  In Wall St and Banking guys like Jamie Diamond and other Ivy Leaguers get FREE BILLIONS from the Federal Reserve at 0% interest.
Bitcoin is a different eco system for them.  They don't control it.

Wow!  Way to put it into perspective =)

$10,000 will be the new floor soon.
200 crypto hedge funds started this past year with 84 loading now.  These billionaires won't panic sell.  They're going to average in at $10,000 per coin and pump it to $100,000 + over the next couple of years.
Bitcoin is going to be the premium crypto currency.  Millionaires and Billionaires only... and the couple of thousands of regular guys here on Reddit.

That was a nice trade from $6150 to $7000, wish I sold at $7300 instead.
Waiting for the next trade.  I suspect this consolidates here then runs above $8000.

I like the comparison.  It's especially interesting how Tesla went from the $30s to several hundred and never looked back.  I expect Bitcoin to do similar.

I like Novogratz, great contribution OP.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:48:45
I don't think so in this particular case.

Yes the only play to retire early, have a Lambo, new house, vacation home, etc. is to go all in.  It's still cheap enough here too.

I'd rather have a Toyota 86, under $30k and fast enough.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:57:15
Weak hands got shaken out.  If you can't handle $2k down in 1 day then don't be in Bitcoin.

Big money is buying all the dips.  Very strong bull market here.

Once you tell her you just gave her 50% of your wealth.  Congratulations to her! 
I had a friend with a strong marriage, 2 kids and 14 years into it she meets some guy, goes crazy and takes him for 50%.
Be warned.  They turn on a dime.
I would legally get the Bitcoins out of your name and into a Trust you control that she can't touch ASAP.  Or at least half and hide the other half.
Your Bitcoin is only thing that won't stab you in the back.  Don't give her one satoshi, it's YOURS.

Upvoted, amazing.

If you aren't 100% in Bitcoin, sold all your shit, you don't want to take the risk to be a millionaire.  Enjoy being basic your entire life.

Golden Lambo, love it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:14:18
There's 153.97 750ml bottles here.  Maybe I'll pick one up.

If Cramer likes Bitcoin I like him!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:03:21
Physical Bitcoin coins are a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:13:06
LoL great thread.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:31:04
Let's see if we get a Parabolic move to the 20k range like the chart in the link below.  Good luck everybody.

Bitcoins "shitcoin" Bitcoin Cash is worth more than Ethereum.  A few of these will be winners I won't sell any.  Funny pic though.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:09:05
Chop pattern here higher high with MACD flipped pretty dangerous if you ask me to take a long right here.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:05:23
Bitcoin Cash is a Bitcoin fork and worth more than Ethereum...

When's the next hard fork?  I need more coins!  Keeping my Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and Shit2X!
As Bitcoin becomes more and more expensive one of these splits will be the "2nd winner" and I'll still have my coins!  I love Bitcoin.
