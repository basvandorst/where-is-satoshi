@_date: 2017-01-15 10:06:20
i think you should only put something like a wallet.dat on google drive or dropbox
@_date: 2017-01-21 01:36:01
maybe peak of 40.000 is possible 
the current bitcoin market cap in $ is really small and if bitcoin grows and more people get interested and use it then 40.000 will sound like nothing.
@_date: 2017-01-30 21:47:16
i see a big move to 5000$  coming
@_date: 2017-01-22 15:11:24
everytime blockchain gets mentioned is like advertising bitcoin itself because bitcoin was the first one to use it.
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:10:53

@_date: 2017-01-15 22:11:37
and you would kick yourself when you know you had 1 million coins back then and most of them are gone now or you sold them very cheap.
i mean 100 USD back then was unrealistically high
@_date: 2017-01-17 11:13:05
i think it took me like 5 days non stop
@_date: 2017-01-13 14:35:14

@_date: 2017-01-22 15:13:56
you are thinking in the wrong direction.
