Are paper wallets not worthy of this list? I was about to purchase one so I am curious or is it better to spring for a hardware wallet?

Basically they are contracts that don’t require a human. Digital assets are put into the contract and the contract will distribute the assets automatically once the terms are fulfilled.

Vitalik discusses some of the applications for smart contracts a bit in this talk also.

Payroll is a really obvious one I think. Now we have a person handling payroll for companies. Smart contracts could replace the need for this person. Distributing payments (bitcoin) to people completely automated. Other application would be insurance (auto, home, life). Smart contracts could potentially replace the human intermediary.

Coinbase is a company, not a public democratic entity lol. It’s a free market so go to one of their competitors. Petition is kind of silly lol.

Think it’s later today. Like 20 blocks away or something.

$120,000. Still a bubble though.

This is good. Bitcoin needs to get attack by people like this just so when Bitcoin emerges on the other side unscathed people will trust its security even more.

Do they smell? If not then maybe they are still okay.
No, that does suck though. I hope they resolve this.

Maybe you snapped a pic of the seed words. Check your cloud.

You sir are awesome. Great post!

Actually easier than I thought. Thanks!!

Why does it work one way but not the other? How does the code deal with this in the other currency and bitcoin cannot? Idk if my questions make sense but I’m confused how that is actually a thing that can take place.

You’re a saint.
@_date: 2018-08-23 04:20:58
Need bigger blocks apparently
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:40:16
Over the years of this happening and their being a finite amount wouldn’t we eventually get to the point of having most if not all Bitcoin trapped within dead peoples wallets?

This is just a subreddit. Maybe try bitcoin.org. Nobody here controls bitcoin. If this subreddit were to be deleted tonight the Bitcoin network wouldn’t care.
