I told the Coinbase people to use Postgres for this two years ago, and they treated me like a crazy person for it. Assuming you arrived at this through my advice and not the inevitable catastrophe, glad you finally took my advice to heart.
The next problem is that you are still using EventMachine. Still think I'm a crazy person? Oh look, it's like I'm a well-received field expert on this topic or something

Last time I scanned their web app's code, the server it was set to communicate with was not responding to API calls. That was in Amsterdam. It's pretty easy to pick apart their minfied javascript file and figure out what it's supposed to do, they're using Angular for the frontend.

Bi-directional bill acceptors are much more expensive, and require a larger ATM design. Cost per unit is not going to be $1000 like with the Skyhook. It's pretty weird to see pictures of the Skyhook from our web site on this crowdfund. I second Jon's thoughts.

I've helped work on Project Skyhook, which is a $1000 Bitcoin ATM: 
Orders ship within 2-3 weeks. Shipping to Canada is no problem, customs is no problem. Assembly is in Portland, Oregon, so it's a quick ship to Vancouver. We've shipped hundreds of units, dozens to Canada (possibly over a hundred by this point).
Setup is completely on the owner's end. Owners don't need the company to configure the unit, and the company doesn't need to run servers for them. Skyhook ATMs use blockchain.com for the wallets (using accounts the owner creates independently), and the exchange price source is the owner's choice, all controlled through the interface. This isn't to avoid having a setup phase - it's to allow owners to have complete control over their money, because then it's a trustless system (the source code to the ATMs is open and auditable: 
I'm astounded at the prices on some of these ATMs. For $25,000 they could have ordered 24 Skyhooks (a little padding for shipping, which I believe can be palleted to save money). Bitcoin ATMs shouldn't cost the down payment on a house, IMHO.
It's also not a ponzi scheme to pay off old debts or investor rounds like Mt. Gox or whatever. Skyhook was completely bootstrapped by the founders (no VCs) and a result of that (and careful burn rate management) is now profitable, despite the low price point. The cofounders have been using some of the money (and their free time) to help clean up and build out a new hacker/makerspace in Portland that's going to be awesome. Easily the best group of people I've ever had the privilege to work with. I'm not technically on payroll anymore (had to take some time off to work on some other projects and recover from a nasty bout of mono), but they're great people and I can't recommend Skyhook enough.

Brainwallet I believe is working to upgrade to the new version. We've gotten a few issues filed by them.
The new version of BitcoinJS -refuses- to use Math.random as an RNG. If you don't have a newer browser (all modern browsers and IE &gt;= 11), it will simply not work. We're using real crypto assist on the browsers: 
Ripping out legacy browser support was one of the first things we did when we started working on the refactor. Math.random + ARC4 is not safe to use as an RNG, I don't care how much mouse click entropy you throw into it.

This is a really great day for Open Source Bitcoin.
This marks the first release of Dark Wallet using a cleaned up, more stable version of BitcoinJS ( with a much better API, better testing, better performance and way less bugs (most importantly, with the bugfixes documented in strong-coverage tests). I recognize that upgrading wasn't simple, so I'm really happy they spent the time to do it.
There's a lot more collaboration going on in the Bitcoin OSS community now, at least on the JS library side. Which is the way it should be, because it lets us all advance more quickly without having to re-invent the kitchen sink or hack at an incomplete library every time. It means that more bugs get fixed in one place and are fixed for everybody, improving the stability of all wallets.
It also means that Stealth.JS and CoinJoin.JS are modular with the latest BitcoinJS library, which makes it easier for people making web wallets to implement privacy and anonymity for anyone based on this library (and there are a lot of wallets already doing that).
Dark Wallet is a very important project for the ecosystem, and they have demonstrated themselves to be high quality contributors to the Bitcoin OSS community. Please consider supporting them, they deserve it (and we need what they're working on).

I asked Bruce Schneier this question recently. He trusts Bernstein and Koblitz curves, because he trusts the people that made them. There is an alarming amount of implicit trust in ECC. Let's just say that, after the conversation, I invested some thought into the idea of using RSA for a cryptocurrency.
Of course, they're both goners if quantum computers get powerful enough. There are alternatives in the works though, so it's not going to be the end of cryptography.

I'm not into Bitcoin for the politics. If destroying the government was my chief concern, I would be working on anti-tank grenades.
I'm really into single payer health care. I don't think it should be OK for people to die because they can't afford health insurance, or flood our emergency rooms because people did not have access to preventative care. I think we should be better than that, and can be (even while paying less in taxes) if we reprioritize what government can be useful for, and move it out of the things it isn't good at (and I don't believe that number of things is 0).

Gavin, it was done, sipa did it. It has been used for almost a year by numerous people on an unstable branch, and nobody's had any problems. All somebody needed to do was push the "merge pull request" button.
It will, upon being merged, eliminate a lot of very ugly hacks people have had to resort to (one of those hacks being dependency on centralization APIs like blockchain.info), to get utxo information without having to feed a private key into bitcoind.
I've been submitting code to open source projects since the late 90s. My experience suggests that, frankly, the core team has some very messed up priorities for the direction Bitcoin core should be heading in, and largely doesn't understand what people are using it in the field for.

Coinpunk shares a lot of design decisions with Blockchain Wallet, so I would like to add some commentary here based on what I know. Feel free to call me out as wrong on any of this.
Coinpunk does not send wallet backups to e-mail addresses. I've pondered doing this, because it's nice to have a backup for users incase something goes wrong. But I decided that this is probably not a good idea, and I'll explain why.
I'm more than a little bothered by this line of code in MyWallet: 
That's a PBKDF2 iteration count for the password hasher of 10. That is very, very low for cryptography standards, and it makes it a lot easier for an attacker to brute force your password. Coinpunk, for contrast, is currently set to 1,000. It's not great, but it's better. I've pondered turning it up even more, at the cost of slowing down the app a bit. What I really want to do is crank that up to 10,000 or more, but that's when it starts to get very unbearably slow in JavaScript. It's not going to get much better until we get some good cryptographic support from the browser for doing password hashing.
Because of this, I'm a little worried that blockchain sends wallet files via email, even if they are encrypted. Email is not exactly infamous for its security. It's within the realm of feasibility that an attacker got your wallet file and simply brute forced it open. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to prevent from anybody other than the end user from getting that encrypted file.
It would be much better to sign and encrypt with a public key, such as a PGP key, before sending via email. Really, we should probably just be using PGP for anything important in email. I just pretty much assume that anything in email is exploitable at this point.
I'm also in agreement about the "too much money in a hot wallet" problem. What I should really do is provide an educational component to Coinpunk, to show people how to create cold wallets and explain the difference.
As always, I've got a lot of thinking/work to do. In the interim, I'm finishing up Coinpunk's 2FA implementation right now, which has been missing for far too long (incase I was making it look like Coinpunk had better security or something).
I'm sorry about your loss. Always sucks to read stuff like this.
Edit: I also wanted to say quickly that I like Blockchain, I use their wallet to store some of my Bitcoins, and I trust them to do a good job. This isn't meant to be a jab at their service.

Just one question:
Under these regulations, what would be the requirements for machines that dispense Bitcoins for US Dollars, and for individuals exchanging Bitcoins with eachother? Making users do AML/KYC for small transactions is extremely inconvenient and problematic, and I strongly believe that there should be reasonable protections on people's rights to exchange Bitcoins with eachother proposed in these regulations.
If these protections don't exist, I fear that Bitcoin will lose its organic growth due to legality, and simply become a slightly cheaper way for the banking industry to send money around.

I would love to do something like this, but unfortunately it's very difficult to do it legally. If I did, I would do it in a way that early contributors would not be left out. I would never do it any other way, for personal ethical reasons. I have some ideas for solving this for Bitcoin startups, but unfortunately those solutions would also legally prohibit me from doing it for Coinpunk itself. The JOBS act was overall positive, but it's still very restrictive unfortunately. And it would only be legal in the United States.
I may have just broke the law even saying that. They're super restrictive like that.
That all said, Coinpunk in its current form is not a startup - its an open source project. We don't have any equity because open source projects don't have any equity. The analogy would be "Gavin isn't giving out equity for the official Bitcoin project". I can't give out equity in a github repository. And I'm sure that Coinpunk is a useful thing right now - but I'm not sure if it's necessarily a profitable thing. Not everything should be a startup.
Calvin, I'm sorry I didn't get back to your email. I get a lot of email, and it's really tough for me to stay on top of things sometimes, especially during busy days. But yeah, I can't really give out equity right now because there simply isn't any.

The purpose of packaging software for a distribution is to make the released version of the software run without requiring manual compilation and dependency management (or as we used to call it, dependency hell). It should contain the latest stable version, with only patches needed to compile/run it for the distribution (only if neccessary), nothing more.
That's what I would expect from it, and I believe that is what most others would expect from it as well. Sometimes packages will compile with optional features for the library (even if you don't use them) for completeness, and occasionally I'll see a critical security patch or two for an abandoned project (bitcoin core does *not* qualify), but that's the extent of the modifications I have ever seen.
It would raise a warning flag to me if the release contained anything other than that, particularly given the security implications of this particular package. You really have to trust the maintainer of the package, and it's usually their PGP key that signs the package (if you're lucky - NPM and Rubygems still don't do this properly, so you need to trust the maintainer *and* the distribution mirrors).
If the source code paste is indeed the additional code, this is a hard-coded blacklist baked into what users are expecting to be an easier way to install a stable release of Bitcoin core. As a result, this package would not faithfully achieve the goal of providing the stable released version of Bitcoin core, as it has been modified for political reasons using the mechanisms designed to fix compile/run issues for that specific distribution.
If you want to express a different opinion as released software, make a fork. The Dark Wallet team does not agree with a lot of the direction Bitcoin core takes, but at no point did they ever hack Bitcoin core to fit their opinions and then release a distribution package and call it the canonical "bitcoin" package. They make their side heard, and then gave people a choice that is independent of that project. When you install obelisk, you know what opinions you are getting. Here, it is transparent to almost all the users who install it.
Make the "bitcoin" package the released version, and then make a "bitcoin-lukejr" version. If people agree with you, they will use it. Or argue to get your changes merged into core. This is not the way to do this.

There will most likely be bugs. My original concern with Coin Join (which I brought up in Milan) is that it is going to be difficult to engineer correctly. And of course, bugs between multiple implementations amplify the problem.
I might be able to find time to build something for this once things stabilize. But honestly, I think the best approach Dark Wallet could have is to make the Coin Join code into a standalone library, so that developers can use it in their own wallets without having to rip it haphazardly out of Dark Wallet. Wouldn't hurt to do the same with stealth addresses.

Asking for money to do an article is a huge red flag. This is not standard practice at all.
A similar flavor of this is when people have conferences and only give talks to people that sponsor them.

Hi, I've been doing some work with the Project Skyhook team. You don't have to order 10, you can order -up to- 10. We are currently limited by BitPay to a $10k maximum per order at the moment, but we're working to get that raised soon.
The units can and will be shipped internationally, it isn't US-only. US customers will need to sign a due diligence form (listed on the order page) and send it to us until we can ship due to US legal reasons, but that restriction does not apply to non-US purchases.

I know the feeling. Skyhook is trying very hard to buck the trend. Very, very hard.
One thing that's helped is that there was never a preorder. We only shipped when we had something to ship and we knew we could scale production. If someone dropped a 400 order bomb on us, we could fulfill it eventually, but it would definitely be slower than 1-3 weeks. But for the current order demand, things are very much under control.
There were some early bugs in the software we didn't catch that some are mentioning (If you've ever had to flash the firmware on your router or computer to fix a bug, you know the story), but we've managed to improve things a lot since launch, and the newest Skyhook ships with the latest version of the software, so you get those fixes out-of-the-box. There's likely still some lingering bugs (as there is in any software of this complexity), but if they're found, and they're fixable, they will get fixed.

None. I decided to not use Mt Gox after I learned that they were using MD5 for password hashing.

Hello, Kyle here with Coinpunk. Please send an e-mail to contact and I'll look into this. Apologies for the issue. I made some recent changes that could be the reason for this.
It is highly unlikely that your coins have been lost. We conduct logging that allows us to recover coins in the event of a wallet save failure (don't worry, it's still encrypted and we still can't access it without your credentials).
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:28:40
I'm happy to address all of these. An unspent outputs index improves:
Security - It means people can separate private keys from the network information retrieval that people should be using bitcoin core for. I shiver at the thought of how many millions of dollars have been lost due to lack of good wallet assist APIs in bitcoind.
Privacy - It allows developers to build wallet solutions that don't depend on external services like blockchain.info, and prevents snoops from seeing what addresses the node is specifically looking at (because everything is indexed).
Scalability - You can build a giant pile of throwaway bitcoind servers using something like Chef/Puppet/Docker, and not have to worry about managing the wallet state outside of the wallet itself. Required trust of bitcoind is reduced significantly.
Openness - Open source and locally run, vs centrally run and proprietary.
Simplicity - All of the business logic is there to do the indexing and deal with edge cases, so it's just a matter of adding one more index, the same way transactions are optionally indexed.
Ease of Use - You just set something like "utxoindex=1" in bitcoin.conf and start the daemon. No additional software or process management is needed. You don't have to wait for bitcoind to catch up with the block chain before running a second process to index the utxos independently.
Cost - It only adds ~10-20GB of disk space, and it's completely optional. It's as resource demanding as a B-Tree, more or less.
I would love to write this and send a pull request, unfortunately C++ is a much lower language than I'm accustomed to working with, I have no familiarity with the bitcoind code base (which is not famous for its approachability), and honestly wouldn't be able to provide very helpful code.
That said, given the reaction we've received to an already working flavor of this via importaddress, what's the point of even trying? I can't think of a logical difference between this and the 2-3 other attempts to get this into bitcoin core. The real problem here is that you don't believe this is an important thing, and not a single pull request from me is ever going to change that. So I've given up, and I'm working on shoddy solutions that don't depend on bitcoind, unfortunately. Which also happens to be what every other wallet implementation is using right now.

RE your asking me to hire someone to implement code in bitcoin core for me.. do you realize that, as a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, your board funded me for 3 months of living expenses as part of the Coinpunk grant to work on web wallet improvements? I don't have the budget of a startup to hire good C contractors. I mentioned very specifically in the grant that Coinpunk would be depending on this functionality. This is copied and pasted from the Coinpunk grant proposal I sent to the Bitcoin Foundation:
*I have already begun on the client-side transaction signing, which will provide a way to encrypt private keys on the browser-side, adding an additional layer of protection (the server will not have access to the private keys), and will take advantage of the upcoming importaddress functionality of bitcoind ( and ultimately multi-wallet support as well.*

Possibly? I would need to query by address, so the index would need to be indexed that way.

It's not a full time 5 person team. These are people working part time that want to spend more time contributing.
I've talked with a few Bitcoin startups about joining in this capacity, but haven't found a match that would allow me to utilize my skills within the context of the startup, and allow me to work on Coinpunk part-time without having to compromise our long term vision. If you know any, please do tell.
I'm a weird fit for most startups. I do write code, but I tend to work best at a higher level position than just a programmer so I can help do some steering and strategy. Once startups get to &gt;5 people, they tend to not be interested in me working with them in that capacity.. I inevitably find out that they're just looking for devs. It's frustrating, to say the least.

Not precisely core development, but the Coinpunk project could really use help to be able to continue building open source Bitcoin software.
Echoing Jeff Garzik's comments, the level of contributions to open source software in the Bitcoin ecosystem right now (esp. core development) is low, and incredibly disproportionate to the level available for startups. We're at a stage where startups will fail unless we can secure funding to improve the infrastructure. What we're seeing with Mt. Gox reflects that problem perfectly. If we can get better tools into their hands, we reduce the risk of customware bugs crashing Bitcoin. It's a serious problem.
Coinpunk hasn't gotten close to our budget needs, and I'm getting concerned that we may have to scale back on our open source work if we can't figure something out, or a major donor comes in to help us.

Peter Todd has been instrumental in developing key ideas for improving Bitcoin anonymity and privacy and lobbying passionately for their implementation, work which should be an extremely high priority, but has been shoved into the backburner by pretty much everybody else except Dark Wallet.
He's a rigid debater at times, and it can be a little off-putting (and ego bruising), but I try to value honesty and frankness over politeness because it's a better system, so his style's grown on me. He gave me a lot of shit when I told him I didn't use PGP, and as a result of those conversations I now use PGP thoroughly, and I'm glad I do. Peter, by the way, has also been doing crucial work improving PGP adoption and verification, including being part of Max &amp; Chris's new Keybase alpha.
The link you provide regarding getutxos does not indicate that Peter Todd is opposed to them, he just wants them implemented in a way he believes is better, and among other things mentions that it should provide support for prefix searches (Searching for the first N characters of a Bitcoin address to get a random pile of results, which makes it harder for people to trace which addresses the wallet is actually interested in). I think you should read his comments more closely before you decide that his comments in here are a conspiracy to destroy bitcoin. FWIW, I'm not sure I'm happy with the idea of putting getutxo support in the core protocol either, there's a lot of potential problems with doing that, a fact the thread provides a flavor of.
As for the "selling half of his BTC", don't punish people for being honest about their risk aversion. Peter wanted to highlight the problem so that more people would become interested in solving it. Guess what, I sold half my BTC too before the bubble burst in December, because I needed to make sure I had a salary for a year to be able to work, and the USD does happen to be quite a bit more stable than BTC is right now. Does that make me anti-bitcoin too? So be it.
I'll even go this far: Peter Todd has done more to ensure the success and survival of Bitcoin than most of the core team. If you're looking for the people that are blocking getutxo support in Bitcoin Core, and turning a blind eye on dealing with the privacy problem, look no further than the core team themselves, which have been crapping (sans a few great people) on every single attempt I've made to get getutxo implemented.
Does this mean Bitcoin Core is trying to destroy Bitcoin? No. It just means we have a difference of opinion. One that I'm more than a little unhappy about, but it's not a conspiracy.
 - Here is Bitcoin Core ignoring my request to put in getutxo. Which puppet masters do you think are pulling their strings? Are you going to post an anonymous reddit post about them?
 - Here they are with a working implementation of getutxo, rejecting it because it conflicts with coin control, a feature I doubt anyone really cares about. (Oh look, Peter Todd is in this thread providing useful information!)
Your post amounts to nothing more to an unfounded conspiracy theory, possibly because you have a personal vendetta against Peter, possibly because you're actually this crazy. I do have to say though, it's pretty cowardly to make anonymous Reddit accounts to engage in personal attacks on people, and tells me a lot more about the character of you than it does Peter.
I'll leave with a parting link: Peter's fascinating proof of concept of a bloom data hiding attack:

The Bitstamp activity one I wouldn't really call a bug. It's considered a best practice to randomize the order of the outputs, though, perhaps to make it harder to figure out which address is the change address if you're generating new ones for change.
Managing generated private keys was a pain in the ass, which is why a lot of wallets (blockchain) don't generate new addresses but send back the origin. The better way to do this now is to use HD wallets, because there's no chance of loss, you only need to store the HD seed the first time correctly. From an engineering standpoint it's a lot easier to persist one thing than have to persist a new thing every time a transaction occurs. Trust me on that one.

Developer of coinpunk here, I can vet that this is pretty much the only way to do it without resorting to the patch.
I wish that bitcoind could support having an index of the current utxos, it would save us a lot of trouble having to trawl the blockchain like this with a separate process, which adds an enormous amount of complexity that is probably best left to bitcoind since it already has to parse the blockchain anyways.

Making source code open instantly creates prior art for ideas. It's not a problem, it's a feature of open source.
I've worked at many startups, and patents have always been our biggest problem. Getting hit with a patent lawsuit is easily expensive enough to break the back of a startup, even a fairly well funded one. I know people at one that pushed for an acquisition simply because they were concerned about the patent risk from a competitor. No joke.
Destroying the ability to patent ideas is not intrinsically an act of charity when I do it, it's a business strategy. It protects my work against these lawsuits, which is a better prize than trying to make money off of them.
I may someday decide something I come up with is worthy of a patent, but really, I just hate patents and would rather make money by winning over customers and gaining their trust. They can (rarely) be used to protect an innovator against larger competition. Bigger competitors can steal your ideas and spend all the money in the world on them, but it won't build them trust. It's a better strategy in the long run, IMHO. Jingoistically, it's also a lot more American.

Frankly, I'm starting to come around to your opinion. I'm pondering using the GPL in my future projects, it seems clear to me that the community is incapable of policing itself without increased requirements for usage of "open source" software.
That said, GPL would force disclosure of source, but it wouldn't force them to be good players. It's one thing to dump a tarball of code somewhere, it's another to send BitcoinJS good pull requests that improve the library for everyone, and adopt your code to use the latest and greatest. That requires a responsible, proactive development team, and nothing really legally forces that (nor should it, probably).
In this case though, BitcoinJS (formerly bitcoinjs-lib) started as BSD, so I would not have changed the license in this scenario to respect the intentions of it's founding author.
FWIW, I don't do much Bitcoin coding anymore. It's more a combination of other projects I need to focus 100% on, and that there are better maintainers (read: better at coding with Bitcoin) for things like BitcoinJS than I am. But lack of funding for open source infrastructure was obviously a large motivator. I simply don't have enough money saved up to work on Bitcoin full-time without compensation, and I haven't meshed well with the current crop of Bitcoin startups. It's a classic Tragedy of the Commons problem, or something.
Anyways, I don't have time to contest the patent, but someone else is welcome to use the old BitcoinJS source as a reference, and I'm prepared to testify to that in writing if someone needs it.

Note that no BitGo employees contributed anything to that file.
IIRC, BitGo used the same BitcoinJS base (except an older, buggy version) to build their own version. This is the version that fucked up a transaction fee a few days ago, if I understand it. Maybe they should spend their time porting over to the better version of the library I helped build instead of filing a bunch of software patents so they can troll it up with the Intellectual Ventures dicks.

Thanks, appreciate the support.
Incase I didn't make this obvious enough from my nature, if someone is doing this intentionally to Coinbase posts on Reddit, that's wrong and should be looked into.
But again, it just happens everywhere. If I posted this same post on Hacker News that Brian did, it would have been downmodded and written off. Being critical of their investment model is against their interests, therefore it must die.
The surprising thing to me isn't that widespread attention manipulation is going on. This kind of robber baron crap goes all the way back to the 19th century. It's the reason Americans don't think Global Climate Change exists, despite the fact that their weather this year is going completely insane. The only surprising thing to me is that everyone seems to believe that the modern tech industry is immune to such abuses.
Let's just say there's a reason that the startup that always wins Techcrunch Disrupt is Michael Arrington's investment, and leave it at that. Actually Techcrunch has never done an article on Neocities either, despite me dutifully submitting every time. I'm not connected to any of their financial interests (they're basically an investment company at this point) so they don't care.
Journalists are also subject to the same abuses. I know high-level journalists that have been blackballed from events at large startups (as in, ones on the "Unicorn" list and larger) because they wrote articles criticizing something the company was doing. It makes the journalists afraid to report anything negative on the company, because it threatens their ability to do their work.
The real way to solve problems like this is to use open source portals that have provably fair systems, and make sure to account for moderation actions.  is a great example of a better way to do this. It would be fairer for Coinbase (which certainly deserves attention for this sort of thing), and for me too.

I don't think you understand. When I post things that people like, they sink faster more quickly that others, despite having more votes in a shorter period of time. It involves something special HN is using to make them sink faster, in a way that is designed to make it look arbitrary enough that nobody speaks up about it. I have screenshots demonstrating it and everything.
I have no idea of the mechanism of how it works, whether it be via an anchor on my user, or on words related to my work, or individuals at coinbase that have mod access on HN.
But it happened to start right around when that article came out. Before that, the rankings made sense. It certainly doesn't seem like a coincidence.
I think it's worth mentioning that I am by far not the first one that has accused HN of ranking manipulation and anchoring posts.

My articles posted to Hacker News on the work I've been doing (including ones having nothing to do with Bitcoin) have been getting provably anchored for a while (perhaps still) since I was in an article critical of Coinbase at Wired last year ( Almost all of my posts there sink faster than other posts with less upvotes posted longer ago, which didn't happen before that article was published.
They also clearly make any startups related to YC have a benefit in the rankings, and provide sticky hiring posts that don't allow commenting. As someone on the receiving end of unfair ranking manipulation, I sympathize with you.
I don't know what to say, welcome to the club. Your guys are doing it too, except to me. That's what happens when money and journalism become entangled, you get William Randolph Hearst style ethics. It's one of the many reasons I'm getting really sick of the tech bubble.

Hello, the guy working on Coinpunk here.
I saw the article on Dark Wallet a while ago. They're working on a project that probably needs a JS-based wallet, and I'm working on a JS-based wallet. They're also working on a new Bitcoin node system, which Coinpunk needs (bitcoind is too heavy). It makes sense that we're going to collaborate on things, so I sent them an e-mail and said I could join their project for a period of time and help out if needed. That's my involvement in the project at this point. I believe the funds are going towards putting people together in a collaborative space and paying expenses for that. I'm not expecting to receive any of it, except perhaps to get compensated for travel/lodging if I joined them for a few weeks to work on the project with them.
I don't share this video's opinions on the Bitcoin Foundation. I think they are a great organization and I like their work. I agree (so far) with the foundation's opinion that they will make good progress by opening a dialogue with governments, especially since emphasis on the business side has been mainly on liberalization of existing regulatory frameworks. The -existing- regulations on money transmission are just as bad for Bitcoin development as any new ones that may be proposed, and I think a reasonable way to ask them to reduce the regulatory burden on Bitcoin startups is to, well, ask them. It may not work, but I see no harm in trying it.
That's my opinion on the short term, though I'll admit that the recent NSA revelations have not exactly strengthened it, nor have the weird cease-and-desists sent to Bitcoin entities (which the Bitcoin Foundation has also had to deal with). Long term, we'll see. As I understand it, the project's goal is to make something that could survive that long term if things go sour, and that sounds like a great idea to me. Internationally, there are existing governments where projects like this will probably already be needed. Projects like Tor are built in a similar light, and Tor's founder (Jacob Applebaum) has been subject to US government harassment as a consequence of it ( I am prepared to accept this risk to help build the Bitcoin ecosystem for everyone, be it innovative new startups or crypto-anarchists. It's just something you have to get comfortable with when you work in the disruptive technologies world.
Dark Wallet's differing opinions on the foundation don't mean I'm not going to help them to build their project. The point here is to have a rich ecosystem of Bitcoin software. So I will help them if they need it, I will use their code if I need it, and that's my commitment to collaborate with them.
I think it's a great project and a great team, and I highly encourage people to help contribute!
Hope that clears things up a bit.

This vulnerability shows perfectly the danger of using "bank account" Bitcoin services vs services like Electrum, Blockchain.info and Coinpunk that provide a real wallet you have meaningful control over.
You could have 3 factor auth to access your money, or 20 passwords composed of cryptographically random UUIDs, or send a garrison of Star Destroyers to patrol your account, it doesn't matter. In the end, all an attacker has to do is bypass server security, and she goes right through all of that and spends all the money on the site.
Googling for "Bitcoin wallet hacks" will find you dozens of examples of how people tried to secure server wallets and completely failed.
History suggests I shouldn't trust Coinbase anymore, and you probably shouldn't either.

Well if it's a cold storage wallet, I'm guessing it's either a bad RNG, brain wallet, or an inside job. Brain wallets are pretty dangerous, especially the ones that just use a SHA for the hash (scrypt is.. not great, but better). At any rate, DO NOT USE A BRAIN WALLET FOR AN EXCHANGE BACKUP, EVER.
Bad RNG is the reason I got interested in refactoring BitcoinJS. There were a lot of cold storage wallet generators using the crap JS RNG method (Math.random).
Any cold storage wallets using the new BitcoinJS won't have this problem. FWIW, I don't use a browser for this, I generate them using a node command line and then encrypt them with the bip38 module, with all code directly from the Github repository with verified commit signatures. It's the only way I can confirm the code comes from people I trust.
This is also the reason we don't ship pre-minified BitcoinJS files. I have to run npm install, dump a ton of unsigned dependencies in and then trust that none of them have been tampered with. I can't verify it's safety, so I don't sign it. It's not going to get better until NPM figures out a way to require code to be signed by developers, and even then the trust problem remains.
Welcome to the jungle, I guess. 
Edit: I also wanted to mention that disconnecting your machine from the internet does not intrinsically improve the RNG (though it prevents hackers from potentially breaking into the machine, which is a different problem). The way to make a RNG better is basically to feed more crap into it, and ethernet noise/data is one of the many things that will get tossed into it if it's available. It's about the diversity of the sources of entropy. This article is illuminating:

I'm amazed at how many people are falling for these scams. Maybe I should announce a 5000GH/s miner and see how many people just give me a dump truck full of money without any background checking or proof I can make anything.
I've never mined, and I really don't get mining anymore. There was a point where this made sense to me, but now it just seems like this crazy race to the bottom, where you invest at such an early point that you're not even guaranteed to get anything, and by the time you get it the network has adjusted the difficulty to compensate.
Let me ask a fundamental economics question. Why would a mining company sell this equipment when they could just plug it in themselves and use it to make the money they claim it will make? Until I can get a good explanation of why that is not the case, I'm going to just assume that all these mining offers are intrinsically shady.

Hi, developer working on Coinpunk here.
I'm doing a talk next month at JingJS (in Beijing, China) on Coinpunk, Bitcoin and how we can bridge the gap between Eastern and Western Bitcoin startups. A lot of Bitcoin developers have told me they will be there.
It's not a Bitcoin-specific conference, but I think it's a good start. Feel free to join, especially if you're a javascript developer! 
Outside of the conference, I'm planning on meeting with a lot of Bitcoin investors and exchanges in China.

Because they are useful, and scarce. That gives them value. The exchange price of that value can change, but the value still exists.

I am the person working on Coinpunk, which is one of the groups receiving funding from this.
I can confirm that I have received a small grant from the BDF to pay living expenses for a few months so that I could work on Coinpunk full time (this was prior to the Bitcoin Foundation grant, which extended the amount of time I can work on this project). I'm planning a Coinpunk V2 alpha release within a two or three weeks, which is longer than I had hoped but things came up (insert delays jokes here). For an example of the stuff I've had to deal with, I got delayed a bit to rewrite the RNG I'm using to deal with some of the problems brought up by the Android vulnerability, which I just released for review: 
I'm not trying to weigh into the "mining delays" controversy. But I did in fact receive this, and as a result of it (and other help) I have been able to work on a new open-source web wallet for Bitcoin full time that everybody can use.
I think it's important to note that I'm not rolling around in cash either, which everybody seems to think for some reason. I'm eating at home, spending most of my time working on Coinpunk, biking everywhere I go, sneaking flasks into bars, and there's a tipjar in front of me for anyone that wants to help. I could walk away from this and make a shit ton of guaranteed money back in the "d-bag VC" startup world. But it's worth it, because Bitcoin needs a better wallet story, the new Coinpunk is going to be awesome, Bitcoin is the best idea ever, and I don't need a fancy new car (I like my old Ford Focus.. it's reliable).

Having watch him fail to predict several recessions and at least two instances of stagflation in my study of economics, and fail to predict both the ongoing cause and course of the Japanese recession, I respectfully disagree.

"To fight this recession the Fed needs more than a snapback; it needs soaring household spending to offset moribund business investment. And to do that, as Paul McCulley of Pimco put it, Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble." - Paul Krugman

Upvoted because I mostly agree with you.
RE Blockchain, that's a pretty bad response to a security investigation in the link you provided. I would not approach a security issue that way, but as my code has to be fully open source, it's a lot easier for me to say that.
I agree with you that JS injection is also a risk, but IMHO it's a more manageable one than private keys on servers (there are many ways to monitor and mitigate injection attacks). You can also with a little effort make signed plugins and desktop apps using the same code base, if you want a better trust system. That's my ultimate goal with Coinpunk: To provide a combination of everything, that's fully open source.

I saw that BTC China might be making a profit off of the bid-ask spread in this thread 
I'm really interested in how the exchange uses this mechanism to make a profit, and was wondering if anyone could explain it for me. I'm not a seasoned market investor (I focus on the wallet side of Bitcoin right now), so this is a new and very odd concept to me.
I also found an interesting wikipedia reference to this: 
@_date: 2013-08-03 06:56:36
Coinbase is doing it correctly. Most of the Bitcoin exchange rates are being set with a 3 or 4 exchange weighted average, which does not include Mt Gox anymore. It's not a lack of arbitrage problem: there are problems moving USD out of Mt Gox right now, and the price difference reflects that. I'm not sure when/if this problem will go away, nobody I've talked with has plans to add Mt. Gox back.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:57:15
The reaction to all of this is completely ridiculous, because it lacks good context. I posted a great article yesterday about the shadow banking system in China and how it relates to Bitcoin, and it got downvoted because people thought it was an "attempt to drop the price of Bitcoin". Anyone that knows me and my work can attest, I don't have any interest in Bitcoin falling, at all. It was an attempt to have an honest conversation about what is going on in China's economy right now, from someone that is currently putting together a documentary on the topic.
Bitcoin is still up around 444% if you look at the chart from six months ago:  It's still one of the best investments of the year, if you compare it to pretty much everything else (the stock market, gold price, options, housing, oil, you-name-it). When the fed tapering program begins, I think we are going to see a similar (though probably not as drastic) drop in the stock market as well, which I also believe to be overinflated. That hits a lot of people too, most of whom have their retirement funds built on it. It's just the nature of investing, which I have a lot of trouble at times isolating from the idea of gambling.
The real lesson here is that if you're just trying to get into Bitcoin to make easy money, you're going to be disappointed. People should be hesitant of get rich quick schemes in general, and in altcoins in particular. When friends and family ask if they should buy Bitcoin, I immediately warn them that getting into Bitcoin solely on price increase speculation is akin to gambling or stock investing and should be treated as such. As Roger Ver said, Bitcoin's price is the least interesting thing about it. What excites me about Bitcoin is the ability to control your own purchasing power, and not require a central system (bank, payment processor) to manage and send it. Bitcoin is still at an incredibly early stage in its development, and like anything, there is a lot of uncertainty now, and to come.
It's not my intention to gloat, but I want to give you a positive story against all this doom and gloom. I sold enough of my ownership of Bitcoin at about $950/BTC to pay my usual salary in USD for an entire year, which will allow me to work on Coinpunk and Neocities (and the documentary work) full-time, and hopefully have some extra funds to pay people that help me work on it. I have never had this opportunity in my life, and I'm really excited about it. It's like getting angel investment without the investor, and it gave me complete autonomy to do for the project what I feel is right. For me (and for people that were sensible about it), it's been a very good year. I realize that not everyone has such a positive story, and I'm certainly not happy about that. But for me, it has allowed me to focus on building the single thing that will improve Bitcoin's value long term: infrastructure.
My prediction is that the China situation is going to get sorted out eventually. But sure, until that happens, the value of Bitcoin has fallen because of concerns about liquidity. If the US banned the ability to exchange dollars, I imagine you would see a similar drop in its value as well. And it's looking like most countries are invariably going to not ban Bitcoin. The US hearings in particular were quite positive. If China's government decides it's done with Bitcoin, it just means that other countries will have the opportunity to become the leader in Bitcoin startups. And that's also a positive thing for me ultimately, but sadly, not as much for the future entrepreneurs in China I met while I was there. As someone that works on startups for a living, I would always rather have a level playing field than be given an opportunity due to a punitive effect.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:58:04
Is he suggesting Greenspan create a housing bubble here, or predicting it? My understanding is that he is suggesting it. Krugman is a strong believer in heavy liquidity during recessions to fix them, which is what leads to bubbles being created in the first place. That's my principal critique of his policy recommendations. He had a similar suggestion for Japan, which led to their enormous debt-to-gdp ratio, that (alongside an aging population) is threatening to pull apart their economy.
And then, of course, when it's obvious it's a problem, he comes right around and attacks it. Paul Krugman is inconsistent, but he sounds impressive when doing so. Hence, my critique of his opinion on Bitcoin. You need to dig through the archives to see that inconsistency.
Bitcoin is falling in price right now because China is blocking the ability to send money to exchanges, not because Bitcoin suddenly has zero intrinsic value. Bitcoin would have zero intrinsic value if a problem was discovered in its design that is not resolvable.

Bitcoind really needs about 3-4GB to run well. You can create a ton of swap to displace it on VPSs, but it's going to be much slower. Swap isn't designed for normal functioning, it's really more of an emergency measure to prevent the machine from locking up.
I've been doing work with btcd lately, and am currently testing it as a replacement for Coinpunk. I've never seen its memory consumption go over 300MB, without having to add extra swap space.

I wanted to add a note regarding the title. Best of NHK has a weekly Asia-focused economics program that has been discussing this problem for months. They don't call it a shadow currency system, they call it a shadow **banking** system, which I think is a more appropriate description of what's going on here. You can watch "Asia Biz Forecast" on an unrelated site I built a while ago so I could watch NHK on demand: 
It's more than a little ironic to me that the People's Bank of China is so worried about Bitcoin speculation, whilst creating one of the biggest credit bubbles in human history. When we took the bullet train from Beijing to Shanghai to interview Bobby Lee, you could visually see the bubble and it was terrifying - large clusters of towering condos in the middle of nowhere, each one with a construction crane attached to it, with no train stops, surrounded by farmland and farmers that could never afford to live in them.
Once the investors realize that they won't get full capacity at the expected prices (and realize that shoddy construction and no maintenance tends to make buildings that fall apart), they'll be forced to take a write off, and when that happens, a lot of on-paper money is going to vanish into thin, smoggy air.
Considering the alternatives, Bitcoin is one of the sanest investments in China right now, which I believe is why the demand has been so high (in addition to the speculation and whatnot).

The one possible nice thing about it being considered an investment though, is that you might be able to register more than one year returns as long-term capital gains for tax purposes. I'm not sure if this was not previously true, but it's a lower tax rate, and that's potentially good for bitcoin people.
I would love to get a real tax expert's analysis on this. There's a lot of people that made a lot of money on Bitcoin, and probably have no idea how to file taxes on this stuff. Allow me to include myself in that statistic (sans the "lot" part).

Did you seriously make an anonymous Reddit account just to post this?
I offer no guarantees as to my credibility, but I wear my work and my opinions on my sleeve, for a reason. If I screw up or do or say something stupid (oh yes, I do), I'll have to answer for it as a person. I like it that way. I don't hide behind corporate firewalls and anonymous accounts. That's what builds credibility.
This is a blog post I did for a local (Portland, Oregon) tech blog about Bitcoin recently. Casually note the complete lack of mention of the price of Bitcoin, or that it's some kind of get rich quick scheme, or that it's goal is to nuke the US government, or that it will blow away the stock market and you should immediately dump your life savings into it: 
I'm not a professional (nor amateur, frankly) investor, and that's not my goal with Bitcoin at all, nor my interest. I prefer to earn my keep by building things, and I like goals. But I don't like personal financial risk, so I simply made a conservative move to ensure that if Bitcoin were to have issues, it wouldn't mean I would have to stop working on Bitcoin projects full time. The remaining coins lost their value alongside everyone else's. It was a lot. I don't care. I still believe in Bitcoin. I'm in this for the long haul.
It could have gone exactly the other way. The PBOC could have announced they were making Bitcoin accounts, it could have hit $2000/BTC and I would have been considered an idiot by everybody for selling it. Happy is not exactly the word I would use to describe the outcome, or my choices.

I've described it very similarly in my early talks with Bitcoin: 
Deflation is a total shock to our economy, because everything is designed for inflation. So for our current economic infrastructure, deflation is very very bad, because there's a nasty correction. But what happens after a modern deflationary correction adjusts? The common answer you get right now is "the rich will get super rich forever and never invest in anything because inflation won't force them to". Perhaps, but I wanted to read some actual research on this topic.
I did some digging on the nature of deflation to try to find some answers, but I found surprisingly little research on the topic. Most of it was "economic doomsday" stuff. One interesting book I did stumble onto was "Deflation: Current and Historical Perspectives" which was a fairly heavy compilation of essays and research papers from a lot of money theorists. They had a quote in the introduction that made economics a lot more interesting to me: "It is unclear just how much monetary policy makers should fear deflation today."
More reading suggestions on this topic would be great.

IMHO Paul Krugman is one of the bigger quacks in economics, and I say this having done quite a bit of reading on the topic. I usually enjoy his perspective because it's different and that lets me compile a bigger picture of what the debate is, but he's treated like a god in the "pop-culture" economic circles, which includes things like frequent references to the Tulip Bulb bubble because Michael Pollan wrote about it in the Botany of Desire (a good book, but not exactly an exhaustive economic study).
Whenever I challenge his opinions, I get attacked for "daring to think I know more than a Nobel Prize winner from the London school of economics" like I did here: 
If you're getting your economic expertise from a Paul Krugman blog and Botany of Desire, you're doing it wrong. Get some real books on economics, from multiple perspectives/schools of economics, and make your own decisions on what the evidence suggests. Then when economic events happen, you can compare the schools of economics and their track record, and arrive at your own conclusions.
As for the actual article, it's pretty tough for me to take a blog post titled "Bitcoin is Evil" very seriously.

It depends. You can wire money if you have a bank account, but there's over 130 million migrant workers in China, and they can't.
It's illegal in China to move to another city without permission from the government, so if I wanted to move from the countryside into Beijing, I would need to get a permit. Because it's usually impossible to get one, workers just illegally move there and live underground - working the jobs needed in Beijing, very similar to how migrant workers in the United States operate. They move there because they can't find work in rural China. Often they will leave their family behind, and need to send that money back home for them.
You can't get a bank account in China in Beijing if you don't legally live there. So what these migrant workers do is store the money they earn in cash, and then take it back once a year for their family, usually during Chinese New Year (which is coming up next month). There is a great documentary about this: 
It was mentioned to me by someone during interviews for the documentary that people might be using Bitcoin this way, to send money back home, but it's currently just speculation at this point.

"There's less investment and less growth."
Loans are just one type of investment, there are many others that don't share this problem. For some types of investment, donations, and grants, deflation can be positive. A lot of Bitcoin investments this year at $100/BTC ended up going farther at $700/BTC. With a simple adjustment, you can invest (or ask for) less to achieve the same (or a better) result. You could adjust the investment to account for deflation, the same way we adjust for inflation.

I'm not super surprised by this. Detroit's economy has been contracting for a while.
New York City was bankrupt in the 70s, but they came back from it.
Not saying the US economy isn't doing stupid things, but let's keep Detroit in perspective. It's not "the beginning of the end" for America. It's kindof an isolated incident that isn't (highly) related.
Minneapolis, for example, realized that manufacturing was contracting and switched to a service economy from manufacturing in the 60s, and as a result is financially doing pretty well and has low unemployment. The state of Minnesota is constitutionally obligated to not have an unbalanced budget. So yeah. Let's keep things in perspective here.

I don't understand the basis of your concerns, but I think this may be due to misinformation. I'm not asking for people to trust me to store their Bitcoin wallets. I'm developing a tool to allow them to store their own. I'm trying to create a system where they don't have to trust me.
There are presently not a lot of choices around for web wallets. Which makes them susceptible to attack by hackers or governments. The recent Tor "Freedom Host" incident I think perfectly highlights the problem. The lack of open source web wallets could potentially create a dangerous choke point in Bitcoin, where the vast majority of wallets/accounts are held by two or three companies. The US Government, for example, could trivially seize the domains of the top 3-4 Bitcoin web wallet services in existence today and essentially crush it. That might not "kill" Bitcoin, but if the majority of wallets are seized for some "money laundering" reason, or something similar, they might as well have just killed it.
Further, it's not just a web wallet potentially. Because it is a web application, it is very possible to convert it to a desktop-based wallet with minimal effort. HTML5/JS is the universal programming language, it runs on everything. So by making a web service, I also make most of the parts needed to make another desktop client as well.
I'm sorry to hear that you are mad about this, it is certainly not my intention to make people angry. But I do believe strongly this is a high priority for improving the Bitcoin ecosystem. And I hope my work over the next three months convinces you (and any others with concerns) that this is a good project in the long term, and a wise use of the foundation's grant program.

I'm really surprised this is a problem some wallet services have. There is no bitcoin specific technical reason for it, as far as I can tell.
Coinpunk ( (both the original and the new one I'm working on) transactions sent to BitPay are received in seconds, and I've never seen BitPay slow down in any of my tests. There's no confirmations until a block with the transaction comes in of course, but initial payment acknowledgement is very fast (under 10 seconds in all of my tests).
Actually, transaction sending is so quick with my current implementation I didn't even bother to put in an asynchronous work queue for it, I currently just send the orders in-line to the client nodes (I'm adding a work queue, but it's more related to reliability issues in the event a node client stalls/fails, and will only add a negligible amount of extra time to the transaction send). Perhaps there is some cronjob or time based processing with some of these wallet services, which would be bad because you should really use a push/pull architecture for this kind of work (which is exactly what I'm doing with Coinpunk). I touch this topic a little bit in my concurrency talks at  To steal a line from Terry Tate, this ain't new, baby.
Speaking of punk, if you're in a big city, one workaround is to print out a paper wallet with the payment and hire a bike messenger to deliver it. They're a lot faster than several hours, but they usually charge a higher transaction fee unless you've got some extra PBR laying around you want to get rid of. Or, you know, you could use Coinpunk.
