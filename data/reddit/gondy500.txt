And how are you going to pay 40% capital gains tax? 
Good luck trying to deposit this without setting off red flags.
All profits are subject to tax so 400k to the IRS or jail time.
Did everyone forget about taxes??

Well, no is calculating that in and a lot of traders short term. This year everyone is going to get fucked with. Kind of hard even seeing paying 15% for nothing.
This bothers me because they will go after small and big people the same

It's hard justifying holding this any longer I can buy a jetski or bike for a coin rn. This thing is worthless I'm starting to feel pump and dump
By institutions. I have gold too, it's a real physical asssrt though. This digital, it's not even real.

Only reason this isnt 2,000 right now is because someone hacked and DDOS'ed bitthumb when it was skyrocketing...if it didnt BCH would be at 5000 and this at 2.

Goobye BTC..just liquidated my coinbase account..i'll buy back 25% lower..
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:21:52
Its too early to tell if the guy selling at 5500 is the smart one..
You guys don't have the picture and this could be zero tomm.

This is not a correction...this is a SELLOFF! for BCH!

Think this weekend proved what this coin is really about..
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:34:36
Big difference between PANIC and people fleeing this coin for BCH..BCH is superior in every way...3000 by tommorrow and BTC at 4000..watch.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:26:57
They got hacked or DDOS.d to stop BCH from going to 3k..interesting..
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:32:59
BCH will be 3000 and BTC will be 4000..

Naive and biased kids here with zero investment management experience.

I have more btc than majority of you. Just pointing out the BIAS. True investors don't get butt-hurt.
ETH is vastly superior than BTC. It's a 300 because of no media coverage. Illusion has been cast.
