What a crock of shit that guy is. 
Like you I bought Silver and Gold... but in 2009. Then after a couple years of storing it and have massive anxiety from the idea of me being robbed I wised up and just invested in BTC. 
Gold and Silver is great if you believe the world is going to end. 
but If you believe that there will still be an internet then BTC beats Gold and Silver hands down.

The reason Western Union needs Bitcoin "Regulated like a currency" is that Bitcoin takes Western Unions entire business Model and does it almost for free. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:00:25
Rely? I'm not sure that's the correct term to use. 
Bitcoin existed and functioned even when there wasn't an open market for it. It didn't rely on fiat at all.
I think your question would be better stated "Can a Bitcoin economy exist independently of Fiat currency?"
My answer is Bitcoin doesnt simply come into being and immediately get adopted as a currency of choice. There is a transition period, and yes in that transition period there will be companies who use Bitcoin solely for it's efficiencies in processing payments converting Bitcoin immediately to USD.
But I suspect there will eventually come a time when enough Merchants use Bitcoin and enough people are willing to accept Bitcoin as a salary or payment that it will create a closed loop economy for Bitcoin. 
At that point, Bitcoin starts competing against Fiat and we now must look at the monetary attributes of both to understand which will win out.

What a stunning and insightful interview..
You can see the type of Love only a mother can have for their child beaming out her. She's Truly Amazing. 
As far as the tactics used by the prosecution, For those who have been brought to Bitcoin because of it's technological aspects or for investment purposes rather than the fundamental philosophical roots that inspired it's origination, youre getting a good look at just how vile and corrupt the FEDS are.
And sure you can say that this is because Ross ran a drug market bizarre, but be advised that Bitcoin, which you are now involved in, was designed to undermine and bypass the current Financial and Regulatory system. A system that is ruled by the most ruthless and evil people on the planet. 
If Bitcoin starts to really threaten the establishment (As it is beginning to), we will really see the [veil rise up off of just how wicked, cruel, corrupt and evil the State can be.]( At that point they'll be after you, and the opportunity you had to speak out, to help a monumental case that could have slowed or halted the progression of Tyranny will have passed.

I'm pretty sure that's basically what they do already, except replace Bitcoin with a W.U. ledger and Money transfer system.
I Think W.U could survive but they would radically need to change their Business Model and embrace innovation. They have showed time and time again, They want no part in that.
There is no reason that Western Union can't entirely be replaced with Bitcoin and ATM's in the case you described. 
I send Bitcoin to a friend accross the world he transfers the Bitcoin for local cash currency at a Kiosk or ATM. 
98% cheaper Conversion than Western Union.

I think you are mistaken on modifying their exchange rate. 
If a merchant is using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism and they are asking $20 for a product, if someone pays with Bitcoin and coinbase executes the transaction at the point in which the Bitcoin payed = $20 and the merchant recieves the full $20 where is coinbase making a profit?
If it was the case that Coinbase was manipulating the price, the extra cost would go to the payee not the payor. The Merchant would still receive the full $20. 
It would have to be up to the payor to agree with the exchange rate that is provided by coinbase at the time of purchase. From what I can tell their prices seem always fair.

Allaire was just begging for Regulation in the NY conference.
Not only that, but he was aggressively pushing the idea that Mining cartels should be established and have them regulated by National Governments. 
And to top it off he wanted Central Banks to act as market makers! 
Now, all of the sudden he is saying we should change core protocol to Decentralize mining more? 
Somethings fishy here, What he says in this article makes sense but it's not consistent at all with what he said in the past, not even what 2 months? 
Watch out people there might be ulterior motives at work here. Could be that Allaire wants to try to take over core development of Bitcoin under a guise of making it more Decentralized.  
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:05:08
I just learned a new word that I think is appropriate for this post: **fait accompli**
"a thing that has already happened or been decided before those affected hear about it, leaving them with no option but to accept it."
Bitcoin is the new monetary future, It is the best form of money, it has been decided already because it has been invented and whether people understand that or not it doesnt matter because eventually they will have no option but to accept that reality. 
Which leads me to a great quote: "You can Ignore reality but you can not ignore the consequences of ignoring reality." -Ayn Rand.
sure dismiss Bitcoin as just another Ponzi scheme, In other words ignore the reality of what Bitcoin really is but you can not ignore the consequences of doing so and it will be at your own peril.

Great Cartoon, 
From everything I have seen coming from Allaire and Circle I agree that we should be very wary of this guy. 
Bitcoin was created out of principle, and those principles are hard coded into Bitcoin. As a result Bitcoin undermines the current and corrupt fiat financial system by creating a totally separate transparent and honest one. One that is censorship resistant. Allaire has stated multiple times that the Bitcoin community should abandon those principles which inspired the creation of Bitcoin in the first place. 
Some people want to come to Allaire and Circles defense on the grounds that they will be what makes Bitcoin mainstream. Understand that for Allaire, what it takes to make Bitcoin go mainstream is changing Bitcoin code to appease Central Banks and Governments by giving them more Control. 
Bitcoin will be mainstream regardless if Allaire and Circle are there or not. It is a superior form of Money than anything we have, and the things that make it superior are exactly what Allaire wants to change. 
Bitcoin as it is now, threatens the most ruthless and powerful forces in the world. These are the people Allaire works with and these people are not just about to let the greatest wealth transfer in history happen while they sit idle. 
There is great potential in Bitcoin to make this world a remarkably better place, and there is great potential for it to be a devastating tool for Governments and Central Banks to monitor and control all human activity. 
We should be very cautious and suspicious of anyone who says they want access and control of Bitcoin core development, especially when those people have close ties with the Elites of legacy system.

I always thought that Bitpay could really benefit from outsourcing their client services to enthusiastic Bitcoin folks through an affiliate program. 
Hell, sometimes I feel like I'm a Bitpay rep just by all the restaurants and businesses I talk to about adopting Bitcoin.

Seems so easy, wonder why it hasn't been done.

@_date: 2014-12-31 15:53:26
There is an estimated 100x more "paper gold and silver" as there is physical. This is admitted by the CFTC. In essence it's a giant hypothecation scheme.
I never understood how anyone could argue Gold and Silver market is not rigged when it's a known fact that the derivatives that make the market price have an artificially high supply.
With Bitcoin this type of scheme would be hard to pull of imo because of the transportability and constantly audited public blockchain of Bitcoin. 
People trade Gold and Silver paper contracts because the logistics involved with actually settling in the physical commodity would be very difficult expensive and dangerous to do. but with Bitcoin taking delivery is literally a click of the button. Also verifying the Bitcoin is "on hand" is a very simple task as apposed to Gold and Silver where its never really clear if the comex has enough Gold and Silver in the vault to settle all the paper contracts derived on top of them.

"In the United States, the state of Vermont passed a similar flurry of Red Flag Laws in 1894. The most infamous of the Red Flag Laws was enacted in Pennsylvania circa 1896, when legislators unanimously passed a bill through both houses of the state legislature, which would require all motorists piloting their "horseless carriages", upon chance encounters with cattle or livestock to (1) immediately stop the vehicle, (2) "immediately and as rapidly as possible... disassemble the automobile," and (3) "conceal the various components out of sight, behind nearby bushes" until equestrian or livestock is sufficiently pacified.[1] The bill did not become law, as Pennsylvania's governor used an executive veto."

Yes, you're right. But you're also extremely shortsighted. 
Bitcoin isn't made to interact hand in hand with the current financial system, It's detached from it completely. 
Coinbase and Bitpay are transitional companies, eventually people will transact in a Crypto Currency ONLY making those companies obsolete unless they alter their business model. 
Again, As dollars become increasingly worthless, Retailers will start discounting not only because of the efficiency of the payment system but because they desire Bitcoin over dollars. Meaning that at some point they will not convert their Bitcoin over to the funny green monopoly money we all know as the dollar.

except overstock, they keep 10% in Bitcoin and we actually don't know about the others either as it is internal information.
Besides that there are plenty of businesses that keep their entire Revenue earned from Bitcoin transactions in Bitcoin.
I believe Blockchain doesnt even have a Bank Account and operate 100% in crypto currency. 
As far as your short sided comment, you have to understand that Bitcoin doesnt simply come into being and immediately get adopted as a currency of choice. There is a transition period, and yes in that transition period there will be companies who use Bitcoin solely for it's efficiences in processing payments. There will eventually come a time where there will be enough Merchants accepting Bitcoin and enough people willing to accept Bitcoin as a salary or payment that anyone will be able participate within the economy soley in Bitcoin. 
When that happens, People will value Bitcoin over dollars because Bitcoins attributes as Money are far superior to anything we have today.
Then no one will convert their Bitcoins into dollars. Eventually Thiers law will take affect and your dollars won't be good at all.

If a Discount is offered when you pay with Bitcoin there is no irony. You could go on open market buy Bitcoin just to spend them and achieve discount. If Discount is more than 1% you come out ahead paying with Bitcoin. My guess is we'll probably be seeing Merchants setting prices in their Native currency and Bitcoin. There will be an eventual decoupling as good money will chase out bad money and goods priced in BTC will be much more cheaper.

Perhaps those people who think Merchant adoption is not enough for Bitcoin to succeed are dismissing the incentives created by Merchants through Discounts and Rewards for using BTC. 
6% Discount for just using BTC~! 
This is huge. Really huge. 
Now people have a massive incentive to buy BTC at any price and spend it. If I want to buy something for 100 dollars but can use Bitcoin, spend $95  (1% coinbase fee?) and save 5 %, Well I really dont care if I am buying $95 worth at $500 a Bitcoin or $95 worth at $10,000 a Bitcoin. 
People will start to realize this, and it will be soon. I don't know what will be the critical mass point but if more merchants start offering discounts like these, It might just be that hockey stick moment.

Yes, Yes those are remarkable things. 
But if I may argue, don't encompass the greatest and most overlooked value of Bitcoin.
You and only you can be in complete control of your money.
No one can access your wealth unless you allow them too. No one! Not the Pope, Not the government, nor Military... Not the IRS, Not the President or the prime Minister. No One!
Sure, they can imprison you, beat you, torture you, but those are merely superficial victories for the powers at be if we could even call it that. 
What power wants is unfettered control and before Bitcoin we lived in a world where that was possible. 
Not any longer... 
Power is now becoming distributed with the ability to combine for causes people agree towards all through peaceful and voluntary cooperation.

Why would they be a hinderance? Possible dumping of coins? Whatever effect Satoshi would have by dumping coins would be easily swallowed up in no time. 
If we get to world reserve status, the liquidity in the Bitcoin Market will be huge. As soon as Satoshi's coins moved it would be up on every Financial forum in the world. 
The world would be put on notice and speculators anticipating a dump will have their trading accounts ramped up to swallow up cheap coins if they came. 
Satoshi's coins? IMO No hindrance.  
Here's my guess though on what Satoshi does with those coins... Based on all that I've read from him/her/they most of it will be given away through a Faucet when it hits mainstream adoption. 
Satoshi seems less interested in wealth and more so with changing the world for the better.

It definitely seems like the latter is more likely at this moment... I hope to god im wrong but it definitely seems like a mechanism or a state sponsored apparatus is being built to monitor track and control every financial transaction.

First thing I said when I heard about IRS ruling:
If you see BTC as an investment vehicle it provides clarity and is a good ruling. 
If you see Bitcoin as a currency and your business is structured where it profits as BTC being a currency, this ruling is horrible. 
Not only does it provide a ridiculous burden on the purchaser but now the merchant must fill out a 1099 for every person that buys over $600 worth of stuff in a year from them. 
So basically if you use Bitcoin to shop, even at the local mom and pops bakery down the street they are required by IRS to collect and record all information of purchaser and amounts of transaction. 
Big hurdle for mass adoption, As expected. 
The U.S. is a fascistic totalitarian State.

Great Job..
Glad people are going through thought processes of what a world with a deflationary currency would look like and all the virtues held within it. 
We've been lied to and indoctrinated to learn what is counter intuitive regarding money. Bitcoin is expelling those myths quickly and exposing the fraud which is Fiat inflationary currency. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 05:01:09
very true, but decentralized exchanges will have a huge roll in shaping the crypto currency landscape. 
You might not be able to make nanosecond trades but you'll sure be able to maintain a level of privacy and trade unhindered more than any centralized exchange could offer especially in light of what we see as proposed regulations. 
IMO everything must be decentralized to show those who want to assume control that they have none, this will in turn lead to a compromise on their end(more freedom) when dealing with centralized exchanges.

While I don't see a Resource based economy ever working, at the very least there would be a multi-step process before ever getting there.
The first step of course would be to remove the strangle hold that the current parasitic class of elites have over our resources. 
The best way to do that is Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency...
Once resources are freed from those who hold a monopoly over them, A resource based economy can be tried. But until you break the current financial debt based slave economy, you got no chance of RBE ever happening. 
To sum it up, If your an advocate for a resource based economy, you should be an advocate for Bitcoin.

This is a good point, so a good entrepreneur will figure a way around this or mitigate the risks for those people using the service. Like anonymizing techniques and reputation systems. You order a ride pay bitcoin escro, someone comes by and asks "do you need a ride?" You say "yea thanks". There is no contract created publicly but rather through private crypto platforms. So unless they make asking people if they need a ride illegal, there is no case. There are risks the person wanting a ride bails on the escrow but in that case both lose access to coin. Reputation system will also go a long way to mitigate that risk.

Theres more than enough evidence to suggest that there are facets both in Government and Military that have interest in weather modification.
US Military actually conducted cloud seeding experiments in the Vietnam war called operation popeye. What you think they just stopped there?
Are you telling me that you don't believe facets of the government and Military contractors conduct secret operations and experiments on the public?
I think it's Naive to dismiss anything at this point. The governments around the world are interested in one thing and that is control. Weather modification would seem to fit that agenda and their is more than enough evidence to suggest they are doing exactly that. 
"Chemtrails" is not a conspiracy Theory. It's a proven conspiracy crime. If it's not spraying the atmosphere for weather modification, it's spraying the atmosphere with [agent orange]( , or spraying [St. Louis to in part of Biological weapons tests](
but really I'm not here to argue chemtrails, I'm simply saying that dismissing anything without giving it a critical look first is what is really stupid. It's Naive, Childish and unintelligent. and to do so despite the proven validity in the very nature of the claim just adds insult to injury.

There are different dynamics to Gold/Silver market then to Bitcoin. For one thing there is 100x more "paper gold and silver" as there is physical. This is admitted by the CFTC. In essence it's a giant hypothecation scheme. 
I never understood how anyone could argue Gold and Silver market is not rigged when it's a known fact that the derivatives that make the market price have an artificially high supply. 
With Bitcoin this type of scheme would be hard to pull of because of the transportability of Bitcoin. People trade Gold and Silver paper contracts because the logistics involved with actually settling in the physical commodity would be very difficult expensive and dangerous to do. but with Bitcoin taking delivery is literally a click of the button.

I've thought about this as well but I'm wondering if it's in the same context as you.

I beg to differ,its actually the long view, saying US banning Bitcoin will kill Bitcoin is the short sighted position. 
Will it create an obstruction to Bitcoin flow? Absolutely. 
But like water, Bitcoin will find new channels to flow through. I don't think govs understand the force that has been unleashed and the inertia it has. 
If governments try to stop Bitcoin they will expose just how powerless they really are. It will be an "emporer has no clothes" scenario.
Case in point, Silk Road.. The government used much might and resources to take down SilkRoad but like a Hydra, you cut off one head and three grow in its place. 
Bitcoin is Antifragile, the more opposition, the more confrontation the stronger and more resiliant it will grow.

No, What im saying is that if we had a free market it would solve the issue of drunk driving through means other than government force and violence. 
Perhaps you could drive on a road that made sure drivers were sober before entering, perhaps you could drive on roads that had automated cars, who the fuck knows what solution the free market would come up with but drunk driving would not be an issue if we had a free market. 
Instead we have a Mafia style government system that profits tremendously from people driving drunk. There is no incentive for government to innovate and find solutions to reduce drunk driving.

All paper FIAT money eventually returns to it's inherent value, Zero. It has a 100% failure rate. Average lifespan of roughly 40 years. 
Dollar has been FIAT now for 43 after the U.S. defaulted on it's debts in 1971. 
Only thing that has been keeping the Dollar alive is the fact that the MIC bombs any country that try's to circumvent it as a world reserve currency.

people are looking at this to black and white. The point is not that Miners are selling 100% of mined coins, the point is that the price is not going down despite an inflating money supply. 
Price is remaining stable meaning that there is more or the same amount of demand for Bitcoin as the rate of inflation. That's a healthy stat if you ask me. 
If that demand remains steady when the block reward halving comes about it would seem logical that price would increase if all other variables remain relatively stable (lots of ifs but still logically sound). 
I personally am of the opinion that we will see some type of financial crises before then. Like Cyprus and Greece, people will look to alternatives. The race between nations to debase will lead to the race for citizens to escape. Bitcoin has already penetrated the mainstream subconscious, all it has to do is be there while FIAT falls apart. 
Lots of positive indicators for a price rise if you ask me.

So, First thing to realize is that they laugh because they lack the information you have. 
second is to understand their point of view has been shaped by headlines and sound bites.
My suggestion is next time something like this comes up instead of suggesting Bitcoin, Suggest Bitpay or Coinbase. Don't say the word Bitcoin. They don't need to know that the backbone of how those companies operate is Bitcoin. Eventually they'll come to realize it and see the value and utility of Bitcoin. 
I used to be resentful towards people like this. Don't be, realize that they lack the information necessary to make informed judgement and decisions.
