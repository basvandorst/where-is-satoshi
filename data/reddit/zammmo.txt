When the price of gold gets too low, some mines are no longer profitable and are closed. Gold supply drops, gold becomes more scarce and the price rises again.
This does not apply to bitcoin. Sure, when the bitcoin price gets low, some miners will be switched off but it doesn't change the output of new bitcoins into the market. When there are less miners, difficulty lowers but the output remains the same.

Wow, someone actually understood what bitcoins are and how they work.
You couldn't carry a bitcoin anywhere because the bitcoin isn't actually in the wallet you are carrying, it is only ever held on the blockchain. Just as your money isn't held on your debit card, it's in the bank ((well, 10% of it may be in the bank))

You have absolutely no idea how the system works.
A bond is a loan. It is an IOU, a promise to pay. Government owes the principle plus interest on every bond issued.
The government has a zero balance. The only way they get money is to issue a bond. The tax receipts the government receives must pay that bond, plus interest. Then the government issues more bonds, they are purchased by the banks, sold to the FED, the FED creates money to buy them and the banks pay the money to the US Treasury and the government has money to spend. Rinse and Repeat.
You made the example of BoA and hedge funds and the mortgage repayments go to pay the hedge funds. This is no different. Replace the mortgage with bonds and the hedge funds with the FED. It's the same principle.
@_date: 2014-10-27 11:56:21
Ugh... and where do the bonds that the FED buys/sells come from? You are missing a big piece of the puzzle.
The FED can not issue bonds. They are issued by the US Treasury.
The purchase of government bonds by the banks and FED is what funds the government.
This has nothing to with the FED being a government agency or private, it is just how the system works and it is not debatable.

Satoshi, if you ever read this, I want to thank you. Bitcoin has changed my life for the better in ways I couldn't have possibly imagined. It has given me a leg up in a world that prevented me from achieving anything that would have enabled me to be successful.
I now live comfortably, I don't have to worry about bills coming through my door. I can eat good food and take care of my son's health. I have been able to go out and buy the car I could only dream about owning, paid in full, no money owed.
Previously, I felt like I was drowning under the stresses and demands the modern world inflicts on people. Now I feel free, I feel in control and for the first time in many many years, I am truly happy.

If it wasn't for the PBOC regulation and mandates, the price of bitcoin could well still be priced at over $1000. Even though the bitcoin infrastructure has increased massively since the December crash, the price of bitcoin has been on a steady decline. Every time the price starts to recover, there is a crash (apart from Gox, every crash has been ignited in China) and more investors and chances for widespread adoption are lost. Whether the damage China is causing is permanent is yet to be seen, there is no guarantee from anyone that we will ever see another all time high or even $700 again.
So yes, China is very much damaging the price and with that, massively hindering the adoption of bitcoin. Every time China release a new mandate restricting bitcoin which in turn causes a panic sell, regardless if people hold or sell, they lose money. You may not like it but it is a fact.

That is not true. The moment money is deposited in a bank, ownership of that money is transferred to the bank. If ownership of deposited funds remained with the depositor, it would be illegal for banks to trade with or loan deposits as the bank would be selling/using someone else's property.
Personal/Business account holders are classed as unsecured creditors to the bank. The bank is a debtor to the depositor. The funds in these accounts are owned by the bank, not the account holder. The funds only become the property of the account holder when a request for withdrawal is made but that request must be made before bankruptcy is declared. In the event of bankruptcy, as an unsecured creditor, the account holder is only entitled claim funds that are in the bank after all the secured creditors have been paid. In this situation, an unsecured creditor is likely to receive nothing.
This is why the FDIC was created but their funds would not be sufficient to cover a systemic collapse.

Thank you for your input into this thread. It has been very eye-opening. Although Wal-Mart have no plans to implement bitcoin, just the fact you guys are considering it shows have far we have come. It also shows how far we have to go. We have only scratched the surface of the potential services bitcoin as to offer. Bitcoin as a method of payment is just the tip of the iceberg. Companies that have the vision to see this potential and are able to integrate it into their business model will reap the rewards. If Wal-Mart's vision really is to bring financial services to the unbanked, you guys need to be grabbing hold of bitcoin with both hands!

Keep telling yourself that. If you bought 10btc today for $5000 and the price dropped by $100/btc, sure you still have 100btc but the value of your bitcoin has decreased, along with your wealth. The portion of wealth that you have lost, will have been transferred to someone else.
It is entirely the same if the price of gold drops, the value of your gold holdings drops with it, you lose wealth. If the price of your house drops, it does not have as much value and your wealth is decreased. It is nothing to do with being a bad trader, that is how markets work.

The government auctioning it's debt is exactly how they get a loan. A bond is a debt, it's a promise to pay and it that bond/debt is secured on the tax payer..
We all live in debt based money systems. All currency was borrowed into existence. The money the government receives from your taxes is not how the government pays for services, your tax money is used to pay the government debt for the money it borrowed.
The treasury sells bonds to obtain money. The bonds are purchased by large banks, foreign central banks and the FED. There is interest due on every bond that is purchased and the interest on the bond is paid by the tax payer.
The FED doesn't have any money on deposit, when they buy a bond it creates currency to do it. This is why they are not a reserve, they have no reserves. Any money they need, they simply create it.




This newly created currency is given to the treasury, who then gives it to the government to spend. That money is then spent into the economy and repaid to the bond holders, with interest, by your taxes.

It's a nice app, easy enough to set orders and view your previous trades. You can see the current market price and spread for the day. It will give you a QR code deposit address. Aside from that, it doesn't do much else.

You own an investment firm, not a bank. This law only applies to banks, not all financial institutions. If you used your customer funds to pay your debts, it is classed as a tort of conversion, using someone else's property for your own use. To use your clients funds for anything other than the intended use of those funds, ie investment, would be misappropriation and would constitute a crime.
Google "Foley v Hill" and you will see that this case law, even as old as it is, it's still used even today. It is still used all over the world but especially in the US and UK. The most recent example was the collapse of MF Global. Jon Corzine used customer funds to pay his banks debts, no charges of any kind were ever filled against him. When asked, Eric Holder stated Corzine had done nothing wrong. Indeed he had not. It is impossible to steal your own money.

If only that were true. All of the bank's customers are unsecured creditors to the bank, it's not just the corporate customers. The bail-ins very much apply to customer deposits. The Bank of England, The FED and the BIS wrote the legislation for the Cyprus bail-ins and just as in Cyrus. Should there be a bail-in scenario, all bank customers would have a one-off 'tax' applied to their account just as happened in Cyprus. The money is 'taxed' from customers accounts so they are unable to claim it back under the deposit insurance.
I provided the document from the Bank of England and Federal Deposit Insurance which states 'converting a sufficient amount of the unsecured debt from the original creditors of the failed company into equity'. The 'unsecured debt' is the deposits made by all bank customers, not just corporations. The sophisticated investors or institutional investors would have secured debt.

The words 'MtGox' and 'fully functional' have had no place in the same sentence for a very long time. Recent current events will have done nothing to change that. The best that can be hoped is they have found a work around to the txid issue.

We have still yet to hear news from China about the outcome of the exchanges losing their Bank accounts. Deposits were supposed to be stopped on the 14th and I think 7 days later the accounts were to be closed completely.
Bobby Lee stated he would ignore the mandate set by the PBOC and continue to trade as normal. As great as that sounds, the PBOC can not be ignored. The Chinese exchanges are treading water and holding off any kind of bad news so their business isn't effected.
What speaks volumes for me is that the Chinese exchanges have not released any official notices stating that they have found a suitable work around to the PBOC mandate. The scare of the 14th came and went and nothing happened.
I have no doubt we will see insider trading before any news is released, either positive or negative.

Again, you have not read the comment I responded to. The previous posters states that the FED's products are sold by the Department of Treasury. This is not true. The FED sells it's products directly, and without any government oversight, to national and foreign banks.

Here is another - 
The treasury has no involvement in who the FED sells its products and they don't have to answer to the government when asked to declare their business.

A lot of the Bitcoin that the hacker took, weren't a loss to bitstamp, they have been lost by the people that sent them. People kept sending Bitcoin in large sums to the comprised wallet long after bitstamp locked the site down, these Bitcoin went directly into the hackers pocket. Bitstamp's actual loses are much lower than what has been reported.
Bitstamp have had investments with large cash injections during 2014 and in May were independently audited which showed they held full reserves.

Sorry but that is absolutely not true. I have had property seized and even though I proved my innocence the property was confiscated.
I had a £10k bank loan to buy a car. On the way to buy the car, I was stopped by the police and found with the £10k. They took the money. I went to court with my bank loan agreement but the court confiscated the money on the grounds that it may be used for crime in the future, even though I had committed no crime. They claimed having a debt proved I did not have any means to have £10k, seriously.
Magistrates are a kangaroo court run by the police.

Indeed, they may have the money and know-how to start over but how often could any company take that kind of hit? All their stock and assets being reduced to junk overnight. Have you seen pictures of of the size of their server farms? Do they keep those farms active and mine BCH, or do they let BCH die, scrap all the hardware and start over? Changing the PoW would be a very painful experience for them. Maybe it will make them realise their place in the BTC chain. The value of BTC is not caculated by it's hash rate, it is given by the users/community and the talent in the dev team. 
A change of PoW would level the playing field, give other chip manufacturers the opportunity to enter the game who maybe feel at preset, the field is stacked against them. It could stop all the hash power being concentrated with one bad player company and decentralise it over several companies. 
I would feel bad for people in the community who have invested in an ASIC miner but unfortunately, this would be done to retain Bitcoins integrity and prevent a hostile takeover.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:18:48
Actually, it is true. It is the miners that are responsible for high fees, no-one else.
Miners dismiss transactions with low fees and only package txs with higher fees. It benefits them financially do to so. This is why sometimes you see empty blocks even though there is a huge amount of txs in the mempool. Why doesn't the mempool get cleared for these empty blocks? Miners choose which transactions go into each block, they cherry pick the best and leave the rest. This forces people to use high fees or their transaction is buried in spam. Gradually, the fees have crept higher and higher. They will stay high until miners will package low fee txs into blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:27:00
Every empty block that is mined disproves what you claim.
Miners cherry pick the txs with the largest fees. Any tx with a fee under what they accept, they ignore. If this were not true, there would be no empty blocks while the mempool holds transactions. 
Yes, miners want this situation. It forces fees to rise which benefits them and no-one else. There is no-one else that gains anything at all from higher fees. They are holding bitcoin users to ransom, either they pay the higher fees or transaction will not get processed.
Bigger blocks will do nothing to lower fees and clear the mempool as long as miners cherry pick the transactions that go into the blocks, the problem will persist.

The mempool is being spammed by certain mining pools. They sacrifice a small amount of the tx fees they receive to send the spam transactions, so it essentially costs them nothing to do.
Transactions like this - 
The only way I see to stop it is hit the miners where it hurts. Change the Proof of Work. They will then no longer be able to switch their mining power between BTC and BCH to play the difficulty changes.

I think he was sarcastically pointing out that another player, a bigger player, coming into mining only serves to further centralise mining, leaving bitcoin more open for a corporate/government/regulation takeover.
Anything that puts mining ASIC production in the hands of one company is bad for bitcoin.
It is inevitable for bitcoin to survive as we know it, there will need to be a PoW change to kill ASIC mining. And then subsequent random changes to ensure GPU mining remains the only option, thus ensuring anyone with a graphics card can mine.
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:55:18
Yes, it will 'change the game' but will it really help decentralisation?
We will be replacing one chip manufacturer for another larger chip manufacturer, putting competitive ASIC mining chip production out of reach of many companies. With all likelihood of mining becoming even more centralised, controlled by big businesses and open to government regulation. Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

Clearly you didn't lose anything on the BFX hack. It made no difference if you sold your BFX tokens or held them, you lost big time. No-one who lost BTC in the hack had any chance to recoup their loses in full.
Yes, BFX have re-bought all the tokens they issued. It took them a year to do so. By that time, BTC had risen 4 times it value from when the hack happened. So, my BTC that Finex lost was replaced with dollars worth a fraction of their value. BFX didn't replace the BTC that was lost with BTC, I got around $300 per BTC, when BTC was trading at $1400.
They chose to give their customers a haircut for their own incompetent multisig security.
And before anyone chimes in that they didn't have to give you anything back... BitStamp was also victim to a hack. They made anyone who lost, whole. Repaid the full amount in BTC.

If the FED was part of the government, then why isn't the FED's balance sheet included in the governments debt? The FED's balance sheet would wipe out America's $16trillion debt. They are entirely separate, and for a reason.
You do not have a clue what you are talking about. Only 2 of the 12 FED board members are selected by the president. The federal reserve do not give their profits to the government, in fact it is quite the opposite... they charge the government interest for lending them money. They make money from the government, not make money for the government.
I suggest you do some research about the history of central banks, who set them up and who control them. Simply, read the banks charters, or the Federal Reserve Act if you don't have time to do the research.

Are you saying that during the trade, the sellers account was hacked and the hacker attempted to cancel the trade so they could steal the BTC?
In that case, the money would have been sent to the real account holders bank details, the trade would have been fully sanctioned by the real seller and now that the real seller has his account back, the trade could continue as normal. The 'hackers' will have got away with nothing.
But the real seller is still holding the BTC in escrow and has refused to complete the trade. Why would LBC reduce the amount of BTC in the trade?
The account was never hacked. The seller tried to wriggle out of the trade due to the price increase. Say you buy BTC at $150 and then sell it at $200 for a $50 profit. If the price during that time increases to $300 you actually lose money because it costs you more to buy the BTC back than what you sold it for. This is a risk every seller takes. Buyers also run the risk of buying BTC and the same thing happening in reverse... the price drops after the sale and the buyer loses money.

I think you are missing that you don't need to choose either Bitcoin or credit cards as a payment method, you can have both. If your customers feel they need the protection from the products you sell them, they can have it by using credit cards. People who use bitcoin, know they will not have consumer protection, they accept this risk but I am sure you are a reputable business owner and they will not need the protection.
The more payment methods you can offer, the wider your customer base becomes.
Bitcoin's stability will come in time. Every currency that has ever existed has had it's ups and downs, none more than when it was in it's infancy. The more bitcoin is used as a currency instead of a speculative get-rich-quick scheme, the better it will be.

I have read the law, in great detail. Central Banks are not part of the government. 2 of the 12 members on the Federal Reserve board are appointed by the President, the other 10 are private bankers. 2 of 10 is not a majority.
The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, it has no relationship with the government, as said by Alan Greenspan (Chairman of the Federal Reserve). - 
The Bank of England - On 6 May 1997, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy.
Governments have no say in how central banks set economic policy. If the central banks were a government agency, they would have to follow the policies set by the President/Prime Minister... central banks are entirely private, their profits are not given to the government and their authority is superseded by no-one.

The transaction was made via PingIt and PingIt has nothing to do with either of your bank accounts... checking your bank accounts to see if payments have been sent or received proves nothing, either way.
You need to check if you sent the payment on your PingIt account, not your bank account. The funds leaving your bank account only show that you credited your PingIt account, not the sellers.
If you sent the payment via PingIt, the payment will be in the sellers PingIt, not his bank account. Only he can send the money from his PingIt to his bank account. If the money didn't transfer from his PingIt to his bank account due to bank problems, it is entirely something he needs to sort out between Barcleys and his bank.
Also, you need to contact a BitBargain admin about this, as the seller is not allowed to request you pay the money to a different account, it is strictly against the rules. You would have got this issue resolved in a few seconds had you contacted BitBargain support.

It is fundamentally impossible for bank runs to happen if a bank has 100% reserves. Banks lending money that is owed to their customers and causing their reserves to fall below 100% is factional reserve banking. I bought up Cyprus because that was a case where the deposit insurance did not secure the bank creditors deposits. If you look into what happened in Cyprus, it was the ECB that ordered the insolvent banks to take the depositors funds to pay their debts even though the banks had the option to borrow the money they required from elsewhere.


I am not sure where you got this from. I did give you a link to a video that explains the process which I will assume you did not bother to watch (it was only 15mins long). Customers of the bank that deposit money in that bank are classed as unsecured creditors and the bank is a debtor to those customers. The money deposited is owned by the bank, not the customer and the banks can legally use that money in anyway they see fit. When the Bank of England said "by exchanging or converting a sufficient amount of the unsecured debt from the original creditors of the failed company into equity" they refer to the bank as the failed company, the unsecured debt being the customer accounts and the original creditor is the person who deposited money in the bank. The quote I gave is far from moot, it is the policy in effect by the world's largest central banks, BoE, FED and ECB.
Booms and busts are caused, and has always been caused, by controlling the supply of money. Before banks existed, this was done by the goldsmiths. Although, the US may not have always had a central bank, the US has never know a time without banks. Before your independence, your money was controlled by the Bank of England and the King.
As for the President of the Bank of England's words being hyperbolic propaganda, I can give you similar quotes from some of the greatest men to ever walk this earth, such as the founding fathers, presidents, other world leaders, popes, economists like Milton Friedman and even the bankers themselves. I study the people who knew far more about money and how it works than I ever will.

As rightly said, it is already too late. The US government are not the centre of the world and every day they lose more of their influence over other governments. Bitcoin is a currency in it's own right and even if the US government were to do something stupid like banning bitcoin, the rest of the world will continue to use it.
The actions of the US Government have actually helped bitcoin. The uncontrollable debt they have accumulated can never be paid off. The dollar will collapse along with the US economy, probably by Feb 2014. When that happens, the FED will start sanctioning 'bail-ins' and Americans will be rushing to Bitcoin as a safe haven for their wealth. What the Cyrus bail-in did to bitcoin will look like a drop in the ocean.

I don't believe bitcoin will replace gold. They both have unique properties that work in conjunction with each other. Bitcoin is as much of a threat to gold as the dollar was.
I believe it can replace currency. Most of today's money transfers happen electronically and Gold can not be transmitted through the internet. If they make Gold certificates (e-gold) that can be used online, that is no different to printing money, so the system will ultimately fail.
Bitcoin challenges the central banks monopoly and control of money. People will always need gold for a long term store of wealth.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:18:31
Whether or not you think this is a bubble, I think depends on the degree you believe in Bitcoin as a currency. The 'bubble' will be determined on where Bitcoin's true value is, currently Bitcoin is still finding it's value.
If when 1btc was worth $5, you had told people Bitcoin would rise to $100, it would have been said it was a bubble but with hindsight, the dip that occurred in the market on it's rise to $100 was just that, a dip.. there was no bubble as the price rose back to $100 and now, unless something fundamentally terrible happens with the technology, we will never see that price again. 
I believe Bitcoin's true value is far above the price we are seeing today and although on it's journey to that value there will be the occasional dip in price, where the pessimists will cry out "see we told you it was a bubble". These dips will be temporary, the market will correct itself and bitcoin will then surpass it's previous high.
There will be a day when we see 1btc worth $100,000... that is, if on that day the dollar still exists. Bitcoin will go much further than to the moon.

So to defend central banks, you talk of hardships suffered due to the actions taken by central banks during the times when central banks were in control of the currencies? I have studied the history of banking in great depth.
There would be no such thing as bank runs if banks did not operate upon a foundation of legalised fraud called fractional reserve banking.
Bank robberies took place due to a lack of security and in later times, a poorly equipped police force. These days, banks are robbed by the bankers themselves which is then left for the tax payers to bail them out. FDIC? Tell that to the people of Cyprus. It is a myth to think that the FDIC or similar could payout on a complete banking collapse and as the average person is considered as an unsecured creditor to the bank, the chances of them claiming any money back should a bank go bankrupt is slim to none. Bail-ins are what will happen in the future for insolvent banks, this is now the policy of central banks. See paragraph 13 of this Bank of England document - 


If you don't understand what that means, please watch this - 
Boom and bust economies are the product of a central banks policies and regulation. They purposely control the money supply by inflating and deflating the currency in order to extract wealth from the citizens.
The start of the great depression was characterised by a massive contraction of the money supply by the central banks which then led to a run on banks. No different than what is being experienced in parts of Europe today.
For a crash course on the history of money and central banks, please take a look at this -The Money Masters - 
Sir Josiah Stamp, President of the Bank of England does not agree with you either.

Everyone is wrong sometimes... unfortunately, Peter Schiff has been blinded by his gold. He really needs to research his facts.


Bitcoin's are made exactly the same way as gold, you mine it. The supply of both increase gradually, neither can be printed. In that sense, it is not like fiat as it can't be artificially inflated
Gold is the oldest and safest store of wealth but it does not fit into the digital age in a practical way. Bitcoin will work perfectly alongside gold after all the fiat currencies collapse.
Bitcoin is still finding it's value and the value will be decided by how widely it gets used around the world. Bitcoin is far from it's true vale and it will be a lot higher than 200.
People are aware that the banking system is based on fraud and was created to deprive people of their wealth. It is a new age and there is a need for a new currency system, bankers are no longer required.

Does Gold get valued in grams because it costs more than $1000 for an ounce? How about oil, will that get valued in litres when a barrel goes over $500? Or any other commodity? No, they will all be valued in their respective standard units of measure, not matter what price they reach. This is the way things have always been done, this is why we use universal units of measure.
The dollar is a standard unit of measure for currency, just as ounces are for precious metals. 1BTC is the standard measure of bitcoin and needs to be measured as BTC, the single unit of measure, so simple comparisons can be made to other assets.
Soon nothing will be valued in dollars because the currency will get hyper inflated into oblivion.

I thought the part where they mentioned GCHQ were going to expand the amount of tor nodes it has was quite worrying

I find it interesting how people like this who have attained high ranking positions in the world of finance feel they are able to redefine what 'currency' means, like it is open to debate. Statements like this make me feel like this guy is using his position to deliberately mislead people or he has no idea what he is talking about.
noun, plural cur·ren·cies.
1. something that is used as a medium of exchange; money
Bitcoin is most definitely used as a medium of exchange. It fits all the attributes of a currency: It is a medium of exchange, it is divisible, portable, durable, a unit of account and it is fungible.
A currency does not need to be legal tender, printed by a bank or backed by a government to be classified as a currency, this is a myth. The official legal tender fiat currencies of this world are are backed by nothing but faith, no different to bitcoin. Ask the people of countries that have been through hyperinflation how much that faith was worth.
Money is what ever people choose to accept to use as money. If what you are holding has value to me, it can be used to trade.

I just tried to buy something from a Chineese website. My credit card was not accepted because VISA was US backed.

When BTCGuild was touching on the 51% share, Eleuthria raised the mining fees to persuade some miners to join other pools. Maybe if the fees were lowered slightly, some miners would return and help restore equilibrium.

Wow, that guy on the 'edit 2' link called bitcoin a reserve currency. I have never really thought about it in that respect but he is right. It may not be the official reserve currency but it does have all the characteristics of one.

Can anyone in Wisconsin confirm this?
How come this has been posted for a day and had only a couple posts? Not even any calling 'fake'?
This thread doesn't appear if I search reddit for it, I can only find it on imgur

I know, I was just venting :)
