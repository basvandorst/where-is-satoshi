So what exactly is the issue? The same person purchasing the same bundle multiple times?
Is that a problem?
All of the games are DRM free, so someone could theoretically pay once and upload to mega.
What exactly is the problem with paying customers?
I assume I'm missing something important

Unless they're mining I don't see how they can profit from high network fees.
They make profit off of trading fees - by those coins are just moving around in a database, nothing to do with the network

Don't worry too much about being left in the dust. The other coins with cheaper and faster transactions are functions if the fact that they have less users. Look what happened in a few days in ethereum. All blockchains will have similar scaling issues . As for cryptocurrencies that are not blockchains... I'm not holding my breath

LTC(which activated segwit first) and BTC. I saw some nose about cross chain swaps but they will each have their "own" lightning network.
Ethereum will potentially have a similar network, Raiden(incomplete).

Yeah...DWave is in my city. They like to play up the Quantum Computing angle, and there are even startups writing "quantum software" now..
They have not shown that they have built a quantum computer. More (lots of it) information can be found in Scott Aaronson's blog.
It's all just marketing. Might go somewhere one day, but not soon. And honestly probably not by them

what are the implications of people syncing the blockchain like this? They will be syncing less often and trusting the people who broadcast it, could they not distribute a falsified blockchain to people? For example, if someone posted an alternate blockchain torrent and somehow tricked the majority into using it.

You had to wait for 6 confirmations? That's awful.  I've made a few bitcoin purchases for digital goods such as the humble bundle and it was instantaneous.  I only wait for 1 confirmation when I'm selling people hundreds of dollars worth of coin /dealing with people who are unfamiliar with bitcoin

I live in a part of North America with very cheap electricity(Hydro).
I currently mine with a single Antminer @ ~180Gh/s.
Where do people find space with enough breakers to run this many machines for a reasonable price?
It seems that you can only run around 3 Antminers on a 15A /120V circuit.
Where do you find places that have this much power, even if you could afford it?

Hey, thanks for your great reply. I think the part I'm a bit confused if what exactly differentiates the free client from the one on the 21c computer. Is it just that the non free client is configured to use the mining chip?

"I would like to become a member", "applications", ... What the fuck am I reading?
Bitcoin is permissionless. If these people had good ideas they could join the other 100+ contributors...
@_date: 2016-03-12 00:20:02
Neat. What exactly is the technical limitation requiring the 21c computer as opposed to, say, a raspberry pi with the 21c library. I know there is the mining chip but what else? What happens even you do a "21 flush"?

As a software engineer in a non Bitcoin related field, I just want to emphasize that the way the BU devs act is indicative of (and common amongst) inexperienced engineers.
All legacy code has smells, you will always want to rewrite code. It takes experience to know when you shouldn't - to take the time to plan a way forwards. 
That's the planning and experience I see whenever I check the core GitHub - and it looks like thankless work if you log in to Reddit.

I've been meaning to ask this with the whole BCH thing, but this also seems like a great time!
I've had my trezor for about 3 years. I now want to upgrade firmware. I have my seed...but I want to be SURE that my seed works before doing an upgrade. Does the firmware upgrade verify the seed? If the firmware update goes awry, will I need my seed, or does the firmware upgrade not touch that part of the memory?

Thanks for your response. One thing I'm curious about is what happens if and when Blockstream is acquired or goes bankrupt and a third party gets the patents(think Yahoo or RIM). What happens if that company wants to use the patents offensively? Does the DPL help with that?

I'm curious, as a Canadian user, would my transaction history be turned over in the event you lost the case?
On a side note - I logged in after a hiatus and can't figure out how to deposit to my CAD wallet. Did you not get another payment processor after vogogo called it quits, or am I blind?

The governor general is appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the prime Minister, and is her representative. When a party wishes to form government, the representative either assents or dissents. They never say no. It is generally accepted if they ever say no we will just recommend a new GG or cut ties totally. 
The only real thing the Queen does is tour infrequently and eat up some percentage of our taxes. 
In 1982 Canada "patriated" its Constitution, transferring the country's highest law, the British North America Act, from the authority of the British Parliament — a connection from the colonial past ­— to Canada's federal and provincial legislatures.
Basically any laws that sound antiquated were written a long time ago, and now exist in the above context because it would be a load of work to change all the wording with no real effect.

It is considered abnormal, but I really don't think it's as uncommon some people believe. I think a lot of my friends were taught similarly.
I believe a typeface with proper kerning should look "right" with one space. The are probably plenty of people who are trying to approximate the look of properly set text with bad tools?

As per the last paragraph, are you saying that you have to do more work to support more phones(that have the functionality), or that more phones will continue to come out with the functionality.
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:13:27
to be fair, I was born in the late 1980s and I used two spaces after a period until I got to university. I had older parents and teachers tell me it was proper - didn't find out it was abnormal until much later.

Afaik, the only way to make an "instant buy" was to first full up your "cad wallet".

As I mentioned, P2PKH is used, not P2PK, for this very reason. The public key is not included in the transaction - perhaps your are thinking of an address ( of type P2PKH)
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:06:45
At a glance: it's subscribing to a list of unconfirmed transactions and keeping a running total of input and output addresses
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:34:46
All addresses have public keys, but not all addresses ARE public keys. P2PKH addresses are hashed public keys. It was designed this way on purpose for the reasons you mention in your post.

@_date: 2018-12-16 19:51:05
Surely you know  P2PKH was chosen instead of P2PK for this reason.
Or do you think someone will enumerate all possible valid public keys? If they could do that they could enumerate private keys instead.
QC is not magic
