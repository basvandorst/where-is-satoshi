Nice! Have been using Libertyx for over a year now. Anyone know how to find one of the ATMs that are enabled?

The fee in their app said 8%, and that's what it ended up being. I usually use the Coinbase app where they charge me like a 3.5% fee which sounds nice, but when you click "buy" in their app the bitcoin rate shoots up 4-5%, so not terrible when comparing the two, esp since this was instant.  As far as KYC, since I only bought $50 it only made me confirm an SMS to my phone.

I like that they went for the WSJ article look.

Does anyone have an update on this?

Do they make actual hardware? Couldn't find anything on their site.

Seems complex

I think improving the Lightning UX should come way before that. If we had a bunch of mobile clients like we do bitcoin wallets it would be much easier to push.

Also, who?

Yes, it's super simple to use too.

Maybe there's still some life in bitpay yet.
