I'm one of the creators of Burner Phone (along with Mike) -- we've actually been building this for a while now, but after the news broke on Thursday about all the NSA stuff we rapidly finished up our MVP website and launched the thing to take advantage of the press stuff going on -- this isn't an overnight deal.

Sorry, I completely missed this. I'll remove the post. Please excuse me!

Shameless plug, I wrote an app a few days ago that allows you to easily buy / sell / transfer bitcoin if you're a coinbase user:

I'm a huge CoinBase fan. Also: shameless plug here, but I built a command line CoinBase application for those of you using Linux or Mac OS: 
You can use it to buy, sell, transfer, manage your CoinBase account :)

Hey, most of the links there are not affiliate links (fyi). I figured I'd include some to help cover the expense of the domain name, but I doubt it'd ever even accomplish that much. The earnings from something like this would be extremely small.
I didn't throw any ads on the site or anything like that as there's honestly no desire to make money from this thing, just a passion project.

So, I'm a relatively new bitcoin user here. One of the problems I had when getting started was finding a list of ways to actually earn bitcoin (by doing crowdsourced work, completing those captcha challenges on various sites, etc.). It seemed like there were a million options, half of which didn't work.
I put together this website as a curated list of the best free bitcoin resources for new bitcoin users, which I plan to maintain.
Since I'm assuming most of the readers here are experienced bitcoin users who have (at one point or another) used the freebie sites to get started, I was hoping to see what you all think, and if you have any feedback.
Thanks for your time.

So, the way it works apparently is that they hold the order for you (thereby keeping it off the public ledger) -- which lets you place orders for whatever you want without affecting the price of Bitcoin.
They also say that it works for all the exchanges they support, pretty nifty IMO.
