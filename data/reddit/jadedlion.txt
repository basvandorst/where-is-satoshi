This is insulting to the readers intelligence. Trully depressing. Every unit of Bitcoin has a visible different history. 1BTC != 1BTC. Not fungible. The only way to fungibility is erasing history. Your attitudes just enforces my belief that Bitcoin will never have mandatory complete privacy on it's base layer which is good news for other projects that fullfil this need.

It scales worse but don't exaggerate. It's not 10 times worse. In fact unlike Bitcoin Monero never had scaling issues. To scale globally txs will have to go on a second layer anyway. But nice try at spin. Devs were concerned with more pressing issues. Bulletproofs will come next network upgrade making it scale 80% better. When the time comes scaling solutions like lightning or sidechains will be implemented. So far neither scales globally.

Nobody is going to wait 10 years when there is a perfectly capable alternative. Calling monero a privacy coin is misleading. What is not private is not coin/currency/money/cash. It's used as digital cash money. The term also implies that privacy should not be default. That's very wrong since only privacy crypto can be sound money.

It's not private at all. All transaction are publicly available on the chain. Chain analysis techniques will become efficient and cheap enough for everyone. You just have to tie a couple of identities to addresses and since most buy on aml/kyc exchanges that won't be an issue.

No it won't. The october hard fork will add bulletproofs thus making txs and fees at least 80% lower. Monero will just hard fork as need arises to new tech. Neither can scale globally so it's irrelevant really that Bitcoin can scale a bit more. They both need L2 for world wide use. Unprivate coins are not coins. they are assets. Privacy is a constitutional right. Speech is also a constitutional right in most 1st world countries. Monero won't go away. I almost dream of a ban making monero elite money thus super expensive.

Not implementing mandatory privacy at the protocol level was a fatal flaw of the Bitcoin paper which killed Bitcoin's fungibility and will forever prohibit its use as cash money. Everybody having the ability to snoop on random people's txs is such a bad idea.. I mean has anybody heard of Snowden and how much information you can infer about somebody just by looking at metadata?
[As a comparison I attach the Monero block explorer rich list.](
And before you tell me that Bitcoin can theoretically implement all of Monero's privacy features through hard forks do you honestly believe there will be consensus for something like that in any meaningful time?
Another gripe of mine is mining. Bitcoin was supposed to be democratic. While everybody has a gpu laying around to mine Monero because Bitmain was brickd' by the last network upgrade PoW change  for Bitcoin I have to buy some expensive hardware from bumfuck China that will reach end of life as soon as it's delivered.

Segwit just kicks the can down the road. Bitcoin does not have a dynamic solution like Monero.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:36:33
You're missing my point. It is true that Bitcoin  is a bit more scalable than Monero because Bitcoin is lacking some fundamentals like privacy and fungibility which translates to a higher tx size in Monero but neither Bitcoin nor Monero can scale globally on L1 so let's not play semantics here. When the time comes Monero will also have L2 solutions just like Bitcoin.

The goal is not to kill banks. Banks provide capital to entrepreneurs on a free market or run custodial services for people. A vital function.

Do you have a hard-on for encroachments of freedom buddy? Government was born is exploitation and conquest. They are the embodiement of courruption so I don't put too much weight when they say that criminals use Monero. They said exactly the same thing about Bitcoin. Criminals use everything... it's a really bad argument. 
They don't have to buy the privacy argument. You don't have to buy the law of gravity to die if you jump off the 10th floor. The same is true for unfungible goods that will never be money. Every money starting with salt and seashells to gold and fiat cash is fungible. Building privacy layers on top is such a costly and bad idea. We have the internet protocols as an example of that.
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:14:17
Bitcoin can't scale either on L1 but at least Monero has a dynamic blocksize for now. Invisible inflation is not possible as the supply can at all times be [verified]( It's true Monero had a critical bug but afaik Bitcoin also had some in the early phases. And regarding the Bitcoin flavour of the month jab. Don't be disingenuous. Monero is not just a flavor of the month, it's a serious technical rival of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:25:45
Yep. I don't really understand why people cling on to the horse buggy when the car is here it works and you can move easily. Monero tech is years ahead.

It was only during the rise of the prosperous modern industrial systems and during the rule of the gold standard, that over a period of about two hundred years (in Britain from about 1714 to 1914, and in the United States from about 1749 to 1939) prices were at the end about where they had been at the beginning. During this unique period of monetary stability the gold standard had imposed upon monetary authorities a discipline which prevented them from    abusing their powers, as they have done at nearly all other times.
