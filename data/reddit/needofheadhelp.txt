Forking is not what he is saying is scammish. It's forking a coin and literally ripping off it's name to seem like the coin you forked off of. Which is totally against the spirit of open source.

Yea and these people are spitting in the face of the spirit of open source by choosing names that obviously are there to steer people in the wrong direction and create confusion. He never said you can't fork it.
I highly doubt he would be complaining if someone made a LTC fork that had a an actual different name.

Guys he's not saying all forks of LTC are scams jesus learn what commas are for! He is saying any coin forking and calling itself Litecoin {scam name} is misleading and literally goes against the spirit of forking and open source.
He's not saying "Any fork of litecoin is a scam", it's "any fork of Litecoin, calling itself litecoin something". If someone forked LTC and gave it a completely new name like razer or some stupid shit he wouldn't care.
These people naming it this way aren't forking in the spirit of improvement even if they end up improving the coin when they rip off the name. Forks in any other avenue of programming that take a name like this would be considered fucking bad form.

I have over 25k, half of that bought around 17k, I'm holding no matter what.

Dude investing is not for making money now, it's long term. The coin will come back up but you never should have invested anything with the intent of making profit quick.

Buy and sit. You can't time the market. 90% of day traders lose and the other 10 are using good algorithms and know what they're doing at a high level. You're investing in the belief that bitcoin is a good value and will go up.
So you hold up till it goes up to whatever profit you wanted and withdraw. Some will kill me for that last statement because yes it could go up and up and up and one day you're kicking yourself because you didn't become a millionaire. 
But again you can't time the market, so you never know, pick your number that you truly believe it can get to and you would be satisfied with and hold until you get there.

This is my first lesson in HODL, I bought at 20k @ 5400.  This is my first experience with the down but this is how I become a hardened HODLer right?!
I shall hodl through hell or high water! (And buy more if it dips into the 5000s, maybe lower!)

Bitcoin being directly taken by a big name company like Tesla is good for adoption of it being a usable currency instead just a store of value. Yea you can convert your BTC to cash right before buying it but that just goes right back to supporting FIAT.

I dumped at 7200 and bought at around 6000 and even though it worked out I am kicking myself hard because it showed just how weak my HODL is :(. If I do shit like that again it could end just as much the other way.

So so very true

5700!!! I also had dumped 20% at 7200 and moved it to BCH during the pump and I def dumped and bought those new BTC at 5700, I'm a happy camper indeed :)
