Terrible article.
"Nearly one in two participants strongly feels the development of cryptocurrency is heading in the right direction."
WTF - math, much? That means that most people do NOT think it's headed in the right direction.
"Moreover, 80% of survey participants know what Bitcoin is, or have used it in the past."
Wow. That's a pretty big spread. That's like, "Moreover, 80% of survey participants know what the Olympics is, or have been to events it in the past." Very, very, very different.

I was majorly in favour of ditching fossil fuels immediately (for years) until we had the "gas spike" where prices skyrocketed for several months and I got to see firsthand how poorly some families were correctly budgeting their energy costs despite having been using fossil fuels for many years. I also saw how Shell and BP were  committing individual price adjustments to the market for every single fill-up that I made.
I'm now convinced that fossil fuels are the way to go, and that, if global warming turns out to be a thing, we've always got solar and wind in our back pockets, so... smile! Be happy.

Wait a minute. Before we go all 'Murica, here, the market so far isn't dictating much at all. It seems like no one knows what Bitcoin wants to be. A payment channel we can all use? We need more transactions. A settlement layer to support an altcoin universe above it? So far, we don't see any of the cross-pollination you'd expect before seeing that happen. Will it be free, and freedom, and anti-tyranny? We're just getting started, and we've also got enough KYC/AML at the exchanges where, given enough time, the government, banks, and pretty much every powerful financial entity will know exactly what we're doing, to the minute. This is starting to get frustrating.

There are others, I believe. But, mainly, it's important to note that Bitcoin (and I own 37 BTC) isn't necessarily the best cryptocurrency. Period. There are others out there that are better. It is VERY possible that all the current Bitcoin fighting and controversy is creating an attention vacuum away from an alt coin that performs better and provides more capabilities, leaving Bitcoin to fall away when that happens. Also, if Bitcoin gets co-opted by the puppeteers behind Core's agenda (and yes, it is very defensible to phrase it that way, given the current evidence) and becomes a settlement layer with proprietary solutions on top of it, that might make the altcoins far more attractive. Think about it: Bitcoin had lots of the "There's a new technology in town" headlines, but, once the public tires of the endlessly repetitive Bitcoin news, a headline like, "There's a new cryptocurrency in town, and it's better" will flow freely, and people could potentially move into it. There aren't THAT many Bitcoin users where such a sudden switch would be impossible to imagine.

@_date: 2015-12-30 17:46:00
Then, with all due respect, it really shows ignorance of the altcoin "proto-crypto cloud" that currently orbits Bitcoin. Most people would be surprised to learn that there are MANY coins that don't have Bitcoin's market cap that actually deliver better anonymity and security, stronger encryption, and even a few that deliver a demonstrably stronger, better, faster and more technically advanced blockchain. Gridcoin, for instance, actually "does" something useful with its mining (scientific research).
Though it has the network effect going for it, Bitcoin is still relatively small in comparison to the fiat currencies it's competing against (though yes, still many times larger than its next competitor, but with the sizes as they are, things can change quickly). Besides the block size debate, I think 2016 could go in a number of decisive and believable directions, one of which would be to lose out against a better currency. Not joking. Bitcoin will become what it will become, but, in time, a different coin might emerge that takes the number of transactions we need to move to this currency. 
Expecting Bitcoin to do *everything* that digital currencies will be expected to do is unrealistic. A low-volume transaction layer can't be expected to do everything that a high-volume microtransaction currency is supposed to do.

*Control*. The things you just described remove the centralized authorities' ability to control you. As you know, there are hundreds of offenses, the bulk of which are not related to driving, where the State can restrict your driver's license, thus restricting your mobility. This is what they don't want. They want *their* capital to zoom freely around the world via free trade agreements, and to enable goods produced in impoverished countries by enslaved people back to sell in your market, where you are still restricted. They make the money off the margins and you still have very little economic mobility. The purpose of this is/should be to change this, to loosen the grip of these corrupt, centralized governments on restricting how you trade, where, and with whom. They want that power for themselves and their friends. They are not willing to play the game according to their own rules. That is what I think Bitcoiners are working to change.

I agree. This is literally many versus few. The open-source and decentralized nature of Bitcoin cannot be overcome in the long run. Look at how Android is surpassing iphone. However, it is very, very important that this group maintain vigilance towards the fact that "the other side" has a number of tiny advantages, namely, most of the world's governments, fiat currencies, central banks, standing armies, the global mainstream media, millions of intellectually zombified FOX NEWS viewers, and the ability to run false flag ops against Bitcoin via their intelligence services, resulting in the declaration of martial law while they transition to a global, centralized cryptocurrency of their own. Nothing much...
In other words, if any of you believe Bitcoin will never be banned or villainized, you're delusional. Develop this shit as securely, privately, make preparations to dev anonymously and secretly NOW, while you still can. 
In other words, an uphill battle.

You've never run a store. In fact, from your comments, I'm not sure you understand how stores even *work* beyond making a purchase, and heading home with whatever pack of Magic cards or action figurines. Stores (the ones you're talking about) aren't centralized at all. Even a chain store in the mall isn't centralized. What, do you think all their inventory is in the store? No, the stores around your city are all fed from a centralized warehouse that runs database report and ships inventory to the replenish the store's stocks from that warehouse. And no, that is NOT the kind of centralization you're referring to, here. 
Fun fact: Most stores on eBay "drop ship" to you, direct from the supplier in China. They just wait for you to order, then they place the order for you on the manufacturer's website. The online commerce world has been decentralizing for the past two decades. What OB will do is take  things the rest of the way by *also* decentralizing everything the REST of the way, from  the storefront (servers, UI, other logic, etc.) and payments. Which is significant. Which is significant. Which is special. Which is unique. Which is a game changer. That's why OB does. That's why there's no much (albeit rather quiet, considering Bitcoin) hype around OB.

Kinda. Not as decentralized as it could be (and retailers would LOVE to be able to throw all their ecommerce expenses out the window, and they're doing better, but, this will represent a whole new step, hence why it's sort of being compared to a protocol). So, yes. That's what decentralization does, of course. So, with OB, the content and the servers are stored elsewhere (not everywhere), with the blockchain sort of serving as a DNS for where all these assets are. Some of them will be on your own personal computer, for which you'll receive "dust", like, very small micropayments for when you serve them up. The customer's IT infrastructure (even if it's just a laptop and a home NAS) becomes part of the picture. That's why a lot of people are excited about OB. For a merchant (and I'm oversimplifying, here, but), it represents the promise of being able to serve the exact same "curated" brand experience (products, service, lifestyle, etc.), but without all the fraud and expensive, centralized servers and staff associated with that. Or, the staff and all that are paid for by everyone, collectively, via a decentralized infrastructure that's both everywhere and nowhere, maintained by everyone and no one. In other words....... it could be HUGE.  :)
The future will be weird. Imagine that the blockchain knows everything you own. It can run a profile of you and compare that profile to others which own similar things, then when it finds similar sites you'd shop at or whatever, if can us OB to have those sites and products and special offers literally waiting for you on your own computer, ready to make secure purchases.............. on and on and on......

It seems to me that 1MB is actually a good limit. And limits can actually work in our favour. Am I an idiot? (There, that'll get this reply started on the right foot.) I am not necessarily comfortable with Bitcoin growing and developing into doing things other than just being a currency. Maybe I'm a n00b, but, how much more information does a transaction need to have? Are we weaving V8 contracts into the blockchain, now?

It scares the hell out of me. Normally, I'd jump all over a fraidy-cat like me. I just bought a Ledger wallet. My plan is to put all but 1 BTC in cold storage and go paper wallet from there. I'm going to print two and put them both in safes in separate locations.

Is Bitcoin a currency that can free us from central bank manipulation? I am very ignorant about it, but, from what I can gather from the way it is tracked, it seems like it is still a very centralised currency. Any thoughts on this?

@_date: 2014-01-03 17:36:36
That works. Again, not meaning to split hairs with you in your AMA here, but in terms of how it's used, in terms of what it's describing, I prefer the **[Wikipedia definition]( that describes it as "money without intrinsic value." I also would argue when this term is used in online debate, here, most of the time it's used to refer to currency which has nothing backing it, i.e., paper which cannot be redeemed for something of equal value.

This comment is literally nothing short of fantasy, and the fact that it's still above zero only shows how little most of this sub truly appreciates what they're up against. *Law enforcement will see the value in not blacklisting coins??* You clearly don't even appreciate what's at stake, here. Control of the money supply is LITERALLY the source of global world power. The highest reaches of high finance "law enforcement" are corrupt beyond anything you can even imagine. It's why the FBI "declined" to prosecute HSBC for money laundering on "national security" grounds (it was the government's drug money). The USD is the world's reserve currency and is propped up by the military enforcing its use as the petrodollar. This is how the wars are funded, and they don't want that gravy train to stop just because a few nerds like a technology. Educate yourself, man. Or at least stop with the fantasizing.

It's not just "some miscellaneous country" somewhere.

Great discussion. Thank you.
Can you help me understand some assumptions I feel that you are making?


You know, or should know, what this is referring to. The adoption rates and transaction growth volumes have been known for quite some time. A past six month trend would very clearly indicate that an increase in capacity is needed. Whatever the block size will be next, IMHO it is an inexcusable falldown in governance and planning for Bitcoin to be where it is today.


This assumes that bad internet connections are the norm in the "second world" where you are clearly referring to. It is not. In fact, Internet speeds are significantly higher in many countries. I live in Canada, but in Kazakhstan, we find 20MB connections throughout much of the country. Kenya, Lebanon, Turkey, S. Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Panama, on and on, Internet connections are fast enough to pass 1mb blocks just fine. Pretending that bandwidth is significant at these blocks doesn't fly to anyone who's well-travelled and Internet-savvy.




I use the term AXA STRATEGIC VENTURES to describe why this is a major, major problem. 


This isn't church. You aren't explaining the Holy Trinity to me. The decentralization proof is in the pudding. So far, where would you spot the centralization in  the Bitcoin ecosystem?

Serious (and possibly ignorant, sorry) question, but if the hash power is going through the roof, why are we arguing so much about blocksize when the goal is throughput, decentralization and transaction volume??

Definitely stay out of the stock market. Did you see the movie "The Big Short?" For MONTHS after the crash should have started happening, the big investment banks were able to keep the prices high while they liquidated their positions, moving the losses to smaller, less powerful parties. Stay out of the market. It's rigged all to hell and back.
Bitcoin (I own 40, now) isn't going to perform without Internet, which will be shut down immediately when the crash happens (Internet kill switch). The key will be preparation, but not in the ways the "doomsday preppers" think. The key will be partnerships, knowing and having a good reputation with your neighbours, and a small stash of gasoline ready to go. You'll be camping outdoors for a while...

I'm not a teenager. I'm a former 20-year journalist who's almost 50 years old. I can take the facts. But so far, all I've got to show on the block size debate is pretty much summed up in this thread: a choice between "it will because it will!" and "it will because I said so!" and it will because "if 90% of you don't like our way, then 90% of you can leave."

SegWit is a brilliant optimization of how blocks are written. Perhaps you're confused as to what capacity means? If I have a pail and I can only put 100 marbles in it, have I increased capacity if I can now put 300 BB's in that same, exact size pail? SegWit is NOT a blocksize increase.

Have it. I'm quite content and happy to wait, as I feel I know what will happen (not to mention have a significant investment in it). Don't mind me.

To *not* be obtuse, the definition of the word *moderate* is quite clear. It is not removing quality, well-documented, well-reasoned comments which could sway the sub's subscribers--who are, by the way, the ones who are supposed to determine the "value" of particular comments. Otherwise, mods removing comments they disagree with means they are engaging in the c-word, right?

Forgive me, I keep seeing this said, but I never see it justified. There's been so much negativity over this debate that you could be forgiven for thinking that I'm just trolling you, but I swear I'm not. If you could, or if anyone can, could you EILI5 precisely *why*? Or link me to something? Because I've never seen anything that EXPLAINS this. It's supposed to be accepted by the Core crowd, but I've made the decision I've made based on other reasons.

I realize that there are a lot of idiots in Bitcoin. I am not one of them—but I'm also not stupid enough to assume things and not ask. NOT asking questions, even the stupid ones, is the best way to get your ass handed to you on the street. I understand the fundamentals to a point, and where Core breaks down is precisely in this space we're at, here, where questions from intelligent people (and who are invested in this space... I've bought 40 BTC since discovering Bitcoin in early 2014) are met with the equivalent of "*Pffft*, well, then educate yourself, ya worthless n00b." Odd that the Core that professes to be the stewards of decentralization and inclusion is so exclusive in their supporting arguments of same. 
And then 45 minutes later you check this thread on UNREDDIT and find that your comments have been shadowed, invisibly redacted. Brilliant.
Is THIS what I should be reading?
Or this...?
You're not talking to someone incapable of research. You're talking to someone who is, and, unlike the rest of the Internet, who, in his late fourties, knows that he either seeks contextual analysis from an expert if he's going to actually form some kind of *synthesis* on any of this. But how is he treated? Got anything other than "Let them eat cake?" Because the block size is about to double on you guys. And is that a good thing? 
You seem to be saying that increasing the block size isn't a panacea, and in fact, is a bad thing. Well, with $20k invested, I don't want to see Bitcoin fail (which Core seems to think those of us who're fed up with the censorship and other crap want, which is laughable, like we're some kind of haters). But if you're ***RIGHT*** (which is what I'm trying to determine), then I'm unwittingly supporting something that fucks Bitcoin, and *that* is what pisses me off. I want: decentralization, I want a tech that's anti-fragile and resistant to attempts to over-regulate or extinguish it. Is that what you want? Then tell me how small blocks (with the automagical LN network) do that. No joke, I've spent MONTHS reading about Bitcoin. Obviously, I'm not going to get any synthesis here. Your advice: Just read hours and hours of impassioned gobeldygook and trust us. It'll soon sink in that we're right! Right?
@_date: 2016-01-24 00:52:41
What I don't get is why the 10 minute limit isn't being challenged by anyone. Why is 10 minutes written in stone? The blocksize debate is a distraction from the debate about **transaction throughput.** Why aren't we talking about that??
@_date: 2016-03-06 18:29:01
OK, great. Then we're not far off on the technical side. I think Core's ideas (SegWit, even RBF if deployed responsibly) are brilliant, genius, even. But the fact is that the network blocks are full NOW. LN is not ready. SegWit will take time to achieve the benefits because of changes needed outside the Core code. No one denies this. So, why is Classic so hated? It's basically Core with 2MB blocks. If Core were to put out a 2MB block code right now, then code into the protocol something reasonable that lets blocks scale up, I'd run a Core node instead. But instead, it's a team of "Core" devs fighting to stay in charge. That's not how this was all supposed to work.
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:32:24
Gavin, thank you. Question: I run a full node, but I'm just a home user at home on broadband. I'm careful to keep it always running and it has 31 connections here, but, in your expert opinion, should I just not bother? The network is doing fine without me? I'm running a node in Canada, BTW. It seems to me that if I were in a less-developed area of the 'net where blocks would move more slowly, my running a node would truly help, but here in Canada, well, I guess I'm just doing it because I want it to stay legal and practical and I want to stay aware of and support the underlying network, not just sit there and hope my coins magically make me rich. What do you say?

OK. There are enough linguistic constructs here to help, plus enough technical terms here to help me Google some more, now. *Phew.* That's ALL I was wanting, and thank you. I run a rull node at home (not Core, not XT). The censorship is incompatible with my values. But if Core eventually deploys something that the banks hate, that's doesn't place Blockstream or any other entity in the middle of that system, then damned straight, you'll find me joining you. Thank you for engaging and donating your valuable time to help me understand a bit more.

There is absolutely no reason that a transaction cannot be processed.

Saying that "the limit is the limit because the limit is the limit" isn't a technical answer.

I would agree with much of this, however, analyzing the ecosystem from a "Bitcoin maximalist" seriously distorts your overall thinking, here. Bitcoin can indeed experience all the ways to die you outline here, but it won't have as much time as we think. The other coins are coming fast, and the "network effect" Bitcoin has only exists among the nerd community. Another coin can some along that doesn't have to be superior to win, like FedCoin,  which can win by regulations alone. We still have to disrupt to win, and that means moving way, way faster than this. Bitcoin doesn't have until 2022. I personally think we're in a state of emergency, but I'm done trying to ring that bell. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:45:18
Well, you call it political, but it's very, very tactical with the legitimate transaction problems affecting new users (who are guaranteed to be frustrated first time) and strategic, with the miners legitimately questioning whether their needs are going to be met long term. SegWit won't activate without a hard fork, and 2mb isn't enough. Fork Bitcoin. The small blockers can ETC themselves to their heart's desire.

Wow, this is quite an eerie message for me to read. I literally just did *exactly* what you did here this week--backed up everything with titanium backup, wiped phone,  reinstalled CyanogenMod 12.1, and then, like you, found that titanium backup hadn't restored my Mycelium wallet. The difference here is that I started to restore my wallet from its seed but tried a separate restore of just the wallet app and it worked, so I didn't need to proceed. 
I suspect that you have a malicious app on your phone. Was root enabled at the time? Root, by default, is not enabled in the developer options when you first reinstall CyanogenMod. I don't know, however, if that would have much of an effect on this. This is quite a mystery.

Agree. Thank you for noting this. I'm going to look into how to encrypt the SD card, though, if this is happening from a malicious app, that won't help. 
I would have expected Ti backup, a granddaddy and one of the most expensive apps in the Play Store to provide better security than that. I'll look into whether backups can be encrypted/PW protected (which I assume would have helped, though, we're not getting any closer, here, as a malicious app would have had 2FA access on a rooted phone (assuming, of course, that that app was given root access)).

Anyone that thought that BTC was going to magically take over the world during the Mt. Gox debacle had no idea what was going on. For BTC to really fly it'll take usage/adoption, and we're not there yet. I'm long on BTC and bought some more near the floor last night.

This is really bothering me. Honestly, do you have anti-virus installed? I use Kaspersky for Android. Did you have your Ti backups shared with the cloud, like Dropbox, at all? Maybe your backups were stolen via your PC, which seems like a more common vector? Also, could it be possible at all that your seed was stolen by a friend, or someone?? This seems so ridiculous.

OK (upvote), but, how is the price slide anyone's fault? Yes, we've had some uncertainty, but that's nothing in comparison to the uncertainty that would be caused to the ecosystem if the Bitcoin devs *not* reached consensus. I think outside observers would see that Bitcoin is healthy once ANY BIPXXX proposal is finally adopted. To me, if the consensus mechanism passes this real world test, then, no matter which BIP proposal is adopted, Bitcoin itself has passed a huge milestone with this controversey.

Interesting presentation. Some questions, if anyone wants to take a crack at them. What is meant by:




Re: Fees


current digital currency systems
– There will be a fixed eventual supply, so
the subsidy is not permanent
– There is an incentive problem …
Slide 19 totally gets the "supercomputer" comparison wrong. The Bitcoin network, for instance, has no floating-point calculation capabilities (as I understand it) so, not really comparable to a super computer.
I just found this interesting, wondering what is meant here:




could be decided by a few people
What is meant by "Multi-asset payment systems"?
– Chance to influence reshaping of financial system through technology (Wolf)
– Potential new levers from central bank issued digital currency, elimination of
the zero lower bound (Kimball, Rogoff)
Any comments appreciated.

- What are you talking about, *fiat*? Money is tangible. I can get it from an ATM. 
- Bullshit. It's not more convenient than using my AMEX. And I get air plan miles. Does Bitcoin have air miles? I didn't think so.
- I don't care if it's more convenient for the retailer. Compete or die.
- I'm not going to buy into something that fluctuates. Even if it goes up. I always know what my money can buy.
- Bitcoin isn't backed by anything.
- You can't buy anything tangible. (I show him $3,000,000 condos in Costa Rica being offered for Bitcoin). "Those are just idiot nerds looking to sell to other idiot nerds."
...and so on. The conversation basically boiled down to "No, not interested, for [whatever] reason," and the reasons became more and more specious as the doors closed...

This was my thread. I *asked* about Bitcoin in the title, but only if they were buying it. You'll notice I didn't mention or pump Bitcoin anywhere else as, frankly, most of the outside world is so beholden and so invested, and it's pretty much all Buttcoin to me. I was more interested in determining their levels of awareness of their situation, how they got there, what they want, all that stuff. I also made a similar post in as well ([here](
)), but went no more into Bitcoin than that question alone. I felt it was a relevant question.
I also made **[this]( for them, too. They're going through a lot right now and I wanted to give them some encouragement. 
The thing I came away with from those threads is wonder and amazement that the Italians believe they can handle this.

I want to agree with you, I would love to tomorrow wake up in this world you're describing, but, I think it's way, way too early. We haven't seen their endgame, yet. For instance, as Andreas said in a recent talk, "I'm afraid that there will be a terrorist event, and, since the terrorists used Bitcoin to pay for their taxi on the way there, bang—BITCOIN SUPPORTS TERRORISM." If the powers that be cannot control the tech, fine, but they can certainly halt or slow adoption towards centralized coins by making the phrase "Do you accept Bitcoin?" mean the same thing as, "Want to blow shit up and kill innocent 'Muricans?"
Myself, and I am dead serious saying this, I am not going to buy any more Bitcoins until after we've seen how their false flag shapes up. Because there will be one.

Crash &lt; slow decline
Read the book, "The Long Emergency." This is a crash, but it'll be a slow one, much like, say, if the world's largest cruise ship ran aground off a deserted island. It'll take hours and maybe days to get everyone off. Some will drown, etc. Eventually the ship will sink. The people that can swim to shore will have to survive. It'll be like that. Not some "deploy airbags" hard stop. Economies don't work like that.

They won't have to *enforce* it. They'll just have to ensure that the market for BTC remains suppressed while reducing friction towards centralized coins. If it is unable to serve as a store of value, it is therefore unable to serve as a store of value.

I see the constraints. I agree that the money would have, er, significantly less motivation to move, hence it would be like sequestering the money, which I think obviously is a disincentive that would have to be balanced with the incentives to spend. Essentially, I think I'm asking what would create "organic, free-range, cruelty-free" money? If that's not a stupid *analogy*, but, still, I think it's an appropriate one.

This. The buttcoiners are engaging in the very thing they accuse us of, simply by saying, "That can't be true!" or even the much more predatory, "We believe in the dominant system, and won't hesitate to take/support actions which will destroy you," that is, they have seen (or even participated in), time and time again, economies, governments, social movements and ideals, all get quashed by the very System they support. In their minds, it is therefore very logical that "it will happen again to you, too, Bitcoin." They know that it would happen to them as well if they deviate from the System, therefore, they better throw the might of their very intelligent minds into the cognitive dissonance required to support that system at any cost, even until its bitter end.

I'm told that corruption in Greece was literally a way of LIFE for them. No one paying their taxes, shady deals, and a very healthy underground bargaining economy. Greece should never have been in the EU to begin with, and we all know that. We also all know that Goldman Sachs restructured and hid their debt from view, colluding with the auditors to mask their debt. Plus, Brussels (*coincidentally* the home of NATO) wanted them in the EU very badly, so they banked on being able to handle it. 
I beleive from reading that thread (which was very educational for me) that the outcome for the EU has literally no dependencies whatsoever on tomorrow's vote. It's fucked either way.

This is of course true. Please don't dismiss this idea out of hand, however. Basically, I'm asking "How can Bitcoin align groups of like-minded spenders?" I'm trying to envision a scenario where the rules are inclusive enough where no one would mind, but would result in large (and mostly unaware of these moral rules on a day-top-day basis) and loosely-knit group of people who change the world simply by spending in similar ways. At the largest levels, the central banks of the fiat world enforce the fiat morality—that is, scarcity and war. How could Bitcoin be engineered (if at all) to allow a large, numerous group to be as powerful as a central bank?

This is a good point, but, as we've seen with fiat money not being sent to EU Bitcoin exchanges, etc., obviously, there are areas at the edges of fiat money where the fungibility need not be absolute.

SegWit is not a blocksize increase. It compresses more transactions into a block, yes, and it's an elegant and beautiful solution. But it is not a blocksize increase. And it is not governance on that increase, either. Once SegWit has been deployed, it will not be able to bring these efficiencies again.

Personally, I commend for spotting this, and, whichever client someone runs, they hopefully we'll see if an update, shortly. And let's move on. 
All this said, however, is the ASIC Improvement really an *exploit*? That's what it seems like to me. It seems like an improvement. Yes, JiHan wanted to preserve all advantages and getting those ASICs to market (or is he not selling the chips to competitors?). Doesn't this happen with other, silicon-based innovations? It's a bit early to call this something nefarious on his part. Who can blame him? This is a system of incentives. Period. Let's not act surprised.

This is an advantage, however. It's not sucking bandwidth or capacity. It just is designed to give Bitmain faster ASICs. I fail to see how this is a threat to Bitcoin. As I see it, this is Jihan competing against his fellow miners, and patenting his "innovation" in that regard. Didn't Intel do this with their controversial MMC architecture?

Not true. Much of what he writes is hard for those in power to hear. His editorials on Greece, for instance, are bang on. But so many economists think that the way things work currently work that way because "that's just how things naturally developed," it's clear that Krugman thinks the system we have "evolved," when in fact it was built around tyranny from the beginning. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:26:00
The crux of the matter isn't whether Krugman is wrong here, it's whether or not he truly believes what he is saying. He does. In that sense, he is doing Bitcoin a huge favor by showing everyone just how  misguided and delusional the bankers really are. Is it our job to correct him? Hardly—the longer they sleep and the longer they let Bitcoin  develop into the disruptor that it will be, the less power they will have to stop it. 
Bitcoin is a structural play that decentralizes trust itself. It eliminates the middleman on a global scale. In that sense, the obviousness of its advantages are *inherent* in its structure. Don't rail against their illusions of control. Just sit back and let the bankers sleep on the train tracks while this Bitcoin train gathers speed...

This. Like, myself, I am a complete idiot. And I have backed up my keys off my phone. With all due respect to OP, who's learning a lesson, there's really no excuse for someone not to have their keys backed up. In fact, I would say that I'm safer than someone really tech-savvy here because whenever I'm in one of my tech-savvy strength areas, I tend to take chances. But when I was messing with my Bitcoin and setting everything up, holy shit, I was sweating like I was Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible. My keys are backed up in several places, here.

The conversion from fiat to Bitcoin happens ONCE. This is not a currency play, or an exchange play of any kind. No one's making money off the MARKET, dipshit, they're making money off the SAVINGS IN TRANSACTION COSTS. DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS BASICALLY THE BIGGEST SELLING POINT FOR THIS CURRENCY? The point is that they don't have to pay a middleman all the time. 
This is Africa.
So instead of YOUR system, which is:
- Fiat
- Inflation
- Corruption
- **High disincentives due to high transaction costs**
We have:
- Fiat
- Bitcoin
- No middlemen
- **Low disincentives due to low transaction costs**
- More transactions, more economic activity, and more **value** concentrated in the hands of the Bitcoin user.
Wow. How did this get to be for you?

I appreciate this reply. OK, let's, then. The repression inherent in the system isn't due to its workflow or structure. It's due to three main things, all of which are being discussed in some way here: 1) its centralized hierarchy, 2) its lack of transparency in decisionmaking by that hierarchy, 3) the constant expansion of the money supply, and 4) the illusion that economic power is political, when in fact it is *systemic*, that is, the central bankers can, at will, very easily overpower and secretly manipulate both individual economies and the global economy at large while people believe that those decisions and policies are being made by their political leaders.

This is a really awesome idea, and I really hope that this kind of thing takes off. I would add that I think it's important to factor in the total value of things a seller has sold, for instance, on eBay, you see sellers pumping up feedback for accounts by selling small, cheap things, then suddenly they turn negative scamming people on high dollar, high value things, so I would only add to your idea that something should factor in the total value of the items sold by a seller in calculating the reputational score. If a website like Swappa did this, I would feel much more comfortable that I am NOT going in dry.

I think this is *wildly* undercutting the potential of Bitcoin. I'm not saying it'll be $300k per coin, who knows that stuff. Basically, Bitcoin is like standing in a parking lot in a thunderstorm—holding up a golf club. It's playing the *electricity*, in a very real way. I'm not an economist, but, going from a debt-based money to a hard money like Bitcoin means that, as the transition happens, there comes a time when the velocity of fiat money falls sufficiently that, to preserve the currency's purchasing power, it absolutely *has* to transition over to BTC (or whatever is dominant, and offers the same velocity). For instance, we have to remember here that the world's central banks have ledgers with *trillions* of unspent currency, money that, once rampant, runaway inflation happens, it'll HAVE to seek a safe store of value if it's going to save itself. You know? In other words, this "study" makes some key assumptions, most notably that the USD will continue to function until that time. It won't. Even people that have never heard of Bitcoin know this.
Can anyone help me think this through? I honestly don't think we're properly visualizing what would happen with respect to fiat currencies if Bitcoin is mass-adopted.
@_date: 2015-04-11 04:52:39


At the stage you describe, $3.5B is a snap of their fingers. It's chump change. The competition isn't the other  currency or infrastructure plays; it's the process itself and whether it will come down to a fight between centralization and government/fiat control vs. decentralization and a truly free, do-anything currency.
How? Assume that the Powers I'm referring to can engineer any event whatsoever. They can plant any story in any major news outlet and not just one-off articles; they can engage that story from below and  develop it into any narrative they want, meaning that they can villainize and demonize any actor, any event, and any technology via pre-planned narratives with pre-positioned provocateurs and enablers. We already know this is a *fact*. 
Then suddenly:
    ON CNN TONIGHT: WHEN 'CRYPTO-CURRENCIES' GO MAINSTREAM, PEOPLE DIE!
    It won't just kill your kids—you'll lose everything you own, too!
It's a fact that the FBI has targeted people around the country (many who are mentally ill or otherwise deemed susceptible) and provided the weapons and the means to instigate terror plots. When that "terror" money suddenly comes from Afpakiranistan via Bitcoin—oh noes, *they* blew up the Statue of Liberty! And they were funded by teh Bitcoins!—do you doubt for a second that the media will be ready with a "we need a centralized ledger—for your safety!" narrative ready to go?
Then, in comes Ripple to save the day.
Before anyone calls me a loon, here, this sort of thing is *happening* all over the place, all the time. And I firmly believe it's happening now (**[Look]( at the very last few pages of this PDF on the St. Louis Federal Reserve website. Now look at the last page. See anything funny?)

Are you being serious? They'll buy Bitcoin like everyone else does: ONCE, WITH FIAT CURRENCY, THEN SPEND IT (AND RECEIVE IT, TOO!) JUST LIKE WE DO. Did you know that the people on the other side of the world are not standing upside down?
What's the difference between that and the fiat they're spending now? Nothing. They use fiat now, it circulates, great—but the middlemen take a huge cut off every transaction due to the way the System hobbles their economic activities. Holy fuck, I'm explaining this to you? Once the Bitcoins (however they're acquired) are in their phones and wallets, that Systemic tax on their economic activity is removed. What don't you get about that?
TL;DR : We are not arguing about HOW they get the Bitcoin. We are talking about the System and how Bitcoin removes the inherent bias and penalties against the poor from that System. Also, 1+1 =2.

How will you prevent funding terrorism?* These are some of the main questions that will drive the future of cryptocurrencies, and they're also the questions I see addressed least here in this sub. It does this community no good whatsoever to pretend that magical unicorn infrastructure will automagically "free market" us out of these sticky, foundational adoption issues. And, inb4 the "It's not our job to do that" folks, well, we should be siezing the opportunity to address and facilitate those answers, at least at a basic, foundational level, because, like it or not, those questions represent a HUGE fork in the road in Bitcoin's development. IMHO, we HAVE to develop some kind of *political* identity at some point.

Epic ignorance. The USD is not controlled by the US government. That, first off, is a problem. Second, it's a debt-based currency, which means that *someone* has to be underwater, big time, somewhere, for the System to work. And so on. I could go on, but, it's clear you haven't strayed far from what you *think* you were taught in school, where the economic dogma is enforced. What's my job, here?

Urm, *okaaaay,* let's run with this. People reading your comment should know this: The banks are playing buzzword bingo. Blockchain? A blockchain is actually a very inefficient database strategy. It only exists because this is the best way so far found to enable trust-less entries. But the banks don't want to enable *that* (too messy!) so... they'll just go with something from Oracle or IBM and be done with it.
No. No financial institutions are buying blockchain. It's Bitcoin or bust, literally.

That's great and all, but how the USD performs for its users is of little interest to the people that run the central banks. They know that crashing all that QE printed currency into their economy will crash same economy, so they are working on a scheme to keep their spoils and move us to a new, global currency foundation. They don't care how the USD is performing on any other metric other than what is sustainably and forever in their pockets.

LOL. No, this is fact.  In the period you're referencing there were 1) fewer exchanges and 2) less transparency and 3) less attention from the authorities towards their behaviour. Bots trading to other bots, no fundamentals whatsoever. This is different. This isn't being driven by one exchange, one country, or one speculative bubble. Anyone that's been paying attention to Bitcoin knows this is fact.
I'm 47 and this isn't my first rodeo. ***This*** is the part of any tech that I enjoy the most, and I've lived through it back when Mosaic became Netscape, Intuit shot to the moon, and Yahoo went to town on all your doubting asses. I've been on the up ramp on every bubble since 1999, and those of us that know Bitcoin know what we see here. Move along. The shills and FUD masters don't hold sway over us and our tech anymore. Fuck the moon, I don't care if I'm a millionaire someday. But I know a good tech when I see one (and I dropped $10k at $320 CAD eight months ago to back that up). I'm up 30% on this "speculation," except this isn't spec at all. This is HAPPENING.

Wait. Who's saying we should *convert*? No, we need to add it to the box of tools we use to transact. Cash and credit are still way easier right now than using bitcoin. In fact, I only own 3BTC and have never spent one bit of any of it, yet, but that's not the point. The main advantage where Bitcoin shines is how easy it is in certain transactions where the middleman takes too much of a cut or makes that transaction just impossible. ADD Bitcoin to how you transact. But no one is being told to convert wholesale to this new currency.

I'm new to Bitcoin, but IMHO, this comment is basically what I think the next four years of Bitcoin will look like.  This is where the friction is about to start. I feel like the government is watching to see whether they can leverage Bitcoin to get rid of the "so difficult to tax" nature of cash transactions (I know people, for instance, who run their businesses as cash only and even though they make half of what I make, they don't pay tax, so). I basically want a disposable, never-traceable to me currency system. I do intend to pay taxes, of course, as I believe we get lots for our taxes (I'm not American) but, all I'm saying is that I want my "me and the government" relationship to be a mutual one where I have the same levels of control they do.

Good points, absolutely, but what if the blockchain is held in a neutral third party, like, oh, say, ***RIPPLE*** (and managed, let's say, by a "politically independent" entity), oh, hey, it's private blockchain!
We must remember that the winners and losers in the cryptocurrency space have already been ordained by the powers that be. For instance, look at the last couple pages from **[this presentation]( from the St. Louis Federal Reserve's "Dialogue with the Fed" for instance (**[screenshot]( R3/Ripple has been ordained as the winner from the beginning.

Irrelevant question. NOT trying to be a Reddit jerk, tho, with that. I say that because the fundamentals are different. The run to $1200 was literal corruption at the Mt.

Let's get one thing straight: *The Economist* is owned by the Rothschilds. Back when I was in college and studing economics, our teacher insisted that each student get a subscription to this magazine for the two semesters we were in his class. This magazine is actually one of the reasons I went into journalism, too. The idea that I could potentially write and inform people like this? And he was right, too; this magazine tells it like it is, and if you read this, you *are definitely* informed on global economics, but, over time, I've realized that that's because they're telling you themselves what they're doing. *The Economist* is more of a globalist diary than an actual magazine where any 'reporting' is going on. They're well informed because they are also the ones doing everything. They're not digging things up or doing investigative journalism. They're just reporting what their bosses are *doing*.

Right. Got it. My rant is "conspiratorial," but having 90% of your income in Bitcoin makes toooootal sense to everyone here. 
Alex Jones is a loon of a person. What I have said here is factually accurate and can be backed up. Yes, the Elite meet yearly at the Bilderberg conference. You're right. I should back off the conspiracies. I'm sure everything is above board and they simply show off their cars, discuss wines, and just generally have a fun sleepover. Meanwhile, sorry—did I miss something? Because, from the way it's used, "fiat" isn't just a codeword in We know what it means. It means empty pieces of paper, backed by nothing but guns. This sub knows what it means. But this sub—and anyone with 90% of their income in Bitcoin—is fucking HIGH if they think they're not going to SWAT team break down your door looking for your QR codes and hardware wallets.

I feel that this will actually be a super crucial, critical thing—soon. What do we think, that everything is just going to stay the course while digital currencies take over? That the banksters will just roll over and not fight? THAT is actually the real reason why *I'm* in Bitcoin. Look: we all know that the world's assets have been bought with their fiat funny money. As their grip on the monetary system decentralizes, you think they're not going to brand Bitcoiners as terrorists?? We're gearing up for the fight of our lives, here. We have to get the foundations right so that these currencies can flow while minimizing the possibility that they'll be hacked, tracked, or stopped.
You watch. Over the next couple years there will be false fags and Bitcoin will be painted as the chief funding tool of ISIS. I am not kidding around saying that.

They have no choice. LOL, if you don't think this kind of "stomp Bitcoin, insert Fedcoin" bullshit isn't coming here, too, you're high. The central bankers are legit terrorists and very, very experienced warmongers with many, many weapons in their pocket (PR, banks, legislation, psyops, false flags, etc.) and I would bet my stones that they've got very refined and very well thought out plans locked and loaded for when they're ready for the full court press. You don't think Ripple will be the paddock we'll all be herded into? They're just biding their time and tolerating Bitcoin (so as not to taint the concept of cryptocurrencies overall) until their solution is ready. Then their push will begin.
The winners and losers in the cryptocurrency space have already been ordained by the powers that be. For instance, look at the last couple pages from **[this presentation]( from the St. Louis Federal Reserve's "Dialogue with the Fed" for instance (**[screenshot]( R3/Ripple has been ordained as the winner from the beginning. I personally think it's time to discuss the legacy political powers that directly and negatively impact the cryptocurrency space. YES it's just a database. But this is their plan.

That money is already printed and on the ledgers of the central banks.

This reply is wise, except that it considers Bitcoin as a currency *only*, and your advice lumps Bitcoin into traditional currency trading dogma (and, in using that word, I am not trying to imply that you're wrong in your advice), so therefore does not fit into traditional "sound financial planning" advice. 
In the context of OP's post, Bitcoin is useful for its additional functions. It is:
- bankless, which is good because, as we saw in Greece, the banks in a crisis will either be too insolvent to serve their customers or prevented from doing so by law
- not a national currency, therefore, not tied to the health of one particular country
- decentralized, meaning that it can be owned and traded/spent digitally, making it very difficult to

Bitcoin's architecture and permissionless structure is antithetical to their power, however. They are about to learn this. 
Think this through: So they own some Bitcoin, but, *then* what? Deploy it as designed? This kills their business model.
I realize they may have more complex plans than this, but, my point is that this is not being driven by the banks alone. People are realizing 1) the level of problems in the current system and 2) the capabilities of Bitcoin. It's like a huge balloon that has been holding pressure with nowhere to go, but now it has this outlet.

- Propaganda for whatever wars are happening (see their recent coverage on Syria, which is 100% against Russia, very predictable), also against Iran, basically 100% alignment with zionist banking interests
- Never question the central banking model
- Report on central banking policymaking as gospel
- Attribute all economic positives to said model, and any and all international problems as being caused by either a country's inability/unwillingness to fall into line with that model as bad leadership, bad governance, etc.
- Attribute any and all humanity-scale evolution/improvements to central banking

People that even believe that the gold is there are crazy. And even if they own physical gold, exactly what good is it? The key to the future is that we need to have something that we can *trade*. That's Bitcoin. Please don't get me wrong, I totally, 100% agree with you that Bitcoin is the solution.

This is excellent logic, except, most of these currencies, too, are not attractive to the educated Chinese currency trader, and in some cases come with further local stipulations that make spending/utilizing these new currencies for them locally. If I traded $50k of CNY for EUR, if I'm Chinese, what then? What practical good is that transaction? Meanwhile, they can clearly see that BTC is appreciating, and as you point out, they can spend BTC locally without much fear, as China loves Bitcoin and seems to be leading the way in user adoption.

It shouldn't be about camps and "us vs. them." It's about constituents. Big blocks actually serve Bitcoin better, because it offers more reward to the miners in exchange for securing the network.

There is no way in hell that the blockchain will scale up to all the coffees—and you guys are right, I mean, do we need them recorded for all time, anyway? Sidechains will do that.

Every VP, every director, EVERYONE. We'd been bought. The troops were herded into a large room and a man in a tailored suit gave us a nice "welcome to the new family" speech. 
Then the truth was given to us by our editors and direct supervisors, that is, the truth that THEY were told. No more stories about any of the industries in our employer's holdings. No more this. No more that. I've seen it.

@_date: 2016-07-01 03:03:57
Wow. OK, conversation closed, then. If you're as simpleminded as to think that a project will command any majority of hashpower before it is selected, well, you're dumber than I first took you for.
These projects are *thriving* simply by virtue of being legitimate threats to Core's stranglehold on what the miner's run. The very fact that they exist as **viable** alternatives is precisely what means that they are thriving (as in, active clients with dedicated, involved communities that are indeed pumping out versions intended to compete with Core). In fact, features in several of these other clients are (XThin blocks, for instance) are currently migrating over to Core in discussions they are having. 
The whole POINT of having these clients "ready to go" if conditions warrant (say, oh, if Core starts butt-fucking the miners, let's say) is what makes them viable.
RES tagging you, er, rather differently. Off you go.

Um... why is this post even
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:07:32


And... you lost me. And anyone with a brain reading this. 
The Core team knows Bitcoin, but others do, as well. If this weren't true, Classic, XT, and BU wouldn't exist—and they are thriving. The Core team also knows nothing of economics, UX, or audience adoption strategies, and, you seem to *conveniently* ignore the fact that their employer's main investor means that the project is *seriously* compromised. Ignoring this only shows the cognitive dissonance in your arguments.
History is replete with examples of technology drained and depleted by cults of personality. Supporting or proposing a scheme whereby  an open source project can fluorish with a closed source development team is wrong, foolish, and ignorantly disregards this fact will doom this project. 


And... here we are. Not someday... NOW.

You have 10,000 BTC??
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:46:48
Cool. Upvote. Thanks, Greg. Clearly, if the BTC log doesn't include automod info, then you are correct in pointing out that this wouldn't be complete.
I don't give a shit about trying to humiliate It's just that I refuse to live in a sub where "blaming the auto-mod dog for your own farts" is a *thing.*
And, you might want to screencap the occasional anomaly when you see it—I **prmise** you, I'll go after or anyone else just as hard as I do you if there's confirmed shenanigans.
Now, when's implementing the same thing for Or is that kind of transparency toxic to your Blockstream contract incentives?

Total load of faggots.
A summary of the SlashTube comments:
"Fuck Bitcoin. I bought an old S3 and tried to mine, total loser game for LOOOOSERS." Yeah, faggot. Don't learn about the *difficulty* or anything. Don't bother understanding Bitcoin... Just buy an obsolete miner and expect "teh free munny" to rain down on you from the sky. Fucking fucktards.
Onwards. We have a financial revolution to deliver. And a bunch of ferret-owning SlashDot faggots aren't going to hold us back.

From whose perspective? The exchanges, or the users? Two different things.

Guaranteed you are under 25 years old. I'm 50. Anyone here remember the Intel MMC controversy? At the time, Windows had multimedia improvements. Intel improved it by integrating it into their chips. Fight ensued. Some called it Intel trying to "usurp Windows" (Guess who the fucktards were, by the way?).
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:38:55
Erase the last sentence. Definitely not needed. 
You're wrong, and the solution evolution came up with is actually pretty interesting, but, why Google when you can just drive-by the reply button and move on? Go with your gut, man. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 13:40:33
You still haven't explained the activity that got these accounts frozen. From the past 100-50,000 posts (I'm being a little sarcastic, maybe, but), it's not just "purchasing Bitcoin."

Does the link include the automoderator actions? GMax claims those are a major way rBTC moderates opposing views (above).

I have many thousands of GNT, but I can't get them out of the Jacks wallet because it will not send more than 999 right now.

Their investors, however... *nosomuch.*
Forgive me—and I seriously don't mean this as a genuine insult—but, are you in your teens? Do you have a resume that can fit on a Post-it^TM note?? Because, I'm almost 50, and I know *exactly* what an investor like AXA wants out of Blockstream and Core's developers. 
And we'll see, soon enough. Later. MUCH later.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:50:01
No. This is 100% wrong. Bitcoin's existence in a decade from now is far from guaranteed. Just simply there being a coin that "is Bitcoin" doesn't guarantee SoV. ETC, for instance, has a fixed supply. Bitcoin is in a LOT of trouble. It's a governance nightmare and no one gives a shit about the neckbeard maximalists anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:15:40
Where neckbeard economics flails, however, is understanding that network fees requires for using Bitcoin eventually become so high that they are no longer incentives within the system. People will use something else instead.

is pretty insistent that apologies are due his way when he feels slandered, but things go pretty silent on his end when the tables are turned—and confirmed true. 
Search the automod logs, Greg, if you can break yourself away from ETC.
@_date: 2016-07-30 16:22:59
Also be aware of the alts. Bitcoin isn't the only game in town. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:00:17
Yay, you got your oar in the water. Now take it back to the tiny fishbowl where it belongs. 
Bitcoin started as a libertarian freedom coin. Now it's full of cunts and bankers, the very same asshats it was supposed to turn upside down. A kind of William Golden's "Lord of the Files" meets George Orwell's "Animal Mine". 
 Now, go back to lurking if you have that little to say. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 03:59:25
PS. Still waiting on your definition of what constitutes a "spam" transaction.
And LOL, you don't think something is "thriving" until it has hashpower, and yet, you're "happy" to have "options" coming about. That's pure genius, right there. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:39:23
Quite the assumption. I own plenty of BTC (in the solid six figures), thanks. Anyone "all in" on any crypto is merely asking for trouble. That said, however, my portfolio would not be anywhere near where it is today had I not recognized exactly what's going on and made the subsequent investment choices that I did. 
Put in my two weeks notice *today*, FWIW. Assume whatever 
@_date: 2016-07-10 20:51:02
Is that logical, tho? Seriously, if they didn't have a significant (to them) amount of BTC on hese exchanges, we wouldn't be seeing all these posts. The only reason to buy Bitcoin on Coinbase or Circle is because you intend to use their other services. Otherwise, buy on Polo, BitFinex or Kraken, then move as normal. Or even buy locally. I wouldn't touch those others with a 10 foot pole.

All evidence points to Core being compromised by the very same interests it is pretending to disintermediate. I have shared links with you with *proof* of said compromise, and yet you still steadfastly support Core.
