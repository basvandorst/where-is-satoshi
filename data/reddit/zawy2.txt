If Satoshi has the private key, it can be spent. Only the 50 BTC reward knowably can't be spent by him.  The other 19 BTC that have been sent there might be.  See "block reward" section here:

In 10 years $1850 will barely be paying your expenses for a month.  In 5 years, those 3 bitcoins will be worth $150,000 if bitcoins continue to increase at less than 1/2 the curve-fitted trend of the last 4 years, allowing you to pay cash for a median size HOUSE in many parts of the country, especially if interest rates go up.  I would not plan on bitcoins being worth more than this $50,000 each, but I would not place any bet against it, either.  Selling bitcoins now is a bet against bitcoin reaching even $1,000, which sounds like a very unwise bet.  Selling at $10,000 each in as little as 2 years seems reasonable.  Risky bets should be made when you're young and do not have that much to lose.  $2,000 is NOTHING.

Your first graph in this video is wrong.  The highest count for solvetimes is determined by PDF and is 10 minutes PDF = t/10*e^(-t/10).  
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:40:35
Your chart has a peak at about 1 minute. I believe a PDF is the same as a "continuous histogram" (and hence you "count" y-axis). 
 The peak of that graph and the PDF equation I gave should be 10 minutes.  The median is skewed low (ln(2) = 0.69 of 10 minutes) so that you could pick a wider bin for the histogram to make a peak below 10, but it won't be shifted so far down as in your graph.  You present the counts again in graphs for different values of k that gives the right impression, which is that the skewed nature tends to shift closer to our desired solvetime, but the peak of the PDFs are always at 10 which is different from your charts.  I've done histograms on coins to check that they follow the PDF.   
Are there discussions of your work anywhere?  How serious is BCH cnosidering it?  Do you have a response to these critical comments:

Satoshi's writing indicates he's smarter than Szabo. Szabo's full of facts, never making a point.  Satoshi was always strictly business-at-hand and a lot kinder than what I see in Szabo.   His extremely even-keeled mannerisms are what give me the impression of him being really smart

OK, thanks for correcting me.  I thought I had confirmed it, but now I see your chart is correct.  
I was trying to apply wiki's PMF directly when it needs integrating:
PMF = a^k * e^-a / k!
For our poisson, k=1.   a = expected occurrences in an interval, which is a fraction or multiple of our target solvetime. For us, a=t/T where t=solvetime and T=10 minutes.   Integrating it = cumulative function. So if I integrate it over each small bin, I get your values.

There's a profound irony in bitcoin enthusiasts arguing against the legitimacy of patents.  If you want a level playing field in society, then at least your currency should not benefit people for simply being the first to have THE IDEA of getting involved it.  Patents, at least, expire, and there are plenty of ways to cheat around them.
Each coin you hold is intellectual property that you hope will shift a larger percentage of society's wealth from others to yourself without working for it as the coin's demand/supply ratio increases.
A fixed-quantity or deflating currency has always been the dream and foundation of entrenched powers who want to stay entrenched without having to work. Every successful economic system since Persian times has had extensive debt erasure if not all-out jubilee's (Jewish cyclic society-wide debt erasure) as a key to leveling the playing field ( see  ). 
Printing money is a type of debt erasure. Our current problem is not excess money printing as much as it is printing mainly to enrich the rich by getting the toxic "assets" off banks balance sheets and onto taxpayers, among many other things, like social security to already wealthy grandparents (welfare for the rich).
Patents expire for the same reason debt erasure is important. Society can grow stronger in the future if the wealthy holders of patents, land, money, etc are kept on their toes by not being allowed to retain their wealth forever and for their heirs (land has really high taxes if you are not going to gainfully employ it for 2 generations).
I read a few things by Brian Armstrong and seen his work and philosophy.  "Open source" haters could aspire to be as constructive by working more within the bounds of reason, reality, and even personal profit instead of simply hating everyone else working in an economic system.  He's giving away  $50 for everyone who gets a friend to spend $100 on bitcoin through coinbase.  You guys are not promoting bitcoin fast enough, so he's paying people out the wazoo to get people involved. Bitcoin programmers were not able to make it fast, easy, and secure for common people, so he's doing it.  Who's been able to get their parents to wire transfer the proceeds to Ukraine?  Who was able to, but they sent it to Japan instead?

I just started learning more about USAF today and started reading Shaolinfry's post on reddit. About 1/3 of the way through it I recognized a personality very similar to Satoshi.  I thought maybe someone else had noticed it and I did a search, and came across the two people in this thread. Note that my reason is different from theirs. I  thought about it based on personality and they suspected it based on his skill and strict methods that maintain anonymity.  The personality I seem to recognize is based on Satoshi being an incredibly "smooth operator" in personality, social skill, and work. His words are flawlessly cooperative, constructive, and on topic. Even his dislike and work against "the machine" seem to be his primary goal, but there is no vitriol in their words or methods.  I have only met one other person in forums that was smoother than Satoshi, and his net worth is similarly above $10 million (he did it by forming health care businesses instead of investing in cryptocoins). I have an admiration for Nick Szabo, but he is a completely different character.  Wei Dai is smooth but still not on Satoshi's level. 
I've spent some work comparing the difference in word entropy between all the possible Satoshi's. I've posted about it before, but nothing came of it despite initial optimism. If bitcoin-related words are left in the comparison, Gavin ranks well above everyone else, which is no surprise since he was the closest in working on the project in the same time frame and I think he had more of a learning curve than others like Adam Back, Ian Grigg, and Hal Finney, so he mimicked Satoshi more. But Gavin is not in the same league as smooth operators.
So I did an entropy comparison on Shaolinfry and Satoshi and Shaolinfry did not rank nearly as well as several other  cryptographers.  So if he is Satoshi, he's successfully foiled my methodology. If he was Satoshi and not tried foiling it, then it would have been a clear hit because I have 40k of Shaolinfry's words. Only n-grams can do better than relative entropy and since I use pairs and triples it's sort of like an n-gram sequence.

You can derive all characteristics of an ideal money from one underlying goal: constant value. An approximation is a basket of commodities. Going deeper, this approximation is based on the "joules" required to construct and run the commodity-producing equipment.  But the "joules" is not exactly a physical measurement. It includes a "difficulty" factor that society has in acquiring and utilizing them.  More precisely, it is Gibbs free energy. This may not be the ultimate measure because there is an "efficiency" aspect in how it's used even if the machine is 100% efficient in converting it to usable energy. There might be a subjective nature to how people need to define "constant value". The currency at least needs to expand with the size of the economy to keep constant value.  The ultimate goal is to keep the terms of contracts valid. But there is something else just as important: it needs to slowly devalue so that hoarding is discouraged and investment is motivated.  This prevents successful participants from relaxing. Evolution does not seek fairness. It seeks power. The most efficient participants retiring is not the goal.  It is just a carrot to motivate them. Slow devaluation is a way of erasing old debts which drives a rejuvenation of economic activity, redistributing wealth away from the 1% who naturally use wealth to guide markets into corners or to simply loan out at interest above the rate of coin inflation until they own all the coin via the "magic" of compound interest, further stifling growth from lack of coin and having more people to come beg for a loan. 
But the initial and short term goal is constant value so that CONTRACTS have a reference point that is exchangeable between all other contracts in any given legal system that is securing law in a marketplace.  The value should be constant in space and time, with some caveats like the needed inflation above, and remote places that do not have a large and diverse marketplace (the coin will have more value there).
That is the background you'll need to understand the following.  If BTC is going to be a currency instead of an asset (which provides the backing for real currencies), then it needs to fork as its use expands in order to maintain constant value, or it will have to let alts take away a greater and greater share of the growing cryptocurrency market.
So your point is correct only if BTC is going to be an asset.  Let currencies reference it in large quantities in a slow manner in something like the lightening network.  Assets and currencies are diametrically opposed if the asset has a capped quantity.  BTC and everyone who will use it and currently holds it want BTC to fork into many coins to maintain constant value if it is going to be a currency.  That is the underlying cause of the arguing.
I think you failed to appreciate Nash's "value stabilization".  Bitcoin is not a commodity. The joules needed to construct and run the mining equipment are a destruction of value but real mining adds value.  A real stable-valued commodity is not one that is not going to dry up in the near future. It stops being a commodity in a useful currency sense when that happens.  Granted, BTC as a commodity has a lot of features like gold:  expensive to mine verses its economic utility and largely capped in quantity (at least without a new tech advance in gold mining).  But this is why gold is more useful when a law-abiding marketplace is either non-existent, stagnant, or dying. Growing economies do not need or want gold except as a safety hedge against disaster (see previous sentence).
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:44:25
I updated my last paragraph to mention gold and BTC similarity. 
I'll look into Selgin. 
Now I'm not sure where we disagree so I'll re-read what you've posted.
I disagree that a measure of value in a market place is unavoidably arbitrary. If the "Gibbs free energy" connection is not fundamentally correct, the basket of commodities is pretty good. I believe it (or both) are founded upon letting the currency quantity (adjusted for velocity) be proportional to either the total non-artificially inflated assets in an economic system under its control which might be proportional to the "important fluid assets" of some sort (like the commodities).  I think by being proportional to what a group of people have under their "total relative control", it gives a gut feeling to how people define value.  If they become rich in having more assets nuder their control then it takes a larger quantity of the currency to feel like it has the same value. This breaks away from a direct joules measurement, but it leaves open the possibility of a joules per joules measure.  The joules of value a constant-value coin represents is a proportion of the total joules of value in a society.
The size and efficiency of their commodity-producing and delivering infrastructure should stay proportional to that wealth.  If the commodity machine starts struggling to meet demand and prices rise, then the coin is deflated to encourage investment in commodity infrastructure while reducing the strain on commodity production.  Then there is the converse.  
This discourages economic bubbles. Better commodity-based economics enables larger armies to destroy other economies. Democracy subverts capitalism towards higher commodity production instead of concentration of wealth.
This seems to break away from the joules/joules measurement, but I have a out: an ideal currency should not be a direct joules measure as I initially said, nor the proportion.  It should be also divided by the number of people.  If commodities got scarce, there is the implication there are too many people for the commodity infrastructure.  The commodity infrastructure should be valued relative to the number of people. So the coin is restricted with the commodities to make them both retain the same price (to keep contracts valid) and this makes people have less coin (worth less) and thereby work harder for the commodity production.
I've been trying to discover the connection between evolution, economics, and all other adaptive learning "machines" for years.  Here are my latest tweets in this effort.  I should point out all machines replacing biology are doing so because they are removing oxygen from metal, silicon and carbon "ores" which results in a far lower entropy per mass of the economic machine.  Hardness and reliability are deeply connected to lower entropy per mass.  There may be a connection between entropy and coin I have not discovered. Gibbs free energy touches upon it because 
GFE= joules + press*volume - entropy*temperature which is "energy available for work".  So I'll consider the possibility that entropy per mass decrease we are witnessing in our evolving economic system should be connected to a reducing quantity of coin per person.
My last tweets: 
Local heat/noise fluctuations under gravity/coin constraints discovers greater systemic efficiency when energy comes in &amp; entropy goes out.
Economics, evolution, &amp; learning are closed but not isolated thermodynamic systems. Energy in, entropy out. Entropy per mass reduces.

I disagree I'm Keynsian because following the basket requires a deflation when necessary. Again, the goal is value stability, which Nash said should be constant. This does not mean constant quantity. From online sources I can't see where I'm in disagreement with Nash, nor how the ICPI can be built backwards from currency competition because he says the ICPI "could be calculated from the international price of commodities".  Even my suggestion that money should devalue very much like a 2% inflation target is not an idea that he throws out: [wikipedia again] "The policy of inflation targeting, whereby central banks set monetary policy with the objective of stabilizing inflation at a particular rate, leads in the long run to what Nash called ‘asymptotically ideal money’ – currency that, while not achieving perfect stability, becomes more stable over time."  Moreover, the mild inflation idea as a way to slowly erase debts is something very important that Nash's "ideal money" does not take into account, so from what I see he's missing something crucial. It is possible his ideal money (perfect stability in value) is "ideal" only when the marketplace is ideally guided by "ideal law" that prevents money from concentrating into fewer hands in addition to enforcing basic rule of law in each transaction.  Wealth can concentrate from loans, monopolies, and lobbies improperly affecting laws.  It can also accumulate from efficiency gains due size, but a healthy system requires competition and dispersion, so I suspect allowing a company to gain over 50% of market share should be "made against the law" even if they followed all other aspects of ideal law. What to do with things that need 100% market share like roads and electricity remains a problem (letting two toll roads compete for the same route is rarely reasonable).
But wealth concentration into a few hands seems to be what a completely free market wants. Progressive tax to redistribute it back out is used in most countries. People get very wealthy as a result of riding society's wave of progress and technology more than any particularly great or noble intellect or skill. Instant billionaire status at age 25 after 4 years of work and near-zero capital investment makes no sense.  Getting back to my point:  mild inflation is a another check on inefficient, less powerful systems that allow wealth concentration. In ancient times, wealth concentration stifled society, then the people would revolt, install a new king or priest then all debts to the old "lords" weer erased. Jews learned to do it as a matter of course from other societies by declaring "jubilee" every 50 years.  Now we have inflation instead.
I can agree with "ideal money" instead of mild inflation if a different fundamental assumption is made:  if the wealth accumulation is prevented by something like progressive tax and smart laws on loans, then forcing constant value (zero inflation) on humanity would force everyone to become more efficient before expanding and go a long way to slow population growth and destruction of the biosphere (and in particular, not run into resource constraints so quickly, causing population collapse). 
But in reality faster expansion and waste that is helped by low inflation will overpower the ideal money's more conservative expansion.  
I am not sure currency should or needs to follow Zipf's law, but it appears it does, and therefore probably should. I agree competition in currency will result in an ideal currency, but knowing what the ideal outcome for people will be (or rather, the most likely-to-succeed outcome) is how you design the ideal money from scratch and then make it available. It also helps me in investing: I am more bullish on bitcoin if it forks. These ideas cause me to predict it will fork several times.
It must fork in order to achieve stable value as its use expands, either by alts or hard forks (which I guess is another name for an alt with a big pre-mine).  But the ideal is to find an objective definition and measure of commodity prices and figuring out the best way to expand and contract the supply as the prices change. I agree defining and measuring is a big problem. There must be an objective theoretical way to define "commodity" and the weighting factors needed.  An even bigger problem is measuring it without a 3rd party.   If the market is big enough does everything become a commodity? Should they be weighted based on how much people spend on them?  I believe it also needs slight inflation to help prevent concentration of wealth and the loan problem.  
The consumption (destruction) of joules is sometimes used by people like Szabo and XCP (and implied in bitcoin and b-money) to claim "this object has value because a lot went into its creation".  Rarity and antique-ness are used in a similar fashion.  Trading a commodity itself that required joules to create and maintains economic relevance of the joule's spent (e.g., copper, etc) seems to be a much better idea.  If we could trade a basket of commodities around with the ease of a fast cryptocoin, then we have an ideal.  
The starting point for how to weight the commodities is my previous suggestion: a coin = a fixed percent of Gibbs free energy available in society divided by the number of people.  By replacing my initial "joules" with a ratio, I've potentially removed the necessity of it being related to joules.  But joules seem to be the primary thing that creates and runs commodity producers. To be clear, 1 coin out of 100M coins would represent 1/100M control of the "total current commodity output".  
% coin owned of the total in "circulation" = % of society's total commodity-producing wealth divided by # people 
So if commodity production capacity and number of people is constant, then 1 coin is worth more in joules than in the past.  So maybe I should not mention joules to others, but it's important to my attempts to connect physics to evolution and economics.  (  The release of entropy from Earth is deeply connected to the expansion of the universe. I've work on that part as much, but it requires an audience that is already aware that the 2nd law of thermodynamics is not that "entropy always increase" (see Feynman's famous intro to physics books the 1st or 2nd thermo chapter) and that entropy is conserved on a comoving volume basis.  )
The velocity and availability of money and how to measure these will affect this in a way that I have no idea on how to measure. What is the total coin that is available for use at any given time?  It might be locked up in escrow based on contracts. How do asset price fluctuations fit into this?  Just watching commodity prices seems to solve all that.
If the economy has gotten bigger as measured by commodities trying to become cheaper, then the government would print new money to build more infrastructure to support the bigger economy (law, schools, roads) if the increase appears permanent, but it should be by lower interest rates if it seems like a temporary swing.  The government should be the only bank and primary loan agent. Interest on loans would replace all taxes on middle class.  
Nash's ideal money seems to miss the final key ingredient of "value" that I've included: dividing by the number of people.  It has the macroeconomic effect of weeding out weak people because coin (commodity-producing joules per person)  increases for everyone if the number of people decreases. There would be a macro-economic invisible hand to not overpopulate.   It stays constant if every person is more efficient but the joules each coin represents would be more.  So our measure of value has an intrinsic aspect as to what other people have.  If you consider this I believe it will resolve the "efficiency" problem we both mentioned.  So even with the low inflation I seek, the ideal money could discourage overpopulation and overly wasteful expansion.
The end result of all this is that Earth's mass will continue the current unavoidable physics-based path of congealing and hardening until all biology is replaced by machines.  The primary goal of devs is to replace brains just as motors replace muscle, and solar cells are replacing photosynthesis (20x more efficient per meter^2 and more efficient at self-replication).  Silicon is better than wet brains because the lower entropy per mass of hard silicon allows precise control of electrons whereas the brain has to deal with ions that weigh 50,000x more. Photosynthesis has 20x less ability to control the electrons via photon energy.
The goal of companies is to produce the most with the fewest people and with the fewest shareholders (stock buybacks and venture capitalists).  People are so outdated, even their capital is not needed by the machines except to gain market share (hotmail buyout, youtube buyout, snapchat, etc). AMZN  is an exception. See the zero marginal cost society. Welfare has been disastrous for the people in the U.S. receiving it, as bad as a 30 year war on that population.  The same thing will happen to the rest of humanity as we are no longer needed.  There's no good or bad. There's no solution. It's just the matter on Earth congealing to a colder, harder state in keeping with thermodynamics.

I rewrote my post in order to be a lot more coherent.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:02:27
If you shake a jar of objects that are in a gravity field, the objects will compact. Compaction is a lowering of entropy when all other variables are the same.  Entropy is conserved. The excess entropy escapes during the shaking as low-energy black-body radiation photons as a result of a heat increase from the shaking energy and friction.  Energy was converted to lower entropy in the jar, plus even more entropy that was released as the heat escaped.
In evolution, the shaking energy is the Sun and moon. I've written on the importance of the moon to life on Earth.  The mass on Earth is constrained to the surface which is the jar. 
In economics and A.I. energy obviously is coming in from the outside, and heat is escaping. There is also a lowering of entropy per mass as in the jar and evolution. Law and Earth are the jar. Currency is a conveyance of energy between participants in accordance with the constraints.  To allow greater compaction in a jar, sometimes you need more room for new positions to be discovered.  In A.I. they periodically relax variables so that they can take on different values before they are slowly constricted again.  This enables it to get out of non-optimal solutions. There is also a redistribution of wealth at times in A.I. to make sure it does not get stuck in local minimums (the 1% taking over).

I ran a Perl script on 1 of Szabo's closely related articles and on Satoshi's white paper to compare the word pairs and word triples. The comparison made on a blog earlier this week did not make any statistical sense and he's not approving any comments to be posted below his article.  
The important thing is to completely ignore anything related to the topic.  The only interesting thing is the phrase "at will" which seems a bit unusual to find in 2 documents by two supposedly different people.  
Szabo's document I used is this one, which is a very good read.
In comparing the single Szabo document (4000 words) with the single Satoshi document ( 3000 words), the more interesting (less likely accident) 2 and 3 word pairs not specifically common to cryptography are (with most interesting first): “at will”, “we propose a”, “to choose between”, “depend(s) on” [3 times in each document] “would be to”, “moore’s law”, and “made by the”. Seems very borderline. “Moore’s law” does not count much since the topic depends on its progression. “We propose” means it’s two instances of a single name at the top of a paper that has others behind it …. which is kind of interesting, especially since Szabo had no need to conceal others (he acknowledges help from others at the bottom).  Wei Dai and Szabo were involved in a crypto-anarchist group.  “Unstructured simplicity” was the only possible give away I was able to find.

**Micro-Control of Coin Value**
I've only thought about broad strokes but at the smallest transaction level coins could take on higher or lower value according to the scripts in order to implement "governing".  For example forcing cigarretes at the transaction level to be more expensive than they otherwise would be and offsetting this with decreasing the cost of lung cancer treatment.  So it's a tax and subsidy. We already do it but we have an enormously in-efficient system for implementing it.  Somehow the decisions have to be made, so it's still a full fledge government.
**Basket Weighting**
The basket should be based on a weighted proportion of the commodities currently available for sale with the weighting based on the total dollar amount of each commodity currently being used.  I would go with the top 20 commodities to keep things simple for the algorithms that would be automatically calculating the proper value and become part of the n of m consensus. 
**Intelligence-Seeking Coins**
There should be an ECONOMY for voting who is the best political leader or for who has the best economic ideas, not 1 vote per person.   It would draw from artificial intelligence ideas on ensembles of  dumb agents that can achieve intelligent outcmoes and evolutionary algorithms.  For example, Amazon.com's review system allows votes to identify the best reviews, so you don't need to depend solely on the average star rating. The higher intelligence rises to the top.
I doubt anything I've described will be consciously attempted, except for what Szabo and Satoshi already had in mind as bitcoin was created (see Nick Szabo's papers [Trusted Third Parties Are Security Holes]( and [Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority]( if you want a further understanding of why Satoshi invented bitcoin).  What will happen is that the scripts will simply evolve to further economic development with winners and losers and the end does not promise survival or optimal happiness.  I should mention that as crypto-anarchists (aka crypto-freedom fighters) Dai, Szabo, and Satoshi might gasp at some of the things I'm suggesting their currency be used for.  Nothing in Nick Szabo's or Michael Hudson's economics blog address human happiness.  They assume an efficient marketplace with fair transactions will produce a good outcome.  Their economic philosophies, although far superior to anything else I can find, only produce a powerful economy that has no goal except expansion.  At least Hudson leaves it up to votes to determine the system-wide goals.  An intelligent "governing" control of the currency during transactions is needed to produce good system-wide goals, replacing banks with bitcoin and governments with the scripts that define the bitcoin values.  Already life should be a lot easier than it is for everyone. Lack of technology and lack of fuel has never been our problems.  Not intelligently working together for system-wide profit has been the problem.

In any event, bitcoin won't be used for store or market-place orders with cell phones because it's too slow.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:18:45
Yes, central authority = potential problems if governments get in the way. There could be 5 copycat commodity currencies like this per country.  You would use them at first for transactions more than storage of wealth.  Maybe later you trust one enough to be storage of wealth. 
More easily used in 3rd world and even 1st world because you can't or would not want to use Litcoin or bitcoin at most in-person transactions because they are too slow.  2 minutes standing at a checkout waiting?  
Also in the 3rd world transaction amounts are small value.  So the per transaction tax issued by the governing core programmers is transferring wealth from the poor to the wealthy by giving the wealthy bitcoin holders a free ride in securing their wealth.  I know the programmers are thinking logically that "fair is fair" and "pay for use" of the miners, but that will decrease the number of people who use the coin and thereby decrease the number of miners that can be support if a "flat tax" were issued based on amount instead of this regressive tax based on transactions.  And maybe a 51% attack is looking only for the large transactions to rip off.  Certainly miniscule transactions need to be taxed higher because those will be colored coins in action protecting expensive contracts and such.  Taxing per transaction is free market idea, but this is an example where if you applied a strict free market way of thinking, then the whole economy suffers and the number of miners decrease.  Free market benefits only those at the point of sale without regard to 3rd parties and system-wide health.   Intelligence does not magically emerge from competitive selfishness.  All for one and one for all works better than every man for himself.
