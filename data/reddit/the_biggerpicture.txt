Ive actually met thw winklevoss brothers on halloween 2010 at a party in nyc, and i remember them saying "we gotto go we have to row crew in the morning". It was my friends party, the dog &amp; pony show, i believe it was at the rivington hotel.

It consolidated for a while, so the move was either up or down, had nothing to do with gov shutdown.  Everytime btc makes a move, someone correlates it to the closest news article.

Yeah, ive been through this before. I can imagine the guys that got in much lower than me lol, they prob dont give a shit at ALL.
It wasnt foresight btw, it was a friend who told me about its use cases- i had heard about it, but he really layed down what it was all about for me, and from there i fell in love with it. I think we have a loooong ways to go still :). It aint over!!

“Eating pizza and paying in bitcoin is fantastic, unimaginable a decade ago. Complements to TOMS.”
Hes talking about the pizzeria TOMS extreme pizza (i believe in missouri) that posted they are accepting bitcoin recently. 
Kudos to the guys from toms
Hes asking if its possible to do a twin business with a pizzeria in MOLISE. I think it has something to do with the business structure, not too sure but i know towns in italy do this with towns from other countries. He would have to clarify on that
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:03:12
The chart changed, february said 27k. Wondering if he reevaluated

Haha. When you get in early and your still in the green its ok 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:17:31
So you're telling me, if bitcoin goes back to 17k this month, we should attribute it to the govt shutdown? And if it moves 800% this month- we should also say it was the govt shutdown?
So its not just how markets work? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:42:04
Haha awesome, i dont have a 220 im hoping these 2 3000w step ups will work. Its only one line too, we'll see what happens i guess. Fingers crossed

Exactly. He trades smart. He waits for signals and lets people know possible scenarios, nust because hes bullish or bearish when other people arent doesnt mean hes a bad trader or is misleading people.

JP morgan owns the ships, shipping companies lease them, its real estate. Big money.

Will be the last extension that is made by the SEC. if no decision is made by the march date, the etf will be approved by default. I am guessing the winklevii twins will move said proposal to another country onto a different exchange and seek approval elsewhere.

@_date: 2017-02-23 14:10:45
I would wait for the COIN ETF final decision from the SEC and go from there. Not for certain if either way it will be a huge impact, but say we hit 1200 and the sec decides no, some people are going to sell, it may go down, you can sell and buy back at a lower price. And if it goes the other way and the sec decides yes, hold, or HODL rather. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:51:28
Waiting for SEC approval?  I wonder if the decision of one would affect the decision of the others?

No i mean i havent cashed out yet so i wouldnt know on that end. Its good for me so that im at least purshasing some bitcoin each week. I forget about it and it adds up. It tells you all the stats, when you bought, for how much, what your gains or losses are.

Just saying if its a currency it sucks at being one.  I cant send you my gold right now if i wanted to, but btc i sure can. Gold i would have to convert, sell it and cash it in.
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:34:35
My expectation was "scuse me?"   Or "say that again" like i usually get. I absolutely would have loved to have a conversation with him if time had permitted.  What would you expect if you ask a person (overseeing some sort of payment system) about accepting bitcoin?  I would love to start using it, but yeah it was probably the conversation i was looking for lol. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 02:39:15

hopefully it gets to that point, as an alternative. But yeah all those alternative payment methods would be cool. A payment method not attached to a certain type of phone would be more universal, if btc got that big of course. Would be nice.

I saw a post on here with a link to a site that showed how much money and what country it was coming from.  China being the main producer, its yuan devaluation and capital controls are the cause of people fleeing to bitcoin. And in my opinion that money will not be sold high because obviously people wont cash in for the yuan since its devaluing, seems to me the price wont go much lower than it is then, unless alot of people will be taking profit. We'll see i guess.

I see it not being used as a currency before the price starts evening out when its way way higher, u til then store of value money will be pouring in to get to that point. I would love to see it hit 14k.  I dunno i feel like with the halvening and no mt gox to fuck shit up its gonna go way higher, then again i can be wrong. 
Hopefully at least 3000 usd per btc
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:28:57
I use it, on top of the btc i purchased i set it up to buy me 50 usd worth per week of btc. I like it, its like clockwork and adds up and hopefully in a few years it will be grow into a nice amount.

Ok so when they sell all those shares do they buy more? I have a feeling this is gonna do great compared to actual BTC in (in the short term at least)
Once the etf reaches a certain price, instead of buying more they can always split the stock price to keep the price low and more attractive to buyers. 
Is the etf directly correlated to the price? Or would the price be a percentage of the market cap itself. This looks really interesting i have so many questions!!

When i was younger i always thought to myself, self, why isnt there one type of money for the whole world to use. And i thought and daydreamed that we would all be a creamy beige and all speak one language. 20 something years later it feels like its happening, i travel the world and everyone speaks english more and more and the monetary system isnt working anymore, and somwthing like bitcoin comes along. It seems like its happening, slowly but surely there will be a world money. Will bitcoin be it? Who knows. There might not be a choice, it may happen and nobody can stop it, so if they cant beat it they will join it. Thats what we are hoping for anyways, but its gonna be a rough road, and i dont want to bet on humanities demise for this to happen, thats fucked up.

Ive heard mixed reactions about the last bubble. Some people say it was the halving, some the cyprus and greece thing, and some say it was a little of both. I watched a video not too long ago with a guy explaining the last bubble had nothing to do with greece and it was purely the halvening. Whats your take on that?  I dont know what to think if these things really have an effect other than traders and speculation.
@_date: 2018-10-30 16:36:22
I hope so! I understand the markets arent correlated but investor sentiment is investor sentiment, when markets go down people get tight with their money. I dont see bitcoin doing the opposite of markets until such markets are dead at a stand still. Thats my opinion tho. But like i said, i hope it does go up- and i hope people do start seeing BTC as a safe haven or alternative store of value!

Hoping its governments buying in! But unlikely, ive also heard most huge deals are done off-exchange as to not affect the market too much. Good question tho! Would love to see some more input on this.

Maybe blockchain will be something that people will come to understand, and theyll think “well hey, if blockchain is good, then money on the blockchain must be good” i think it will take a while, maybe a few more years- but look at how much its worth and how many people even own bitcoin? Imagine when everybody buys a little piece. Lets say even merchant adoption has a little spike and you have to refill your bitcoin wallet every now and then to go shopping, if somethinf like that becomes popular, fughettaboutit

You may be locked in at that price they just never confirmed the order, holy shit. This may be legit. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:07:43
The people who bought later than earlier will not sell at the price that the people who bought bitcoin earlier will sell at. For as many people that will sell at 10000, there is that many that are waiting till 100,000, i personally believe when it dips it will go back up. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:05:30

@_date: 2019-06-03 14:30:12
No necessarily, sentiment changes- the exchanges can hold more volume, fomo changes. I dont see how a four year cycle can hold percentages over decade. I think something will give, either way. I mean its possible that the four year cycle can predict bear and bull markets, but down to percentages and exact times- not really. What do you think?

Yeah i saw it too was interested because the dollar vigilante posted it, along with an interview of their ceo, seems ok. I was interested because i always thought "wouldnt it be great if EXCHANGES offered free trading and were decentralized. You risk losing money if you suck at trading, and if your good you lose less money. Dont see how it is a scam. But who the hell knows.
@_date: 2017-04-28 02:23:20
I feel the a.i. Wouldnt showcase motive like the many use cases of bitcoins, why was bitcoin created?
For who?
Ok so the a.i. disguises this worldwide distributed ledger as a disruptive currency commodity etc that can never be destroyed as long as there is incentive to keep it running, all for the sake of existing forever and to dominate the world? 
i think a human with an opinion has to come up with something like bitcoin. Unless a.i. Could actually have intellectual free will then it seems almost impossible. Whats the motive?

Yes!! Same for me! Same company!! Ryan air! I didnt even know they accepted cash so i was bummed when they said my credit card did not work, pleasantly surprised when they said they accepted cash- and bummed again when nobody had change. I thought the same thing, if only they had bitcoin. I think the credit card machines had no internet so international fees would not work, so how would btc work there? It would get confirmed into a cashe until they land?
Edit: By any chance, was this a rather small flight from italy? Probably same flight attendant
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:48:24
I just read that we cant (as americans) even invest in the petro. We would probably be arrested as traitors. So dont worry.

There is a chance it will increase. If it was created as a way to go around us sanctions, and other people will be trading on it- then my faith in more of the world hating America than Maduro gives me a feeling this may just increase.

Word. You can buy i think i dont know about trading. I know if you plan on opening a money service type think you need a bitlicense. 
Definitely open a coinbase account, maybe use bitcoin atms sparingly, it wouldnt hurt to have some completely anonymous coin. Get yourself a hardware wallet like keepkey or trezor. Store em on there
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:00:21
Feels good that most of us got on before this douche.
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:11:38
 Think bitcoin was designed exactly for that, better store of value. I mean you shouldnt risk everything, but ive been buying 50 dollars worth a week since 2014 on top of my initial investment, and every one of those 50 dollar increments is worth more today. 
But again, i guess dont risk more than you can afford. Maybe to offset he can take a percentage of his earnings back each week?

@_date: 2017-09-19 00:56:09
Hell no, its flattering that so many are trying to recreate something that was created so the banks wouldnt have control of it. But its exactly that- the main point of bitcoin is to get around the big banks, and all their schemey slimey ways. They are trying to recreate something when they can just simply use bitcoin. Like fuckin get on it or get left behind. 
It says something HUGE when they say they are trying to recreate this technology. Fuck them tho.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:46:27
Buy 25 bucks worth a week. Each of those 25 buck increments will only be worth more in the future. Whatever amount you put in you are still making the same percentage on your money like everyone else. And youll be ahead of the game when you finally get a nice amount to throw down on it having already invested, its also called dollar cost averaging.

Overall market sentiment will be bullish and people will start buying, thats smart money. The banks will start looking to uncorrelated assets, and the people will follow. When nobody is getting returns on anything and bitcoin is still offering returns best believe people will buy.

How are they off the market? They can be off an exchange. I know off market transactions are just private keys being sold off an exchange. Or maybe i just dont know how it really works. Still things i do not understamd.

Yeah i dont feel like thats the general public, i feel that its the bankers sentiment. Public persuasion is whatever the news gives. So if good news is being spewed about bitcoin at the moment, that will be its view from the majority. Its either or. 
The people with the vested interest in blockchain technology are the bankers who CANT support bitcoin because it threatens their very existence. So how do you jump on board without being "pro" currency that can wipe out your existence?  Get on its underlying technology and claim that blockchain is usefull on its own, which im sure it is- but they are not admitting to themselves that bitcoin is a much better currency/investment as opposed to anything they can offer. 
I also really dont feel like the general public knows blockchain even exists, the people judging probably have no clue. Thats why they are so quick to dismiss it all as a scam or a bubble.

First off, dont let nothing fuck with your sobriety. One day at a time!!! Secondly, hold that shit, so when a year is gone and you been sober, and your well adjusted, you can make a decision on Wat Do. 
Hold that shit. 
My brothers an addict, i bought 2 bitcoin for him at 600 ea without his knowledge. Hes almost 40 and has shit to his name, hopefully it will be a cushion for him in a couple of years when he is good and ready maybe he can buy a place to live or something.

If paypal did it, it would just be another segway for people to get involved, only of the fees were less than that of paypal itself.  Should paypal however use bitcoin on the back end, where moneys tranfered were only done in bitcoin and then back out to us dollars, paypal would increase their worth not only from transaction fees, but bitcoin holdings as well.

When you get in at a real low price anything other than what you payed for is a good price.  We obviously know that institutional investors arent here yet, nor are the common folk, that being said, ill take the boom and busts.  
Ive been in long enough to realize that the people interested in it are in for the long haul and with every dip comes more buying... greater than selling. Thats a good enough equation for me.

Yeah makes sense. I remember above 2500 you need to scan your Drivers License and some security and id measures like that. Now that would be like less than half of one btc.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:07:38
I really hope its just regulatory, not that it matters because btc was meant to circumnavigate financial institutions and govts, but for the publics sentiment.. we are still at that level where we need someone to say "its ok"

The fraction stays the same, the price is what goes up whether you have .005 bitcoin or 1 bitcoin. If the bitcoin price increases 10% in a day, whatever you hold also increases 10%.
Bitcoin goes up 100 dollars
You have .25 bitcoin.  (1/4) of bitcoin
The value of your bitcoin holdings increases 25 dollars. 
If you have .5 bitcoin (half a bitcoin)
The value of that bitcoin would be +$50.00
Got it?

I could only think about the house prices SKY ROCKETING because families will have 2/3/4 thousand a month extra to play with. I feel like cars computers and prices on everything would exponentially increase because that thought of “eh, we have to lower the price, people wont pay that amount for this product” that business owners have wont be there anymore.

by the time i pay 10 dollars per debit card transaction, or the terrible exhange rate that money exchanges give me, then transaction fee, or plus atm (from atm + bank) its better to take money out of my bitcoin atm. Plus my bitcoin was purchased minus 200 so for me its worth it.

I think there will be another sideways consolidation, then up, and another resistance at 2000. At 2000 i think there will be a pullback to the 1850 range and then right back to 2000 before consolidating and then blowing past the 2000 mark. I feel like the last two pullbacks were due to bad news of china, etf, etc. 
Hopefully there is enough interest now that we are in a different ballgame then the "below 1200" levels. But who knows- this is the mystery of magical internet money.

I just want to be able to pay my bills, have enough cashflow where i can take care of me and mine.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:00:08
Yeah, i think the people that purchased from 17k-20k will buy more when it surpasses 20, and new people will buy more. All these predictions people are seeing say anywhere between 25k-100k, even tho they may not be factual or hold any weight- this is a collective of thoughts people have. I really think (and hope) this will happen.

Because they are probably tightening up security, seems like its all regulated where they want the btc on their exchange FROM there exchange.  I dunno whats going on with coinbase but, its getting real tight real quick.

@_date: 2016-07-12 05:22:13
If the price jumps to 10,000, i would sell 1.  As that would be about my initial investment. if the price hits 10,000 a few years after it would go to 100,000, and then i would sell 20 and keep the rest for safekeeping and fuckin retire from this misery of a job.

What do you mean?  like we're gonna go lower still? I mean we can't time the market, but you have to figure all this new money coming in, some of it has to stay. I mean lets hope so at least. 21/2200 (mean) aint so bad if we consolidate for a couple months

Also, i can trade btc on my phone, ON MY PHONE! While im sitting on the bowl- im not great at trading but sometimes theres these almost “cant lose”scenarios. Im not a huge risk taker so the few hundred in trades a make a year i just keep in BTC, another way to grow your portfolio :)

From what ive seen, this is what i feel will happen, also i dont trade. I hodl.
@_date: 2016-07-12 04:20:12
Last time this happened, with such a longways consolidation, the price skyrocketed. If you look on youtube (Bitcoin Geekend) the guy starts comparing bolinger bandwidth from now, and that the last time there was such a short squeeze the price jumped. I believe right before the last halving. 
Obviously nothing is for certain but it is interesting. I too was expecting a sell off, but maybe it will stay like this for a while and that may be a good thing. Upward selling pressure and people not fearing the halving anymore could have a positive effect on price. We'll see.

Yeah i recommended a friend to use coinbase, and he tried uploading his i.d. And they said they cant help him right now pretty much. I tried uploading a picture of my i.d. And it doesnt work. That may just be an app issue but its annoying, also cant upload my debit card info for instant purchases. Seems like the customer service is going downhill.
@_date: 2019-05-29 00:49:44
Im talkimg from experience, ive been dollar cost averaging for 4 years and made myself a nice position, you dont know if bitcoin is gonna keep going up or not, most alt coins will flop or just follow btc’s trend on its way up, so timong the market if you are that good at it, then sure- take the risk. Sounds like a good plan, dont get greedy. But while you are waiting for the next bear market you could be making on your little increment Investments weekly if you believe we are in a bull market. Its all up to you tho, weigh your options.
@_date: 2019-05-23 02:47:07

@_date: 2019-05-29 00:16:59
Screw altcoins, buy bitcoin, dollar cost average at 50 bucks a week with that 1000 and if you can keep it going forever, those 50 dollar increments will be worth 50+, 100, 200, 300 etc etc. 
But of course this isnt investment advice, just my opinion :)

Faster than people believe. These price marks coming up (10k,15k,20k) are not unchartered territory. We’ve been there before, i think we will reach them and surpass them quicker than the first time. We still have 7 months to go this year. Alot can happen in seven months haha. But who the hell knows. Maybe 40k years end. Maybe 50k maybe 1300 like tone vays been saying forever haha

Back in the day around 2007 there was this "six degrees of seperation" game called satoshi. I dont know too much about it, but maybe it holds a clue.  Maybe its mark zuckerburg, who had a facination with bringing people together, and thats why the winklevii twins are all up on it. Just a thought.

College students can be 18/19 years old. Who in their right mind is financially savvy at that age? Few and far between! Also, were they asked “1 bitcoin” or or “1 btc” or were they asked “if one bitcoin is worth 8000 dollars, would you want 1 dollar or 1 bitcoin”

Thats what i was thinking
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:35:30
Im in the green as long as bitcoin stays above 300. I feel bad watching people panic, but at one time i purchased at the top! While i was setting up bitcoin and figuring it all out, btc was shooting up from around 240- 1100. I remember buying at 300, then at 400 then  at like 600 and then when i saw it hit 1000 i was like “this thing isnt gonna stop!” And I bought a few more. Then that first crash all the way down to about 190 happened and i purchased a bunch then and more and more until it hit like 700 again a couple years later. My bulk was low tho, one of the only smart decisions i ever made was buying when everyone thought it was going to “0” 
So my point is you may think you purchased at the top, but give it a couple more years you will be happy lol.
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:54:42

@_date: 2018-12-11 01:14:14
Its a scam. Stop trying to make up stories of what it could be. Its a fake site that looks exactly like coinbase, you put your login info, and they keep it. Then if you dont have 2FA set up. You are screwed and they can steal your funds, then if they get your icloud info, they can probably copy your phone and have the 2FA sent to a clone phone. Ok maybe thats a little much. But who the hell knows. Definitely a scam tho!
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:37:38
I wonder of people will hold their btc on ethereum during the split, and buy back into btc later?

@_date: 2017-06-28 11:06:25
I just feel like there is so much demand that every time it dips traders will buy in, and people looking to invest will buy in. Going sideways for a couple months makes more sense than a bear run. If there is a bear run im confident we wont go below 1000. I am fine with with that- it givea more room for new money. Most of the uncertainty in the market has been washed out, i think people know it is here to stay. Hopefully that floor support around 2200 keeps holding and being retested. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:42:52
Not saying its not possible just wondering how you came to that number 
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:15:00
In the us youd get charged just a retainer fee for the case. No lawyer over here is going to say "pay me for the hour it took me to write the letter" 
If its true and thats possible. Then that would be amazing.

@_date: 2017-06-28 20:10:47
What do you mean 1 year? Like from the past few months could very well be a bullish penant, but.. the only thing is the last spike didnt break the previous spikes high, or maybe that previous spike was just overbought. But it does aftually look like its forming a penant, however there are lower highs, so doesnt look so bullish to me if it is a penant at all. Who knows tho.

I just buy on coinbase, people have a lot of shit to say but i havent had any problems. Between my initial investment and all the 50 dollar a week dollar cost averaging im happy to say if btc hits 60k i can retire at the ripe old age of 36/37. I hope everyone buys a little a week because time is fleeting and before you know it 5 years has past. Its a long term game- in hindsight whoever does this will be super happy! Nothing has showed me returns like bitcoin.
