because you don't work in finance. I am surrounded by screens playing BNN and CNBC all day. BNN is actually better imo since CNBC is just flash and US political bs 90% of the time.

Well bitcoin is a Fiat currency,  it does not have intrinsic value just like the USD. If people did not agree on using it as an exchange medium then it would be essentially valueless as it does not really have a next best use. 
Gold is very similar in that central bank and speculative investment demand in the alternative asset universe drives most of its global demand annually. If people only valued it for decoration/jewellery and its commercial applications,  then it's price would decline significantly.

It was on the front page because there is a trend of people taking money out of the sidelines and buying equity again. This is cash that moved away from equities since the crash in 2008 where people bought up precious metals and investment grade bonds (AAA-BBB rated) en mass. The S&amp;P 500 for example recently broke 2007 highs. This is interesting because most assessments of developed world economies show less than enviable employment levels and GDP growth.

I read this article this morning. I think what people tend to miss is that there is a bitcoin fund that is being approached by money managers offering investments of $100 mn. If funds start buying bitcoin... that amount of demand would significantly boost prices up.

income tax does not work like that. this is how it works:  
if the tax brackets are 20% for income less than 20k and 40% for income over 20k, then 20k will be taxed at 20%, any income over 20k will be taxed at 40%. Lets say you made 40k, then you will pay 12k in taxes.

Oh wow, I just watched one of his interviews. OP has a point.
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:57:54
You shouldn't. If you believe in commodities such as gold you can put money into that as it has a much longer track record of keeping some value, though I don't really agree with it being some kind of store of value, that is all speculation in my opinion. You should also look at other traditional investments such as long equity positions. If you are looking for stability in your savings then investing in a well diversified equity portfolio in companies with solid financials and a long track record of sustainable growth such as Nestle would be an option. Companies such as Nestle at least create products that people value and use daily.

Being so new no one knows how to value it. There is lots of speculation, many people do not understand what bitcoin is and how it works, there integration with markets is very limited, and exchange volumes are very low, combine that with the fact that no laws surround price manipulation of bitcoin and you get the potential for market manipulation and gaming. One group, or a reasonably well off individual may be manipulating the exchange price in order to do a pump and dump maneuver.

Funny scandal imo. The CEO from RBC was Nixon, the staffing company is called iGate. I'm dubbing it the currygate scandal. (no racist)

Thank you for your insight wiki master.  Perhaps you should read a bit further down the page under the section called monetary economics. Government backing is not a requirement for fiat currency.

Took me a while to realize that you didn't buy numerous 60 GH/s miners with that money... It would have been better to just order 12 now at the end of the line.

Wow. So no one here is capable of reading past the first paragraph in a wiki article.  
  
"In monetary economics, fiat money is an intrinsically useless product, used as a means of payment. In some micro-founded models of money, fiat money is created internally in a community making feasible trades that would not otherwise be possible, either because producers and consumers may not anonymously write IOUs, or because of physical constraints."

usually 50% of capital gains are taxed in north america and certain capital gains are tax exempt, you would need to reference the tax code in the specific country you are taxable in to find out the actual tax implications.

It's a toss up since banks can say they were taking the more prudent measure as there was no Canadian precedent in place back then. The process with which the accounts were closed will probably be called into question however.
