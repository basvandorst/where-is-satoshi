His trend pushing is like pump &amp; dump. simply not good advice for listeners and for bitcoin is my conclusion

By noobs and newcomers you mean traders?

not really familiar with that. Seems a lot but there is no new separation, some limitations and more "oversight".
I don't think they did enough after the 2008 financial crisis.

and needed a minimum wage (next to other things). i said wealth distribution, not wealth. in general (the distribution is world wide failing) the really super rich don't only have 1 or 2 million.
but yes we had never as many millionaires as now, but it doesnt mean everbody has the chance to or germans are rich. USA is even richer but is everbody good there? BTW how many millionaires are there in Venezuela? ��

you heared of this thing called wealth distribution (and the direction we are all heading)? only some people are very wealthy.

this full zdf show (die anstalt 05.04.2016) sumarized it pretty good:
the state knows the poor the best. should we talk about america and ALL the millionaires in congress?
edit: in average 5 million per person in germany wow..
@_date: 2019-03-28 08:32:20
wrong again. most people has wealth in things like realestate, should they sell it.
and btw the very rich are often excluded from the wealth statistics.
@_date: 2019-03-12 07:41:19
no, we see it has no effect on bitcoin price. is'nt it that what you mean and what some questionable oversimpified political propaganda is telling us here all the time? 
Just do not go with this awful propaganda. I for myself don't really know what is going on in Venezuela. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 08:05:37
doge wow
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:26:09
thats basically what most banks do today. we have no separation of normal commercial banking and investment banking. 1933 after the finance crisis glass-steagall act came up to protect against it, but Clinton 1999 reversed it. so...  is it legal scam? do we really need less state regulatories in this point?
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:14:30
lol Asse II has corroding barrels that have to be get out again and the other can't be right either. in germany are no permanent "Endlager", only temporarily. that's what they say to the public. funny enough, the english article says Endlager, the german article only that the company has the words eearching for permanent deposit in it.
Just saying this last comment: Wikipedia is a heavy target foe opinion manipulation. i said be aware of lobbyism.. your behavor is strange. eod
edit2: ok morleben was approved by the east german government long time ago. that doesnt mean it fits actual standards anymore. funny that you don't bring up sush things. i wonder (not)

this is a bitcoin forum and not pro nuclear power, but no i meant veeeery long term radiating nuclear waste. No single place for it found on the whole planet. 
Windmills have magnets in it, Solarpanels maybe a bad (for Recycling) covering layer but its nothing againsf the problematics with the nuclear waste and the costly removal of old power plants.
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:48:24
Really? So you live near a nuklear power plant or nuklear waste depot?
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:04:02
exactly, a real issue.
@_date: 2019-10-12 07:24:37
@_date: 2019-08-24 12:27:10
ok i have enough if this discussion. Sorry for the lobby bullshit.
"Nuclear waste doesn't trigger a catastrophic chain reaction either. To create a chain reaction you need to have a nuclear bomb."
i doesnt meant that and you probably know it. or do you not know that radiation is not good for living beings? Meant that kind of chain reaction.. nuclear waste into the ocian.. food chain and such things? but is similar irresponsible and sophisticated to build nuclear bombs and build more and more nuklear reactors (both go hand in hand btw) without better solutions for the waste. waste is the biggest problem, transport is also risky.
good, have your viewpoint, but really, consider to question where this opinion came from ��
"I linked one of the many permanently safe places already. Again, safe is relative."
"10 000 years" are not permanently
can they even the 10000 years foresee? it's just questionable and not a fact because they declared it like that (in 1970)
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:42:41
for you too. but be aware for lobbyism
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:17:08
if you are from the uklear energy lobby please communicate this clearly
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:20:01
except for the fact that nobody has a solution for the waste
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:36:20
again do you know a more permanently safe place?
if someone falls down the stairs he dosnt triggers a catastrophic chain reaction.
wow your argumentation. you said you are not payed by a lobby, you are really good at it.. why not get payed? they have the money
@_date: 2019-10-12 10:49:48
he means we are to comfy with the 'store of value' and 'digital gold' aspect of bitcoin and many are preaching this (since 2017). things like libra have a chance to dominate the payment market more quickly with easier user experience.
google and apple pay are already starting in mobile payments

if price is rising it is for sure that mining incentive is rising also. 
that alone can make it a big problem, and it will if the price is rising a big amount
I mean its then profitable with more dirty energy as well again.

so where?
@_date: 2019-10-19 12:07:28

yes but the problem is, it is not really fully under control and missused and so on. i think the humanity is also to dumb to manipulate dna... but we do it already..

there is no place found on the whole planet for permanently storing the dangerous waste. (uranium ammonition is no smart solution either) (sorry for triggering your pro nuclear energie stance again, but waste is an important thing to consider before handling this technology imho)
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:53:59
the good thing, wars have nothing to do with us 99% fiat users and 100% citizens of any country. (ironically)

do not listen to traders in forums or trollboxes ��
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:35:19
Many think so
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:19:01
it is very relevant, as the other example in germany (Asse II, "temporary storage") was a massive fail. it was declared to be save for a period of time, but it was NOT. Water was flowing in and also there was stored all sorts if waste, that was not planed.
i criticized wikipedia and heavy lobby propaganda for a reason. it is relavant to your behavor and this nice clean wp article. wikipedia is not longer neutral in this kind of things and also in politics.
btw in the beginning, people found it a good idea to dump nuclear waste in secret in the ocean. we know today iron barrels in salt water was not really a good idea.
edit: so your example is declared safe for 10000 years in 1970. it needs to be guarded for 10000 years and money etc, resistent to all kinds of natural changes.
For this you stand? it is also no permanent solution for sure.. i asked for that

to finally clear this up for the bitcoin community:
there are nobel prizes and there is a non-official similar sounding nobel memorial prize for economics
"The prize was established in 1968 by a donation from Sweden's central bank... " ��

it's selling Bitcoin for Dollars or buying Dollar. you would not say cashing out the opposite way or if you would trade a fiat pair. Even not selling gold is "cashing out".
in a casino you do, or if you are a gambling trader. (dont gamble!)
