I like this quote from David: "Math is correct and repeatable; and there are not many equations that become greedy and corrupt."

This will be a great event, the first of its kind. Really looking forward to the convergence of excellent speakers in both the bitcoin space and the overall "future of money" conversation.

Looks like a great event!

Whoa, that's awesome. Hopefully with the growth of more bitcoin payment services like Xapo and Cryptex Card, it'll be even easier to travel abroad using bitcoin.

Heads up, early bird registration for this event ends today!

Sounds like a great event! It's great to see a Bitcoin conference expand beyond the cryptocurrency to the larger conversation about the future of money and digital finance.

"A network for crypto-ownership and storage that does for data what Bitcoin does for value." Very interesting. Will be interesting to follow how Maidsafe grows.
