I got one small trade in. Still lagging but not 20% discount anymore. :( 
Was within 5% after 5minutes. Insider info looks like to get those quick trades.

You’re taxed on mined coins as ordinary income once you receive it in your wallet.

Tax guy here. 
The moment the valued for exchange takes place is the moment the gain was realized. So if you have 100,000 worth of bitcoin and you buy a car for 25,000, depending on the amount you paid would dictate the gains. Say 10,000 initial investment so DOllar Cost Averaging would be 1/3 of your gains at the time. 
In reality you can just pay the lower cap gains of 15,000 at your marginal tax bracket or 15% if you have held a year. Try to hold a year or get a line of credit on the BTC when they become available. Rather pay 4% interest on a line for a few months and not 25% on gains.

So most accounts held at large institutions can have lines of credit held against them. Think of it like a home equity line. They’ll give you a certain percentage of the account as a line of credit at an interest rate. Say 6%. The riskier the underlying assets the lower the percentage of the account. The higher the account size the lower the interest rate. 
So if the interest rate of the borrowed amount against the pledged assets is lower than the increase in taxes of short term versus long term, borrow.

I was going to argue with you. We are the most Southern. We are in North Florida.
