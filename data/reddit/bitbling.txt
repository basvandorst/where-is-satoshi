They have an adhesive sticker for inside windows:
I've bought adhesive stickers from bitstickers.net, and they're great. If you're looking for static-cling window stickers (no adhesive, easy to remove), I sell them at BitBling:
I made them specifically because I wanted to put a sticker on my own car's rear window, and I couldn't find anybody else that sold static-cling window stickers.

If you're still looking, I'm selling “Bitcoin Accepted Here” window stickers at:
These are static-cling vinyl window stickers. The benefit over regular stickers is that static-cling stickers are easy to apply and easy to remove. They are adhesive-free and won't leave any residue. They are reverse-printed, so you can stick them on the inside of any window and they can be read from the outside.

Hi everyone! I wanted a “Bitcoin Accepted Here” static-cling vinyl sticker to put on my car (as opposed to permanent adhesive stickers). I couldn’t find anybody that sold them, so I had some made. I put up a simple website in case anybody else wants some.
The benefit over regular stickers is that static-cling stickers are easy to apply and easy to remove. They are adhesive-free and won't leave any residue. They are reverse-printed, so you can stick them on the inside of any window and they can be read from the outside.
This project is mostly for fun and a learning experience, and to help spread the Bitcoin love!
