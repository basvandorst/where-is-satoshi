Do you guys think that there is this possibility where in the near future people who are extremely rich will actually invest their funds in Bitcoin, just like they do with gold/oil or other hard commodities. This way the 1% will be Bitcoin owners and keep their Bitcoin as their sound investment and keep their premium status. The rest of the population will continue to use other Crypto as a method of payment and maybe we will live to see a time where your average paycheck arrives in Crypto.

I've heard a lot of people calling it Bitcoint. It sounds scary when you hear them saying "what is up with these coinTs?"

Michael Scott could arguably be one of the greatest faces for a character in a show where a guys is confused about everything what's happening with Bitcoin! What a legend! Threat Level Bitcoin incoming!

Governments acknowledging crypto can only bring good news for crypto, not harm. I can't really tell why people are losing their minds if they have to pay taxes while working with actual money. That way everybody's happy, it's for the best to feed your government, a lesson I learned a long time ago and always live by it. Or as someone I know used to say: "You don't play games with the government or your bladder, they will both disappoint you eventually!"
