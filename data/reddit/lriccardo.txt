If you add more money you just need to update the total investment (you can find it in the wallet tab).
You should be able to add average buy prices in your primary and secondary currency in the candlestick chart page
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:47:19
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:06:48
I am sorry for the title 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:49:06
I am really sorry about the title and yes I was a bit salty. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:07:00
Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:03:10
I am not accepting donations right now because a version with ads (and a paid version to remove them) will probably come in the future
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:30:00
You can't use this app to trade, it's just a portfolio tracker
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:26:11
No timeline but here you can find why Kucoin isn't supported yet: 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:55:28
You can add a total invested amount or average buy prices per coin to show profit loss
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:12:19
The easiest way is to use exchanges APIs, you can add them and let the app automatically sync everything
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:27:41
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:34:52
Thank you! NEO is planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:24:50
Thank you, waiting for detailed feedback!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:48:41
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:41:55
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:42:56
That's a bug, fixing it in the next update sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:33:47
Did you put your address or your Binance keys?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:49:07
Don't give up if you enjoy making it!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:44:08
You should only check "view"
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:57:26
Thanks! How could I improve it? Should I just hide it?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:48:46
You can automatically sync exchanges and track wallets
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:27:36
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:29:38
I am sorry for the title, I wasn't talking about downvotes in general.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:51:30
You can post here: 
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:45:27
Yeah, I plan to use keystore in the future to make it more secure
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:11:11
Thanks, always open to suggestions!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:41:04
You mean tracking custom token addresses or just being able to add them?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:09:38
Sorry, I wish I could change it. I deserve downvotes for this, I wasn't begging for upvotes but just being salty about getting downvoted (by bots maybe?) immediatly after posting, doesn't justify it though.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:54:33
Yeah, I added it because it seems popular enough
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:55:38
Both Binance and Cryptopia has been reported to be working, try pressing again "Sync holdings", check your permissions, try syncing your system clock. If you can't get it to work send me a PM with your User ID (Settings&gt;General)
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:10:53
Yes, except individual coins profit/loss in USD, you can only see it as a percentage right now
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:40:09
Those permission are needed only when exporting (and in the future, importing), you can leave them disabled and the app will ask for them when you try to export.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:32:20
I used Android studio
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:27:23
You can add holdings clicking on the "Wallet" tab (bottom navigation bar, second icon. You can add exchanges keys going to Settings&gt;Exchanges settings
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:42:35
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:16:08
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:27:57
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:41:49
You can export holdings as csv and json, import is coming soon!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:45:36
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:51:54
You can add them from the Wallet tab or after importing from exchanges/tracking an address
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:35:41
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:39:19
Payment info is needed, you can use their official tool to test it 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:02:09
Not yet, but I will probably make a list or something like that
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:40:27
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:34:14
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:58:32
You can enable original logos, go to Settings&gt;Customization and choose "Download logos"
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:15:57
Here's the reason why Kucoin isn't supported yet: 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:25:58
I am sorry for the title
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:25:57
No worries! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:32:36
Thank you! I am not accepting donations right now because a version with ads (and an unlocked version) will probably come in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:48:56
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:47:26
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:56:46
Nope, but use read only keys anyway!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:20:37
The app "asks" (you are free to use manual add) for exchanges API keys (read only) and wallet addresses, no way the app can steal money with these. Don't know about the upvotes though, is 85% weird?
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:15:03
Thank you, I'll send you a PM later!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:14:58
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:44:13
I'm looking into it, thanks for reporting!
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:28:25
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:41:14
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:43:44
I am sorry for the title, that's not what I meant. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:49:05
You can track your Binance balance adding your API keys (read only)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:34:06
Sure! Anyway I am not collecting user data, everything is stored on the device and I only get automatic bug/crash reports
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:40:46
It's supposed to be more of an overview tool, but you can add (average) buy prices in the candlestick chart page
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:37:52
That's right, please ignore the title it's really salty
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:36:07
The API key is general, you can add it going to Settings&gt;Exchanges settings
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:41:49
Not yet, more alerts are planned though!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:13:01
Didn't expect this. Anyway I got, as usual, few downvotes immediately after clicking "send", I am starting to think there are bots downvoting everything they find
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:10:33
If you want to track your balances on an exchange you have to use API keys not wallet addresses. The address you are using is probably a deposit address used by the exchange to get deposits (by you AND other people, that's why the balance is higher), if you don't want to add API keys or the exchange isn't supported yet you can manually add transactions from the wallet tab
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:22:43
Try copying it from etherscan url, just to make sure there isn't any special formatting
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:49:36
I deserve it, wasn't complaining about downvotes in general though. Sorry about that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:51:16
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:02:07
You should be able to add an xpub, but blockchain.info isn't supporting segwit addresses yet
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:04:54
I'll look into it, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:51:20
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it!
P.S. Play store reviews are hidden because it's a beta
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:03:38
That's planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:09:44
You mean a full list of coins (like on coinmarketcap)?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:41:34
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:23:05
Do you get the yellow bar? Are you using the same keys in other apps? If not can you send me your user id in private? You can find it in Settings&gt;General
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:26:34
Coinmarketcap, Cryptocompare and Coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:39:06
I am sorry about the title, I have nothing against that app or the author
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:59:04
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:43:24
Something like adding the contract address, currency code etc?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:36:01
That's an interesting feature, something like being able to add a contract address to track eth tokens?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:27:40
You can use the export feature and import/backup are coming soon!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:11:17
There should be just a bit of padding (too much was a problem when displaying a lot of decimals). Sorry about the title.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:56:19
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:07:35
Camera is used when importing keys using the QR scanner and storage is used when exporting data. You can disable them and the app will ask for them when they are needed
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:32:55
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:02:23
Thank you!

Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:51:28
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:01:12
Got it, looking into it!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:35:54
I'll look into adding it, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:29:27
May consider to switch then, thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:50:09
May have been a network issue or a problem with their servers then, it usually works
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:00:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:33:41
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:20:04
It's for Android only right now, sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:05:16
That's weird, I am not getting any error report and it never happened, can you PM me more details?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:49:06
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:55:37
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:06:24
You can manually add coins or add wallet addresses/exchange API keys
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:07:40
That's weird, PM'ed!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:34:32
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:42:25
Can you try pressing "Sync holdings" again? Do you get a yellow bar?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:54:23
Yep, that's planned. I want to add an import function to load exported data (balances) and a backup/restore for settings, keys, addresses etc.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:22:02
Sorry for the title :(
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:53:45
No way it can steal your money but make sure you use read-only keys!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:05:03
You can automatically import your balances using exchanges APIs (read only), track wallet addresses, read news, view portfolio charts etc.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:20:51
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:53:02
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:21:24
I agree. I would probably downvote it too, but I am just sick of trying to get noticed just to get downvoted during the first 10 secs. After I saw that post getting so much attention (nothing against that post obviously!) I just couldn't stand it anymore
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:03:46
You can add alerts, click on the three dots then on "Alerts"
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:46:51
Here you can find why Kucoin isn't supported yet: 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:08:49
Not yet, I'll look into adding it!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:59:54
Thank you! I know it's not very intuitive, I'll probably add an overlay to explain how to use it!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:00:19
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:45:38
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:44:45
Some desktop features are planned for the future
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:10:06
I'll look into it, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:49:56
Thanks for the suggestions!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:26:29
That's planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:44:41
I am using MPAndroidChart
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:38:08
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:37:26
You can change it to 7 day using the sort feature and if you are talking about line graphs you can find an option (Settings&gt;General&gt;Default values) to change them!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:36:00
Widgets are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:26:18
That's not planned right now, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:54:13
Not yet, sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:35:24
There's no address label, just click on Wallet&gt;track address and put your address there
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:08:47
Thank you, no way I can access your balance (I can't even see it)!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:44:17
I am sorry for the title
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:17:03
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:57:50
Many people asked for it, it's not planned but I am considering it. I am alone developing this app but some users offered to help so I'll try to find a way to do that
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:41:33
Thank you, widgets are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:02:59
I wasn't complaining about downvotes and I didn't expect this. It was just a rant for getting immediatly downvoted after hitting send but I now realized it may have just been bots, sorry about that
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:47:44
Thanks, if you are talking about coin logos you can enable them, Settings&gt;Customization
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:05:39
I'll look into it, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:40:31
I am sorry about the title, please ignore it
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:14:33
Did you press "Sync holdings" after adding it?
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:34:54
Not much actually
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:55:35
I was when I made this post, I apologize about that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:12:32
If you change the default currency to BTC you will get BTC charts. I am thinking about making it easier to switch though
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:47:44
That permission is used when scanning a QR (to import keys), you can leave it disabled and the app will ask for it when you try to scan a QR
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:51:56
Thank you! I worked really hard on this and receiving positive feedback is just the best feeling ever!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:40:17
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:46:53
You can automatically sync exchanges, track wallet addresses, view portfolio charts and many other features
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:47:50
Long click on an entry
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:32:09
QuadrigaCX is supported
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:07:05
Right now it's ad free but I didn't really think about monetization yet
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:17:30
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:11:33
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:58:37
You are right, other people gave the same suggestion. In the next version "BTC" will be replaced with "Currency code", would that make it better?
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:41:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:07:03
Would that be acceptable? I do not want to make people pay "twice"
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:59:12
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:57:42
Try pressing "Sync holdings" after adding it
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:21:50
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:37:15
Thank you! NEO tracking is planned
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:06:44
Got it, more alerts features are planned, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:57:07
I know, it's really bad, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:22:08
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:35:04
That's kinda planned, I am just waiting to release the first stable version before adding something like that
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:55:59
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:46:03
Oh. That's why it's showing the wrong balance. If you have your coins on Binance you should generate new API keys (read only) and add them to the app
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:13:13
I agree! I have nothing against that project!
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:42:26
Are you using the same keys in other apps? Try syncing your system clock
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:02:58
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:52:55
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:49:39
I am really sorry for the title! :(
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:38:28
What exactly doesn't work?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:17:53
You can add Garlicoin (unless you mean tracking an address)
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:47:26
Thanks for the feedback, I will look into it! Rotation should be disabled in the next update! News sources can't be added by users because for every source there is some code used to fetch articles etc. and every source is different
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:28:51
No, it's not planned right now but I will look into it for the future
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:47:00
Nope. Everything is stored on your device, no servers.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:10:22
What do you mean? It's working correctly for me
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:13:41
Thanks, some customization options are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:25:38
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:47:53
wallet:accounts:read should be enough
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:00:19
I already tried that in the past 2 months, check my post history. I always get immediately downvoted (with 0 views).
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:35:03
That's really weird because many people from the US installed it, anyone else experienced this problem?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:19:12
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:34:32
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:40:38
NEO tracking is planned!
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:54:50
Thank you! You can manually add those tokens but automatically tracking isn't supported yet for them, click on the Wallet tab and you'll be able to manually add transactions.
 I am waiting before adding Kucoin because read-only isn't supported yet (more details here: 
Didn't know about that battery issue, I'll look into it!
Thanks for the feedback! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:59:27
That's not what I meant, sorry for the title
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:56:47
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:22:45
Great, removing the "untested" label!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:57:53
I know, the title is really bad and I am sorry about that, I wasn't complaining about getting downvoted.

@_date: 2018-01-29 22:06:09
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:23:28
You are right, that's why you should always use READ ONLY keys.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:55:58
That's not what I meant, I am sorry for the title.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:26:31
That's planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:12:48
I know, the title is really bad but I wasn't talking about downvotes in general, I was talking about getting downvoted after few seconds I made the post (with 0 views, so bots maybe), this caused the post to die.

If you go to the candlestick chart page you can add buy prices in your primary and secondary currency (you can set BTC/ETH to your secondary currency) and it will be used to calculate profit/loss when switching (clicking on total in the main page)
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:55:29
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:09:33
Not yet, it's not planned but many people asked for it, so I am trying to find a way to do that
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:41:01
It's not really planned right now, but I will definitely consider it in the future, sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:24:41
Whoa, I am not manipulating anything, wouldn't I get banned by admins for this? I think they can see if upvotes are from bots or not
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:23:53
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:24:28
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:57:06
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:04:07
Here's the reason why Kucoin isn't supported yet: 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:55:38
The app doesn't support fiat tracking yet, I am working on it. As a temporary workaround you can manually add USDT
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:29:44
1) You should already be able to do that (with supported tokens), just add your address as "Ethereum" and you can choose the tokens you want to track
2) That's kinda hard to do, many exchanges have limitations or don't support this at all
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:04:36
At first I thought about something like "CryptoTracker" (yep, I am bad at naming things) but it already exists. I thought about it being fast (snap) and I got Bitsnap, then added a second "p" because it's an app ("BitsnApp").
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:02:54
Don't be. Go on and make it, every project is unique.
P.S. I know that feel.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:38:21
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:46:48
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:59:59
It's already there! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:14:03
Can you try closing and reopening the app? Are you on a stable network? Can you reach Coinmarketcap and Cryptocompare/Coinbase using your browser?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:31:29
You can add alerts, click on the three dots then on "Alerts"
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:23:11
Cryptopia has been reported to be working, are you using the same keys in other apps? Can you try pressing "Sync holdings" again?
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:39:25
Java, that's why it's only for Android at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:35:09
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:21:45
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:39:43
It's an open beta right now
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:53:44
Made me laugh, sorry about the title though.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:28:27
I plan to keep adding coins. You should be able to add an xpub 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:47:02
It's not open source, but you can try sniffing network traffic to check the requests being made
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:21:35
Thanks for the feedback and I agree, the title is really bad, I would change it if I could but it's too late.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:09:45
No emails collected and your portfolio is 100% private, no data being sent to servers. I only collect a randomly generated string used as an user ID to associate an user with automatic bug reports (to help them when something goes wrong)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:27:52
I wouldn't consider that adverts
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:46:03
You can change charts time frame, Settings&gt;General&gt;Default values.
Filtering news is kinda planned, I thought about highlighting articles talking about coins you have
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:08:28
You can add your addresses, go to the Wallet tab then click on "track address"
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:25:31
Not yet, maybe in the future, sorry
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:06:38
Some users said it's only syncing balance in the "Main account", can y ou try moving your funds from the "trading account" to the "main account"?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:05:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:09:47
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:33:25
What do you mean? I didn't downvote you
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:27:42
Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:32:22
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:08:17
I'm looking into it, thanks for reporting!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:22:48
The app supports Android 5+ because there were many problems with lower versions (especially using vectors)
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:04:44
You can use it to track your cryptocurrencies, check prices, news, charts, your total, profit/loss etc.
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:50:46
Play store should automatically update it, but sometimes it glitches and you have to close and reopen the page to see updates
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:29:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:08:56
Thank you! I know the title is really bad, but I didn't mean to call her out, I have nothing against her! It was a rant about getting instantly downvoted (by bots?) after hitting "send", sorry about that :(
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:05:23
Do you get a yellow bar?
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:52:07
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:47:09
I am sorry for the title, please ignore it
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:51:28
Thank you! Android wear is not planned right now but I'll consider it for the future!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:05:22
I agree (I am not 16), the title is really bad, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:51:29
I know, I am sorry about the title. 
You can add a pin going to Settings&gt;Advanced settings, you'll also be able to unlock the app using the fingerprint scanner
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:26:37
Yes, you can manually add transactions from the Wallet tab
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:31:55
Great suggestion! Some desktop features are planned (like adding every address from your PC then importing them with a QR), I will look into it!
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:08:19
The value is referring to your default currency, try syncing again ("Sync holdings") after changing it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:38:34
That's weird, PM'ed
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:39:53
Not Canadian but I genuinely feel sorry for "excluding" them
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:57:56
Yes, click on the three dots then on "Alerts"
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:52:35
Not at all.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:53:07
Fiat tracking is planned
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:07:43
I'll look into it, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:06:09
Thank you so much for appreciating my work!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:00:25
It's not planned right now, but many people asked for it. The problem is that I am alone developing this app (even though some people offered their help, and I will consider it) so I don't know when it will be available, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:02:47
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:39:57
I will!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:27:54
No worries! :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:39:38
Great! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:50:20
You can add Alerts, click on the three dots then on "Alerts"
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:56:38
What do you mean? You can manually add transactions, click on the Wallet tab
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:54:10
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:58:40
I plan to add some non-invasive ads with a "pro" version to remove them, not sure about adding some premium features. I didn't really think about monetization yet because it's not a priority right now.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:08:06
What do you mean they don't work? Did you press "Sync holdings" after adding them?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:48:35
You can add you addresses clicking on the Wallet tab then switching to "track address!
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:13:48
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:52:06
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:51:23
You can add an xpub key but blockchain.info isn't supporting segwit yet
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:19:30
It's not planned right now, but many people asked for it. The problem is that I am alone developing this app (even though some people offered their help, and I will consider it) so I don't know when it will be available, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:50:55
Yes, that and settings. You would have to grant a malicious app superuser permissions though
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:59:16
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:15:03
It's not really planned right now, but I will definitely consider it in the future, sorry!

Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:13:42
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:57:07
This is completely unrelated to the app. If you track that wallet address you get the correct balance (you get the same result using any XLM explorer). That address isn't a private address and it's just used when you make a deposit on your Binance account, if you want to track your Binance balance you have to use API keys (or manually add transactions)
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:13:22
I am sorry about the title
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:00:07
With plus sign you mean "add"? You probably missed some input fields
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:28:15
No, it's not planned right now but I will look into it for the future
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:51:04
It will always stay green, 100% guaranteed. /s
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:09:06
Thanks, widgets are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:16:35
That wasn't me, but please ignore the title anyway as it's very salty. If you wanted to download her app, please do and support her.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:50:32
Ok, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:11:41
You can add watch only entries, go to the Wallet tab then click on "watch only"
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:45:57
Got it, I misunderstood then!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:54:37
You can automatically sync exchanges and track wallet addresses (and many other features). Ignore the title please
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:56:30
You can add your addresses and the app will track them. The total amount invested is used to calculate your profit/loss, you can set it in your primary and secondary currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:41:35
You can already do that, go to the wallet tab then click on "track address" :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:16:54
Do you get an error or a 0 balance?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:51:25
API keys allows the app to get your balance from Binance (for every coin, not just XLM). That wallet address is used by Binance to get deposits, this means that other people can use it to deposit their XLM and that's why you get the wrong balance.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:59:08
When do you get this? If you get it when adding coins you probably didn't add a currency code
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:51:21
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:07:02
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:40:40
Didn't downvote that, I missed it. Anyway I think it's more complicated than that (
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:35:50
Thanks! I am not accepting donations right now because in the future I will probably add some ads and a paid version
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:42:57
If you set your default currency to BTC you will get altcoin/btc charts, will look for a way to make it easier though!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:26:06
Sorry for the title.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:33:17
It's planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:25:18
This app allows you to track your investments, you can't buy/mine with it
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:51:59
I am sorry about the title
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:21:49
That's kinda hard to do, because many exchanges have limitations or don't support it at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:57:22
I didn't really think about monetization yet
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:45:36
Go to Android Date &amp; Time settings and enable automatic sync (if it's already enabled, disable and re-enable it, this will force an update)
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:48:53
Thank you, best of luck with your app!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:50:41
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:07:10

And the balance is always 0?

@_date: 2018-01-29 17:34:26
I'll look into it, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:22:29
That's really weird, try waiting a bit, may be a problem with their API 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:09:15
The instant downvotes caused the post to die with 10 views and 2 upvotes on big communities like this. I don't care about upvotes, karma etc. I just wanted to have a chance to reach people.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:35:57
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:43:53
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:25:23
Should be available in the US but it's an open beta, so you may not find it unless you use the direct link
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:15:58
You can always add read-only API keys and let it sync if you don't want to manually add transactions
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:49:16
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:58:22
Thanks! Widgets are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:39:41
What you mean the QR scanner doesn't work? Are you using the same keys on other apps? Try syncing your system clock
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:05:45
Thank you! The hate is for the title, it's really bad :(
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:29:07
Are you using the same keys on other apps? If not try syncing again later, if you can't get it to work send me a PM
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:48:06
That's because Cryptocompare isn't tracking it yet ( we just have to wait!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:52:52
Thank you! I am waiting before adding Kucoin because their APIs don't support read only permissions, the should be working on it
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:06:46
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:45:18
Thank you! Best of luck with your app!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:35:42
I already checked their license, I am giving credits and the app isn't commercial
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:33:52
Can you send me your user id in private? You can find it in Settings&gt;General
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:08:24
Thank you!

@_date: 2018-01-29 18:05:13
I don't plan to make it open source sorry
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:26:07
No! Never put your private keys. The public address is enough. After syncing do you get a yellow bar? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:17:21
I used Android studio, I learned by myself. The best suggestion I can give to you is to keep making apps and don't give up, you'll always get better.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:00:39
Widgets are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:54:48
Right now you can only export, but an import feature is planned and should be coming soon!
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:52:09
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:54:50
Here's why Kucoin isn't supported yet: 
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:28:18
I'll look into it, is read-only permission supported?
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:24:07
I am waiting before adding Kucoin for security reasons (API keys don't support read only)
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:42:00
Thank you, I will!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:55:48

Widgets are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:18:58
No iOS yet, the app is built with Java. The main differences (with apps like Blockfolio and Delta) are exchanges synchronization and wallet tracking, in general, I tried to include features from many apps into a single one (news, coins graphs, portfolio charts etc.).
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:53:12
Widgets are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:19:27
It's working for me, are you sure your address is correct? You may have some spaces at the and or something like that
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:27:46
It really depends, right now it's a beta and there isn't a fixed schedule
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:52:31
I do not plan to make it open source sorry
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:59:58
I wanted to automate it but etherscan needs a contract address a single requests for every token. Also, token decimals aren't in the response
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:24:42
I am sorry for that, I wish I could change it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:41:34
You can automatically sync exchanges, track wallet addresses, view portfolio charts and many other features!

@_date: 2018-01-29 18:48:22
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:31:04
You can create one API key and add it to Bitsnapp (Settings&gt;Exchanges settings&gt;Binance) and you will be able to sync your entier portfolio
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:23:49
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:04:20
You can enable them, Settings&gt;Customization

Thank you! Do you get a yellow bar or a 0 balance for HitBTC?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:09:20
Not yet, I'll look into adding it!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:59:40
Thanks for the suggestion, will look into it!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:36:51

@_date: 2018-01-29 18:48:17
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:52:31
I suggest you use read only keys or if you don't trust the app just manually add transactions
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:17:36
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:53:54
Right now those tokens aren't supported, but you can still track your Ethereum address
NEO is planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:48:31
Nope. Everything is stored on your device, no data sent to servers.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:14:22
Thanks! Can't wait to hear your feedback :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:54:43
I am sorry about the title, that's now what I meant
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:52:27
I understand. I was just sick of getting downvotes after few secs, by people (or bots maybe) that didn't even open it, not getting downvoted in general, it's a really bad title and I'm sorry for that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:47:48
Blockchain.info doesn't support segwit addresses yet, that's why it doesn't work
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:42:30
You can click on the Wallet tab and manually add transactions, then click on "track address" and add your addresses. If you want to add API keys go to Settings&gt;Exchanges settings
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:49:01
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:37:10
Thank you! I would change it if I could

I'll look into it, thanks for the suggestion!

You can add "Watch only" entries from the "Wallet" tab, the full list is planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:00:29
Keys are stored using Android SharedPreferences and shouldn't be accessible by other apps (unless your phone is rooted). Anyway more security features are planned.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:41:57
I know, I am sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:57:39
May be a permission error, did you set  "Order book, History, Trading  balance" and "Payment information" permissions?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:15:28
Thanks! You can already do that, "Settings&gt;Import/Export&gt;CSV"
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:46:23
You can already manually add transactions, click on the Wallet tab
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:04:14
It really depends on which app you are talking about, I tried to include many features in a single app.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:16:33
What happens? Do you get a yellow bar?
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:10:38
Thank you, sorry for the bad title!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:37:54
Not yet, will definitely consider it in the future, sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:55:52
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:46:25
You should click on "API settings" then create new API keys, check only "read info"
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:21:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:49:22
That's weird, can you send me a PM with your user id? I can't find the crash report
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:42:07
I am sorry for the title.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:39:10
You can use this app to track your crypto portfolio. You can add exchanges API keys/wallet address and the app will automatically sync everything
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:50:35
1. This permission is used when exporting/importing (you can leave it disabled and the app will ask for it)
2. This permission is used for alerts and similar features coming in the future
3. This permission is used to scan QR codes (you can leave it disabled and the app will ask for it)
4. This permission is used when you set a PIN to lock the app, you will be able to unlock it using your fingerprint
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:09:31
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:22:58
I'll look into it, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:06:22
It's used for alerts and in the future will be used to track historical data about your portfolio
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:55:04
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:18:25
I agree, would adding some default coins to the "watch only" list be enough?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:09:34
I am sorry for the title, that's not what I meant
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:48:33
There's no way the app can access an user's balance, and for security reasons you should always use read-only keys.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:19:50
Yep, click on the wallet tab then on the "bag of money" icon. You can also add average buy prices per coin in the chandlestick pages (click on a coin from the main list)
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:50:23
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:07:10
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:36:22
I'll look into it! Watch only should have 0 as amount?
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:47:32
It's not really planned right now but many people asked for it so I am trying to find a way to do that
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:33:39
I am sorry about the title
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:05:16
If you want you can click on the Wallet tab and manually add your balances, no need to add the addresses, you'll just need to keep it updated
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:03:31
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:01:00
You are correct, right now fiat isn't tracked but it's planned!
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:07:22
Thank you! Can you PM me your User ID?
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:37:25
Thank you, I will!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:06:25
Right now it's free (without ads) because it's a beta, in the future I'll probably add some ads (non-invasive) and a paid version to remove them. Anyway, the app is serverless, I have no way to see users balance and I only receive automatic error/crash reports.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:02:51
Coinmarketcap, Cryptocompare and Coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:55:13
I'll look into adding it as soon as possible
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:40:52
The main differences are automatic exchanges sync and wallet tracking
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:00:33
If you want to track an address (a Bitcoin address for example) you can add it there
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:22:35
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:49:01
Widgets are planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:06:10
What happens?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:17:19
I am working on this!
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:31:36
Thanks for the suggestion, multiple portfolio is tricky to add with exchanges/address sync
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:13:42
Not transactions but you can add an average buy price per coin in the chandlestick chart page
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:10:02
Not yet, it's not planned but many people asked for it, so I am trying to find a way to do that
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:59:47
Not yet, I'll look into adding it!
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:22:23
I plan to add ads and a paid version after releasing a stable version
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:27:15
That wasn't me, sorry for the bad title
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:10:51
I am sorry about the title
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:00:47
Not yet but it's planned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:33:44
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:00:55
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:49:23
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:50:04
Well, I am young but not *that* young.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:28:19
What happens? Do you get the yellow bar? Did you press "Sync holdings" after adding them?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:35:35
Not yet, will definitely consider it in the future, sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:08:06
I am using blockchain.info to track bitcoin addresses
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:55:40
Sorry for the rant but it's getting ridiculous.
Edit: really? Downvoted after 5 secs?
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:45:56
Thanks for the suggestion! Does it support read-only API keys?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:53:59
Got it, you can't add purchase dates but a feature to track historical portfolio is planned (but the app wouldn't be able to track your balance before you installed it) 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:44:09
Try pressing "Sync holdings"
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:25:30
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:13:03
Dragging should be fixed in the next update
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:33:31
Right now you can set a secondary currency that will be used when you click on the total (top bar) to convert values
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:09:22
Graphs are from cryptocompare, it's probably because isn't tracked yet... Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:10:21
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:51:11
Thank you! I am thinking about just adding "All"
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:48:37
From the main list you can click on coins to get more details, you can view candlestick charts and market cap/supply, change % 1h/24h/7d and add average buy prices. You can change % change using the sort option (a bit tricky, I know).
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:49:57
You can sort the asset list, click on the three dots (top right) then on "Sort"
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:49:54
Should be fixed in the next update!
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:08:58
1. Not sure what you mean
2. Not yet but I am working on a feature that periodically saves your portfolio data to plot historical charts
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:46:22
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:04:04
Yeah, the first time using it isn't very intuitive. At first the list is empty, you can manually add transactions (or watch only entries) clicking on the Wallet tab, or let the app automatically sync your exchanges/wallet addresses (adding API keys/addresses)
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:20:31
Here's the play store link: 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:35:50
Great! :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:02:13
Check out the latest update, I added NiceHash and other mining pools
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:15:30
Yep, in the next update instead of "BTC" it will say "Select a currency code"
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:57:27
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:05:03
More sort options are coming, thanks for the suggestion! :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:52:48
Mining pools API are planned!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:15:45
You mean a page to convert between coins/fiat?
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:40:49
Yeah, that was me. Not sure why this was reposted
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:40:15
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:06:16
Camera permission is used to scan QR codes, you can keep it disabled and the app will ask you to enable it when you try to scan a QR.
EDIT: I don't get the downvotes, you can keep the camera permission disabled and when you try to scan a QR code to import API keys (and addresses in the future) the app will ask you to enable that permission 
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:05:36
I am the app developer, I'll answer to your questions but I am not sure why this was posted or who is.
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:09:23
Thank you!
You can enable other subreddits by clicking on the bottom right button.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:49:05
There were many problems with Android 4.x, but it may be added in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:53:35
Thanks for the feedback!
Where did "your crypto assets in one spot" come from?
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:08:34
Thank you!
I am not sure about the monetization model as it's not the main priority. In the future I may add a pro version with some extra features or few ads with a paid version to remove them.
