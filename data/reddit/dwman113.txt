Is this the segwit that is reallocating Satoshi Nakamoto coins?

It seems like keeping this threat up is actually the FUD as the original post was indeed factual.

This makes sense, and if the deposit was large enough to actaully warrant returning it to the earth, it would be in such quantities that gold would become cheap. 
That said, what metals WOULD potentially be worth extracting and returning to earth? And which are the most likely to be profitable first? Magnets? Lithium?

What is the intrinsic property of platinum that makes it specifically valuable?

When you investigate those links almost all of them come up completely opposite of your statements :(

The US dollar is backed by gold. It's just fractionally reserved.
You're question is set up to be incorrect either way you slice it.

Actually now that CW is out of the mix. Bcash is actually not that bad.

So you hate Bitcoin Cash but you have no idea what the facts are? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:48:30
Yep. Most likely will.

I guess he is either the troll. Or a sheep....
@_date: 2019-05-29 00:49:46
The point is the lie. Slushpool prioritized this transaction just to make Roger look wrong. When in fact he was correct.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:47:26
What? caring about bitcoin and how it works LOL? In the bitcoin subreddit.... I think you might literally be crazy.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:05:13
Who is saying Roger is trustworthy? In fact if anything I am trying to prove Roger wrong. However when I started looking into the facts. It appears Roger was correct and at the least Slushpool did some shenanigans.

So you think if you sent 1 sat, it would clear like Tones did?
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:22:36
At 5/24 23:47 when that block was mined there were still 13k+ pending transactions paying more than 3 sat/byte.
Also transactions at that fee level hadn't cleared in almost 24 hours.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:46:58
Seems to be the reality.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:04:21
It does not. I already included time stamps in previous posts. You can see when the transaction cleared well before it should have.
@_date: 2019-05-29 00:50:59
You said it was not the highest priority. Do you recant that statement as false now? 
So tired of people and their ignorance or lies because they have some agenda.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:46:06
Roger Tweeted a video about it. It clearly was highest priority. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:46:46
How am I a troll? This is a valid question. I am genuinely curious. Learning is good not bad...
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:23:15
You're a troll. Go back under the bridge. I'm asking a legitimate question.
@_date: 2019-05-29 00:48:15
Pool manipulation make you feel better? The point is, the whole situation was manipulated.
I don't give a fuck about Roger or Bitcoin Cash. I hold lots of coins including bitcoins from 2012. 
The point is. This was not something a normal person could do.
