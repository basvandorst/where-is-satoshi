yep sent a request, they got back to me within 24hrs and cancelled the transaction. i think i was lucky with the time though, prob usually takes longer. pm if you need any extra help

i agree that its good to be skeptical, i think protecting people comes far before economic and political interests though, thats all

my bad, i posted the wrong address. that was the address of the coinspot wallet (where i sent it *from*). the actual address is

lol im in aus, its 4:30pm. coinspot is an australian exchange (i think) :). i definitely wouldnt have put in a wrong address, it was either the correct one, or possibly blank. its only been an hour, just the fact that the address field is blank and the transaction ID field empty makes me a bit nervous. btw, if you have a litecoin address, pm it to me. if this ends up coming through then ill send you some $$ via ltc as a thanks for your help!

yeah i only sent it one hour ago. if i did happen to leave the address blank will it bounce back, or likely gone forever?

do you foresee a 'price correction' at 10k that others here have been talking about? ppl selling off at once b/c it reaches the certain goal that they might've had for themselves?
