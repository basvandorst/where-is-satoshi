Iirc, it was too ambitious to accomplish at the time and they plan on trying again in a year or so.

In the case of tech company acquisition, you have to factor in the value of the userbase and the lost opportunity from letting the competition buy it, rather than the value of the product itself. It's pretty fascinating to watch.

Tesla isn't missing. It was removed from the filter in the past two weeks or so after community outcry.

It was $0.60, man.

Don't worry, I already looked into it. It's legit, TorrentFreak confirmed it's the same guys from the original site. Everything down to my old ratio is in tact, too. The tracker is back up, too, but almost every torrent is down to like one seeder now.

Unless you're using a badly designed laptop or on a foreign layout, it *should* be next to the 1 key.

That's kinda fascinating. Do you have any sources for that? Wikipedia isn't saying anything about an artifical American backlash, just that it's a combination of the punk movement and a lot of alleged homophobia and racism.

I did the math when deciding if GPU mining was worth it a while ago. A $900 gaming PC on medium-high load is typically around 400W. Over the period of a month of 24/7, that's 288kWh. The average price of electricity in the States is $0.12/kWh. At ~$35/month, I hope the wear on your GPU is worth it.

You linked to the exact page OP linked to.

I'm just here to observe as well. While I'm pulling for cryptocurrency to succeed, I always love the times where bad news happens (SR takedown, everything Mt. Gox) and everybody tries to flip it as "This is actually good news!" in hopes it makes people throw more money at it...and it kinda works.

It's my favorite Bitcoin phrase next to "This is actually good news".

Isn't that inevitable? The Tor Project is a decentralized web protocol, but their website has ties with Mozilla for their browser bundle.

That joke is older than the ARPANET.

I was actually infected with one, albeit a failed one. It tries to launch when idle for more than 5 minutes, then my GPU usage shoots up for about 3 seconds and I get a "lsidxnnwqdo.exe is not responding" message. Looking at Windows Event logs, it looks like the program stopped because Windows noticed it was attempting to access my memory illegally. If you locate and open said exe in a command prompt window before it deletes itself, it's actually a copy of bfgminer 3.2 and asks for user credentials. If anybody wants screenshots or anything, I still have it locked away.
EDIT: Worth noting that I'm on Windows 8 x64 and I rarely torrent anything other than the latest Breaking Bad or a movie you can't get on Netflix, so I have no idea how it appeared.
