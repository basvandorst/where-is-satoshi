A huge bitcoin would still be pretty literal. I would expect something more abstract from artwork. Something representational.

It’s a little on the nose.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:52:51
It’s not down that much.
@_date: 2019-10-27 14:36:34
Oh stop it already.

Seems like sending a bank robber away with marked bill. Easily traceable.

I’d move those bitcoin winnings into Litecoin while the price rebounds like you know it will.

You’re  right that bitcoin broke the monopoly on finance. 
A few days ago I bought ten dollars worth of bitcoin and I just traded it for a brand new $500,000 house. Thanks bitcoin!

How do you buy this?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:09:22
That’s Litecoin

The jump from 1 to 10 is the same as 1000 -10,000?

She wouldn’t be single if republicans supported American job growth instead of shipping jobs away and actually passed laws that would inhibit billionaires from hoarding money and instead pay taxes that would enrich the economy.

Pretty funny
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:50:56
I wish I had this
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:28:28
What do you don in these places?
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:06:20
Statistically this will continue to happen and eventually there will only be one bitcoin left. Only half joking.

I mean, gold didn’t work for a reason.

If the fed has to do this to keep the economy working - how would the fed keep the economy working if bitcoin replaced fiat. 
If they need to print money and they can’t print money how are they going to keep everything from going to shit.

You also can’t get a bridge loan, business loan, or home loan, or car loan.
@_date: 2019-09-05 04:11:51
Which bitcoin. I hope I have the right one.

Fine - you tube was founded 14 years ago. Not ten. Jesus fucking Christ reddit kids. Found the dick wads.four fucking years and people shit their pants.
@_date: 2019-09-28 03:29:42
Ten years ago when you were 15 and you tube wasn’t around yet?
@_date: 2019-09-28 03:44:46
Oh buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurn
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:47:54
But where do you get the money to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:34:15
Tax write off. 
Meet women. 
Go to premier parties like Sundance. 
Turn bitcoin into investment that makes money. 
It’s a win win win. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:13:23
2 million
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:49:03
Isn’t that how you make normal
Money too?
