That phrase is actually used to stop people causing bubbles when they see it going 'to da moon' and try to jump in as well - panic buying.

I wonder what the regulatory standards are for something like this, as you're basically looking for a company similar to PayPal, in that it's a payment processor for fiat currencies, but the fiat then becomes converted to BTC via an exchange.

Fair enough. From what I gather though China is one big shade of grey, and you may be asking for something which isn't expressed clearly, more so hinted at, which is enough most of the time from what I can gather. I'm no expert though, just my opinion - although you seem to be hoping people here are lol

Just wondering if this might be a source you're after:
quote is "Lee says that BTC-China isn’t going the direct payment route because they would first need to be licensed as a payment processor to receive and pay out money from BTC-China’s corporate bank account."

You forget that those coins had to initially be bought.

Please note that i did not down vote you, but I expect many in this subreddit will.
Would you care to comment on the value of bitcoin as a method of payment / transfer protocol and the ability to decentralise such a system, rather than on bitcoin as a virtual currency used to pay for goods? I'd like to hear what you can say to tarnish its uses there rather than as a speculative currency which alot of people easily fall back on to try and throw shit on it as a whole.
EDIT: Just to elaborate - I make speculative investments in bitcoin the currency, because I see the value it brings as bitcoin the decentralised transfer protocol, and my belief that it will be a more widely used system in the coming years, I think that right now the overall value of the limited 'tokens' which will be used within the system is very undervalued. I don't put a value on the currency itself, rather I think that the utility of the bitcoin transfer protocol will see increased use, and with that the value of the limited 'transfer tokens' or 'bitcoins' the currency which need to be used to send money across will also rise.

Please direct me to an alternative exchange offering 0.2% trading fees, and I'd be happy to switch. Until then, I have not had any issues with BTC-e personally which would cause me to wish to switch.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:17:30
That's because it is extremely undervalued and still in the early phase of adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:15:48
Umm actually no, as each coin isn't always going to be 1 BTC. Some represent 10 BTC or 0.5 BTC, etc etc. Thus the "in various denominations" part. Minting 90,000 BTC worth of coins doesn't mean he minted 90,000 physical casascius coins.

Yo dawg. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:30:10
That's because people still try to apply usual standards to it. It will take some time before a proper and widespread shift of mindset will occur and people will understand this point.

So far the only reason for bitcoin to be ontop is because it has first mover advantage. As for the quote, you do realise that is what the definition of value is - a bunch of people wanting the same scarce thing. Why do you think bitcoin is rising in price? Because other suckers are also buying it. Do you actually see a reason to own pieces of paper with numbers on them we call fiat currency besides the fact that other people will give you things you need and want in exchange for them? The only difference here though is the flaw in its scarcity, as many are coming to see that endlessly printing money devalues it and removes the very reason for their value, outside if being backed by dudes with guns.

Except you could pick up even more coins from crashes like this... so holding is sort of failing to capitalise on those with trigger happy fingers.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:14:33
Followed by crazy cashing out because the utility of it does not yet support the evaluation.

Can you just start a blog where you tell everyone what it is that you're planning on doing, and then we can all just do the opposite and make money like that? Kthx.

In any market you will always have alternatives for consumers to feel like they have a choice. Whether that's truly necessary is irrelevant. Why do we need more than one bank / credit card?
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:57:27
Except that bitcoin is as much a payment method and way of transacting online as it is a currency, and in that sense there are competitors such as paypal / credit card companies. In that sense litecoin has key differences which may be more appealing to certain businesses. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:09:59
Is this similar to colored coins?
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:03:37
I disagree with your comparison that both currencies are identical. That's like saying yen and euros are the same because they're printed on paper. As for features being adopted from other popular currencies, that may very well happen, but it shows that there are key differences between currencies out there that would warrant their use and increased popularity. I would argue that since it would be extremely ease to integrate litecoin into existing merchant systems such as bit pay, there is no dicinsentive for offering them as options along side bitcoin. Then it's up to consumers which currency they use and prefer, and that feeds back to my original point of consumers enjoying the feeling of choice and atleast one sizeable alternative can be expected. Whether that is litecoin or not no one can really say.
