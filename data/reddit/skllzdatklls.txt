I've never understood why when someone is 16, they tell the fucking world. I don't start everything with "I'm 69 and you wouldn't believe the shit I did this year". But the thing is, it'll just keep happening for the rest of time so whatever. Just smile.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:45:52
well done
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:19:14
the thing is, you can literally produce an argument for anything, and circumstantially/ultimately, beginning shit with "im 16" is retarded. but so are 16 year olds and so i was i when i was 16.

This just in. BREAKING NEWS. Idiot forecaster too retarded to make it in real world finance for obvious reasons has to rely on news show to bankroll his future.

nothing you mentioned unfortunately takes as much brain power as quality work. sex is pretty easy. climbing/traveling/hiking/playing guitar is honestly all fairly low IQ stuff. its fine, i have nothing against it and i do that stuff, but its not very engaging to me mentally. i dont really play computer games that much at all i just made an oversimplified statement. having $1k and turning that into $100k takes serious effort. having $100k and going to 1m and to 10m and so on takes a serious understanding and shift in perspective each time. i think that's cool. to each their own i guess.

most people simply arent smart enough to fix their own situation. those that understand finance and how to leverage those situations i feel can free themselves. just the way numbers work, there will always be many people that lose. 8-9 years ago i had roughly $0. even prior to bitcoin gains i was well on my way to becoming a millionaire anyway. and i'm virtually positive i could do it again in under 10 years with no help from friends, $1000, living in most any place around the world except the worst of the worst and only a backpack of vitals.

@_date: 2017-12-12 10:03:25
None of this is accurate.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:38:50
That is retarded. Iota is just one example of a proof of concept how that isn't necessary should technology develop to a point where it can scale appropriately. The transaction cost simply being the cost to confirm two other transactions. Sure that isn't "free" but its good enough and better than whatever retard case you're proposing and presently exists.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:04:31
I use segwit when possible but it's just not a very helpful solution in the near term and the near term does matter. Larger blocks will also help scale secondary solutions better down the road.

No one has ever answered this question despite me asking it to many people; if I put in a LN hub and a bank like Wells Fargo puts up a LN hub, do they receive equal amounts of traffic no matter what, similar to masternodes on say Dash? Or are they user dependent?

i wanted to quit working once i became "rich" but then what exactly are you going to do with all of your time? working is a great form of mental stimulation and what i consider the ultimate game/challenge. sitting around playing video games for the next 50 years isn't exactly what i would consider glamorous.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:34:10
The fewer use cases bitcoin has, the lower its underlying value is. Increasing scalability in the short run has real value. Something should be done, including a small block size increase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:05:33
"The real issue is that the solution isn't to just up the blocksize whenever the pool fills up. It's a bandaid on a broken bone, it doesn't fix the issue."
Those things matter though, that is just your opinion that you write as fact. Here are facts: it does fix the issue temporarily, it multiplies with other scaling solutions, and its present usability matters, at little cost if there were consensus.

which part do you not get, the part that makes sense? also, what makes more sense from a helping the world pragmatic standpoint, volunteering my time at what equates to a shitty hourly or productive working, generating a huge hourly and donating it to worthwhile causes down the road when im old and gray?
there are many people in shitty situations, for a variety of reasons. frequently the root cause can partially be blamed on bad circumstances but its also the combination of bad choices day in day out. most people dont even recognize these bad choices.

behind bitcoin is the world's biggest supercomputing network by a landslide and a network that people have trust/confidence in. its not nothing, he's oversimplifying/partially retarded. even giving the dunce the most generous assumption about growth, he's ignoring the fact you can invest bitcoin in various ways to grow your bitcoin holdings (crowd funded casinos, margin lending, etc).

this is $16 in your uber account. you cant use your uber account to buy coffee. wtf?
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:23:12
deposit btc onto the uber app, it can then give you an expected max range of delivery. if your uber btc wallet empties while you are underway, you can use a cc backup to continue going or just get expelled from the car.
uber then just takes the btc at this moment and fiat converts with bitpay or whatevs.
edit - a cool possibility here i just thought of is that if your friend is stranded w/o help you could send btc directly to their newly created uber wallet and they could then fund a ride out.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:27:46

@_date: 2015-03-05 04:18:37
pretty fair analysis. the cool thing is that all of the problems can be fixed with bitcoin whereas they can't for a lot of the other payment options. that will just take a fuckload of time to accomplish, unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-10-06 11:18:48
it does connect with coinbase tho im not sure to what extent. still, purse.io has convinced about 10 muggles i know to use bitcoin, no other bitcoin app comes even close. saving 25% off already cheap everything in the world is no joke.

literally asking for terms betting against the guy doing bitcoin. lol.
@_date: 2015-03-15 05:55:05
depends how they build it but if it was decentralized in a fashion somewhat resembling btc then there is no reason why it wouldn't be. however if they had the power to confiscate/remove/add or any power beyond normalized control then no, it isnt possible.
as in, wait and see.
