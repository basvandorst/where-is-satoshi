No I borrow the altcoin so I’m long.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:36:01
You act like I don’t own bitcoins and respect the the cryptocurrency.  The fact of the matter is bitcoiners tend to know more  then altcoiners.  Why are you so bent out of shape that I asked I this group for help?  You seriously have issues.  I suggest a therapist.  And for your information over a dozen guys messaged me offering to help.  Do the world a favor snd get off the net.  Trollers only waste peoples time.

You’re simply a follower.  You couldn’t explain bitcoin or the blockchain. You’re just a follower and  wannabe .

I only ask because I’ve heard of competitors doing it.  Security is not my forte.  Do you care to share why it doesn’t work?  I’d be grateful for your time.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:02:40
How exactly did you try to help?
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:38:15
Are you always so  negative?
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:07:09
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:41:04
You don’t have a solution.  You’re transparent as fuck.  Smh
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:46:16
That’s what I do now  and it’s a bitch 
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:09:42
Rich. Coming from the kid with the severe mental problems. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:43:56
Reading your past posts is hilarious.  You’re clearly looking for attention and your stupid  abilities aren’t even relevant.  Go outside, workout and enjoy life instead of hating.

Everyone loves a grammar Nazis.  Dont judge me based on autocorrect and my lack of proofreading.  Freud would say you’re bitter for a reason.  Perhaps it’s because you are nowhere near where you expected to be in life at this point.  Don’t worry.  You’ll be on basic income soon and you can correct everyone.

Rich coming from the coward talking shit behind his computer.  Do the world a favor and find a thread arguing why  bitcoin is an asset.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:15:47
Enlighten me, oh wise one.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:03:59
This is 1992 of the internet.  We are nowhere near a top, but we will see crazy volatility on our way up.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:14:38
How can I lower it?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:49:20
Except for the fact I’m one of 300 blockchain employees at JP Morgan,  
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:54:44
Not really.  All of Wall Street is is embracing blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:38:10
Except for the fact that every bank has embraced blockchain.   Fake news.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:32:57
I think you need to learn the difference between bitcoin and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:36:21
A bunch of fan boys who no shit about bitcoin. Sounds about right for Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:15:04
Makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:16:42
You little bitch. Bitcoin is blockchain, while bitcoin is the currency for the  blockchain. Every bank is working on their own blockchain you stupid inbred.  Do you understand now or should we have dinner at your tent and I can explain further?
