What's the likelihood that Mark will be able to pay restitution given that Japanese prosecutors have a 99% conviction rate?

I was one of those people except I didn't go to science fiction conventions. I've learned that ego is *very fucking expensive*. It also prevented me from making the right decisions and was costly. I thought I was great at programming so obviously business is easy. WRONG. Took a long time before I realize I had to take it seriously just like programming. If I didn't have such a huge ego built around that one skill, I would've figured things out faster. It was when I decided I would make continuous effort to never let my ego get in the way of doing the right thing that I noticed improvements. Now it's a lot better and I'm so much happier. I ask myself everyday what else is my ego preventing me from achieving? Would the old me do this thing? Then I do the complete fucking opposite and always work hard to question if there's any ego at play. I'm policing my own ego (I mean what the fuck is it that is so valuable that I've let it make horrible decisions?) because it's an expense I don't need anymore. A year ago I would not even have written this. Good on you man for writing that observation.

is this autistic thinking? I'm curious because there almost seems like an inability to have insight into the situation or even put onself in other people's shoes. Either that or extreme narcissism and ego at play here.
