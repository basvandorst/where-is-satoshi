Yes, because that's the status quo after the hard fork.

gmaxwell (in IRC:


So in each block there would be a field, initially set to 2 MByte. A miner is free to set any value (up to 2x the current limit).
Assuming we have the following values set in the last 12.000 blocks:
 * 20% 2 MByte
 * 20% 3 MByte
 * 60% 4 MByte
Then, because only 60% want 4 MByte but 80% agree to have 3 MByte, the limit is increased to 3 MByte.

@_date: 2014-11-13 16:42:33
That might work - but that does not solve the problem of another redditor needing a Bitcoin address :)
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:08:56
Yes, but the LN fees are very low. Don't disregard the risk of having a hot wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:06:30
I think you're confusing this with something else. If we're talking about the same person, he earned this amount because people opened channels with his node and provided funds for him without demanding anything in return. This is not related to fees, though.

That site seems to offer a lot, can you point me to the historical data? How can I find out how much 1 BTC was worth on March 2nd 2013?
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:04:31
I'll just respond to your question, the rest should be discussed elsewhere.
On my node I use the defaults. For each forwarded transaction, a fee of 1 Satoshi is required, no matter which amount is transacted. In addition a fee of a millionth of a Satoshi is required for each Satoshi forwarded in that transaction. If my math is correct, with current prices you'd need to forward 14268 transactions each worth 1€ to earn 1€ in fees (and 12644 transactions each worth 10€ to earn 1€).
Furthermore, the funder of a channel pays the fees (usually, there are exceptions) of on-chain settlement. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:50:08
"units" maybe
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:12:39
It was never mentioned, so I'd say no. Maybe there are extra fees for credit cards though?

Quick facts: no fee for everything up to 50€, fees ranging from 0.50€ to 3€, there are many alternative forms of payment (not Bitcoin) without fees

What was the dumbest thing you witnessed or at least heard about in this context?
@_date: 2015-05-07 13:45:32
I think Bitcoin allows for so many new ideas and helps achieving old goals that it is hard to pick "the goal". Just have a look at all the start ups. Some want faster confirmations. Some want mass adoption. Some want non-volatility. Some want a framework to build on.
Similarly, users and miners have different goals. Without Bitcoin none of these goals would be possible, but even with Bitcoin it is not possible to achieve all of them. Who decides where to go?
Is creating one hard fork for every choice the way to go, giving the miners and users the chance to pick "the perfect Bitcoin"? Or would that mean certain death for all possible variants of Bitcoin, because there is no "one Bitcoin" anymore?
@_date: 2014-10-11 21:52:23
Imagine movie streams being bought with Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:58:08
That does not really help, as only one person would have access to 100% of the amount. We'd need "multisig changetip".
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:20:13
Multi-Signature addresses should solve this issue. While they are not usable, yet, in the not too far future you could tell your friend to install some proper client on his phone, his laptop, his computer, his mom's computer, and on whatever device he can find. Then setup a multisig address, transfer a fortune to it. Any thief then must gain access to more than one of such machines, which should be hard enough to trust this solution. And, of course, several of these "machines" could also be a piece of paper.

Based on my chat with him, the blockchain.info wallet was the better option compared to an unsecured Bitcoin Core wallet (no passphrase, not on a "secure computer" (whatever that is), maybe not even any backup). There are better options, sure, but sometimes a "OKish" option beats a bad option.

Maybe it's just luck, and the chart is based on the number of found blocks? My nodes sent me a warning that many blocks were found.
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:09:20
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:05:49
It means: "the most recent block I already downloaded is x years old", or in other words "I still need to download x years worth of blocks". You can jump as the blocks of 2009-2014 can be downloaded just as you can download the Playboy archive from 2009-2014. There's no need to wait for a new block (which still needs to be found by some miner).
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:35:44
I also run a node with 10 GBit/sec, so I'd say I still contribute more than I take.

Nothing too fancy, I guess most of the "work" was keeping him (her?) calm and work in tiny steps. As described, the transaction went to an address generated by Bitcoin Core. The wallet was unencrypted (no passphrase) and the Blockchain was not synchronized. I confirmed the status (got the public address), then made him dump the private key in the console. Then he imported it in his blockchain.info wallet (making sure he trusts that wallet), and swept the address. In between we had a bit of a discussion what it all means, and I explained some basics.
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:30:32
That's a bug, then. I've never seen something like that.

How did you do that? I run a server with plenty of power and several GBit/sec of redundant connectivity. There is a list floating around mentioning stable nodes, it's somewhere in the top.
yet, just checked: 76 connections.

You already got a lot of hints - more than I am able to read right now. So here's my tl;dr:
Lawyer up. Spend wisely. Donate.
In fact, donating money you'll never need might be the best, as this is a good way to feel happy. There's a lot of research in how to donate, why one should donate, etc, and assuming you're at least a bit into 'overthinking' stuff I'd be happy to provide more details.
