This data shows he is sending a hundred times more data than just plain transactions + blocks. So he is basically running a server from home. If this was the bandwidth requirement for full clients then that would be worrisome in terms of overhead.

You admit that if we need &gt; 1.6Mb blocks a hardfork is technically the best. Thanks! 
At least now we know even you agree this is not merely a technical issue.

Well did anyone ask for both blocks **and** transactions to get bigger? And would increasing transaction-size even with the fix in Segregated Witness be enough to want to allow full 2Mb transactions (for instance)? 
I think no one asked for 2Mb transactions, so it's a weird reason not to upgrade the limit. Although if there is more to it than that, i'm happy to listen.

It is not necessarily true that we need $10,000 or $5,000 per block worth of security. We have that, doesn't mean we need it. 
Bitcoin's value can increase 2x every 4 years and we would already be golden. Although that can't be sustainable forever, at least that could work for the next 8-12 years. 
If Moore and Nielsen's law are on our side for the next years to come then we can increase transactions volume comfortably even without off-chain solutions, and without affecting decentralisation. 
I would not worry about it.

What exactly did I say which was wrong?
