I'm from NH...  to answer your question... Education in NH, for the most part, is not funded at state level.  Property tax money stays within each town to fund its school (there are some exceptions).  We don't have any income or sales tax, so schools are almost completely funded at town level.  Thanks to "the Claremont decision" and our idiot former governor Jeanne Shaheen some poorer towns receive a little state aid.  Both parties have tried to restructure (and even eliminate) the state aid, but it hasn't happened in the past 15 years following the ruling.  My point is that without completely turning our schools into state-run cookie cutter institutions, like your state, the NH governor has minimal say in how towns fund or don't fund their schools.
As for Healthcare, NH doesn't have the same fiscal issues as NYS.  There is talk about restructuring state gov't workers' healthcare plans, which could result in savings.  This also isn't extremely dire, compared to NYS, since NH has one of the smallest bureaucracies in the country.  NH has exploited every loophole in the book to keep medicaid funding to the lowest per capita in the country.  Health and human services could be made more efficient.  The only relatively big issue facing the NH state government right now is the unfunded liability of the state pension fund, but it can be fixed. For the most part people are usually quite happy how efficient the NH government is.

CampBX is excellent and American! (but they have a $1000/day transfer limit for "unverified" accounts).  I've never actually used Mt Gox.

I haven't tried bitfloor, but didn't they just have a big security breach? I've been using Campbx and Dwolla(for ultra cheap USD transfer).  CBX also now has 2-factor identification and has a much lower (.55%) commission fees than Bitfloor (4%, yikes).  The only downside to CBX + Dwolla is the transfers take 3-4 days and you need to have a Dwolla account older than 30 days.

CampBX + Dwolla transfer works well for me!  I agree that 4% LocalTill is too much, when others are cheaper.
