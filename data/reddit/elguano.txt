Other than the big block hypocrisy, I have little issue with miners doing this. It's decentralized, right? They can decide what to put in their blocks. Miners can decide whether to 
The issue is if mining is ever centralized; as I understand it, a controlling mining bloc could then effectively orphan any blocks that don't meet their "internal policies," so they could de facto enforce arbitrary fee minimums.

Yes probably long enough to be difficult to attack, but something that long is also going to be harder than you expect to memorize, which is the original point of the brain wallet. In a year, are you going to be able to remember you start some sentences with "Add here" and some without? Or all of the elements and which order you use? I would test this by trying to write out the entire phrase you just told me as a reply to this thread (without referring to it first), and see if you get it exactly right (cause it needs to be exact).
Also, in addition to you remembering, how will you record and pass on a brain wallet in the event that you die? Nobody else is going to remember a paragraph of phrases except for you, so you'll need to write the whole thing down or print it, keep it in a secure location, let people know what it is, or define the key from it and store that...
At some point it is probably a lot easier to generate a 24 word seed that is proven mathematically to be secure, and use that for a wallet.

@_date: 2018-01-15 21:41:10
So, that could work, but it's a lot of redundancy that probably isn't needed. And if your phrase hint (the whole paragraph) was compromised, it wouldn't be too hard to attack. I'm not even thinking brute force, though that would also be trivial.
Your gf, the casino, your pet, and first school can probably be easily scraped from your historical social media postings, or socially-engineered from friends and family. And the final name can be easily dictionary-attacked from a name list.
So in the end, you'd have to protect the entire phrase as carefully as if you just used a 24-word BIP39 seed + 25th word passphrase. In which case, why not use the thing that is supported by secure hw wallets and easily recoverable if needed?

Thanks for that detailed response, sounds like you have your house in order and these are some good suggestions I'll look into. 
I'm pretty much wedded to my wife :) so I'm not afraid if she has access to the seed words (e.g., a joint safe deposit box), other than the obvious "the more people who know, the more vectors of attack exist."
You make a good point about border control. Having traveled recently, I honestly wondered what would happen if customs or border security tried to make me give them my PIN or confiscate the device. That is probably the single more realistic risk of the device falling into the hands of a credible attacker, and if it happened, I think I would probably get a new hw wallet and immediately transfer everything to a new seed.

You might have great physical security on a wad of cash you carry around, but I think it's better not to flaunt it in the first place.
If you carry your HW wallet with you, I'd rather that fewer people see it, and if they do, fewer of those recognize it as an obvious crypto wallet.  But that's just me.

My point being, why do you think that only full-node runners should have standing to complain about fees? If bitcoin is really going to achieve ubiquitous mainstream usage in commerce, it needs buy-in from more than just the elite/wealthy/dedicated/choir, and fees/channel structure (whether easy or difficult) likewise impacts EVERYONE in the ecosystem, not just full-noders.

I think there is a lot of confusion because of details such as coffee shop examples saying the shops channel is 0btc because they don't give refunds.
1. If I open 1btc in a lightning channel, does that mean I cannot receive any more funds to that channel because the balance would be &gt;1? The limit I can send or receive is the limit of my channel, right?
2. How is counterparty ante considered? Can I front zero BTC to my channel that I open with Citibank, and then be able to receive 500btc anytime because citi's side of the channel is fronted at 1000btc?
I have to admit I really have no idea how lightning works :(

My understanding is that a brain wallet is a phrase that you remember so you don't have to write down a complex key or other mnemonic. Like "My name is ElGuano and my birthday is May 5th." It's essentially a long passphrase. The problem is most phrases people think up are easily guessable. Imagine the number of people who tried using "to be out not to be" or "do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Discovering common phrases is easily automated and there must be countless bots scraping memorable quote sites and sweeping against the wallets those phrases hash to.
A seed list is a more or less random set of words and word orders that you do not think of as an intelligible phrase, so nobody can "guess" it by intuition or phrase book.

Here's an easy to think about it.
1. A private key is more or less impossible to remember. It's a jumble of characters and numbers.
2. One way to deal with this is to create a private key based something that can be remembered and reproduced, like a password.
3. A "brain wallet" is essentially a password. The promise is, "You think of a phrase only you know, and from that phrase, you generate a private key." If you ever lose the wallet, just remember your phrase, and your private key will be deterministically re-generated from it.
4. The problem is, people are not really creative with their phrases. Imagine the number of people who would create private keys with phrases like "password1234" or "live long and prosper."
5. Because the wallet is generated from the passphrase, anyone who uses the same passphrase gets the same private key to the wallet. So it is fairly trivial to scrape the tens of thousands of well-known phrases out there that people may use, and control those private keys.
Try this. Google how to create an SHA256 hash from a text string, and hash the phrase "satoshi nakamoto." Then Google how to turn a hash to a Base58check (wallet format). Import that key into your wallet, and check the transaction history. You'll see 50+ transactions where small amounts have been added and then immediately deducted from the account.
The reason is because several people wanted to see if "satoshi nakamoto" would be a good brain wallet phrase, but as soon as they deposited test transactions to it, *other people* who know that someone might try that phrase had already controlled the private keys and swept the funds.

Thanks, I do (at least I garner that I do) understand that part.
But does that mean what is happening is that miners and non-consenting nodes are at this point enforcing a "minority" position? 
Miners could determine that they're mining against a minority chain (or alternatively, if they switch to mining Bcash), but at what point (if any) does the "fact" that the majority of full nodes enforcing certain rules result in some kind of split/fork? 
I know my question reeks of FUD, but I'm honestly curious whether there's any kind of effect to BTC becoming a minority chain by virtue of full node voting.

I think I have a basic sense of how LN works, and this CP risk issue is really interesting. It sounds like it's mostly due to the fact that both parties have to pony up (i.e., commit) their potential spend/refund limits in order to open a channel, is that the case? 
In other words, if I'm "buying coffee" since that's what everyone wants to do, I have to lock up $20 or whatever in the amount of coffee I expect to spend over the next X days.
I get that I can close the channel and reclaim unspent funds, but that sounds a bit burdensome for day to day access to money, and I feel I'm going to be left with lots of "unspent" payment channel funds locked up and not "working for me."
What's the anticipated use case? I take it that it's not everyone having 500 individual channels open to their local Starbucks, supermarket, car dealership, gas stations, etc. Instead, does a person just commit $5000 to a hub and spend it down at various merchants who have their own hub channels? When the funds run low, instead of reloading funds do we close the channel and open another one back up with the hub again?

I think it's fine to do that, if you have already recorded and stored your 12-word seed somewhere. 
The idea is you memorize your passphrase and never write it down with your seed, so someone who gets your seed still cannot get your funds. 
So you can think of a passphrase, apply it to your existing seed wallet, and you get a new hidden wallet tied to your seed+passphrase. Make sure you have a plan to pass on your passphrase as well as your seed in case you "move on" as both will be needed for your heirs to recover your funds.

Ah, thanks. I wasn't aware of how Trezor works. It sounds like there is anti-logging on Trezor to address the concern, and if you are entering your seed on the keyboard already, it doesn't really change the security risk to do it with the passphrase as well.

Create a passphrase, tie it to an alternate PIN.
If you have a primary PIN, you now have two: one is your "normal" PIN, the other is "an even secreter" PIN. 
The idea is if you're being held at gunpoint, give them your normal PIN, or your 24-word seed which you should just keep a small amount on.
The "even secreter PIN" and passphrase you never mention, but what it does is house a separate wallet, which you keep the majority of your real BTC in.
When you escape, you rebuild your wallet with your seed and use the same passphrase, and you recover your secret wallet.

Oh no, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that the analysis in the OP seems wrong.
If Bitmain "controls" 25&amp; of BTC hashrate, and at the same time 100&amp; of BCH rate \(because they have a 25,000 BTC asics running and 2,500 BCH asics running\), then clearly they own "more" of the BTC chain if they flipped all their servers to BTC.

Do you have any authority to back that up? FinCEN has NEVER issued any guidance suggesting that.

One thing I'm not sure about--he says it's all to accomplish a single double-spend before they get detected and kicked off the network.  But how massive could that double-spend be? We're not talking about buying lawn umbrellas off Overstock, right? Can't that spend be taking all of Satoshi's 1M coins (minus the first block), along with whatever huge hoard accounts fit onto their fake block? 
They wouldn't be able to PERSISTENTLY attack bitcoin, but they could massively disrupt the existing balance with a well-targeted single attack, right?

3. State-as-uncontested-fact that the defendant did commit these untried acts when convicted of a lesser charge.

Maybe, I just figure the drop in price would disrupt the profitability of mining, which then drops the hashrate, potentially making a bunch of last-generation asics viable again, if not for long term mining, then possibly for a short or one-time attack. I really haven't thought it through, but considering these machines are worthless for nearly anything else, they either go in the trash or are stockpiled for a drop in difficulty?
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:52:00
Sure they can do any number of things to mask or obfuscate the trail (and I suspect they plan to). But it's very hard to do well, and there are extremely good blockchain analysis tools nowadays that make it even more difficult to hide.

I remember one high profile account where a user followed stolen coins through a tumbler (the volumes being laundered were way too high to be washed through the general volume of the tumbler). I'm far from an expert here, but regardless of tumbler, the record in the blockchain remains both public and permanent.
Plus, there's the point that the tumblers themselves can potentially be subpoenaed through valid law enforcement process, so you could keep following the money. Eventually, some of it would get siphoned off and spent, perhaps by unknowing innocent parties, but once you have warm bodies associated with the the addresses you can start building a personnel trail back alongside the blockchain transactions. At least in theory...

The guidance Indicates that cash to Bitpay to merchant account does not qualify as a fully satisfying the clearance and settlement requirement. FinCEN isn't interesting in what is more likely to fall into the rule. If you can setup a cash to coin scheme that works (have a baa-regulated issuing bank involved) in coin withdrawal, they will happily stipulate the exemption applies. But they care about all legs of the trip that constitute money laundering, I still don't see anything that indicates cash to coin is worse than coin to cash (think FinCEN just gives up when bad actors try to take the cash out of the laundromat?).

Contact law is not quite as simple as that, there are many, many legally accepted exceptions that can modify a contract on numerous grounds, or declare it entirely void, and the doctrine of equity can at times serve to alter the outcome or the obligations of the parties involved. 
In the traditional contract world you can't just say you will pay anyone who shows up at an address $100 and then expect the contract to be enforced on its face. Which is one of the reasons this is an interesting situation.

I'm just thinking about how Bitcoin can be attacked, and how tremendously increased latency can open new vulnerabilities.

I guess at its foundation my question is, are today's HODLers more or less immune for significant market fluctuations, are is there something that they may think is indicative of something bigger that would cause them to cash out/profit-take early en masse? And does that impact the HODL position generally?

That still doesn't say how dusting helps.... The only instance I can think of is if you dust a completely spent address that has a txn history, and then track the other address(es) that lump a future txn with the dust. Dusting a existing account with non-zero balance sounds useless to me....

I think it's in the vault. Tellers only carry a few thousand because it's enough to handle a few hours work if txns and they can always get more from the vault when they need.
ATMs probably need to hold enough to service withdraw requests for an entire day or more between service visits?

Thanks, that makes sense. The dusting target must be a previously used, currently depleted address that you hope to "reactivate" in the event of a sweep with other addresses. I wish the article specified this, because it was confusing the heck out of me.

This is what makes no sense to me. If you identify an address you'd like to watch, why do you need to dust it? Just track it for free on the blockchain!


Ok, this makes a lot more sense functionally. But....what is the point of dusting a random, non-used address in a space of 2^256 on the chances that it happens to be in a wallet and used in the future? If you're going to do that, you may as well spend your time hashing random private keys and tracking them in case they ever receive inputs. The only way I can see to target addresses to have would be if they're already been identified on the blockchain as holding value in the past... And if they've been used in the past, you can track their use history through blockchain analysis...
Sorry if I'm being dense!

Isn't that BTC's ATH of $19.5k+?
@_date: 2019-02-10 01:13:28
Wait. Bitcoins within the same address aren't "marked" or unique, right? You cannot say whether there is any first-out or last-out order. If they move 0.5btc out of that address, there's no way to tell if the dust was part of the move. They're not irradiated bills. Besides, the entire balance moves out in any spend txn, and your dust always ends up in a new address, which could be a change address. You could have just watched the target address without dusting it and you'd still know exactly what you know after losing your 546 satoshis + fees.
It seems to me that dusting only helps if you dust an old address with zero balance now, in case it gets swept with other addresses during a larger transaction (reactivation of a spent address may expose newly linked addresses).
@_date: 2019-02-10 05:42:19
Thank you, that was a really clear and detailed explanation.
The wallets I'm familiar with drain an address for any transaction from that address (so it would presumably use both a0 and a1 inputs despite the value of coins in either) and deposit the remainder in a new change address. So the dust would always go somewhere. It sounds like some wallets can isolate dust output, and will leave it inspect in an address that is otherwise used? In that case, can't the outputs that were used (sans dust) simply be viewed in the blockchain to see if they were spent with it's from other addresses in the same transaction?

I deal with chargebacks and compelling evidence regularly as well. But I think this argument of class actions is too general. That offers no comfort to consumers who worry about having no recourse with bad transactions. It doesn't have to be a serial scammer, the fact is once you pay the money you are at the mercy of the merchant's grace. 
If that's simply the way it is, then I do wonder if it will be a sufficient barrier to adoption of BTC/LN for everyday commerce. "Complain to the FTC or your state attorney general" just isn't really a realistic remedy imo.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:51:15
The first block of 50 bitcoins has a coding characteristic (not going as far to say it is a bug) that makes it unspendable. Not a big deal, but technically you would need to look to early blocks other than the genesis block to determine if Satoshi is moving coins.

This seems like a really obscure, but ultimately really poor hiding spot to me for reasons other then crypto. A guitar is very portable, it's used in a number of locations where it can be lost or forgotten, and it is a high value target for petty theft and burglary even at home. You also might get normal, friendly pressure to loan it to friends it or bring it to less safe venues where it may be lost. It's also not very resistant to fire, and difficult to carry around in a pinch if you have to get out quickly.

This is the difference between consensus and hashing power. 51% of hashing power only lets you make decisions consistent with network consensus (e.g., deciding which transactions to accept, which just be compliant with consensus rules). You would need a majority of nodes (one CPU one vote) to change consensus rules such as proof of work and max coin limit.
