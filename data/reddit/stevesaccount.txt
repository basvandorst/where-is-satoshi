I'm also thinking about putting in ~$100 a week. Any tips for doing so? Recently bought my first bitcoins after I came to the realization that bitcoin is a viable option for a currency. Good luck man!

I have always thought it was a neat idea, but recently when I started reading and educating myself about the technical details I really realized how great it will be. One of the biggest things I'm excited about is colorcoins. Recently started reading about it and I am beyond impressed. So much so that I just signed up on Coinbase so I can buy my first Bitcoin. :)

At this point you have such a distorted view of our government that anything I saw will be nullified by the "evil" they do. Sure, we need to stand up for what is right and fight "evil" in our government. But we should also recognize the good that our country does. Can the good be nullified by evil? I'd like to argue our country has done more for the human civilization than any other "empire" in existence. Do you know how many programs we have to help others around the world? The scale in which we help people is ridiculous.
