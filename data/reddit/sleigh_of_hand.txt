honestly there are good options that are not difficult for the average user. 
If it's an amount you aren't afraid to lose, get an android wallet like mycelium and move your coins there. Just make sure you follow the simple backup instructions.
If it's an amount you're afraid to lose, ie an investment, shell out a few bucks for a cryptocard and store it there. 
Either way, it's much safer than trusting an uninsured institution. large sites holding btc attract hackers and fraud like bees to a hive. No need to use them, even for convenience.

You could definitely do better on the user experience.  We were basically left with no information and an apparently-deleted wallet.  No matter that you didn't _actually_ delete the data, if you show us that extensions in which we've placed things of value can disappear (even malicious extensions), we will be taught to never trust chrome with anything we value (bitcoins _or_ valuable information).  That degrades the usefulness of all extensions.  If we can't trust them to not be removed without so much as a howdy do, then how are we supposed to trust them with our data?
You could learn from antivirus here.  Even when it flags something malicious, it only quarantines it for user inspection, and leaves the final decision up to the user.  You can warn me something is wrong, but if my data is in there, I need to have access to it.  Period.  Please investigate a better user experience in the near future.  Thanks.

Actually, credit cards cost buyers 2% through hidden charges to the merchants, who pass them on to the consumer through sticker prices.
Because sticker prices are uniform, you get no discount for using cash.  Therefore the 2% is actually borne by _all_ consumers, not just those who are using the convenience of the credit card.  If you've never owned a credit card in your life, you've still been subsidizing their network at 2% in hidden fees on every purchase from any establishment which takes credit cards, i.e. everywhere.
That's why you should use a system which costs you less (1%) and only costs those who pay for the convenience they receive, not those who have nothing to do with it and are being victimized.

To be fair, paying with credit has the same downside.  I have to go to the trouble of "converting" the credit I was issued into debit by paying my credit card bill.  That's the same level of difficulty I go through to acquire bitcoin for spending.
Oh, and if I forget to pay that bill, I get a 10% APR penalty added automatically.  I think we're simply so used to the mundane routine of paying bills that we forget credit has just as many steps.
Bitcoin may not have the convenience of allowing me to spend money which I don't yet have like credit cards do, but it will also never charge me exorbitantly for that convenience as well as never charging me 2-3% implicitly on _everything_ I buy, with or without credit, due to (now illegal) contractual obligations on merchants' disclosure of credit pricing practices.  Pick your poison, but I'll support the less evil option now that it is practical to do so.
Debit cards are another matter, and I'm a big fan of them over credit, but there you have the comparison with the bank and their practices.  If you want the option to not have to ask anyone's permission for your money, then you're the only one who can make that option happen, by choosing to support bitcoin and proving there is an economy for it.
You don't have to, and it's rational to not want to spend your bitcoin if you only view it as an investment or you aren't acquiring any at the moment, but if you want the option to exist, it needs support from someone.  It won't happen by itself.

I agree with you.  However, the government has been willing in some cases to create a safe harbor for nascent technologies where there is a public interest in doing so.  When the Internet was first becoming an engine of commerce, Congress decided to put a moratorium on any taxes in order to let it grow without unnecessary and potentially byzantine interference.  If we lobby them, there's a good case to be made that Bitcoin should receive the same treatment, even though it logically falls under the existing tax rules currently.

Your first thought experiment is quite clearly wrong.  Three things would happen if coins were evenly distributed to everyone:
1) Most people would immediately lose their key, or never get it in the first place.
2) Most of the remainder would do nothing with their coins.  You completely ignore the cost of learning how to transact coins.  What motivation do pennies provide to overcome that?
3) The remaining people might sell or hold on in proportion to their belief in the future, but would be an insignificant fraction compared to the first two parties.
Don't assume that the coins from the lost keys group could be considered as not part of the money supply, since that implies perfect  knowledge.  The best we could do would be to estimate a percentage which are truly lost, but that would be a swag at best.
Of the ones who didn't take the time to learn how to transact, as the value of coins rose, they'd have an incentive to learn, becoming a part of the ecosystem.  Many of them would sell everything up front, but would have realized significant gains.  Of those who didn't sell everything, they'd have a chance to become converts and benefit from the rising tide as adoption were to grow.
Those looking to achieve the kind of consolidated amounts that the existing mining scenario allowed would have to spend considerable amounts to do so, certainly more capital than most of them have had access to (satoshi certainly couldn't have).

Bid/ask spread should very well be taken into account when currency trading, since you're paying on the round-trip.  However it does not apply to the receiver of a donation, which is individual-to-individual exchange (one-way) where the value is predetermined by the donor not the receiver.  When a person decides to donate to you, the rational expectation is that that you will receive the value at the bid price.  The spread will already be taken into account on the donor's side, effectively passing the cost solely to them.  Once the cost is sunk with them, it is of no concern to the receiver.
So when I donated 2 millibits to your address, there was no spread cost to you, I've already factored that in on my side when I determined what value I wanted you to receive, much like I paid the mining fee for the transaction.   On your side the only cost is whatever fees come post-transaction.
To bitcoiners the point is moot anyway.  Whatever the spread, it doesn't compare to the volatility of holding btc.  The spread only matters when you are trying to quickly get into and out of btc in a round trip (which does happen sometimes).  Most of us have held our btc long enough that the spread is irrelevant now.

If we could turn back the clock and start from the beginning, I'd agree this would be the best idea.
Whether or not it's a good idea now, I think it would be extremely difficult to convince the development team that it would be worth the period of confusion.  Redefining the term bitcoin muddies the waters.  You can't have the same word mean two things without there being serious confusion.  Whether or not it would get sorted out, I have doubts the dev team would look well on that.  At the least, I think you're being a little cavalier about the logistics of such a move.
If it can't be a redefinition, I do think there's an opportunity to use something friendlier than microbitcoins, and I also think branding is critical to adoption.  Bitcoin is already complex enough without sounding complex.  A good slang term that's accessible to anyone would be better than micro in my opinion.  Hence the suggestion.
In any case, I do like bitcoins for 10e-6.  I just think it's too late.

My prior comment is meant to question the intent of the pool operators and so I provided information which calls their intent into question (I hesitate to call it proof, but it is evidence).  The nature of the past attack is irrelevant, just the fact that it was an attack goes to intent.
Partly, what matters now is intent and capability.  Provided the capability to perform any kind of 51% attack, what will they do?  Their prior actions are relevant and, if they can be determined malicious, make them untrustworthy.
Nevertheless even if they are trustworthy, for there to be a question of trustworthiness in the first place cuts one of the primary pillars of bitcoin out from under it.  Its greatest benefit is it' so-called "trustlessness", and now you have to trust a mining pool not to act badly.  That makes it no longer trustless.
Is it still useful?  Probably.  Is it as valuable as when it is truly "trustless"?  Unquestionably not.
On a different note, it sounds like you're unfamiliar with the categorizations of 51% and double-spend attacks as well.  Here's a good link:
The attack described in the thread to which I referred falls under "race attacks", and is indeed categorized as a double-spend attack.  Given 51% of the network hash power, all of the rest of the forms of double-spend attack also become available to Ghash.io, in addition to race/finney attacks.

While bitcoin is marketed as a virtual currency, there will always be volatility.  It is not nor is it meant to be the US Dollar.  The only proof necessary is the normal fluctuation of other currencies.
However, only psychology will determine whether it actual behaves even as stably as other currencies.  If it never achieves parity with currencies then it may forever behave like a commodity.  If people buy it as a hedge against market fluctuations such as precious metals are used, then it may actually move contrary to the dollar, which could completely prevent its use as a currency.  There is an inflection point between the two which bitcoin will have to pass in the human psyche, or else it will never achieve its overall potential.
