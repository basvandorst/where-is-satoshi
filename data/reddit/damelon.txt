I can only speak for myself here and say that I didn't address it because that is not the content of my response to your post.
My rebuttal is aimed at your way of constructing your argument, nót at a comparison between PoW and PoS.
If you want to make an argument based on assumptions and then swerve and decide to change the topic, fine. If you want to find that hilarious, also great.
"It's hilarious nobody addresses the simple argument that Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are diametrically opposed social constructs." is just another way of saying "I declare the people who are discussing here to be idiots because they do not agree with my concept of reality".
You have already decided that anyone who does not agree with you is an idiot. Let's just leave it at that, then. :)

I'm sorry, but all your statements about the "trustless" issue so far we based on the "history attack" and "Economic Clustering" being an integral part of Nxt.
As I have said: EC has not been implemented, and our whitepaper shows how a history attack isn't possible.
If you have other reasons for Nxt not being trustless, I would like to hear them.
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:35:44
Yes, this is possible, but what would you do?
Accept the loss of 500 BTC to regain 670, or do nothing?
@_date: 2014-07-22 09:59:22
By the way, you dó know that none of this has been implemented, right?
You are presenting it as your strongest fact, but it's not even ín Nxt.

If you don't underdatand the difference between "user error" and "inherent flaw in a system", you probably also are blaming each spelling error on the internet on the internet itself.

I have heard this argument before, by our forum member "iruu": 
The main issue here seems to be (and I am arguing from what I see from iruu's posts, so please correct me if you mean something different) that EC in Nxt is nót based on the same assumptions as the mathematical axioms which BTC is based on.
In the whole discussion, there was a confusion about BTC "mathematical laws" and the proposed system of EC (and it's still proposed!) based on "economic laws".
I invite everyone reading this thread to read these threads and make up their own minds :)

DGEX cannot do this, nor can anyone else: 


for 1440 blocks before it can be used for forging; moreover, the effective
balance of the account that generates each block is verified as part of block
validation. The extreme form of this attack generally fails because the Nxt
blockchain cannot be re-organized more than 720 blocks behind the current
block height. This limits the time frame in which a bad actor could mount this
form of attack.

Strong *claims*, but I see no proof. You do realise that these are *claims*, hopefully?
1. "Fair" has no place in this discussion. "Fair" is about social situation, not security. It's not a parameter that is useful in discussing crypto.
2. Prove it.
3. Can you clarify this statement? There are many implementations of PoS. Are you saying the security of PPC, Nxt or Bitshares is equal, even though their systems are not?
4. If there is no penalty, but the attack is not possible to even execute, this argument is moot. So for this argument to be valid, the possibility of succesful attack needs to be proven, which it hasn't.
5. Cannot comment on this due to lack of knowledge about this argument, so I won't.
I sincerely am not attacking you, but most of these arguments are very shaky and one of them doesn't make sense in the context of security. Maybe this is due to the brevity with which you formulated them.

"4.1.2 *History Attack*
In a “history attack”, someone acquires a large number of tokens, sells them,
and then attempts to create a successful fork from just before the time when
their tokens were sold or traded. If the attack fails, the attempt costs nothing
because the tokens have already been sold or traded; if the attack succeeds, the
attacker gets their tokens back. Extreme forms of this attack involve obtaining
the private keys from old accounts and using them to build a successful chain
right from the genesis block.
In Nxt, the basic history attack generally fails because all stake must be stationary
for 1440 blocks before it can be used for forging; moreover, the effective
balance of the account that generates each block is verified as part of block
validation. The extreme form of this attack generally fails because the Nxt
blockchain cannot be re-organized more than 720 blocks behind the current
block height. This limits the time frame in which a bad actor could mount this
form of attack."
Read the whitepaper: 
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:43:32
No, it's not.
It is not comparable to Bitcoin in this way, as Nxt expands on the blockchain idea.
"Better" would mean comparable entities.
@_date: 2014-07-11 20:01:18
No, that is actually a senior BCT member who is tagging the accounts.

It's fairly easy to prove prior ownership.
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:38:10
1. Unfairly giving yourself a permanent 51% stake through anonymous accounts allows you to have the appearance of a but actually value fiat.
This is an assumption. One that arguably cannot be disproved, but still and assumption nonetheless.
2. The onus of proof is the one selling the shitcoins. You claim it's a magical unicorn? Prove it. Bitcoin is designed so that even if the wealthiest people in the world buy all the coins and all the mining equipment, it can be antiquated by smarter people. PoS coins can be bought slowly and secretly through anonymous accounts until someone has permanent control. That kind of power is irresistible . I'm not saying it's likely. It's more likely they will create and market their own and just distribute 51% to themselves through anonymous accounts. Can I prove it? Well derp.
Both Vitalik and kushti are doing exactly that: working to provide proof, and if proven wrong, to work on ways to counteract the weaknesses. What I object against is the automatic naysaying. As to numerous scams being perpetrated, with ány system be it PoW or PoS: goes without saying. It'll happen, but whether that is inherent to PoS: assumption.
3. I'm saying you can clone any of them for no cost and have equal security to the original. There's no network effect because there's no network. Marketing will make them succeed.
Tally the list of coins out there on for instance CMC and make percentages of PoS vs. PoW. Most of them are PoW. Doesn't mean PoW is shit: it means people will make shit schemes where they can. 
4. If I buy 51%, then attack, and then sell all my coins I'm out nothing. How tough is that? You can't do that with Bitcoin hardware because it will be depreciated.
At the start of a coin: yup. With networks running for a year: nope. 
5. My arguments are simple because they are obvious. I'm not saying that PoS coins aren't useful. Every Central Bank should have one.
Your arguments also take into stide a lot of things happening at the same time. I'm not saying there are no weaknesses and things that máy be weaknesses. I'm saying your assumptions are at this moment unwarranted and generalised. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:40:21
The person you'd need to debate with is kushti. He's the one who wrote the paper on N As I said: I am just commenting on the fact that you use assumptions as the basis to draw conclusions. 
You responded by moving the goalposts of the discussion.
My response was at no point aimed at content, but at the structure of your argument.
If serious flaws are discovered in PoS, they need to be addressed. 
However, if the discussion just is made by broad generalisations that are usually preambled by "it's simple" and "obviously" that is often a sign that someone's mind is already made up.
Is it?

lol, are you still posting this old, old article with opinion, not proof?
Please go read some real research: 
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:19:09
So, let's put them here, too:
Your PoS paper, sadly is outdated and not backed by research. This has been known for a long, long time.
Please use properly defined terms and comment on them based on actual simulations.
Thén we both come at it from the same time and will have more than a useless bitchfight on reddit.
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:44:27
It doesn't really matter, now, does it?
Are you really going to accept conclusions from a paper that are nót backed by any kind of formal proof?!
Wow, that is quite amazing.
The writer himself says:
6. Is it possible to obtain a distributed consensus without provably consuming some resource
outside of the system?
Intuitively, the answer is no, but *there is no rigorous argument for this claim*
Hé, at least is pointing in the direction of research into this.
I offer you research, and you even refuse to look at it.
Taking things blindly on authority, probably because it aligns with convictions you consider important, is the worst kind of intellectual laziness and exactly the kind of misguided trust that consensus systems are trying to solve.
It's rather shocking to see you defending a standpoint, while at the same time trampling it by sloppy methods of research.

lol, whatever bud.
If *you* want to win an argument by an appeal to authority, that's your prerogative.
Your argument just lost any credibility.
If you have a need to put me in the shitcoin corner by "framing" me as a shill, have fun with that.
I am not putting you there. Your arguments speak for themselves.

If one miner decides to try and mine a 1 Tb block, so be it. 
It won't make any sense for him to do so, so he's only messing things up for himself.
Chances that anyone would want to work against his own best interests are small, if not negligable.
Game theory is a much a part of this as the technical considerations.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:39:49
Why should bitcoin need to work for all types of users?
This is a serious question.
What system is there that is so generic to be applicable to every use case?
This is an open question, not meant as suggestive or leading.
What if making bitcoin usable to handle millions of TX per second would actually mess with other benefits it has, like security, stability and the likes?
There are trade-offs to any tweak. There's bound to be someone pissed off by any that is made.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:35:49
It's probably fairer to say that bitcoin payment processors should never have promoted something the network isn't capable of (yet).
A lot of the problems are down to false advertising of functionalities that it's definitely not suited for as of now, without bothering to first make sure these things would actually come through.
Assign blame where it is due: Bitcoin "evangelists" who pushed it as a catch all blessing to replace all payment systems right now.
Now those who are getting heat for their false promises are trying to shift blame to developers, instead of owning up to their overpromising.
