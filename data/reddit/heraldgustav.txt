What an asshole... Man, don't pay attention to this douche. Maybe you don't like using FIAT money, but sometimes you have no choice if you want to eat. So, if you can or want, Try  It's a south american Exchanger that also works in Spain, I think.

While investors wait for the SEC decision, they can pass the time by setting up their own bitcoin kiosks. Peer-to-peer bitcoin technology company Paxful recently launched a new web widget, the Virtual Bitcoin Kiosk, that allows anyone to buy bitcoin worldwide instantly, with over 300 ways to pay up.
Users can reportedly embed the Paxful widget onto blogs, websites or even their Facebook page, allowing them to run a customizable bitcoin kiosk. Users can earn 2 percent commission from every sale made through their personal widget.

Oh shut up you douche! It's always the same with you. You call people scammers like you have ever had an account with them. You are only spreading dissinformation and ignorance.
Also, FYI E-Coin still exist and is the same as Wirex. You can go to their website and access the same platform that is in the Wirex Mobile App. So Go bother someone else with all your stupid fairy nonsense, jerk

As I Venezuelan Bitcoiner, I can tell you this actually it is not that far from the true. Buying the AntMiners can be expensive for a Venezuelan, as can be to bring them to the country, but that can be arrange if you have a partner with enough money to begin the operation with five S9 (that's almost 70 T/HS of power).
After that, electricity costs are a joke (I shit you not, it's like 10 cents of a dollar per month). Although, it is not a reliable service, as It is prompt to blackouts, which might destroy your miners...
But other than that, 2 BTC a day, with 5 S9? Easy piecy man. What you need is the money for the first investment

That's right. In Venezuela it's almost like that

Sure... Keep "fighting" from your keyboard man. You are the perfect example of the Reddit warrior, the keyboard activist. For every real person working out there to do great things for the Bitcoin Ideals, there are 100 of you who believes repeating stolen ideas and writing irrelevant post berating other's work because you can not do anything that requires more talent than complain.
You must be proud of yourself and all your "acomplisments". Keep "fighting" man the "good fight", dude :P

Yeah, whatever you say keyboard activist. Keep "fighting" man the "good fight" :P

Man, you are so Intense about this "Slaver masters" thing. Chill out, you are talking like an extremist crazy douche. Yes, everybody understand how much you love bitcoin, and everybody hopes you are right, because what you said is actually the ultimate purpose of bitcoin. But meanwhile, while Bitcoin is no treated like Fiat money, any tool or platform that helps other get close to bitcoin and in a way they understand, is useful and important
