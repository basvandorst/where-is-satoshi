You're delusional. KYC/AML does not and cannot ever result in "new users". In the whole world, there are not any people who think "well, I would use bitcoin, buuuuut I haven't received the intolerable and impossible to fulfil demands for extremely private personal information that's nobody else's business but my own from you yet, so sorry, I can't :( Maybe if you try to enslave and surveil me a bit more, ask me a bit more for things I wouldn't ever be able to provide under any circumstances, and undermine the whole purpose of bitcoin, then okay I would."
There should be huge protests about this. It's mass surveillance, and it's intolerable, it's not compatible with life.

From the beginning ever since Nixon invented it as part of the failed war on drugs, the entire premise of the "anti money laundering" attack on financial privacy is totalitarian surveillance and censorship. It's about enabling the state regime, with banks and compliant businesses as their helpers, to become the [Man In The Middle]( attacker for all transactions between people, with everyone under surveillance. It's about creating a parasitic machine filled with people whose "job" all day consists of intrusion of privacy, and making businesses the enemies of their customers. Their goal is that people who don't have government ID or a bank account can't transact at all. Fuck that.
Bitcoin is inherently anti-KYC. As Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in [the white paper]( describing some of the problems Bitcoin was created to solve:

[They aren't]( and no,


[of course it won't]( KYC goes against the entire [purpose of Bitcoin]( and recreates the problems it was designed to solve. For example, from the white paper:


The advantages and reasons to use any decentralized system come from problems with centralized systems, like non-ownership of your own money, intolerable and impossible KYC, mass surveillance, and being at the whim of the centralized operator.
