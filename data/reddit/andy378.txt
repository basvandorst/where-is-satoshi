I am sorry but your post is filled with ignorance. That is likely because you have never actually studied or benefited from these programs yourself, rather you accept other peoples talking points as fact. The SNAP figure is based on my own experience receiving SNAP. If you have an EFC of 0, Pell grants are enough to pay the complete tuition, fees, and books bill at state colleges around the country. Medicaid has been in existence for decades. The only people who are poor and lack medical care are unwilling to apply. If you have Medicaid, something I have also had in the past, you are asked to pay a $1 copay for services/drugs and no monthly fee. But providers can not refuse to see you if you cant afford it. If you have money to afford these things, you don't get them for free.

@_date: 2018-01-01 04:27:04
So you expect instant settlement? I am unaware of any platform with any economic activity that can provide that except LN. Even if they send a zero fee transaction and it gets stuck, the receiver can unstuck it when they consolidate their UTXO's with a market fee (child-pays-for-parent transaction). 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:16:31
That's more then is needed. If you bought the coins, get a receipt from the purchase and a receipt for the sale. The blockchain data is just going to confuse them. Ask what documents they would want if you sold a classic car then advocate that it's fundamentally the same thing and provide the same documents. Records of where you drove the car are not relevant, just that you acquired an asset and then sold an asset. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:43:04
That's more than likely why the shop has a limit on how much you can spend via BTC. It's their risk tolerance. Segwit or LN don't really change how this works at the end of the day, they just provide a path to this being a lower risk transaction for the seller. When you purchase with a credit card the payment is not guaranteed for the merchant. In a few days, the payment will settle and the merchant will receive their funds in the overwhelming majority of cases. A bitcoin transaction if effectively settled after a few confirmations and your full node client can validate it's a legitimate transaction almost instantly. 
Fees are dynamic not fixed, we are coming off a fairly major spike in fees caused by spam efforts to temporarily raise the fees. Now that the spike is over things are coming back to normal. The mempool will clear and &lt;100 stat fees will be common again until they aren't. This is fairly common in BTC these days. I did some transactions with &lt;100 stat fees over the last week and they have all confirmed, you just have to be patient. Nothing I was doing really had to be done instantially so I opted-out of the silly fees.

"Settlement of securities is a business process whereby securities or interests in securities are delivered, usually against (in simultaneous exchange for) payment of money, to fulfill contractual obligations, such as those arising under securities trades."

No, it doesn't make sense. At least in the USA, we have a silly government bureaucracy that does all of our home loans. The FNMA guidelines are very clear. If you can show the purchase and the sale of crypto, then it's an eligible asset. If trading is your sole source of income, you will need to show at least two years of tax returns that support your income claim and they need to be either even or on an upward trajectory. They can not discriminate on how you make an income, it either fits the existing, well document guidelines or it doesn't.

Until you post your stuck transaction id you are a liar. Post it and if it is how you say, I will apologize. You can't understand my point either, is English not your first language? I am saying you are impatient and that's why you are being stuck with high fees. If you waited for the next few blocks your fees would be trivial. If you used a decent wallet, you could use RBF to fix your "stuck" tx. If you have to get your heroin right fucking now, not that it won't ship any faster, then I guess paying for the premium of being in the next block is worth it, besides that or some emergency, its a waste of money. 
Edit: gtfo199 sent me a PM with his tx id...
that tx has a fee of 0.00022787BTC or $3.10 at the time he made it. A far cry from the $11.35 he claims to have paid. He is a fucking liar.

Ask how this would be different if you sold an expensive piece of art or a classic car. What documents would they require in that transaction? Banks operate off flowcharts, keep them on task.
I did this a few years ago. The underwriter wanted documentation of the purchase and sale. I had the receipt for the purchase in the form of an paypal receipt (was a mtgox era OTC tx) and Coinbase wrote a letter indicating that I sold x number of btc and received x dollars. As much as I like to hate on Coinbase, they were really on top of this request and seemed like it wasn't uncommon. Coinbase presented me with a question as to the source of funds when I did the sales, but it was a simple process. At the end of the day, it's a simple asset sale, nothing more. As long as you can document the purchase and sale you will meet the requirements in the FNMA (US centric) guidelines.

Not really. There are a handful of ways to compete and I don't see how any of them are going to cost $10M. I think it could be done for as low as $3M. The software to make it all work inst that complex to write and do properly. $1.5M tops, likely less. Depending on what regulatory treatment you want you will need at least $1M or so of capital that will be parked forever. The only purpose $10M would have is if you wanted to get a bank charter from the OCC or buy a bank. The OCC has stated they would like to charter such an institution. But its not necessary. There are three routes to operating an exchange in the US:
1. MSB: MSB's are loosely regulated by the feds and many states require registering as a money transmitter. In these cases, you have to post bonds and be licensed by various state. This is how coinbase and paypal are set up. 
2. Bank Charter: A bank charter pre-empts you from all state laws and having to register as a MSB. Gemini is set up this way as a Trust company, a type of bank, chartered by the State of NY. Costs anywhere from 3-5mil. A function State bank can be purchased for around $10M as well. Most state banks are required to have about $10M in capital. Meaning the owner's equity in the bank.
3. FCM: Being registered as FCM by the CFTC is an option as well. It pre-empts you from all random state laws. $1.5M to set up. Required $1M in paid-in capital. I am unaware of anyone doing this currently. You can also offer margin trading and short selling to some extent. Bitfinex was fined for not being a FCM and offering such services to US persons. 
Bank accounts have been trouble, there are several ways to solve that. If you have a bank charter, you are a bank, join the federal reserve and process your own ACH/Fedwire all day long. If you lack a bank charter, you can form a captive bank for far less then you suspect. For about $100-200k you can get an Industrial Bank charter from a few states. The exchange would be the only customer of the bank. That solves a lot of regulatory issues and is quite common in other areas of finance. Your captive bank can join the federal reserve and do its own thing. 
Coinbase sucks a competitor is needed. Gemini is good but needs more volume and some of coinbases "dealer" features like automatic buys. Competing in this space has lots of options but you need someone on the compliance side that knows the system and knows crypto or you will spend $3M on lawyers figuring out simple things and charging you for their learning time.

Walk into some local banks and talk to them about it. You may be surprised that they don't care or the conditions they are willing to work with you under. As for specific banks,  is who Gemini banks with. USAA is an investor in Coinbase amoung other crypto holdings and would likely be a good option (if you qualify). Poke around, smaller is better.

More presumption. SNAP varies by state, maybe that's the factor, but I did not lie. At the time I received it I had 0 income and was hospitalized for several months. It put the food on the table and I am grateful the assistance it provided. Due to the same factors, I was also on Medical Assistance (MA), what my state calls their Medicaid implementation. My state buys a blue cross plan and is accepted everywhere blue cross is. All my doctors from my old private plan took my MA plan. No one questioned it in any way, I live and receive medical care in an upscale area. The only trouble I had with providers was dentists.
I completed a 4-year degree with Pell grants. I never paid in and never took out loans. I worked to pay my day to day bills. It is possible I received a few hundred a semester in a needs-based scholarship, but the Pell grant covered 98% of the bill. A check of a 4-year state college near me shows they charge $241.00 per credit or $5784 for two 12 cr semesters.  No major difference from when I did it. People who choose to pile up loans by not working or going to a school that charges $30k/year in tuition are electing to do it. Better options exist but if you feel you need to have a BMW vs a Toyota, you will pay for it in the end. 
I could go back and forward with you on why you are wrong and how you don't have a clue what you are talking about, but there is no point arguing with someone who has already made up their mind. Cheers.

Better advise is to call the receipt of BCH misc/other income as of the day of the fork. If you sold, any difference from the price at the fork to the sale date would be a short-term capital gain/loss. The fork price is your cost basis for any future transactions. The receipt of BCH is income, not a capital gain. see:

That will likely confirm in the next week. If you are in a hurry you can RBF the fee up to 100 stat/b or higher. If you control the receiving address you can unstuck it by doing a child pays parent. Worst case it will fall out of the mempool eventually and your wallet will let you respend.

I made a lot of transactions over the same time period and paid 100 stat/b ($3.15) or less. All the 100 stat/b tx's were confirmed in 3 blocks and 60 stat/b ones in a day. If you have a stuck transaction you are not using RBF that would allow you to unstuck your tx. I am not a believer that you have a stuck tx with a fee as you describe. Unless it has a ton of UTXO's, it has been confirmed. Post the transaction id or you are a liar spreading FUD.

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:14:02
The tax bill is due in the year the tax event occurred. Everyone who owned BTC received BCH. That is a taxable event. The only question is what price of BCH do you use. The tax code and related tax court cases say once you have the ability to control an asset, it's a taxable event. Your knowledge of receipt is not required. If you control your keys, the event occurred the day of the fork and it is reasonable to use the average price on that day to calculate the income that needs to be reported. Since Coinbase held back control, their customer's tax event occurred today and the tax is due for this year. Even if you are part of the I don't pay taxes club, Coinbase will hand over the records to the IRS soon enough and they will come find you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:41
The tax nightmare they unleased is worse then market manipulation. Chain splits are misc income as of the value when you had the ability to control them. 
On the fork day, the BCH price was $267. So a hodlr of 100 BTC received $26.7k in ordinary taxable income. A Coinbase customer had no way to exercise control over their BCH until today, so the taxable event was today. Today's average price is massively higher. Let's use 3k for sake of discussion. That's $300k in ordinary income that needs to be claimed. An extra 300k in income dropped on you with two weeks left in the year, how are you suppose to plan for an extra 100k in tax due?? Something you didn't ask for but was forced upon you. If you ignore it, the IRS will get the records from Coinbase and come after you for tax fraud in due time. You are easy low hanging fruit and the us.gov loves to go after bitcoiners.

That only works if you do that and it it happens in 2017. In 2018 you will need income for it to offset. You can only use $3k per year in capital loss carryforwards.

I would be concerned that an argument could be made that this is tax fraud. One should at least make a notation in their records that they received the fork coin and mark it with a cost basis of zero. Then the argument is about if your cost basis is reasonable or not vs the appearance of outright fraud. This is a high-risk approach and I don't recommend it. Consult your legal and tax advisor.

You are wrong. Anytime there is an ascension of wealth, taxes are due. The only way to maybe defer taxes on property is with a 1031 exchange (but not after 2017 due to proposed tax changes). In that case, every transaction needs to be reported in the year it happened for the tax deferral to have any effect. I regard that a high-risk strategy and it should not be employed without a tax opinion from a qualified professional. At least you have protection from IRS penalties in that case. 
If someone gives you 15k gold bar, its taxable in the year you got it. The IRS has extensive rules on taxing bartering that fully apply to virtual assets. It's not like we are the first people in the world to think of this. The gold bar is income when you receive it then a capital gain/loss if/when you dispose of it. Examine the three factors in Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426 (1955).

Coinbase alone isn't enough for a SAR and if they want to plug up FinCIN with BS SAR's I guess that's their issue. Most banks send potential SAR's to a committee to decide if one should be filed. They can get in trouble for needlessly filling them. As for CTR's not sure how that would apply, there has been no discussion of cash. If cash was part of this, they would be reporting you as a potential unlicensed MSB. Then you would have Homeland Security Investigations all up in your shit.

If the owner of the BCH was intending to hold them, taxes would have been much smaller if they were delivered on time. Then the choice would have been the owner when to sell and pay the capital gains, hopefully at a more favorable rate. The amount of wealth generated prior to taxes is the same. We are talking about the difference between $100k tax bill vs a $4-8k tax bill for 2017, assuming you still hold all of the BCH.

I feel that Deloitte is saying the same thing I am. The only exception they are making is if you lack dominion as outlined in Glenshaw Glass then no income is due. As my original point is related to how Coinbase handled this, when they credited it to your account, you met the three factors in the Glenshaw Glass test. Mear knowledge of a fork and its value may be enough to meet all of the Glenshaw factors. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:10:02
The fork caused a minor tax bill on creation. By holding back the ability to control the coins, Coinbase created a tax event 11x larger for their customers. This is tax caused by the receipt of BCH, not by its sale.

Ok, let me set up the assumptions first. Let's imagine two people. Person A has 100 BTC in a bitcoin core client and Person B has 100 BTC at Coinbase. On the date of the BCH hard fork, Person A, had full access to their keys and could claim their BCH if they wanted to. Person B was unable to claim their BCH until yesterday. Both Person A &amp; B held their coins as of today and have no intention of selling them.
Let's talk about the tax code quick. In 1955 the Supreme Court decided a case called Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co. The fundamental issue, in this case, was when is something income, for tax purposes. The court came up with a three-prong test to determine if something is income. The prongs are an accession to wealth, clearly realized, and complete dominion. You can read the full case at  to better understand these prongs/factors. Once all three have been met, you have taxable income.
But that case isn't all. There are a number of cases in the years since that define how those prongs work. The IRS is kind of a squishy organization in how it applies the law so many people get away with reporting strategies that are high risk. Many accountants will happily go along with this. This does not mean they are right. Let me digress into a quick story about this. 
I was recently in a large business meeting. One of the topics was how to deal with a tax issue. This was not a crypto issue but an agriculture taxation issue.  We were looking at some higher risk vs safer reporting strategies. The accountant said, "ill defend whatever option you choose". I interpreted that as, go ahead and pick the high-risk strategy because if the IRS calls you on it, I will get to bill another $10-20k to deal with it. He had his own motive and it was obvious to at least me. It was really an interesting moment for me. Keep this in mind when you get questionable tax advise. Ok back to the example. 
IMHO, there are two schools of legitimate thought on how chain splits match up with the Glenshaw factors. The first thought would apply to Person A. If you never touch the BCH keys, one may argue that you never met any of the factors. I do not agree with this line of thinking. Although this argument of ignorance is possible for some random fork you don't know about, if you are reading this subreddit, you know about it. The accession of wealth happened when the chain split happened. By owning the keys you have clearly realized it. The IRS has considered the idea that you know about it but avoid claiming it. This is addressed in 26CFR1.451-2 that says you realized it if you had constructive possession. In this case, the keys are enough. Owning the keys also checks the boxes for complete dominion. Person A has full ownership of the BCH regardless of if they do anything to take control. In this case, Person A's taxable event was the date of the fork. They need to report ordinary income of the value of the BCH. You can not adjust your basis or call it a dividend as some claim because the statute that permits that applies only to securities. So Person A has about 27k in income to report and pay on at their marginal tax rate. Tax due on this would likely be between $4-8K depending on the taxpayer's marginal rate. 
Ok Person B. They had their 100 BTC in a Coinbase vault. On the day of the fork, they had an Accession to Wealth. It would be reasonable for them to start listing the value of their BCH in their net worth spreadsheet for example. But they lacked the other two factors until yesterday. Ther taxable event was yesterday. As such, they need to calculate their income on this transaction based on yesterdays prices. I suspect that the average price on Coinbase for BCH yesterday was a number larger than $2500. But for the sake of discussion, let's say its $2500. That's $250k in taxable income based on the receipt of the BCH. If the BCH airdrop was the only income you had then it's going to be at around 30% or 75k.
Once you receive the BCH airdrop and establish you tax basis if you sell after that, its a capital gain/loss from that point. Now Person A may be the type of person who likes to ignore the tax law. He may be able to do that, but one day the IRS may catch up with him. On the other hand, Person B had this transaction take place at Coinbase. 
It is very reasonable that the IRS will receive a report of this eventually and when they see that you failed to report this income serious big trouble will follow. With your tax return and the records from Coinbase, the government possesses all the evidence needed for a tax fraud conviction. It likely won't go that far, but the IRS will want its money and the accountant who said this was ok will want a lot of money to defend you in it. This is why I have advocated in getting a written tax opinion from a qualified professional. This shifts the liability back to them. Watch how fast they change their tune when you ask for one. 
Person A and B both possess 100 BCH still and they have the same amount of wealth in BTC and BCH, assuming no changes happened in the interim. They have dramatically different tax situations based on when they met the Glenshaw factors.

They don't expire. But I am suggesting you write an expiration date on a seed you hand over to your random family/friend. Then there is certainty as to when you can reclaim the gift they never claimed. I know several people who handed out paper wallets containing whole numbers of BTC in an effort to bring people into bitcoin back in 2011-12ish. She kept all the addresses and less then 1% were ever moved.  
I am just opposed to handing out coin at all at this point. It's just asking for trouble down the road. When aunt Mildred loses her paper wallet that's worth a million dollars, she is going to blame you. It matters not that it's all her fault. Family drama will ensue. Hell, I have family drama for basically not forcing my relatives to buy BTC. I tried to evangelize the ones that it was a fit for and now they are bitter. Same with some friends. All my fault they didn't follow up on what was told to them or didn't believe in it. 
In the Christopher Wallace's hymn, Ten Crack Commandments, addresses this well: "Keep your family and business completely separated Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch.

For US taxpayers, sites like  will help you track your activity and generate the needed IRS forms or TurboTax export files. Tax events occur whenever you sell something. Exchanging BTC for LTC is a taxable event. Selling BTC for USD is a taxable event. Only taxable events need to be reported. Plan that your exchanger will eventually be forced to hand over the records of your sales to the IRS. Look at Coinbase or all the people who figured they were safe in Switzerland, until that all changed. Taxes are cheap vs being busted for not paying taxes and they will get the records, it's just a matter of time.

You and your tax advisor are entitled to their opinion. It is my opinion that this is a high-risk reporting strategy based on Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426 (1955). I generally don't think arguing against fairly clear supreme court rulings is a good idea. I think you should get it in writing that your tax preparer thinks this is the right way to go and his legal basis. This will protect you from future penalties should the IRS go after you. This will protect you if there is an issue down the road. I think the risk of your strategy is dramatically lower if you had control your keys on the fork date. 27k in ordinary income being incorrectly reported isn't enough to necessarily get the IRS's attention. If you are part of the Coinbase distribution, 300k is. As for adjusting your cost basis like in a stock split, the statute on that only applies to securities.

He is an asshole for the tax disaster he unleashed on his customers. By waiting to allow control of BCH until today, mixed with a major BCH pump, combined with the knowledge that all of the records will land in the hands of the IRS very soon is borderline economic terrorism. Leading tax advise is that chin forks should be counted as misc income for US persons. The tax event occurs when you have any ability to control the asset. For those in control of their keys, it was the day of the fork. The IRS cares not if you even know it happened, you are on the hook. 
On the fork day the BCH price was $267. So a hodlr of 100 BTC received $26.7k in ordinary taxable income. A coinbase customer had no way to exercise control over their BCH until today, so the taxable event was today. Today's average price is massively higher. Let's use  3k for sake of discussion.

I think your Deloitte opinion covers the "fork I didn't touch argument". If you know of the fork and its value but choose not to do anything, you may still be in a high-risk position in regards to the IRS. When an exchange dumps the fork coins in your account its hard to argue you are not in control of them. As for random forks, if it has no value, or really under $600 in real market value at the time of fork, there is a good argument to be made that you are not required to report it. My point generally is about how Coinbase handled this situation and how it has negative tax impact for their account holders. edit: those rulings are the same that are referenced in the Deloitte report you posted.

Assuming you are a US person, it's all long term capital gains. Taxed at a maximum rate of 20%. If you sell smaller amounts over time, the rate can be 0% and still enough to live off for most of the country. So some planning may be helpful. Sell it on a US exchange, avoiding some regulatory snags. Then give the sale records to your accountant. 
People make a big deal about how complex this is and it isn't. You could spend a few hundred grand on setting up various tax schemes, but with the amount of money we are talking about, you won't get much benefit. All you need is the local family accountant.

Without decentralized mining, BTC dies. Everyone needs to do their part. It doesn't matter what PoW algo it is, we still have to participate.

I don't buy that the market is unregulated, at least in the US. The CFTC has regulatory authority over bitcoin and has taken enforcement action against bitcoin companies for violations of its rules. 
The Commodity Exchange Act gives the CFTC authority to pursue a variety of manipulation, fraud, and false information ( related issues in addition to criminal acts ( There is also a right of private action, so anyone engaging in illegal activities could be sued by anyone who was damaged.
US persons involved in any schemes better watch out, there is a five-year statute of limitations. If your lawyers think this is ok, go hire one that has actual commodity experience.

It's not really the CFTC. The CME as an exchange is a stand-alone regulator that the CFTC delegates its day to day authority to. It's the same in securities, the SEC delegates its day to day authority to the exchanges and FINRA. The CME runs their clearinghouse and it guarantees all the trades. They are very good at risk management and will not be left holding the bag. Take a look at what happens in the grain markets and if they can manage that, BTC won't be an issue for them.

Built into all derivatives prices is a carry cost. Over time that will decay away. That's where the market makers make their money. They also make good money being on both sides of a trade as they don't have to hedge a good part of their book. 
The BRR is a one-hour VWAP from the participating exchanges. You don't need the physical to arbitrage it. If I go short the futures and long OTC with the intent of arbing it, I still have to wait for expiration to book my profit. That profit can be in dollars or btc depending on what conditions the trade was taken. When I arb OTC markets I book a profit when the trades are offset and closed. But I still have to fuck off to rebalance the cash between exchanges to do more of it. I don't see how it's very different except more efficient with futures. 
The BRR isn't what you deserve, its what you agreed to when you engaged in the futures contract. If you don't like it, don't trade it. I am with most that physical markets would be preferred, but legacy finance isn't there yet.

Centralized mining is all of our faults and we are the only solution. I was a large miner up until the ASIC era and then I stopped. That was a mistake. If 300,000 of us bought one modern ASIC each, that's 1/4 of global hash. Us hodlr's need to take a more active role in bitcoin and buy some mining gear. I don't care if I make big bucks on it, it protects my hodling and helps secure a decentralized bitcoin. As a result of last weekend, I am getting six ASICs and will run them as long as possible. I don't care if I make money on it. This is the mindset that is needed to solve this issue, the same one that existed when I first mined.

I think that's an irrational fear. With the position limit of 1000 contracts in the spot month, the most one actor could do is $33mil worth of btc (5000 btc). If they acted in with the goal of trying to crash the price, it would be illegal. Banks have gotten quite shy of manipulation after the LIBOR fixing scandal. All of the international banks have left the LMBA fixing process out of legal concerns. If a bank or large institution wanted to go crazy short, the OTC market would be the place to do it, the futures market is too regulated. Bitmix who appears to operate as a bucket shop ( is the place to do this type of crap. 
Shorting into Oblivion leaves me thinking of some form of a reverse corner. Everyone who has ever attempted a corner tends to have lots of issues ( and is no longer legally permissible. This is incredibly fucking dangerous and no institution would put its self on the line in this way. Let's say you shorted the max amount, 5000 contracts over the entire term structure (btc futures are quarterly). So the most you could do is 25k BTC or about $167 million USD. BTC has in its past doubled and halved in a 24h period. The risk of loss is far too great for that level of risk. Contrast that to 24h BTC OTC volume of about $4 billion. So the most you could do is 4% of current BTC trade volume, good luck shoring into oblivion like that. 
All examples use $6700 as BTCUSD.

A market maker is in the business of providing liquidity to the market. They have committed to buy and sell the instrument at any price in any amount. They will need to hedge their market-making portfolio with the underlying instrument. This could be considered a form of arbitrage, but generally, a person engaging in arbitrage is doing so as their goal. They absolutely need the physical bitcoin from the exchanges that make up the index or they stand to lose their shirt.

Umm, I am on your side but your argument confuses. 
1. How does segwit2x drive the price up? The price was driven up by real demand and news about more real demand (CME). This force is far bigger then the 2x crowd seem to understand and has been in play for well over a year.
2. It is my understanding that Jihan has a bachelors degree in psychology. Anyone who attended college knows this is a joke and isn't the basis for any deep psychological understanding. This is a major lazy people who cant complete rigorous academc work or the mentally ill choose. 
3. Obviously to create false demand. 
4. No disagreement. 
The 2x crowd claims to have enough BTC that their conversions from BTC to BCH is enough to create the price move. They may feel that the major sellers have already converted and the market pressure is low. I think they are very wrong and in the end, this will be a monumental money burning exercise. Same as every prior effort to corner a commodity.

I am a veteran futures trader so let me provide some ADD mansplaing that will likelly only confuse you more. 
When an order to buy and sell is matched, a futures contract is created. For example, a seller, who is going short, could then buy a contract, closing out their position. Depending on how all this works out in the end, you have the open interest, the total number of contracts outstanding. You do not need to own any btc to go long or short the future. When you go long/short a future you are entering into a contract to deliver or accept the commodity at some point in the future. For cash-settled futures you are agreeing that rather then the physical commodity, you pay/receive cash at an index rate on some future date.
For the CME futures, they publish a once a day index rate, in this case, its the Bitcoin Reference Rate. They take trade data from OTC BTC exchanges and create a volume-weighted average price (VWAP). This VWAP is calculated using the hour before 4pm London time each business day. It's a little more complex then that, if you care, read the paper at  
Example: I short BTC at 6000. On the expiration date, the BRR price is 6100. So I owe 100 per btc. My broker will deduct the cash and transfer it to the exchange and release my performance bond. 
According to the CME's BTC contract specification ( each contract will be for 5 BTC. So a contract is about $35k worth of BTC. As discussed earlier, when you buy/sell you enter into a contract for future delivery. In this case, cash based on the BRR. You have to post a performance bond that is set by the exchange, this is the required margin. We do not yet know what the margin requirements will be. I suspect something like 20:1, so maybe $1750. Intraday, overnight, etc will have different margin requirements. We will have to wait for the exchange to set this and brokers can increase it if they desire. As the exchange is on the hook for all trades, when things get hairy, they are quick to raise the margins in somewhat crazy ways. I would not put it past them to switch from a 20:1 to a 4:1 in one days time. In that case, you either have the cash or you are going to get liquidated. 
There will be a price spread between OTC BTC and the BRR. The market will decide that soon enough, but there is plenty of money to be made being a market maker between the OTC exchanges and the futures market. They will move in lockstep. 
Manipulation is illegal. It is illegal before futures and even worse after futures. One should expect that the exchange has surveillance agreements ( &amp;  with all of the exchanges that provide pricing data for their index. If you are not a TBTF bank, you get fucked fast if you engage in manipulation. Honestly, I expect a lot of the manipulation in BTC to go down as a result of this. People need to familiarize themselves with the Commodity Exchange Act as that is the future of Bitcoin regulation. If you do engage in manipulation, the futures market will steamroll you if you are not capitalized at the level of a TBTF bank and stand ready to burn more cash then Roger Ver propping up BCH. The TBTF Banks that play games have huge physical positions in the commodities they manipulate. Warehouses full of metals, for example, give them regulatory cover to play some of the games they play. Not really an apples to apples comparison with BTC. 
On top of that, there are position limits. No one person or entity can have more than 1000 contracts in the spot month or 5000 total across all months. All holdings of 25 or more contracts are reportable. This mechanism keeps any single player from being able to push the market. Hard to manipulate with tight these position limits. 
Some concepts have been simplified for sake of explanation. edit: added some links, fixed some spelling, forgot position limits per self-admitted ADD.

The current situation would not have been solved by PoS. A cartel of miners has gone rogue and we have two options to solve that. We can either change the PoW (including a switch to PoS) or we can put our money where our mouths are and build distributed hash power. 
There are more of us and together we can beat them. If ~280k of us bought ONE ebit or other ~9Th+ miner that more then 1/4 of global hash rate. It puts a stop to these games and restored the distributed nature of bitcoin. Power always to those who show up, its time we start showing up... How much money do we lose by letting people manipulate bitcoin for their own gain? A lot more then the risk we take by buying 1-4 miners.

The CFTC has ruled that bitcoin is a commodity in the Coinflip order (2015). So knowingly spreading false or misleading information about it would be a violation of Rule 180.1. The CFTC's authority extends to commodities, not just derivatives. 
The rule:
17 CFR 180.1 sub. a(4): Deliver or cause to be delivered, or attempt to deliver or cause to be delivered, for transmission through the mails or interstate commerce, by any means of communication whatsoever, a false or misleading or inaccurate report concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of any commodity in interstate commerce, knowing, or acting in reckless disregard of the fact that such report is false, misleading or inaccurate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no violation of this subsection shall exist where the person mistakenly transmits, in good faith, false or misleading or inaccurate information to a price reporting service.
