Agreed, I was against incentive of holding and thinking that way Bitcoin will turn into a currency. Those two things are rarely reconcilable. As you point out extremely few people hold bitcoin and prices are so speculative no one can afford to use it as a currency. 
The way things are now, i can only see it become the "Internet gold" to transfer value.

The value it has to hodlers of course lol 
The thing is holders and merchant dont want the same thing even. Hodlers want the price to keep increase and merchant want a stable currency.

So you create new money by hodling ? LMAO
Wonder what would happen if everyone  hodled their fiat. 
Dont lie to yourself, everyone is hodling here to make US dollars at the end. The rest is up to politics and retails not the hodlers.

Yeah as a currency this is troublesome to most economist. Not as commodity thou which is how I see bitcoin.

Thanks will look into blockchain.info, 2FA is a must these days. Think i get Ledger Nano S eventually thou or just writing everything on  piece of paper like private key etc, and stored safely. Dont know if that is possible way even ?

Not sure about this one the clerics didnt look at this but it doesnt sound ok to me, POW is better here.  Basically making money just by owning money without any sort of work/service or increase of value in your assets is not allowed, but the depends on how you look at things i guess. Here is a debate about it on reddit post.

Man, I can see this happening like wild fire in the muslim world. All it takes is a few clerks to put the word out. Plus muslims in western countries barely use banks for anything else than storage and sending money, so they wont miss the corrupt banks anyhow.

Not according to Islam, but humans do bad things including rich muslims. Thats not news.

Islam is based on fair play between rich and poor.  As Bitcoin does not deal with interest, as of now, it conforms to Islam better than fiat. FIAT currency which is based on usury and banks who deal fractional reserves is not allowed in islam. This means basically all Banks that deal with with interest are haram (prohibited). However gambling with your livelihood is not allowed in islam, so the speculative price of  bitcoin that can ruin people life will definitely be frowned up on by clerics. So once the prices settle down, cryptocurrency with no interest and no middle man fees and the fact that you have full control of your money is a better option for Muslims.

At this point 2-3k more is nothing to worry about. We are talking 10 -
100K differences very soon. I think it will be worth a million or more if everything works out.
