"My thought is this; that understanding that the dollar is unstable as it is, at this point the Fed might try to create an alternative. And an alternative that's more under their control than the dollar and actually out of the traditional banking system. What would happen if the Federal Reserve created a look-alike dollar? Let's call it the Fedcoin. Perhaps based on the same technology that Bitcoin is based on. This is the blockchain technology where every transaction can be tracked from the creation of the Bitcoin itself.
I suspect the next stage on the part of the governments since they've tried quantitative easing; can't do that too much more after creating trillions and trillions of these paper dollars which are going to come out of the financial system and into the retail system exploding prices.
Zero interest rates and negative interest rates; huge distortions. That's going to come to an end.
What are they going to do next when the – as we enter the trailing edge of the hurricane and everybody will say, do something, do something? Well, what can they do? They've used their two major tools so far.
My guess is they're going to come up with a – with a completely digital currency called the Fedcoin which will actually act as a parallel, alternative to the dollar. It will have a lot of advantages from the government's point of view and as much of people seem to like Bitcoin, the public may accept it to start with."
Is anyone else banking on this sort Fed issued coin. 
I know last year i read that The Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan (?), had of course played with the idea of creating their own Blockchain for their national currency. 
How likely is it that major governments will start issuing Fedcoins? How soon?

Someone please explain to me how this is a good idea for him to do this so late in the game? How big of an operation does he have? how will it be cost effective to run this compared to places like China?  Is he just wanting to counter balance the overseas mining to redistribute the power the chinese have with their monopoly?

People keep asking me if I invest in Bitcoin. Here's my answer...
My view on Bitcoin trading is similar to Warren Buffett's view on trading Gold:
“[Gold] gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.”
The idea that Bitcoin has any intrinsic value is absurd.  I prefer to invest in businesses and people that can provide real impact and value in other people's lives. 
Capitalism is the idea that a business can create value, primarily in terms of cost savings or money making by creating value and that the business retains a percentage of the total value provided by that company in the marketplace. 
Trading currencies is not a capitalistic endeavour. It is purely speculative. -Ben Simkin, internet marketer

Doesn't this make Bitcoin, and particularly this company, look like a gimmick?! honestly, a guy with dozens of concussions and head injuries, who doesn't know north from south, is not merely in the ad for the company but has its tech machine named after him... 
Bitcoin is smart, edgy, and the future. Why would we dive into the past and use a washed up Hasbeen from decades past, doing the troll advertising and marketing for a bitcoin machine?
head scratcher for sure.

also, Because of it being pseudo-anonymous, do ransoms via bitcoin carry significant advantages that would cause them to become too overwhelming?

I thought Ebay didn't allow funded (unused) Casascius coins to be sold on their site. Did they change their tune?
