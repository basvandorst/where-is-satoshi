For all you noobs, buy buy buy now!

How do you get Ripple?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:41:43
Based off what happened [yesterday]( , will coinbase still be going live with bitcoin cash at 9am, or will it wait until this investigation is over?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:47:39
Will they announce what they found in their investigation? Because yesterday was full of shady shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:38:23
You have $1,000 to invest, where do you put your money and why? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:38
 Technically, they HODL'ed
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:24:39
 Don't do that silly
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:50:58
Dang, better claim those capital gains!

Today is the day folks who are late to the BTC party can get some skin in the game for a decent price if they time it right. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:19:06
So why can't you buy BCH on Coinbase still? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:19:30
I have been wanting to get some Ripple but not sue the best way to do it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:10:56
I know this is a BTC sub, but would it be wise to move a little BTC to Ripple?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:26:23
Today is the day a lot of apples will be shook to the ground from the BTC tree. HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:53:53
Can someone ELI5 the coinbase fees?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:48:37
Bitcoin over say Ripple or Ethereum? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:18:25
Just a beginner to buying outside of Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:05:07
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:23:53
 Why do you say that? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:44:30
Yeah that's why I want to explore there. Plus Amazon and PayPal looking into it. Might be a solid move. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:54:54
Don't listen top this propaganda folks. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:02:19
Womp womp womp, what a letdown. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:38:53
 Where can you see the sell orders?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:22:43
 Will we have the ability to buy it on Coinbase eventually? Asking for a friend
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:01:00
Been waiting all day
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:40:28
How do you see tax return season impacting the market? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:18:23
 Right? Do they have to wait until the investigation is over?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:30:52
Dang save some for the rest of us
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:54:37
 Just a guess but I bet all of our blood pressure will be higher today
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:29:00
Is it to late to invest in BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:05
The amount of movement before it was on coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:05:23
Well HODL it is! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:10:05
 If you have funds that are pending to show up in your Coinbase account, can you still sell them?
