And get equity eaten by fees and having to deal with capital gains tax on a minimal return? Not to mention it's kinda limited on how many you can buy at once.

Lmao! I needed this after reviewing my NKE ticket this morning.

Good man. Don't sell for a few years and let's go yachting together.

Meh if your aiming for low profits. Do you consider yourself a day trader? Be smart and buy at dips and hodl. For example on coinbase you can never buy more than your sell limit. So even selling at dips you will have to be very active and predictive to make $$ when rebuying. Everyone's different tho. I have been in it for a bit and just average up at dips. It's the only way to build my btc empire with hopes of withdrawing 1m in 2 years.
