That is really cool, I played at the Greeley Blues Jam festival this past year with a Michigan/Australian band and Greeley seemed like a really nice place, and stuff like this makes it seem like an even cooler place. Definitely a city I want to play in on my own tours when heading west!

Some bull

Are other exchanges better for changing small amounts of shitcoin into BTC or Ether for example? Changelly says stuff like "amount too low for X shitcoin, try 800+", which is ridiculous. Is BitTrex or something better for small amounts or will everything get lost with changing cheap shitcoins in small amounts of BTC?

Yeah same here, probably need some business or finance related degree even though crypto is "new territory"

How was asking a question being hand fed? Douchey remark

I was thinking of getting a 2 year certificate or degree, I wonder what would be most applicable to Bitcoin and crypto industry??

They're going to make an office in Manhattan. That's pretty big, even if just symbolically.

Wow what a scam, this whole pump up to $7500 was people wanting to get in on 2x coins before Nov. 16. Bad for public legitimacy of bitcoin.

A million is plenty still in Manhattan, you just get a $2000 1 bedroom not a $5k 1 bedroom

People panic sold because Irma

I commented elsewhere but when Florida stops, the world economy shudders. I can guarantee you people were panic selling before the storm hit to get more cash because no one knew when the electricity would be back on, able to work, banks open, gas stations open. When the power is out Bitcoin doesn't work too well. And when you can't get to a bank or working ATM you may need more cash on hand than usual. The days before Irma hit (all last week before Friday) I saw the price dropping rapidly to $4100. The big banks are a problem but not every market dip is some government or big bank conspiracy. Tack this on to what Harvey did in Texas and the effects on gas prices and you can pin a lot of the current market activity on natural disasters. And it's still hurricane season for another few months so keep a close eye on it.

It's Irma you morons

Probably not a world currency by any means but the network or ideas pioneered with bitcoin being integral to consumer finance ala visa/MasterCard of the 60s? Absolutely

The original Tesla they featured was a piece of shit compared to a current day Model S. It’s a show about performance cars not concessions about experimental toy cars.

It’s still not a discount until it’s at or below $200

You don’t understand what he’s saying about a pyramid? When you continue to buy in, regardless of the price, others who are selling (primarily in downward market trends) are making money off of you. Bitcoin isn’t a pyramid scheme itself, but buying like that is how a pyramid scheme works.

In no point in your rambling, in-coherent statement did you make any sense, or make a statement of any validity. "Palestine" is the name given to The Land of Israel by the Greeks. The 12 tribes of Israel originated there. Pagan Arab nomads occupied the lands, and the Ottoman Empire and British Empire later on. While the then-Islamic Arabs occupied some land, there was a Jewish migration back to their homeland. This intensified in the 30s and 40s as the German holocaust proceeded, and simultaneously Jews were removed from their homes and stripped of their belongings in places like Egypt, Iraq and Jordan. The UN in 1948 (without the UK's opinion) decided on the partition of The Land of Israel (aka British controlled Mandatory Palestine) would have, with Israel and Palestine being separate states and Jerusalem being an independent city-state. The day after the resolution was passed in 1948, the Muslims attacked.
