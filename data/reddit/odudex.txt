Bitcoin is "legalness".

I am not a skilled programmer too. I'm more a hardware guy. But python is very intuitive, so I encourage you starting with something like a Udemy course and learn this great tool.

Didn't saw the details, but just reading the link there is something wrong. ABS is NOT food safe since it contains styrene. Look for POM. If you are going serious on this, there are good branded sensors with no moving parts that are safer and last longer

The beer was highly carbonated (too much CO2), so we had to adjust the faucet this slow to avoid foam during regular pouring. We also need more practice in tuning the faucet, gas pressure, etc

This was just a demonstration of already available pieces of technology put together. The plan was inspire people to create their own machines.
To make a auto pour system would be as easy as replace the faucet for an "always opened" one. The problem with auto is people wouldn't be able to choose the foam proportion in their pints, and as we saw in the post discussion, that is polemic. Some people, including myself, enjoy the pouring ritual.
ID checking would be a very complex task, probably needing vision, face recognition, gov. data, AI,privacy issues, etc. So I believe it is not viable now, meaning someone who offers this kind of service would always be responsible for monitoring and controlling access to it.

No, we did get drunk��.
The beer was a "session IPA", produced in town, good for drinking in hot days we are having here in South of Brazil. The net was the mainnet.

If someone wants to make something like this public available, it should be constantly monitored or be somewhere were only adults are allowed in.

It's because it uses lightning network. It is almost instantaneous and has no fees

The beer is cooled by the machine right before the faucet. I believe we could have increased the flow a little, but it was working like this and we focused on drinking.
If you pay attention, the foam seen in the movie was intentionally created by the user, who decided to push the lever to the "foam position" at a certain moment.
It was our first time playing with beer keg, gas, etc. Probably next time we will pour better pints

For now I just wanted to share the project results and ideas and maybe help people build their own machines. Everyone is free to use them, commercially or not.

Thanks u/WrongHash for providing lightning payment server and u/RoninDH for joining the project

MIT Tech Review has nothing to do with tech reviews. It is just a group of frustrated left guys. It's hard to believe they really are from MIT, also hard to believe how MIT allow some much bullshit written in its name.
