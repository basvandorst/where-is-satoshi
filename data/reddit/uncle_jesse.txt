Quite honestly, I'm rather depressed at the number of downvotes I'm seeing on this idea. No vote would be fine, but seriously, downvotes? Is the Bitcoin community really that much behind government-controlled healthcare? That seems against the entire principle of Bitcoin. The potential of this idea is one that can drastically change the entire world - think poor nations where not even the government can afford healthcare. This isn't a political post, but one intended to provide a solution to healthcare worldwide! I'm disappointed at those clicking downvote - if you clicked it, why?

I mean the fact that government is needed at all to provide healthcare is a problem. What if technology similar to Devcoin instead paid the Doctors wanting to participate, allowing government to lower taxes as a result? This isn't just a US issue - it would solve worldwide healthcare problems.

I don't think it needs to be silk road - it just needs to have payment built into the protocol so as coins are mined, Doctors get paid. There are obviously other systems that would need to be in place to track Doctor expenses, etc. (or we just rely a trust scale of some sort to pay trustworthy Doctors that are honest).

So if I only want to mine for one or two people out of my house, I still have to apply for a money transmitters license? I'd love to see more clarification on that - this just made life a lot harder for me, and I'm only mining for a few close family and friends.

Technically this isn't begging. I'm just sharing that my son is accepting Bitcoin as he raises money for camp :-) I'm just sharing what he's doing, not begging. No one needs to donate.

Currently with precious minerals mined from the ground, those are not taxable (as far as I'm aware). Does bitcoin and altcoin that is mined fit within this category? How taxable is mined bitcoin?

Interesting - still seems very unclear to me. Setting up a corporation seems like a lot of work for only a few close family and friends wanting a single individual to mine on their behalf (and that individual benefiting from the relationship in a percentage of the returns).

Yeah, like they did for Wall Street or the US Auto industry. If I had the choice of picking technology or government to make my life-altering decisions for me, I choose technology any day.

I haven't quite worked out the storage scenario yet - perhaps a complimentary network similar to bittorrent could handle some of that. Or, bitcoin keys replace DNS (a colored coin could store the domain name of the key, and browsers would look to find the key in the block chain that corresponds with the domain name). The idea here is that it's not necessarily bitcoin that may solve it. It's the philosophy behind bitcoin that makes other similar types of networks possible. This could be a complimentary network to bitcoin, and has its own chain of sorts. That's why I'm calling it just "The Chain" and not the blockchain - the power of Bitcoin is in the massive public blockchain that proves every transaction. Other networks could provide different functionality, but work on a similar public chain.

Because Bittorrent doesn't have a way to authenticate ownership like Bitcoin does. I couldn't verify with 100% authenticity that you owned a domain name, for instance, with Bittorrent. Bittorrent *could* provide a storage layer on top of all this, though.
