I'd rather not disclose that information publicly, but I feel I am on pace but still am pushing hard to make sure I get over the 1000 signatures threshold to allow for disqualified signatures, etc.

Can you explain why you call capitalism a program for authoritarianism?
The free market capitalism allows for voluntary interaction, association, and exchange. You are not going to exchange something for something else if you feel you are not going to benefit better from the item that you received than the item that you exchanged, whether that is currency or barter. Free market capitalism allows for people, whether the provider of a service or item or the purchaser, to exchange without coercion. You are not forced to buy or pay tribute or follow some restraining regulation. The corporations cannot write the regulations because there are no regulations. Where you have monopoly on power, you attract bad agents to seek that power.

Thank you! I think I may look into accepting Dogecoin and Litecoin.

With my magic wand I would replace it with nothing. I think that competing physical currencies and of course cryptocurrencies and allow for the market to regulate itself. If you are a believer in cryptocurrencies, this is what you want to see.

Thank you for your well thought out response. I have to go to bed as I have to get up early for an event tomorrow. I will try to come back tomorrow when I get home to respond more adequately. 
But just as a quick response, when I refer to devaluation I am referring to in comparison to commodities. Your purchasing power is diminished, you can't buy the same groceries or gas with the same amount of money. The Great Depression is actually an example of why regulation and the Fed causes more trouble than good. They prolonged it. You can look to the Depression of 1920 to see the contrast. It will sharp but over in less than two years. Now compare and contrast that to the Great Depression, over a decade.

There are many reasons why I want or think that the Federal Reserve needs to be audited and eventually abolished. The Federal Reserve has devalued our currency, it allows for the government to run such huge deficits, QE and other policies are reckless and are just creating bubbles that we will have to deal with down the road, etc.

I think you should research voluntarism a bit more.

Yes, I have been employed since then. I have no desire to play politician. You should research libertarianism, it's pretty straight forward. I do not believe in aggression or coercion. The only people who make a mockery of the process are the people in the two party system. That is the joke, you have no choice and everything done is not out of principle but deals, favors, and cronyism.

I don't think I have met a voluntarist that was a socialist, most identifying as ancap, free market anarchist, libertarian, agorist, and maybe mutualist.

You're welcome, and thank you. What district are you located in, if you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:18:37
In my district there is no Democrat running in opposition to Goodlatte (Republican). So, I think this is a good year to challenge Goodlatte. There is a lot of anti-Goodlatte sentiment in the district and couple that with privacy issues, our foreign policy, marijuana becoming less taboo and more accepted... I think this is a good election year to beat Goodlatte. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:16:37
I do not support any tax.

I have volunteer petitioners throughout the district, so it just depends where you are. I do have my petition available for download on my website [ I would love some help getting signatures if you are interested in printing that petition out and getting your friends and family to sign. You can PM me if you need more information or tell me where you live in the district.

I understand he is a character and I am sorry you think it's childish. I am not fresh out of college, I graduated in 2009. I haven't gotten headshots, as I am not focusing on the superficial and sizzle of politics, I am trying to get on the ballot first. I didn't take an intro to econ, I majored in it. Not that it makes me an expert, but I am economic literate and competent. I want to run for Congress because I want to help further the cause of liberty in anyway that I can. In Virginia, the Libertarian Party is making a real push to get on the ballot in every district, as well as US Senate (Robert Sarvis). I have been active in politics and have started a few clubs. Why must I be a lawyer or business owner to run for office? Not that there is anything wrong with those occupations, I would love to start my own business and it is definitely a goal of mine. Are you not a principled person? I'd rather have someone who is principled than someone who is well off and just plays politics as usual. 
I want to change the two party system, it doesn't give us much of a choice. I want to reduce the size and scope of government, I do not believe in coercion or aggression. $180,000 is a lot, not going to lie. But, if elected, I would love to get the pay reduced. Not that that is where your elected officials get rich, they get rich with favors and deals because of their power. I have no special interest except to further the cause of liberty.

I am sorry you do not believe me, but I also did not make any promises other than standing by my principles and fighting the corrupt system. I have no delusion that one man can make good on a promise to enact or repeal legislation single handedly.

I apologize for the grammatical error on that page, it will be fixed when I get home tonight. As I stated above, please do not mind my issue pages, as they are not in depth, etc. I am focusing on getting on the ballot by collecting signatures, as VA has some of the worst ballot access in the US. The Libertarian Party is not an official party in Virginia, so I have to get signatures and do not get a pass just by getting my party's nomination, like the Democrats and Republicans. What is wrong with Ron Swanson?

I would love to see the Fed abolished. If elected, I will work on making progress towards that end goal. Auditing the Fed would be a start, but I hope not the end.

Net Neutrality is a complex issue. Where on one hand I do not believe that ISP should be able to make a slow lane or throttle, I do not believe that they should be corrected in how they provide service. With that said, if we had a truly free market with ISP and cable companies, we probably wouldn't have to worry about this because you would have competitors that would sprout up or one of the companies that exists would see the demand to keep the internet open, free, and not hindered. The issue is that they are granted monopolies by governments so that you do not get competition.

I consider myself a voluntarist. I think that agorism is definitely a great means to change and minimizing government but see merit in politics as well. Having a soap box to talk about liberty oriented issues and solutions and make statements will hopefully bring more people to the mindset and bring about some change.
