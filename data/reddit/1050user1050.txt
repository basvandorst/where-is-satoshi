Total bummer. The only thing this offers me (right now) is the analytics stuff which is basically pointless since lawnmower isn't the only way I purchase btc. Hope someone fills the void they just left. The 'set it and forget it' aspect combined with the ability to use the multiplier for 'bullish' or 'bearish' outlooks worked great for me. :(

Just curious, are you joking or why would you want that? I'll give you one of my qr codes if it makes you feel safer, haha.

I don't think he was saying it is ok, he just means the problem already exists with cash, it is not a new or unique issue. 
It could probably be argued that cash is actually harder to trace than bits.

I bet they would knock some off the price to put their own qr on it. :)

It doesn't sound like any reason to worry if your electrum wallet is showing the transaction as pending. Might take a bit, but it sounds like it is on its way :)

It could use a little work for mobile. Looks pretty good otherwise! 
It is simple enough that you could probably get away with just a few media queries in the css. Some framework like twitter's bootstrap would work well for something like this design.

Fastest would probably be localbitcoins and you could probably get a little extra out of it selling that way
Otherwise you need to get a bank account hooked up to a site like coinbase but I'd be careful with that route - they are known to ban accounts that have btc coming or going between less-than-100%-legal avenues.
