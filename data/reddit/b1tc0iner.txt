I have recently signed up to bitcointrader and was thinking about depositing some bitcoins, but now i've had some more time to think about it I think you might be right.
It is blatently a scam.

This article raises some valid points which to be honest I completely agree with.
Take a step back and just think about it for a second. Don't get sucked into the hype like I almost did.

Trust me I understand the mining process. Can you not see how it's going change very soon? It's already way to expensive for anyone to mine using their own hardware, where as 2 years ago this was possible.
There will become a day where the mining of bitcoin can only be done by wealthy orginsizations or herds of botnets?
This is why you see the likes of StorJ spring up, they can see what's down the line.

Simple! Don't store your wallet on your computer, you are less likely to become a target. Check out blockchain.info

Please can you explain to me how you came to that conclusion?
I bet you only read the title. Try reading articles with an open mind, you might actually learn something!

I would personally print off my cold storage key and keep it safe somewhere in my house. That is the safest way as it's completely offline.

Incomprehensible Gibberish? 
I would say we're at stage 7:
1. New crypto-coins cryptocurrency is developed allowing the creator and his friends to easily mine approx 1/3rd of the total potential supply before going public.
2. Holders of crypto-coins agree to withhold their supply from the market before it goes public.
3. Start to promote the cryptocurrency by handing out free coins to the media, with likes of Max Keiser at the top of the list to start pumping.
4. Crypto-coins start trading and immediately jump in price due to limited supply.
5. Illiquid crypto-coins have a high market capitalisation due to a high price and number of coins (not) in circulation which encourages more media exposure and interest.
6. Many fools jump on the bandwagon buying expensive hardware to mine crapto-coins given the high price per crapto-coins (over 90% of mined supply with-held from market).
7. Many websites appear that add the tag exchanges to them to give the air of authority that suck in entrants by producing graphs and data that gives the illusion of rising prices and volume of trading when in reality they are nothing more than Ponzi scams as they limit withdrawals.
8. As interest and prices continue to rise, the creator and his friends slowly offload supply onto the fools until the price crashes and the noobs have been bled dry or holdings vaporise MTGox style.
9. The crapto-coins hoarders wait for the dust to settle and noobs to be encouraged once more into buying as the price is stable and then repeat the dump and crash several times more.
