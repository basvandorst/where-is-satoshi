Leancy is a HYIP(High Yield Investment Program)
on the internet has always been a risky deal. but with the introduction 
of bitcoin, it also became easier.
Easier to get paid FAST!
How Does It Work:
Leancy -  works this way:
you put in at least 10USD (Money transfer or bitcoin) and it give you back 2-5 PRECENT PER DAY!
yes, per day!
* Earn 5% a day on your bitcoinsBTC or other deposits.
* You can redeposit with interst whenever you want to let it compound.
* You can witgdraw your accued interst at any time, instantly!
* You can invest anywhere from 10$ to 200,000$ and of course from 0.01BTC to 10000BTC
*the more you invest the higher of a multiple you can get of the daily interest rate. so really you can get over 5%.
*Beware! 
here is my warning. a site like this may not last long its been working for 2 months and may last 2 years but not for years to come. be safe. get your initial invesment out, and never put in money that you can not afford to lose!
but... Good HYIP programs can last even 2 years.
and this one has good support and community and started 2 months ago. its just in the starting period and you can make a lot of $$ in the next months so you will not care
what happens a year from now!
if you deposit say 1000$ (minimum is 10$) and withdraw and reinvest your daily profit, after 60 days thats 27,0000$ and 1800$ daily!!
or you can invest 1000$ and after about 2 weeks get your earnings and from then you can play with no risk!
you can look at it as a gamble.
zeek rewards lasted more then a year.
in that time people made they bought houses with it. 
as well as banners brokers which lasted more then a year and a half.
leancy is 2 months old, and it has great potential the site looks professional and they have support and the is no problems with transections.
if it lasts 1 year from now , and you go in , by the time it will reach 1 year... well you do the math  Wink

to tell you the truth , i dont care, i dont care what they invest in or not.
if i can start today and it will stay on after 2 weeks i get the invesment back, from that moment the longer it will stay the more you will make. 
as i said before 
you can look at it as a gamble. zeek rewards lasted more then a year. in that time people made they bought houses with it. as well as banners brokers which lasted more then a year and a half.
