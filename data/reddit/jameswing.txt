Edit: As promised, numbers! And [source](




BTC is currently barely 1% of Overstock sales, but still 3x more than they expected, and BTC users spend 50% above avg. - so it's all about perspective. Also, for WTF? value:


Electronics I expected, but linens?

[This article]( adds that it's still triple their expected BTC sales, and BTC users spend 50% more than avg. buyer. I'd be curious how that stacks against other non-USD sales.

What is a "paper wallet"?

If/when BTC becomes a power currency, I'm afraid seizures/confiscations will continue to be the norm, with auctions and timing manipulated to keep at least a partial hold on the market. 
(plug here), property seizures are becoming old hat, with the US Government needing little to no reason, nor evidence. 
As we try to break away, I imagine they will only grip tighter.

From what I understand (disclaimer: which isn't much)
He acknowledges he was the person associated with that user account. The trial will debate whether there is enough evidence that what he/that account did was actually conspiracy, and whatever, etc.

It started as a gimmick, you know like: *It's the game show where we give you the answers, and you give us the questions!* to set it apart when game shows were a dime a dozen, but it's been around for so long now they don't need a gimmick, but its become part of what *Jeopardy!* is as a show. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:29:05
Still sounds like more sales than they *were* getting.
Edit: Nothing in business that makes *more* money is a terrible failure, or even a failure at all. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 16:04:25
Nice! That's actually super cool that they poured resources into fitting the area.
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:21:37
Except restaurants and credit cards are both extremely well-known concepts, so it makes no sense to promote concept name over brand.

Actually I got to visit the Bureau once. It was really interesting. "Mint" was just easier to say than "Bureau of Engraving and Printing" and I (wrongly, I suppose) thought it communicated my point just as well.
Also, differential equation modelling have little to do with US Cabinet Depts. So actually you can know how to math, and not know how to history.

I mean if Bitcoin sales are only down 90%, then that means the 10% of Bitcoin sales remaining after launch is still more than what they had pre-launch...
I shall update with numbers, and commence Googling.
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:09:08
They will though. Enough small players had to dip into savings to buy gifts, so lots of selling drove the price down. But buy if you can, it will bounce back. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:16:29
Ahh. Then that makes sense. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:12:44
....but today is not that day!
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:08:41
I do have basic network security down, thankfully. I'd prefer using on online service but I may actually have an old laptop I could dedicate to something like this. How does storing the machine keep the actual currency safe, if it exists digitally?
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:02:07
Oh shit TIL. Every headline about the incident andmade me wonder what the fuck kind of name is "Mt. Gox"
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:46:04
I would love to own one whole fucking percent of any currency. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:21:39
Gox is a mountain now? 
Must be of gold.

And this is a post about what now?
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:24:57
I agree with you on all points you mentioned, but 90% of voting Texans don't give a damn about those issues. What's your stance on:
Gun rights
Health care
Edit: Of course it's generalizing, that's how people get votes, prioritizing issues. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:07:26
I figure Mircosoft's recent announcement would've had some impact
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:25:53
Then how did they sell?
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:15:33
Surrounding area? Also, as an avid fan, I heartily approve of your explanation. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:20:07
One word makes a hell of a difference. 
I did have sexual relations with that woman. 
I am a crook. 
Frankly, my dear, I give a damn. 
Do you feel, punk?
A long time ago, in a galaxy far away. 
See? They all look wrong.

Hm? The US Mint solely controls dollar production... I could write you a flow rate equation detailing how much capital and yearly income it would take to maintain control of the value of 1% of all US dollar bills.

The [game thread]( over at was full of references and hat tips to bitcoin - it made me happy.
edit: heheh tips.
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:06:38
Why do you need a dedicated machine to "store" bitcoins? Can't you just buy them online through services like Coinbase?
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:54:59
***Woah what just happened here?!?111!!!oneoneone!!***
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:41:47
So using a service is really not that different from government currency banking. 
How do you "buy" bitcoins and transfer them to something like a laptop if not thru a service?
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:26:02
 ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
@_date: 2014-08-28 21:08:56
Well I'm only referring to the paper dollars so that's settled.
Sure 1% of the US Gold reserves would be sweet too, but that's not at all what my original point was...
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:25:42
I'm assuming a little, because that's about as cheap as you can buy a new suit
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:36:00
Wait just like that? Shit....So why are none of us rich liars off of Bitcoin yet? 
On a side note, it would be cool for PayPal to setup a separate BTC exchant with verifiable purchases, but at that point, there's Coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:49:21
Hey, holy shit, I know how I know you now.
Anyways, I can see that being good and bad. I prefer the anonymity of reddit as it stands.
Your point about Unidan is valid, but it's the crowd psychology Reddit is horrifyingly susceptible to. And this very very very heavily influenced by the admins, and the powers that be at Reddit, Inc.
Annnnnd from what I've seen, subs are very successful at accomplishing things you and OP talk about - because they have a loosely binding commonality, and usually a common goal. 
Reddit's chaos is reflection of its user base. So rather than play to win, as a business, they must play constantly to "not lose" - if that makes sense 
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:28:00
They bind people enough to accomplish tasks...for example has organized mass donations to certain charities/causes a number of times. 
And I suppose, but there are lots of things for that, and I don't think most people see Reddit as one of those things.
Edit: Oh, and you can add friends. Never done it myself though, prefer the anonymity.  
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:13:30
How does the first clause of that sentence logically imply the second...?
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:09:48
True, but by simply putting $ and not even USD or something, I was assuming US currency. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:42:43
Fucking nihilists. 
Say what you will about the tenets of national socialism dude, at least it's an ethos.

This is a great conceptual explanation with 0 technical details on how the mining aspect actually works. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:23:23
Cool now I can sign into Chrome as people I don't know and post to their Facebook....I don't get what this is trying to prove. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:49:55
How much was the coin? 
1 BTC at the time, however unlikely, would be cool. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:40:14
Well, it's up to $300 for the first time since before Christmas I believe. 
Edit: FUCK. Sorry guys. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:22:58
I use both, and don't understand what you mean, could you explain?
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:39:33
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:34:33
Yep! Someone elsewhere mentioned they stepped in when Paypal et al backed off WL
