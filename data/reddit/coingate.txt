Our invoices display all transactions received to the invoice address. The invoice displays if the amount is overpaid or underpaid immediately once the transaction is detected on the blockchain. We are aware this is not an ideal situation and will introduce improvements (such as notifications to merchants) but since such cases are relatively rare this is not the highest priority at this time. Hopefully this will help to clarify how it works exactly!

We're adding more and more merchants to our payment gateway each day. If we look at the data of a past year, we can also see stable growth in using cryptocurrencies for payments online, and we're not talking only about Bitcoin. So, considering that we are in a very early adoption stage, the pace seems steady, and the idea of better payment rails remains strong. We are yet to see how it turns out.

We do not support bech32 addresses yet, as our platform is heavily dependent on bitcoind (bitcoin core), which has support only for legacy SegWit addresses at the moment. When bech32 address support is integrated into bitcoind, we will be able to process payouts to bech32 addresses as well.

We believe Steam discontinued accepting Bitcoin payments not just because of Bitpay's issues, but due to high customer costs as well as issues such confirmation times and underpayments. On a large volume scale, this may become quite tedious and support-demanding. As far as we know, Steam's average transaction size is relatively low, putting them not in an ideal cost-benefit situation of accepting Bitcoin. As far as Lightning Network goes, we are really looking forward to that.

CoinGate does not *keep* the difference. Our refund system allows the customer to request a refund for the overpaid amount directly on the invoice (the merchant can do that also).

Firstly, we don't pay a $30 mining fee per transaction - typically. Secondly, small transactions might produce us a loss to spend them, but this is offset by fees earned from larger payments. So far, we are keeping things balanced and hope to stay that way.

 Accepting Bitcoin is beneficial to merchants in a few ways.
* **No chargebacks.** Merchants that accept cryptocurrencies don’t have to worry about fraudulent chargebacks as transactions on the blockchain are irreversible. It can save some headaches when you know exactly when your order is paid and ready to be shipped.
* **Lower fees.** Credit card payment providers charge merchants 3% fee and more for each payment. Crypto payment providers charge significantly less and can convert those received coins to fiat and send to the bank account, so it’s a good opportunity to save some money for the business.
* **Wider customer base.** Why accept cash only when you can accept more currencies? It only broadens your chances to attract more customers that are willing to spend cryptocurrencies rather than fiat.
* **New marketing opportunity.** Telling people that you accept crypto might boost your sales in no time.
For now, these are the main reasons why businesses should consider accepting digital currency payments. Especially when there are payment processors who will convert everything to fiat if that’s what you prefer. Integration itself is smooth and don’t require any programming skills.
Check out [CoinGate]( if that’s something you would like to consider.

@_date: 2018-03-27 22:43:45
We appreciate your point and an ideological standpoint, but you're failing to see the broader picture. Good luck getting your everyday store run a Bitcoin node and keep the bitcoins - very few want to do that, and even fewer are capable of doing so. If you think a bigger business wants to deal with a 60% downswing in 3 months - you're missing something once again. Our goal is to get merchants to give cryptocurrencies a try, and we make that choice simpler by offering automation, security, and settlements directly to their bank accounts; no risk, no confusion. At the same time, we're expanding the range of stores where people can actually pay with Bitcoin. If a merchant falls in love with BTC and educates oneself to actually run a node - it's a win for us and we're happy to say farewell. Labelling us an intermediary is fine, as long as you can acknowledge we are also enablers and facilitators. If you cannot appreciate that, you're free to stick to ideology and keep transacting "peer-to-peer".
Edit: In your review, you made a mistake: we do not just settle in Euros, we offer merchants Bitcoin payouts, too. This can be set up when installing our ecommerce plugins, payment buttons, or API. The majority of our volume goes to merchants who keep BTC (roughly 60/40 split).

Sorry, but that would not be fair to other contenders who might not be reading this thread. In case the challenge is unsolved for several more hours, we will post some hints on the challenge page.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:14:02
The challenges are live!

Congratulations! We will publish the solutions to all of the challenges soon!

Do you have any feedback you could give on what you think about this competition, and if you have any suggestions on how we could improve it in the future? In your opinion, would it be better for us to publish 1 harder challenge, or several easier ones?

We have used Electrum wallet to generate / recreate the seed using BIP0039, so most likely your Mycelium wallet used a different BIP to generate the seed, that's why it did not work in Mycelium.
Thank you for participating, and we hope you will be able to win next time!

Challenge  has been solved! Challenge  and  still remaining.

Challenges will be of varying difficulty. Simple challenges that don't require any thinking wouldn't really be challenges, or would they? :)

You can buy Bitcoin on crypto exchanges like Binance or Kraken, or at companies like CoinGate that work more like a brokerage. This way, you can purchase cryptocurrencies with credit card, mobile balance, bank transfer, Skrill account and using other methods, supported in most parts of the world.

We do not give want to a hint on how to solve it just yet, but seeing as it has not been solved yet, we can say that wallet seeds are not related to this challenge.

All the challenges have been solved now, so here are the solutions:
Challenge  The letter "I" in all 8 logos had a slightly different shade - the blue channel of the RGB value was slightly different in each letter (while the red and green channels has the same value). The values, if measured in any photo editing program, were: 84, 69, 80, 65, 83, 90, 86, 57. Converted to ASCII (using HTML / decimal representation) it was: T, E, P, A, S, Z, V, 9.
In the bottom right corner of the picture, there was a hidden note, written by slightly changing the color values, so they were not perfectly white ( instead of  It was not possible to see with human eye, but possible to detect by changing the color of the background using a "fill" function, with zero "tolerance" level, so only the exact color matches would be changed. The note said "pastebin.com".
Adding these 2 parts, you had to go to  and find a private key written there.
Challenge  The answer to each question was a number from 1 to 2048. After correctly answering all questions, you had to use the world list from BIP0039 to generate a wallet from a seed: 
The answers were: 2008, 50, 2011, 170, 10, 2, 256, 2012, 342, 12, 185, 659. These numbers matched the words: wife alert win benefit abuse ability cable window click accident blade false.
Challenge  The spaces in the text encoded a binary string, where 1 space was equal to "0", and 2 spaces were equal to "1". Converting the binary string to decimal, gave you the private key.
The binary string was: 01001100001100010100110101101111010010100101001101110101011110010110111001010110010001000100110101001000011010010011001101000111001101010111011101101000010000110111000001101111011110000101001000110110010001000101011001010010010001010111101001100110011011010101000001100100011100000111101001100010010000100100011001100011010000100110111101101101011101110101001101100101011000100110101000110100011110010110101001010001

We are sorry to hear you had a bad experience with us.
2FA prevents the user's account from being accessed if the user's e-mail is compromised. We cannot remove 2FA just by the user requesting it from their e-mail or their account dashboard, as that would make 2FA meaningless. Therefore, we have strict procedures on how and when 2FA can be removed, which includes answering a list of questions regarding your account activity. After being asked to answer our questions, you refused to do it 4 times, creating new support tickets instead. On the 5th time of receiving the same questions from us, you agreed to answer them, but were not able to provide sufficient answers. As an alternative, we requested you to upload a specific file (or add a specific HTML tag) to your website (to prove you have control over the website) or to re-upload documents which you have previously uploaded to CoinGate for verification - you have refused to do any of those things.
As a final decision, your 2FA will not be removed until you complete enhanced KYC procedures to ensure the safety of the account and the funds.
Please refer to reply from our support for more details.
