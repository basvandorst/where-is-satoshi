The advantage for the big players will be **magnitudes** smaller if it is Nvidia and AMD trying to monopolize on a ASIC-resistant coin compared to KnC mining with a new 3x times better chips.
 Big market ASIC development will offer massive improvements with each generation giving the chipmakers defacto monopoly on money. They decide when rest of the world gets the money printers after they have used them for the exclusive pre-release 3 month "testing".
In GPU/CPU all the major advancements have been made. Progress is slowing down and even if you dont happen to own *the latest* generation,**in the GPU world, with 1 chip generation behind you are max 20 percent performance-wise behind, often even less**. GPUs are so widespread and accessible, many more people can get involved, both the big, the small and the in-betweens.
Compare that to the ASIC market where each generation pushes its predecessors out.

Wake up to the real world guided by gains and risks, not by unfounded promises. 
Do you have the promise somewhere in a contract that you can use in a court? No? So that promise relies on them being kind? What are you? A visitor from FairFairyWorld?

The *Algorithm* may not be immune. True enough, if scrypt-N gets Litecoin-scale ( which might very well get), a bold hardware company might attempt to make an ASIC. One could also argue that it even does not matter that the N changes once in a while, by then a new generation of ASICs could be out and ready. 
**However, they would have to be sure the coins developers will not hardfork in the middle of the development process**([post from webbs from Vertcoin development]( 
Attempting to build a Vertcoin ASIC is the single best way to help the coin, since it will get the chance to knockout the ASIC right before its release and make a very strong statement.
