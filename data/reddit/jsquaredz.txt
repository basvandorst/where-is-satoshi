A couple years later...
125,000BTC = $1!!!  Absolutely Insane!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:38
Yes.  Someone else is scared.  &lt;/question answered&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:47
Not sure about that, but drawing that conclusion makes no logical sense.

There are always two sides to a transaction. A buyer and a seller.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:24
Umm. No... Because I sold it before it bursts.

True dat. I can’t complain. I bought it at 200 and sold at 4500. Bought some back at 10k so I’m up again even though I don’t have very much anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:31
Well it was at 4500 dollars from 200, over 2000 percent gain. Once I sold it went up fast. A week later it was at 7000.  Can’t complain too much about making 8600 on a 400 dollar investment.

That’s exactly what I’m doing. It’s just humor that’s so dry and clever you have to be dead and in heaven redditing to even understand. ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:15:40
So you can always sell the amount to get your original investment back out. This way you’re playing with the house’s money so to speak. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:50
That’s the mistake I made when it hit 4500.

Hodl your horses meow.

Were your awarded bitcoins lost too, or did you take them with you?
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:39:48
I would think Apple would do the transaction themselves and take a fee, or someone else(coinbase) would cut them in on the transaction fee, just like a credit card processor.

Hopefully one of you FreeBSD or developer types, can help with this. I would like to see a bitcoin core plugin for frenas. This would make it easy for a free as user to decide to help the BC effort by participating as a full node. One click install is key. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:08:27
Cool.  I would like to see the prices in Bitcoin next to dollars though. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 20:57:46
I know they could but I think it would be pointless to duplicate this since there is nobody else that owns Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:39:00
I see what you mean.  Will repost. I don't think I can edit the title at this point. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 20:14:28
I see Apple being the exchange rather than owning the currency. Nobody would want a centrally controlled currency. That's opposite of why Bitcoin is successful. 
Apple could just set a transaction fee, and have the largest Bitcoin exchange. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 07:26:58
250 actually. Holy smokes. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:12:49
This is actually already in the ports tree for FreeBSD.  I just did this Node in freeness by:
1. Create a jail
2. run pkg update
3. run pkg upgrade
4. run pkg install bitcoin
5. run pkg bitcoin-daemon
6. Setup per 
6. type bitcoin -daemon into the shell to start the Daemon.  
7. Open up port 8333 from your firewall to the Jail's IP address.
I immediately saw 80Mbits down going to the jail as it started downloading the blockchain.
Then just configure it to autostart the service in rc.d

Maybe the money would be stored in the Apple wallet on your phone, and backed up by iCloud. Support like this would mainstream Bitcoin overnight. I'm sure that the credit card companies making deals with Apple have put conditions to prevent this. Would be cool one day to see something priced in Bitcoin rather than always being priced at time of sale against exchange of a traditional currency like dollar or euro.

Please tell me you're writing a tell all book. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:03:55
&lt;private&gt;Shh... Don't blow my cover. I'm trying to get some good ideas. &lt;/private&gt;
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:01:02
What's canceling them do for the people that had them? If they were cancel able that to me would be the death of Bitcoin. The whole point of them having value is that they are scarce, immutable and peer to peer transferable. At least thats how I see it. I must admit though it's still early days of me trying to grok Bitcoin.
