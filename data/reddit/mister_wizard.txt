Move small amounts to different wallets and sell that way.  No way to prove you didn't buy it from some other shady individual.

I use them and am in the states, can vouch for the service.  We use it for our site and sell merch and accept bitcoin.  I also personally use it as well, no problems so far and quick turn around.

whoa, how have i not noticed that they have an account here?  I might have swayed over to them and set up shop with them if i knew i could use reddit as another platform to communicate with someone there.  Maybe i still will....thats what makes this so awesome, i can do it and not worry about stupid termination fees like you would a bank.

A friend and i run a tshirt company and are considering doing this as well.  Any tips you can give us on starting this and going down this path?

I just read the FAQ on that site and it made my head hurt a little.  Im not even much of a gambler but now i am interested in how this works, just to understand it i guess.

Nice, are you using coinbase or bitpay?  I notice you mention coinbase on your site is why i ask.  The company i work with [Only Ones NYC]( just started accepting bitcoin using coinbase and we are just getting used to it.  Since we use bigcartel for our shop site we had to take the bitcoin process to coinbase as a manual thing.

Been reading up about, can't say anything for sure but you can most likely direct your questions to as he made the site and seems to be pretty open about it and cool with talking on reddit about it.

What about macs and a local wallet?  I have one set up with a few cents basically and am curious.

I should also add, we intend to keep our money in bitcoin and not cash out really.  I know we may take a hit if the value drops, but this isnt a main source of income for us and we dont make much money at all anyway.  Actually....its more of a loss, we just enjoy it and dream.

Block chain removed the wallet functionality I believe
