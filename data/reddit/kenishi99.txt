They use Xapo as cold wallet? 
Seriously? 
From where did you get the information? 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:49:31
Thank you! 
What's so good about it? 
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:24:04
Nice to hear that. :) 
Yes, that's true. The most people only think about it like a simple transaction of a file, but that isn't the way how it works.
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:08:27
Now you know. :)
So you want to know it one day before I know it, huh? :P
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:51:14
I think it's because of the quote. There stands 365 days. :)

Hi This is not the same mail like the one I wrote about above. 
The post you've linked is about this mail here:

Don't ever lose your private key, dude! 
And don't store the heart on an exchange! 
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:40:51
I hope so, too. 
Still it's somehow scary... 
I'll let you know when my withdrawal came thru. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:15:54
RemindMe! 365 days "Bitcoin Price" 
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:40:54
I first thought that too, but they announced that yesterday. So when the price had gone up after that announcement I would understand it. But it begun two weeks ago...
Yeah, I think a difference of +/- 5% is normal, but... 
I'm comparing the price charts of the exchanges for a long time. It's the first time, I think, that Bitstamp is constantly higher than the other exchanges. It no longer varies. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:11:00
Agreed! 
Many... MANY people don't know that you actually can store your Bitcoins on your pc instead of an exchange. 
They see the exchange as a bank... 
A lot of my friends and my work colleagues didn't knew this, either.

Best cards you have is amazon.de and Google Play. Thanks!
Why did you choose the name pock(.io)? It's an interesting name for a gift cards website. Does it have a meaning?

My first withdrawal came thru after 9 hours. 
The other withdrawal (10 hours ago) didn't came thru yet. :/
What's happening? Withdrawals on Bitstamp took normally about 10-20mins...

Bitstamp didn't withdraw my Bitcoins yet. I made a withdraw request 3 hours ago. 
I think a lot people cashing out right now, normally it took about 10-20mins for a Bitcoin withdrawal... 
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:17:32

I don't think that they've been hacked. 
I'm on Bitstamp and didn't get a scam mail. My family (3 accounts) didn't get it, either.

Sadly that's true...
On Kraken there isn't that much volume. I hope that it'll change in the future!
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:02:03
Hey, I just came back from the future. It'll be 1873.647 for sure! 
Oh, and MtGox reopened (September) as a Bitcoin bank and got hacked (November) and all Bitcoins got stolen. But it was only 1.42 BTC since nobody trusted MtGox anymore.

It was funny when I first saw it on my mobile phone.

Did you do it high priority?
The fastest withdrawal / deposit I had is a high priority transfer.
At evening 23 o'clock I made a USD transfer to Bitstamp. Next day at 11 o'clock it arrived. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:58:31
That's amazing man! Good work! 
Let me know when you're done. :) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:51:46
Screenshots! 
No, to be serious: I already read that, that they're doing such things. But didn't know it was "that bad." ...
I'm a bit worried about my money in Bitstamp now. :/
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:24:19
Looks like they fixed it now. Wow!
@_date: 2014-05-24 18:21:38
Yeah, I knew that already. But still, when someone gets your secret password, they'll be able to withdraw easily... 
With 2FA it wouldn't be that easy. 
But still, good to know for people using Blockchain.info wallet. 
Btw. look over there: A donut! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:47:08
No problem. I have to thank you. :)
I hope you like my homemade donut. ;)

@_date: 2014-11-14 21:41:19
You should remind them about all the advantages of Bitcoin. I think that's more important than the price. 
I know some people who thought that Bitcoin is bad. When I asked them why, they told me "Look at the price! Bitcoin is dead." 
After having a short talk about Bitcoin and telling them about how Bitcoin works they're always impressed.
I think the main problem is that the people look at the price and not what Bitcoin is and how it works (which is more important).
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:26:24
I think it's still too early for that.
Many people still doesn't know what Bitcoin is. At least I've noticed it that way. 
And with such headlines people won't even read that article and already think: That's it with Bitcoins. 
Bitcoin boss is dead, the Bitcoin era is done.
But you're right, it's a good step forward to think like you wrote it. When they assume that people already should know about Bitcoin, than it's a good sign.
@_date: 2014-05-25 07:48:18
Awesome! 
Where did you find it? 
Did you make it? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:05:57
Ok, sorry for that. 
Mt.Gox was, is and will always be the worst Bitcoin company ever! 
I really can't imagine how they worked for such a long time...

Interesting is that the person didn't put any notes to their transaction. 
So basically they didn't even advertised for something...
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:27:59
The headline says: "Bitcoin boss found dead." 
That's just wrong!
Most people only read headlines. When they read that they'll understand that wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-25 07:41:14
Mine went thru, too. 
Good to know it worked for you, too. 
As you said it could have been a cold to hot wallet issue.

That's actually good news!

Like Visa or MasterCard, I'd like to be able to pay everywhere with my phone simply by using NFC. 
Sure, it' ll convert my Bitcoins to another currency first, but still I would be able to use my Bitcoins everywhere this way. 
I wouldn't need any credit cards anymore. 
**No yearly fees. No limits. No currency exchange and processing fees for paying abroad** *(which also means I wouldn't need to carry any other currencies with me)*.
Yeah, that would be a great thing!
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:38:12
Yeah... But that's not the way how it should work. 
I can't tell everyone to do it that way...

At least the "Getting started" page shouldn't be like that...

I'm interested, too. 
Is Blockchain.info really that secure?
How is it possible that they don't hold my private keys? 
But there's one thing...
One thing I don't like about the Blockchain.info wallet which is driving me crazy:
**Why don't they ask you for your 2FA when you're logged in and want to withdraw Bitcoins?**
@_date: 2014-11-16 12:32:05
Nice! Thanks and keep up your great work. 
Could you maybe build a filter so that I can filter all cards available only for my country? That would make the website absolutely perfect! 
And do you have a subreddit here? Or another social media site? Want to follow you for news or when you add new cards. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:54:28

@_date: 2015-01-16 23:02:32
Wait... It **was** possible to use the blockchain.info app when the service is offline. 
They somehow removed it with the new design update. 
But, why? 
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:37:34
WTF?! Why and how did he know it? 
@_date: 2014-11-16 15:58:53

But why are they doing this? To test the app on a small group of customers first?

To think about it like that is somehow funny! 
I'd like to get a quarter of a penny, I think it would make me laugh. :D
Anyway I understand you, thinking like this makes the tip somehow weird. 
But that's the reason why we're using bitcoin, right? So we don't have to cut a penny into a quarter to tip someone! :P
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:01:44
To be honest I don't see anything wrong here. It's a pretty bad crash and since there are that much traders on Bitstamp it's normal that Bitstamp takes the lead. 
As far as I can see after some minutes the other exchanges land on the same price.
 Am I wrong?

To be honest, I'm happy with it. I only copied a post and made it a little bit easier to understand/read. That's it. 
It's already generous that I got a tip for that at all. It's already more than a simple 'thank you'. :) 
It's better to tip people outside of this subreddit with greater amounts. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:35:42
Seriously, stop comparing Bitcoin with any other stock value or technology. It may look similar, but that doesn't mean it's the same. 
Noone knows what'll happen to Bitcoin and it's price. The only thing we know is what's happening at the moment: It's crashing.
