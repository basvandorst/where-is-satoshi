Now you've changed the subject and come full circle.  I wonder if I'm arguing with a troll, a provocateur, or if there is some fundamental law we don't agree on.  You mean to tell me he meant to say that it's OK for people to be 'dogmatist', 'zealot', and generally unreasonable? *C'mon now.*

Having more transactions per second does not require more mining. The amount of mining, and the amount of energy consumed by mining, is determined by the relative value of the block payout to the cost per block payout. Theoretically, at least.
And it's not like the current monetary system isn't a "disgusting waste of resources".

Best you can do is tell people to not send coins to that address, remember that it exists, and in a few months empty it.  I don't think people are that loose with their money where many will continue sending coin with no guarantee that it'll benefit anyone.

I wonder if rich people don't spend their money because doing so would devalue other rich peoples money.  Or would it?  People spending money would make the economy stronger, wouldn't it?  But if everyone had more money then the money would be worth less.  Or would it?  Because not everyone tied to the value of the USD is in america, where the money would be spread.  Other countries would get relatively poorer.  Wouldn't they?  
Is the system set in such a way that their exists a quantifiable amount of wealth, where one must suffer if another is to gain?  And is this otherwize immutable quantity of wealth set by humanity's scientific utility and infrastructure?
Nah.  It's just a random mess.

I think it is somewhat wrong that the Fed tries to keep an amount of inflation to promote investment.  What if I don't want to invest? Then you'll take/devalue my property? That doesn't sound like freedom of choice.

...did he say that bitcoin was stable?


Yea, your right.  Eric (OP) didn't say otherwise.


He does say this.


See, we're each looking at this through different lenses of bias.  To me, Eric is denouncing this guys claim that "Bitcoin is prone to swings because a central authority can’t issue more supply in times when demand for money soars" and especially "Fed has provided a fairly stable currency for 100 years and “passed the market test.”".  Yes, the dollar has been far more stable than bitcoin, but by no means does this guy have evidence to assert that the dollar is "stable", in an absolute sense, or that the fed has "passed the market test".  That's what I see.  And because of my bias, I gloss over the somewhat mistaken claim that the dollar isn't stable because it has lost value, etc, and value the valid parts of his writing. Bias in the other direction will be blind to the valid parts and transfixed on the flaws.  It's scary how we manipulate ourselves.

The article states that the premises are in complete compliance with all cleanliness rules and upon the previous inspection everything was fine.
Edit: Here's an excerpt: "As of now a health inspector and code enforcer are being paid every week to inspect the property and no violations have been reported; in fact in the latest report it was written that the property has remained clean and orderly and is not in violation of any laws."

These are the sorts of regulations that get in the way of international value exchange.  Each country is just trying to look out for itself.  And that's part of the problem.  It would benefit people as a whole if governments were to compete similar to how businesses do.  To this end, people should have the utmost freedom to move their property between countries.  Regulations against this freedom act as chains which keep peoples' property, and therefore the people themselves, bound to a monopolistic, self interested government.
Isn't it justified for a country to be self interested to the point of monopoly because if the country falters it would harm so many of its citizens?  Well, people would not be so highly impacted if countries were not so integral in peoples stores of value (ehem, national currencies) and it were easy for people to leave.
Of course, law-chained-property is not the only obstacle a person faces when they wish to move from place to place.  The other barriers are more human.  Family, homeland, patriotism, comfort of the familiar.  Personally, I've never been one to care for these ties, but I understand those that do.
Technology, like bitcoin, is making these inevitably human bonds easier to cope with.  Video and voice chat is another great example.  Hell, if everyone had access to a teleporter none of those would be a problem.  Miss Ma?  Zap.  Hi Ma!
For what is a government but a service to it's people?  And what is freedom but the ability to choose your service?

You bring up a good point with ask/bid differences.  For sellers I don't think this is a problem.  I was under the assumption that the spread cost is passed onto the buyer because the coinbase/bitpay app uses the sell price of bitcoin in calculating how much bitcoin the user is asked to send.  
Though it's a little fuzzier what this means for donations where the donors can use varying sources for bitcoin prices, if they decide to consult the price at all.

1 bitcoin = 1,000 millibitcoin = 1,000,000 microbitcoin = 1,000,000 bits = 100,000,000 satoshi
100 satoshi = 1 bit
1,000 bit = 1 millibitcoin
and of course 1,000 millibitcoin = 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:30:12
You're right, a one world government wouldn't be good.  A world of governments that compete similar to how businesses do could be good.  And bitcoin helps to level the international monetary regulation that restricts this competition.

I agree again!  At least with your statements, not your conclusion.
While there hasn't been major change in the launch system, there has been plenty of minor changes to improve efficiency.  And there is more to getting to space and making a space trip useful than the rocket itself.  There are many auxiliary, but completely necessary, technologies and know-how required to have humans exist in space or to have unmanned missions prove productive.  And by simply having a precedence on all of these things on which to improve, the private companies are helped.
