Really feel like some people here are missing the point. 
Inflation = predictable loss. (some might even say theft)
Psychologically, inflation turns money from a store of value into a depreciating asset. 
Not value to be saved in an effort to create wealth, but a consumable with incentive to dispatch as quickly as possible.
Ultimately with inflation, money itself (currency) becomes the supply and its demands are artificially created. There is no limit to creative ways to spend currency that's losing value anyway. Seasonal Fashion, Fast Food, Tech Gadgets, Junk Entertainment, Vacations, Consumer  Goods, Drugs, Alcohol, Costume Jewellery, Processed Foods, Sports Cars, Yachts, Designer Dogs, $7 Lattes, Brunch, and a million other examples of excessive luxuries that simply do not create or retain any value.
Not suggesting that humanity should be purely utilitarian in their purchase choices, there is of course a place for luxury and enjoyment, but what I am arguing is that inflation creates an imbalance towards a tenancy for excessive luxury and simply using currency before its rendered useless over time.
What it discourages on the other hand (by virtue of making it that much more difficult) is saving, value investing or creation, and the pursuits of sustainable wealth and/or financial freedom.
A deflationary store of value flips the equation.
And I for one would love to see what happens if/when humanity refocuses all that ingenuity currently zoomed in on baseless consumerism onto actual needs.
Real supply for real demands worth the spending of real money.
