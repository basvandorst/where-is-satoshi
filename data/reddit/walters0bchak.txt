I just created an account there and posted to the 'Newbie' forum (unfortunately, that's the only one you can post to with a new account).

This is awesome -- good job everyone!
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:16:08
Sometimes I get a little concerned that the price is being pushed by someone who is looking to later sell...
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:41:54
Any idea when their daily clock resets (and obviously in what time zone)?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:10:39
I just logged in to look -- looks back to normal (mass clicking, waiting to lock a price)

Bitcoin is a currency, and should be used as such. What I'm saying (above) is some people with a lot of money could be manipulating BTC value simply to profit. This is a bad thing for Bitcoin and for people who want Bitcoin to grow as a currency. Not sure why I'm getting downvoted for stating this.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:48:28
OK, gotcha. Learning as I go.
In the past 10 minutes, it went from "Unconfirmed" to "4 confirmations", so maybe it is finally moving along.
Thank you for taking the time to explain some of this to me.

I haven't - with the price lag at the moment I don't want to touch it. I interpreted the wording from Coinbase to basically say it's a good thing if the price drops after you hit "buy" because you get the exchange rate whenever they receive the money. Therefore, it would only be bad if the price started to skyrocket when your order processed.
Edit: I misread/misinterpreted it. You pay the same amount of money no matter what, but the amount of Bitcoins you get will vary depending on the going rate at that time.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:24:48
Then it seems as though you could *avoid* paying taxes as long as you continue to use the BTC currency at its going-rate-value instead of converting it to your country's domestic currency. If you convert it, then you should pay.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:54:39
And as is always stated, that also means don't trust predictions that say the price of Bitcoin is going to skyrocket. Everyone is guessing - don't invest what you can't lose. That can't be said enough.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:08:06
Mind if we ask how many coins at $1? :)
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:49:26
Exactly. Also, since Bitcoin isn't a stock, it won't necessarily behave like one. We have experienced a hell of a jump in the last 3 months, which is great, but it's also a sign of great volatility.
@_date: 2013-03-19 12:41:15
What a guy! Or girl!
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:06:25
I told my girlfriend I was investing when the mini-bubble burst from 50 to 34 and she was a little skeptical. Not so much anymore!
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:59:02
How is it an evasion of taxes if you took money that you earned (say, USD), and have already paid taxes on, converted said money into another currency, and then converted it back at a later date?
This isn't a stock that rises in value when a company profits. It's a currency.
I'm not a whiz at economics and am likely completely off base, so anyone feel free to enlighten me.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:50:28
"with new coins “mined” by programmers who solve mathematical riddles."
That... is misleading.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:50:18
^^ Exactly. If you're "in it for the long run", then only risk what you're capable of losing and sit back. That's the only thing to do. If you're not comfortable with that, then sell off and don't look back.
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:16:09
Wished I had hopped aboard the Bitcoin train much earlier! Congrats - that's awesome.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:17:28
I'm so down on the whole thing at the moment that I'm not sure I'll get back into it if I can't recover this damn file. I work in IT, so I should know better than to not back up a file, but if I'm having this sort of issue and can lose ALL of my Bitcoins, what is a regular end user going to deal with? I'm sick to my stomach thinking of having lost ~ $1,000 because a program crashed.
@_date: 2013-03-06 16:00:53
Gotcha. How would you go about checking the balance of your offline wallet? I've downloaded the Bitcoin client to my computer, but it seems you can only generate new addresses, not add an existing one.
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:36:01
Must breed sports superstars to get a return! Damn them.

The name is perfect to allow newcomers/newbies ask the questions that they may otherwise refrain from asking because they deem the question "stupid". It may not really be a dumb question, but it gives us a repository for intro-level questions instead of a new post being dropped here or there. After a few weeks, we can refer new people to search the subreddit for the Moronic Monday threads for some answers.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:26:52
If you don't plan on using it to buy anything anytime soon, then yes you should transfer it to an offline wallet. It's up to you if that is on your computer or a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:20:40
actually pre-fork
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:21:31
Not to sound too ignorant, but how does that bitcointip end up in the other person's wallet?
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:08:19
You could be like Michael Scott(Michael Scott Paper Company episodes) and have an endless number of Bitcoin-Craigslist company names that you can use.
@_date: 2013-02-17 14:51:32
Hardware, I believe.

I think their new policy is you place a purchase order, they say "you will receive your order on XX/XX/XX day at the price on that date" and you have the option to cancel your order at any point up until the date/time of delivery.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:58:05
You're right - not surprising at all. Butterflylabs' miners are reaching their customers.

Hey, you can always make the right call in hindsight. Simply put, at that time, there was nothing to lead you to believe that those BTC would be worth anything down the road. Can't change it now -- who's to say you would have held on to all the necessary info to access it even if you didn't wipe it with the drive? Don't beat yourself up!
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:00:19
I had about 12 BTC in there (bought during the 50 -&gt; 34 mini-bubble), and the file seems to be completely gone. I'm running a "deleted file recovery" application, but my hopes are not high. I'm pretty bummed - I guess I should have made a backup of the file, but I've only been using the application for a few days. I've sent an email to the developer, too. Any other ideas?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:10:43
From the Buy/Sell transaction part of their site when you're logged in:
"Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Tuesday Apr 16, 2013 at 02:09PM EDT after your funds have arrived." (Note from me, not Coinbase: date and time are dependent on your current local date and time).
Also under "read more":
"How much bitcoin will I receive?
Due to higher than normal buy volumes, we are unable to provide exact price quotes right now.
Instead of pausing buys entirely, we decided to give people the option to purchase bitcoin at the market price in a few days. Once your USD funds arrive, we will exchange them to bitcoin at the market price at approximately Tuesday Apr 16, 2013 at 02:09PM EDT.
Note that you can cancel your order at any time up until your bitcoin arrive from the transfer history page.
The market price of bitcoin changes frequently. Below are some recent prices to give you an idea. These do not guarantee what the price will be in a few days."

My Multibit client destroyed my wallet yesterday (which I had not backed up.. ugh). I used a file recovery program to locate any/all wallet files available on my computer. I located the files that I believe I need and used Multibit's "Open Wallet" feature. Then, I created a new wallet, new address, and sent a test 1BTC transaction to the address last night, but seems to be in limbo.
I'm wondering if I somehow opened a wallet without technically have full access/not having the rights to send the funds (maybe I'm viewing the wallet without the private key somehow?) I've only been using Multibit for the past week.
Any-who, I will have to play with it some more tonight in hopes of recovering the funds, but though it interesting that a transaction hit the blockchain and just stuck there.

Hindsight is 20/20 my friend - I'm sure you still turned a nice profit on that investment.
