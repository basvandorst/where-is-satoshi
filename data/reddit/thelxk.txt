As a licensed bubble specialist I urge not to trust this person. 
Every craftsman with experience knows that bubbles cannot happen until 4.9 times the dot com bubble peak, not 5 times. Such coarse rounding is just unprofessional and not endorsed by the guild.

If you split the Bitcoin chart by year you will clearly see that it goes up when the year number increases.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:21:06
There is no such thing as intrinsic value of anything really. 
The author of the whole value investing idea gave up in the 80s or so and conceeded to the idea that the markets are a voting machine, in both the short and the long run.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:31:07
Is it not? Why should random lines and calculations on a chart be better?
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:12:22
Yeah, never saw something go into the negatives! Unless you hodl with a margin. 
Also worst case i'll just use the stuff for some smart contract home automation with my neighbors. We can't share parking slots properly without it.

Are you implying they manage their backbone via the UI? That would explain things lol

How else would they know how to calculate their fair share of your money?

Not crazy, just too much guessing and extrapolation.
Consider your economic wellbeeing, the country you're living in and ask yourself whether it is the same for other people around the world - because you take yourself as a baseline for average ppl.
Some of my relatives don't even have a debit card, even though I use Android pay in their village just fine.

OFC the most probable way to control it is via energy usage restrictions, hence the "energy waste" narrative circling the internets. 
For BTC to be the shift we all hope it will, we need decentralized energy grids, affordable mining hardware as well as over-the-air mesh networks. At that point small local economies could do price discovery entirely in BTC, without needing the whole mess/overhead which is current financial institutions and related regulators - a huge energy waste in itself.

@_date: 2018-01-24 07:23:51
True, and bitcoin allows you to take your feet onto other ground without having to ask those ppl for permission - forcing them to start thinking about accountability, in the mean time, nonetheless.
It is the only solution for people who were born on the wrong ground and the reason to commit to projects in crypto when one has free time.

It's not self-determination if everything is determined by today's mood of it's dictator. 
Similar to Russia's "silicon valley" nothing is free and taxes get collected by having gov. officials relatives' company services as a necessary requirement for businesses to start operating there. 
It's not that you have to pay official taxes or anything, just brace for unscheduled visits and fines of regulatory departments, especially around holidays etc. Whoever sees this as something other than a ponzi scheme (in this case ran by ppl in the gov.) would ignore post-soviet history and mentality in those regions.

You lost me by bringing anti-semitism into an otherwise interesting comment, well done.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:47:33
In theory at least. 
Until I see their code I am going to assume regular code quality, meaning monolith of doom and proportional tech debt. I doubt they can update a single dependency without impacting users at this point.
Engineering, esp. software, does not scale linearily with size, it decays exponentially with added variables.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:35:00
Actually less mining centralization in China is a good thing for bitcoin, but I doubt all mining ops will just "orderly exit".
 
Though they may need their Fiat to re-structure atm.

You mean useful things like the gaussian copula? Apart from that it seems to be just riding the wave of AI/Big Data innovation.

No worries m8. On a long enough timescale the the chance of everybody going bankrupt is 100%.

Correlation something something causation?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:55:36
From a technical nor even a risk management point no. No alt can jump in. 
We would need something that is well written, decentralized and secure at scale - there are lots of projects out there that sell scalability (DAG, proof of stake) but trade the whole premise of trustless consensus for it - what point is trying to build a means to freely transfer value if it is neither free nor reliable?

Just hodl, it's common worryedge.

Electrum doesn't support the legacy segwit addresses and the new ones are not supported on most pools, exchanges, vendors so meh.

I guess because of two things:
1. Proof of concept that private money can exist without them (a philosophical shock, no doubt). I dunno why you say it doesn't proof anything. It already proofs a lot of things, and ID(passports), property rights are next.
2. Simple loss of market share (esp. potential market share, considering ~half of humanity is not using banks)

I am not sure that word means what you think it means
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:17:10
Which version? Well support may not be the correct word. You cannot create them via UI anymore, and there are enough issues about that on the Git.

So you have a method of finding rational investors, but how does that reflect on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:27:30
Yeah, every true data miner knows computers work on smoke, not coins. If you let the smoke out, they stop working.

Well the guys at cardano promised to make themselves quantum resistant in 2018, so someone can take their few lines of, peer reviewed and verified, Haskell and port them to some hundred lines of C++ if push comes to shove.
The good thing about open cryptos is that the technology is not a zero sum game.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:35:19
Market share needs to increase a lot, users need to become more diverse, but in the end it always will be volatile, because it is an open currency. 
Consider two things:
1. There are more volatile Fiat currencies around (Venezuela, Zimbabwe) etc. Most ppl compare to the USD or Euro which are exceptionally stable.
2. Fiat cannot be withdrawn all at once, because technically, you don't own your money. The BTC on your wallet can. Nobody is stopping huge money movements with AML, ATF, business days or bank holidays.

Yeah but I'm reading the original doc from the first Google link on "NIST Bitcoin" and it still points to the old version.
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:23:58
If you see the Enterprise word, you know it will be more of the same old stuff. 
I bet all that traditional banks will gain from it is a fork of ethereum without all the interesting stuff, because it doesn't fit into their gatekeeper business model. Banking usually buys out their competition - they will have a hard time buying out crypto.
