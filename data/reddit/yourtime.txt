I don’t see it as currency listed, they would have written BITCOIN/USD or something else. Sadly they seem to see it just as asset :/

In austria we also have to track everything, they say „cryptocurrency is not seen as currency. So everytime you are trading from one asset to another, they expect x -&gt; eur / eur —&gt; y instead of x -&gt; y
I will write down my transactions, but not how much money that was, how should I know that?  Most crypto don’t have a fiat exchange, so their value is based on another anyway.

Is graphene something that bch consider to implement?

Why does that make the bitcoin better? Its just a different value :/

I agree, but I also think... we could do way better. If you want replace a system, being a small upgrade is often easily discarded

This sounds bullshitty, I mean you should yourself be able to decide. They decide the rate and also when. 
Basically they make money and give you as excuse an amount back. Maybe I am just to paranoid, but is this transparent enough?

Sorry, I guess my fault. I thought bitcoin as payment alternative not as gold alternative.

its just big talking. He wont do anything most stuff they said they want do, they aren’t able to do, specially, when I watch most of our technology standard in most of our official buildings.
One would say germany is around 5 years behind america in terms of technology in goverment... austria is again 5 years behind of germany. 
I am working with customers of officials and I really would like to see how they want observe most of the crypto market like that.

Well i have no idea, about this bill or something, but from the title I would say: you could argument they want https make a crime, because it also conceals ‚data‘ many things are data.
