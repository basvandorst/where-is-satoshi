Hmmmm .... is this what all the "q" inputs are for?
"In mathematics, orthogonal coordinates are defined as a set of d coordinates q = (q1, q2, ..., qd) in which the coordinate surfaces all meet at right angles (note: superscripts are indices, not exponents). A coordinate surface for a particular coordinate qk is the curve, surface, or hypersurface on which qk is a constant. For example, the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) is an orthogonal coordinate system, since its coordinate surfaces x = constant, y = constant, and z = constant are planes that meet at right angles to one another, i.e., are perpendicular. Orthogonal coordinates are a special but extremely common case of curvilinear coordinates."
The wiki sub-section on, "Integration"?

Could it be an, "Asymptotic cone" using the "x" box missing glyph as the point it approaches, of which lays between "almost" and "open"?
Is that the only valid two sections of this puzzle to grab words from then?
(source:  )
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:15:22
Yeah that line through the "x" does sure look like a "7" (257), I think you're onto it ... I had no idea 77 is a prime (I am so math illiterate lol).
If 77 is an important prime then could 77 be where a chain of blocks stops at when running the C++ sequencing or where it starts; or is 77 the number we need to put into the SHA256 algorithm or look for in a header as a pointer, hmmmm?
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:51:51
When I get time, early this week I'll make a long post about it more in depth (I need to figure out what free service I want to use to upload all the images I have). For now I think it may point to the final output of headers -- I don't think it will be the answer but a pointer to where to find the answers as the other clue is "code easily". Anyway, I saw a programing video last week and there is a shortcut to coding the z q sequence math stuff so the computer doesn't have to go slow with the pattern but skips it to go fast with running the z q to infinity which is how I think the z's and q's should be run but there are clues to where to start and stop otherwise it would keep running on forever.
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:27:45
... or maybe like you said it is two 7's thus one 7 shows up on the puzzle by itself beside the words, "go" and "else". So maybe the input int is 7? Be it the missing int, be it the stop point of the chain (7 blocks or 7 branches in, be it a chain or a Merkel Tree depending), or maybe it is 7 headers of the chain output, or a the Hex of 7, or the 7th ASCII thingy, or something to do with SHA256 using 7?
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:48:45
Maybe it is symbolic, as in not a graph that overlays this image but the idea behind the graph whereby Buzz Lightyear crosses the Y axis from the X axis. Thus, all three "y" shapes have a cross "x" thereby connecting them when lines are drawn as seen here by Tumbaba: 
Furthermore, I think more than one of the Greek orgs from that movie, Revenge of the Nerds, is utilized here as that "M" is not a Sigma nor a capitalized "M" but a "mu" math symbol. Not to mention, erm3s suggestions about a snake eating its own tail like a looped infinity the circle line could be a stand-in for conceptualizing, Alpha and Omega ... which was another Greek org in that movie, Revenge of the Nerds.

I didn't know there was stuff on the "Right Side" of this sub, I'm on the app I wonder how I may get to that. Again, I have never actually used Reddit until now, just always read the threads on here over the years without logging in lol. My apologies, I just saw so many saying one clue and then providing their crypto addresses -- figured to do that and explain as to why I'm attempting this puzzle. Plus, I'm asking to make a deal forming a team first and foremost btw of which I said my terms $4K in USD for my surgery. I wasn't asking to be given for $4K USD, I was laying out my terms and conditions for solving the puzzle with other people. Aside from that I showed my YouCaring more as proof that this is not a scam, more so than expecting a donation (I never said, "please donate to me"), but such was merely implied -- my YouCaring has the proof of the oral surgeon's estimate I got as well as my full name and I signed up here with my full name as again this was to negotiation solving the puzzle with people and I figured they might want to know why I was requesting half of the winnings thus I provided that by proof of my YouCaring link. I understand that this was seen as begging though it was more like this is what I want from whoever I team up with, but I'm trying to point out that I wasn't literally asking for $4K USD I was asking and showing why I wanted half of the pot if my clues lead to the 1 BTC treasure. Thanks for explaining the down vote thing, I heard about that from a friend yesterday too so now so know. Thank you! &lt;3

So are we finding the block headers in the Merkle Tree then, or are we looking for two chains of which one is an attacker that gets orphaned -- or are we performing both of these to find solutions to the solution? Does the March 2013 to July 2013 fiasco of chains have anything to do with the past we should be focusing upon?

@_date: 2018-05-28 18:05:00
During March of 2013:
BTC had competing Berkley Database (BerkleyDB) vs. Google's Level Database (LevelDB) run time consensus algorithms. Of which the BerkleyDB version had a bug limiting the file descriptors.
Also during that same time frame, "Bitcoin’s computing power distribution between 2 April 2013 and 1 July 2013. BTC Guild and 50BTC controlled more than 55 percent of network computing power, until ASICMiner achieved more than 20 percent of the hashing power" (source:
 ).
Thus, with the data presented within this puzzle I think the process we may have to take is this, (maybe that's the "001" in the puzzle is for and/or what the "00212121" clue is for in first running the SHA256 to get the finger print and/or a valid Block header of which may start and stop at specific places based upon the data presented in the puzzle so to validate the blocks between those two points and/or possibly just replicating or studying the Blockchain history of when the miners lost their Block Rewards for being on the wrong chain) as explained here in this video lecture:
 ("Consensus Algorithms, Blockchain Technology and Bitcoin UCL - by Andreas M. Antonopoulos" posted on aantonop's YouTube channel).
Also, if the missing input of an "int" number starts with two zeros then the, "number has to be less than 'two' to the 254" and maybe since the first zero used -1 this part of -1 for the math still applies for doubling to the next zero is my illiterate-to-math guess as in starting at, "00" (this is quoted from and explained around the 7 minutes and 45 seconds mark of Mr. Antonopoulos' video linked above).
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:46:00
Yesssss! This this this!
!Lambda, Lambda, Lambda!
But it is just a wee bit difficult because you need some math to make the rectangle (I think so, but most will see this as simple math -- I am no good at any level of math lol).
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:29:58
? ... and maybe that's why we have to also "try 201" or "try +1"? To produce the value for the target in SHA256, and maybe the "target" is the "x marking home" on the missing glyph box within the puzzle font image unless it is suppose to be a Sigma and not the missing value? Maybe it is Sigma (the math symbol that looks like a funny looking "E"), and we need the ACSII Hex for the letter/glyph that represents Sigma as the input "int" number for +1 and/or -1 depending on where and how such data is used; be it used for finding the starting 0's which is using -1 or be it using +1 for getting a target -- all this to maybe obtain a finger print verification which may use a string of words run through the SUM function of SHA256 rather than numbers as an input ... ?
These are just some ideas to try, but this process maybe the process used (from the video), but from what data inputs I'm still unsure about.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:05:56
Oh snap, good eye -- I missed this little "y" could be implying the math symbol for Lambda like the actual bigger Lambda symbol used within. So the orange "y" is beyond infinity, while the white Lambda "y" is within infinity. Hmmmmmmm ...
Oh and that word, "modify" is by "hashing" and "transactions" so I'm still pretty convinced until proven otherwise that we need to be using either the mining algorithm z's and q's or the hashing SHA256 function by modifying it with certain inputs from pointers found from this puzzle. What the pointers could be, I have yet to begin to guess ::: sigh :::

Trust me when I say I know absolutely no math stuff. Just concepts, only concepts lol ...
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:08:38
Yes :-) about the missing char symbol within the font (source:  ). Yet, in the 766 glyph package of this type font there is a pig glyph. I wonder what it's ASCII &amp; Hex is, as symbolically it could be a piggy bank (lol)?
BTW, "Work Sans is a free, open-source typeface designed by Australian type designer Wei Huang" (source:  ). The name, Wei, is also a name of one of the authors cited in the sources used within the White Paper.
Also, thanks for the name I forgot the name of the symbol as I'm generally bad with names. My roomate didn't explain it that way they said it was an unknown like how "x" is used in algebra which seemed a bit confusing but all math to me is confusing so meh. Thanks for clarifying that Lambda is dependant upon the context of the math formula where it is expressed.

Revenge of the Nerds, this is brilliant!
OMG that "M" on the circle line isn't a capitalized "m", it is the "mu" math symbol!!!
(I think OP used the Greek orgs in that movie as landmarks within this image)
Do you think this is why, "John" the word is within this image under the word, "returned"? Hence, John Stephen Goodman in, "[H]is role as the football head coach for Adams College in the movie Revenge of the Nerds" (source Wikipedia)?
Thank you for the clarification by use of the image upload with your connecting lines btw.
=D Extremely helpful! &lt;3
Looking at those lines I wonder, does Lambda equal zero *or* does Lambda equal z and we have to then discern what z is from other data? The lines also cross the number, 6, as well.
// Could be "&lt;=" not just equal to but also "more than and/or equal to".

Anyway, I have received a gift to save my life. So I removed my unruley comment(s) as I have no need to negotiate terms of splitting the reward.

A taste of some clues I will be bringing to the table soon:
In other comments, as well as in private, I have stated that I think the pairing of the z's and q's are either pertaining to the mining of blocks on a valid chain vs an attack chain but one would have to know how to run this algorithm or do the math to get this part of the answer. The other thing this maybe is the pairing of the z's and q's may have to do with the pairing of doubling the HashCash SHA function, as BitCoin hashes it twice over to make up for the future of the encryption weakening. To find this one would have to know how to run the HashCash function that BitCoin uses or know the encryption math behind it to obtain this. These are the two ideas of the z's and q's pairing which correspond to the formula missing in the graphic as a glyph where a Sigma would be at (the funny looking "E" found in the White Paper math formula). The upside down "y" is a math symbol too and it too is a clue as it is the unknown that lays after the infinity symbol, "to infinity and beyond" -- Buzz Lightyear in Pixar's Toy Story. Plus, I think there is a total of 3 steps to solving the original puzzle prior to OP removing the last step for us all. I think that only based upon the pairing clue in the image itself of, "3" and "way". Also, I think the circle is what is standing in as infinity and the answer from the z's and q's, or some other form of a pointer, will possibly give reference points upon the infinite spots plotted within the raster pixels of the circle; hence the Pixar reference quote as a clue (Pixar aka Pixels).
I could totally be looking way too much into this and be completely wrong, as I have no ability to check my hunches as I lack Blockchain programing skills and math skills.

A 5th of the 1 BTC prize, I'll keep that in mind if by some miracle I ever solve this puzzle (I'm certain someone else will beat me to it though). I'm staying out of learning, curiosity, and fun. As I've stated before I have the minimum funds to not die now so winning is no longer a priority of mine here -- I just want to know the solution eventually in order to learn how these puzzles can be made. After all, I'm also an artist so it would be cool to one day make my own.

::: shrugs :::
I don't blame em3s. That was my plan at first haha unless I teamed up, but now I'm posting anything and everything (eventually, I haven't sat down and uploaded all the pics I want to post here as reference), and so I have exited the two team up reply offers as of Saturday since I have my surgery funds to not die regardless of solving this puzzle or not (besides I doubt I would solve it by myself, I didn't even know 77 was a prime for example which proves I'm at a steep disadvantage here only knowing artistic design and BitCoin theoretical concepts, no grammar nor math to back-up either pursuit niche lol fml lol). Oh and I know too little of C++ to feel confident enough that I would be coding anything properly lol there's that too, as years ago when I did learn C++ even though I think I got a B grade in that course in college and a C or D grade back when I had it in high school, honestly I have always been but a mere incompetent script kiddie never an actual programmer (unless I can copy n paste chunks of code to mash up together in one big sloppy thing which works great in CSS haha, I'm not going to be building any solution using C++ anytime soon though lol).
With that said, when I get my oral surgery and on the road to recovery, I might try out of pure boredom at my hand in running some C++ for this puzzle -- assuming I'll be in less pain so to focus and think clearly and assuming this puzzle won't be solved by then still.

Someone this past Saturday already sent me the minimum funds I need to save my life, thus I have no reason to be cryptic nor hodl since I don't need the 1 BTC let alone half of it as desperately as I once did to prevent an otherwise treatable premature death scenario (granted if BTC really does go really Bearish I may have screwed myself as I haven't cashed out that gift/donation yet, since I'm just a wee bit paronoid and want to have it post to my checking the same day I swipe to pay for my surgery -- I haven't signed up for a BTC/crypto-debit-card yet -- and I have legit reasons to be slightly paronoid about keeping fiat USD in my checking hence I moved into crypto). Though tbh, 1 BTC or any Satoshis would be nice as I have been living off of $400/m since 2009 (that's $4,800/yr which I found out today is less than the average wage of the 1930s in the USA, fml lol). Yet, since learning Day Trading and Scalp Trading I'm optimistic that cryptocurrencies may be the sling shot I need to swing me out of poverty -- of which I have yet to incur any actual loss of my initial investment back when I started with a $50 USD investment at the end of December 2016. Thus, with every gain I build off of my small initial investment trading portfolio is a gain in savings I may one day soon liquidate to fund a business launch and thereby obtain secure housing with such an income finally after becoming homeless back in August of 2014 (though by 2015 I was offered free room and board, yet the State still categorizes me as homeless since I'm living with friends where I'm not exactly a leasing occupant). Regardless, I'm pretty confident in my plan to exicute this upward mobility quest of mine, as I have yet to take any trading losses; *and* I already once had a business in the 2000s so I've already been around that block albeit it was humble compared to what my newly found ambitions are today.
Anyway, I been posting what I have when I have the time to, granted I have yet to upload all the pics I took of searching this image lol but that's on my to-do list this week. I just been busy now that the work week in the USA started again. I was prepping most of this day for my surgery by getting all my "adulting"-life ducks in a row (like scheduling appointments, and realizing I had lapsed in my payments for renewing what pathetic little dental coverage I had under an individual private HMO -- the annoyance of an expired card failing to auto-draft the payment that my ADD mind long ago forgot about which was why I signed up to auto-draft in the first place). This was a chain reaction of revelations, after the oral surgeon office, upon trying to schedual me in, asked for my insurence patient Identification Number of which I didn't know and had no idea where I placed my membership card info at lol (someone should hurry up with that Blockchain ID stuff so to make this adulting easier in life lol all these dang IDs and passwords ugh when we could all be using a crypto-signature and a public key to store and varify everything like a better version of LastPass).

Regarding someone finding a pentagram (I tried to find their subReddit post here in the thread to know their handle but either they deleted it or I'm missing it lacking an eye for scrolling detail) aka star within the circle, I been too busy to check as I was thinking this may exist anyway but been out this holiday and my phone screen does this puzzle no justice, but it was on my to-do list given this info I came across upon this past week researching every clue down any rabbit hole I could find:
There may indeed be a star in the circle, and it may or may not be towards the 1 BTC treasure. OP said there were consolation prizes. Thus, in a way, there maybe Easter Eggs hidden within this puzzle too I presume from such clues OP submitted.
One of the clues quoted Pixar's Toy Story Buzz Lightyear, Buzz Lightyear used an Easter Egg to propel him to fly. That Easter Egg in Toy Story and in other Pixar films was a ball with a big red star and the ball also had a ring and I think it was a yellow ring band over a predominantly blue ball if I remember correctly -- thus in 2D this would render as a circle with a star in the middle. I have a hunch this is one of the smaller consolation prizes of which have been hidden within this puzzle. Though, again, I have not sat down and searched for this star so I cannot confirm that a star can be found but someone on this Reddit thread beat me to posting this "star" idea and so are claiming there is indeed a star within the puzzle's circle. I am however providing the reasoning as to why that matches up to the clues given, if such a star does exist there in this puzzle.
Good luck hunting ;-) those Easter Eggs too!

I have always heard rumors about how brutal Reddit Admins and down votes are for making stuff disappear (which Roger Ver rants about upon shilling his BCH), but I'm brand freaking new to Reddit and my first post ever has disappeared and yet someone shilling XVG with just the word Verge posted as their subReddit comment gets to keep their comment on this thread that has nothing to do with XVG and yet my comment gets disappeared without even the notation of, "removed" as a placeholder? I'm new to Reddit, so please explain this logic. While my 1st ever posted comment was long winded it did say some ideas for solving the puzzle, but on that same post I also requested anyone to team up with me as I'm willing to split the winnings so long as I get my oral surgery funding so I don't die from a rather preventable death from lacking such funds -- which is why I became interested in this puzzle. In addition I had provided a link to my YouCaring fundraiser as well as my BTC wallet address if anyone had the urge for charity and thereby I could then instead try to solve the puzzle just for fun or at least help more publicly towards everyone if I didn't actually need a minimum of $4K USD to not die. Was my comment disappeared due to the YouCaring link? I saw people were not removed or disappeared for providing their wallet addresses, frankly I did the same and technically YouCaring is just another form of payment just as a wallet is thank y'all very much. I'll make some clue posts separately I guess, aside from this question post in the form of a rant. Seeing that this too may disappear or become removed. A guy who dropped the clue about vector math being involved had their comment "removed", granted they in the same comment dropped their email and phone number (but I assume it was probably a burner number lol or a honeypot trap to call). Either way, could someone introduce me to the absurd rules being enforced here on Reddit so I know?

@_date: 2018-05-25 23:02:32
Yes, I think this too. There are also 3 colors visible to the naked eye used within this design, as well as the "B" BitCoin symbol containing the pairing of "3" and "way" next to the "x" glyph-box that marks home between the words, "almost" and "open". Yet, despite this I'm still certain I have to utilize math and I have no math skills whatsoever nor am I educated in programing for any type of Blockchain programs so this path keeps bringing me to the fact that I need some math or programing skills to solve this puzzle (this is my assumption thus far; especially give the clue of, "code easily"). There maybe 3 layers of a cypher within this vector turned raster graphic, or there maybe three steps to the ordering of unlocking the phrase needed to obtain the BTC reward since, "order" appears right by "almost" after all.

There are two corresponding orange "y" chars that touch the white circle line in exactly the same way with, "modify" and "every" and this "y" may or may not be a stand-in for the Lambda math symbol which is placed next to the infinity symbol within the white part of the puzzle graphic. Thus, these two "y" chars could be start and stop points along the curve of the circle for finding something such as the Lambda for the BitCoin math formula put into the White Paper, or the Target for a Merkel Tree, or the Lambda could even be a Base upon using Recursion which it is then finding the "n" within that mathy formula stuff of performing Recursion.
Check this out!

"must [wi]thou[t] trust on[e] blockchain ..."
Also there's that random, "k" sitting all by its lonesome, and I think I remember "k" being in one of those math formulas somewhere for something so it maybe useful too btw. Next maybe, "now problem proof order" which ends by "k&gt;=z" and "z=0". Besides, what's up with that "c" within "CPU" as that too looks out of place just as "help" looks odd within the "C" of "transaction" and I found out there's a C language command: "help" if programing like just type help when wanting to know more about C/C+/C++ hence maybe it's a cute reminder saying, "see help" by "C" &amp; "help" lol?

[this comment is irrelevant to the puzzle]
This is just an "out there" random thought but ...
Isn't it odd that the Coin_Artist puzzle revealed some weird BTC siphon, and now *this* puzzle happens just as smaller minning network/hashed cryptocurrencies are getting hit with 51% attacks and the like (XVG wasn't exactly a classic 51% attack per se, as it merely manipulated the coding within the deployed mining algorithm) -- all while this puzzle's creator/host has dropped the clues that implies an attacker's chain? Are these two events related y'all think, or just mere coincidence?
This idea of some Conspiracy Theory hit me when I was watching Ivan on Tech's, "Did Roger Convince Ivan!? 51% Attack Cost - Programmer explains" YouTube video (source:  ).
Just a random thought as I was sipping my coffee waking up this morning.

Anyway, I'm explaining what I been up to in case my donor is lurking reading my update -- besides IDGAF what y'all think.
@_date: 2018-05-26 13:49:31
I think the pairing is either the mining algorithm or the double hashing function used by BitCoin from HashCash to solve the weaker SHA. As the z's and q's are pairs for either scenario. But hey, maybe you're right and I'm wrong lol!
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:25:48
Can you drop a URL to a source that I may read about the specific scam you're referencing? I'm not well versed in that history, but my layer security protects me enough from scams anyway so I am not at all worried about such -- plus being "homeless" also has the perk of not being found ;) where I sleep at night via a public search of physical address records (the public data is all wrong or old/outdated). Thus, I fear no evil!
Besides, wirering $10 Euros worth of fiat money is stupid. It requires giving your banking account number and routing number out and a malicious business entity can then charge that account now knowing the numbers to charge. Only rich people get special bank accounts to protect against this (I wanted to figure out how to ripp off scammers and found this loop hole, but the banks that offered that protection requires big bank balances and high account opening fees to be eligible for that specialized protection) the rest of us banked non-rich people have to fill out paper work after theft has occurred making us wait for our property to be returned and cleared of any wrongful overdrafts and legal liability.
This is also why BitCoin and other cryptocurrencies are so awesome, no one can charge your account when you send them initial funds -- it's a one way non-reversable transaction using a public address that cannot be charged. Why ever send a wire, in a world of PayPal and BitCoin lol? Only luddite dinos do that.

@_date: 2018-05-27 13:41:07
I'm not sure where the points within the circle are but I'm convinced there are corresponding points within the line of that circle and it could be as simple as looking at the design to match them up, use the numbers like you did, or something more difficult like using pointers returned from the mining algorithm or HashCash function from the pairing of z's and q's.
Anyway, both the infinity symbol and the unknown symbol (upside down "y") are not only within but are beside the line that curves to form the circle and a circle has infinite points on it so I think this has to do with infinity but within infinity there will be these specific points and those points are info/data to get through the steps for unlocking the wallet's private key.
If OP were inspired by Coin_Artist in also how they executed their design of this puzzle, then I would run the RBG color values, and/or look for simple outliner clues along any edge (mainly the circle as I really think that's the infinity OP implies in their Reddit clues) -- as that was how the 3 year long puzzle was solved (the flames using RBG values and the ribbon lengths). If so it is technically in plain sight but not really imho as one would have to interpret what is in plain sight in front of us all as it isn't actually straightforward -- but maybe it is ::: shrugs :::

If we are using half the words, I wonder if these eyes allow us to see which half of the words we are suppose to be using and which ones we may discard.
@_date: 2018-05-26 13:33:57
YES!!!! THIS. The z's and q's and some P's along with the Sigma part of the equation is all for dealing out the mining algorithm, and to run it in code it is coded "easily" (aka "code easily" was a clue) instead of the long way there is a code technique short cut used to find this sequence. Then from this answer I believe there are pointers to the next answer. I think there are 3 steps to unlocking the code by the hint within the puzzle where it says "way" and "3" so I assume maybe there are three layers to unlock and doing the mining attack chain block sequence is one of the steps to getting possibly the ordering of the phrase needed for the wallet key.
This is just a hunch of mine

It depends upon your needs and abilities.
If needing mobile access to trading platforms, Coinbase and Binance are good (get their app). If you want an option as a low level investor/trader to keep what little anonymity you can get through a KYC compliant on-ramp, Coinbase is your enemy while Binance has that feature but only under a certain price-point of transfers.
If mobile platforms aren't a restriction, the world has endless possibilities for you -- choose Exchanges with decent volumes and those who have somewhat of a reputation for being compitant at guarding your on-ramp fiat funds from thieves.
If you hate fees, you might want to look at the fees associated with each Exchange prior to signing up and using it, be it trading fees, or transfer fees, or wire/card fees -- take note of the price you'll pay for the service the Exchange is providing to you and compare it to the level of service they actually provide their customers (for instance, some say Binance has high fees but Binance uses their profits to reinvest in their business to keep quality high for their customers).
Never leave your cryptos sitting on an Exchange, so don't use Coinbase as your HODL "wallet" as it isn't your wallet lol it is Coinbase's wallet, until they release the coins to your off-Exchange wallet which you will make and backup yourself.

I can guess what erm3s was referencing when they spoke cryptically about (I could be wrong though): Milky Way, running away towards the infinite, spirals, and diamonds. Such are literary references that may influenced this design and/or at the least the design of the logo. I suspect with this kind of niche knowledge, or really useful coincidence, erm3s is someone we should lend our ear to when they comment as they may know somehow something we all have yet to find out.
I came across this after I decided to figure out if the "B" logo for BitCoin was tilted at a 10° angle or not, turns out it is by default either tilted to 12.5° or rounded off to 14° (as for this image I haven't checked, I will have to find an app that allows me to overlay those math tools to dicern the degree of angles), thus I was wrong about whatever "10" was suppose to be used for but in the meantime I found pretty cool historical art and literary stuff about it all.

Not really, I thought it was cute for the HODLers as a joke. Besides, the traders I learned from do in fact think shorting is a fool's game of gambling, and I prefer not to gamble even with what little I have to put in anyway. Not to mention most people who short actually have no clue what they're doing, so there's that too. This is not to claim all are fools; imho most are since few have such skills to avoid being fools in such trading options.

Look for the thread here:

Get one BitCoin (BTC), wait for the bulls. When the BTC bulls run, all the ALTs will drop, then buy some fav ALTs you think will run after BTC finishes its head start -- thereby diversifying your portfolio. With that said, long term wise aka HODL it is overall best to go with BTC as it is slow but steady in its overall rise in price. Plus, BTC is the only proven resilient cryptocurrency to date no other has yet to truly prove itself from all attacks; while Monero (XMR) is the only proven fungible cryptocurrency to date but is inflationary unlike the deflationary BTC.
HODL on!

I think we have enough hints and people are following different paths and reporting on their efforts. I for one have not had my interest wane let alone vanish. I think most of us, even I at one time, were missing it completely -- as stated prior this is a "treasure hunt" and it should be approached like a "marathon" not a sprint. Thus, maybe we should treat it as such and not be blinded by the tendency to run Blockchain operations. Due to the obvious theme I was insistent upon running Blockchain operations at first glance, but now I realize there could be something else to this puzzle.

Any peer to peer Exchange that utilizes TOR and encrypted chat features to set-up the IRL meet-up. There are some to choose from, see which have the most participants/volume within your area. Also, be sure that making an Exchange in this way doesn't break any local or national laws wherever you are. Some States within the USA, for example, have passed laws against IRL P2P crypto Exchnages as the persons are deemed to be illegally dealing due to not registering their business and not getting the proper licenses for the financial industry services.

I was 16 when I learned about the real current state of global economics: Mixed-Market-Finacialized-Capitalism. I also learned a handful of alternative economic systems during that same time; including Communism, Socialism, Mutualism, Resource-Based Economic Futurism, Solidarity Economy, Gift Economies, Shared Economies, Laissez-Faire Capitalism, Mixed-Market Capitalism, L.E.T.s, Parecon, and early failures of cryptocurrencies which included some ring signature token-ring-based coin prototypes and then there was the idea of B-Money too floating around the web during that same time when I had deep dived into all this economic stuff.
Thus, don't confuse intellect with education let alone ignorance by default among any given schooled population.
I think exposure to economic realities is wise to do as children develop their knowledge about the world they have came to inhabit. They would certainly be getting a further head start than I had as a teen back in the day lol!

That's true, but these guys I ended up being matched with don't even know how to operate a BitCoin wallet ... all they do is short and they do so with other people's money (now those are even bigger fools, letting someone else trade for you is such foolishness). It'll be funny AF when the bulls really come out to stampede, and then guys like these will have to explain themselves to their clients and/or bosses.
On the otherhand, to your point *logically* it makes 100% sense for miners to short BTC -- imho anyone else who shorts are gamblers. Miners already have a position by default and they are merely hedging to cover any potential loss within the volatile commodity market. Like a crop farmer hedging for drought, just in case.

Did y'all know there are a ton of similarities between maritime conceptually named ideas and BitCoin ideas? For example they both utilize mnemonic tools, there's even "nodes" too. Not to mention memorization sayings like voting:
(granted the other way of this phrase is rapey and misogynistic, so be forewarned to any triggers -- yikes)
Anyway, so what if there's a home, a destination marked as "x", as well as a place upon the image as a map where the hypothetical ship has been lost? Thus, maybe we need to employ the method of finding our "bearings" like this:
If I had a "compass rose" I might guess to place it upon the missing glyph box symbol -- or where this elusive "x" lays at on this image map. Granted this maybe done by merely a ruler, a protractor, and a math-compass (the two feet you'll need to walk the plank aka the "rhumb line(s)"). I think this math is based in trigonometry, of which I don't know either.
Enjoy the treasure hunt!

I'm now thinking the same, but it may still take some math like Trigonometry or Geomotry (depending how complicated finding the treasure is, like the lines drawn may have a numeretical distant to them or something). I'm working on finding a hidden "x" other than the obvious missing glyph "X" thing.

I think whoever posted the, "P=NP" was inferring that a code breaking algorithm isn't going to crack this puzzle since this math logic implies no one can currently break cryptography used in BTC let alone a "random walk" program going through this word map puzzle image.
I was just posting this for anyone who wondered like I did about that, "P=NP" post a while back. I was not implying in using it to solve this puzzle, I agree it has nothing to do with this puzzle other than proofing its difficulty. Though, I think the concept of utilizing a "checksum" *maybe* useful in narrowing down the combo of words chosen to try for the mnemonic phrase seed. The question is, does this image give us the number for the checksum?

I was returning from my surgery consolation prep, and my rideshare driver ended up being a FOREX trader. He said, "Twenty-thousand was the forever high" and "BitCoin will never recover." I replied, "BitCoin overall is still in an uptrend, it will get back to and rise above its last all time high as it has continued to do so in performance. Besides, it is still in the start!"

This makes no sense though, as it is pretty difficult to lose profits, let alone have actual loss to your initial investment, if you started prior to or during the start of the major bull run.

Was it due to TenX getting wrecked after the credit card companies cut their support line? I wonder when TenX will come back with their card independent of the major credit card companies (or has that already happened)? I never invested in TenX, as it seemed too risky (my goal is to grow what small trading portfolio I have, not risk it for greed of mooning high). I am however interested in their product at TenX, as I would like as many debit card options for crypto as possible so I may choose the one that suits my needs. It was horrible what the big bankster credit companies did to businesses like TenX, shame.

Anyway, I'm not going to die because by the time I cash out the donation for my life saving surgery it will be back at or above where it was when I was sent those donation funds. Even if I'm wrong, I can always suck it up and liquidate my trading portfolio to cover the difference of what the donation lost; assuming the difference is a mere $2K or less (though doing so will set me back in gaining housing accommodations of my own but meh I would be in the same strain and worse if I had never gotten into crypto with my small start of $50 USD initial first investment half in BTC and half in XMR back in Dec '16 to Feb '17.
I shall never bet against BitCoin.
BitCoin will win!
