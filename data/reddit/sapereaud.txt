Because Chinese miners don't like change, because hard forks are scary and because bitcoin is basically Nokia 6 years ago.

Dw it's normal that anything that is not "bitcoin is best/to the moon" gets down voted without any real discussion.

Cheer mate! I didn't even know about bitcointip, this thing will be awesome fun!

Its just a wallet for now, but they are looking into other options is all I know.

Well I regularly order there, so I just emailed them and asked if they were gonna implement it like puroexpress. 
Gotta keep up with the competition

Sure don't have an intelligent conversation, just moan and cry that the coins your investing in are not being featured. I weep for r/bitcion.
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:24:00
Amazing at how easy it seems.

It's one of those things that's still only on the horizon, because it has only affected a small potion of the people using crypotcurrencies. However with whole companies offering blockchain analysis, colored coins and increased regulation of bitcoin. Its going to reach a tipping point, where enough people become affected that bitcoins anon reputation disappears. 
Once that occurs bitcoin will be downgraded to just another online payment method and a slow cumbersome one at that. We are already seeing the tech first movers(those who made bitcoin what it is today) moving away from bitcoin, like the creators new  "Banker Trojan Zeus Variant" SPHINX asking to be payed in DASH.

anonymous enough?? that doesn't sound very reassuring considering its constantly promoted as "Anonymous".

The burden of proof varies depending on the type of legal system, but since your clearly american and need to be spoon-fed simple truths.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:19:52
I'm confused so the fact it had mining issues at the start rules it out as a viable altcoin? 
When considering all the improvements it brings to the table? and how little development doge has?
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:21:14
Not to mention it's bitcoin compatible, which is such a massive point. No custom code required for many merchants and business, almost plug and play.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:16:31
In a thread about an altcoin overtaking BTC it is strange to find almost no proper discussion on DASH. Considering it is BTC compatible and has had some serious coding work put into it, but I suppose I expecting anything other than "instamine" from r/bitcoin users was a mistake.

@_date: 2015-10-18 23:48:38
The system doesn't work, there has basically been no real development for years and changing incentives would require consensus then development. So its just a matter of time until Alt's like Dash which are being developed and have consensus methods like the Decentralized Block chain Governance will overtake.

Or use an already functioning [solution]( with a functioning lightning network.

Sigh did you even listen to the podcast!? I mean I was asking for a technical opinion on those ideas. Not your opinion on Darkcoin and its current tech *Facepalm*.
@_date: 2015-10-19 02:39:23
Not a Problem? The node count keeps falling... and so your just gonna hope an alternative to paying for nodes will just appear out of thin air? Not to mention a solution that actually functions well and getting a consensus to implement it(cough XT). 
Edit- They are working on solving the [problem]( and trying to [pay]( people to do it.
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:27:23
It's sad to see so few technical responses to this thread, just ppl plugging their coin or calling scam. Would be great to hear some other coders thoughts on the ideas in this interview.
@_date: 2015-10-19 05:21:14
Such a solution runs into a whole host of problems.
a) You are assuming that people would trust this kind of solution enough to purchase this service
b) That such a scheme would be profitable
c) You assume people willing to pay for this instead of moving to another free payment method
d)The whole mechanism behind such a solution would be incredibly complex e.g. what methodology would be use to verify the connection trying to download blocks has payed?
e) It would be a centralized
However I don't want the discuss the minute of this one non bitcoin protocol solution. My point is simple bitcoin nodes are falling, its development is failing and bitcoins ability to achieve consensus has clearly failed. 
On the other hand there is Dash where there is an already working solution for the nodes problem, a working solution for the consensus problem and continued development.

Christ at least do some research, Amanda has never said she is a developer and all your questions seems to have come from a quick scan of a monero thread. The most trusted of sources.

Lol same article twice on r/bitcoin, the hype is strong.

I am pretty sure they are dead, I have had an open support ticket unanswered since may 5th(46 days) and funds on hold for 53 days on a verified account. I am still waiting for a [response](
