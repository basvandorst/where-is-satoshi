Damn, as someone else pointed out, you need to think about it as purchasing power. If 1 Bitcoin were equal to 1 million US dollars then the purchasing power of the Bitcoin will rise while the purchasing power of the Million dollars will fall.

Lol the shill has feelings. Or is he trolling?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:40:49
Here the shill account is trying to maintain an "everyday man" tone of voice while also instilling doubt against BTC. If anything these accounts make BTC that much stronger, that someone is willing to pay troll accounts to write anti-BTC propaganda.

If r/btc really care about the people they would include flair for accounts &lt; 3 months old. Thank you mods for doing this here.

Trezor has split my accounts into the old account (legacy account) and a new account that supports segwit. Will it matter which account holds my bitcoin during and after this fork?
