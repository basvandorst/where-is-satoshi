This is rather unrelated but you should contact a developer about trying to speed up that page loading time. Research has shown people will quickly lose interest if a page isn't speedy. Enquire about link preloading, HTTP2, possibly caching.
EDIT - oops, just saw you are using Squarespace. Nevermind then.

I mean, it could probably reach McAfee's ridiculous $1m prediction at this rate, but is it actually *worth* that much currently? Absolutely not.

Doesn't having to give an exchange your personal info just invalidate all of that effort?

It's the same for me, but with anonymity networks. I find it disgusting that government agencies can pry on us as they choose. I hope I can contribute someday.

I feel like I'm the only skeptic right now. This is a pretty nuts bull run, and when there's a correction, it's going to be huge. Possibly down to $2000-$2500 again.

It's like Plague Inc - we must infect all the countries with our decentralised organisms &gt;:D

I also become an animated female at 4am. Don't worry, it's normal.

What is that, a toaster?

I think the word *repulsive* fits better.

Yeah, I'm kinda of sketched out about the current bull run. It's going to come down hard at some point - the people who are investing thinking that it's some sort of free money generator are going to pull away.
