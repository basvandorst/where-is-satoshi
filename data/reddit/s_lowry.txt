Fees will get low eventually.


If we hadn't fee problem, I don't think we had so much actual scaling on the pipeline. 2Mb might not affect that at this point, but it wouldn't do much good either.


I'm not sure if you read my post. We don't know what the block size should be. I'm against hard forks and if we must do one, why not do it properly when we know more.
I don't think there really is any rush. I don't care about market cap or mass adoption at this point. We have a good shot at truly decentralized money here. Let's not fuck it up by rushing to something we don't know. The roadmap looks good. LN looks awesome. If other coins beat Bitcoin in popularity contest for a short while, so be it. In the end Bitcoin will be the last one standing.
I also think that most of the community think the way I think so good luck in getting consensus for HF. We will have working LN in main net before that.

It's obvious that Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption. Architecture is not ready although very much is happening right now (LN etc.). It's good that we haven't increased the safety limit yet. This way we see how ecosystem (exchanges etc.) is working.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:50:19


It was never meant to be. Not on base layer.


Yes there is. Decentralization for one.
If all we do is raise the blocksize then we don't really force development and users into other scaling solutions like Lightning Network, Schnor signatures, sidechains, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:06:58

DGB loses to Bitcoin in pretty much every other aspect. And in fees as well if you use LN.
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:38:05
Blockchain is now ~150GB and it's growing little over 1Mb each ten minutes which makes it 144Mb/day and over 50GB/year . With segwit the maximum block size is ~2Mb so it can potentially grow twice the speed. With 8Mb+Segwit it could potentially grow 16MB in ten minutes = 400GB/year. Storage is not as big issue as memory and bandwith though.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:54:21


It's not about that.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:33:35


Why? Bitcoin is still in Beta phase. I think it got too popular too soon. Its very underdeveloped but still way ahead of other coins.


I don't mind having alts around. What I dislike is seeing alts that are trying to lure in suckers with the pitch of "no transaction fees" etc. when their own technology won't really hold up long term even if it seems great on paper. 


No it doesn't. That just means they see it as a possibility to make money. And at the same time they are attacking Bitcoin where it seems to be the most weakest (fees at the moment).


LN won't make anything more complicated. I believe the UI will be very user frendly. And there really is no other solution if we want to keep bitcoins most important properties. I haven't looked into DGB yet but I'm sure it faces all the same problems if enough people start using it (bloating the chain). 


Maybe. But many of us do look into alts when we have time. The truth is, this technology has it's limits and I have yet to see a solution other than scaling in layers.


No one is saying so.

@_date: 2018-01-11 06:20:39
We will have LN before we have consensus for hard fork. Best we can do now for bigger blocks is to push Segwit adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:41:14


If you really are an early adopter, you should know that there is no rush. Bitcoin protocol is not ready for mass adoption yet. It's still closer to being ready than any other coin that is as centralized as Bitcoin.
I agree that Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies became too popular too soon. The protocol should have had time to be developed before people started yelling moon and marketing it to merchants. However I'm very optimistic about LN and other solutions on the pipeline. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:59:20

Cool! I'm still skeptical. Is it deployed using hard fork or soft fork?
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:20:24


Fow a while yes. But at some point, the block chain would have increased too much.
[This]( is a very good reply.
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:30:58


It was an email to Mike Hearn.The man who was against lightning network and proposed a block size increase to 20Mb. There is really no reason for him to fabricate such thing when he was clearly against it. He wanted all transactions on chain and even proposed some kind of blacklists. LN was a threat to that. Therefore when LN was proposed in February 2015 he and Gavin brought the fight to public and proposed increasing the block size limit to 20Mb. Soon ordinary users couldn't even stop a fork because cost of running a node would become too high.
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:04:46
Not increasing the limit now, puts some pressure on making other optimizations for Bitcoin protocol and the ecosystem around it. [This]( is a good example. The fee calculation of most wallets really needs some tweaking as well and we do need some pressure on L2 development.
Also a here is a quote from a [good comment]( I read the other day which summed up my thoughts very well:


And even if 2MB was safe, the fork never is. If we don't have consensus, we risk having two chains and make the situation even more confusing than it already is. And what if we soon find out that 2MB isn't the correct value for the block size limit? We are back arguing for another fork. I'm one of those that believe Bitcoin shouldn't HF unless it's absolutelly necessary and there is clear consensus for it.
I think we need permanent solution for the problem but at this time we don't have enough information to make even educated guesses about how the ecosystem will look like after we have exchausted these other optimizations. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:04:06
It doesn't indeed. But by the looks of the competence of BCH developer team, its unlikely that they could figure out another way to fix malleability.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:58:39


I think that's inevitable. It has always been obvious that there will be other coins. Most coins are just for speculation. Only few has actual value. Nothing to do with Bitcoin or the block size limit.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:06:59
Interesting. I'll have to look into it but I'm skeptical.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:58:56
What coin is more decentralized than Bitcoin?
In what regard are other coins better? Bitcoin has problems but those are being adressed. LN will make the  difference.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:25:34
Another one who doesn't understand that we need to be extremelly careful with the development. We can't just go down the road that "might possibly work". I agree 2Mb might be ok, but if you read and try to understand my post you should see that there are valid reasons for not touching the limit. Atleast I'm not willing to take that risk. And it's obvious at this time that there is no way a HF could achieve consensus before we have LN in action so this whole discussion is pointless.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:05:02


That's not what I mean. The protocol and currency itself must be decentralized.


It will come later.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:09:10


It won't be centralized. Wait a few years. As long as we don't do a hasty bump to safety limit we are all good.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:39:19

As is whole Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:19:49


@_date: 2018-01-10 06:03:47


Actually I do.
He talks nothing about Block size limit there. In his explanation to Mike Hearn he described conceptual Lightning Network (without the routing) using payment channels ("unrecorded open transactions" as Satoshi referred to them).


And to be honest at that time everyone thought that in order to scale, nodes would have to be run in datacenters eventually.
I was here before Hearns famous letter and before Mike and Gavin brought the fight to the public. I was originally in favour of block size increase.
Mike Hearn had his own motives to for wanting to keep transactions on chain. It had become apparent that he wanted to have some form of blacklists, but had to back off after being critiqued of it.
Before the block size debate began, most people thought that scaling would require data centers. Most also didn't like that but accepted it hoping Bitcoin could still remain ungovernable. Because this understanding many people were initially behind Gavin when he took the fight to the community. However after people had better understanding of implications of Lightning Network proposed in February 2015 things changed. People realized that LN could change the whole notion that Bitcoin must scale as a potential Trojan horse. With a blockchain fee market (discussed in the white paper under incentives, and made possible by Satoshi's block limit), and with the routed payment channels, Bitcoin could remain inflation free, well-secured, and practically infinitely scalable without risking becoming governable.
Why, right after the Lightning paper (which showed a better scaling method), did Gavin and Hearn all of the sudden take their fight to the community? It would seem that such a concept should have given them pause, but instead, they acted in furious haste (as though their window of opportunity was closing). Just as Hearn wanted blacklists and no Tor, he wanted all transactions on chain, and LN (and some other development proposals) was a threat to that.
Best way to prevent transactions from going dark is to take the control away from ordinary users. One way to do that is to increase the limit to 20 MB. Soon, ordinary users could not even stop a fork, because they couldn't afford to even run a node.
I think most core developers (and Blockstream) are trying to prevent Bitcoin from going down the path of fiat and financial monitoring.
Getting segwit was win for decentralization. Nothing will stop Bitcoin now. I don't care about current adoption or market cap or temporarily high fees or even if some other coin becomes more popular. In then end Bitcoin will be the last one standing because it's the only truly decentralized coin.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:56:26


Yes so?


Some turned away mostly because volatility (people were returning games etc.), but I agree that fees are an issue as well. Some merchants have said they will return to Bitcoin when LN is ready and it should be soon.


Well that's not true. Altcoin market boomed because Bitcoin boomed. The reason there is so many altcoins is that there are many people in it to gain easy money. Many people buying lottery tickets that have no value long term. I'm not saying all alts are worthless, just that most are. 


Bitcoin is being developed all the time. Increasing the block size limit however risks Bitcoins decentralization and at least I'm not willing to take that risk.

@_date: 2017-12-08 19:20:06


2MB with segwit might not lead to centralization to but 4MB with segwit is too high IMO.


It's easy with data centers where you can just buy bigger drives and more of them. There is no risk involved. But increasing the Block size recklessly could potentially fuck up the whole Bitcoin ecosystem in the long term. There is a possibility that it doesn't, but we must NOT take that risk. Even segwit with the block size increase didn't feel right at first. Luckily the adoption is slow that the blockchain isn't growing as fast as I feared.
BTC is handling scaling the best way possible. Increasing the safety limit is not scaling. It's risking Bitcoins long term safety for temporary band aid.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:10:58
Not really. Node centralization and miner centralization is what matters.
And we all know the miner situation.
Development is pseudo decentralized. Changes to the protocol can be decided by small group of people.
I'm not saying BCH is trash but because poor scaling choices it won't outperform any coin. It lacks important malleability fix needed for off-chain scaling and because the bigger block size, it could easily be attacked by spam and the block chain could be bloated to be huge in few years so that even if there had been node decentralization it would no longer be possible. Nobody bothers though because it's insignificant.
I think it's a good experiment, but it in no way competes with real Bitcoin (or any other coin)
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:05:10


This is where we disagree. Although I admit I can't know how technology advances, I would rather play it safe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:43:52


@_date: 2017-12-14 16:39:12
We have high fees because the value is high. Bigger block wont help. L2 solutions will.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:21:09






It's a protocol. You just don't go changing protocols that are widely used, at least when so much money is involved. Bitcoins immutability is its second most valuable property right after decentralization. People must be able to trust that it just works. I agree that fees are a problem. We still shouldn't risk the whole protocol for a band aid.
I myself have designed software directly on top of TCP and UDP protocols and I have even programmed own transmission protocol for testing purposes. Protocol design is entirely different world from normal software design. And when it comes to Bitcoin and blockchain it is one step more different. There are many more things to consider. It is not just software!
I hate to generalize, but the more I have these discussions with people the more it seems that the big block proponents are lacking knowledge/education about these matters. I myself have university degree in computer science. I have mostly studied programming related to networks. I still don't fully grasp all aspects of the Bitcoin protocol. I have just read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos  and I have been reading a lot of stuff on the internet for example  .
There is still enormous amount for me to study so I can understand all details of the technology.
The more I study the more convinced I am that things like block size limit is something that general public shouldn't even be talking about. That stuff should be left for the developers that have dedicated their time for that. Mike and Gavin really stirred shit when they brought the fight to public.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:10:04
If blockchain grows much faster than it's growing now, ability to run nodes on normal computer over TOR could become impossible. This leads to centralization. Big block proponents don't see that as a problem. They are fine if nodes are run in big datacenters. That however means that bitcoin becomes governable and corruptable.
Decentralization is the most important property of Bitcoin. That's what makes it differet from fiat.

@_date: 2017-12-15 08:10:25
Nah not really.  2MB won't really do much.
I agree that something should be done, but increasing the safety limit is not the answer.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:24:35
Everyone has seen that quote. That's just when he was correcting jgarzics idiotic way to increase the size. No talk about scaling to visa levels.
Satoshis explanation for scaling was basically a conceptual Lightning Network (minus the routing) using payment channels ("unrecorded open transactions").


To be honest many people (maybe even Satoshi) thought that in order for bitcoin to scale, we needed datacenters for running nodes.
That however changed when Lightnin network was proposed in 2015. Bitcoin could remain inflation free, well-secured, and practically infinitely scalable without risking becoming governable.
You may be correct that the block size limit needs to be increased at some point. However we are still lacking data about how much and if it's really even necessary. 
We should make optimizations and implement smarter ways to scale on chain (MAST, Schnorr, etc.) and off chain (LN, sidechains, etc.). And study if we need to increase the limit and how much after we have enough knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:20:32
Amazon is a company. Centralized one. Bitcoin is, and should remain, decentralized. Therefore Bitcoin hasn't got the same privlidges in scaling. Sure we could increase the limit and have nodes be run in datacenters, but it makes bitcoin centralized and governable. 
That should never be allowed to happen!

@_date: 2017-12-31 08:27:30


Even 4MB with segwit could do it. There is no reason to risk the whole network for the small relief it would give. And what if we soon find out that the block size we just forked to isn't good enough (too high, too low). Another fork? 
Or maybe we just try to scale as carefully as we can and accept that it takes time.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:13:18


@_date: 2017-12-19 07:37:28


Still you never offered a valid solution. Increasing the safety limit isn't one


Increasing the limit makes bitcoin corruptible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:03


I'm sorry but I've had this same discussion so many times before already and it's getting tiring. Also I was busy doing other things at the time. 
I think we can both agree that there is a problem. Fees are high. First blocks became full and soon fees were 0.5-1$/transaction. Then the value increased 10x so the fees increased 10x as well.
Now we could increase the block size and maybe the fees would be about half of what they are now (still high) for few months maybe. What do we do then? If we increase the limit further we start risking decentralization which is the most important property of Bitcoin. It is possible that increasing the limit further is ok, but we shouldn't do that unless we can be certain. 
And what happens if bitcoins value increases another tenfold? Fees increase another tenfold. Off-chain scaling is the only way. No other coin has solved this issue. If you know better, please educate me.
Bitcoin became too popular too soon. I wish we had LN by now.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:07:26


No they wouldn't. Fees would decrease yes, but not as much as you seem to think.


The problem here is that the blocks can be spammed full using low fee transactions and in time the blockchain starts bloating. Too risky.


Safe thing to do is to make other optimizations and scale on-chain an off-chain through other means (shnorr, mast, LN etc.), and increase the safetylimit when we have more knowledge of how big it shhould be.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:40:58
So far Bitcoin is the only coin with real solution for scaling.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:07

It's the only way it can work.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:40:47


When everyone in the world uses Bitcoin. We don't need to go there yet and there are other means to scale on-chain than increasing the safety limit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:41:18


Cost is too much. Risk is too big.
Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption anyway. I think it's ok that Steam is no longer supporting Bitcoin. They can asses the situation when the protocol is more ready. 
Scaling must be done very carefully!
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:46:53


Except we risk losing the most important property of bitcoin, decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:39:33

@_date: 2017-12-28 18:58:02


Block size limit can't be increased enough for it to be sufficient long term. LN and other L2 solutions are only way to scale. At least no one has come up with a better solution.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:35:53
LN is coming. What's the point of the post? What do you suggest?
@_date: 2018-09-27 05:18:45


I don't think it's a lie. It was common to think that in order to scale nodes would eventually be run in data centers, however the notion of LN changed that.
Lightning Network that was proposed in February 2015 (just a couple of months before Gavin started the fight), changed the whole notion that Bitcoin must scale as a potential Trojan horse. That is why Gavin and Hearn was suddenly in a rush to increase the block size limit even when there was no actual need for it. And there still isn't.


I think nobody really knows because we can't see the future and how things pan out with Moore's law etc. Core developers just want to be conservative because they want to keep Bitcoin alive and decentralized no matter what. Increasing the block size limit at some point has never been ruled out.
I think that not increasing the limit too early is a good way to put pressure on the whole economy to deploy all other optimizations such as Batching, Bech32, segwit etc. This way the infrastructure is forced to mature. I know some people will disagree.


So am I.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:36:02


Small increase won't do much difference. Scaling must be done by other means. Block size can be increased later.

OMG there definatelly is a risk! You can't be so sure about how the world will look 20 or 50 years from now. Even at 1MB the Blockchain is growing rapidly. I agree that if we make a bet that with 4MB+segwit Bitcoin does fine next 50 years, you could be right. But we shouldn't bet the whole ecosystem for that! Never! That is something you seem to be unable to understand.

@_date: 2017-12-12 18:30:40


Can you give me an example?


Why do you think that?


What gave you the impression I think it works like that. It seems like you are not really reading what I write, instead you are painting false a picture of what I might think in your own head. I have been talking about roadmap and I know Bitcoin protocol will evolve. Almost all updates should be backwards compatible though. Even Satoshi was in favour of soft forks and wanted to avoid hard forks.


Sure , I'm not saying otherwise although I'm not sure what you mean anymore.


This kind of remarks will only weaken your credibility.


That's not what I'm saying at all. Sorry, I don't speak english natively so you may have misinterpreted what I was meaning to say. LN will most likely alleviate the problem of needing to make fees lower and still give miners enough in fees. 


In what way?


If your solution is to increase block size, then I'm glad it hasn't happened. That's not incompetence. That's smart.


I'm not following anyone blindly. I read and learn. 


Maybe because I have made huge gains these past two years, I don't really see the problem. Also 99% of the developers that know Bitcoin better than anyone don't want to increase the block size.


It's not a bad thing. There is more than enough room for alts. 


I own BCH. I sold most, but I still have some.


LOL. I have some LTC yes. I have owned cryptocurrencies for 4 years now. At the moment I'm very glad I own LTC. Past few days have been very nice. It's not as good as BTC technically but it's better than BCH which still hasn't fixed transaction malleability problem. I own monero, zcash, eth, etc, dash and some other coins as well (even BTG).


Good luck! 
PS. No need to answer my questions. It won't lead anywhere anyway.

Competition will face same problems as soon as the usage is even near same level as in Bitcoin. Bitcoin (and maybe LN and other Segwit coins) is so far only coin with real solution to scaling.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:40:48


Yes, but it's easy to spam blocks full using low fee transactions. 


Sure I'm ok with mass adoption eventually. But I also think that bitcoin still needs alot of development work before mass adoption should happen. And I think that micro and nanotransactions should not be settled on chain.
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:28:54
The video you linked didn't appear here for good reasons. I saw it and I have seen it before. Now I somewhat understand how you could have been persuaded to think the way you do. If someone with not much knowledge about bitcoin and it's development stublmes accros those videos it can be easy to be fooled to believe the propaganda they are spreading. However the more you read about bitcoin (try reading [this]( for example), you start seeing through the bullshit that is being spread. The code is for everyone to see. Everyone can contribute. All new ideas are being discussed.
Economic majority has just decided that it's better to go for more conservative route and make sure bitcoin keeps it's most important properties and that it can't be governed. The BCH side on the other hand has chosen a different route. They accept that it becomes another paypal that is controlled from the top so that they can have all the transactions on-chain. That's just not what Bitcoin is supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:58:04


Sure. I know there isn't one.

@_date: 2017-12-19 14:37:59
If LN doesn't work and nothing better comes up then fine. Bitcoin can't scale.
Increasing the block size limit is just delaying the inevitable while making Bitcoin a little more centralized.

What do you base that assumption on?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:47:52


Nope. We have segwit and it's enough. And Steam is not making the decision based on fees alone. Volatility is mentioned as well.


slightly less decentralization is 100x worse and it should be obvious.


Steam not supporting Bitcoin for now is not a big deal.
Bitcoin is hardly ready for mass adoption. No cryptocurrency is.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:54:47


It's many times better comparison than Amazon, file server or some other software. When you say Bitcoin is just a software and same principles apply than other software design, you are wrong. It's many times more complicated. You are right it's not TCP either. TCP is simple compared to Bitcoin.


Some amount of backlog is needed in order for miners to get paid after mining reward becomes obsolete. Already after 1-2 halvings miners should be getting more from transaction fees than block reward. 
"Additionally, the miner is awarded the fees paid by users sending transactions. The fee is an incentive for the miner to include the transaction in their block. In the future, as the number of new bitcoins miners are allowed to create in each block dwindles, the fees will make up a much more important percentage of mining income. " Quoted from [here](
[The bitcoin inflation rate steadily trends downwards. At the time of writing, more than 3 out of every 4 bitcoins that will ever exist has already been mined, and the annual inflation rate is just 4%. The block reward given to miners is made up of newly-created bitcoins plus transaction fees. As inflation goes to zero miners will obtain an income only from transaction fees which will provide an incentive to keep mining to make transactions irreversible.](
If all transactions fit in block there is no incentive to pay fees.




As long as it takes. There is no rush. Bitcoin is not going anywhere. It fills it's purpose as store of value until we have layers on top of it providing many other use cases. I suspect we will have working Lighning network sometime next year. There is also on-chain scaling being done (Schnorr, MAST) and Segwit adoption should keep increasing. 


I have no idea what point you're trying to make here.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:03:05


There is no such thing.


There is. 


That's the problem of on-chain scaling alone. That's one of the reasons BCH has no future unless they start scaling off-chain.
LN and other possible L2 solutions where multiple transactions are bundled together alleviate that problem. When the value of one bitcoin increases, the fees (in $) increase obviously. That's what has happened already. Backlog is not the only thing to be blamed for the high fees. 
Block size limit could be used as a balancing instrument when we have other optimizations and some layer 2 solutions ready, but right now it should be left untouched.


And it won't be in the future. We need to be patient.


Steam ditched Bitcoin mostly due to volatility. People were returning games after bitcoin had increased in value in short time period. Steam was losing money because of that. But yes fees were/are an issue as well.


That might be true. However Bitcoin still is digital cash. I can send money from Finland to my frend in Indonesia without any third party. That wasn't possible before bitcoin. Right now there are other coins that can do it cheaper (LTC), but eventually other coins face the same problems if they become as widely used as Bitcoin. So far Bitcoin is the only coin with scaling road map that most likely succeeds.


Tesla works fine even if it's not perfect. Bitcoin works fine even if it's not perfect. I doubt Elon Musk would increase Teslas driving range using something that treathens the whole project. And it's still silly comparison. It's easy to do testing and risk only one Tesla. But in Bitcoin, even if we have testnets and other coins where things can be tested we can't test everything.  If we make modifications to actual Bitcoin chain, those modifications will have consequences that could become problems years from now. Increasing the safety limit is a modification that for me makes no sense to have right now. It's pointless risk.
It's been fun but you are right, we aren't going to see eye to eye on this. I still hope you're open minded and try to see things from my perspective. It's good that we have other coins (BCH,LTC) as well. Future will show who's right and who's wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:15:23


Hearn and Gavin proposed 20MB.


95% of the developers.


They are mandatory regardless the block size limit. There really is no other way if we want nodes being run on normal computers.


This is not true. Didn't you read the link I posted:
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:01:56
What happens if/when bitcoins value increases another ten fold and fees increase 10x ?
LN is the only solution.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:58:25


I'm not arguing against this, but I don't see how it's relevant. Bitcoin is being developed all the time. LN is being developed all the time. Things take time. There still is no justification for block size limit increase.


No they are not. They compliment eachother. Each coin brings something to the table. Ideologically I don't care which coin wins as long as it's centralized, immutable and can be used without trusting third party. At the moment I believe Bitcoin is strongest in these properties. My other investments are just investments. I believe some of they may have some real value in some use cases but Bitcoin&gt;*


I was here before Hearns famous letter and before Mike and Gavin brought the fight to the public. I was originally in favour of block size increase.
Mike Hearn had his own motives to for wanting to keep transactions on chain. It had become apparent that he wanted to have some form of blacklists, but had to back off after being critiqued of it.
Before the block size debate began, most people thought that scaling would require data centers. Most also didn't like that but accepted it hoping Bitcoin could still remain ungovernable. Because this understanding many people were initially behind Gavin when he took the fight to the community. However after people had better understanding of implications of Lightning Network proposed in February 2015 things changed. People realized that LN could change the whole notion that Bitcoin must scale as a potential Trojan horse. With a blockchain fee market (discussed in the white paper under incentives, and made possible by Satoshi's block limit), and with the routed payment channels, Bitcoin could remain inflation free, well-secured, and practically infinitely scalable without risking becoming governable.
Why, right after the Lightning paper (which showed a better scaling method), did Gavin and Hearn all of the sudden take their fight to the community? It would seem that such a concept should have given them pause, but instead, they acted in furious haste (as though their window of opportunity was closing). Just as Hearn wanted blacklists and no Tor, he wanted all transactions on chain, and LN (and some other development proposals) was a threat to that.
Best way to prevent transactions from going dark is to take the control away from ordinary users. One way to do that is to increase the limit to 20 MB. Soon, ordinary users could not even stop a fork, because they couldn't afford to even run a node.
I think most core developers are trying to prevent Bitcoin from going down the path of fiat and financial monitoring.

This should be obvious. Decentralization makes everything more difficult. If we didn't have to worry about decentralization we could increase the limit to 1GB and become paypal2. That just doesn't make any sense. Blocks would still be found once in 10 minutes average. Paypal wins anyway. When Bitcoin loses decentralization, it no longer is Bitcoin. Sure we could increase the limit a bit at some point. Technology advances, but we can't trust that. We shouldn't trust anything than math and cold hard evidence. And we must value decentralization above all. Therefore we must be very conservative and truly know what we are doing and what are the effects long term.

2MB won't solve anything. Did you read this:
We need L2 solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:39:48


I think there are two problems:
1. It is possible, even propable that 2MB doesn't risk decentralization in any way. However I wouldn't be willing to make that bet using the whole ecosystem for the small relief in fees that 2MB would bring. Also not increasing the limit now, puts some pressure on making other optimizations for Bitcoin protocol and the ecosystem around it. [This]( is a good example. The fee calculation of most wallets really needs some tweaking as well and we do need some pressure on L2 development.
2. Even if 2MB was safe, the fork never is. If we don't have consensus, we risk having two chains and make the situation even more confusing than it already is. And what if we soon find out that 2MB isn't the correct value for the block size limit? We are back arguing for another fork. I'm one of those that believe Bitcoin shouldn't HF unless it's absolutelly necessary and there is clear consensus for it.

Nobody is doing that. And when you talk about tx speed you are really showing your lack of understanding. I think you mean limiting the amount of transactions that can be fit into a block.

Even 8MB could be a problem. Blockchain is already huge and growing fast even when blocks are ~1MB.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:31:00
High fees are due to popularity. First transactions hit the safetylimit and fees were $0.5 - $1 and then value increased tenfold and so did fees.
Other coins will face similar problems. L2 is the solution. Only solution in the long term.

Umm no. There's hardly any transactions in BCH chain. I just looked it up yesterday. Nobody uses it. There may be some increased exchange volume, but that's just speculation and could very well be manipulation.
There is really nothing that BCH does better than BTC. It's not as decentralised and secure. It doesn't have any real scaling. It has no long term future, because the philosophy behind it is "adoption first -&gt; profit" whereas philosophy in Bitcoin development is to first build solid foundation and carefully develop the infrastructure in all areas and let the adoption come slowly as the protocol gets more ready. Bitcoin is community driven whereas BCH is pretty much controlled from the top.

LN transactions are almost free. On-chain transactions cost 0.05$ at the time. And if people are willing to pay more to transact in Bitcoin, that means they value Bitcoin above other currencies.


It doesn't.


Maybe the situation is a bit too difficult for you to understand. If I owned a bank and had a lot of money and there was this Bitcoin thing that could potentially be a big threat to banking I'd invest in it as a some kind insurance that I'd be still left with something if that Bitcoin thing succeeds. I'm sure many banks have invested in Bitcoin after they have realized it's not so easy to attack at.
Keeping the block size limit in place is the one thing preventing it from becoming governed by the rich elite.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:33:32


If you are talking about market cap, that was bound to happen. Money drives people. Therefore there are many who are trying to get rich by making new coins or/and investing in them. Also Bitcoin already being "expensive" has made some other coins appear better investments. Mostly it's just lottery, but thats how it goes. If you look at value being transacted, bitcoin still holds it's dominance very well and will be doing it in the future as well.

Yes there is and if you had followed the discussion around the topic you'd know this. There are very good reasons not to hard fork. Even increasing block size via softwork is not entirely safe. That's why SegWit is a compromise and many people would like it better without the block size increase.

OK, I believe that contentious HF will split the chain and have huge negative effect on Bitcoins value. I also believe all HF:s should be contentius because immutability is the most important property of Bitcoin. And even if hard fork could be done safely, in order to keep bitcoin ungovernable the cost of running a node should be low enough to operate over Tor with normal computers.


Still are!


The argument hasn't shifted. Segwit is a compromise as I said.
It's ok we disagree. When you say there is nothing wrong with increasing block size limit via hard fork, maybe you truly believe so. Big part of dev community however believes otherwise.
We should be very carefull before making irreversible changes to protocol. That's why I think SegWit -&gt; LN.. etc. is the best route for now.
@_date: 2017-02-05 12:26:01


There have been plenty of analysis of that. I think Cornell study suggested that 4Mb might be highest safe block size limit at this moment. Making hasty HF is still not worth the risk. There are so many other things to consider. That's why SegWit is perfect for this moment (if we need capacity increase at all yet).

But what issue has bitcoin as a protocol had over an year? Is it not performing as it should? Is some technical issue somehow crippling bitcoin? Because at the moment I don't see any. Instead I see alot of FUD.
@_date: 2017-02-04 12:27:12
What does this have to do with the discussion?
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:33:25


Not a good idea.


I don't believe it has.
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:28:16
Segwit doubles the block size and schnorr increases the throughput even more.  Block size increase via HF isn't urgent and can't be done until everyone agrees we need it.
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:34:35


Why do you think that?

I think everyone should try both atleast once.
@_date: 2016-03-16 12:40:16




 
What if bitcoin fails because some technical issue when it has been more widely adopted by the masses or governance related issues because the adoption happened too soon. Don't you think it should be as ready as possible first? The protocol is far from ready yet. And I believe developers are not just sitting on their asses. I think they're doing all they can to make bitcoin more ready.




That's not what I'm saying at all. We should definatelly make it capable as soon as possible, but it takes time.






The world is not going anywhere.
What are the competing decentralised systems at the moment?
Ultimately I'm just hoping long life for bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:17:03


Well this is where we disagree. I think it would be better to perfect the protocol before mass adoption. Making changes using forks will become even more difficult as bicoin gains more users without technical understanding. I don't mind really. I think immutability is the most important property of Bitcoin.

But is it too slow to adapt? Whose fault is it if some people are lacking patience?
Isn't SegWith supposed to be ready before halving? And LN later this year?
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:38:12
Umm no. What you are quoting requires a HF. Why do you think we're having the debate at all if it was so easy to increase the limit?
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:39:22
L2 solutions will happen regardless of BU or SegWit or Core or Blockstream. That can't really be stopped. There really is no other way to have small and almost instant low fee transactions.
On-chain scaling must happen as well. SegWit is good and then we have schnorr signatures. At some point when developers have decent plan for HF, we might have increase in block size. But it's not really that urgent.
@_date: 2016-03-27 17:18:33


For example what features?
@_date: 2016-03-26 08:40:06


What do you mean too slowly? What opportunities have been lost? You state it's a fact without providing any proof.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:31:07
The sad truth is on-chain transactions in Bitcoin were never meant to stay free. Increased fees only mean increased adoption. It's unfortunate that some people thought it was going to stay that way, but there are technical tradeoffs to consider. Bitcoin needs to stay decentralized so it has value in the future. Even Satoshi and Hal Finney had visions of smaller transactions going off-chain eventually. 
Many people ask: "why don't we just increase block size?" It's not done because it's so controversial that it can't be done even if most core devs wanted. Segwit atleast has some change to get deployed.
I believe LN could come pretty soon but we need segwit first.
@_date: 2016-03-28 06:35:57




I don't see any problem with that. It's nice to see other coins doing well too.


There is so much infrastructure and investments around Bitcoin that E***** has a long way ahead before it threats Bitcoins position. Are there any businesses that actually use other coins? Could I buy something with E*****?


I'm well aware of the things you mentioned. I just don't make such big deal out of it. It seems I have more confidence in Bitcoin than you do. Intresting to see what'll happen during next 12-18 months.
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:23:33
SegWit increases the block size wich is the compromise.
@_date: 2016-03-27 15:30:57
Left side first and maybe right side later.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:34:27
Segwit first and then we'll see what we need. At the moment I wouldn't want to see any kind of HF and I hope someone will come up with a solution where HF can be avoided.
But if it needs to happen, it should include other improvements as well than just a block size increase. Also I think 4 is too high atleast for now.
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:50:59


Ofcourse he is. But the problem is in the way he is doing it. One stakeholder shouldn't have so much power. Core and this sub includes hundreds of users. No single entity is in control and never should be. That's what I want to avoid.
@_date: 2016-03-16 06:07:18
Bitcoin should not strive for mass adoption until it's truly resilient to handle the masses. We need to be patient.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:00:02


They have shown. Segwit is just that. I'm sure many would have preferred it without the block size increase.

They have provided SegWit. Now it's up to miners.
Other way to increase block size limit requires a hard fork. And hard fork to 2MB may seem simple but it's not. Getting consensus for SegWit first seems alot more possible than getting consensus for hardfork.

@_date: 2017-03-27 10:17:43


No-one knows the future. That's why we need to be very carefull with scaling. If technology magically advances faster than anticipated, good. Maybe there will be room for bigger blocks in the future. But we can't count on that. Atleast when 1Mb+segwit will give us enough room for a while. Snhorr+LN etc. will help us even more.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:26:43


That would have been horrible. After years you still refuse to understand risks of hard fork and bigger block size limit.


When has there been stalling? Only miners are stalling if they don't signal segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:11:36


If you look more closely you'll realise it's exactly the opposite. They are the rational ones.


How is user experience any better if block size limit is 2 MB or 4 MB? Please explain to me so I understand. Fees may be a bit lower with bigger block sizes, but we do need fee market. 
And small, instant, low fee transactions must be done off-chain anyway. Blocks are still found once in 10 minutes average. Can take up to an hour and that's only one confirmation. So on chain scaling won't really have such a big effect some people seem to think.  Better user experience comes from LN. 
Segwith doubles the Blocksize and schnorr signature increases the throughput even more. We should go the safe route and not take unnecessary risks and make irreversible changes. HF is very risky and needs carefull preparation. Too high block size limit is risky. Segwit is a compromise. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:23:39


I can do this.


Not true.


May be true, but that's the way bitcoin works.


I don't believe this is true. Most times 0.7$ is enough. Sometimes a bit more is needed.


I don't think this is true. 
Also Core has awesome roadmap. Safe and smart scaling. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:13:54

Anyone can create that "coordinating authority". Everyone benefits from LN, ofcourse Blockstream as well.

I have understood that it's not. Atleast not designed as such originally. So maybe people who don't like that, should start their ofn system.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:39:19


But it's not upto them. Even if majority of Core devs wanted a HF many users would be against it. And it's not smart to propose something that is so controversial. 
There was a survey posted two days ago in both reddit subs. 
And even if there nothin prevents multiple votes, the result gives view of what community thinks.
Only ~14% feels 2Mb+segwit is acceptable. Even "Emerging Consensus" got more votes and Segwit seems to be the most popular blocksize increase.
I myself see no point in HF. Not now. Maybe when someone proposes a HF that solves more problems that it introduces and maybe solves scaling alltogether. But understandably no-one has come up with such an update. Segwit does what HF to 2Mb does, but it does it better and solves other problems as well.
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:42:30

@_date: 2017-03-02 20:13:43
I'll answer incase you are not trolling but actually think that's the way things are.
a) Block size needs to be small enough so  we can run nodes on normal computers over tor, in order to kee bitcoin ungovernable.
b) bigger than 1M is not really needed at this point, but I could agree to 2M (segwit)
c) backlog is actually a good thing for fee market.
Hard fork should be avouded until it is actually necessary because it splits the chain and in worst case can destroy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:56:31


How democratic is it really when Bitmain has so much power over it? I think it needs to be fixed. I don't know if UASF is the way to go, but something should be done.

He is trying to affect to the way other miners signal. That is a problem.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:38:11


At this point bigger than 2M or maybe 4M endangers the whole blockchain and I don't see hard fork as an option.
 
But even if 100M was possible, it would still take ~10 minutes (can take up to an hour) to mine a block. So we can't see nearly instant transactions even if blocks were 100M. So we need LN to make bitcoin more appealing to masses.


Unfortunatelly thats not reality. Not on-chain (atleast yet). Until someone figures out some way, there is no point in having a risky and irreversible hard fork. Not when we have means to scale safely through segwit and LN.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:39:23


Big part of the community think that is too big increase.
@_date: 2017-03-01 06:13:39


It's been used alot in propaganda.


It wasn't the original plan. I don't know how you can draw that kind of conclusion. He was just giving one easy to understand way to increase throughput. And the post has been taken out of context. He was all for side chaings and off-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:50:51












They have and the solution is waiting for activation.




Indeed! Segwit is the solution! We don't need additional increase at this time.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:15:57


I think that is just short-sighted of them. I'd like to think that what's best for Bitcoin in long term is also best for miners in long term. I don't know about Jihan, maybe your assessment is correct and we really need to have UASF. I only wish someone from core would have tried to have a conversation with him (I don't know it it's been tried).
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:25:13


That's what segwit is. If you mean additional increase to limit using HF, then the problem is HF.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:34:13
I believe some miners left antpool and some of them switched to pools that signal segwit.

Refuting the refute of refute
1. 
2. Why would core attack anyone. They just code and let the community choose.
3. Ofcourse blockchain can be spammed to make blocks appear full. I'm not sure if it's happening though.
4.  Not sure what your point is?
5. Umm no! In HF the whole economy really needs to upgrade. Ofcourse it doesn't require much from users but it will be a mess for merchants, exchanges and other stakeholders. In segwit there is no fear for anyone. Don't really know where you got that idea.
6. Moderation != cencorship. And even if there was cencorship technical merits of code is what should matter.
7. What?
8. Again I don't understand what your refuting here? Are you argeeing?
9. Nobody has said that. Only miners want higher fees and are trying to block segwit.
10. Cores intention is to secure Bitcoin. Higher (&gt;4-8Mb) block size limit is a threat to that. That's why they have tried to find secure ways to scale.  Segwit, shnorr, sidechains LN etc..
11. I don't really understand what that has to do with anything really.
12. If there is no attack, It's a no brainer that Core side will win.

@_date: 2017-03-25 09:48:06


No they don't. They just wan't to have nice fees and are afraid that 2nd layer applications are a threat to that. And that's totally understandable but a bit shortsighted IMO.
Big miners like BU because it gives them the power to adjust the fees through adjusting Blocksize. They don't like segwit because it provides malleability fix needed for sidechains, LN and other layer 2 development.
From users point of view segwit is no brainer.
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:27:27
The fees at the moment are a bit high, atleast for smaller transactions (I don't mind paying 0.5$ fees when I send 1 bitcoin). 
I have understood that LN would be mainly used for these smaller transactions. Pushing these offchain makes room in blocks and fees for bigger transactions will also be lower. I still wouldn't still say it's hurting fee market. Increasing block size limit makes fees lower with less benefits and more risks.
Bigger blocks allow more transactions but doesn't magically make people use Bitcoin any more. LN on the other hand has great possibility to provide platform for new userfriendly applications and can make almost instant low fee transactions possible. More use cases -&gt; more ways to attract new users. When big blockers argue that we need bigger blocks to have more users, they fail to explain how excactly bigger blocks attract new users.
More users also mean more fees.
And blockstream isn't getting the fees!

I don't think HF will gain consensus until it's absolutelly necessary.

@_date: 2017-03-07 15:40:32
I'm pretty sure big part of core devs didn't want to increase block size limit. And that's what segwit does. That's the compromise.
I support core and I'm fine with segwit never happening.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:43:17


Segwit is the cleanest solution presented so far.
@_date: 2017-03-23 06:27:50
And getting miner consensus for soft fork is so easy? Maybe you are right that they would rather lower the limit than increase it.
But that's not really the whole story. 
Blockchain begins to bloat when blocks are increased. And when it begins to be a problem it might be too late to decrease the limit. Also by then, the bigger block size might actually be justifiable because higher on-chain transaction demand.
It's not as simple as you make it seem.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:50:02


Big part of devs and community doesn't want to see HF. Atleast not until we have seen SegWit and LN in action.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:51:21


It has nothing to do with the moderation here.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:30:17
Because economic majority agrees that original BTC chain is the way to go even if miners think otherwise. Hashrate will follow eventually because mining BU will be worthless. Biggest problem here is that we are left with two different coins. Bitcoin will lose most of its value due to losing trust of investors. Immutability really is important!

I'm fully aware of that. But I hope you understand how much work a succesfull hard fork reguires from the whole ecosystem. And how much more difficult it is to gather consensus for it. Right now even if the proposal and code for HF came from core, I doubt we would see consensus within an year. And BU won't happen for sure.
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:08:00
It works fine now. We need backlog. We need fee market. Blocks being full is not a problem. Ofcourse we need scaling, but there is no rush yet.

Miners have had the power to change that for a while now. UASF may be the answer. Or what do you suggest? Safe HF will take alot more time than getting segwit activated, because it requires user consensus as well as miner consensus, and many people don't want to see HF happening.


I don't see that being a problem. Atleast not yet.

I haven't studied much what satoshi did and wrote those times so
I'm not sure if he ever really talked about inceasing the limit other than showed an example how it can be done in code. He did say: "I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea." And that he didn't want to fork.  But that's just as relevant today as the post where he showed the code for increasing the limit.
I can post you a discussion about satoshis plans that includes links to explanations Satoshi gave Mike Hearn. Here:
The more I study the matter the more I'm convinced he wished to implement payment channels and wasn't keen on touching the 1MB safetylimit. And it looks to me that LN is just advanced version of what he had in mind.
Study yourself and make your own conclusions. Nobody really knows what he/they had in mind.

Umm ok, so when you talk about LN transactions you mean network structure, but when you talk about on-chain transactions you don't mean network structure.
I mean think about it. The network structure in LN is what the name implies, network of nodes that forward transactions whereas Bitcoin on-chain transactions are broadcasted to all nodes in the network.
If we stop thinking about the network structure as that's not what whitepaper means (agreed) then both are as much peer-to-peer electronic cash systems. In LN you can even open a channel directly to your recipient (can be done without LN as well), which makes it more peer-to-peer.
And to be honest I don't really think any of this even makes any difference. It doesn't matter at all. It's just narrative that tries to hide the facts that really matter.
* LN is more private than Bitcoin on-chain.
* LN is more fungible than Bitcoin on-chain.
* LN is faster than Bitcoin on chain.
* LN increases the capacity of the Bitcoin system by several orders of magnitude.
* LN preserves the principles of trustlessness that Bitcoin has
LN does have it's problems and it's not perfect but trying to downplay it by saying it's not peer-to-peer doesn't make any sense.

The truth is only handfull of people made an agreement. I didn't sign it. None of core devs signed it. Big part of businesses didn't sign it. Majority of miners did. And I believe many of the businesses/miners that did sign it wouldn't agree with it anymore now that there is actual implementation to be seen.

Which is what is giving incentive to exchanges etc. to implement optimizations. If we had just increased the safety limit, nothing would happen and we needlessly bloat the blockchain.
Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin ecosystem are far from ready. We need to find the most resource conservative ways to use this technology. Bitcoin developers and developers that are developing the surrounding technology are forced to innovate. It can still be done without harming the user experience much because there are hardly any users. At this point bitcoin still is a "nerd thing" and big part of the community consists of people with at least some technical knowledge. If we have full blocks and higher fees for few weeks,  it's acceptable at this point. However if bitcoin stops being just a speculative asset and a nerd playground and if it gains some real adoption, we have to have solved many of the problems still existing.
I myself would have hoped that bitcoin didn't become even this popular so soon. That has brought more developers to this community, but it has also brought a loud handfull of people that doesn't even seem to want to understand the technology and are still forming strong opinions about how it should be developed.
Also if we eventually hard fork, we should do other improvements to the protocol as well.
There is a [wishlist]( but I'm sure developers will find more things to include in it as time passes. That's one reason to delay it as much as possible.
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:21:31


But in same way Bitcoin on-chain is not peer-to-peer as the payment is broadcasted. Didn't you read what I wrote?


But it is as much peer-to-peer as Bitcoin on-chain. How can you not see it? Have you tried LN? You send your transaction to your peer as in Bitcoin. In LN it goes through some nodes and on-chain it gets broadcasted. But in users perspective both are peer-to-peer even when the network structure is not peer-to-peer in either.
And as I said, the whole discussion is pointless because it doesn't matter in any way. It's just semantics. It's not a bad thing that Bitcoin transactions are broadcasted and it's not a bad thing that LN transactions are routed through x amount of nodes. IT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL.

People like to diversify their investment portfolio and buying altcoins with spare Bitcoin is now easier than ever. Also other coins have different use cases (Ethereum) and have been gaining some traction. It's only a good thing that other coins are becoming more popular as well. It's natural development.


I don't think that has nothing to do with it. What are the other coins people can actually use for buying stuff at the moment? and what can be bought with altcoins? I know there are some use cases, but those are rare. High transaction fee means that people are really using bitcoin (spam or not). 
Core has very good scaling roadmap and we will see some relief in transaction fees. Atleast more than we could ever achieve with HF to 2MB block size limit.

No. If that were the case, why would other coins drop even more?


Bitcoin is community driven so blockstream is not taking bitcoin anywhere without consensus from community.


Nobody who understands bitcoin says so. The truth is more the opposite. They are trying to keep bitcoin from becoming easily governed by keeping the base layer decentralized and encouraging scaling on other layers. Most exchanges are already centralized so Liquid doesn't affect that. Increasing the block size limit needlessly however could make bitcoin resemble fiat in time.

The fault in this is that small blockers don't want to add unknown code prematurely either. And nobody wants to constrain the natural growt of the network. I myself want to make sure that Bitcoin stays ungovernable and I think increasing the limit is a risk to that.

The thing is the limit has served us well. We don't need to increase it yet.
Not increasing the limit too early is a good way to put pressure on the whole economy to deploy all other optimizations such as Batching, Bech32 etc. This way the infrastructure is forced to mature. We know we can increase the limit at some point. We have just chosen the more conservative path.

The value of making sure the network can be trusted by being part in validating it. That's the whole point of Bitcoin - decentralization and removing the trust in third party. I think it's essential that the chain is validated by as many as possible. Datacenters are too easily governed.  Look what's already started happening in mining.
If bitcoin can be governed, there is no more value in it. There is no point. Why not just use Fiat then.

I think everyone here is for on-chain scaling. There are however many ways to scale on-chain and there really is no reason to increase the safetylimit at this point. 
We should see what kind of an effect does Schnorr, MAST and off-chain scaling have and evaluate the situation then. With the information we have now, how can we evaluate the correct size for the block size limit? What if we soon realize we need a HF anyway? Wouldn't it make more sense to have more improvements than just 2MB increase to the safetylimit when we actually do need to HF. 
I really think that HF should be very carefully planned and only after we have more information about the effects of other scaling methods and even then the activation should be 12-18 months from the release. That's why I object the 2x part of Segwit2x. I just don't see the urgency.
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:11:09


Because the activation method gave few mining pools power to block it. Core devs made a mistake to think no miner would object it. It seems like you haven't really paid attention.

@_date: 2017-08-23 09:57:38
If you mean increasing the safetylimit, that's not really a solution. 
Bitcoin can't significantly scale on chain without losing its main properties. We can do some minor scaling (SegWit, Schnorr, MAST and maybe even moderate bump to the safetylimit at some point), but the technology has it's limits. Off-chain scaling is the only way if we want to have small, fast and low-fee transactions done using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:18:07


No there isn't. The issue there is even worse. It has no segwit and L2 scaling is far behind. Increasing the safetylimit is not the answer.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:36:32

I'm not saying it will. 2Mb blocks might be just fine. I just don't think safe HF is possible in current climate.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:30:39
Who will mine BCH when mining reward gets closer to 0? There must be fee market, surely you must understand this. The problem of BCH is that not many will be able to run a node in BCH after few years if blocks are 4-8M. But we won't see that because there will never be so many transactions to fil those Blocks. It will work ok because of lack of usage.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:04:04
But there are. It will break the network because there is no consensus. 3 months is far too soon. Why cant Segwit2x devs implement replay protection?
And what good does 2x give us? Not really much of anything that can't be achieved many times more with smarter and more careful scaling. There are so many better ways to scale but for some reason many people are stuck with the block size limit (or block weight limit after SegWit).
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:32:43
What's HF to 2Mb other than a very risky band-aid?
We eventually need a real solution. No-one has just come up with decent one yet.
SegWit gives us time, schnorr signature gives us time and LN makes things even better. By then we might have better overall solutions that don't risk the whole ecosystem.

If they are silent, how can you know this?
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:11:34

@_date: 2017-08-05 09:44:11
Nope. They definatedly should't make a BIP until the effects of better on- and off-chain scaling solutions have beed studied and before we have enough information of how much the limit should be increased if at all.

How do you know that? There are very good arguments against rushed HF and there are very good arguments against increasing the Block size limit. All these have been discussed many times here already and if you had paid attention to the discussion you should know that there are serious risks in hard forks. And increasing the limit is a risk to decentralisation. The blockchain is already growing at fast rate and some have argued that 1MB limit is already too high.

@_date: 2017-08-25 18:18:42
At the moment some miners are mining empty blocks and switching to mining altcoin and back. Switching causes there to be less blocks mined for a while until difficulty gets adjusted. And mining empty blocks only makes the situation even worse. Those are the reasons why confirmation times and fees are higher than normal.

Even if increasing the block size limit is OK, SegWit2x is not. What you wrote indicates that you are not very well informed or you are deliberately trying to cause confusion.
In case the first is true:
Biggest issues with Segwit2x are a lack of replay protection and the missed opportunity to fix some other things while we are hard forking. And of course the timetable that is far too rushed for an update that isn't backwards compatible.
And even if it would be OK technically, it's being forced to users in an unacceptable way. It is far too controversial to be safe.
[This Sybil-resistant survey]( gives some idea of how the ones who do know something feel about NYA and forks in general. 75% disagree with NYA. Most users do not oppose block size increase at some point but most seem to oppose it now (at the time of the survey)
The survey and [this]( are information enough for me to be sure that if 2x goes through as it is now, it will be a disaster to bitcoin. Nothing good will happen.
And what good does 2x give us? Not really much of anything that can't be achieved many times more with smarter and more careful scaling. There are so many better ways to scale but for some reason many people are stuck with the block size limit (or block weight limit after SegWit).
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:32:44


No they wouldn't. Increasing the limit to 4-8Mb could in time make running a node  using normal computer very difficult. We could lose decentralization which is the most important property of Bitcoin. It is what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. It will become paypal2.
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:14:41


I think it's simple solution for very complicated problem.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:23:04


Sure. But Bitcoin surely is resilient enough. BCH on the other hand might be in trouble if hashrate leaves it now. Maybe they'll hard fork.
@_date: 2016-12-14 11:13:49


Transactions will not just magically happen when fees are lowered.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:42:14
Hardly anyone uses BCH so no wonder the fees are low.
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:37:38
We eventually need a real solution. No-one has just come up with decent one yet.
SegWit gives us time, schnorr signature gives us time and LN makes things even better. By then we might have better overall solutions that don't risk the whole ecosystem. 


Blocks being full is not a problem.
@_date: 2016-11-20 08:01:13
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:02:54


For the current situation they do. I agree that the fees were a bit high even before, but I have always managed to transfer using max 1$ fees before. And for this we would have had relief much sooner if miners had signaled segwit earlier. Core devs made a mistake to use miner support for the activation. But we will get some scaling going and the fees will decrease.
@_date: 2016-11-19 15:58:09
I have understood he has, but he chooses not to. I believe he said it himself some time ago.
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:00:19


They have only gained knowledge of how bad idea 20Mb or 8Mb would be.


SWSF is truly a compromise, and I believe many core developers would rather have it without the Block size limit increase.
@_date: 2016-11-19 23:35:52


Umm no.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:36:58
yea it was unfortunate that some miners chose to mine one altcoin which made the fees rise. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:40:48


Segwit increases Block size limit to 2-4MB. Doubling that gives some additional relief, but doesn't really solve anything. Atleast we need to study it more.
Here is what I wrote some days ago about how I feel about the issue:

How is it price fixing?


Only ones refusing to raise the capasity are the ones refusing Segwit and LN.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:28:53


It wasn't. They agreed to increase it if it reached consensus. It never did.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:01:57


Well that's the problem. It can be too easy  to fake that blocks are full and pressure for one increase after another using social engineering and spamming the blockchain. We should never go down that road. We should make optimizations and implement smarter ways to scale on chain (MAST, Schnorr, etc.) and off chain (LN, sidechains, etc.). And study if we need to increase the limit and how much after we have enough knowledge.
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:34:50
Yes and many people would have preferred SegWit without the increase. But I think it was a good compromise.
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:56:01


No, I'm not telling that. I believe that most of those companies have good intentions. The NYA agreement might have appeared good initially. Segwit2x however is reckless and it should not be followed. I'm also not saying all hard fork proposals are attacks at Bitcoin. You just read my post ant interpreted it totally wrong and I believe you did that on purpose.
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:19:16
It's more like metric of success.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:10:10


Most likely not much different than it's now. But we have to see what happens when SegWit is up and running.
@_date: 2016-12-21 13:47:10
Repeatedly saying that doesn't make it true.
To me it's more scaling solution than just increasing the block size limit. Later just increases throughput while SegWit does that and in addition makes changes that allow more advanced scaling.
@_date: 2016-11-19 06:50:20
populistic much
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:46:53
Or majority of the users that just don't want to see block size **limit** increase yet. x2 failed just because users didn't want it.
@_date: 2016-12-14 11:10:18
That's not really what Satoshi meant. You should read the whitepaper in the context of the audience it was originally meant for.
And when has Bitcoin been fluent way for paying coffee? 
It really won't be until LN or similar is deployed. Increasing block size limit to 2Mb 4Mb or even 20Mb will not do it. People should start accepting that Bitcoin has technical limitations that are not easy to overtake.
And increasing it requires a HF wich may look simple, but reguires consensus of all parties, and everyone must update. It could end up in chaos if not done right.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:12:59
Even if 100% hash rate supports it, it still is contentious.
Users will be fucked if they don't update and 3 months is far to soon. 
I just replied [this]( to another post here. Disaster I say!

Which makes the fork even more dangerous.

And If I remember correctly, there was no code for NYA at that time. I believe that now that we have seen how the implementation looks like (no replay protection etc.) the proposal is even more controversial than at the time of that survey.

It has been close to zero few occasions though. Are you sure it wasn't then?
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:22:19


It might in fact be the opposite. It is alot more difficult to get consensus required for forks when there are alot of users. In my opinion bitcoin grew too popular too soon. There are so many people now in bitcoin world that are lacking technical understanding and who can be drawn by populistic comments like "We need bigger blocks to have more users -&gt; increased value!" 
The protocol should be developed cautiously before mass adoption happens. That's why I wouldn't rush with LN If it really makes almost instant and cheap transactions possible.
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:15:06
"there doesn't seem to be anything here"
@_date: 2019-08-30 16:06:10

If you study the matter further you'll notice it's not that simple fix.
@_date: 2016-11-30 08:16:44


No. Status quo means we are closer to true immutability which is believed to be the most important property of bitcoin.
SegWit is a compromise and I'd like to see it happen. If it doesn't it's fine as well.
@_date: 2016-11-18 06:13:35
That post is filled with ignorance. I hope other miners have more knowledge.
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:29:26
Blocks being full or empty doesn't matter if you want instant transactions. One block takes ~10 min to find and can sometimes take more than an hour to find. And thats just one confirmation.
Instant transactions might be possible with LN.

I can understand support for 2Mb block size limit, but I can't understand support for S2X. It would be easier if they provided strong 2-way replay protection. Without it I can't think how it could be anything than a hostile takeover attempt.
The announcement written by Brazilian and Argentinian communities includes pretty much all reasons why 2x should not be supported. You can read it [here]( The whole thing is very good, but this is what I think is very important part:

I don't know when the vulnerability was found. My initial assumption was that it was just found recently and the versions without the vulnerability have been around for a while already. And it's possible that most people have already upgraded. 
In open source we always have to either go trough the code ourselves or just trust that others have done it and tested enough so that there are no vulnerabilities.

We have had one block size increase after march already. Now everyone just needs to upgrade. I see no reason to HF untill we have clear plan what to include in it and how much the blck size limit should be increased if at all. Look up spoonnet if you are not yet familiar with it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:51:10
Bitcoin is not complete yet. It will scale on multiple layers. Alot of good things are about to happen. Increasing the safetylimit however is not scaling. It increases the thoughput yes, but we souldn't do silly thing like that just because fees are temporarily a bit high.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:48:59
You paid too high fee. You can't blame the protocol for it. Blame the wallet software.
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:28:48


It's as urgently needed as it was 2 years ago. We do need scaling and increasing the throughput but increasing the safety limit is bad way to do it. There have been and there will be on-chain and off-chain scaling. Maybe even an increase to the block size limit. It just takes time.
And even if we urgently needed the increase as you say, S2X  should still be opposed for the reasons explained in the link I gave in my previous message.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:26:49


Not really. People are free to use any client they want and Core itself is not centralized.

@_date: 2017-11-11 08:39:05
Mining and development are already much more centralized in BCH. The worst part is their scaling plan focusing on L1 and they have advocated that nodes should be run in datacenters. It really is just paypal2 but not just as good. It lacks the qualities that make paypal worth anything and it lacks all the qualities that make Bitcoin have any value (decentralized, sencorship resistant, ungovernable).
It's not good long term IMO, but time will tell. I think we will see it crashin early next year and within 2 years it will be obvious to everyone it has failed.

spam limit = safety limit
There isn't enough adoption to use it in many places yet. As there isn't enough adoption for bitcoin on-chain yet either. I have made few purchases, VPN, stickers a mug etc. In fact I have used LN more times than I have used on-chain Bitcoin during past year.
The point of my post is that, there shouldn't be much use for settling purchases on-chain in the future. I have been reading about the history of money and Bitcoin is very much like gold. Gold had second layer (cash, checks) as well.

Opening a channel requires on-chain transaction. However that will be unnecessary at some point. They can just download an app and start transacting without needing to know what's under the hood. Just like bitcoin has been for a while. Most users aren't running own nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:10:53
I kind of like Wang Chun. I think he is just saying tihings to see how community responds and how it affects the prize (trolling). I think miners will eventually agree to segwit. They just want to have higher fees as long as possible. Maybe I'm a bit optimistic here, enjoying my holiday and taking few beers. I think I'll buy some bitcoin! :)

I don't think it is. Also I don't think bitcoins value comes from being able to handle a lot of low fee transactions.


This is a big problem. I do run a node on low cost machine with 100M internet connection. Still the initial process of syncing the chain was painful. I couldn't even do it on the same machine I'm running the node on. I had to download and validate the chain on different computer first.
I know that most people don't have to run a node but I understand the importance of it and I think everyone (at least most people) should be able to do it if they wanted.
@_date: 2017-04-17 00:48:21


Nope. Not at the moment atleast. And I'm sure we can have moret than 4x current capasity without hard forking.
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:57:08
You really believe so? For me it's pretty obvious that many of them are altcoin pumpers and sockpuppets. I can't be sure, but I don't think that's reliable way to measure segwit resistance.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:40:27
It makes the block size too high.
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:10:37
@_date: 2019-04-26 05:32:47


I disagree about the block size increase. But there should be discussion about implementing schnorr signatures and MAST which are means of scaling on chain that can be done using soft fork.


The thing is, 1MB was way too high in 2009 and the development of technology hasn't been enough. Initial sync is still as painful as it was in 2012 or 2013 when I tried using bitcoin the first time. Perhaps even more painful because the chain has bloated so much.


I know that sucks but that will most likely happen again. I don't think bitcoin will eventually be used for casual transactions.  It will be more like reserve currency and settlement layer like gold when most transactions happen off chain. We should preserve the properties of bitcoin that make it valuable and keep it decentralized.

But many have agreed to it. You give the impression that the community is black and white, but many who wanted a 2MB HF before are now in favour of segwit. Only small minority is still against it. And we should not let them decide. I would love us to have consensus, but I think 2MB+SW is too risky and even more controversial than SW alone. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 07:25:10
I run a node and I don't really care much about the on-chain fees.  I mostly use LN and I'm totally fine settling it on-chain once in ten years. That's more often than cash/checks were settled in gold in the beginning of 1900.
Increasing the safety limit is more risky than not doing it. I know we disagree.

I'm not arguing for bigger blocks as I agree with your opinion. However [this]( did happen.
Biggest cause might have been that the channel closure was initiated when my node was offline and the fees had risen when I got it back online.

This has never been the issue. Memory, bandwith and latency are the problems we face when the size of block chain increases. It's already 170Gb and growing rapidly. Hopefully 1MB+segwit(~2MB) isn't already too much. Even if higher block size limit could be fine, it would be stupid to take that risk. Community knows this. That's why the limit is what it is.

No they weren't. Payment channels (or unrecorded open transactions how Satoshi referred) were discussed from the beginning.

@_date: 2017-09-28 19:20:01


I have no such fear. I'm in the camp that thinks Bitcoin should avoid mass adoption until it's more developed (not talking about block size). And I don't believe that Bitcoins value comes from being able to perform a lot of fast transactions even though I believe it could be achieved through L2.


Maybe technologically but we wouldn't be having this discussion if they were simple to carry out in practice and if there was no possible negative repercussions. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:25:13


It can still be used as a store of value. And if it ever comes to that point where transactions take weeks, it should be easy to gain consensus for HF. I believe we will never have that situation.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:16:28
Ahh ok let me educate you a bit. First let me say that I love bitcoin.
Now you seem to imply that Miners are in control. However I know they are not (thank good).  Developers have some influence, but no direct control. Miners have some control over some soft forks (at least the two previous ones)
Nodes and users have control when it comes to some softforks, but not others. For example, they could refuse to use a segwit softfork leaving the network pretty much the same even if miners voted for segwit, but they could not refuse to use a softfork that censored certain transactions.
When it comes to hardforks the control lies entirely in the hands of users. Miners could hardfork Bitcoin, but without the users following them they would just be wasting money. In general, the miners are incentivized to follow the most valuable fork, and that is the fork that people are using.
All in all, Bitcoin decentralization is not perfect, but it's very good. And I love it for that!

No they don't. Only small portion of companies have agreed to 2x and some of them have withdrawn after it has come up that the implementation is dangerous. Not even all miners are aboard anymore. More will withdraw.
And when you say investors, you can really only talk about yourself and few others, but for me it's pretty obvious that most don't want 2x. It would make no sense to want 2x at this point. If everyone forgot x2 now, the value of Bitcoin would shoot to the moon because there was no longer the fear of hard fork and fear of losing money.


You are right I can't speak for majority. But neither can you when you say "companies, miners and investors want 2x" There is enough information available for me to be pretty certain that most users don't want 2x and that it will be a fuckup if it happens.
Only very small portion of the community has indicated that they want x2 and some have already withdrawn.

You can't have nearly instant low fee transactions on-chain no matter what the block size limit is unless you trust 0-conf which you shouldn't. It takes ~10min to find a block and it can take up to an hour which is fine for most use cases today but not really good for microtransactions. LN is very much needed regardless of how we scale on chain.

It comes from the actual value of Bitcoin as a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permission less deflationary currency.

The ones holding fiat instead are the ones losing value over to ones holding Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-06 05:40:23


They most definitely shouldn't.
 
There is not enough information available yet to evaluate how big the block size should be and if the increase is even needed.There are also other things that need to be studied as well such as what other improvements should be included in the HF. 
We should see other (the better) scaling methods (schnorr, MAST, LN etc) in action before we make any future plans for hard fork.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:39:07


It all depends how they are proposed and organized. I'm sure consensus is possible when there is an actual need for block size limit increase.


Of course it can happen. I just don't see it happening any time soon as long as Bitcoin is strong against these HF attempts. There are, and will be, other coins for other purposes but I don't know of another coin with Bitcoins properties that could replace it. Bitcoin is not a product, it's a protocol and it's not widely used yet and I hope it stays that way until it's ready.
I just read [this]( and it much sums up my feelings about 2x very well.

Indeed! Although that list was short to begin with. I mean there were really not that many companies signing NYA in the first place. Majority of miners but only minority of businesses. I don't think I have even used any services of the ones that signed. Bitpay maybe.
Kraken, Bitstamp, Trezor, Mycelium and few others I use never agreed to anything. If it werent for the miners, we wouldn't even talk about S2X anymore. I'm pretty sure Bitfury and BTCC will withdraw at some point and others will follow.

@_date: 2017-10-18 09:23:47


It won't happen. What other coin is more ready for mass adoption than Bitcoin? We can have the increase when/if it's actually needed. Consensus should be easy to reach then. And Segwit is not the only solution. Shnorr and MAST are on their way. 
I myself am not too strongly agains 2MB increase, but I don't like the way 2x is organized and implemented. My biggest objection for 2MB bump is that we don't have enough information to know if it's enough or too much. It can't be too big because centralization and too small bump is pretty pointless. I'd like to see better solution for Block size than just doubling the number and I'd like to see proper research being done.

We should never go down that road. That gives hope for the Bitcoin opponents in attacking bitcoin through social engineering.

Core did have a plan and now we have increased the limit. (Segwit)


Big part of community and experts still feel we should not have additional increase to the safety limit. There just is no consensus. Why even try building one if you think it's bad for Bitcoin? And most of those experts do think we might need to increase it at some point, but why not try other scaling methods first, analyze the situation and then make a proposal for limit increase when we know how much it should be increased and what other improvements should be included in the hard fork. 
This hasty 2x would be the end of Bitcoin if it succeeds because it just proves that Bitcoin doesn't work the way it's supposed to.

That is just the simple explanation he gave when trying to sell his idea. We both know (hopefully) that datacenters are a bad idea and would make Bitcoin too easily governable. Did you completelly ignore the message Satoshi had sent Hearn and the post by Hal Finney?


That's not true. There is alot of on-chain scaling being done (Segwit, MAST, schnorr). And HF is being planned as well (spoonnet). 


It's not artificial restriction, it's a safetylimit put on it's place by Satoshi for very good reasons.

Most big mining pools are signaling for 2x and they signed the NYA. Some of the mining pools have dropped already and some miners are [moving to other pools such as Slush and F2Pool that are not signaling for 2x.](


Because they will lose money mining 2x. It's value is so much less than 1x. The future value is of course just speculation based on trading futures and how I see community supporting the original BTC.

@_date: 2019-09-09 18:07:40
Majority of users were very much in favor of segwit and against block size increase. Some big mining pool operators wanted the block size increase. There was a closed doors agreement with some few big players and mining pool operators to do x2 and they had majority hash rate briefly on their side. It had no support from developers and rest of the community however.
x2 advocates chickened out eventually when they realized that the users were against it. A lot of things were happening at the time such as UASF etc. so my explanation is simplification of the events.  You are wrong however. Most people didn't want block size increase then and most people still  don't. Maybe at some point in the future when other scaling possibilities and optimizations have been exhausted and when we have more complete list of other features we should include in the possible hard fork.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:04:56


Except that the blockchain grows rapidly even if the limit isn't increased. 


Higher capacity doesn't mean increased adoption.
Even if that was true I don't think bitcoin is mature enough for mass  adoption yet. Attacking Bitcoin through social engineering will get easier when the community begins to consist more of people without much technical knowledge. Therefore it should be strong enough to withstand these attacks when the time comes. We need as many nodes as possible spread all over the world.
I do agree that there might be need for block size limit increase at some point in the future. Not now however.


Same people who are running nodes now.


I'm sure they will get enough in fees.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:04:06


And I have never seen any proof of block size increse being the original plan. The original plan according to posts by Satoshi and Hal Finney was sidechains and LN type of system. Of course on-chain scaling has always been and always will be considered. Even block size could be increased at some point.

Why do you think we need users now? Shouldn't bitcoin be a little more developed before that?

It does that and much more.

It's a glitch with fee-estimating algorhithm.
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:26:28


Populism much? If that were true, why not give us proof an calculations instead of just stating it's a fact (Which it isn't)?
I myself believe 1M with segwit is just fine for now. And nobody really knows the effect of Segwit+LN+schnorr+other improvements so why not do those first and then think about the more controversial solutions (HF) later?
@_date: 2016-10-07 14:39:57
Yes, and the volume has been high almost an year now. Alot higher than it was 2013. And I wouldn't be surprised if it increased alot more during next year.
So you really don't see any pattern here?
@_date: 2017-05-03 03:07:51


I am. Other current options I mean. I'm all for other good solutions, but I havent seen any good ones proposed.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:40:58
Never seems to happen there. There is another site "nodecounter" (Owned by Ver I think) where that happens.
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:34:56
Hopefully we never see a hardfork in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:05:23
All 3 are true.
@_date: 2016-10-11 10:01:09
That would have decreasing effect on the price, tho I don't think many actually care much about that announcement.
@_date: 2016-10-14 07:39:18
Hopefully we will soon have SegWith.
@_date: 2016-10-26 08:15:21


You should follow more closely then.

Not sure if that is up to date.
@_date: 2016-10-23 06:37:34
BU is unlikely. Community doesn't want it.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:18:42


Many will try.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:00:57


How do you know this?
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:04:49
No it's not. Compromise is the enemy of immutability. 
I could agree to segwit softfork, but HF? No way!
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:19:00


Segwit + 2Mb is much more controversial than segwit alone. It won't get consensus. Right now most of the community wants segwit first and HF when/if needed later.
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:36:06


Wrong! More recent calculations show it to be closer to 1.9MB
Best solution we have.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:47:26


Hopefully they don't. If that happens I'll sell my bitcoin. Might buy some back after the crash caused by HF.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:54:06


It's difficult for me to understand how anyone could think that avoiding HF is bad?
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:03:03
This is what he wrote 5 months ago explaining why:
The discussion that lead to that response: 
@_date: 2016-10-03 07:13:28


People want what's on cores roadmap. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:18:32
Not as complicated as Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:46:45


Deadlock is better than the agreement.
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:34:15


There is still alot to be done before it's ready for mass adoption. 2MB blocks won't change that.
@_date: 2016-10-12 05:29:23
[Google translation.](
It's like it's written by Ver himself. Don't understand why they believe his reasoning.
@_date: 2016-10-07 14:54:01
Ok, so you just didn't read what responded. He was agreeing about volume growing in zero-fee exchanges, while falling on others. And your chart agreed with that. That's what got me confused. 
I do agree that chinece exchange volume information can easily be manipulated. I still wouldn't totally ignore it.
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:26:13


He shouldn't. Nobody really wants BU. Miners are just trying to delay the block size limit increase (Segwit) as long as they can.
@_date: 2017-05-03 03:24:33


No! It gives big miners power to push small miners out of business. It increases centralization and is not good for bitcoin in the long term.


Yeah ofcourse. We should go towards mining decentralisation and not the other way.
Segwit is the best solution we have at the moment. And there is really no good arguments against it. If you know better, please educate me?
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:37:52
But you can't name even one.
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:52:47
HF your mother if you want HF
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:01:39




It's not in white paper. You do realize that white paper is just the beginning of it all.  Ofcourse it's amazing how far Satoshi had already thought about the system, but he couldn't have thought everything.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:30:15


I disagree. Most experts seem to think that HF should never happen. And some of them think block size shouldn't be increased. Segwit is a compromise.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:34:37
There are however strong arguments against increasing block size too much and strong arguments against hard fork. It's not about not willing to compromise. It's about not willing to shit on Bitcoin.
After studying the matter enough, SegWit -&gt; Schnorr&amp;LN etc. route should be no brainer. And many people (maybe most users?) feel this way. That's why it's impossible to get consensus for something that includes a HF at this time. It might be possible later when it's actually urgently needed and there are no better solutions presented, and when there is a well thought plan for it's execution. But I wouldn't be surprised if we never see a hard fork in Bitcoin. And it doesn't really worry me at all. More the opposite.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:58:10
Not going to happen!
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:51:04


In a way. But bitcoin is not bitcoin if it's not decentralized. Bitcoin as sencorship free digital gold is much more valuable than low fee "digital cash" (which is also possible through LN). We can't have both with just onchain scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:58:34
Amen to that!
@_date: 2016-10-07 16:34:16
I agree that market cap being at ATH this summer is not a big deal altho it's nice and positive observation. I was only disagreeing with you about volume falling.
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:25:35
I think that website counts all nodes (listening and non-listening).
Most sites only count listening nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-06 07:38:19


Solutions have been presented and implemented. Now we need miner consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:47:17


Block size was not originally intended to be increased. Satoshi said it can be done, but never wanted to hardfork because the hassle it causes.
And The centralisation risk is real. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:09:07
I think core is fine with status quo.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:30:47
Ahh yes the Hearn quoted satoshis old message 2013
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:08:45


It's not completelly broken, but I can see there is a problem that should be fixed. Maybe UASF?


No. Miners are only part of the bitcoin economy. Bitcoin fails if we let miners alone dictate what gets implemented and what doesn't.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:15:50


Indeed and community showed their force using UASF to pressure miners. Now we'll get segwit and hopefully we can avoid chainsplit.
I'm not afraid of BCC or any other altcoin. I have even invested some in monero/ether/litecoin (I'm not going to touch BCC any more than sell those immediately if I somehow get some for free). I truly believe that 90% of the community does not want to see a HF to bigger block size any time soon because I believe most have gained enough knowledge of the protocol to know it's not good for Bitcoin in the long term. Atleast not until we have seen other optimizations and innovations in action.

That's not what he means.
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:47:06


Blocks have been full ofcourse. That's not a bad thing.


Bitcoin has been working 100% without any downtime. Fees have been a bit high at some point, yes. And transactions with smaller fees have not gone through as fast as sometimes assumed. That's bitcoin. Bitcoin can be made better through on- and offchain scaling, but we must not risk decentralization. There are better ways than increasing the block size. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:50:36
Why are you willing to risk the whole ecosystem for nothing (hasty hard fork which gives nothing but increases safetylimit and excludes big bunch of experts from developing it)?
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:07:33
The opposite is true. He in fact didn't want to hard fork because all the hassle it causes.

@_date: 2017-07-25 07:54:28
Core developers follow the Satoshis original plan of decentralized money. It's not centrally planned like the other option is. I don't really know what you are trying to say here. Either you just don't understand Bitcoin or you have some weird agenda for pushing this scam.
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:00:00


@_date: 2017-07-21 12:10:05
Your math is wrong in pretty much every way it can be.
* Blockchain grows all the time even with 1MB limit
* Segwit + 2Mb means that the limit is something between ~4 and 8
* The chain size doesn't double the moment the limit is increased. That only means that bigger blocks are accepted and blockchain can grow faster than before.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:32:59


That's what they may be saying. In reality though Core roadmap is in line with satoshis original plan. Satoshi even described conceptual lightning network in his [message]( to Mike Hearn in 2013.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:45:55
Well it's useless to speculate. We'll see what will happen soon. Hopefully we can avoid the split.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:36:11
Probably not many people at your funeral when you die.
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:29:37

@_date: 2017-07-31 13:50:38
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:25:21
He only implies that it's good that Exchanges support BMC so that people can dump it. I really don't understand how you read it.
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:13:42


Hardly. Atleast if it means increasing the safety limit.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:23:59
Even if they were it doesn't matter. You can see from the actions and code who is real cyberpunk and who is corporate bullshitter. Obviously those who value security above adoption are the true cyberpunks. Yes, we need scaling but there is no urgency for big blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:57:29
Fortunatelly trust is not required. Only some basic understanding of how the poll works.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:19:52


The solution has been ready for a while now. The technical community really thought SegWit was a no brainer to all and that it would be adopted fast. That was the only mistake. But saying there is no solution is lying.


On-chain stransactions aren't supposed to be free! We need backlog in the long term anyway. L2 is for small, nearly instant and low-fee transactions.


Care to clarify?


Bitcoin won't fail if it never forks. Immutability FTW!
Only HF could weaken it. That is why I think the HF supporters are the malicious ones. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:27:13
I don't think any other pool than bitcoin.com is actually running BU.

The complains might be real. However many complains are directed towards bitcoin development team (Core) instead of miners where the complaints should be directed.

No it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:59:48
Blockstream was founded by few developers. If Satoshi was around and didn't want to be anonymous he'd most propably be one one of the founders.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:22:08
He can't.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:21:06
Not perfect but something.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:51:28


Whitepaper describes the consept. Alot of development happened after that even when Satoshi was around. I just replied to another post of yours about a message from Satoshi to Mike Hearn where he describes basically a conseptual LN without the routing.
Segwit makes it possible to scale without centralizing the blockchain and pushing small transactions outside. You can still transact on-chain ofcourse, but all coffeebuys don't need to be there.
If we keep bloating the chain by mindlessly inreasing the safetylimit (put in its place by Satoshi himself) we risk the whole ecosystem. If users can no longer run nodes on normal computers over tor, Bitcoin becomes governable. The most important thing is to avoid that.
@_date: 2017-05-03 03:04:36


So are most of us here. Core roadmap ftw!
@_date: 2017-05-03 03:28:47
Lets call it discussion then. From what I have studied  Extension blocks are a true risk for bitcoin and Segwit is the best solution we have. If you think you know better, please provide some actual data.
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:30:37
Ofcourse it's not 100% accurate.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:11:08
Miners can't force HF the way they can force SF. Nodes can simply reject the blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:39:03
The most important thing is to keep Bitcoin ungovernable (decentralized). Bitcoin is about freedom and users being in controll of their own money without needing to trust any third party. I happily welcome scaling (on-chain and off-chain), but saying that increasing the safetylimit is necessary is just wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-07 05:31:32


No it hasn't.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:10:32
We should do everything to stop 2x. Although most likely he will not follow through.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:04:39


Users signed shit. Just miners and bunch of businesses. That's not what consensus means. That's not a compromise. Its a closed door deal. Here you can see what community thinks:
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:42:55


Why not just signal BIP141 then? They've had enough time to do it even before BIP148 was introduced.
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:28:47


Indeed, they want UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:15:33
Then everyone would think they have gone mad. 4MB with SW is far too high.
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:49:14


I don't think there is any competition that really matters. If you think so, then I think you don't really understand what Bitcoin is about. I have invested some money into Bitcoin, but for me it's not about money. It's about freedom, and being in controll of my investment without needing to trust any third party.
I also think Bitcoin should stay small until it's strong enough to endure attacks by governments and other entities that are against such freedom that Bitcoin enables. Most important thing for Bitcoin is to stay ungovernable and increasing block size risks that. Segwit is a compromize I'm willing to take. Segwit enables many other optimizations for on-chain scaling as it enables off-chain scaling. 
After we have seen those in action, we should evaluate the situation again and see if there is consensus for bigger block size limit. Now there isn't and there is no need for it. Not for Bitcoin. We can use creditcard/paypal/whatever for our coffee, and maybe later some application that is enabled by L2 innovations. There really is no urgency to increase the safetylimit.
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:13:32


It's the opposite. Very simple solution for a complex problem.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:47:32


Everyone will not be on the lightning network. Even rejecting non-segwit nodes does not mean that.


That's the beauty of it and also propably the the reason people like Mike Hearn and Gavin was in such a haste to prevent it by bringing the fight to the public soon after LN white paper was released. With LN, Bitcoin could remain inflation free, secure, and scalable without risking becoming governable. Hearn wanted blacklists and rid of Tor, he wanted all transactions on chain just like you, and LN is a threat to that. He wanted to prevent transactions from going dark and proposed increasing the limit to some high number so in the future ordinary users couldn't even stop a fork because they couldn't even run a node.
And of course Bitcoin will still be transparent public ledger. Just not all transactions have to be included.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:19:58
hmm am I witnessing some strange cultural/language thing where people understand statements so differently. I don't know luke-jr so I can't be sure what he ment but I really don't think that he was implying that exchanges aren't supporting BCH/BMC/whatever-coin. He must very well know that there is support. And I for one am glad there is so I can send my BMC/BCH to an exchange and get rid of em.

@_date: 2019-05-31 11:54:16


In the future, all this happens under the hood. There already exists custodial solutions but I believe we can get close to that non-custodially at some point.
Not many internet users know about the underlying protocols, but almost everyone knows how to send e-mail or search google.


Not as flawed as solutions to increase block size.
@_date: 2016-07-17 11:34:29
That's not what I meant. I mean the whole discussion about r/btc moderation and settings taking place mostly in the other sub. Roger Ver has already made changes and that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

@_date: 2017-06-11 04:25:04
They aren't nessecary. Block size limit however is!
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:01:23
:D Good luck!
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:13:12


I believe that as well. But you can't blame core devs for what some miners are doing.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:02:43


What do you mean? Bitcoin is just about now starting to need more on-chain throughput. 3 years ago we needed feemarket. If segwit activates this year, it's great! If later, the blame is on miners.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:22:16
All cryptos will face same problems. They either have a limit or they are centralized. So far nobody has come up with better solution than going for L2 and scaling off chain.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:31:59


You shouldn't say it's the truth because you can't possibly know that.
Users didn't want HF then and they don't want HF now. What can you or miners or developers do about it?
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:25:32


I agree. We should not too eagerly wish for mainstream adoption. The protocol should fist be given time to develop. There is no rush. Digital gold first and digital cash later through L2 technologies.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:23:08


What? They have done everything the best they can. Better than anyone else could. Increasing block size is not in their hands. Community doesn't want it. Not yet until we have seen Segwit and LN in action and we have better means to measure how much block size limit should be increased (if at all) and what other things should be implemented in hard fork, and how we could get consensus for it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:38:43


Umm not really. Atleast not more complex than Bitcoin itself is.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:23:26




No, nothing will go to blockstream. How would that even happen?
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:24:00
It solves it better than 2MB increase to block size limit. And even if SegWit alone wouldn't do it, it enables additional scaling which definatelly will.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:42:01
Satoshi never wanted to HF. He just said it's possible.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:36:32
Exactly why I'm starting to lean towards UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:20:49


Atleast I'm not delusional about how open source development works. And I'm not delusional about how difficult and slow it is to make changes to running protocol with so many stakeholders. 


What other perspective are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:52:42
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:13:41
SW will get activated with the help of SW2x and UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:39:46
I have made maybe 15-20 transactions during past few months and the fees have been between 0.3$ and 1.7$. I have no problem with the fees. I still would like to see LN and more use cases even though small transactions aren't my primary use for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:44:14
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:29:15
Weihting in coin.dance doesn't work correctly. It seems to give far too much weight to bitcoin.com and miners controlled by Jihan. Don't use it.
@_date: 2016-07-17 11:28:03
I don't post much, but it's still frustrating :/
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:20:04


Bitcoin didn't need increase in on-chain throughput back then. Back then we needed fee-market. Bitcoin is starting to need on-chain scaling now and Segwit has been around for a while now waiting for activation.


It's open source! Everyone can contribute and users choose what code they want to use. There really haven't been many usefull suggestions for increasing throughput. 
So far the best route presented is Segwit -&gt; shnorr -&gt; LN/MAST etc.
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:58:08


It just means that everyone who really understands bitcoin agrees that scaling must be done carefully.


Satoshi spoke the opposite.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:34:41
What did you do to fix the issue? You come here blaming others when you yourself have done shit. Where is your solution?
And core developers actually did fix it. They came up with the most awesome fix. It took some time for the community to reach consensus. By now only few miners are against it (which is something devs didn't foresee).
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:53:49
They've been signaling for Segwit for a while now.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:10:04


Actually I haven't been in favour of BIP 148 (Unless there appears to be significant support that can be measured in reliable way). So no.


Not really. I'd just like to know on what basis the weighing happens before I trust it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:21:42
Umm what are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:43:03
I don't think he's running BU. Just signaling. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:59:06
Why would we if we don't need it?
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:43:33


Except it's not artificial. It's there for very good reasons.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:53:28
I'm not but maybe I could live with it if it reaches consensus.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:16:14
The update however would be alot easier thanks to backwards compatibility of soft forks. What does the complexicity even matter if it's well tested and thoroughly peer reviewed?
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:25:47
Because there are safer and better options.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:34:08
Segwit is a real fix. At least it makes some real fixes possible. 
Increasing the block size limit to 2Mb is only temporary band aid and requires a risky hard fork. And much higher block size limit puts Bitcoins most valuable properties at risk.
Segwit -&gt; Shnorr -&gt; LN route is the best route. It gives real scaling and it's safe. We can plan HF later when we have better means to measure how much block size limit should be increased (if at all) and what other things should be implemented in hard fork, and how we could get consensus for it.
When you say that increasing the limit is easy fix, you really can't be serious. It reguires consensus and past years have shown very clearly how difficult it is.

He is too scared that satoshidundee tries to do the same with BCH if he does that.

Blockchain size has increased over hundredfold from 2010 even with 1MB blocksize limit. 
And even if disk space wasn't a problem, badwith is!
If we want to be conservative, even 1MB is too much.
That is why SegWit really is a compromise.

If you say Segwit is only theoretical fix you can say same about the hard forking to higher block size limit. Both will increase the throughput, but neither has been implemented on Bitcoin in practice.

It already kind of is. Trump is in his pocket.

Bitcoin is not a product.

That never happened. Their direction has been spot on all the time.

What? Hasn't this been explained million times already?

He couldn't just signal BIP141?

How is increasing the limit anything more than duct tape when the whole situation could be fixed with L2 solutions? We should atleast give real scaling a chance before doing something risky as hardforking to bigger limit.

It can be very detrimental to the future of Bitcoin. And totally unnecessary when we can scale on-chain using safer means (Segwit+schnorr+other optimizations). So why not play it safe? It's the future of money we are talking about here so every step should be carefully considered. If the activation time was 12-18 months instead of 3 months it would be easier to swallow, but I would still prefer if we considered it only after we have seen these other improvements in action.

"Core principles" what Maxwell and other core developers today are talking about aling very well with what Satoshi has written.
The post you linked is in no way relevant. You can't really make any valid assumptions from it. He just gives his idea of how the block size limit should be incresed if that was ever needed. He has also made posts saying he doesn't want to hard for because of the hassle.
Mike Hearn also tried to present his thoughts as they were Satoshis when in 2009 he presented an email that was(allegedly) from Satoshi, where he claimed Bitcoin [could scale beyond Visa levels.](
He just conveniently left out the explanation Satoshi gave him, which was pretty much a conceptual Lightning Network using payment channels.
