We are talking about people that don't even know about bitcoin here, they won't read or understand that fine print.

Segwit has an example of that: the root hash of the witness block gets imbedded in the scriptPubKey of the coinbase transaction. This works fine, but it has some drawbacks.  
1. You have to do special processing on the coinbase tx to see if the block has segwit data. This adds complexity, and complexity is bad  
2. Space in the scriptPubKey is limited, so you can't keep adding stuff in there
A simpler/more straight forward solution would be to add an extra field to the block to hold the root hash of the witness block.

A blockchain at it's core is just a database where every entry is cryptographically linked to the previous. That means you can't change an entry retroactively without changing the whole chain.  
The biggest difference between blockchain implementations is the way you generate a new valid block. You need to make sure no one can just change the whole blockchain, you need some kind of gating.  
Bitcoin uses Proof of Work, you need to proof that you burned an amount of resources before you can amend the blockchain. This makes it so that retroactively changing the blockchain becomes really expensive. This is really important for Bitcoin because it means Bitcoin can be trustless. Trust and anonymity don't mix well, so for Bitcoin to be anonymous this is a must.  
However this has a really significant drawback: Generating blocks is slow as a snail (compared to most IT things), which severely limits the transaction throughput. And even worse, because of difficulty adjustments and limited blocksize you can't just throw more computing power at it. There will only be a block every ~10min, regardless how big your mining farms get.  
*This is the price you pay for a trustless blockchain.*  
 Blockchain
Now here is where private blockchains come in. Because there are private and not anonymous they don't need to be trustless. If someone fucks with the blockchain you can take them to court.  
This means you can replace the slow and inefficient Proof Of Work with something faster and less resource intensive. The simplest form would be just giving every participant a private key with which they sign their new blocks. This in turn means you can have much faster block times, you could have a block every minute or every second or 100 blocks per second. Your transaction throughput can easily be massive, and you only need to spent a fraction of the energy bitcoin mining uses.  
Private blockchains and Bitcoin have different properties and uses.  
Private chains are faster (more tp/s) and "waste" less energy, but they aren't trustless or anonymous.  
If you want **(semi)anonymous, censorship resistant, decentralized transactions, Bitcoin** is the way to go.  
But for something like a (inter)national currency a private chain (as in, mining is only allowed for invited parties, transactions can be made by anyone) is better suited.

You seem to think the community has any sort of real power over the direction for bitcoin.  
There are 3 groups who have power over the protocol.   
Programmers make the rules through the bitcoin software.   
Miners enforce the rules through chosing which software to run.   
Exchanges decide which set of rules has value because it can be exchanged for real money.   
These three groups need to come to an agreement. Users will either follow or be left with an unusable coin.

Well that is just BS. 


Every program has bugs, that's no reason to not have real spec for the protocol. But instead bitcoin devs seem content that there is undefined/unknown behavior in their protocol.


Isn't that what core is doing? Everytime some other implementation doesn't produce the same results as core the core dev team can just say "we are the protocol, deal with it".
The reason not having a real spec is that it makes developing a competing client to core really difficult and frustrating.  
If you wanted to, for example, make another TCP implementation everything is, in complete detail, available in the RFC. If you wanted to make another bitcoin implementation you practically have to look what core is doing, because the spec might not be right. And if core introduces a change in an update unintentionally it's not them who has a problem, it's you. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 08:02:22
Who said a currency needs to be of high value? The Yen is doing just fine and it's value is pretty low
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:37:50
But core can never have bugs, because core defines the protocol. So everything core does is, by definition, in accordance with the protocol.  
Every "bug" in core is therefore nothing more than a quirk in the bitcoin protocol. And every other client has to replicate cores logic ~~bug~~ quirk for ~~bug~~ quirk.  
Of course you could publish an "official" protocol spec and expect everyone to adhere to it. But that means there could be bugs in core, and that would just be terrible!

* Slow as molasses (currently 3tps)

Sure if you vote the same as the majority your vote is practically insignificant. However if you don't vote yourself you are trusting other people to vote the way you want to vote.  
You can draw an analogy to bitcoin mining. Every miner (voter) for themselves does not a lot to secure the network, it would still function with only one miner. So should most miners just say "I trust the other miners to enforce the rules *I* want, so I will stop mining"?

@_date: 2015-08-25 10:34:16
The sensible thing would probably be to create the consensus library while simultaneously working on an actual formal protocol spec.  
Of course for that to work you have to convince the core devs that their implementation has to conform to the protocol and not the other way around as is currently the case.

Which is about none, compared to merchants accepting visa.


Let's compare the user experience:  
Download and sign up for an app with your credit/debit card (which 99% of the people driving cars have). Then use that to pay, money comes straight from your bank or credit card account.  
Or:  
Figure out how to use bitcoin, including buying them, sending them to you wallet, finding a good wallet, dealing with price fluctuations, etc. Also, if you fuck up: SFYL.  
From a merchants perspective:  
Figure out how to setup and use a bitcoin payment system, keep your coins secure, converting btc to usd to pay your bills and all the other usual hassle of using bitcoin.  
Or:  
Use visas network, which you probably have already setup because visa is accepted practically anywhere.  


What was that about convoluted payment systems?  
Also, wallets need updating, you need to top them of (really inconvenient in front of the parking lot with cars waiting behind you, but it will take 10 minutes anyway)

Ex.:  
Currently  user -&gt; node -&gt; node -&gt; node -&gt; miner is not much different than user -&gt; miner. With tips each node would take a chunk and the first example would be more expensive for no real benefit

It's all about trust, or the lack there of.   
In a decentralised, anonymous network trusting anyone would be a bad idea, so you need some way to make sure everyone plays by the rules. That is what proof-of-work/mining accomplishes.

The easiest way is to say they are one-way encryption, you turn an input into a big number. The output is always the same, but you can't get the input from the output, hence the "one-way"

That phrase is way older than bitcoin.  
If bitcoin dropping to zero (or you losing your btc) puts you in a difficult spot that means you invested to much.

Miners are in a hashpower arms race, since more hashpower means more money. So the hashrate keeps going up and miners need to grow to stay economically viable and go where electricity is cheapest. This will eventually result in a few large miners in very few geographical locations, since everyone else can't compete.

Pirate bay also has a lot of legal troubles anyway

That would be my guess as well, if the article didn't state 


Which to mean means they are planning to eventually move away from IP altogether.

It's not just miners, the criterium is power consumption over 250kWh/sq foot.

1. "requires" is the important word here  
2. Upvote bots are easy

Not for sending it around the world, but I have paypal / banks for that.  
And for day to day stuff cash is good enough.  
I'm not saying that bitcoin is bad, I just see no reason to use it over what is already well established and widely accepted

Cyclic complexity, average number of lines per function/file, amount of comments, density of swearwords, etc.  
A lot of people have thought about code complexity, how to measure it and how to reduce it.

A fork happens anytime there is a change to the rules.  
A softfork happens when rules are tightened. Old nodes see the new rules  as valid, but new nodes don't see the old rules as valid anymore.  
A hardfork happens when rules are relaxed or removed, old nodes would see the new rules as invalid and reject them. New nodes may or may not see the old rules as valid, depending on what was changed.  
As example: the current blocksize is limited to 1MB. If we change the limit to 500kb it would still be valid for old nodes that check for 1MB. But if we raise it to 2MB the old nodes will reject it.
If everyone agrees one the fork and updates their software nothing much happens, regardless if it's a hard- or softfork.  
The problem comes when people don't agree. If people are running software with different rules a chain split can happen where there are effectively two chains, one with the changes one without. Importantly this can also happen regardless of hard- or softfork.  
If there is a big majority to one side this normally resolves in a few hours. But if there is about equal hashpower on both sides the split can potentially be permanent. Or worse the split resolves only to split again, and again and again...  
Tl;dr: There are risks to forks, both hard and soft. But a well executed fork with overwhelming support isn't the end of the world.

That depends what exactly one means.  
Every additional node is an additional peer to download the blockchain from. So every increases the theoretical maximum bandwith *for downloading the blockchain*.  
But on the other hand, every node a transaction hops through before reaching a miner adds latency, which slows *transaction propagation*

The problem is that his slides are just walls of text. Slides are supposed to completent what you are saying, not be a complete list of all your points. Because the listener reads the slide and is then bored by you repeating what's already on the slide.  
Ideally you want 2-3 sentences max on your slide, illustrations are preferred. Don't spend to much time on one slide, 30seconds to a minute, again to prevent people getting bored and stop listening.

Less than 50% of miners are not signalling segwit, what other explanation do you have for that except "they don't want segwit"?
