Isn't a fork by definition an event where a chain splits into two chains? And isn't an altcoin by definition a coin with it's own genesis block? If there is consensus, then there will be no fork, because the chain will just continue with the modified rules at a certain point.

You could do logins via [digest access authentication]( then you don't handle cleartext passwords (only first communicating the password). But this is only a "cheap" replacement for https, because then you would do the following communication completely open.

I don't like the inflationary use of the word *cabal*.
@_date: 2014-02-05 10:40:12
Sorry, it is a common figure of speech in my language/country to attribute the use of a word or a phrase as inflationary when it is used so often as a hyperbole, that when a *real* use for it comes along you have no way of expressing it, because the word/phrase has lost it's meaning. See for example [here]( I assumed that this would be the case for english as well.

Yesterday it was directly on their front page. Now you can't find it anymore, not even in their news (the news section has something from janruary). Instead they bury it in a blog which is less prominently linked than almost any other content they have, including the forum, faq and press info.
EDIT: looks like bitcoin.de/de shows the info while bitcoin.de/en is silent about the withdrawal issue, etc. Also the blog is separate between English and German (different selection of entries), even though both are 100% German. They might not have removed anything at all, but just never shown anything about it on the english page.

I bought into bitcoin in november and from there bought some altcoins. Now I am out of the altcoins, but my trading back then allowed me to recover my investment +10% in fiat AND keep the bitcoins I initially bought at the same time.

I don't think that JeanneDOrc meant to disagree with you. Saying the professors taught that BTC was evil is a device of storytelling in BTC-circles like telling a story of an atheist professor who was embarrassed by the superior intellect of a christian student in religious circles.

He raises a valid point, though. The extra benefit of any device that uses a lot of electricity is that it produces heat.

Wow, that's crazy.
Well, I just looked up the rules for my country (Germany) and it appears the limit here is €15,000. For anything above that the seller has to get identification of the buyer, but it is still legal to take that amount of cash. Actually Germany was the country that pushed for having a €500 bill (because we had the DM 1000 bill, which was worth the same at the time)

Does this also mean I could open a channel without any money and then wait for incoming lightning transactions to spend later? If yes, how would opening this channel be recorded on the blockchain?

According to  I am in the 1% anyway...

@_date: 2017-08-09 19:12:43




I can't add more money to an existing payment channel, as far as I understand. Also, money I received via a lightning channel can't be used to pay, because only my original money can be spent.
Basically, if I only want to have a single payment channel per year, I need to have all the money I am going to spend in that year at the time I created the channel.
Or am I wrong and I can spend the money that I receive via an existing channel? Because none of the explanations I heard covered this use case.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:44:30
Aren't there caveats though? Maybe I have an incomplete understanding of the technology.
* I have to commit a fixed amount of money on a channel when I open it
* I have to commit to a duration that the channel will be open at the time I open it
* I can't spend money I received without opening a channel after I received the money
* Until the channel is closed, I can't use the unspent money from the channel any other way
* Opening and closing a channel each are a bitcoin transaction recorded on the blockchain, and they are bigger than normal transactions, which means in order to achieve a good scaling effect, I need to pack lots of lightning transactions in there, and that might be problematic if I don't have a lot of money laying around

I feel that he didn't quite get the point of the last question.
He said himself, that not more hashpower is needed to support a much bigger bitcoin economy than we have now. Now we all know that the majority of bitcoins have already been mined, which means the bigger the economy, the higher the price of bitcoin. If the growth of bitcoin continues to outpace the decline of mining reward (which seems likely from the currentbstandpoint), then it is absolutely inevitable that hashpower will increase, because it is the economical thing to do for a miner.
@_date: 2019-02-13 03:19:43
They explicitly mention that purchase of miners is part of the cost. As long as mining pays more than the running costs (mostly electricity), it makes sense to keep already purchased miners running.

Interesting video, and he certainly is right that average Greeks can't buy bitcoin because they have no money.
But man, (I as a German have to say) his ramblings about Germany make little to no sense. Of course any sovereign nation can default on its debts, including Greece. And just because the market wasn't willing to loan Greece any more money at a payable interest rate and the european taxpayer stepped in, doesn't mean that changed in any way. But defaulting can have consequences and those consequences might be that some people won't be so willing to step in anymore afterwards.
Greece made its decision, now it's strange to see it not follow through on that. It seems that Greece at the moment is willing to fulfill almost all the requests it rejected before the referendum, just to get more loans from outside the market. Why? I guess their leaders made the choice that this is still better for them than defaulting. Or is there anything going on behind the scenes that the news don't cover?

Bitcoin.de doesn't allow fiat deposit because you pay the seller directly. Only crypto is held on the exchange.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:48:20


Sure, but just pointed out that not every potential block size (more on point every potential layer 1 transaction cost) enables the smooth workability of layer 2. Can you just add a third layer to solve that?
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:47:51
Judging from the question, OP is looking for a legal solution. Of course you can always try to hide your assets and lie about them when asked, but I guess that is illegal.
Luckily as a German citizen I am in a better situation. Unless you got the crypto by mining, you can sell without paying capital gains taxes if you held it at least for a year.
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:53:48
Well, I am sure that if the CEO of coinbase refuses you the 'goodwill' of giving you your crypto, then you don't have to pay taxes on your gains, because there are no gains. But as long as you made actual gains, you will probably legally be required to pay taxes on them.

Are we comparing apples to apples? From my understanding, if you want to transact on the lightning network, you usually run a lightning node. But the same isn't true for bcash, or is it?
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:58:41
If people pay routing fees to the lightning nodes that relay the payments through the network, does that mean that I can make money just by opnening channels? Or is it likely that the on chain transactions needed to open those channels eat away most or all of those relay fees?

You have to tax mining income, no matter how long you hold it, though. Money made from crypto coin speculation is tax free as you say when holding for at least a year.

Easy? You still have to play catch up with the older, longer blockchain or convince the majority of miners that your particular shorter version of the blockchain benefits them enough, so that  they do the catching up for you.

I went in with a (what was then) small amount early in the Nov '13 runup out of FOMO. Have been a HODLer ever since, but only out of FOMO. From traditional investment I know that you didn't realize any gains until you sell. But with bitcoin the logic was from the beginning, either bitcoin takes over or it will become worthless. And if it takes over you don't need a huge amount if you get in early enough. At some point I sold a fraction to recover my investment +some percent to feel some gain, so now even if it gets nowhere (which seems more unlikely every year), I didn't lose anything.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:06:39
Yes, but if someone is in danger or distress, you have to help him, unless it puts yourself in danger as well. There are rights to be assisted when in need by those who have the capacity, as long as some proportionality is kept. The extent of that should be determined by the democratic process of forming law and courts of law. You don't live in a vacuum.

Bitcoin.de works differently: you don't deposit money on the exchange, instead you pay directly to the seller's bank account. So the bank has no way of knowing if a payment is being done for a purchase on bitcoin.de.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the high taxes in scandinavian countries are on income, not on wealth. As far as I know, the US is pretty big with taxes on wealth compared to most (all?) of Europe (see estate tax).
