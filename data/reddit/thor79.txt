As someone from Schaumburg who commutes daily to River North via Metra and CTA...thank you for thinking of us :)

OpenDNS is still screwed up too...had to set it in my Hosts file.

Actually you do control your data. It is all encrypted client side before it is ever sent to the server. Look up Steve Gibson's review of it. He recommends it because it enables you to practice TNO...Trust No One.

I'll take retiring on my 41st...that'd be ok with me
Damn youngins

Yeah I haven't started mine up since...well shortly after I got it (kickstarter backer). Very disappointed with Game Quality. No better than my phone or tablet (they gotta change that to make it big time).

Thanks for this. I included a link to this in an email to the president of a charity I'm trying to convince to accept bitcoin. 
I'm a web developer and used to do work for them (I still occasionally do). I'm hoping he'll be more receptive than the CAPS guys are (see this thread: 
edit: He's intrigued by the idea and reading up more on it (including the book).

Yup...this just provided a bit better entry point for the smart ones. (note: smart is relative. In this case anyone following the standard buy low-sell high system is considered "smart")

This. Though I have never actually registered on the site, if I did it would be using a unique password. NONE...I repeat NONE of my passwords are duplicates, and my average password length is 18 characters (would be higher but some sites don't allow them longer). There's no excuse these days to have duplicate or short passwords when these slick password managers are out there. I don't use 1Password (used to when I was on an iPhone), but it is a good one to use.
Use Two factor if you have it available to you. The days of simply having a password for a site you care about are quickly vanishing.

Ohhh...didn't think of this until now. I'm going to see if I can get The Hero Initiative (another comics industry charity) to accept BitCoin. I used to post updates (I am a web developer) on their website and still occasionally do work for them. I'm sure he'll (the president of the charity) be up for another way to get funding, especially if I walk him through setting it up. Any tips you guys can provide on convincing him or getting it setup for him would help greatly.
edit: initial email sent to the president.
 in case you were wondering.
edit 2: He's intrigued by the idea....reading up more on it.

Did 1/3 of the 3 day Secret Santa giving using Bitcoin and Gyft at work. Could have done it all with Bitcoin, but I had already bought days 1 &amp; 2 when I thought of it.
Don't really have the Bitcoins to do all my Christmas shopping in it though. Eh...it's a start. Also made several coworkers aware of Bitcoin and its use in the festivities as it was one of two direct clues I dropped to allow her to guess my identity.

Because they want to compete in the home gaming console space. Perhaps I was just being too optimistic.

Please tell me you're kidding. For the amount of electricity they consume...they are extremely inefficient at producing heat. I have three GPUs going full tilt 24/7 plus a small number of USB miners and they don't make a damn bit of difference on the temp in my apartment. Maybe if you had a professional level bitcoin mining operation...but not a home hobbyist setup.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:51:04
Doesn't mean that heat does didily squat for actually increasing the overall ambient room temp of the room that it is in.

Depends on if they had to login...most likely they had a logged in state on the site (since they visit often)...so no password would have been captured.

Tried my first time today. Only one of the questions was a nonsensical (the rest were easy answers)....and the only correct answer would have been 'none of the above'. They asked me to pick a date but none of the dates would have been correct as they were far too recent (within 3-4 years). The actual date would have been closer to 8-10 years ago depending on how they got their information.
edit: Verified on the second try. I double checked my address with an address I verified with Amazon. Only one of the questions was a little vague this time...and I answered none of the above....went through just fine.

It's actually better if you don't try to change it unless you can confirm you are on the correct server (see the PGP signed message below for the actual ip of the site). A MITM attack wouldn't compromise any passwords stored on the site if left alone. It only works if you attempt to login to the site while the site is compromised. The site is directed at the MITM server currently, which means if you attempt to login using that site, it will capture your password. That is also why the "remember me" cookie is a safe way to browse the site...as it doesn't do anything to pass your password to the server, it just remembers that you have a logged in state, and continues that state.
The recommendation of the OP in the title of this thread is actually the last thing people should be trying to do. Yes you should change your passwords, BUT ONLY ON OTHER SITES WHERE YOU USED THE SAME PASSWORD AS BITCOINTALK.ORG...NOT bitcoingtalk.org itself. example: You used the same password on mt. gox as you used on bitcointalk.org, you SHOULD change it on Mt. Gox immediately, as well as any other sites using the same login. Leave the bitcointalk.org site alone for right now unless you know you are going to the correct site. Verify this yourself, do not trust that your DNS server is fast. When I went to check my own dns, OpenDNS, which is usually quite speedy, it had not changed yet (and still hasn't changed as I write this).
