I've been trying to get away from Coinbase/GDAX for a while, but the zero fee trades, coupled with being able to deposit fiat to my account(s) makes trying to find/use anything else a deal breaker.
Gemini requiring a wire transfer to get set up is a barrier to entry.  Not to mention, Coinbase has an app, so i can help folks who don't have a computer science degree get up and running without too terribly much hand-holding.

I would suggest the problem (as OP appropriately stated) is the disappointment with society and how lazy folks have become.  In the past, information was more easily controlled.  Now we're faced with the opposite, where we're constantly dealing with information overload and it's quickly becoming a skill to discern "fake news" from the real thing.  You have to fact check EVERYTHING.
Unfortunately, it's the world we now live in.  Misinformation campaigns are highly effective.  Thanks for doing god's (Satoshi's?) work.  Hats off to you, sir.

Thanks for the pro-tip.  Held off most of 2017 from adding a proper, discrete GPU and finally ordered something.  Curious to learn more about various crypto -- i suffer no delusions, not expecting to get rich off mining, but eager to keep learning as much as i am able about the technology.

Any advice for a neophyte just about to embark on their first mining endeavor?  I've run Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum nodes on both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu Server), have a pretty basic 1080 Ti on the way and a beefier power supply.  Still researching stages, but was leaning towards Windows for ability to hopefully make more adjustments, more easily to the GPU.  If the project goes well i'd also be curious to see how well a Vega performs under similar scenarios, unless Green Team is so easy and profitable that i'd want to simply continue replicating / expanding the current formula.  Vertcoin and Zcash were a couple leading potential contenders, but i keep hearing about other options and i've sort of lost focus.
My power costs are pretty low at $.03 / kWh, figure it'd be a crime to not try and at least offset some of the costs of the GPU through mining and try to learn a thing or two in the process.  Thanks for any input and/or experiences you may be able to share.  Crypto has already totally changed our worlds, for the better.  I hope more and more people can become empowered through technology.  Super exciting stuff.

Wow.  Impressive.  I'm fairly new to the btc stratosphere, but super eager to learn.  In an effort to try and show support for Core i spun up a VM this evening to host my first full node.  Hoping to expedite my transition away from exchange services, perhaps this will jump start my process -- nothing liek trial by fire, eh?
Without attempting to hijack OPs thread, could anyone share some tips, or suggestions to help out the n00b?  I've devoured all the resources i can find, and i'm only ~20GB into the initial download process.  My infrastructure runs behind 100/20 fiber + 20/2 cable load balanced.  Should this eventually be moved to dedicated hardware?  I'm not even sure of the proper questions to be asking, but felt compelled to finally chime in somewhere, so here it is, verified at bitnodes.21: **/Satoshi:0.14.0/**
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:46:37
Thanks you kindly, sir!!
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:47:00
I gave my VM i think ~150GB on a little SSD.  It's been completely downloaded now, so i think i'll just let that run until i convert to actual hardware.  I've got this 128GB micro sd card i just pulled from my tablet... how has been your experience with the RPi3 running a full node?  Does it consume the bulk of the system resources, or could i still toy around with the device a bit along side the full node?  Thanks very much for your insight, sir.
Pleasantly surprised i've managed to remain at 100% uptime for the past couple days, despite the issues with command line / RPC errors.
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:54:51

I won't have time this weekend, but i still hope to make time to move it to an actual machine.  Doesn't appear to be overly demanding on cpu time.  What are the pros/cons to pruning down my node?  Guess i have more homework to do.  Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:17:24
Regardless of my lack of true understanding, your point is beyond valid. things have gotten nasty and that adds zero value anywhere.  I respect that people are passionate, but when greed begins to define, or at the very least, have a direct impact on policy decisions, that's harder to stand behind.  Thank you for insisting on keeping things classy.  I appreciate you schooling me a bit. I'm the first to admit I know nothing... that's why I'm here, to learn. Apologies if I added negativity to the fray.  I merely wanted to voice my opinion by hosting a full node.
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:20:26
Could I trouble you to elaborate on this a little bit more, or perhaps recommend some further reading? I obviously haven't managed to inform myself well enough. Curious what I'm missing. Thanks you kindly.
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:15:38
Sure, you know what they say about opinions, right?  It's fine that everyone has them... just as it's fine to mock folks for being foolish.  Just my $0.02 -- i know nothing.
No reason Bitcoin should be trashed because miners have gotten greedy and/or feel compelled to exert control, despite the potential outcome (i.e. decimating Bitcoin as we know it).

Although, i still haven't been able to make more time to figure out this issue with my bitcoin.conf or dive into the logs, as per your suggestion.  But it seems to be whirring along, despite my neglect.  I've fired up PuTTY a couple times to run top and only consumes liek 7-10% CPU power most times, guess i should scale back the number of cores i dedicated to it, i obviously have very little clue as to what i'm doing.
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:23:16

So something along the lines of the type service Bitpay provides?  I don't know that i would receive more than one or two payments in any given month, but i hope to continue using BTC more and more.  It's been a wild month long ride.  The technology is simply amazing.
What happens if my hardware goes down?  Either from user error, or the fact it's running on 10 year old hardware?  I could see how an RPi might be ideal for this.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:48:02
I've recently been considering the same. What are the suggested hardware requirements for running a full node? I'm getting fiber installed tomorrow and want to try donating some processing power. Can I just dedicate some old hardware for this? Or would it be better to just invest in an RPi? I've got a dual core box, 4GB ram currently running OMV3. I could wipe it and run ubuntu server, I guess. Those instructions seemed pretty straightforward. Thank core team!
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:30:21
Oh wow, you are a genius.  I hadn't bothered checking the log file (yet).  I am NOT a developer, although i work with a team of .NET guys, i'm in more of a support / devops role.  But i am super excited about the limitless potential of the blockchain.  And have a ball with bad little projects in my home office/lab.  I may invest in an RPi to dedicate to the full node.
Since i get paid in BTC, it'd eventually be nice to be self-sufficient and not have to rely on Coinbase, or whichever.  But starting out, CB made it rather easy to begin using right away and learning as i go.  But i need to break it a few times and understand what it will take to fix it, know that i won't have any issues backing up / recovering my private key, and so on.

Bravo.  It deserves the most violent, gory form of skull crushing imaginable.

Awesome, thanks you for the break down!  Is there any advantage to running multiple instances on various pcs?  The fiber is only 100/20, but big upgrade from cable's current 20/2.

I first saw this a handful of days ago and started to type out a message to a friend, *"is this real. . ."* -- thankfully before i pressed send and embarrassed myself, I did ~90 seconds of research and it was painfully obvious this was NOT in any way real.  Whew, disaster averted.  Do people lack the time, or desire to fact check things?  My better half is NOT super savvy with technology, but no longer will even attempt to start a conversation without being prepared to cite the source of information regarding &lt;insert topic here&gt; -- perhaps I'm annoying to have to deal with, but it's made both of our lives SIGNIFICANTLY better.

This particular wallet is old as dirt, without SegWit support, so clearly I'm part of the problem.  I need to invest a little bit of effort to create a new wallet that supports current formats &amp; addresses (SegWit / Bech32).  Although, I'm not really sure how well Bech32 adoption has caught on -- don't think the Ledger Live app even supports it, but at least hardware wallets support SegWit.  It's the "hot" wallets with minuscule amounts that cause much grief.
I started tinkering and attempted to add a Lightning Node on top of my Bitcoin Core full node, but failed, so ended up rolling back and restoring the VM snapshot immediately prior to my failed attempt.  I've made a couple copies of the full blockchain data (surprisingly it was only ~217GB, i thought it would be larger by now) and might just try to start from scratch and rebuild everything, because I've since added a web server on top of my (essentially unused) Bitcoin Core Full Node, but was leaving it running to try and help do my teeny little part to support the network checking / confirming transactions...
I really messed something up with my tinkering, I also had the grand delusion to try and add [Statoshi]( on top of my node (which is what also prompted the web server) and now I can't seem to get my status to appear online when checking port 8333 via: 
TL;DR -- I've made a real mess of things, across the board and have no idea how to dig myself out of this hole.  It's still running and keeping updated, but I'm all turned around in circles with no idea where to even begin to remedy this unless I just roll everything back again and wait for the node to update:

Ya, my old second generation i3 seems to be handling it alright.  I gave it 3 (of the four total) cores and way too much RAM.  But i've learned a lot.  I hate to bring it down at this point, it's been humming along nicely, but i've gotta reconfigure my loadbalancer.  Took me two full days to verify.  I think the first 24 hours was the ~120GB download of the full block chain, then another full day+ to verify.  What OS are you running this on?  If i redo it, i'll probably use Linux Mint instead of Ubuntu Server.  My skills aren't strong enough with the command line to be competent.  =\

Unconfirmed Transaction Count in the mempool seems to have spiked quite significantly in the past 24+ hours, or so... but 1 sat / byte TX are still getting through?  I had a transaction take quite some time to clear, but went to bed and woke up and it was fine... so guess things aren't *that* bad.
But ya, what's up with the uptick recently?

Hoping to move this soon, but trying to reconfigure my load balancer and LAN today before diving back into wr0k.  Duty calls.  Not as much time for my bad little projects as i once had.  I assume you are 100% correct on the constant read/writes degrading any solid state device over time.  Thanks again for sharing, sir!
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:44:34
That's a pretty great use of your system.  You are way farther than i am.  Been hesitant to trust myself managing private keys until i learn to recover it a couple times.  However, I've reach 6 days 17hours of uptime. Real-life, excuses, excuses... poor full node that i was so excited to get going has mostly been ignored for a week now.  
Thank you immensely for sharing an update!  I trimmed down the number of cores (from 3 to 1) in my Ubuntu Server VM and scaled the RAM back to 2048MB at which point i also moved the physical disk from the 256GB Crucial ssd to a spinner, 2TB Hitachi Desk Star, that's in this pc hosting backups of most of my media, etc.  Should probably grow the ~150GB disk space i allowed in the same, aforementioned VM.  I was worried the constant little read/writes all day, all night would end that Crucial ssd before long.  I probably should follow your practice and designate a full disk to it.

What's the best way to go about trying this new version if I'm currently running 0.14.0 full node, no pruning?  I'm not super experienced and only have been running a couple weeks. Probably should leave the testing to more knowledgeable folk, but it's hard not to get excited.
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:04:14
This is a really short-sighted view.  I spun up an Ubuntu Server VM quickly after work one evening to try and do something to support the community without adding to the noise, so assumed a Core 0.14.0 full node was the best way i knew how to go about doing that.  There's plenty of Alt-coins that won't ever get too popular if you prefer that nostalgia feel.
Interesting to hear sentiment exists for an essentially failed virtual currency experiment.  Perhaps i misunderstood the goals, but you don't revolutionize the world with a few dozen people.  On a side note, i hear BBSes are making a come-back.  Maybe that'll get you the little slice of heaven you are sorely missing.

u/toxicacd &amp; u/-Hayo- what do i owe ya?  Lemme make sure i've gotten this nonsense out... but i was able to successfully import the private key of the specific address in question into Mycelium, where the 12 word mnemonic had failed multiple attempts previously.

I still use "Happy happy, joy joy" to this day as a generic FarkBork or whatever bday greeting.  Simple, yet effective.
Is it wrong that Ren &amp; Stimpy caused me to *WANT* to urinate on electric fences?  The idea hadn't crossed my mind prior to that cartoon.  Meeeemories.

I was never sure if it was the old i3-2120 that couldn't keep up, or lack of IOPS on a 1TB WD Black.

I hate how much I have to agree with you regarding the basic requirements to spin up a full node and help support either network.  My BTC VM requires 2vCPU, 4GB RAM &amp; 500GB spinning rust and it's been humming along nicely for years now.  Think I'm on version 0.18.1 these days.  No issues, super easy to update (and backup the entire blockchain) and can run on pretty much anything.  Granted, I haven't attempted to add any lightning channels, but it's wildly underutilized.
I'm tried to run both Geth and Parity, on Windows and Linux and couldn't ever get a node to finish syncing without pruning things down.  Even then, it was hit or miss.
If anyone cares to poke through some current information regarding [Ethereum 2.0]( there was a decent Medium post the other day I have saved for future reading.

Ohsosad.  Poor OP indeed.  What are my realistic options here?  Should i be trying to import my seed phrase to a new wallet?  The balance appears to me on the Blockchain when searching... i'm not going crazy here, am i?
Well, let's be honest... that ship has sailed.  But i don't believe this is one of the ways my kRaZeE has manifested itself.

As I blurted out elsewhere, it is (and should remain) expensive to be stupid.  It's unfortunate, this human nature... having to learn things the hard way.  Oh, how I wish i were immune.

I used to have a friend named Tom, from MySpace, but we've since lost touch. Think he got into the music business... with Rupert.

To quote the late, great Notorious: "99 problems... but a b*tch ain't one."  Good for you.  That's quite the tale.  It's difficult for the bulk of the country to realize how very different rural America can be.  I've known these to be very dark places where facts carry little weight.
Keep on keepin on, sir.  Continue investing in yourself and more good things will happen.

Lulz, yer almost certainly correct.  This day has already been somewhat long.  I stand corrected.  Not sure if that makes it funnier (by how bad i am with the failed reference) or if it's just sad.  Ahh well, live to fight another day.

The perfect response that i hear to this (it comes up often at work with clients from hell), but we fall back on -- "okay, so by your logic, if you put 9 women together they should be able to have a baby in a month, correct?")
That doesn't seem to shut them down, but it at least gives them pause to consider the scaling situation in a way they may not have previously.

Had an 18+ month contract gig where we had the option to be compensated directly in BTC. I was a little leery, as I knew essentially nothing in early 2017, but turned out to be a wonderful learning experience.  Wish I had sold less sat the beginning when I was so worried about the price dropping from 1200 to 900 and sold more in December when it was dancing around that ATH 19k mark. Expensive lessons to learn, but what a wild ride. I could have taken some early retirement if I weren't so bad. Now I get to work till I'm seventy-five, assuming I love that long.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending upon your perspective) most folks have no idea how the legal system works.  I wouldn't suggest anyone attempt to gain first hand knowledge, unless you have very deep pockets.
