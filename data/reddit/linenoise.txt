1500 blocks.  But it probably goes up a touch or stays about the same.

The tx/s and ensuing fee issues are major problems and I think the rise we've seen recently in LTC and ETH is, whilst partially driven by general crypto hype, a significant amount of "utility flight".
With cryptocurrencies of no intrinsic value beyond their utility, I'm of the opinion this significantly undermines the worth of Bitcoin and I'm out entirely presently until such time as I see a return of utility (my figure for that is back into the 20-30 sat/B range) or a clear use case established that is fulfilled despite the tx/s limit.

Noticed something interesting.
After adding Hive iOS to my iPad a few hours after I got it going on my iPhone and transferring a few fractions of a coin I noticed that my wallet address has changed.
Is this expected behaviour?  Does the old address still work?
Might be something worth communicating to users more clearly in either case.

Mine have been moving to received after just 1 I'm pretty sure.

You could maybe have a left or right swipe on the values change the unit / currency whilst the tap alternates between BTC and USD etc. as it does now.

It seems to ask me for a PIN when the app is opened after being actually killed (either manually or preempted) but not if it's just been sitting in the background.
Would be nice to have it lock every time like 1Password does or, given the latency involved in that unlock, an option to set the time window to X minutes.
I'm on iOS 8 if that makes any difference.
I've also noticed it doesn't handle an extremely slow connection very well.  A timeout when first synchronising the wallet will never resume without manually killing the app if it times out on the first attempt.  Again, maybe iOS 8 being a little weird.

Hmm, definitely not something I've seen except for immediately after the transaction.
Tried looking it up off the public address?  Also, it might be worth trying manually closing and restarting the app to force a full resync.

Very slick.
I presume we'll see the OS X app move in a similar direction shortly?
Grabbed the app and set up a wallet.  Will need to do some reading on how all this new stuff works before I throw some money in it.  I'm very behind the times on this tbh.

Probably won't be that long but it also probably won't be until the Apple Watch rolls around.
One of the example apps at the Watch announcement was NFC based entry for hotels so the API is out there somewhat.  I'd be stunned if they opened that up for the Watch and not the iPhone.

Ouch at no seed.
Hopefully 2.0.3 fixes it.  It's rather unhelpfully listed as "various bug fixes" in TestFlight.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:05:05
Seems to be a known issue on 10.3.3
You could put the 5s on iOS 11 but I'd understand why you might not want to.
Edit:  I note that there's a 2.0.3 version in TestFlight at the moment if you've got access.

Not OP but for me I had huge issues with it getting very, very wrong balances.  Looked like it wasn't taking into account some transactions and you'd get a total that made no sense at all.
Following some advice from a friend I cleared the wallet out of the app, deleted it, reinstalled it and resynced the wallet.  It's been fine since but it's shaken my trust in it a little.
Just resyncing or reloading the wallet wasn't enough but deleting the app with it already purged seemed to be the magic trick.

The lightning camera kit lets you plug in keyboards and what not.  It may work here.

Hardware isn't, connection still is in many markets.
Ignore the initial sync size, just the ongoing upload required will happily cripple ADSL if you're trying to use it for anything else.
A built in, simple and solid speed limiter, up and down, is needed.  The current methods are way beyond the abilities of most users.
