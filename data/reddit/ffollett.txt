Edit: well the above has been completely rewritten, so this doesn't really apply anymore. 
Really? The "biggest polluter in the world"? Says who? The EPA doesn't even produce anything that could cause pollution. The worst case is like your first article, where they're working on containing *someone else's pollution* and fuck it up. 
Neither article you linked demonstrates that either incident is "directly-attributable to EPA decision-making", and, in fact, you've confused the OEPA (a state run environmental agency who "overlooked the lead levels in the park) with the EPA (the federally run environmental agency tasked with fixing the problem) in your second article. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 18:26:48
Read the article. They're comparing the methods for infiltrating Playpen to the methods used to infiltrate Silk Road, which was a pretty significant part of the bitcoin economy for a while. It's addressing issues of the legality and ability to break into networks that are designed to be anonymous/pseudonymous. This can have really important reprocussions for the parts of he btc community that put a very high value on privacy. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 18:29:18
It's related in that they're using it to speculate about the Ulbricht case. They tie it together toward the end of the article.

Someone who is an active bitcoin dev better damn well know more about bitcoin than I do as even an informed observer. It's not about them being "smarter" than us, it's about them having more experience and intimate knowledge of the topic. Just because my area of expertise isn't bitcoin doesn't mean I'm some run-of-the-mill retard. But it does mean that someone who's area of expertise *is* bitcoin should be assumed to know more of it than I do.

Yeah, from my understanding, it's instantaneous for merchants actually getting the funds *in their account* compared to waiting days for it from credit card companies.  However, it is actually significantly longer for consumers waiting for a transaction to be confirmed by the merchant.

Most people in the world don't go around with their faces covered. When they do, it's often because they're doing something that's not allowed and don't want to be identified. The mask has a connotation of illegality, or at the last defiance.

I think you're under estimating their power and ignoring where that power comes from. They neglected to fix all those "problems" you mentioned, screwed over a huge amount of the voting block in a 'democratic' society, and in large part got away with it. That's highly related to the amount of money (read influence) that banks like jp, chase, bofa, etc have. They can game the system to work in their favor and do so on a regular basis.

Bittorrent. It was really popular until things like Netflix and hulu (tax paying companies that are legal) came along. Torrenting still happens, sure, but I don't think it's as common in markets where Netflix is an option. Maybe my friends and I aren't an accurate representation, but that's what I've witnessed. It's not that the government shut it down, so much as made a system in which the alternative had a better cost/benefit. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:35:01
Right.  That's kindof the point I was trying to make, but I suppose I wasn't thinking of it in terms of piracy.  I guess I see the theatre/dvd market structure as analogous to the current banking system we have now.  Loosely speaking.  There are huge issues with the system and a lot of discontent customers.  Enter bitcoin.  It is analogous to bittorrent, letting people freely transfer money, and opening lots of doors.  Depending on how things go in the near future, I can see bitcoin being banned and some form of alt-coin that fixes some of btc's flaws taking the lead.  Eventually, I see some form of cryptocurrency winning out, but to bet that it will be bitcoin is something I'm not ready to do at the moment.

That's an interesting point. Computers were adopted and have become widespread without many people understanding them on a deep level. They adopted them because they knew people who had them and they saw them doing something they wanted to do. Maybe that's the issue: many people don't see the utility of a cryptocurrency. It doesn't solve an obvious problem. You've basically gotta be an economics nerd to recognize it's utility.

In my experience that is encouraged, but when a student is demonstrating genuine interest in a topic and clearly learning about it, teachers often look the other way. Personally I feel this is similar to my 4th grade "can I build a binary calculator" project.

I'm not sure who you mean by 'we', but if this is a case of assault/death/etc in the US, it will be a judge and jury that decide the appropriate amount of force.  You don't just ask the person if they think they defended themselves adequately and then only arrest them if they say "no, I was excessive".  It is not up to the assaulted party how much escalation is appropriate.
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:20:28
I respectfully think thats a general problem with this sub.  I don't "want to believe in bitcoin".  I want it to work, but I try to be as realistic about it as possible.  It's got a lot of problems (as does any young technology) that need to be solved before large-scale adoption can occur without leading to catastrophe.  I'm not exactly sure what the last part of your post is getting at, but hiding billions or trillions in a public ledger system doesn't sound entirely feasible to me.

I think you'll find that there is an inverse correlation between how widespread government is and how widespread war is.  I know that it's usually governing bodies that wage 'war', but the more widespread/established these governing bodies are, the less frequent/deadly the wars are.
Most people prefer this.  Dying from war is an incredibly unlikely occurence in many countries these days.  That wasn't always the case.  If you think you can build a society you prefer, I think you should have that opportunity.  I wish there was somewhere you could go to just start a new country.  I wouldn't bet on your success, but I think you should be able to do it.  It's a shame we can't split up countries easier, but thus far that basically NEVER goes well (I'm looking at you, Israel).

Officer on the scene is not the assaulted party.  You're agreeing with me now.  It's not the assaulted party that decides howmuch force is appropriate.  That is defined legally, and, if needed, an officer or a court will investigate it to make that determination.

This is what I'm wondering about.  Anything you want to rent processing power or storage space for, there are tons of services out there that could provide it for way cheaper than I could by opening my pi up to the internet and letting people log into it and give it tasks.
His AirBnB example sounds good, but it only really works for computers that I already have running 24/7 (or I guess more often than I'm using them for).  But it seems like google/amazon/digitalOcean etc are all going to be able to offer much more stable resources with more customization available than what you'd get from logging into my gaming rig while I'm sleeping.  Plus there seems like there would be security concerns involved.
