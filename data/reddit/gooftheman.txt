Thanks. I'm laughing so hard. Tears are flowing.

So if I take it into BTC-e and exchange for USD, wait an hour for the price to drop, then buy BTC again at a gain, do I have to pay taxes? What if I do it 10 times a day? Do I pay taxes every time?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:28:11
I'm not worried at all man
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:15:57
what do you mean by "Skyrocket short term"?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:07:33
memorized. It was a URL. Not telling you to what though.

I only have to pay taxes if I convert back to USD and deposit it my bank, right?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:34:32
Ive had the coins for 3 years.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:05:42
I think I might just do that for shiggles.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:05:22
Yeah!

Transferred them from my Qt application to Coinbase, I don't feel safe with $50k on my computer. What if it crashes?
EDIT: Bought ~$50 worth on GOX at  on November 6, 2010
EDIT 2: I am not in the know about BTC. I want to take all precautions to safeguard my coin. I hear rumors of a crash to 250, then back up within the next few weeks. Should I sell now for fiat then buy back in at 250? What do? PM me if you are in a serious place to help.

They seem reputable, I did some research before transferring. What is a "Paper Wallet"?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:06:24
You sign in with email anyways
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:57:24
Already did. I use Authy for work.

Bloomberg, eh? seems legit. I still don't feel 100% secure though.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:03:07
I have 2-factor authentication and a &gt;30 character password. I was not scared :P
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:06:25
Changed the password. I shouldn't have said it was a URL
