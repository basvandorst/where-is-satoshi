Yes but  the first rule  of gambling is to only spend money you're willing to part with. That's  why,  like I mentioned, I wasn't expecting the cash so I'm ok with spending it. I don't care if the value falls down to a cent, as long as it never officially "closes" or whatever/however, I don't mind waiting, I got decades ahead of me haha

Interesting alright, I'll make sure to do more googling before trading

I've done a decent amount of research into bitcoin and I kind of have one basic question (which  I'm sure is asked a lot). How much  different is it than stock? I got paid 100 bucks thru cashapp for something and I had, in my mind, written off the money and planned around it, not expecting to be paid. So when I finally did I thought oh  neat,  and then noticed cashapp lets you buy bitcoin, and thought  it might be neat to spend this money on the equivalent of 100 bucks worth of btc (I guess right now that would be around .01 BTC, right? I  know some places charge a fee for purchasing  crypto so I might only get  like $98 worth instead, but then I can basically just sit on it, and if it ends up being worth, say, $20,000 again, then I  just "trade it in" for $200 now? That just seems a little too easy. I know some people try and daytrade but I'm not looking to do that. I know with stocks you have to actually sell it to someone (and buy them from someone) so prices aren't always exact, but would btc be a little more instantaneous? Thanks for any feedback, thought it might be a neat experiment with some spare change I got.
