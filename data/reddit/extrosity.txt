We are seeing the same thing that happened in the US this morning. At 11:30 eastern time we saw bitcoin drop a bunch. It is currently 11:45 in china, see a relationship?

I've been following it for years and have a generally solid viewpoint on it, just saying that for this week in particular I have gone above and beyond.

Not really negatively impacting, just selling a lot off right now. There is a somewhat large wall of people holding to buy right at a price point of 13,500. When this wall hits, we will likely stop the downward trend and reverse. Truth is, people are scared and want out right now. I am very keen as to see the effect that the futures market has on bitcoins in the next few months.

Just a bit new to electrum. And anything I'm putting in I am 100% ready to lose. This was from an old account a few years ago.
I'd did a brief google search on the topic but wasn't finding what I was looking for. So I come to my friendly Reddit community to gain more up to date insight.

Looks like the drop was accurate, let's see if she can climb now and to the best guess I could possibly go for we should climb until 8-9am eastern time then expect a drop for 3-5 hours.

It was more so if you guys had any insight into the time for certain fees to process through.

I think it is about to jump much more then I thought, check out the order book, currently being purchased at this second is 4,080 BTC on bitterex, and 1,100 BTC being sold. 
Most of these are ask requests to automatically buy if bitcoin reaches this price, the buy order outnumber the sell order 4:1

Your 100% correct, nobody has any idea what is going to happen. I am simply trying my hardest to find any sort of relatable pattern to go off of. Most of the investment analysis has tried to apply the same analysis from stocks and Fiat currencies. But we all know this is a new bull. And nobody should be buying bitcoin unless they are prepared to lose it all. 
At the same time I do believe that a vast majority of people are completely prepared to lose all of it. Which is the main reason that unless we see a major point of failure in bitcoin. It is going to continue to stay valuable

Market assumption that I feel comfortable making based on certain aspects that I described. But at the end of the day every single person here needs to accept failure and brace for impact.
