So much idiocracy in this post. So much stupid out there....

This article reeks of bullshit. Don't be so naive to take it at face value.

A guy from California getting publicity for being a mysterious figure head responsible for a huge cultural phenomenon....no way...not in California.....Hahaha I'm moving to Hollywood to be a star

Agreed. I do see profit potential in such trends though albeit very temporary. I speculate a few altcoin will hold on as bitcoin gains the global momentum. Where are the best places to buy or trade altcoin or is that all a matter of opinion?
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:17:33
FedCoin, The more you mine the less its worth! The altcoin for indebtedness.

Nice question! For me it is the symbol of revolution. A way for people to purge their (metaphorical) bodies of the parasitic banking cartels. I mean I really really hate banks. Basically I'm against anything that stifles ingenuity. Two years ago I laughed at bitcoin, now I see how powerful it will be. I think it is humanity's next great tool. And the more we can make this a global phenomenon the better off we will all be. I just hope greed doesn't ruin another good thing.

This is so awesome. I want to do this in L.A. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:26:26
The group of people I associate with usually are the kind of people to point out an error and then help solve the problem. By only pointing out what you think is wrong shows me you look too much at the negative of things. Ain't nobody got time for that. Also by simply illustrating what you think is wrong you could show reddit what you're talking about, properly correct me, probably teach a few things to people who might not know, and end up looking like a champ. Cheers.

I see daytrading tactics for not so popular altcoins. I wont hold on to anything except btc for now.

How is the hand backwards? Thanks for the critique....cough
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:29:55
You should post a picture of your drawing showing the correct position of the hand and muscle groups in the arm based off my slight interpretation of "¿reality?". All I used for reference was a mirror. I could easily correct my painting, I like what I did, but I'd like to see a more dynamic posture if possible. If you could render that on 18 x 24 sheet of paper that would be great.

Jorge followed you up with a .55 offer. Judging by the response I will have another piece in a few days. Same theme, wizard and Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:46:53
The problem it solves for me is that I can convert my paycheck into bitcoin and not keep my money in a bank. It puts me in control of my finances. I don't get charged a monthly fee or ridiculous overdraft protection fees. Also, I'm an artist and I sell my work strictly for btc. It makes transactions extremely simple and fast. I've never had to wire money but I've been with friends who use those services. Btc can streamline all of that for a fraction of the cost. I'm not worried about wealth accumulation or riding btc only to profit. Only to keep me doing what I love doing, art. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:47:00
So is leetcoin only for PC? Do you think xbone and ps4 will implement anything like this?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:14:24
Too much speculation. Anyone selling is doing so out of fear. A tip for noob traders...don't let emotion dictate direction. But I'm glad the greedy are jumping ship. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:47:49
Thanks! Yep I'll send it to the highest bidder
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:07:03
Thank you very much Jorge! I will mail tomorrow at once :-) I had no idea this would happen ..I'm relatively new to reddit as well so forgive me if I'm slow

Always educate yourself on matters of investment. Knowledge is your best weapon. My advice, take it with a grain of salt, is invest an amount you're comfortable losing. Test the waters and definitely do not put all your eggs in one basket.

Just fiddling out some bitcoin wizard concepts before bed. Sorry for the large picture. I found that I will never reveal the wizard's face as the mystery of Satoshi is to much fun. So I'll stick with mystical mysterious wizard theme for now

Coinbase worked flawlessly for me. I don't know whats wrong with other people, but it all went down like it should. Ill try localbitcoins next just to meet fellow bitcoiners. They're pretty scarce where im residing.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:24:48
Just what happened...I draw it out and go with it.

Thank YOU very much everyone! Especially Jorge! I am very awestruck still kinda floating here....I will definitely start working on a new piece. :D

I'd like to auction it off for btc. I'll probably start it around 0.45btc if there's enough interest later in the evening. I'm on Pacific standard time

My 2¢. Bitcoin will not replace every currency being implemented. Bitcoin works because it fills gaps and provides solutions for problems with modern currency. It's a modern currency for a younger generation who are ready to move out from the draconian past. Think future, space travel and colonization of our solar system. Think about how digital replaced tangible. Think about that in its infancy you stood there looking at it and decided ...Eh it ain't worth it... Think that the majority of the world has no idea yet about bitcoin. But that IS changing. Change is movement, and bitcoin is moving. Even hovering around 1k is still ground floor. And my coffee buzz is gone....cheers 
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:54:51
Wow great job :)

I've been wondering about this as well. I can't wait for bitcoin to impact India! Also is there any news of a North Korean exchange? (&lt;~&lt;)

I guess it's a representation of Satoshi. But I was going for a metaphorical representation of the latent potential within all of us...... or some bullshit like that....I gotta resize the pic it's kinda small eh?
