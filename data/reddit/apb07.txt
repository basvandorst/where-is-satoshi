@_date: 2015-07-07 01:21:27
Oh ok
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:28:19
Thanks you are awesome
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:16:01
Can someone explain to me the impact of these unconfirmed transactions?
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:33:33
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:40:40
first wuestion. What are your goals with bitcoin? short term long term?
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:35:51
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:54:29
that has been me for the last couple days
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:38:50
its driving me crazy watching it go up and up and i get to just sit here and cry
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:27:32
that would be saweeeeet
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:34:23
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:55:39
agreed same goes for us americans 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:04:56
last month? nice so you have some good stacks in bitcoin i imagine
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:00:03
no im waiting for them to put small deposits into my bank account so i can verify it. they say it can take up to 3 business days buuuuuut its been four
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:46:36
it seems like this is going to be what kills the confidence in bitcoin. Why would someone put thousands of dollars into something that has poor security? its going to take time to get the education out on how to properly manage bitcoin. If word spreads that everyone is getting hacked no one will buy into this could be revulutionary idea
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:01:52
doubt it
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:49:37
no but from what i have been reading. someone will buy bitcoins on a site like coinbase or mt.gox and leave it on there. Then post that they have been hacked and lost all of there bitcoin. Not many people know how to make a paper wallet it seems. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:03:33
its torturous absolutely killing me
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:32:04
i havent even invested yet still waiting the two deposits to my account to verify the bank account then i can buy
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:29:41
yea valid point probably a deeper root than BTC
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:35:27
yea it seems that people dont understand that you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin and therefore dont invest
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:36:23
for now
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:45:22
then get out while the price is ok. i  wouldnt waste your time stressing its not worth it. i only have what i can afford to lose i think i am going to not pay attention to it anymore and check in ten years when it is worth zero lol
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:35:26
as long as you arent investing more than you can afford
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:04:24
is that right? im not familiar with AML/KYC. i know that FDIC banks and credit unions play by different rules. basically i dont know wtf is going on im just anxious
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:39:52
im wondering if it is because i belong to a credit union. My buddy is at wells fargo and they are damn near instant verification. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:34:59
you sound like a good father
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:27:29
Well what do you know about bitcoin now? And where do you see it in ten yesrs?
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:07:06
fantastic ill be on it when i get off of work thank you!
