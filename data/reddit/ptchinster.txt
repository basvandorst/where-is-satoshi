Time to sell and invest that into SPY or something.

That's where BTC is heading if we don't increase the number of transactions in a block.

When  did you buy? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:56:59
Not according to the stock chart.  Maybe 125 euros a year ago?

Have you looked up what an etf is bro?

More people trying to time the market means i have a better shot making pretty steady and sure gainz. To each their own.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:00:08


Oh yeah? What incredibly high risk stock did you invest in?

Do you realize, at all,  the difference between a crypto currency and stock in a company?

The tech can scale by changing the arbitrary size of the structure of the block. Instead of allowed a max of CURRENT tx's per block, just edit the code to allow 2*CURRENT tx's per block. It should require a couple of changes to the code, some testing, then the update.

Eh thats just a saying. I believe in $MSFT thats why im long their stock. Its not a question of thinking MSFT is real or not, but i believe they will continue to give me gainz.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:58:21
Havent gained anything either
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:27:17
Glad to hear that. I've done some pretty sweet shit.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:35:14
The folks want it to stay that way, whereas and other CCs have allowed a more flexible system. Again, most people on today have never heard of or read the whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:01:59
Most people on dont, otherwise they would be for increasing the block size.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:28:59
I believe that believers of $MSFT will be rewarded as well, but i do see your point. The difference is Crypto has nothing to stand on, whereas MSFT has decades of being the top dog, a OS that most computers run on, that the world knows, a full Office Suit, video game platform, etc etc etc and crypto just feelz good.

Boy ive never seen BTC explained like a pyramid scheme so well. And i have some.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:42:42
Unless it 1.) falls to 0 or 2.) Never goes above the weighted average price you bought in at.

Great, then vote GOP. The IRS is a waste and we should just move to a flat tax or "The Fair Tax".
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:48:18
Dude, pay your taxes like all the other adults. Or overthrow the IRS. Pick 1.
