Thank for clarifying. I’m still a noob about a lot of things bitcoin. My logical brain ran with with difficulty increasing we would see exponentially less coins entering circulation. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:25:23
I voluntarily buy more bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:45:07
I just made two buys with them. Hahahahaha. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:27:20
If I send from a non segwit address to a segwit address, will I lose my coins? Have high fees?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:39:56
Thanks for the head up. I’ll keep an eye on it. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:38:51
Im buying as fast as I can!!! lol. I try to buy every two weeks, but no more than $100 USD
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:21:20
You’re right. My response was a knee jerk reply to the title. Not in there brokerage stuff at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:51:39
Honest question. With difficulty constantly increasing is it true that the remaining 20% will take another 10 years so? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:46:37
I will be buying more once next payday hits. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:44:41
What is actually driving the price down? I know South Korea got unexpectedly removed from some exchange calculations and the China is slowing move out of Bitcoin mining. I'm not worried to much about it right now as I can just sit back and wait, but I am trying to learn what drives the price up and down?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:30
Yea, was quite said that I couldn't get it and sell/buy to gain an advantage. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:14:18
bought more in the dip. Sadly, its going to take forever to clear. But at least the price is locked in
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:21:09
RIght now, I'm just hodling and purchasing the dip. I'm already verified and set to go. I'm weighing out the options and will decide to move or not once all the traffic has slowed down. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:03:43
Anyone know why Coinbase Transfers are down right now?
EDIT: Nvm. figured out why. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:35:10
I’ve noticed the when bitcoin drops like this, it seems the alts drop even further and don’t recover as well. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:55:03
why not just buy using ACH? It locks in the price once you click the buy button. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:25:06
uhh what?
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:18:34
I think what he’s trying to say is that the price is up year over year? 
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:51:03
May the 4th be with us all
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:34:23
Truthfully. I’m not sure how it all works but from the looks of it all you can do is buy. There is no transferring out like a wallet. I was going to transfer in some from my own funds but it doesn’t look like you can do that yet. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:53:39
early adopter here. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:50:24
Did my part. Added another dollar cost average buy in =)
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:02:29
FOMO hitting hard!  
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:10:12
With LN still in beta, is it possible we will see a more comprehensible display of our balance in our wallets that are open on the LN? 
For instance, showing that we have .001 BTC, which is ~$8.55 at the time of this writing, could be hard for someone to comprehend. dealing with small numbers like this is outside the norm for most people who deal in fiat. Granted the franctions of say, $1 USD is easy to comprehend for most. We learn about change transaction (quarters, nickels, etc) in grade school. 
Would it be easier for people to read bitcoin balances on the LN in whole numbers? for instance, the above example would translate into 100,000 satoshi's. Correct? Please forgive me if I'm wrong in this.

Robinhood trading just went live in my State. I believe it went live for a few other states as well. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:31:14
They are slowly rolling out instant buys through ACH.
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:54:13
Will bitcoin difficulty change with this slump?! 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:12:03
Make it Stop! Make it stop!
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:44:54
I would say the only way you get back positive is keep buying. But do a dollar cost average over a decent amount of time. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:49:26
I believe I read somewhere (sorry don't remember the source) that the individuals who lost bitcoins in the hack need to re-submit a claim by October, to be paid out sometime early 2019. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:54:18
Every. Fucking. Time. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:44:49
With the news of the MTGox bankruptcy win found [here]( Should we be seeing ALOT of bitcoin changing hands? It sounds like the creditors want bitcoin and not fiat. Which is good for all of us since the Trustee won't be dumping on the market.  
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:55:14
Truthfully, I'm not worried. Mostly for comedic purposes. I'm actually glad that this might force out weak hands. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:07:56
Thanks for this information. :-) 
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:16:43
Who ever is fighting the good fight, thank you. =)
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:38:36
Scared money doesn’t make money. Even if you bought high. Just HODL. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:15:59
Is it profitable or even wise to day trade small transactions on an exchange? I have invested a pretty small amount really to learn bitcoin and see how it works. 
Thanks again
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:08:17
Can anyone think of any reason not to invest right now at the price (7889.42 GDAX at time of posting)? I want to invest, but I have fears of it plummeting again. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:49:03
Market trades have a fee. Limit trades are free. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:00:21
And here I am, not stressing. Still dollar cost averaging with each paycheck that comes in. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:12:05
[ Good high level article about what is going on. ]( 
Found this a good read on the state of things. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:05:57
Not stressing. Continuing to Dollar Cost Average every two weeks. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:16:55
My DCA is starting to feel like I’m trying to catch a falling knife. LMAO. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:20:27
I haven’t done much research in the specific details. I was only trying to highlight that the BCH hard fork is what’s is promoting this sell off/shakeup of things/dip
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:28:25
Everybody invests because they want financial gains. EVERYBODY. The difference is when people with weak hands experience the volatility of Bitcoin, or any other altcoin, panic sell and immediately complain that they lost money, creating FUD and jumping on any Ponzi scheme bubble hate train    and spreading bad information through word of mouth. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 05:06:01
Please for the love of god pay your capital gains tax. :-) 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:48:10
Can I be in as a believer of the tech as well as a long buck?
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:55:17
I really hope these price jumps stay out of mainstream media. I would hate to see people getting all FOMO about it and buying in only for a whale to come in and short the whole gawddamn thing and us all re-living confetti cannons launching falling knives. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:31:44
Lol, sticking to my dollar cost average buys...watch it tank now. :P
In all seriousness, I'm glad we are starting to see positives. The last 6 months have been a rough ride. It definitely has shaken up the whole Bitcoin Community. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:54:53
Did all the altscoins just drop? Are people liquidating into Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:20:22
Is this steady decline the calm before the storm? The storm to 20k?
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:55:48
Thanks for the on point explanation =)
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:42:54
Why the price? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:56:15
Have we hit bottom? Can I buy now? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:38:47
anyone else thinking we are gaining too fast?
