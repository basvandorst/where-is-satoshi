Okay so one last thing, why would people want to use normal coinbase vs coinbase pro if the prices are much better on pro? Sorry if this is a noob question...

I just recently purchased a Ledger Nano S in order to store my btc. I read that if you deposit btc from coinbase to coinbase pro, the fees to transfer are free. I’m currently away and haven’t been able to try this out, so I do not know the legitimacy of that quite yet. My main concern was when purchasing btc, it seems as though coinbase marks up the coin you buy by a good deal. And I have no idea what I’d have to go through when it comes to selling. Ik all the hodlers would say to just don’t sell, but I’ve got my own goals of where I want to cash out as my funds aren’t unlimited. So is cash app the way to go for both buying AND selling?
Sorry, I honestly didn’t realize how long this got.

I’d say I’m pretty new to bitcoin, and recently I’ve been just buying my crypto on coinbase. As I read more and more, it seems to me that there are better/cheaper exchanges to use when buying crypto. Do you guys have any suggestions? I’ve been considering switching over to Kraken, would that be a good choice? Thx in advance

Unless I’m mistaken and I’ve been reading it incorrectly this entire time, it means Fear of Missing Out.
