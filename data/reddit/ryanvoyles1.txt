Why did you get downvoted for passing out a Satoshi?

Good job with making it rain reddit gold. Also, TO THE MOON!

Kinda wondering, how often do subs hit 100k or more that are not default subs?
@_date: 2013-07-20 02:43:44
Do you happen to be in Sioux Falls? I recognize that neighborhood. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:45:06
Dipped again.

Here comes the down turn. The fucking government is trying to ruin something great again. Why the hell do they think the world is theirs?!

Are you guys gonna reopen or what? I want to BUY skyrim, not have it pirated. Mt. Gox isn't down now.

Or you know, you can just take my idea....

That took me on a journey of mind rape.
@_date: 2013-03-15 13:26:25
Looks fine to me.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:40:09
Sure! Or maybe we can do PlanB.net! That one is for sale.

@_date: 2013-07-03 16:21:25
I checked task manager and found user running (The exe). I ended it. The way I found this was running was windows firewall wanted permission to allow it past the firewall. I said no, like any sane person.
I know a friend didn't load it because I don't let anyone near my computer. Ever. I have not downloaded anything in a few days, and it showed up just now.
Edit: I would like to note that user.exe is supposed to be hidden. I have hidden things turned off. Someone was trying to sneak it on.

Haha, while funny, no. The pile of branches kinda tells me that it is Sioux Falls, as we had a monster ice storm a few months back that is still being cleaned up, and you see those piles everywhere. Another thing is that I think I know that house across the street, but I am not 100% sure where it is, only that it is on the North East side of town. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 03:20:43
Yep. Is that on the North East side? Or am I off?
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:04:55

Good to hear. You still modding for hcfactions? Or are you doing minez now?
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:37:29
creative. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:58:18
Just came back to see if anyone else said something. Will make it simple without much info, but I like it. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:49:55
Pretty sure I need to worry about the person buying. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 00:14:48
This comment chain shows some good proof. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:33:35
Now do that on google, and it is over.
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:56:54
I think they said they already knew it was going under, so they did the bundle anyway. Good guy THQ right?
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:55:03
But damn that bundle was good.
@_date: 2013-05-14 05:12:35
Same! Like the style, wish it was... longer I guess. Looks good for the first issue though!
@_date: 2013-07-03 17:05:00
I have not, but I guessed the config was for the phoenix mining program. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:25:25
I too got lazy and now feel sad :( 
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:16:49
I like these plan b ads. We should make a website for people to visit that explain bitcoin in an easy way. Something like PlanB.org or something. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:07:58
Woah someone needs to update the price on the bot.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:18:56
No, this was... 
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:57:40
What did the comment say?
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:17:05
Awesome. Loved the first one, and the second one is no different. Hope to see these once a week.  
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:51:27
That game isn't available.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:58:03
Wow, you are still one lucky son of a bitch. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:10:02
Tis. It is a gamble minecraft server. Used it before, very fun.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:14:14
8620 now.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:01:15
haha I remember reading that on reddit a while back.
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:56:16
I want a certain game, but steam bits doesn't have it. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 12:28:59
Confirmed, did a cash exchange earlier today.  
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:28:01
Didn't know you were into bitcoins amo! Long time no see. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:15:35
Very nice story. I am happy things can work out, and that you were able to notice something like this. I was looking at bitcoin a few years ago, maybe 2 or 3, and thought about checking it out more. I never followed up on it, and now look at it! When I built a new computer, I looked back at it. I was super surprised to see it at 30-25 ish. I started mining, and soon, it turned into 50, then 75, and now, 100. It really has been a rollercoaster, and I am happy to see it still chugging. Just wish I had bought into the game earlier. 
@_date: 2013-07-21 09:57:39
Well that is good to know... I guess.
@_date: 2013-06-15 03:30:38
The last jump was about that amount to. It is crazy. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:47:50
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:37:20
ALL TO KARMA!
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:32:41
Well... I mean... depending on the size of the diamonds... And how pure they are... 
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:50:16
Yeah, and you're an asshole.
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:11:10
Thank you. It is my baby, and I love her. 
Edit: She also mines at 1.2 GH/s. Hmmnmnm
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:01:22
Really don't need history to repeat itself, and it looks like it might.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:33:15
I agree.

Can I, like, kill some people please? For the good of humanity. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:32:28
Yeah, not sure why nobody got this. :(
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:53:09
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:30:55
Yeah it was. I think I may have made some people mad. :(

Dude what the hell... You win  redditor!

Quicky comment to save.

HOLY SHIT A $100 TIP?!
@_date: 2013-03-15 06:29:46
Oh my god how did I not know about this. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:15:09
I know right? Like, 1 hour after I made it, BOOM.
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:58:37
Omg, make this a thing now.
@_date: 2013-03-10 21:15:11
Wow, that looks awesome. 
+tip roll verify
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:55:56
My guess is 50 them it will stay stable for a week ish. I hope it just goes up from here, and history doesn't repeat itself. Though if it does, I can get a few while they are cheap. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:09:09
Well, Litecoins for one.
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:29:09
Hey, my friend wants to get into bitcoins, but he thinks it is a pain in the ass to go through mtgox. Would you sell him bitcoins? If so, go ahead and pm me. I will get in contact with him. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:54:30
I will sell you it. That is it. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:48:49
I hope that we can get something like it back up, I love the idea of a reddit mining team. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 06:38:04
Awesome. Have you talked to *insert HCFactions owner here (Forgot his name)* about accepting bitcoins as a payment method for things on the server?
@_date: 2013-06-18 08:26:26
That is a few months ago.. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:26:39
TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:20:36
Thanks for doing this! Sucks I got here late, but good to see server time was at 150% for one day goal. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 14:35:57
+tip flip
One more time
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:49:04
This is wonderful! Thank you! Is this going to be a weekly show?
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:06:46
Yep. And my wallet just got that much more worth it. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:45:46
I might be able to mock something up in photoshop later if I have the time, or maybe InDesign. But someone else would need to make the website. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 06:21:26
Don't suppose you could add Sioux Falls? I have been bringing people over to the way of the bitcoin, and this would be awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:50:48
I would sell you some via paypal, but it would need to be at a slightly higher rate than other exchanges, as trust is an issue with buying with credit cards. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 11:38:57
That last one looks like Logan a little bit...
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:49:19

Don't use bitly. Ever. I will not click that link. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:59:10
Yeah for new computers with bitcoins! I spread this out, and bought a few things before the crash.
