Not really, I just think it's an imperfect model of a potentially good thing but I don't see it as working. Try not to make it Ron Paul 2012: The Currency next time and you might enjoy more success. That's all. *You* fuck off.

Makes exactly as much sense as mentioning msnbc. 
But yeah, I'm probably an illuminati build-a-burger shill. No one could possibly take an interest in historical economic philosophy and *not* come out the other side a goldbug and a libertarian. Anyone who claims otherwise is a JIDF false flag agent.

Creepy. What a shock we're on opposing ends of the political spectrum, though. On this subject though the only difference between us is that I saw the problem with bitcoin before the crash, because I don't share your economic philosophy. 
Plus side, we both talk about Hayek and Bastiat a lot so we have that in common.

To be sure he was wrong on that, even if I agree with some of his points on the subject. I don't think bitcoin is without impact, but I also do not think that it's the future of currency. Something like it may be, though.

Yuh huh. The fact that I'm engaging with you in a deleted thread that criticizes bitcoin (OMG censorship) indicates that what I'm *really* after is attention. 
My goal is to see an online currency that doesn't come with tonnes of political baggage, but nah I'm sure it's just me messing everything up for you guys.

People without legs I guess. I was just providing a counter-example because the one 101111 posted was meaningless and I wanted to show him that. He might even be right, but any idiot like me can point out that more technical doesn't universally mean better.

Because a ubiquitous online currency would be awesome provided it's done sensibly. Would you prefer we didn't keep trying to invent one? I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:17:09
Who needs segways when we already have legs?

I'll happily pass on your justifications. If you don't want people to think bitcoin is the currency of choice for paranoid tinfoil hatters, stop letting your currency get so cozy with them. Wriggle all you want, you can't escape a stigma you giddily made for yourselves when you thought it served you.

I can't deny that. Also, most people have a very societally-founded conception of currency unit value. I'm just one of those future utopians who want to believe that in future there'll be a single currency usable in all situations worldwide, and I'm not convinced it will be the dollar despite the penetration it already has in other world markets. 
Incidentally it certainly won't be bitcoin either, which was true even prior to the crash. It seems to make an entertaining commodity though.

I only listen to Alex Jones so I'll know when Ron Paul has finally destroyed Ben Bernanke and the evil fed, as well as HAARP chemtrails, something about the UN, and the NWO.  The sheeple need to know when it's safe to drink tap water again so they can stop using their BERKEY^TM water filters and Beyond Tangy Tangerine. 
On that day, wacky conspiracy theories will be free to roam the lands, like a really good cancer.

Couldn't find it for you, sorry. I did find [this]( however and filled it out for this very thread.

I think a good piece of advice for the next ubiquitous digital currency (because I do believe and hope there will one day be such a thing) would be not to attach so much political baggage to it. Bitcoin shot itself in the foot when it became the 'libertarian currency'. 
For example, is there any compelling reason to have links to 'Austrian Economics' and 'Anarcho-Captialism' and the libertarian subreddit in the sidebar here? I thought it was *free* of political ideology. 
That said, something new will come along that isn't run by 'end the fed' anti-government conspiracy theorists, and it'll be *awesome*.
