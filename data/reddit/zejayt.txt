Bitcoin will cease to be a store of value if fees remain outrageous. Fewer transactions = lower liquidity = lower price. The median fee is $3.5. LTC has SW, LN and a supply cap of 84 million with median fee = 0.03 c. LTC has a more compelling case as a 'store of value'

Both have advantages and disadvantages
[BCH is a poor store of value]( due to the number of transactions vs marketcap. Its overvalued, the coin isn't used compared to others of similar cap. 
However it has lower fees.
BTC can also be considered a poor store of value due to the transaction cap.. until improvements are made BTC is still fundamentally broken. The transactions have remained capped in the 300k range since 2016 but the price has risen x10 in that time. 
The demand might be for the wrong reasons, just seeing the parabolic uptrend and hopping on instead of using the currency for everyday online activities like gambling and shopping

$5 fee per transaction *revolutionary* 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:32:14
It would take x4 to x8 the number of current bitcoin transactions to fill the blocks. Having the blocks filled is not a positive, it deters liquidity. Its limiting the rate of acceptance, 350k transactions a day basically CAPPED, meanwhile ETH is handling 500k a day with 0.12 fees.  LTC is handling 25k a day with 0.03 fees, these numbers are only going up while bitcoin remains stagnant.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:23:39

The only reason GDAX transactions are free because you technically do not own the bitcoins that transfer between GDAX and coinbase, they do the transfer on their digital database, thus 0 fees. Once it's off coinbase/GDAX fees are applied on withdraw
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:51:20
You can apply [Metcalfe's Law]( to LTC, BCH, ETH, BTC to determine near the true value of the network. LTC, ETH have correlation to marketcap. BCH/BTC are overvalued/not functional, its price does not correlate at all to the number of transactions, it will eventually correct. [Solid = Marketcap Dashed = Transactions. ]( Time: 7 day moving average
It won't happen instantly, it will happen overtime as these currencies transactions continue to rise while BTC is stagnant and frankly unacceptable the [fees to make a transaction](
Also, bitcoin was hitting 300k transactions a day when it was under $1000, that was the last time it was undervalued and applied for Metcalfe's law

Then what can you purchase bitcoin with? This sub welcomes new business adoption to pump the price, but in the end [few if any purchase on these sites that accept the currency](
Businesses would much rather accept the currency if it was just that, a CURRENCY, not a commodity like gold as you are suggesting. The fees alone are destroying bitcoins chance to truly become mainstream. 
The value in bitcoin is its ability to transact first, store of value second. 
If Bitcoin cannot transact value efficiently , it will lose **ALL** value.
The fees are unacceptable.]( 
You will not see this information upvoted. It will be dismissed as FUD leading up to the hardfork fees are going to hit new all time highs as people move their coins off exchange to wallet. 
You will see personal anecdotes of users claiming they are transacting from wallet for way cheaper. However the majority of users buy their currency from exchanges and are **forced** to pay these transaction fees.

@_date: 2017-11-09 17:08:01




There are methods to determine the value right now including google trends, # of tweets, transactions in comparison to market cap. I do not care about future adoption, I just value trade on what I see right now today. You can speculate it will be adopted one day, i'll wait for technicals to back that up. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:55:22
Bitcoin's properties as currency make it a good store of value
Transactions on the network create real demand, these are purchases being made and value being transfered.
Right now transactions are hard capped, then the fees pile up, fewer individuals are inclined to purchase with bitcoin and hold the currency hoping to sell it for higher than they bought.
Eventually holders will lose out as the currency isn't liquid, fewer transfers are being made and the real value of the network will be revealed 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:55:32
It has a fair valuation dependant on the number of transactions being made, but since the transactions are capped It has far surpassed that valuation. I have to agree that the price at this point is speculative.

Until its classified otherwise it is a commodity. The current state of bitcoin is more of a commodity than currency.

Coinbase alerted customers ahead of time to withdraw as they would not immediately credit Bitcoin Cash but plan to implement it on their platform before the end of the year.

The only difference is you are confusing news for FUD. The news of China banning exchanges has been going around for days now, and many important figures are confirming they are hearing the same thing from sources they trust and cannot reveal their identity.
Charlie Lee is long on bitcoin and didn't dump, he wanted to reveal this information instead of keeping it to himself so people didn't accuse him of insider trading.
There is cause for concern, china accounts for 15% of traded bitcoin volume, for that to vanish overnight would have impact on the price of bitcoin, so people sold to account for this ahead of time.

To go long now, not the best idea, the risk reward of buying at current price 4825 isnt that good. If it hits 5000 thats only a 4% gain, it pulls back 4600-4700 thats a -4% which is more likely to happen right now. And that is only short term. If patient enough just wait for when BTC eventually has another 30-40% correction in another 2 months time and then risk reward is amazing.

Peter Brandt shared same view [here](
Its my opinion, I follow others for their ideas and getting similar views, anywhere between 3000-3800 as bottom before resuming strong uptrend in the long term. 
3000-3200 is absolute worse case, but holders should be aware that it can drop to these levels.

Consensus I'm getting from this sub, only buy bitcoin to buy and hold to make money, not use it for its intended purpose as a currency. Drop in # of transactions since May and haven't recovered to those levels but the price only goes up supports this. Literally a negative adoption curve. You want both the price and  T to be on the rise, but that is not the case. Bitcoins value will only be supported by more users
Given bitcoin's history it is a poor buy after a massive run up, its already up some 60% from the local low of 3000 and that was only 25 days ago. These swings are frequent. Why buy now when at any moment, an event can cause it to lose 30-40% from its current price?  
You won't make any significant gains buying now, although my outlook is short term
Why speculate on bitcoin when you can swing trade other volatile currencies and make that in a day.

[Ethereum fees]( are lower than ever, it would make sense to purchase things with ethereum over bitcoin where it is accepted

FUD implies that the information is false or misleading. China selling off is not misleading its an actual fact.

The current correction has nothing to do with coinbase

Bitcoin has had scaling problems since inception, still waiting on increased block sizes and reasonable fees that alternative currencies provide right now.

who trades on 1 minute candles?
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:16:57
A group with financial incentives to keep bitcoin from scaling

Hope no one did lol
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:10:01
Bitcoin is being used less as a currency and more of a means of speculative investment is what they are trying to get at
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:16:30
I didn't change my argument I explained further why companies would be better off not accepting it. The wording is bad but besides the point
[Median timeframe]( -&gt; [average fee](
10min = $3
[Average timeframe]( -&gt; [median fee](
75min = $1.5
That is about the expected outcome at fee levels, but it depends on the *time of day* you send, and Sundays are the lowest fee days.
Futures show BTC1 is currently trading -17% current BTC price, I'd say that is a huge devaluation. Granted this may close in when things are more certain as of right now it is devaluing bitcoin.
Just because I post negatively about bitcoin does not mean I am not a holder. I just absolutely hate the direction bitcoin is going. Bitcoin should have had increased transactability [YEARS]( ago (ctrl+f 4MB). 
It also feels weird they are still referring to it as electronic cash when the fees were down. Don't see that posted anymore. The *bumps in the road* had years to be fixed! 
It is frustrating how slow solutions are to fix this issue, the less transactions being made on bitcoin, the fewer people are buying it which = less money in bitcoin. Imagine a truly liquid bitcoin on &lt;10 cent transaction fees, with larger blocks we honestly could be seeing 7-8k BTC right now (take away portions of ETH and LTC cap). 
Alternatives are popping up taking bitcoins demand away. The 'digital gold' aspect is psychological, It goes against all convention the price rises while transactions are kept pretty much static due to block size limitations. It concerns me seeing the transaction numbers vs price. It would help me sleep at night knowing the [transaction  match the price](
/alt shill start 
I'm 'pumping' Ethereum by pointing out its superiority as [transactional currency] ( users are moving to [ETH]( and LTC for making cross exchange transactions and purchases (where accepted) also ETH devcon in 4 days. 
/alt shill end

I sold all my bitcoins at 4700 with technical analysis and made a prediction to eventual correction 11 days in advance [here]( 
China news only accelerated the inevitable

This chart is outdated

Only play with a % of stack instead of full. Successful traders only use 5%-10% per trade with set rules and profit greater than holding, along with 90% long hold. This only applies to traders with lots of $ to play with

BTC average transaction fee has been $1+ since march of this year

It will only fork if there is no consensus, 85% + you will just have 2 bitcoins

8 minutes is slow in comparison to other coins

Hardfork has consensus = no chain split, you will have 2 bitcoins.

[Merchants aren't accepting bitcoin]( 




Yes a reasonable company would avoid investing in adding bitcoin acceptance as it's not worth the effort due to demand
After doing further research on the vendor list provided, many do not have widespread acceptance but minor use by few franchisees. [Subway]( only has a few stores that accept bitcoin but is listed. On top of paying for the bitcoins (fees incured) sending the bitcoin (fees incured) you would have to pay capital gains on every purchase made. 
[Average Transaction time 7 day moving average](
[Average Transaction fees medium = $1.5+](
Gold has physical properties that give it inherent value, gold isn't prone to human error or politics, gold has physical properties that cannot be changed. Bitcoin however has undergone multiple contentious hard forks devaluing the network. These splits continue to devalue bitcoin as whole. 


That isn't a winning model, bitcoin should have a clear goal or intention from the start. If it's one thing this month, what will it be next month or 1 year from now? Who knows, it's all rampant speculation. When is lightning network planned to release? Is bitcoin going to stay a unusable mess until then?
The nature of bitcoin is centralized, in a true democratic system (Bitcoin should move to a proof of stake model) Only miners have a say in the network, and they will never give up power, thus this will never happen.

false, bitcoin has had 4 -30% swings this year
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:15:51
Fees are up and # of transactions is stagnant. This tweet is fake news
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:57:43
We should rely on centralized systems running off the blockchain instead of on-chain solutions, basically what you're saying
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:36:13
If you have an outlook longer than a week, there is no reason to buy now or the rest of this year
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:26:19
Have you seen the BTC/CNY charts? massive selloff going on, its currently at $2750 = 18000 CNY
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:17:28
Even so, it's just a drop in the bucket. Adding bitcoin as a payment had little to do with overstocks rise, I'm surprised this gets posted so much.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:46:40
I think you forgot the part where bitcoin was in steady decline from mt gox and lost 80% of its original value over a period of 2 years
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:05:51
It depends on the timing and severity of the catalyst. It is too early to make price predictions 
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:25:35
Yes, [bitcoin]( was originally intended as a store of value ponzi scheme. /s
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:15:16
Bitcoin price changes on average 2% daily in either direction = poor store of value
