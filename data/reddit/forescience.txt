Yes, ATMs are probably a rip off, but I've never used one. After I had proved my identity, Coinbase automatically increased my limit after I had been using it for a while, I'm up to $7500. With Gemini, I can only deposit $500/day into the exchange, which is plenty for me. I just make sure to deposit several days in a row when I think a bottom in the market is coming.

He's talking about transferring from the exchange to a wallet. You don't technically own the coins while it's in an exchange. Coinbase could implode and you would never get your coins. So you have to transfer the coins to a wallet. And you do that through the blockchain, which is a list of everyone's transactions.

Use Gemini to set a limit buy for a number you consider low balling until you get a better idea of what you want to do. That way, you won't lose out on dips.
But start transferring money into gemini now. They only accept $500/day, so it would take 20 days to even get all your money into the exchange. Unless you do wire transfers. I'd do Gemini over coinbase because of lower fees, which will eat you up on a $10k purchase.

Yup, pick your poison. You have to get coins somehow so an exchange is the easiest way unless you live near a BTC ATM. I started with Coinbase because it's simple, but then I moved to Gemini because you can set limit buys and the fees are lower. Then you start dabbling in wallets. I like Coinomi for Android because it supports a ton of coins. Your key phrase prevents you from losing your coins if you lose your phone. I've heard good things about LoafWallet for iOS, but it only does litecoin. Good luck!
