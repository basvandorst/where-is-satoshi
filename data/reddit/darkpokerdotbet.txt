You can create the account with fake inputs. There is a house but that is just to keep track and control of things. Maybe one day for multisig but we didn't make it that advaced yet. We are just trying to get a friendly game going.

Just send your coin to an exchange and switch it for monero. Your coin will me clean after you send it to a private wallet. There is no reason for any mixers.

Buy for cash in person. It is much cheaper and easier.
