How dare you.

well i try to approach everything with an open mind. just because a majority believes something to be true does not make it so. also, better to be precautionary than not imo

As a response to  the central bank has not permanent money supply cap, therefore money supply is unlimited. It is temporarily limited, but nothing is stopping the Fed from printing as much as it wants.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:21:29
I'm seeing a lot of comments attacking Bitcoin and defending fiat. Just two questions for anyone who can answer:
1) How is a system in which money has an unlimited supply sustainable?
2) What happened in Zimbabwe from the late 90s to 2008?

The crash is coming within the next two years for sure. Elliot wave theory shows S&amp;P 500 nearing the end of its 5th wave which means a big correction is coming. All this bitcoin bubble talk is just meant to distract you from the real bubble.. the debt bubble. I'm calling 1 BTC = $1 million+ by 2022.
Edit: For anyone reading this, do some fuckin research on silver please. I love crypto as much as the next guy but the absolute most undervalued asset on this planet truly is silver. It is even more undervalued than bitcoin in my opinion. Silver has been in a cup and handle pattern for about 40 years now. This is the same pattern that bitcoin broke out of early this year. Look where we are now..

its ok i don't really care what people think of me. this is reddit after all

Bitcoin will be worth $1 million by 2022. If not I will eat my dick.

I stopped reading after your second paragraph. I don't know how anyone can defend fiat. The Federal Reserve has been robbing the US blind since 1913, and nobody gives a shit. When the value of the dollars in your wallet and the value of your numbers in the banks computers goes to 0, ask yourself why you put so much trust into a system that is run by thieves. Ignorance is bliss, until it is not.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:13:08
What if at some point they do choose it to be? No one has any way of knowing whether they will or will not ever print money to a point of no return like in Zimbabwe. The fact that they have the power to do something like that doesn't frighten you?

Is it possible for me to mine the btc myself?
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:17:00
Is there some sort of site that I can pay a fee to get miners to send it through?
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:06:55
I'll have to check this out. Thank you for the help.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:33:17
How would the recipient go about doing that if the transaction hasn't gone through? That's what confuses me.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:18:31
I am using the latest Electrum. I think its dumb Electrum doesnt just set an automatic fee based on the value of the btc being transacted. Now as a result of Electrum's bad design choices, I have to wait for an unknown amount of time. Any idea how I can find out how long this will take to come through on the other end? The txid says that the transaction has been relayed. Shouldn't that mean the process will be over soon?
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:48:49
I think the debate was over whether btc from mining was taxable. But I see what you are saying thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:09:09
I recommend you reading what a fellow redditer has to say about holding: "Only 16 million currently exist, and only 21 million will ever exist. That is why people who have bought into this 'early' stand to make so much. They simply have to hodl until billions of people around the world have adopted the currency, like Facebook or cell phones. If you have 21 BTC, you hold 1 one-millionth of the entire BTC economy. Holding that percentage of an economy composed of what will be billions of people, is a very secure position."

True. Well thanks for answering my questions I was just curious 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:54:14
Based on Elliot wave theory it should retrace 50% from wherever it tops. It can't go up forever without a correction. And if it does go up forever without a correction, then it will be the first of its kind to do so.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:52:48
This is great

Lol when fiat dies and cryptos become world currencies you'll be sitting there on the shitter wishing u had bought. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:06:31
Literally just keep buying whenever u can and don't look at the price for 10 years. Have fun
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:56:45
After top we SHOULD see a 50% retrace, although, this is crypto after all..
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:37:29
When fiat money dies and Bitcoin becomes the world currency, im sure they won't be laughing. They'll be at your feet begging for you to feed them.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:21:56
So if you are just inefficiently mining of a CPU (which I'm not doing, just hypothetically) you can't add a confirmation to your tx? I know that miners prioritize txs by size of tx and fee, but are miners able to even specifically pick out one. Like what if a miners friend wants his tx confirmed fast, could that miner just find the tx and confirm it?
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:50:50
Buy bitcoin and just wait 10 years. Enjoy
