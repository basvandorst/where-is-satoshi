The fuck do you expect from 500.000 nerds in 1 subreddit
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:04:13
ow that is totally worth it hahah
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:13
Any reasons in particular? :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:10:19
I think it is! It just needs time i guess. They will change their minds when bitcoin is going to hit 25k hehe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:04:52
well did you need the car? in that case you couldn't do anything about it
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:05
Haha those were the times. Imagine that would happen now. A lot of new people would get heart attacks for sure xD
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:55:38
Looks good! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:50:14
I hope the same here dudes! May i ask with how much btc you guys hope to achieve this goal?
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:12:04
Thanks for the reaction! I will check out the youtube vids first. Are you a blockchain developer or you just want to learn it? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:18:20
i have never seen something eat walls like this dude.. wtf
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:22:05
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:58:55
When I am home i'll check it out! Why are The Netherlands bashing it so hard tho? What i have seen it is always so negative in the news. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:58
Any idea how we could reach them? We could do a signing thing. Just ask the whole community here xD
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:02:18
I think with the price and the futures coming it is a big chapter for the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:28:18
Btw bitcoins on a monitor..?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:47:17
Hahaha exactly my thoughts
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:49:51
4k a coin is already much imo hahah. HODLing is the best choice my friend. just be prepared for the moon :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:08
Ow intresting! I hope so :) rtl late night was alleen niet erg positief wat ik op facebook zag. NRC daarentegen een goed artikel met argumenten van beide kanten
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:21:29
it fucking scares me how it rips these walls wtf
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:38
Haha we will see my friend:). Another important question. When will bcash gain  without the pump and dumps of your lord and saviour roger ver ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:42:26
I totally agree with you. We need it right now with this hype
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:58:20
how much do you pay for that?? this is definitely the weirdest one yet
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:31:01
Kijk! Misschien een idee om een mail te sturen met wat handtekeningen? Ik zal eerst een mail sturen zonder anders. Ik ben benieuwd!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:15
What did you expect? Stable 20k? Ofcourse there was a correction. Nevertheless a gain of almost 3k in 24 hours. I remember when it was insane when bitcoin climbed 1k in 3 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:58:02
Bitcoin is rising like crazy. Yes it "crashed" at 19k but look at the bigger picture. A fucking gain of almost 3k in 24hours?? That is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:09:19
How can you even miss a dip like this
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:05:32
Okay. Give me a sec:
[ad link 1]( 
[link 2 rtl late night last person that will be on tv today](  (they called bitcoin a shady world and he will not be very positive about it tonight) 
[link 3 ad again]( 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:30:32
Yeah Emily is right again. Imagine having 152k bitcoins....
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:47:56
Mempool is decreasing, but you are right. Bitcoin has to action on the scaling problem. But is scaling up the best option? What is your opinion on this, and why?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:24:57
Hmmmm in that case i would wear the shirt but i wouldn't be in the club anymore :( doesn't sounds like a good deal to me..
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:23:53
Ow no sir. 21 million is the max that will ever be made of bitcoin. I own 1 btc now so that means i am 1 of the 21 million! :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:49:39
And b2x cancelled. This day is the best by far.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:39:15
My opinion. Sorry that we are not all that rich
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:20:50
Are you saying you can already sell b2x? I though we had to wait for the fork? I think i misunderstood?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:44:39
What does this new adjustment mechanism mean exactly? What will be different? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:39:33
Will a second pump be effective? All the weak hodlers already fucked up right? Could someone explain to me why this is a possibility
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:55:44
Hahah no i build up my saving from when i was 14 and never really bought anything. So this year i decided to buy some small amounts of btc til i had 1 :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:38:22
Okay. You know what happends when you lose your trezor for example? Is there anything you can do?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:16:26
Oow sorry I misunderstood! I have an offline paper wallet and reddit helped me out with it. Still planning to get a ledger though!
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:09:31
Okay. I am going to do some more research on lightning network. I have seen it passing by but haven't done any research. Thank you for the information! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:37:18
Bitcoin aims to mine a block every ten minutes. With a lot of miners mining bitcoin would mean that they accomplish mining a block already after 8 minutes. Bitcoin has an algorithm that increases and decreases the difficulty of mining a block. If it is 8 minutes the difficulty wil increase. If a coin is difficult to mine it is not really profitable. So miners flow out to an alt coin that is more profitable. This happend this weekend. A lot of miners left bitcoin for bitcoin cash cause it was more profitable. Difficulty changes when they reached an certain amount. I don't know exactly what the amount it but take for example that after every 10 block they change  difficulty. If the 10 blocks are mined in around 100 min, the difficulty will not really change. But in this case bitcoin cash mined like 40 blocks per hour. So they reached the x amount of blocks that has to be mined to change the difficulty. The algorithm checks the time and calculate the difficulty to get to that 10 min each block again. So imagine mining a block takes 9 min. And after 10 block they have done it in 90 min. The difficulty will increase so it will take the next 10 block 110 min so you even the time out, And stay on schedule. 
Please correct me if i made a mistake everyone. This is what i thought was the idea
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:07:11
My reaction maybe seem like i did not agree with you, but i do. health is the most important thing. If you are rich but have an uncurable decease you can't do shit with the money! Doesn't matter if you are rich or poor if you are death you end up the same way buried or burned.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:58:28
I heard GDAX is nice but not sure if that is possible with GBP. The prices are going down now btw maybe the correction will be soon and you can buy it for a nice price!
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:03:36
ye there is check out this website: 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:17:05
You still need help? Just send me a private message and you can ask everything you want!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:57:51
I just bought it small amounts at the time. I never bought things so i though you know what i can better put it in btc :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:36:13
You are gonna make some good money mate. roger Ver and the others just dumped their bch. The retarget is going to be in 9 hours or so. You are golden dude happy HODL:)
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:49:57
Gratz man!! Now HODL! :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:16:13
Yes exactly my thoughts. An option in the eyes of the 2x supporters was bigger blocks but that is just pushing the problem further the line in my opinion..
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:56:59
There will only be 21 million bitcoins in the world so this means there will never be more people than 21 million that own 1 btc :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:58:39
No i guess he split it up over a few addresses. Btw I am not even sure if this is confirmed? I'm going to do some research on that!
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:53:27
First of all 10k is a big investment. My opinion is first know bitcoin. Know what it is and how it works, cause it would be dumb to invest in something you don't even understand and know about. But i guess you already know a bit of bitcoin.
To be honest with you it is really hard to predict the market. When i bought amounts sometimes I just split it. 50% now and 50% later. That is how i was somehow satisfied no matter it went up or down. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:24:45
Also. Just the big events. I though this attack was a big thing or am I just talking bs here haha? I am not a veteran in bitcoin. Hopped in at 3600
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:11:41
Congrats man! And nothing is more impressive be proud of yourself. We are helping the evolution of money! I want that "Club 21M" shirt btw haha! Cheers and HODL mate!
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:00:04
That is a good question. I think you can't really find that out. Btw the adress with the most btc now has already 152.168 so 21 million people with 1 btc is not posible at all :P
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:19:51
Wow wtf.. the spanish inquisition is nothing compared to this!
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:47:18
Thanks dad! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:54:31
Don't wait too long! Just educate yourself, do some research and start with something small and HODL! :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:49:52
Thanks man :))
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:32:45
Hahaha i have it most of the time open on my second monitor... always a bad decision. Why did you choose a trezor btw? Any reasons? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:37:43
I hope it is a big catch :)! Goodluck
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:42:33
Yes it is I saw on a post that bitcoin was 2.81x more profitable. With the miners back we can get the big list of unconfirmed transactions away. This will still take hours but it already deceased with 10000
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:56:32
You are right man. I was proud of myself after finishing my 20 hours wank marathon in my dungeon.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:21:57
Okay that makes sense! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:34:07
Congratz mate! I made it to the club yesterday. Buckle up and HODL my friend :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:47:11
Oow okay! Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:00:27
Nice name
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:39:54
The subreddit needs to accept other opinions. But why do you think it will go back to 5000? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:39:25
Okay i will look it up. Thanks for all the help
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:39:57
Thank you for the reaction. I still have a question about getting my BTC offline.. i want to do it on a paper wallet but I am not sure how that is possible. Do i have to maken an account online or how does that work exactly? And is it possible that someone makes the same account like me? I don't fully understand how this all works.. maybe you could provide a legit article or video for it? I really appreciate the help :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:10:45
Wow those are some small numbers xD. So when i have done this. How can i check the balance of it? And should i throw away an adress after using it online once?
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:41:01
Okay thanks! So do you think i should wait with buying them or just do it? Will order a hardware wallet today! 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:56:11
I saw the paper wallet on youtube with bitaddress.org but I just don't understand the fact that you type random shit and nobody has the same public key? Is the chance that small to get the same public key? And if i have that public and private key and i transfer it to the public key. Am i able to check the balance somewhere? 
Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:00:34
Okay i think i get it now. Only thing i don't understand fully is the Syncing thing? What do you mean with that? Do i have to sync the adress?
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:19:48
Okay let's do this! Thanks for the advice
