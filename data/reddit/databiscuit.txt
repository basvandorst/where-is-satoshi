Did you even read the post? I explain that difficulty retargeting normally occurs every 2016 blocks (2 weeks @ 10 minutes/block), but if 99% of miners went offline within a few days of each other, then the time to the next difficulty retarget would balloon out to 39 years.

The price would plummet independent of the core developers actions - the fact that transactions would take 1 week to occur would be enough in itself.
A botched hard-fork, or hesitance of users to cede to it (out of personal interest, skepticism or ignorance), would also cause the price no doubt to plummet. The mere fact of this being required would not exactly inspire confidence - 'why wasn't this foreseen and per-empted in the first place'; 'what's to stop something like this from happening again?' Etc.
An example of how a hard-fork could easily be irreparably botched is in the initial days of getting up to speed with the new retarget. Imagine if something happens as with altcoins, where some guy mines thousands of coins within the first few minutes. There's a thousand things and more that could go wrong.

So what?
That graphs shows that there are periods recently in which the hash rate declined. If you look at the times of the difficulty retargets (they occur once every two weeks), you'll see that during twice of those this month, the hash rate and consequently difficulty dropped.
Scroll down and look at the 'difficulty history': 
The scenario I describe remains an eminent possibility and nothing you have said has diminished that

Another thing is that is it is already established that mining operators will turn off their machines.
This has already happened this month for example, where in two consecutive difficulty retargets (twice this month!), the total hash rate has dropped by a few few percent each time.

Over the past year the price has fallen by over 70%
It's not unreasonable to assume that the price could fall further, and anyone can look at the historical price chart of Bitcoin and see that there is no established support level between the current price and $120


It is reasonable to assume that when mining becomes unprofitable, to the point where electricity cost exceeds rewards, then some miners will turn off their machines and wait until the price goes back up before mining again. This creates a domino effect, whereby the reward rate is even further decreased for the remaining miners, making them too make the choice to turn off their machines until the next difficulty retarget.

I'm just presenting a possible scenario. It's worth considering because it poses a realistic existential threat to the Bitcoin scheme.
If the price *were* to go down to ~$120, Bitcoin could die (loss of confidence as protocol fails to function).

That's true, but leaving your machines on when you're making a net loss just on electricity usage wouldn't help you.
The rational decision (as has already been taken by some this month if you look at the total hash rate decreases), would be to switch off the machines and wait for either a) a higher price or/and b) the difficulty retarget


I know first-hand from my experience with mining altcoins in the past that when miners drop off, it decreases the profit for the remaining miners.
Say you've got 100 miners of equal hash rate working for a 25BTC reward once every 10 minutes. The price of 1BTC is $300. This means each miner gets a reward of **$75 per 10 minutes time**.
Now suppose the price drops to $120. 90 miners drop off. The 25BTC reward comes in 100 minutes time. This means that each of the remaining 10 miners gets a reward of 2.5BTC for 10 minutes work. That translates to 0.25BTC each for 10 minutes work. 0.25BTC x $120 = **$30 per 10 minutes time**.
This is the reason why the difficulty retarget exists, because otherwise the whole thing collapses in on itself without an external adjustment to stop it.


I wouldn't say a block time of 1 week is 'slightly longer'. Who will use Bitcoin or have confidence in it, when transactions are bottle-necked and take a minimum one week to send even with a fee for priority paid?

I think if the developers were going to release a hard fork, they would wait for consensus before releasing it. Supposing conensus is reached, and this new hard forked client is released, and turns out to be a botched idea that awards say thousands of Bitcoins in the initial ramping up of difficulty, then you would have some people going back to the old wallet, some people going forward with the new one, and others just looking on bereft of confidence and certainty.
Note that, and I think this is an incredibly important point, I don't even know if difficulty retargeting could be fixed with no dramas occurring. I've seen altcoins developers do it, and they've essentially just reset the difficulty back to 1 and hope there's no false starts when they shoot the starter gun.


My argument is that most miners would cease to mine at about the same time, because electricity costs globally are pretty similar. Keep in mind that in the situation I propose, the value of the machine is no longer a consideration - only the electricity cost, which would exist the rewards from running it. The hash rate or efficiency of the machine would make a negligible difference, since we are talking a few cents an hour here - but which nonetheless adds up to hundreds or thousands of dollars a year.
You'll note however that I do give some room for this factor, because I say it will take place over a number of days. It could be as long as almost a fortnight if you like, because that's the normal length of the retarget time. Even if there's only 1 normal day before the retarget left, if 99.9% miners left then that would balloon out to 2.78 years.


I do mention that 'enthusiasts' and 'Bitcoin holders' would continue to mine at a personal loss in the attempt to reach the difficulty retarget, but that this would be in vain.
I base this partly on my own experience with altcoins. I've seen this situation happen before, and a group of people tried concertedly to get it over the line, so to speak. In the end it wasn't enough though.
It's even worse for Bitcoin, because most miners are in it solely to make money - they're not kids with HD7970s willing to waste a handful of dollarydoos on something they like or believe in. I think a majority of miners would just accept the loss on their hardware, or even more likely, diversify into a SHA-256 alternative (perhaps the one that would replace Bitcoin as the most popular cryptocurrency).


The developers would be unlikely to issue a response until after the miners switch off their machines. The total hash rate has already dropped twice this month (two consecutive difficulty retargets downward), and yet what have the developers done about it? Are they even thinking about this kind of possibility right now? The fact that this post and my comments have been downvoted suggests that this is not a situation most Bitcoiners are even willing to consider as possible.

Your response is irrelevant to the point I was making, but fyi MtGox went into NEGATIVE figures during the 2011 crash (the MtGox system couldn't handle numbers under $0.01 or something like that)

You're right, I must have typed an extra digit into my calculation
Still, 16.66 hours is too long a time to solve a block, and that would make the time to the next difficulty retarget close to 4 years
Or to get the 166.66 hour figure, you could just make it 99.9% rather than 99% of miners

Let's see how it 'transforms this planet' when the network comes to a complete standstill and the currency dumped til the price goes to near zero
