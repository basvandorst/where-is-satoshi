How widely is Bitcoin used/accepted in Japan. I know it was made Legal Tender last April. I see many articles from last April and May saying how great it's going to be but I don't see anything current saying how it's going. I know Japan is responsible for about 30% of the global transactions but is that people investing or using it?

So I'm guessing that the same holds true for the change. Thanks.

I hold BTC but I see things a little differently. Addressing your points above,
1.    No one will be stopping any governments over bitcoin. The government controls the points at which fiat/bitcoin are exchanged, unless you buy on the street. If they had even the slightest concern that btc was going to upset the monetary system, they would freeze bank accounts the send/receive money from crypto exchanges, ban crypto exchanges and prohibit any buying/selling crypto by citizens. Think they can't? In case you hadn't noticed, the govenment tells us how things are going to be and not the other way around. 60-65% of people when asked didn't want the new US Tax bill. It was passed anyway. 70-75% of people in the US when asked say weed should be legal but unless something has changed since I started typing this, it isn't. Bitcoin isn't going to disrupt any currency systems. Take Japan for instance. Last April the goverment in Japan declared Bitcoin to be Legal Tender. It's real money there. It's also now subject to all the laws regarding what you can and can't do with money. This is most likely the path that will be taken with the digitization of money globally. The people holding the $Trillions$ aren't giving that up *any* time soon.
2. When I say nobody/everybody here I mean about 98% of the people in the US. Nobody cares about seeds of intellectualism. Hardly anyone can see the beauty in Mathematics. Nobody cares why money works. Nobody wants to be educated about the Fractional Banking system, Central banks, or the money supply. Everybody cares about getting money by working or investing, having money and spending money, to live or for lulz. With a little reading about the tax plan I was able to learn that about $1.2 Trillion dollars will be repatriated from abroad by corporations and about half of that will be distributed to shareholders in the form of buybacks. Shareholders? Oh that's right. 80% of the shares of stock in the US are held by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. US corporations will reap a windfall from the lowering of the corporate tax rate. Many have stated that that money will go into...buybacks. When I talk to people about this it pisses them off. What are they going to do about it? *Nothing*. They can't. They have families to provide for, homes to maintain, jobs to keep and a myriad of other concerns. Most people are working hard at holding together the stuff that keeps the people they love safe and happy to whatever degree they can be. Besides, when we come home from work, we're tired.
3. This one is a new feature of magical Internet money for me. By virtue of having bought bitcoin I no longer have to work? Did I miss an email from coinbase or my current employer letting me know this? There is a very small group of people that bought btc because of a dream 1,2,5 years ago and have done really well. Pay for a house, start a business, retire young, buy a Lambo and do other things that make them happy. I love seeing that. I love to see smart, idealistic people young and not so hitting the lottery not because their number was pulled out a jar but because of a well reasoned decision they made and believed in. This is a good thing. But. I'm not sure why you think up to 50% of Americans will be quitting their day jobs because they have bitcoin. If you think about bitcoin as money, think about this. In general, money is hard to get. All money. No one will be paying me to stay home and post on reddit, however nice that might be. In addition as I alluded to above, people already know they're being screwed left right and center. They can't do anything about it so they try their best to work around it and try to do what's best for themselves and their families.
Something you said is a peeve of mine. "every stupid voter's voice still counts". I had this discussion with a guy running for state office on election night. He said essentially the same thing. I told him that thinking that people that vote for the other party are stupid is an unhelpful position. I encourage everyone to vote. I tell them I'd like it if they vote my way, but that's it's more important to me that they just vote. A lot of people voted in favor of the current mess we're in because they're  desperate, not stupid.  They think they've done everything they can the right way, hold a job, work hard, not a criminal, try to raise a nice family but they struggle to get by. They have trouble making rent, they're always trying to keep some old car running "one more year" and their kids don't have the nicest clothes. They are desperate for a change. They look at TV at night and see how nice other people have it and they look around and see that they don't have jack no matter how hard they try. Somebody, a political party, needs to talk to these people, find out what their beef is and start helping them out of the hole they're in. The current government seems to have made a lot of promises but just fill the heads of these people with hate. These people are crying out for help. If this administration crashes without helping them, and it might, you might see the revolution you talk about. It won't be over bitcoin or the international  banking system, it's going to be about "why has the system in this nation  failed me, my family and my friends?" "Why can't I get ahead but other people do." It might involve weapons, it would be very ugly and I would really like for that not to happen. So I don't think of people as stupid. I know intelligence is a spectrum and some people know more than I do and some people know less.  However, I believe that people who will never know enough to program a computer or run a bank should still be compensated in a way that they can also be proud of providing their families a good life in a nice home without having to worry about what bill isn't getting paid this month. They spend just as much time from the only life they'll ever have as I do. They shouldn't have to suffer. 
As long as I'm down here, I'll give you "boo_radley's $5 Bitcoin Theory". No, I'll never see a $5 Bitcoin, at least I hope not. Nor do I have any, but I'm really happy for the people that do and I hope they have stacks of them and that they use them to being themselves and others joy. So here's my theory. New technologies succeed when they are better and/or easier to use. Better could be better for the task at hand or more fun to use. Easier could be modulated to "not harder".  When talking about bitcoin, I apply the constrains I mentioned above like the government will control it to some degree, it will be taxed and all of the rules currently applied to money will apply to bitcoin. "But that goes against decentralization and takes control out of the hands of the people." Yup it sure does and if people can't get over this then the digitalization of money might be called FedCoin or DollarCoin. So. I go into a convenience store now and grab something for $4.50. I get in line at the checkout. I scrounge around in my pocket for that crumpled up $5 bill. I straighten it out, make sure Abe's picture is on it and check that there arent't any goobers on it and then I read the headlines on the magazines in the checkout racks and listen to some music. When I get up to the cash register I take off my headphones, chat with the guy about how much working sucks and we really hope it doesn't snow 8 inches tonight. He scans the item, I check that I got the sale price, he bags it and hands me the change. I look at the change or sometimes don't even if it's less than a buck and drop it in my pocket. "Have a good  day. See ya." During this transaction I never thought about money other than if the price rang up properly. I didn't need to wonder if .00032051 is a good price for what I bought or if the exchange rate they use is correct. I just used a 5. It's a means to an end. When bitcoin can be used like that, many people will want it. Mass acceptance will come. Denominations will need to change, nobody is going to use money that is denominated in an 8 digit decimal. Perhaps you will never see bitcoin, it will be managed on your trezor, phone or watch and still show the denomination of the country you may live in. People already understand their currency as it relates to buying and selling stuff. No more checks. Credit will likely persist, we're pretty addicted to it. I know no one wants government control, but boo_radley thinks that's what will happen. I hope it's Bitcoin, I really do. I'm an old geek, I think the technology is astonishing, I think the community contains a lot of brilliant minds and I own some, so there's that. Haha. I've been involved in radical movements in the past. Don't pin your hopes on quick radical change. Life is compromise. You give a little and you get a little. Radical change comes slowly over time. We all need to be careful that we don't screw the pooch here. Destabilizing the global monetary system, as much as we might hate it and what it does to people, can only result in more suffering and pain that no one needs. Incremental change, destroy from within, take 10-15 years. Our grandchildren with thank us. And when we're doing it right, everyone will be dancing. Right?
Happy New Year everyone. We have to work on making it better for everyone.

You say you can't get back in because the price is too high. Last time I checked, $100 worth still costs $100.

I had bought some altcoin recently. I was perusing its blockchain and pointed out some interesting activity on a forum. Some folks there suggested that I was creepy for doing that and I was asked if I didn't have anything better to do with my time.

64 years old here. Started using bitcoin for various purpose two years ago. About 3 months ago I decided to start converting under performing mutual funds into BTC. A few moments ago I saw BTC breach $4000 at coindesk. I think I've finally done something right. :)

@_date: 2017-08-13 02:08:30
We don't, but that's not the point. Today is about dreaming. Like when you buy that $300 million lottery ticket and dream about what you're going to do with all that money, until they don't pull your number again. It could be trading for $400 in 3 days. But until then we dream.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:22:51
We could form an investment club. Instead of picking what to buy, we'd pick when to buy. We could call it the Baby Boomers Bitcoin Buying Society (BBBBS). In a few years the younguns could be complaining that the boomers won't give up the good jobs AND they're hoarding all the BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-26 17:17:23
That's interesting. That also explains other purchase of 6 cents and 10 cents I've seen made over periods of 30 seconds or a minute from time to time. I spend WAY too much time staring at GDAX but I've always been fascinated watching numbers/things change on a screen. I used to enjoy watching disks being defragged fer instance. Pathetic, I know.

Would I just do a normal transaction and send the btc from electrum to a receive address on the trezor and pay a fee?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:27:22
Just like we laugh at the suckers who think they have $12000 because they own some shares of Apple or some mutual fund or any other investment. But for the moment, I can turn my bitcoin into $10.4K on gdax in about 2 seconds.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:46:15
You can set up a recurring transaction at Coinbase, but the fees are pretty high.

So it appears that there are three kinds of people here tonight. People who are happy they bought bitcoin, people that are sad/upset that they never bought bitcoin and the third set of people, those that are here to find "the guy" who is going to 'cut his balls off'/'eat his balls'/'cut off his dick'/'eat his dick'. This is why I love reddit.

It looks like you can. But again, you pay a premium price.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:33:57
Also the Coinbase dashboard price is about $100 less than GDAX. It's usually exactly the same. Hmmm.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:21:33
Someone dropped 500 BTC in the ask queue on GDAX at 7AM EDT today. Put them in, took them out. Split them into two 250 BTC lots, in and out. Sometimes only 250, sometimes 500. At $6600, that was $3.3 million. Which one of you guys is cashing out? :)

@_date: 2017-11-26 18:19:44
I've been watching since yesterday too. Someone slurped up about 100 BTC around 9300. That's nearly $1 Million. Who are these people?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:35:43
Neat idea. Out of curiosity, how does a blind person obtain BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:16:53
And when it hit $7k on GDAX, there was a buy of 150 BTC. $1 million. This is some serious shit here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:15:46
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:16:01

Why don't you go hang out on r/BitcoinDiscussion if you want to be all serious and shit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:10:25
Right, but you can't set up recurring transactions on GDAX. Or am I wrong? OP wants to set up an automatic buy like a mutual fund.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:21:52
Also remember that the minimum wage workers in the photo were being paid $1.60/hr.

Hahaha. Old timer here. Excuse me while I wipe the spittle off my chin. There. I move USD into my bitcoin account at coinbase. I move that bitcoin into a local wallet and various exchange wallets where I trade shitcoins for fun and profit. Move money around on the Ripple network. Trade on forex. Did you know that Forex is the worlds largest decentralized market and that 5 TRILLION dollars USD are traded everyday? Have you younguns come up with anything near that scale yet? Bitcoin is hard to use. Electrum comes up and gives you a dozen word seed phrase so you can recover your 8000 bitcoin if your wallet gets lost. Don't forget to copy your wallet to at least three different disks so you don't lose it. I buy things with and donate bitcoins. Why is it always quoted in USD and BTC? Because people don't really know the value of .00675354 BTC? Face it. When BTC is easier to use than my CC on my Prime account, people will start to use it. Any new tech has to be faster, better, easier to be accepted. Where do I keep my retirement fund and get interest on it? Do you think people want to manage hundreds of thousands of dollars themselves on Seagate drives and usb sticks? Oh, that's right. I can store it safely on the next Mt Gox. At best, bitcoin or something like it will become the medium by which funds are transmitted between banks and countries because it's much faster than what is used now. You'll have to excuse me now, I have to go finish my Geritol and change my diaper. Fucktards.
