Just signed up for the current class. If any group is formed, be sure to inform me please!

Apparently all you guys defending XAPO didn't see the part where they said there would be no fees..
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:32:37
Will they be pursuing a production ready, functions version or are we going to have to wait till someone decides to use the source code?
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:11:21
Did you even read his comment? Come on man..

In the Bloackchain 2.0 article it said that Austin Hill invested $4 million in the 90s on zero knowledge. I'm guessing he still has a good amount of money.
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:01:59
He's one of the devs...
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:03:16
That's the exact same thing with Petamine

You're just being ignorant at this point. You obviously haven't found real hip hop music that talks about the struggles of their lives and others. There's no point in arguing with you if you're just going to make generalizations due to the limited spectrum you have listened to.

Not sure if you're still doing this but I made this tool here 
It's fairly simple but I couldn't find any other solutions that were made at the time.
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:14:58
Was wondering the same thing. Was anxiously waiting for their service to become available in my region, now I don't really have an interest anymore because of this.
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:56:32
I sure as hell hope not. Netflix's current model works very well IMO and switching to a PPV model won't make them stand out as from the competition as much.

Unrelated to the OP, but can you tell me how trustworthy cointrader is? I haven't heard as much about them as other exchanges, and they are one of the only exchanges I've seen that allow wire transfers without verification.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:48:34
No, people just don't listen when warnings have been issued months in advance.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:58:36
I want to switch to them but they don't have their license in my state :(
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:07:43
Is there anyway to turn off those privacy invading features? Also is Ubuntu server affected
@_date: 2014-03-24 10:54:46
Now they need to let me use their service

Download a wallet and send the funds to an address in the wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-28 10:37:14
Why not? Btc-e has, from what I've seen, been one of the most reliable exchanges as of yet. Yeah they're shady but that also means you don't need to give them extensive documentation to receive your funds.
@_date: 2014-03-16 15:52:12
A multisig address (2 of 3 in this case) is created by using the public keys of 3 different addresses. A new address will created starting with a 3, that is the multisig address. Any funds that are spent from it require 2 of the 3 addresses to sign it (in order to sign from an address, one must be in control of it aka have it's private key).
This is useful for escrow services. Here's an example: Say Alice wants to sell Bob a banana for bitcoins. They want to ensure that both of them have protection from scamming the other, so they call their friend Charlie to use as escrow. They create a multisig address with 1 key from each of them. Now 2 things can happen:
1) Alice send Bob the banana, and Bob confirms that he got it. Alice and Bob sign the transaction, so Charlie ended up not having to do anything
2) There is a dispute between Alice and Bob, so both are wanting the Bitcoins held in escrow. Charlie then must decide who he believes is right, and once doing so will sign the transaction that sends the funds to its rightful owner.
I hope this helped even though it wasn't a video lol

True, but I think this is going in a good direction. Dev may possibly add?
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:14:12
It did, this post is 17 days old.
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:17:29
Yeah it's not like they claimed there wouldn't be any fees or anything...
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:01:15
A wallet that runs client side (besides connecting to a server, which you can run yourself, to push transactions, load the blockchain, etc) that focuses on making it easier to stay anonymous with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:07:01
And this is why I didn't understand people supporting this guy..
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:33:33
I will definitely check that out, thanks for working on this - I find this key to the bitcoin ecosystem and our society in general.
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:39:31
You're comparing operating large machinery that could easily kill people to ridiculous regulations on businesses that bring products/services.
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:05:37
Then make your own called FreeMarket. They're just forking the code, DarkMarket is still called DarkMarket.

The fact that you post things like that show how this place has devolved. You assume that all "rappers" are unintelligent, when I'd bet a good sum of money many of them are smarter than you. You clearly either don't understand the amount of time and work it takes to produce music or have a very narrow view on what you define as intelligent.
Also, Rap genius isn't limited just to rap, in case you didn't know. It now goes by "Genius"

Very true, we'll have to see what Kraken does in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:36:05
Why don't people use them more? There isn't a downside, right?
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:30:21
I used cointrader.net
They're based in Canada, I'll send them a bank deposit with my account  The only problem is it took me about 2 weeks to receive my funds - but that could be due to the fact that I was mailing from the US. They also accept wire transfers, but my bank charges $40.
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:35:54
As long as the key you used for encryption is strong is should be fine to send. Some people upload their encrypted private keys on dropbox in case of a house fire or some similar situation.

I just simply don't care about nascar, not sure how that makes me a pretentious prick.

It's not a premine because Bitcoin was publicly released but Satoshi was the only one mining. You're comparing two completely different things..

What is the problem if the power goes out?

Go to your wallet and in the top right there is a "pay" button
@_date: 2014-07-20 14:16:38
Eventually yes but I'm pretty sure Satoshi mined by himself for almost a year.

On their wiki it says the estimated times they expect to come out with other alpha releases and into beta, I'm currently on mobile so I cannot link to it for you. However I believe they are supposed to be coming out of beta fairly soon, most stuff just needs hardened out.

Interesting. And a color can be assigned to any coin regardless of its amount? (Such as a 0.0373 coin)
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:25:54
So if I received 1"colored" bitcoin that coin could be worth more than just 1 bitcoin?
