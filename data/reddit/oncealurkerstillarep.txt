Never dealt with them, but thanks for the link to bitporium.  May buy another gfx card from them.

get an ATI card?

Nope, not to late with the price of BTC vs USD going up at the rate it does.  And if the market crashes you still have hardware you can sell.  I am pulling in ~$600 usd with 3 5770's.
*Ninja (albiet a slow one) edit:  ~$600 per month

Will do.  Doesn't look like they have poker yet though.

I have already taken home $150 in cash, $65 went to pay off one of the 5770.  The other $150 is sitting in bitcoins.
