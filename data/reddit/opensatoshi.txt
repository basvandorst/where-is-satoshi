The amount of media attention bitcoin is getting is almost unbelievable. It seems like you can't go anywhere without seeing multiple references per week by brand name media outlets.
I still remember the shock of seeing the first mentions in the mainstream press.

Bitcoin transactions can send funds to multiple "outputs" (addresses). I believe you'd specify the (new) paper wallet address you want the change to go to at the same time you spend your bitcoin.
Programs are supposed to generate a change address for you (or send change back to the original wallet), so this only really becomes an issue if you import a paper wallet's private key into one of these programs - and then wipe the installation thinking your paper wallet automatically contains the change.

Take a look at the sharp differences of opinion on this Reddit thread to see just how hard it will be to change anything about the structure of the block chain:
Although the growing size of the block chain is an issue, the hard limit on the size of each block (1 MB, it seems) should also be considered. If the number of transactions that need to be processed exceeds the capacity to store them all in one block block, then the speed of transaction processing could begin to slow down. A block is only mined every 10 minutes or so, so if the rate of new transactions exceeds the storage capacity for one block, transactions will start to pile up.
The debates on what to do about this remind me a little of the [Cross of Gold]( debate from the 1800s.
Edit: There's a pretty interesting website that talks about this: [keepbitcoinfree.org](

US bitcoin exchanges need to conform to [Know Your Customer]( anti-money laundering regulations and that's why they'll all need to know your personal info.

Nifty idea.
How does scanning the "Scan the QR code to pay" QR code actually start a transaction?
Is the mechanism dependent on the user having a particular client installed on their device?

Bitcoin transactions can contain messages. The [first transaction]( is a 50 BTC mining reward to Satoshi in which he embedded the message:

This is the problem that [Bitrated]( solves. It's a new way to discourage online fraud and encourage trust between two parties that don't trust each other.
It uses a latent feature of bitcoin called [m of n transactions](

I'm not 100% sure, but it seems that more nodes should mean more capacity to receive and process transactions.
The bigger problem could be the [block size cap]( If so many transactions are flooding the network that every block hits the block size limit, users might see a slowdown in transaction processing times.
In that case, the only option to speed up processing times would be to raise the cap, although it might be hard to forge a consensus on the new limit.

No biggie - I hadn't seen this approach before and was just curious if you had something specific in mind.
The bowls actually look really nice, and I'm really interested in how many people are starting to offer hand-crafted items for bitcoin.
Not sure if this is up you're alley, but you might try setting up a landing page to gauge interest better. [Unbounce]( works pretty well. [Check this out]( The guy is not a programmer but was able to stitch some low-cost services together to sell his product online. The payment system was not bitcoin, but you might be able to swap that out with [coinbase]( or similar.

I suspect that transaction fees would need to increase. You can already see this happening with transactions lacking a fee taking much longer than those with a fee.
Increased fees will attract more miners, which will produce overcapacity. The overcapacity will drive down mining profits (and fees). The cycle would then repeat.
Eventually the network would agree on a "fair" transaction fee.

[Read this first]( before making any transfers out of a paper wallet.
This is non-intuitive stuff that has burned many new users.
To answer your question, yes, it's considered good practice to move your change into a new wallet. BIP38 seems like a really useful idea, but I'm not sure how much I'd rely on it just yet to safeguard significant sums of bitcoin.

This might not fit with what you're after, but have you thought about bitcoin-themed jewelry? Necklaces and earrings, mainly. Use the increasingly-famous Bitcoin currency symbol as a starting point.
To test out the idea, make a few castings, take some pictures, and throw up a website using something like [Unbounce]( puts some prices up there, post to this subreddit again with a link to your page, and see what happens.
The problem with QR codes, is that they're more or less disposable - they're not like your website URL, for example. QR codes have also been abused by noobs for hawking all manner of junk and are everywhere, so the link to bitcoin is weak.

It's inevitable that governments will eventually see the threat that bitcoin poses to their monopoly of currency. When they do, they will act. I'm not sure that makes them evil - they're just trying to protect their turf against an upstart.
The smart ones will figure out quickly that this is a losing battle.

It's amazing how many new bitcoiners have made no major prior investments.
Dollar-cost averaging is a good idea for savers.
Bitcoin also has some amazing features that are ready to use, but not widely known or supported in software. These features could make it possible to do entirely new kinds of investments on the bitcoin network. See, for example:

There are many directions this could go - futures market, insurance policies, various kinds of financial derivatives.
You could even have this hooked up to [Contracts]( (m of n transactions) with a mediator to resolve disputes.
