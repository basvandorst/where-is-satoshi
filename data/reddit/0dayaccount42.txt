Coinomi has full segwit support and is on iOS

Perhaps use [this website]( to convert your address to the legacy format?
I use it all the time and know for a fact it works between cashaddr and legacy, but you can try with a small amount first.

Coinomi has full segwit support, bech32 sending and receiving

How do you do that? I started doing some freelancing and Paypal snatched f*ing 7,8% of my payment! Is it only via the app? Do you have to register your friends somehow?
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:26:37
I really like [this website]( for fee estimation. You get to see exactly which fee levels are being cleared, updated to the minute

Does this mean it doesn't happen in Bitcoin's chain? I'll do the same check, but I'm still very curious about how it could happen anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:58:41
But it looks like I messed up. Though I double checked at first, the triple check didn't show anything unusual. Probably the rows got misaligned when merging, and showed the wrong miner for the address.
Sorry for the confusion, but, of course, anyone is welcome to check =)
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:14:41
Thanks, posted there as well. But as I replied to huca89, did anyone ever take a look at this in Bitcoin's chain? Is it normal behavior? Doesn't anyone think it's weird?

But this can be detected. If none of the transactions were in "the mempool" when the block was mined, it means they weren't broadcast, so they are most likely sent to themselves. If the transactions were in "the mempool", the miner would risk those transactions being picked up by another miner and having to pay for the fees.

It's not even a question of converting more than 50% of dealers to use the new rules. It will be a new game. I have my own table, if anyone comes playing eqleriq-poker, they're gonna get kicked outta the table.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:12:03
Sorry but I didn't quite get what you mean...
By "use the mined fees" you mean from the coinbase transaction? So the miner would collect some fees and immediately spend them back to themselves?
But wouldn't these transactions also have fees of their own? If picked up by another miner, the malicious miner would have to pay them. Also, coinbase transactions need to reach maturity before being spent.

The core wallet allows importing individual private keys. What I would personally do is get the private key of each of your addresses using  import them into core, and make a single transaction sending all funds to an address of the seed you want to keep.
The fee savings are greater when you are sending "one to many", but you can save a few bytes when sending "many to one" instead of 3 individual txs.

If only they were honest about this being an advertisement. I mean, it's painfully obvious, but they still go for the "I'm just a normal guy writing about this card".
That and other obvious scripted "conversations" I've seen on other posts around here about paying for stuff on crypto. Someone replies with a vague mention of this card. Someone else sends a "uh, what is that?". "Oh, you don't know? It's this card thing that I just got, it's super cool, yadda yadda". "Wow, looks amazing, what else?", and they continue this pathetic back and forth hoping people will believe it's just two noob accounts that happened to bump into each other. It just makes the entire project look bad.

Mycelium doesn't transparently convert from one to another. It derives its bech32 address using the M/84' path, and the P2SH wrapped addresses using the M/49' path. It keeps the address list of each path separately and let's you switch from one to the other transparently. You can check for yourself with  Of course you *can* convert from one to the other. But no wallet that's worth a damn should do it.
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:05:53
Proper wallets would use a different derivation path for each address type: M/49'/0'... for the ypub and M/84'/0'... for the zpub. It's not possible to convert from one to the other or determine any kind of relationship between the two, just like it's not possible to determine relationships between accounts 0 and 1.

I use them weekly with lightning and it's awesome.

The checksum is as random as the rest of the address. Let's say your malware is "smart" and you have a list of pre-generated addresses so that you replace an address on the clipboard with a malicious one with the same first 10 characters. Generating such "vanity addresses" has the same difficulty as making one with the same first-5-and-last-5 digits.
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:17:59
Yes and no. The checksum is encoded in the last word, but it's not the full word. Every word carries 11 bits of information. For 24 words the last 8 bits are the checksum, so the last word contains 3 bits of the seed as well. A mnemonic composed of 3 words only has a checksum of 1 bit. So yes, you can't choose any random word from the list, not all combinations are valid, but there are still multiple valid options for the last word. And you'll still have to check the validity somehow if you are bruteforcing anything.
@_date: 2019-12-24 06:33:28
That's right if you have the first 23 words, you have 23*11=253 bits of the seed. The last word has the last 3 bits, so that's exactly 8 possible combinations.
One way is to bruteforce and try every possible word to see if the rest of the bits of the word happen to be the correct checksum.
Another way is to simply make all 8 possible combinations of the last bits, calculate the checksum for the entire seed, and see which are the resulting words (you treat the last 11 bits as a number between 0 and 2047, and get the corresponding word from the bip39 word list)

True. You'd expect everyone checks the rates before every purchase and every exchange, but many don't... What's important is that the info is right there, Bitrefill isn't hiding anything.
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:03:19
The better rule is: always try receiving in a "bc1" address first, everywhere. If service doing the sending doesn't support it, it will say so, then you use a "3" address.
If you are doing the sending, it doesn't matter if you are sending from bc1, 3, 1, or any mix of those. The receiver will receive the coins either way.

Coinomi is super simple to use but also has some serious power-user and security options. They say they plan to add support to LN too. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:04:26
We all know the value is way, way, **WAY** higher than 4800... Just nobody wants to be the first one to pay it
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:03:48
I really like [Coinomi]( you can use any address type if your exchange doesn't support bech32 yet (by default bech32 is used, change also goes to bech32 addresses)
@_date: 2018-07-16 03:42:01
You say you tested the app first, then created a new "for reals" wallet+passphrase. Are you sure you are using the "for reals" phrase, not the test one?
You can use your passphrase on Ian's tool here [ and verify if the addresses created there are the same as the ones showing in Jaxx right now. If they are, you probably have the wrong phrase...
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:00:48
I think [coinomi]( is awesome, it's for iOS and Android

I've never used  but they accept crypto. Anyone here ever booked anything with them that can share the experience?
cheapair.com is only for flights, but I did book with them once and it worked OK.

7- actually there are a number of words that look or sound similar. From the top of the list it's easy to find "aware" and "awake".
