bitcoin.com may be one of the shittiest websites ive seen
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:38:11
how did you obtain this username.
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:42:59
Say hi from my part
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:40:40
have you seen ? its just a mirrored version... 
"big blocks 4 lyf!!!"
"satoshi's vision!!"
"lmaoo look at bitcoin's mempool!! xdd"
"this post is amazing $100000"
"omg I got censored on part 34"
"cashenning!!11 xd"
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:51:55
eks deee
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:04:03
except you did it 11 years ago :D
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:06:18
haha well atleast we know you don't own a "small amount"
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:40:27
lmfao... "10k bitcoin meth is now worth millions" sounds indeed like ass
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:01:45
lol yeah my exact thought, a train on fire might look bad ass but it can literally derail at any time

@_date: 2017-12-25 21:52:28
as someone relatively new to crypto, I find laughable that a coin appeared on the top 3 of CMC overnight. Bitcoin Cash is an okay coin I guess, but the community is cancer. And.... Bitcoin Cash is treated as some revolutionary coin when there are far better ones that didn't have to steal a brand
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:51:57
you just told us you have a shitton of btc
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:56:49
I designed them myself :D
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:20:44
Seriously, why does this sub need so many twitter posts, and everyone on twitter uses the most average profile pic ever lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:08:00
im just curious how you did it
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:17:05
Is that a compliment? Haha. Thats the exact look I was trying to achieve
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:31:56
how much would this operation reward you?

i'm not holding any btc rn but holy shit, congrats
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:57:56
You can rewind the video if you want, when the stream ends, it will be archived.
This guy heard about BTC in 2009 and invested in 2010, he says it at the start so I think its interesting to hear what he's saying - cheers :D
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:44:45
So you now have 50 btc? What the fuck
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:58:14
Guess what, not everyone has the same life as you
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:47:02
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:53:53
is no one gonna mention he has the Lamborghini dealership open?
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:00:50
posted this and got ignored.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:45:45
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:57:20
he meant that the blue color is raping his eyes
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:15:10
That bitcoin is slow and expensive
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:47:42
why would it be bad?
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:03:07
gotcha, but let's say you put in $500, wouldn't it be lost after thousands of transaction fees!?
@_date: 2017-09-24 07:06:20
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:37:18
What did a bitcoin mixer exactly do?

@_date: 2018-02-08 08:15:20
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:27:30
But what does BCH do specifically to clog Bitcoin? just make a bunch of random tx's? Isn't that just a waste of time/money?
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:26:41
Well I don't live in the US, my exchange is not very known either. I can't choose the fee from my exchange to my wallet and the fee was expensive, whats so hard to understand? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:19:41
where would you post it if you made one?
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:30:45
 rip
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:07:04
Thats true, my exchange does not handle bitcoin very well from what I see :/
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:37:18
What did a bitcoin mixer exactly do?
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:31:50
So the transaction fee of 0.001 was my governments fault..?
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:21:08
I don't have an agenda. I like to diversify and I pointed out how inefective bitcoin felt, have you tried other coins mate?
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:33:45
Yeah, learned my lesson. It wasn't with a credit card tho.. It's worth saving up a bit more and then buying or this happens
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:23:45
Anyone know if theres an estimated number of crypto users? Or people who have heard about BTC? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:05:22
fo real tho
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:08:15
When i'm older and I have a business I will not need to convert to fiat
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:01:16
u gonna keep smoking? lol
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:57:12
Yesterday I bought btc and nbox. I may be buying more... check out unboxed network, worth a chance! 
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:36:07
so you have tried other coins and came to the conclusion that Bitcoin is the absolute best crypto coin on earth?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:51:26
The currency that went from $1000 to $5800 in a year, indeed perfect for my business lol
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:14:53
I know, I own other coins, but after months of having 0btc I was like, why not? Its a small amount but not cool. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:23:30
I'll soon buy more bitcoin :D and maybe also some Unboxed. buy buy buy!
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:40:42
Prices on the floor right now, what the actual hell - also, opinions on ICOs? I'm looking at Unboxed and seems solid to me
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:36:32
Will buy some more NBOX and bitcoin soon, wish me luck
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:54:11
Anyone here into ICOs? i'm looking into Unboxed Network but i'd like some opinions first
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:18:54

@_date: 2017-05-25 22:32:32
Yup, I think i'll go with coinmama
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:33:36
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:22:15
An exchange account like Coinmama for example? I'm not from the US.

@_date: 2017-06-09 21:15:24

@_date: 2017-06-06 04:23:35
ads? when was the last update?
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:52:59
Mycelium imo
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:08:49
Yeah, I checked the 4 addresses and none have a balance. Aren't there more addresses? I have no experience with Bicoin Core. Can't you export the Public and private keys? Where are you trying to send them?
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:13:10
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:56:33
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:30:35
Yeah honestly its just better to download and edit it, just in case lol
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:48:48
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:34:30
Oh thanks yeah im kinda familiar with TOR... sooo this guy doesnt have much chance does he? : (
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:25:05

@_date: 2017-06-09 20:54:22

@_date: 2017-06-06 05:16:31
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:31:57

@_date: 2017-06-08 08:51:49
