This is gonna be demoralizing at Day 100. I propose a no tx day movement, let the spammers pay. We need to fight back.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:59:41
it wont merged to core. core is protocol base layer, they probably like to keep this separate. other implementation client might.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:31:42
I think there a bit of exaggeration here and maybe double counting. if i made a tx to a business/individual, it one same tx for both parties. layer 2 is definitely needed, we dont need to over justify.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:41:43
i'm just stating that if i made 448 txs with you, we cannot count it as 896 txs made.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:18:12
What % of txs in this world need the luxury of immutablity? we dont need everything on the blockchain and certainly dont need to have everything on one single blockchain.  which is the reason, im open to all scaling solution.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:19:30
these are not spam. you want to see obvious spam. those low fee sudden bumps are spams.

It's data from one farm. And one of the more profitable ones. So it doesn't means the cost is average among the whole mining industry. 
And if you read into their depreciation report, they(hut8) is underwater.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:28
Reason for some urgency in this is not due to the price correction. Certainty because of what we can already seeing in the fees. And yes mempool can clear and clog back. In the meantime, we can keep boasting about how bitcoin is a use case for Venezuelans while they have to wait for the mempool to clear to buy dinner.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:56
It's not about patient. At 1mb, it's too cheap and effective to spam/flood attack the network.  When layer 2 is released, adoption will slow to a crawl like in segwit. Who could afford $100 to open/close a LN channel? Most use case would be priced out. Layer 1 would be the bottleneck. These attacks have been going on for years and we shouldn't underestimate the determination of these crooks.
Not solving this problem is like saying this problem exist because bitcoin is too popular, we just have to lose popularity and become a ghost town network. Problem solved.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:52:10
Then you are a noob that is overpaying for 2.5years and don't know how to adjust your own tx fees.  You can't do those type of low fee tx(&lt;0.00001) anymore the mempool will timeout. Please educate yourself.
Start here.

Don't move just to be on segwit. Move it when you need to, you dont want to be the one causing congestion.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:32:36
I don't see this as temporarily. These bad actors now have more incentive to kill Bitcoin than to see it succeed. I can see determination to cripple the network for decades. Intentional blockage is real thing. 
It's not about block size now. It's about the willingness to hardfork and show push back capabilities. If we are so afraid of a hardfork, than it undermine the ideal of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:08:27
It's time for us to stop focusing on this guy and move on. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:35:41
Not so fast. The biggest weakness of bitcoin is spam. At current rate, even layer 2 will be priced out. And I'm not so sure the attackers have stepped fully on the gas.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:33:56
The amount of BS here is not any less than r/btc. But at least people here call them out.

@_date: 2017-08-25 02:09:07
We gave up micro transaction, so tell me. Are $10-20 transaction micro? And what's the fee? 10%? The bitcoin user experience is awful at this point of time. Still better than banks and remittance services you say? Open your eyes people(especially core Devs). The legacy system are improving, dozen of fintech are popping up. Sure there are spamming you say, but go look at the mempool, even without the spam the demand for space is crazy.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:26:09
blocks are slow man. math is too hard.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:38:43
The question should be will the mempool reduce to a healthy level. Which I doubt so even if we reach full segwitTX usage. Adoption is too far ahead now. I do not see lightning helping anytime soon. 
Core should do their own implementation of 2x. The "It's too dangerous too hardfork" agurement is not valid now, since there will be one coming irregardless. If core does not want bitcoin to be hijacked from them, they should play the cards right.

Very good read. This time round, bch all iners are not getting free money, so I suspect it might not do as well as you said. Bch is an insurance for jihan and gang, when they failed in their attempt to attack, at least their investment/hardware have a place to go.

Can you math? To get 250k tps would require 20gb blocks every 10 mins. The best connection for home user won't do that. Then so they say storage is not a problem. Math again tell us it's 20gb*144 blocks a day. That's 2.8tb. The largest hard drive you get for $200 bucks will be full in 3days. So tell me that's the way forward.

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:42:46
I think you fail to recognise that this is a network, you need to not only receive but transmit and propregate the blocks. You can't calculate 10mins for a node to sync and end at that, cause it will take hours for the entire network to sync. And so node owner have to delicate a fibre line? What's the cost there if my home internet is 95% allocated to running node?  My point is increasing block size alone is not going to work.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:58:46

i think you are understanding it the other way around.  The 2x part is bundled with segwit to get 80%, its not what 80% want, at least not from this reddit. If it is the case like you said, why can't 80% consensus fork 2x without segwit in the first place.

And whats your point? (as of now) 90% of provider are segwit ready, 90% of nodes have upgraded.  You dont understand the network, going big blocks means 100% upgrade. all services need to upgrade to the new rule. Theres no all merry talk of nobody need to do a damn thing and it just magically work for your big block, meanwhile segwit is so hard to achieve.

Did you come out with a solution? Did you invent anything? Dont be a hardhead. You believe in absolute POW, so what do you believe in before POW was created? How do we move to something better if POW is already the best we can come out with? I pointed out a scenario whereby believing in absolute POW can be a weakness.

I don't know what you are still fighting for. If segwit2x   get segwit activated before aug1, bip148 won't work anymore. Thou I doubt btc1 can deliver, are you still suggesting we deploy another uasf. 
For agreement sake, let's just agree that segwit2x is likely stalling.

@_date: 2017-06-14 15:37:36
The thing is before he would want to come back, he likely would try to attack the uasf chain. And if user chain has too low of the hash to defend, we would respond with pow change. And the door to come back would close on him, and it would be sad for those honest miners supporting bip148. The best hope for these honest miners is too make sure Bip148 do a landslide win fast and defend any attacks. 
This remind me of the Dr Strange movie. Getting stuck in your own cause and effect.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:52:34
USAF chain will never die. If an attack is justify then it would mean that uasf chain has enough support (at least to be an alt coin). Once the attack start, USAF chain will UAHF to survive. legacy miner has no where to go except join bitmaincoin. So what we will have left is a formidable contender to bitmaincoin and up to the "economic majority" to decide which chain is the real bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:07:00
This I disagree. I'm all for uasf, but if segwit2x code is good and can really deliver timely, I think most will go along with it. I will still run core, nothing change. Then evaluate if bigger blocks are needed after segwit.

Chances of 2 permanent chain from this uasf is very low. There could really be only 3 outcome 
1. Uasf failed. Nothing change. Price would dive as investors hoping for progress exit.
2. Uasf succeed. Chain reorg. Price rocket.
3. Uasf succeed. miner hard fork. Price of bitcoin &gt; new alt coin.
Chance of a hard fork is low, if miner want to do that, they could have done it months before.
