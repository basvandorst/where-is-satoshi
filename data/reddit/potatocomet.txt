Not a real fight, the other fighter kept punching the air like a children. Just for entertainment, like Andre the Giant

I think this is true for drugs. Things that cause dependance and people buy no matter what.
Now, I heard that Kinder Egg is banned in the USA, people want is more because its banned?? Sure, youd pay more for the curiosity, but not that much

In private she just rolls her eyes whenever I talk Bitcoin.
In public she says that I'm a Bitcoin specialist.
She likes it, she just dont sees it future and would have already cashed out

yeah.. you couldn't buy anything with it and the price will go to $10 because there's not enough demand.

Exactly, alcohol causes dependence. My point is still valid

They would ban all exchanges and freeze its wallets. Then ban all companies from accepting or using it. Then if they find that you are using crypto they would fine you or jail you since crypto at this point would only be used by criminals. Since nobody could trade it, the price would go down to around 10-100.
You can't ban a technology they say, but you can make it unusable.

the offer that went down.
and cocaine causes dependance, people will buy no matter what. I dont think bitcoin is like this

This is betting, if the price stabilize the addiction will be over. A true bitcoiner doesnt bet.

Makes sense

I'd like a headless mode that I could install on a raspberry pi and manage it on other devices

Less robberies and more kidnappings

I was thinking about this post..
Sure, they can't BAN Bitcoin, Bitcoin is unbannable. I'm running Bisq here.. they cant ban this..
But I believe that they will fight a lot.. I mean, the State losing the monopoly over money?? "What you mean  I cant devalue my currency????" 
They can ban business from using or accepting it, they can scare the shit out of people, they can make it difficult for people to declare it to IRS.
By making it so difficult, the average Joe wouldnt use it, we wouldnt have mass adoption and the price would fall. OR the price would rise because of scarcity. idk
At the end of the day I was just worried about what would happen to what I've invested so far and was seeking to know what happened when other countries (Iran maybe?) banned it.

Bitcoin can be anonymous.
The problem is at the entry/exit points

Take a look at coinjoin
You can use it easily with wasabi wallet
@_date: 2019-12-02 19:10:07
Do you keep it in wasabi?
Is it safe to use coinjoin? Can't your coins be tainted?
@_date: 2019-12-22 12:18:26
I have some btc on cold storage and I fear that it can be linked back to me. Should I coinjoin it now or should I wait for the privacy features to mature?
@_date: 2019-12-28 11:45:15
Well.. People treat money itself as a hobby, wearing dollar signs etc.
Besides, bitcoin represents a lot more than its use as money or store of value and the community is awesome.
