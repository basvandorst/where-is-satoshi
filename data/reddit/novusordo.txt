I was a bit older than you when I started buying BTC with my money from mowing lawns. Definitely glad I did, and it was a small risk that I chose to take at an age where I had very few financial responsibilities (no bills, credit cards to pay for, etc).
Here's $5 worth of bitcoin. Check out the [changetip FAQ]( for how to get it to your own wallet. Changetip recommends Coinbase, however, I recommend Electrum or Multibit. If you have any questions, ask away.

It was a bug that was fixed *impressively* quickly. It shouldn't have happened in the first place, but it's a great example of how quickly the bitcoin-core dev team and the community can act to avoid problems. This occurred back when Satoshi was still around.
Most security vulnerabilities in bitcoin-core (previously bitcoind &amp; bitcoin-qt) are fixed before they're exploited. The devs take the security of the network seriously, and "preventative maintenance" is usually how they prove it.

Good to hear. I recently had an order canceled at Tiger Direct and they've been pretty terrible to say the least. They had to ask ME for the BTC address and TXID for some reason, even after they had the order number. Then, they refused to give me a refund in BTC, instead giving me store credit that I didn't want, and I'd have to call them in order to place an order with it. I requested that they just give me a gift card for the refund total, and I'm still waiting...

I certainly wouldn't say that he went berserk.  isn't even the right place to talk about that, so a kick from the channel was appropriate. Jeremias continued after being told not to, so he was banned.
It technically **would** be illegal for someone from the US to pay someone in Iran in BTC. Iran is sanctioned, and SHA256 is the US government's. I'm not saying that we shouldn't try to help the Iranians with Bitcoin, but  certainly is not the place to discuss this. Many of the developers are from the US, so they need to tread carefully around topics such as this.
Discussion on this should take place in a private channel, not the (logged) official public channel for Bitcoin development.

There are not many people who sell Bitcoins in exchange for Paypal, because of the large risk of chargebacks. If you *do* find someone willing to sell, generally they overcharge by an exorbitant amount because of the risk involved.
However, if someone compromised a Paypal account they wouldn't care about the extra charge, which just adds more risk for the seller.

Perhaps there should be an update to the client that lifts the 1MB limitation only at a certain block number, sort of like how the block halving is set up right now. This way, there would be plenty of time for nodes to update, then the whole network will switch over at the same time.

Ah yes, upvotes: the premier way of measuring intelligence.
Double-spends occur when  someone sends coins without a fee to one address, then seems those same coins to another address but with a fee attached. The person with the first address sees the transaction, but it never gets a confirmation. The second address will get a confirmation for the transaction.
Basically this makes it so that you can trick someone into thinking you paid for something, but you actually sent the coins back to yourself.
To avoid this, just wait for a few confirmations before considering a transaction valid.

I'm with you so far...


Yes, this is true.


This statement assumes that the rest of the network simply stops growing, and it is wrong. BFL miners are showing up in the wild (like the one Ars Technica received), Avalon will be shipping out its new batches, and on top of that, BitFountain (the company behind ASICMINER) is selling a good chunk of the equipment it creates. This reduces BitFountain's potential hashing power and distributes it to others.


Definitely, except for those with free power. Many miners are upgrading their rigs, however. Even FPGAs will continue to be profitable for some time, especially if people have already paid them off.


It isn't a disaster, because the chances of BitFountain acquiring 90% of the total hashrate are extremely small. For this to happen, BFL and Avalon would both have to fail miserably. It could be argued that BFL has already failed miserably, but in all seriousness, they're going to deliver at *some* point. 
Even if both companies completely failed, BitFountain would simply sell excess equipment while maintaining a safe percentage of the total hashrate. The guys behind the ASICMINER project are extremely intelligent, and you're not giving them much credit.
**TL;DR: No.**

It's the people not using "proper" paper wallets that need to change, not the behavior of the client.

50% is much more likely than your previous example of 90%, but I'm still confident that the people running BitFountain would make the right decision and keep the network safe. If they didn't, they'd be compromising their own business model.
If BitFountain acquires an amount of hashrate high enough for people to start worrying, people will sell, driving the price down. It would be extremely short-sighted and bad for BitFountain and its shareholders, so they simply wouldn't do it.

They see a lot of requests for obscene license plates, I'm sure that it was that someone thought it was some stupid way of saying "bitchin" or something.

I don't give a rat's ass if it's a common practice in this subreddit (which it isn't), it goes against [Reddiquette]( 
You're telling people to go over to a subreddit they probably haven't even heard of to upvote a post, artificially moving it to the top of that subreddit. Downvote me all you want, but soliciting upvotes makes us look bad, and we shouldn't do it.

I'm just coming to understand Ripple by selling at these ridiculous prices right now. The whole concept of "issuers" of what basically amounts to IOUs for currency is great, and I think it's going to play a key role in exchanging BTC for other currencies in the future.
Except for XRP.

Looks like proxyfoxeh.redirectme.net might have pointed to their center of operations, but I'm not able to resolve the domain. 
redirectme.net is a no-ip.com domain, so I wonder if it got taken down.

It probably won't grab your name, address and phone number though.

I didn't say "cash out". People are going to need to convert BTC to dollars once in a while, no matter what.

If the botnet operators infected people's machines in the first place, that means the machines are probably still vulnerable.
Let's exploit people's computers, and instead of infecting them, we act as an antivirus for them!

As a shareholder, I actually hope that person gets in contact with Bitfountain and gets their coins back. That's a ~$25,000 mistake, and I wouldn't want to profit from something like that.

Please learn the definition of "meme".
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:44:56
Wonder no more.
Meme: noun.
An element of a culture or behavior that may be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, esp. imitation.
Does Amanojack's use of the word fit this definition? No, it does not.
