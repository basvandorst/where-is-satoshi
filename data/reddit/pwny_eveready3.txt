Here are some quotes from his diary:
"Money is one motivating factor for me. If it wasn’t I wouldn’t impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor. Money motivates me for two reasons. For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause. I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant. "
The Armory sold guns.  Closed entirely because not profitable enough.
“As most of you have figured out, we are closing the Armory. Your first question is probably “why?” Well, it just wasn’t getting used enough. Spinning it off originally was done somewhat abruptly and while we supported it, it was a kind of “sink or swim” experiment. The volume hasn’t even been enough to cover server costs and is actually waning at this point. I had high hopes for it, but if we are going to serve an anonymous weapons market, I think it will require more careful thought and planning.”
Never mentions Big Pharma or the "entrenched drug dealing monopoly", but does say this about government which includes healthcare . . and gasp, prescription drugs.
“This may shock some of you to hear coming from me, but we absolutely NEED government, and good government at that. In fact, the services the current governments of the world monopolize or regulate are some of the most demanded and needed: security/defense, law, dispute resolution, education, healthcare, transportation, utilities, quality control etc."

I'm not defending the parading of drug victims through the trial - personally I think its irrelevant.  I'm talking about the argument, made by the defense, that purchasing drugs through Silk Road vs The Street creates meaningful "harm reduction".  However, the vast majority of violence linked to the drug trade does not happen at the user level.  And you can even make a rational argument that any expansion of illegal drug trade increases the prevalence of gangs/production (where do you think the cocaine/heroin sold on Silk Road is coming from?).
I'm for relaxing drug laws, legalizing marijuana, but this argument, "oh people die from prescription drugs all the time!", therefore Ulbricht is innocent is asinine and poorly crafted.
Ulbricht didn't create Silk Road to "reduce harm", he didn't make it to "compete with the entrenched drug dealing monopoly", he made it to make money.  Let's stop pretending he was a crusader against big pharmacy or whatever else you want to rail against.  The only reason he didn't sell assault rifles was because it wasn't profitable.  Not based on any morality argument.  Selling cyanide and known poisons wasn't done to "reduce harm".  It was simply profitable.

You said the hardest part of bitcoins is to buy them, which outside of mining and trading goods, is the *only* way to obtain them.  You said, more specifically, its due to having using legacy banking systems when converting fiat to bitcoin.
It is impossible to remove this element from the bitcoin process, mainly converting fiat to bitcoin aka buy or get bitcoins.  Hence, why I made an analogy of oh, flying would be easy too if we removed the thing that is impossible!

Lol so you cant answer then?  I'm asking legitimate questions about fundamental aspects of bitcoin.  That a decentralized, public ledger from a computer science aspect is inherently inefficient.  Not to mention that bitcoin's low transaction fees are a direct result of mining subsidies, which are set to continually reduce in the future.  Without miners, bitcoin does not work - you do understand this, yes?  So if the few bitcoins they earn don't cover their operational costs (eletricity and rapid depreciation of ASIC equipment), how and why would they stay in business? 
In addition, as the future cost of mining increases, this eliminates miners from the overall pool, which further centralizes mining pools and increases the risk of a 51% attack.  A glaring problem, yet one that no solution has been found.
These are serious questions/concerns.

This is such a copout.  They are models.  
From the horse's mouth:
"It takes the log of the price of bitcoin, then the variance of that over the last 10 days to get a measure of the % fluctuation in bitcoin's price. The higher the value, the greater the volatility in price over those 10 days. But we want stability, so we take the inverse of that."
It's poorly crafted statistical analysis, which produces his prediction that "It's quite clear that whenever we have a strong period of stability, a noticeable increase in price isn't too far behind.".  That's the conclusion and purpose of these azop-stability charts.
This isn't simply presenting data visualization.  It's an interpretation and therefore forecasting/prediction/data attribute finding - the basis of virtually all data analysis.  Notice the buy/sell degrees are advised actions based on historical price/volatility path?  How is that not a model?
It's based on poor assumptions and has performed poorly.  Why anyone attributes any value to it, is beyond me.

The modern internet for the public (commerical ISPs connected at NAPs) wasn't until 1995.  Hotmail began in 1996.  The number of internet users for the first few years doubled every year.  Bitcoin is now 6 years old and has never come close to that kind of growth.  By 2000 (also 6 years from the beginning of retail/public access), 5% of the world was using the internet, again not only does that massively dwarf the user rate of bitcoin, but that was during a time when many people/countries didn't have the infrastructure to use it, unlike today with regard to bitcoin.

He also implies when you purchase stock, its literally going hat in hand to the company itself and exchanging cash for stock (with some bizarre contract that creates indentured servitude somehow?) . . as oppose to trading on a secondary market filled with fellow traders/investors . . like every stock exchange.

How do you think inflation is calculated?  Every month the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) surveys thousands of prices all over the country and generates the CPI or (Consumer Price Index).  The CPI measures changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households like BREAD, MILK, PETROL, UTILITY BILLS.

How about all the SFYL stories about bitcoin when they mistype something?  A bank can undo transactions (reverse a wire, cancel fraudulent purhcases via stolen card, etc).  In bitcoin, its permanent.  Or what happens when malware empties your wallet because you weren't super secure in handling your bitcoins?  What recourse do you have?  Or how about having your bank account federally insured up to 250K in case something goes wrong with your bank (theft, hack, or bankruptcy of bank)? 


Care to share?

Visa also frequently stress tests its system to see if it can handle 20,000 transactions per second for days.  Verdict?  It can and has been able to for years.
