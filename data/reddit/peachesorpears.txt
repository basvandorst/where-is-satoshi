$2.7M is not a gigantic sum to Pantera and could very well turn out to have positive expectation given the press storm and price increase that would follow. If somehow they actually did bid 900 it would not be because they were looking to pick up 3k btc.

You seem a little quick to make assumptions. The bet would be denominated in dollars. My escrow would be made with dollars. If you're not interested in money, that's perfectly fine too. Since one of the truths I know is that nobody would take themselves as seriously as you seem to, I'll just assume your account to be satirical. 
Congrats on the correct prediction, though. It was a very, very small minority that were guessing we would see sub-200 in the near future. But you were likely wrong about the price reaching the level it did in the first place so it looks like we're both 1-1, the only difference being what we wagered.

You're not wrong, I am very determined to come to grips with reality. And the reality is that Bitcoin is not 100% certain to fail, which is exactly what you're suggesting. And if you believe that to be the case then you should be short your entire net worth. If you don't trust exchanges enough then I will personally take the long side of the bet and escrow to an agreed upon third party.

I completely and wholeheartedly disagree with this statement. There are many, many parts of America where you can buy a kick-ass 4BR house for $300k or less. Assuming your investments beat inflation by 3% you mean to tell me you couldn't live on $51k/year (gross) without a mortgage payment? And that is assuming you don't deplete the $2M at all. If ever I should have $2M I assure you I will be retired at that moment.

Because bitcoin isnt intended to be an investment vehicle. Buy into bitcoins so you can send money to your son who is studying abroad on the other side of the planet. Buy into bitcoins because eventually governments will print so much money you have to sweep it off your driveway to get in your car. Buy into bitcoins so your wife doesn't see a charge for Anal Sluts 13 on your credit card. Buy into bitcoins to play poker and other gambling games online and experience near instant deposits and withdrawals (with complete anonymity!). Buy into bitcoins to use Silk Road. Already there are myriad uses for bitcoin, both perfectly legitimate and very shady, despite it having an infinitely small share of the market.

Bingo! I also think a lot of will-be buyers are taking a passive approach with the holiday weekend. There are millions of dollars in buy orders between 80-90 and I suspect most of these people will buy bitcoins even if they end up having to pay 100. Eventually they will run out of patience or other aggressive buyers will force their hand and they'll start chewing through the asks instead of waiting around for people to sell into them.

Ok let's assume the end result for bitcoin is binary - .5% of the time it reaches $60,000 and 99.5% of the time it ends up at $0. It is mega high risk and the implied price is $300, so it would have a positive expectation if you can buy it for &lt;$300.

Your thought process is utterly baffling. Whether you buy or sell an asset should primarily depend on your valuation of the asset. "Locking in profit" is a common and irrational strategy. Sure, it's acceptable to sell if the growth has caused the asset to become a too-large percentage of your portfolio, but the only reason to sell bitcoins at $48 is if you think they are worth less than $48 or that there will be a drop and you can buy them back cheaper soon (ignoring extenuating circumstances).

I am sure the majority of people who sold off have no intention of getting back in yet. Sure some are trying to game the swings but the majority are done for now. It is for a lack of funds in the correct hands that the price is artificially low at this moment. Does that guarantee that the price will go up over the next several days? Of course not, but if sending fiat to Gox were as easy as sending bitcoins there then we would see a higher price right now.

Verification is needed to withdraw funds in a timely manner and given the extreme amount of people who have just exited the market I think a fair amount of the new places in the queue are held by people who have already sold.

1. lol? So as soon as someone's stores of gold hit an arbitrary value of $1M they just instantly liquidate and roll around in the fiat? Being a millionaire used to mean you were rich and set for life but thanks to inflation now it just means welcome to the upper middle class. 
2. As the price goes up, holders of bitcoin will desire to rebalance their portfolio and have the option to spend bitcoin instead of converting to fiat. 
3. This is beyond trivial. When the value is large enough there will be a shift to using mBTC.
4. I, too, avoid investing in any asset that doesn't have an upside of +100,000%!
5. TIL there are countries other than America in the world. America is a huge economy and making bitcoin completely useless to Americans would absolutely hurt bitcoin in the short term but it does not render it value-less to the entire world.

Correct. The bitcoin price is dictated by supply and demand so more demand stands to apply upward pressure to the price. With that said, it's pretty unlikely someone tipping $10+ on reddit could see a positive return on that "investment" unless they owned a fair amount of bitcoins.

Any merchant, exchange, or trader using a weighted average can easily be exploited since that price is not reflective of the current market price. For example the weighted average during a run up might be 120 while the spot price is 140. Nobody would be willing to sell coins at 120 or buy goods given a 120 rate of exchange since they could sell the coins for 140 and pay cash. In the other case where the weighted average is higher than spot price the merchant takes an immediate loss.

They have rental income, presumably equity in those properties, possibly pensions, and monthly social security payments if American. $20k does next to nothing for their retirement picture whereas $100k+ certainly does. Besides bitcoin isn't a lottery ticket, it almost certainly has a positive expectation.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:02:04
Nowhere did I say inflation is 3%. I agree it is absolutely higher. It's also far from mandatory your return come from dividends. I don't need a lot to be happy and I live in a cheap area so even if I can beat inflation by 2% I will be more than fine to live indefinitely.

1. Mid-20s male
2. Self-employed
3. I have accounts with 3 major US banks and they all treat me like shit. I just got fed up with it. I'm also in bitcoin for the potential monetary gains. Since I'm quite young, such extreme volatility is not so detrimental.
4. There can't be many people who follow bitcoin more closely than me and honestly I haven't got a clue. It's still so early, you know? As many people have noted, this is still an experiment.
5. People need to make themselves more knowledgeable about trading and markets if they own bitcoins or plan on buying some. I see several costly and inexcusable "mistakes" made (mainly poorly timed market orders on Mt.Gox) every day that unnecessarily increase the volatility of bitcoin. I am hoping this trend will die down some as the "old" bitcoins are moved into savvier hands in the form of new buyers.

"Get rich quick" doesn't exist without sharp trade offs. Bitcoin is probably the most volatile "investment" on the planet at the moment so be prepared to lose everything you put into it. And in the event it doesn't bust, you are far from guaranteed a massive return. It could stabilize at 300 for the next 2 years for all anybody knows.

Some people have more than 50-100 bitcoins. Even with "only" 1000 bitcoins you become a millionaire at $1000/BTC, which either changes your life or you have a damn good life already.

There are a few benefits. More often than not it gets the tippee immediately interested in bitcoin (at least enough to learn how to realize the value of the tip they've received). Sizable tips also tend to get a lot of upvotes and the visibility that comes along with that. Bitcoin is still very young and not many people, even on a tech savvy website like reddit, know much about it so each tip stands to catch the attention of a few people, further expanding the community.

Well (presumably) you didn't buy google, apple, or twitter either. If you count stuff like this as a mistake you'll just never find happiness. Nobody who has ever lived has lived anywhere close to optimally. The road is bumpy and as long as you learn from the past and improve going forward then you'll be way ahead of the curve. Millions of other people heard about bitcoin and ultimately decided not to buy any so you aren't in this alone. Forgive yourself and be thankful for the good in life. Oh, and buy some bitcoin now obviously.

I mean, it's completely necessary for the price to go up A LOT and fast if bitcoin is going to be anything remotely close to ubiquitous. People who got in early (right now is still early) will sell/spend them to balance their portfolios as the price continues going up.

@_date: 2013-10-29 20:39:23
Well the $.15 fee per transaction is a reason to do one lump buy but admittedly that's pretty negligible. If I personally had $x to invest per month I would spend the whole sum on the 1st. Why? I believe the price is much more likely to go up over any 30 day span than down.

It is worthwhile to note that, alongside creation, bitcoins are also constantly being permanently lost. While this happens with the USD as well, I suspect the % is much, much smaller.

I actually like this plan. There are definitely situations where hyper-volatile investments are wise.
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:23:41
The skepticism is vast and predominant. People are completely unwilling to even think about the benefits of bitcoin for 10 seconds just because it went from $30 to dust in a day in 2011 and the price is extremely volatile in general. They see people making money from the increasing price and feelings of jealousy and bitterness manifest themselves in denial, anger, and close-mindedness. For these people it will take a hell of a lot of convincing before they are ready to give bitcoin a fair chance.

@_date: 2013-11-06 03:02:59
Do not risk what you cannot afford to lose. Bitcoin is extraordinarily volatile and there is a very real possibility that you will lose most or all of your investment. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:17:54
I would advise against cheating on your taxes. You've made $30k and you want to take a risk like this just to keep the government's hands off of $4.5k of that? (I'm assuming you're American.) I think most governments do a woeful job of spending tax dollars but, imo, the risk is rarely worth it.
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:17:47
A lot of people are thinking/feeling the same way you are. Obviously that will make these dips more elusive.

Coinbase is good for Americans and Bitstamp is good for anyone, including Americans. Mt.Gox is awful and should be avoided if at all possible. There have been some negative reports on CampBX popping up lately so I would avoid them too.

Everything is relative my friend. $100 per BTC may sound "high" to many simply because it's higher than bitcoin has ever been in the past. In terms of long-term potential it is still a significant bargain, in my opinion anyway.

True, but for bitcoin to have any REAL success it will need a much larger market cap than it has now and it's going to take a lot of volatility for that climb to happen.

I think we have added enough bitcoin believers this time around to provide a much higher bottom than the last crash and I do agree this is almost entirely the fault of the exchanges. However, the damage is done. Every outlet that ran a "bubble" story will now run an "I told you so" story.

I'll start slowly turning it into gold starting around 3-400. I'll never exchange all of my BTC or likely even half but at some point I need to diversify. I think buying gold with bitcoins is great because it supports a merchant who accepts bitcoin and also doesn't increase my exposure to fiat.
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:42:48
The market cap is still so small in the grand scheme of things. When Bitcoin's uses expand and the public becomes more aware of it then the market cap will grow and the economy will be less easily influenced.
