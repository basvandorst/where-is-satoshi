Yes exactly. There are many companies who are accepting crypto for payment. Recently saw Gmass is also accepting btc for thier product. Yes  the crypto market is evolving slowly and people are accepting it as means of transaction. Just wait and watch crypto will bring an evolution and it has already started.
