If you're in Buttcoin it can't be for fun YOU'rE OUT. 
If you're in Bitcoin it can't be for fun YOU'rE OUT.
If you're in Reddit it can't be for fun..

Its probably because dogecoin's own subreddit praises bitcoin, or because its the second most popular subreddit related to cryptocurrency. Or they actually don't allow it at all for the most part. Ask a mod here how many doge pandering posts they have deleted.

Ebolacoin is the only way to go.

True, but look at any given new's article on Dogecoin "It started as a joke, *but now*" 
Dogecoin may have a wacky goofy community, a silly look, but its starting to being used for serious things and starting to take itself more seriously and its spreading like wildfire.

I honestly believe that would work. Also, you're completely insane. Dogecoin is so pro bitcoin it isn't even funny.

Uhh the proof that this guy is who he says he is? That might be a good start. Seems like a lazy troll, anyone could make up fake user data.

Oh good huge congestion on the block chain. 
What a terrible idea.

You're absolutely right actually, it really is the opposite of innovation.
Lets base a currency on wasting computational power! -Innovation
