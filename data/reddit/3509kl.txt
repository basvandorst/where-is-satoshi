peer to peer mining. Decentralized.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:49:28
try slush or p2pool
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:25:16
I know you are a long time reddit user, but, honestly, how old are you??    
P2P, peer-to-peer, by definition means DEcentralized.    
P2P mining means any joe who fires up an ASIC or CPU, gets their share. But there is no hub, nothing central.    
I'm sorry if I seem condescending, but I think I must be a lot older than you are. Or you are retarded

I love IPAs! I ordered dogfish head 120 and my neighbor received the parcel. For some inexplicable reason, he decided to share my beer with his friends while they were partying. Carlos had a dogfish head 120. He was used to tecate. Teasing and hilarity ensued :)    
I agree that it's possible bitcoin may not be the cryptocurrency to succeed (though i suspect it will be the one). However, I am confident that cryptocurrency, in one form or another, and barring an extinction event, will definitely replace western union, moneygram, credit cards, and potentially will replace banks. The problem is that most of us are stupid, and half of the smart ones are predators.    
again, drunk talk :)

Mining should ABSOLUTELY be idiot proof. Otherwise it will be centralized
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:35:18
YES! exactly. everyone, read this ^
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:17:26
cheap beer.    
And yes, star trek universe is the utopia i envision :) but with more exploring and less fighting.    
Anyway, seriously, what do you think about cryptocurrency? Do you think it will just replace Western Union, or can you see a future without banks?

pools are centralized. ELI5? pools are badddddd.    
Unless they are peer-to-peer pools (ELI5: friends working with friends, no boss)    
read the whole thread here. You'll get the gist
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:59:33
Oh my goodness: you're right!! I'm so sorry. Thank you for being patient and explaining everything. I hope you have a wonderful day, and all the best to you and yours
@_date: 2014-01-09 01:34:12
yes, the concept of P2Pool, but user-friendly. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:06:17
ps your understanding is false. I agree that the network is basically centralized, but it *doesn't need to be*. A HUGE portion of the hashrate are independent miners mining for large pools.    
I do agree that there is depressing amount of gullibility and "get rich quick" mentality around here. But it's the market
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:58:01
u/quirk, I will try to explain this to you. Please understand that I am not your enemy, but i do understand bitcoin. Ok?    
The word "bitcoin" refers to two things. Bitcoin is a financial network, and Bitcoin is a currency/commodity. This is undeniable.    
    
The financial network of bitcoin is the most important aspect. The blockchain and the miners. Why are miners important? Simple: because the more of them there are, and *especially* the more distributed/decentralized they are, the more secure bitcoin as a currency/commodity is.    
Right now, at this moment, bitcoin mining is NOT decentralized or P2P. It isn't. Read more, and learn.    
    
Currently, mining is concentrated in pools, like ghash and btcguild. These pools are PRIVATE. They are CENTERS.    
There is also a DECENTRALIZED option for miners called P2Pool, but it is not easy to use.    
I'm putting up 10 btc of my own reserve because I want cryptocurrency to be successful. I want to transition financial power from the banks to the people.    I aspire to be altruistic. It's a steep slope :(
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:49:17
huh? you need to visit a psychologist. I think you have irrational paranoia. There's medicine for that
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:07:14
P2P mining would work for small miners if it was easy and they all did it
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:23:18
wow! reddit is so weird sometimes
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:35:48
fwiw, a significant portion of the hashrate is running on windoze. anyway: yes, 10 btc for p2pool-magic-miner.exe. As I said.    
Like cgminer, that means "sharing the qualities of, and or mirroring the functionality of" cgminer. An executable that you can execute which will P2P mine with your hardware. It's really not a complicated concept

you are wrong. hard to admit huh? keep reinforcing your ego, go ad hominum, agrue to infinity, and see where that gets you. good luck, and good night
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:16:39
but also avoid Eligius because LukeJr is a religious fanatic. P2P or Slush. Yeah, avoid Eclipse/Josh/BFL too!!
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:03:40
Why are you angry? Do you not agree that the bitcoin network needs to be decentralized? Do you want it to be dominated by huge private pools?    
I'm not sure what you're upset about, but I hope your day gets better.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:06:39
how does it feel to always be right? I'm just curious because I'm feeling kind of liberated right now, me being wrong and all
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:02:07
I'm crazy, but I know it, and i think that's different from being insane. Anyway, I'm also tired. goodnight

The current mining situation for bitcoin is that miners are pooling, or sharing their mining power.    
Miners, especially small ones,  need to pool in order to receive rewards.    
Unfortunately most miners are pooling together at private, centralized, closed-source pools.    
It's so bad for bitcoin. Centralized pooling may be the downfall of bitcoin. Mark my words.        
There is a decentralized, P2P option called P2Pool, but it is not user-friendly- not at all.    
This bounty is for a simple, idiot-proof (I'm an Idiot), solution.

when someone has a strong ideology that permits action against non-believers, it's dangerous. He has publicly used the term "heretics". He could justify theft from heretics for the glory of God.

I agree that wallet security is VERY important. However, if the network behind the wallets is broken...
Miners (i hate the term, let's say: Transaction Processors), Transaction Processors are critical to the security, stability, and longevity of btc.
