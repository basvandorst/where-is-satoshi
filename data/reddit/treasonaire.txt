If you were to double spend, you can choose to send the same coin to a new address, preferably one you control. The original party will not receive your btc. 


You have your word seed with the Nano S so you can double spend as you wish. You need to extract your private key from the seed for the specific address the btc was on, and then manually craft a double spend transaction.
Google will have all the info. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:08:33
How many bytes was the transaction? 
Not all transactions are created equal. Some are larger than others and require more fees, especially when they have more than one input. This was probably the case for your dad. 
Look up the transaction on blockchain.info and get back to us.

I stopped buying from Uphold recently because 10% fees for a cc buy is just ridiculous. They process all cc payments as cash advances, meaning that I need to pay even more fees and immediate interest to my bank per buy. What's worse is that Uphold doesn't disclose this anywhere on their site, so their whole cc buy option is outright dishonest.
Verifying my identity isn't a concern for me as I have nothing to hide. Uphold crossed the line when they pulled this shit though.

Your fee here is not 0.001 btc or $1, it's 0.0001469 btc, which is approximately $0.15. That's relatively on the lower side for 225 bytes (~65 sat/byte). Your transaction will probably confirm within 10 blocks according to current stats.

Apologies, I was off with my numbers. I edited my post to reflect the proper figures. 
The outgoing tx is 9927 bytes in size, and that's for one single address. 1 MB seems totally achievable, no?
@_date: 2017-03-12 03:45:45

@_date: 2017-03-12 03:30:27
By consolidating, do you mean spending partial amounts on the address? I thought an address' entire balance is moved whenever any amount of Bitcoin is sent (with the change going into a change address).

To my knowledge you wouldn't be able to buy from any exchange/brokerage as they all follow KYC/AML regulations.
Localbitcoins is likely your best option. You can either meet with a vendor in public or deposit cash into a bank account with the bitcoins held in escrow, as you usually aren't required to have an ID or be a certain age to deposit.
This is all coming from personal experience in the US - I'm sure the situation in the UK is very similar.

I'm not surprised software like this actually exists.
I researched the page and thought I should mention a few things:
1) They've been brute forcing the network for about 380 days now and have found 0.1228 btc in total.
2) Disappointingly, more than 0.1 btc found were from a "puzzle" game and were purposely placed in easy to find keys by the pool owners. Only 0.0228 btc were actually cracked from 3 separate addresses, likely due to bad random number software.
3) They analyze more than 10 trillion addresses per day, and are operating at a huge loss. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:14:22
You're about to catch the dump
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:07:59
The idea is that the network will expand by the year 2140 (when the 21 millionth bitcoin is mined) in a way that transaction fees alone will be profitable for miners. Until then, miners will have a block reward, which currently stands at 12.5 BTC per block, halving every four years or so.
If a fraction of the world's commerce is done on BTC in the future reaching this won't be a problem.

@_date: 2017-08-10 23:11:56
In the very last block (479997) transaction fees collected alone total to 1.5 BTC or more than $5,000.
This will increase exponentially with further developments to the bitcoin network, with the most obvious step being an increase in the block size. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:46:12
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:42:00
Miner fee is calculated per byte. Your transaction was a few times larger and had more bytes than the average transaction, so you had to pay the proportionate amount in miner fees. 
Also, your wallet is a bit outdated. It seems you paid 506 satoshis per byte, which is very high. You need a wallet that supports custom fees like Bitpay on iOS.
With the current fee landscape, a $5.06 fee (120 satoshis per byte) would have been more than enough for your large tx to be included in the next block.
The bitcoin/dollar percentage has nothing to do with fees. It's all about the size of your transaction.

@_date: 2017-08-15 05:38:59
It wouldn't matter.
When an address is properly generated with complete randomness, as long as you don't expose the private keys/word seed to an online machine, it should be completely safe from any supercomputer on earth.
There are more bitcoin addresses than there are atoms in the known universe. Brute forcing bitcoin private keys is tantamount to analyzing every individual atom in the universe - an attempt would take billions of years and an infinite source of energy. Therein bitcoin's security lies.
Edit: What you should be questioning is whether the wallet software you use has sufficient randomness built in.

Hitbtc 
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:24:12
No. Here's where you're wrong. 
When supply decreases, price goes UP! Not down. 
The miners' current block reward of 12.5 BTC is actually bad for the price. 12.5 BTC are introduced into the supply every 10 minutes, devaluing the existing supply. 
This is what's known as inflation, or introducing new supply that devalues the current supply.
So every four years, bitcoin's inflation rate is halved. Sometime in 2020 the block reward will be reduced to 6.25, which will drive the price higher.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:20:05
The mining process will never stop. In the year 2140 after the last bitcoin is mined, miners will subsist entirely on transaction fees.
I don't know why you associate mining with the current price at all. The current bitcoin price is not dictated by miners whatsoever, but rather by the market forces of supply and demand.

It's back for me. Will post txid when available. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:55:06
That's correct.
To avoid this delay, next time you should consolidate your many outputs at night with a low transaction fee (20 sat/byte is good), since the mempool typically empties out and your tx will likely be confirmed by morning. This way your many btc transactions will become one output.
You can spend with ease during the day after consolidation. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:12:54
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:20:24
Yes, mining work depends on the subsidies. Subsidies do not depend on mining. I agree on that, but you weren't exactly saying that earlier. 
As for your second point: when the mining gold rush is over is when the price will really skyrocket. In 20 years when each block yields just 0.390625 BTC plus tx fees, prices will be in unimaginable heights, so long as the current demand stands. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:01:48
I edited my original comment. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:28:17
Printing the sheer amounts required to buy even 10% of all bitcoin in existence would severely crash the attempting central bank's currency through hyperinflation.
Newly printed money dilutes the current money supply, decreasing the value of everyone's fiat notes through the laws of supply and demand. These basic laws of economics are what's stopping central banks from conjuring up $1 trillion out of thin air specifically to buy a ton of bitcoin (or anything else) - doing so would risk creating another Venezuela or a 1920s Weimar Germany situation with hyperinflation.
If a central bank was to attempt such a thing for any reason, however, bitcoin's supply would be severely constrained and the price of bitcoin would skyrocket to ridiculous heights. From there it'll be very difficult to bring back down completely, with all the attention such a movement would bring.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:55:02
Yes. You seem to agree yourself, the mining hype train for bitcoin has long past for westerners like us. Knowing this, it's safe to say mining has no effect whatsoever on the current demand.

Relatively high fees, long delays, ineffective and slow support, dishonest price representations, unwarranted banning of accounts, and excessive breaches of privacy are a few things that immediately come to mind. 
Many of these inconveniences admittedly stem from KYC/AML laws, but it's well known that Coinbase is unduly overbearing when it comes to regulations compared to its competitors. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:46:02
Coinbase's fees are about 7x what Gemini charges, and 5x what Gildera charges. It doesn't seem like it though, because Coinbase bakes in a large portion of their fees into the Bitcoin price itself. They only disclose to you a 1.5% markup on the already inflated Bitcoin price. Hence, "dishonest price representations."
I've listed below the current costs to buy 1 BTC from each exchange:
Coinbase $805.02 (ACH bank transfer)
Gemini $788.93 (ACH bank transfer, available for immediate trading)
Gildera $789.37 (ACH bank transfer)
Just based on the prices they charge, Coinbase should be completely out of consideration when it comes to buying Bitcoin.

Mining has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin. 
The value of bitcoin is based entirely on supply and demand.
If the price of bitcoin cannot sustain a miner, he or she will simply mine another coin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:58:50
No, you misunderstood me. 
The price of bitcoin is wholly determined by what others are willing to pay for it, based on factors like scarcity and utility. In other words, I'm describing supply and demand.
If the market price determined by supply and demand (currently $3,426/btc) is unable to support a miner's operations, he or she will move to a different coin.
This is much like mining gold - gold miners do not collude and sell gold at an inflated price to cover their overhead costs and make more profit. The price discovery of gold is entirely based on what others are willing to pay for it.

If what you say is true, (I'm finding very little information about it online), then any coins stored on blockchain.info wallet are vulnerable to malware. The user's only line of defense in the scenario would be 2FA, which according to many posts here on r/Bitcoin has been cracked before (sources below). No matter what, you should NEVER rely on a third party to keep your coins. The best way to store funds is to use either a hardware wallet or paper wallet created in an offline environment to eliminate the risk of theft.

I use Acorns too. Robinhood is also a good investment app that lets you directly purchase and trade stocks with zero fees. 
However, stocks are at a historic all-time high right now. If you check out the all-time charts for the S&amp;P, NASDAQ, and Dow Indexes you'll see that we've seemingly arrived at a precipice where the stock market will inevitably crash - think 2008. In other words, stocks are an extremely risky investment right now - at least in my opinion. Your Acorns portfolio is almost certainly exposed to the stock market. 
That is why I've moved every dollar I had on the above mentioned platforms into bitcoins. I've made a handsome gain so far and I don't see myself selling anytime soon.

Blockchain.info has shown that they can be hacked and users can be locked out of their accounts, like during the DNS hack for example. Just because they've updated their old wallet does NOT mean that their current implementation is impervious to hacking.

Something that could possibly threaten bitcoin in the far future is quantum computing. To protect yourself against quantum attacks, you can just add a password to your 12 word seed and never reuse addresses (spending from an address reveals its public keys).
Even a quantum computer can't brute force a fresh address.
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:00:05
Blockchain.info is a private company - coins you store on their web wallet are NOT under your control as you don't have access to your private keys. Your wallet identifier is just your username to login to their web wallet account. 
Their company name may be a bit misleading for new users, because storing coins on "the blockchain" as in a paper wallet or hardware wallet with private keys you control is not the same as storing them on blockchain.info. 
I recommend you learn about LiveUSB and create your very own wallet with private keys only you control in an offline environment using bitaddress.org. Either that or buy a Trezor hardware wallet, etc. 
Only then will you be completely safe from hackers and exit scams like those at Bitfinex or MtGox which I'm sure you're familiar with.

Can you present an argument instead of discrediting my statement as FUD without any support? I am fully invested in Bitcoin so I'm not one to tell lies that would harm my investment. 
When storing funds on the Blockchain.info web wallet you have no access to your private keys (unless you export a private key to their wallet, in which case you'd be exposing your keys to the open web, rendering your coins susceptible to malware on your computer). All you really have is a promise that Blockchain.info will pay out when you need your money, much like a bank. This is true of just about any web wallet in existence. If/when the website gets hacked the coins can be stolen, like in the case of Bitfinex, Cryptsy, MtGox and many other exchanges. Because of these factors it is never a good idea to keep funds on a web wallet. 
I'd like to hear your point of view. Where do you keep your coins?

I think it can effectively be used as both a store of value and medium of exchange. Bitcoin is used for both purposes today, and will improve on the latter through Segwit and the Lightning Network. 
I've been living 100% on bitcoin (if a Visa Bitpay card counts) since early 2016 and I use it to buy stuff ranging from groceries to paying my rent. Whenever I can, I pay with bitcoin directly. 
Hedge funds and investors are good for any large asset class. They bring lots of liquidity to a market. Many are aware of the possibility of bitcoin becoming a global currency and universally recognized store of value in the near future, and intend to hold for the long-term. I don't think institutional investors would drop billions on something based on hype and little substance.
@_date: 2016-12-17 06:14:25
It depends entirely on the kind of wallet you're talking about. 
If you send bitcoins from, for example, address A on a Coinbase wallet to a tumbler, then send the tumbled coins back to a different address B in the same Coinbase wallet, Coinbase won't be able to prove that the bitcoins that left wallet A are linked to the bitcoins you received in wallet B, provided the tumbling was done correctly.
However, since Coinbase's software links together addresses in the same wallet as a part of their service, they can easily see that X amount of bitcoins left address A of wallet Z, and shortly after X amount of bitcoins were received in address B of wallet Z. In other words, their internal software that generated the addresses, and not the blockchain, will show that the addresses - and bitcoins - are both linked to the same party. 
If you were to do the same thing with a service like Breadwallet, there is no central mediator or party linking address A to address B, so the coins will appear to have been sent and received anonymously on the Blockchain with no mediator being able to say or prove otherwise.
For complete anonymity I recommend generating paper wallets using bitaddress.org code from Github on an offline LiveUSB Ubuntu boot. The wallets you make offline are completely anonymous and won't be tied to you in any way if you tumble your coins properly.

I can see how they scare off new customers with the complexity of their fees lol. I had no idea how their fee model worked until I had no choice but to use their service after the whole mess with Circle. 
At this point I regret ever having used another exchange. Gemini is probably the cheapest Bitcoin exchange out there. Their exchange rate generally always reflects the true Bitcoin price without a shady markup like on Coinbase. 0.25% is the maximum Gemini charges on fees - they give rebates to customers who trade more than 1000 BTC with them per month, and that's what their chart is for.
Back to your original question - converting USD (fiat) to bitcoins will always be the most difficult part of Bitcoin until it goes mainstream. Companies like Gemini and Coinbase have to deal with the legacy banking system, meaning each time you buy bitcoins they need to pay Visa/MasterCard fees, banking fees, operational fees, etc. to perform their services. On top of that they need to make a profit. That is why no exchange will ever be free, until we skip fiat altogether to work and live on crypto.
But until then, ditch Coinbase - they are a parasitical and dishonest company and don't deserve anyone's business.

Boy, what a mistake that was.
My point here is that a 0.3% loss or gain in the world of btc (and even in the stock market) is completely negligible due to volatility. You'll regret your panic decisions in the long term when the price of btc is many times what it is today.

Upon analyzing fee levels, transaction frequency and amounts sent you can determine which addresses are responsible for bloating the blockchain by creating spam.

Lol no man. That's just selling. Shorting by definition is when you borrow shares to sell, hoping the price would drop. When you close a short, you rebuy the stock, repay the lender and keep the difference. 
This way you actually make money as the price falls, without adding to your position. 
By your definition, I guess simply buying a stock/bitcoin is going "long?" If so, that's also incorrect.

Trezor/Ledger/Keepkey/Bitpay/literally every software producer uses the BIP39 standard, meaning those words give you access to your bitcoin on any device that has internet. They are cross-compatible because it’s all BIP39. 
I can mix my btc and send them to a fresh address, and the government would have zero clue. I could even skip the mixer and just send the coin to a new address and the government would have a hard time proving anything. 
That’s why bitcoin is so awesome. The government can’t just stick their hands in an account and take what’s yours. If you do it right they wouldn’t find jack in a raid, either, because your keys are memorized. 
It’s an entirely different world with bitcoin. The government loses so much power.

As a newb, he probably thinks 1 XRP will go the way of bitcoin and moon to $4,000+. That just isn't remotely possible because there are more than 38 billion XRP tokens in circulation (most of which are held by the creators), which is more than 2,000x bitcoin's current 16.5 million. 
If Ripple were to reach where bitcoin is NOW, each XRP would be worth a paltry $2.20.

Governments don’t *need* to bail out anybody. They choose to, because it’s in their power to.
Many corporations today, like with banks and auto, would not exist had it not been for massive bail outs. The free market would’ve just taken its toll. 
The government chose to use *our tax money* and not to mention *print trillions* of new dollars, causing accelerated inflation, to bail out these corporations.
With bitcoin, honest taxation would be insanely difficult, more so than it already is with fiat. It’d be a joke. We both know governments won’t be able to freely print money, either, because bitcoin must be mined.

You pay a premium for anonymity and not having to consent to a KYC/AML anal probe on one of the major exchanges.
Also, banks shut down local bitcoins sellers fast with the kind of cash volume that comes with selling BTC.
Think about it. Say you have 10 BTC and decide to sell each BTC for a $400 markup. That’s $4000 profit per 10 BTC, but every time you make 4k you need to take in ~$60,000 in cash deposits from random people.

Incorrect. Ridiculous transaction fees hurt miners WAY more than LN ever could. 
Since they stopped spamming, miners make only about 0.2 BTC from fees, per block. LN would reduce that to roughly 0.1 BTC. With the spam attack they were pulling in 2.5 BTC or more. You’re saying they stopped taking 2.5 BTC per block because they want to stop LN?

Everything relative to the currency in question would be inflated. What matters is the supply of currency here relative to ALL goods. 
While bread and gold in 1934 Germany may have cost billions of Reichsmarks, in USD they were still priced regularly.
However, since the hyperinflating currency was used to buy Bitcoin, the supply of bitcoin would be severely constrained and the demand would be so high that Bitcoin even in USD would be astronomically high.

f here is a well known equation. 
x is the private key. 
y is the public address. 
To spend bitcoin, you need to solve the equation. In other words, you need to find private key x that corresponds to your public address y. 
Basically, a private key corresponds to just one public address and this is all proven cryptographically, or by solving f(x).
The private key is a huge number with 2^256 possibilities that virtually cannot be guessed by the laws of mathematics. That’s what protects your money on bitcoin.

Addiction results from human suffering and hopelessness. People use drugs to ease their pain.
Therefore addiction alone does not warrant imprisonment. Treatment and rehabilitation are far better options.
People that are violent and steal whether they are sober or addicted to liquor, pot or meth are the ones harming society.

Coinbase has announced they will release everyone’s BCH on 1 Jan 2018 but haven’t yet made a determination to support trading.
In other words, at New Years people will be able to withdraw their BCH to sell on other exchanges, but buying BCH on Coinbase still won’t be supported.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:46:24
Supply and demand. 
Bitcoin supply is constant. With the kind of demand you’re talking about, bitcoin won’t just stay at $5500-10000. It’ll literally explode to the millions. 
What do you think is driving the price right now? Demand. 
On the other hand, the supply of the printed currency will balloon while demand remains the same. This means hyperinflation for the fiat currency and less buying power after every bitcoin purchased.
What you’re describing is not possible. Retake economics. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:35:18
If bitcoin costs $1 million, it does NOT mean every bitcoin is for sale for $1 million. That’s the current market equilibrium based on supply and demand.
Stress the demand and supply and you’ll see huge changes. 
Take a look at the order books for any stock/bitcoin/crypto. The more one buys, the higher the price he must pay.

So you’re now admitting less than 2% of the funds are insured. Great, we’re making progress here. 
Trezor and Ledger take your BTC offline completely. Coinbase must reveal their keys once in a while to pull funds from cold storage addresses and that is when they are vulnerable to hacks.
HW wallets don’t have this problem. LiveUSB Ubuntu is even better for cold storage. Don’t ever give up control of your bitcoin.

Wrong. Inflation happens because supply increases faster than demand. 
Bitcoin is deflationary, meaning once all the coins are mined each coin will increase in value because no new supply is added. 
On the other hand the dollar inflates because the Fed constantly introduces new dollars.

When governments around the world can't keep up with their huge debts they will be forced to print lots of fiat money, driving the USD and all other currencies into hyperinflation.
People will soon demand a better form of money and bitcoin, if not another crypto, will be the answer. A multi million dollar per bitcoin valuation is totally possible, because before fiat goes the way of the telegram it'll hyperinflate to shit. 
We're slowly beginning to see it today.

From wiki on SR:
The site's terms of service prohibited the sale of certain items. When the Silk Road marketplace first began the creator and administrators instituted terms of service that prohibited the sale of anything whose purpose was to "harm or defraud".[16][72] This included child pornography, stolen credit cards, assassinations, and weapons of any type; other darknet markets such as Black Market Reloaded gained user notoriety because they were not as restrictive on these items as the Silk Road incarnations were.
So no, there was no CP. I used SR back in 2013 and lost btc during the seizure and I can attest to that.

The brain wallet - in my opinion - is the most secure, private, and personal way to store bitcoins for the long-term, if done right. If done incorrectly, it is a surefire way to lose your shirt.
Since all one needs to possess any amount of bitcoins is the private key, the brain wallet is simply a method of deriving a private/public key pair via SHA256 using an unique string of words or characters memorized in his or her mind. No hardware or paper wallet is necessary, as all the factors needed to produce the private keys are stored in the user's mind (the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog; correct horse battery staple). This allows for complete plausible deniability from prying eyes.
In my case, I've memorized a long and unguessable string of words and scrambling algorithms that don't exist in sequence anywhere on the internet. When compiled and hashed through SHA256 (on bitaddress.org, etc.) I am given my private and public address. With just the public address anyone can send me bitcoins, and with the private key I am able to access them.
Always use caution though - the brain wallet is meant for one-time use, and must be thrown away whenever the private key is revealed to a client for a transaction. It's really quite simple. I've had the same brain wallet securing approx. 30btc (and growing) for about a year now, and no matter what people say it is by far the best method of storage if done right. For a more in-depth explanation and demonstration, check out Youtube or do a google search.

Bank of America and possibly Chase let minors open a student account with a debit card. I opened a BOA account when I was 17, I'm sure their policies have not changed. You need $25 as an initial deposit though. After that you can buy small amounts from Circle, assuming you're in the US.

What's the fee per ACH debit, is it $5 per?

A simple google search would reveal the answer to that question.

Governments have two ways of raising money: levying taxes and printing new bills. 
Governments steal from you every day not through taxes but by inflation via the unlimited printing of fiat currency.
When the government prints more money, the value of all existing money is lowered via supply and demand. This is why the inflation rate in the US is approx. 2-5% - next year your $100 bill will only buy about $98-95 worth of goods in today's money, which is covert theft. 
With bitcoin the government may levy taxes in crypto but can never print new money to steal wealth from its citizens.

How do you send ACH transfers to your credit card account? I can't seem to find these features anywhere.

0.25% fees, compared to Coinbase's 3-5% fees. 
Bank transfers (ACH) take a few days like on CB, but you can wire any amount instantly and have your coins within 30 mins, something Coinbase does not offer. 
Verification took me less than 24 hours but that was before the latest surge. 
GDAX is Coinbase's equivalent to Gemini, but due to some recent events I'd stay away from CB's platform altogether.

What's your definition of moon? Let's say a $1 trillion market cap. 
If Ethereum was to reach a $1 trillion market cap, a single ether would be worth approx. $10k. (40x gain)
When Bitcoin attains a $1 trillion cap each coin will be roughly $57k. (20x gain)
So at the arbitrary market cap of $1 trillion, an investment in ETH today will be worth approx. double that of an investment in Bitcoin. 
However, ETH carries way more than double the risk of Bitcoin in my opinion so with this logic I've judged that it is not worth investing in ETH at this price.
In my eyes Bitcoin has a far greater likelihood of reaching $1 trillion as compared to ETH considering the latter's inflationary properties. 
Anyone care to discuss?

A new version can only exist on a separate network and will be treated as an entirely different currency.
The original network could assume less market share as a result of rising competition (see alt-coins) but this has nothing to do with inflation. 
For example, Zimbabwe printing their dollars to shit has little affect on the USD.

That's brilliant. Thank you!!

My timing seems on point nowadays.

GDAX is my backup due to its 0.25% fees. 
If you're willing to pay slightly higher fees I'd try Uphold or Glidera. These are brokerages however, not exchanges. You can buy from Glidera through Breadwallet or Bitpay. 
I hear Kraken is decent for wires as well.
