Aye I've seen it before. Was just wondering whether there is easily available data on data-size per transaction and real transaction speed limits, or whether anyone had already done some work on it.
What I'm also concerned about is the vulnerability of the network regarding flooding. For large organisations, a few million is pocket change, so if someone were inclined to spend that in transaction costs to overburden the network, the transaction size limit could become a real problem. 
For example, assuming a generous $0.04 per transaction in fees, a million bucks would get you 25000000 transactions. If the real maximum amount of transactions per second is around 3.5, that's enough transactions for about 7142857 seconds, or about 82 days of maximum capacity. To me this seems like a much more real problem than a 51% attack.

Actually, it's difficult to reduce point 2 to a properly short TLDR. His point isn't so much that debtors get into trouble, but that it'll have further negative impact on the economy as a whole and worsen a period of deflation. Basically:
(2) Whereas debtors cut back on spending because their loans become more expensive during deflation, creditors don't increase their spending with the same amount, resulting in a net decrease in spending.

How do you think his articles get all the clicks you're giving them right now? 
It's all just clickbait. You're bound to get much more attention by veering off into either absurdly optimistic or ridiculously wrong. For the Bitcoin crowd, it doesn't matter whether everything you say is a lie or a half-truth, as long as you're praising Bitcoin or blindly criticising anything non-Bitcoin it's all cool and will get you upvoted to high heaven. 
Contrarily, when you write criticism on Bitcoin, you'll get a lot more clicks by being incredibly offensively wrong, otherwise you're just mediocre and boring. The more you can infuriate people, the more attention you'll be able to draw. 
Stuff in the middle? The level-headed articles? Those are usually way too long for reddit, don't come with an easy to digest message, don't proclaim from the get-go to be pro or contra, and examine or explore rather than preach to the choir. But they're also boring, because they'll neither support a to-the-moon agenda, nor inflame passions by being absurdly wrong - so they'll get neither clicks nor upvotes.

7 transactions per second is a very old estimate that has little to do with the actual reality of transaction sizes. A while ago I took a few random blocks and checked the average transaction size in bytes, resulting in roughly 3-3.5 transactions per second. 
For example, a quick calculation over 6 blocks: 3092 transactions, roughly 1677 kb in size, or 555 bytes per transaction, which amounts to a maximum of roughly 3.15 transactions per second.

Bucketing has been made illegal since 1934 and it really shouldn't exist anymore. It still happens occasionally, but it's not really worth doing it on a risk/reward basis unless you can do it from a location without regulations in the first place.
A more common and dubious practice is brokers trading against clients. Basically, the majority of traders are undisciplined losers and gamblers, so it's fairly easy to come up with an algorithm that locates traders that will eventually go bust and then just take the other side of the trade. I'm not sure how widespread this is, but under Forex traders it has become common to look for an ECN broker rather than a dealing desk; an ECN is basically a direct connection to other market participants, rather than relying on broker-execution. Bucket shops are pretty much impossible on an ECN.
Far more common than that, and more profitable, are outright scams. Fake brokers that entice you to send money, then most likely trade for you and show you some profits to lure even more money into the trap (or allow you to trade, but none of that actually happens), and then simply never return you any money. If you're already in highly illegal territory, might as well go full throttle. 
If you ever gets calls from a random broker you never heard from before, there's a 99% chance they are fake and you should either have fun with them or end the call and block their number. I've had lots of fun with confusing the hell out of a few of them, picking up my phone with "Hello, this is the Center for Fraud Prevention", telling them that Mister Dubitator is already dead, or telling them that I'll connect them to myself - please wait a minute - and then just place the phone next to a speaker and put some elevator music on.

Stock is down 7% today because expectations weren't met. Overstock revenue was expected to grow to 344.9 and it 'only' hit 341.2.
Apart from that, a quick look through the last 5 years of their financial statements doesn't look convincing to me, mostly because their statements show very unstable growth, an inability to keep costs low, and a general lack of efficiency.
Overstock got hit hard earlier this year because back then they really screwed up on earnings. It looked good at first sight, with supposedly 88.51m in net income, but 72.65m of that was a one-time tax credit, leaving only 15.86m in net income, barely any growth from the previous year. Earnings per share (adjusted minus the tax credit) were at a dismal $0.04. Expenses had somehow almost doubled in 2013 compared to 2012. 
Based on financials alone, it's not a company I would invest in.

Linked? No. But after 2008 when the entire world seemed to go up in flames and safe haven assets were soaring, in 2011 the Swiss National Bank put a floor on the Swissie at EUR/CHF 1.20 to keep the swissie from appreciating too much and potentially causing problems for the Swiss economy. 
It's still there today and the price usually hovers around 1.20-1.25 which has made trading it pretty damn boring. And yeah, I guess it's questionable to still call it a safe haven asset. 
Still, could be worth to check up on whether the SNB would actually have enough firepower to maintain that price if we ever get another crisis; George Soros is famous for betting against the Pound/Bank of England when they intervened in the GBP forex market. If enough money really wants a forex pair to go somewhere, it takes a damn lot of money to keep it from doing so.

Correct. People call manipulation on anything as long as it allows them to shift blame or agency to an 'outside' factor and, if only this would stop, everything would become perfect again. 
It's just history repeating itself. I've seen the same rhetoric with every boom and bust I've either traded or studied. Bagholders who are underwater never attribute the downmove to an actual free market trying to discover a new price. It's always 'manipulation', 'just a dip', 'weak hands being shaken out'. It's a psychological defence mechanism so you don't have to take responsibility for your choices or rethink your investment strategy.
People need to go back to the basics, read up on some classic stock trading literature. Jesse Livermore is a good start. Back in 1923 he already wrote: 
"In a bull market and particularly in booms the public at first makes money which it later loses simply by overstaying the bull market. This talk of "bear raids" helps them overstay."

This really isn't as bad as everyone here makes it sound like. Most of the warnings in that article are stuff people should know about before they act. Sure, it's a bit overstated sometimes, but generally, there's info people new to Bitcoin should know before getting into it.
For example, Bitcoin ATM's. A lot of them are massive rip-offs that carry either a high fee, or a terrible exchange rate. I would never recommend anyone to buy with such an ATM, unless they know the actual exchange rate and can check it online with Bitstamp/Bitfinex, so that they'll know exactly how much money the ATM is charging them.
And most of the other stuff is decent advise as well. People on the internet telling you they can give you high weekly percentage returns on your investments are probably scamming you. You need to provide for your own wallet security. You should know the terms of your agreement with a wallet provider. You need to know that making a mistake in sending to a wrong address cannot be undone. You need to know that Bitcoin can be extremely volatile. 
You're all just bashing the article because it isn't a glowing recommendation of Bitcoin. But really, I'd rather have more people know more about how to protect their Bitcoin holdings - or at least be aware that they should know more on that topic - than just have another Bitcoin advertisement.

A question. Where, exactly, are these naked Bitcoin shorts going to happen or already happening? You mention this nowhere expect with vague allusions to Wall Street, Gox and exchanges in general.
- Do you mean various exchanges like MtGox, BTC-E, etc? As long as these aren't regulated properly or the Bitcoin community voluntarily switches to what it deems the most secure and fair market (and actually succeeds in doing so), there is little you can do against whatever goes on in these markets. I don't have much faith in the second option, seeing how that failed massively with MtGox, and regulation can only do so much seeing as how it is bound to mostly national boundaries and any exchange that would like to scam its customers can easily do so by being near-anonymously founded in a country with little to no proper regulation. 
- Do you mean the actual stock market? There are no Bitcoin ETF's as of this time. If these ever come to fruition, they'll be bound to the same rules every other stock is bound by, and a bunch of others that are ETF-specific. Yes, naked short selling does occur, but it is illegal and it is punishable. It's a problem that regulators have difficulty finding and prosecuting naked short sales (simply because anything but the most obvious short &amp; distort actions are difficult to gauge), but that doesn't mean regulation is worthless. 
- Do you mean markets other than the ones I mention above? 
Bitcoin is an especially difficult case because regulators and governments, and in fact the Bitcoin community, can't even come to a consensus as to what it actually is; a currency, a payment system, a commodity, all of them, or whatever. There is also a great disdain for regulation because it is imperfect, yet at the same time the Bitcoin community seems to realise that without proper regulation, shit like Gox can and will happen. Another problem is that regulation is slow as molasses, which means all sorts of scams can go on before someone writes some rules for this financial Wild West. Going entirely without regulation doesn't seem to be the answer to me. I'd rather have imperfect oversight than no oversight.

According to google finance, last year's revenue for Western Union was about $5.5 billion, with a net income of roughly 800 million, or in other words a profit margin of around 15%
Assuming similar profit margins for the entire remittance industry, that would mean out of a total of $34 billion in fees, the profit of the entire industry would amount to roughly $5 billion. If Western Union is a decent indication for profit margins in this industry, Andreas is wrong by a factor of 35.

For anything with a long-term positive drift (say, the S&amp;P500 or an index of the world's stock market), DCA'ing is in nearly all cases a less profitable strategy. You'll only end up better through a DCA-strategy if the market goes down or doesn't go up during the duration of your DCA, which runs counter to the assumption that you invest in something profitable.
The only reason to DCA is a psychological one, because people might not be comfortable investing a large, single lump-sum. However, if you only use DCA to inch yourself into a position you do not feel comfortable investing as a whole, you might want to revisit the strategy of investing such a sum in the first place and limit your exposure to a comfortable level. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 19:51:42
Eh, I wrote this in response to one question, but I might as well throw this out as general info for people unfamiliar with order types.
A stop order is a pending trigger placed at the exchange to buy or sell when the price reaches a certain point. Say you have 1 Bitcoin and you no longer want to hold it when the price falls to $400, so you'd place a stop loss at $400. When the price hits that point, your pending stop loss order turns into a market order to sell 1 BTC, 'stopping' your loss. 
However, because it's a market order, that sale will occur at the best price available on the moment your pending order triggers. If volatility is very high, you might experience slippage and the order might be filled at a worse spot than you originally planned (this depends on volatility, liquidity, as well as how good the exchange works), so a stop order isn't perfect, but it's still a good enough protection protection against losses. (there are exceptions; stop loss orders are completely worthless in REALLY high volatility environments, like leveraged foreign exchange trading during news events)
A trailing stop loss order is what it says, a stop order that trails the price. Say you bought 1 BTC at $300, but you would like to sell and stop your loss if BTC drops $50 in value. A trailing stop loss order automatically adjusts your stop loss up, always trailing behind the price, in this case by $50, and it only triggers if BTC ever drops $50 from its last high. So if the BTC you bought at $300 first goes to $600 and then drops $50, your trailing stop loss order would automatically trigger at $550 and attempt to sell your BTC at the best price available at that time. 
The reason why this might create spikes is that people are people and thus psychologically predictable. People attach value to round numbers, such as $500, or $400, or they perceive a certain resistance/support/trend-line as important, and thus they'll cluster stop loss orders around those places. A savvy trader with enough cash could hypothetically attempt to run the price to those psychologically significant stops through selling BTC. Doing so would trigger stop loss orders which turn into market sell orders which depress the price further, most likely hitting other stop loss orders and essentially creating a downwards price cascade. On exchanges with very little liquidity, like BTC-E, this happens more frequently because fewer people take advantage of such sudden drops in value. 
Conversely, in a market that supports short positions, this also works to the upside. Short positions that are protected by stop loss orders are basically pending orders to buy when the price reaches a certain point. A whole bunch of short positions closing, driving the price up, is commonly called a 'short squeeze'. 
However, trying to depress or drive a price up is not an amazing tactic and still carries a lot of risk. Welp, this turned out to be longer than I thought. Better stop here before I start repeating Jesse Livermore's chapter in defence of perceived market manipulation.

This has very little to do with the value of BTC or the value of USD, this is a bacon-scarcity problem.
Demand for bacon has increased over the last couple of years. Meanwhile, supply hasn't been able to keep up. Pig herds around the world are shrinking because pig-feed harvests were poor in the last few years, and in the US a virus killed millions of piglets. 
That's basically the TLDR of [this article](
Apart from completely ignoring basic economic factors such as supply and demand in the bacon market, that BACON/BTC/USD chart is misleading in other ways, assuming for example that you bought Bitcoin while it was low and under the radar for the vast majority of not only the general public but even the interested minority. 
I could make an equally misleading chart by comparing how much bacon you can buy with shares of a successful and extraordinarily risky over the counter or off-market stock. For example, since February 2012, Appalachian Mountain Brewery Inc (OTCMKTS:HOPS) has gone up 19900%. Imagine the bacon you could've bought with that! Sadly 20/20 hindsight doesn't pay you any profits. 
Meanwhile the dollar has actually been performing [extremely well]( lately. This should make importing goods from for example Europe cheaper, but unless you personally import goods I doubt you're likely to see much benefit from that.
Edit: spelling.
Edit 2: Screw it, I don't usually do this, but as a disclaimer, I own neither Bitcoin nor that weird stock I mentioned and never heard of before. It's simply the highest percentage gainer over the last 52 weeks according to google's stock screener.

No, I don't disagree with him and I believe it would be a serious problem for any economy with a fixed supply. People love to focus on banks and governments as large debtors, but the more important factor with regards to the economy is how companies rely on debt. 
If taking on debt becomes increasingly expensive and hoarding money increasingly profitable, companies as a whole would have an increasingly difficult time merely existing, never mind starting up or expanding, resulting in increased unemployment which feeds back into a decrease in spending which again influences corporate performance - you end up having what is basically a deflationary spiral. 
You don't want either an economy going out of control or going depressed, you want it to be neither highly inflationary nor deflationary. Floating exchange rates as well as an adjustable money supply are both incredibly powerful tools to control national economies. Such tools are invaluable and they aren't inherently bad or good. It's whether they are properly used. But even though I have my reservations about whether people as a whole are capable of doing so, especially in democracies where curbing exuberant growth is generally an incredibly unpopular political talking point, I'd rather have us try, perhaps fail, learn, try again, perhaps fail again, hopefully learn more, than to pessimistically do away with them out of fear of failure.
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:37:20
True, but you're looking at land mass. In terms of GDP, Russia is about the size of Italy. Not insignificant, but not particularly massive either.
Anyway, this is veering off from the initial topic. In terms of volatility, currencies are actually far more volatile than people generally know or expect. For example, the USD/JPY pair actually increased by almost 60% from around 2012 to now; EUR/USD went down about 12% in 2014 alone. That's a heck of a lot of movement. 
The important thing, though, is the effect this has or doesn't have on prices of goods. You can't just equate a 12% drop of the Euro against the Dollar with a 12% loss in value of the Euro, that's not how these things work. All it means is that it has become roughly 12% more expensive to import goods from the United States if you have Euro's. Meanwhile, a falling Euro (against the dollar) makes it cheaper for US companies to buy goods from Europe, so a falling Euro also has a benefit. 
If you have either Euro's or Dollars but aren't actively trading either of them on Forex or aren't involved with import/export, you're likely not going to notice a lot from foreign exchange movements. With Bitcoin, however, you're basically always holding a trade, for most people BTC/USD, but in Europe BTC/EUR. Any price change is going to have a direct impact on the value of your holdings, thus people are naturally more concerned about volatility. It's much more like holding a stock or a commodity in that sense. If you compare those, Bitcoin isn't particularly more or less volatile than, say, gold, silver, grains, or say British Petroleum, which also had a shit year and lost almost 30% value. It just doesn't compare quite that well with other currencies.

Is there any easy way to acquire data on the average byte-size per transaction for the last 100 or 1000 blocks or so? I'm curious because I suspect that the 7 transactions per second limit often repeated everywhere is actually much lower in reality. 
Just quickly browsing some blocks on blockchain.info for example:
Block 
Number Of Transactions 363
Size 153.064453125 KB
If I interpret that correctly, on average that's about 432 bytes per transaction. With a transaction size limit of 1 mb per block, that actually calculates to a maximum of 2427 transactions per block, and with a generation of 1 block per 10 minutes, that comes to a real limit of roughly 4 transactions per second. 
I don't want to go through all the data manually, but another quick calculation over 6 blocks: 3092 transactions, roughly 1677 kb in size, or 555 bytes per transaction, which amounts a maximum of roughly 3.15 transactions per second. That's a whole lot less than 7.
@_date: 2014-12-21 11:34:10
This, especially the 4 year chart of sustained transactions per second, is incredibly important and what I've been looking for. I was always curious as to whether there was a trend of growing inefficiency, and apparently there is. If this continues I wouldn't be surprised if the transactions per second goes below 2 in 2015.
I doubt it'll be given the attention it deserves though. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 14:17:10
Yeah the current real maximum tps seems to be around 3-4, but so far that's mostly from checking a few random blocks. What I'd really be interested in is to see whether there's a longer term trend in byte-sizes per transaction; efficiency is important.
Anyway, I like the way that p2sh site presents data, with both line and calendar overviews. Never seen it before, thanks for that.
@_date: 2014-12-21 12:33:26
Thanks for that explanation. But, if I'm understanding this correctly, isn't this going to be a growing problem? Or does a transaction become more efficient again after, say, I combine 10 inputs into one transaction to you; do you then only need one input again for using those coins? I'm not familiar enough with the inner workings, just with the data on average transaction data sizes.
Regardless, if something can be done in matters of efficiency (compression, for example) it should be done. The more data a transaction uses, the less effective increasing block size will be. It doesn't seem like a very elegant solution to just let blocks bloat larger and larger while gaining increasingly fewer transactions per mb you add.

@_date: 2014-12-21 13:06:02
Thanks for explaining that. That's really helpful. 
In terms of the effects of...let's call it fragmentation, I think the maximum decrease in transactions per second (TPS) was probably reached back in around August of 2011, when we first dipped to 4 TPS. For much of 2012 and 2013, TPS ranged between 4-5, being remarkably stable. So I think you're right there, as far as efficiency goes in terms of fragmentation, it's probably not getting any worse. 
It's just that, starting in 2014, maximum TPS has suddenly been going down again. Is this the effect of multi-sig transactions? I'm not against block size increases, it's just that currently we've mostly trended towards transactions using up more data, and if in the future we get other innovations that could potentially also increase transaction data sizes, increasing block size is going to have diminishing returns. It's a two-pronged problem that needs a two-pronged solution.

Gold is an investment doing well in case of economic risks, thus being negatively correlated to economies doing well. Today a whole bunch of economic data turned out to be better than expected, first some better Euro PMI's, and then most importantly US Unemployment claims, which were sitting at 284k, whereas the forecast was around 310k. 
That last piece of news pushed the dollar up, which pushed gold/silver, bonds (because bonds do worse when stocks/the economy do well) and apparently nowadays Bitcoin down. 
I find this interesting because it might indicate that hedge funds are using Bitcoin in the same way as gold, silver, the Swiss Franc; basically, as a safe haven asset. Either that or the Bitcoin movement was complete coincidence which is perfectly possible.

How transparent are your financials, i.e., where does the money you annually receive from corporate as well as individual memberships go? Currently you receive roughly $300.000 to $400.000 in yearly revenue from your sale of corporate memberships, and another $15.000 in annual memberships, as well as a one-time sum of roughly $117.500 in payments for lifetime memberships. Most of the corporate memberships, to be honest, look like you're selling advertising opportunities. Are there criteria for corporate memberships or is the only criteria to join 'being able to pay us lots of money'? 
Your bylaws and the fact that you're a foundation make clear that this is a non-profit organization, yet you don't seem to have any concrete financial plans such as an annual budget to present your costs as well as your allocation of funds.

I think what Bitcoin needs is more efforts on efficiency. 
Transactions are using up increasingly more data. From a maximum of around 8-10 transactions per second in 2010, we've trended downwards to a long-term plateau around 4-5 up till the end of 2013, and recently dipped below 4. From 2014 onwards the network has only been able to sustain roughly 3 transactions per second. 
If this continues, we might dip below 2 transactions per second in 2015. Larger block sizes will probably become a necessity, but we also need Bitcoin transactions to become more efficient.

Though an absence of information is not evidence, there really is very little info about Causevox, Karin Tamerius, or adaywithouttouch.
On Causevox: The person running the campaign pays them per month, either $0, $49 or $129, resulting in additional transaction fees of either 5%, 4.25% or 4%. So that money is basically lost compared to when you'd send it directly to DWB, and the idea then, I guess, is that this campaign has to draw awareness and money that otherwise wouldn't have reached DWB. 
What I really don't like though is that I cannot find any evidence that anything donated to a Causevox campaign site is actually guaranteed to arrive at whatever charity it purports. According to their own site, you do not have to have a [501(c)3]( i.e., a non-profit organization, to start a Causevox campaign, nor is the money disbursed specifically to a charity but might as well be send to [a private person's PayPal or Stripe account]( 
Basically, you have to trust the person running the campaign on Causevox. I'd rather just send money to DWB directly.

...what? How do they make money on margin calls? 
The only way you could make money on that is if you're not actually running an exchange but a bucket shop, ie., if you're basically running an illegal betting ring where none of the orders are actually executed in a market but only noted as bets against the 'house', being the broker.
Otherwise a margin call is just the broker force-closing the position of a client once the client's losses on their leveraged position exceed the amount they have in their deposit. In a real exchange the broker doesn't make a dime on that (well, apart from commissions) because it's the client who lost all his money on the exchange. The broker has to close those positions or else they'd have to pay for their client's losses. 
Can't imagine bucket-shops still operating openly in this day and age, though I guess if they exist anywhere than that'd probably be in Bitcoin-space.

They probably try to do some stuff for Bitcoin, but there sure is a pretty penny going into the Foundation and little to no accountability as to how it is used.
About three months ago, when they launched their new website, I did a quick calculation. Back then, they received roughly $300.000 to $400.000 in yearly revenue from sales of corporate memberships, and another $15.000 in annual memberships, as well as a one-time sum of roughly $117.500 in payments for lifetime memberships.
A lot of those 'memberships' seem little different from advertising.

Out of a total of 17 lines, you use 6-7 lines to start with an analogy. Don't do that with an abstract, it's supposed to be a summary. Keep the anecdotes and analogies for the introduction. 
Currently your flow of ideas is as follows and it's too janky:
- Bebop analogy, patrons 
- Open source is good for businesses
- Open source software developers have trouble with funding
- Bitcoin can help
That actually says extremely little about the premiss of your dissertation, and you basically only introduce the topic in the last sentence of your abstract. That means that there's simply very little to critique because the abstract doesn't elaborate on the argument why and how Bitcoin plays an 'essential role in open source software patronage'.  Crowd-funding (kickstarter) and patronage (patreon) already exists in the traditional payment system. What does Bitcoin offer in this case that fiat doesn't? Going by the title, that's where your focus should be, summarizing your arguments.

Cool. I got two questions. If you can't answer them cause you need to protect your business interest, that's fine. Just some stuff I'm wondering about.
Are you operating at a loss at 1% fees or will this be sustainable? It's a pretty common business model to get market share while in red numbers, but if you can do so while making bank that's pretty impressive. 
Seeing as how you take Bitcoins and deliver money, ever had trouble with Bitcoin volatility? Or is that entirely outside of your business? That is, say a costumer sends you 1 Bitcoin to remit back to the Philippines, I assume that you give him a quote as to how much money will be send back for that 1 Bitcoin? Do you instantly hedge your risks or do the average price swings up/down average out to have no to little effect in the end?

Soros' fundamental insight that the Bank of England overpriced the pound when it first joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism is poorly utilized by this article, like a crutch to make the argument that 'look, currencies and Bitcoin both have an exchange rate!'. As if it means that the exchange rate of the Pound versus other currencies solely depends on whatever the hell a handful of traders decide to do, rather than the information and actual real life events and numbers market participants decide to act on. 
What are the fundamental factors driving Bitcoin? Merchant adoption, general adoption, regulatory decisions, the idea of Bitcoin as a safe haven, etc. Meanwhile, currencies traded on the foreign exchange markets have different and more developed fundamentals, such as GDP numbers and expectations, (un)employment data, Central Bank interest rate decisions, general political events such as whatever happens in Ukraine, debt and Bond sales, etc. 
Bitcoin can, and sometimes does, react to data such as this, but the impact of even highly important global political and economic news items seems muted or absent with Bitcoin. This is most likely because there aren't enough traders trading Bitcoin on the basis of fundamental news and information, and the majority seems to consist of technical speculation, merchant action through Coinbase/BitPay, and perhaps startups acquiring Bitcoins.
Sure, the idea of what something is worth boils down to what traders agree on in the market, whether it's Bitcoin, Pounds, Coffee or T-shirts, but that doesn't mean that all markets are the same, that no price is real, all products and price mechanisms are equal, and everything is possible. Ignoring that prices depend on more than opinion alone is philosophical relativism.

The 10k thing has to do with the way the Winklevoss ETF is currently set up to work. If an broker-dealer or another authorized participant wants to acquire ETF shares for arbitrage reasons, the smallest amount possible is 10,000 Bitcoin, or one 'creation unit', as they are called, which is equal to 50,000 ETF shares according to the filing. 10k Bitcoins is a lot and currently likely to make a splash in any of the Bitcoin markets.
I hope they revise that to a lower number to make arbitrage more fluid and less disruptive. 50,000 is a customary amount, but currently a lower number such as 10,000 shares equal to 2000 Bitcoins would be much more appropriate.

I don't think this is, currently, even possible. To get a £20 note in the UK, through Bitcoin, assuming that you only have Euro's in your mainland back account, you would need the following:
- A Bitcoin ATM that allows you to buy Bitcoin with *Euro's* in the UK
- A Bitcoin ATM that allows you to sell Bitcoin for British Pounds
A lot of Bitcoin ATM's are one-way and only allow you to buy Bitcoin. Furthermore, I couldn't find any information on it, but I doubt these ATM's are made to accept multiple currencies.
Now, even if these requirements are met, the comparison with a normal ATM still isn't going to be pretty. You're basically going to have to wait and pay fees *twice*, first when buying Bitcoin with Euro's, then when selling your Bitcoin for Pounds.

I've seen these crowdfunding 'shares' before and I find them all to be highly shaky and suspect.
As far as I can see from a preliminary read-through, although you're buying a percentage equity, you're not actually getting any dividends on that equity, so there's no real return from that. Furthermore, these shares you would buy aren't actually listed anywhere, so they aren't on any market, thus there is no good way for price discovery, nor any way to reliably sell them. Getting those sales done alone is probably also going to end up costing you, for example for hiring a professional for legal advice and to draw up a transfer of ownership.
Apart from that, this particular case: 
They did a previous investment pool for $5 million, where the company was valued at 28 million quid which was "based on Halsey Minor's track record of building hugely successful businesses on top of new technologies". That's cute but doesn't actually tell me anything about the valuation and its justification. Basically, the 60 million quid figure comes down to 'just trust us'. There is, seriously, not a scrap of evidence as to why the company should be valued at 60 million.
Edit: And a short exploration of [Halsey Minor]( has so far only shown me that's he's very good at blowing away vast fortunes. Not a particularly attractive trait for a CEO.

Yes, especially because the network can't actually handle 420 transactions per minute.

Well, we don't know yet what the actual fee for the Winklevosses' ETF is going to be. But for an ETF it's supposed to be an *expense ratio*, not an *ask whatever you think people are willing to fork over*-ratio. 
To some degree, you can use an expense ratio to determine how efficient a fund is run. If actively managed ETFs and ETFs that cover the stocks of entire countries, heck, continents, can run their funds for under 0.2%, asking more than that might just mean that whoever is managing the ETF isn't very good at managing in the first place or just plain wasteful. And seriously, a Bitcoin trust doesn't need a lot of management compared to say, a leveraged fund, or a total stock index, or an actively managed fund. 
There is, of course, a difference in scale. The 0.05% Vanguard gets on VTI is still an enormous sum. Currently its Net Asset Value is at $42,116,049,225 and 0.15% of that is still $63,174,074, so it's no surprise a relatively tiny Bitcoin ETF will have to ask more, but 2% is honestly an awful lot for an ETF. There are only two ETFs worldwide that ask 2% or more, one of them a sugar fund, and I don't even know wtf the other one does.

Yes and I didn't say it doesn't happen, I was just wondering whether naked short selling already occurs in any of the Bitcoin markets, and what markets you specifically mean. They each come with different solutions. Privately owned markets like Bitstamp or BTC-E are bound to entirely different rules than a Bitcoin ETF, or a Bitcoin gambling site. 
For example, with an ETF you don't really have an option to withdraw and deposit Bitcoins because that's not how ETF's work. And while sites like BTC-E offer the ability to withdraw and deposit Bitcoins, that still doesn't make certain at all whether or not these markets take advantage of their customers, whether the Bitcoin you trade there, is actually there (this would only become apparent once enough withdrawals occur), and whether the owner can just disappear with all the funds. 
In short, regulation is difficult, imperfect, but necessary. 
Also, another solution, only allowing Bitcoin to be traded through blockchain transactions, would make for a horrible market. Current Bitcoin limitations only allow for 7 transactions per second. During high volume hours, this would cause lag for every Bitcoin trader, and would probably also hinder anyone doing ordinary transactions. Also, any exchange that does this wouldn't be able to compete in terms of fees because now either the exchange or you would have to take on the miner fees.

I'm actually a pretty poor person, but recognizing that keeping your money in a sock won't do you much good, I've slowly build up a diversified stock portfolio over the years. It's neither difficult nor expensive nowadays, in fact I only pay a yearly ETF expense fee of around 0.05% and that's it. If you can't beat them, and I surely can't, then why not join them. I've been happily benefiting from rising stock prices for years. 
The very poor, those that actually only have enough money to go from paycheck to paycheck, end up neither benefiting nor losing money in QE, inflation or stock increases. I agree that this is a problem of inequality that also needs to be solved, and I support higher taxes, especially for capital gains. There is no reason why the 1% can't or shouldn't be taxed way more.

So it makes for a good tool for comparing things that are usually on divergent scales, but why is this relevant for Bitcoin? I mean, Bitcoin is the same, not different things. To continue with ants, an ant can apparently easily lift 100x its bodyweight, which would mean for an 80kg human to be equal he would have to lift 800kg, which would be ridiculously impressive. Which means there are other things at play rather than just differences in strength, and comparisons between ants and humans on the log scale only works to a degree.
Why then would the log scale be fitting for Bitcoin? And, in this case, not just any log scale but apparently log 10, which is the scale I've always seen used. If you want to show Bitcoin has been doubling over the years, wouldn't it make more sense to use a log base 2 chart?

Because people keep saying how transaction fees will ultimately replace mining fees. I was writing in BTC because that made for easier numbers, but in terms of dollars, currently we get an inflow of almost $1,000,000 worth of BTC every day through mining. Meanwhile, transaction fees haven't developed anywhere near that, ranging between a daily $5000 to $10,000 for the last years. 
If nothing in particular happens when mining subsidies drop while transaction fees don't catch up, then that's cool. That's basically what I'm asking about, whether transaction fees *have* to increase to replace mining subsidies, and whether anything happens in case they don't.

One currency losing or gaining value against another currency does not equal an equal loss or gain of value of the currency itself, nor of the purchasing power of that currency.
Unless all Euro's you own were held on a Foreign Exchange Market, specifically the EUR/USD pair, or you for some reason need to continuously convert all your Euro's to dollars, then you're unlikely to have lost 17% value in the Euro. 
The most realistic loss in purchasing power would relate to goods imported from the US into the EU, which amounts to roughly 14% of EU imports. Then there's to consider how much of the exchange rate fluctuation importers will (or even are able to) include in the price, and whether retailers will or can raise prices. This depends on the elasticity of the prices of the goods involved. 
Another aspect to consider is whether there could be cheaper suppliers for goods previously imported from the US, which might now be better imported from countries with whom the EU has a more favourable exchange rate, say for example the Japanese Yen which has lately collapsed.
But I guess you could just ignore all that and just take the exchange rate as equal to value. Doesn't really have anything to do with the real world though.

No idea. I suspect the option in this case, KEB bank, might not be very competitive. 
Dedicated services always outperform the jack-of-all-trades type. For example, I know I could use the Dutch bank I have a checking account with as a broker for buying stocks, but they'd fleece me blind for even thinking like that; which is why I'm using a specialised broker instead. Those brokers get much more traffic, thus benefit through scale, and offer cheaper services.
But banks still offer those service because they can and because unsophisticated customers don't know better and just eat the fees. I would guess the same happens in the remittance industry. People prefer to stick with what they know, especially when it comes to money, thus when they have to send money elsewhere, they'll likely stick to where they store their money, their bank. Meanwhile, customers who really need and use remittance often use other, dedicated services that are cheaper, likely faster. Thus, lowering fees in remittance doesn't really increase customers for a bank, nor do the high fees scare away the customers they already have because they don't often use international transfers anyway. 
But I'm not a remittance expert so this is just me offering some thoughts.

Well, is volume actually growing exponentially? Got me curious so I threw some data from blockchain.info on a log chart and that got me this.
Grey line and right vertical axis is volume, left vertical axis is price. While you could argue that volume grew exponentially at the start, it's more questionable during the later years. And that is exactly what I would expect to happen, because you can't just go x10 all the time and expect every x10 change to be the same. With scale, things like liquidity, volume and price change, but those changes are different depending on at what stage of development we're at, they don't just all go x10 constantly in lockstep.
If blockchain.info data isn't adequate, don't just complain but get me a better alternative.

Inflation eats into the value of money you posses. The poor, not having any money, can't lose value of something they don't have. 
The only way inflation would eat up the purchasing power of the poor is if their wages can't keep pace with inflation. To be honest, I'm from Europe, and worker's unions make damn sure that wages don't lag behind inflation. But perhaps that's different in America? Seeing as how labour unions have a tough time existing already and there's a culture going on that more or less prevents increasing the taxes of the 'job creator' class.

Thank you for writing that so I don't have to myself. I fully agree with you.
The sad and somewhat ironic thing is that, the same people who post charts such as in the link at the top, with the intention to use them as proof of the evils of inflation, are also the same people who will then instantly turn around once you use CPI data to show that, had you invested in TIPS, bonds, or a well-diversified portfolio of stocks, inflation would not have been a problem. 
Once you argue that conservative investments outpace inflation, suddenly the same government charts they love to parade around are no longer good enough and they need to grasp for alternative data such as shadowstats, a site that, literally, just makes shit up by adding a constant to the CPI, just to make inflation look higher. It's pitiful.

For me in Europe, withdrawing from a normal ATM costs nothing.
If I withdraw pounds in England with my Euro bank card, that'd cost me €2 + 1%, so on €100 that'd be about 3%. If I don't withdraw but just pay with my card in a foreign country, it's a 1% fee.

With effort I mean the amount of money/Bitcoin required to move a price either up or down. It's really difficult to support this with any data, but I think that the amount of money required to move the price at $1000, say up by 10%, isn't just 10x what was needed to move the price up 10% back when the price was at $100.
Whereas a log chart shows increases of the same percentages as relatively the same, in real numbers there is a vast difference what is possible at one price versus another, and in one market versus another. $10,000 invested when Bitcoin was at $10 on Bitstamp would, on an average day, have accounted for most of the volume of an entire week and an order like that would've been likely to greatly move the price itself. But while the price is roughly 20x as much, around $200 now, an equal investment of $200k would only move the Bitstamp market up by about 5%. Not only are there more exchanges, in more currencies than before, but their depth is also greater, with a larger number of market participants, and arbitrage among exchanges is far more common. 
Furthermore, the human element is lost. In real numbers, $200k is a greatly different sum than $10k. People just don't have endless money, and there is a limited amount of money and interest for Bitcoin at any time. A log chart assumes that each of those increases would be just the same, as if when travelling, an increase in distance from 10 meters to 100 meters is the same as an increase from 10 kilometres to 100 kilometres. Theoretically that might be so, both being an order of 10 greater, but while a decent amount of people is able to run 10km, there are only very few people capable and crazy enough to run 100km. 
I don't know where this...let's call it upper boundary of the plausible starts with Bitcoin, $1000, $10.000, whatever, but a log chart is far too simple an interpretation of it.

If you believe in bogus sites such as Shadowstats, I can't help you. All Shadowstats is doing is taking the CPI data and adding on an arbitrary constant to make it look like inflation is higher. If that's what you prefer to trust, there's no point in arguing with you about inflation/wages/QE because our numbers will just disagree.
About unions, you argue that they can't increase wages enough to keep up with inflation, but at the same time you argue that they raise salaries so much that it destroys industries. So what is it, do they raise wages or not? Or are you trying to argue that industries can only exist by exploiting their workforce?

Sorry that second part of my post has, by accident, become a bit of a trap. Log 2 or log 10, or log 50 or whatever, doesn't really matter much for a chart to be honest, and the result will be visually the same. 
Here's a log 2 chart:
Here's the same chart in log 50:
(edit: volume, as shown in right axis, is log 10 in both cases, just saying)
The only thing that is different is the numbers on the left vertical axis, and that is mostly because Excel just populates the axis based on what log base you use.
I wasn't trying to bait anyone into that, I only remembered that log bases don't matter on a chart once I started using them again. I usually only work with linear charts on my trading platform.
Edit 2: Oh and as a response to the first part; if we're interested in comparing Bitcoin to other stuff, then all these log charts desperately need to start showing other stuff, instead of just Bitcoin.

I can agree with you that neither log nor linear chart gives the full picture but, and this is perhaps a personal experience, I find people are more easily misled by a log chart than a linear chart. It's far easier for that tiny distance at the top of a log chart to make a moon-scenario plausible than it is on a linear chart, even though traversing that distance might require an unrealistic or at least humongous amount of cash inflow. 
Perhaps it's also because I've seen these type of log charts before. Back in the dot-com bubble people used them to proclaim themselves emperor of the world by investing in one stock that would of course easily rise to $1000 from $0.10 and continue onwards forever. I saw them again during the gold/silver bubble of a few years ago which, I'm willing to admit, I got sucked into for a jolly ride up and then partly down. As a disclosure, with Bitcoin I got in somewhere around $100 and exited somewhere just above $1070, simply because that kind of growth had gotten kind of eerily familiar to me.
There is an incredible amount of essentially meaningless nonsense people prefer to just believe in rather than critically examine (for example, most technical analysis of stock charts) and this is something that saddens me. There is a place and role for log charts, but it's not to use them as a sedative of critical thought, conjured only to support a narrative of unceasing growth or to appease fears about one's investment.

Euro drops 40% against US dollar? The guy in the video says 20%, if I calculate it (roughly 1.40 to 1.117) that's also about 20%. I'm not sure where the title of that video is getting 40% from.

No, I mean selling the Bitcoin for dollars. He sends them to pay off loans, so the longer it remains in Bitcoin, the longer the funds remains subject to volatility, the higher the risks. Sure, you can be lucky and profit, but you also run the risk of losing money. It'd be a bit annoying to have to rely on luck for whether you can make a payment or not.

Is there really no cheaper alternative already in South Korea? Cause to me it looks like you get shafted using KEB. $15 fee for transfer, another $12 for local, whatever that means, and then another $20 you can't explain? That's just weird.
Still, it's nice to see what you can do with Bitcoin. However, looks like $15.67 of the savings through Bitcoin came from being lucky with a rising Bitcoin price ($208.72 when you bought, versus $214.63 when you sold). If there isn't a cheaper alternative, and you're always sending roughly $550, Bitcoin would be cheaper as long as you don't get hit with an unlucky price dive of $25 dollars or more. 
How much time does it actually take to get those Bitcoin from your Korbit account into Circle and then locked into a certain price? That's rather vital if you don't want to gamble on volatility.

Thanks for explaining logarithmic scale and giving some examples of its use.
That still doesn't explain why it's fitting to use it with Bitcoin though. The only thing in common between a change from $1 to $10 and a change from $100 to $1000 is a magnitude of 10. If other things equally changed by a magnitude of 10 (volume, liquidity) perhaps there might be a case for log 10 charts, but I've never seen anyone offer any evidence of that. 
I know that, relatively, those moves are equally significant, but that's like saying that it should be equally significant to me whether my monthly salary goes from $1 to $10 or whether it goes from $1000 to $10000. If the context were different (say the first salary was earned in a third world country, the second in Europe) then using a log scale might make sense to compare those two, but I can't think of how this would be the case with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:22:28
If you want a chart that shows %-based change as equal on all levels then you'll have to go with a log chart. That's true.
But that doesn't mean that every price change in Bitcoin on the magnitude of x10 is equal regardless of price, which is the impression that a log chart gives. Or would you argue that going from $150 to $1000+ last time, and doing so another time would require about the same amount of effort? 
That's really my main objection. They give the false impression that a move from $100 to $1000, or $1000 to $10.000, or heck, $100 to $10 for that matter is going to be just as easy or difficult as it was to get from $0.10 to $1. There are plenty of altcoins that also swung around between the $1-$10 range, but that doesn't mean that it's equally likely that they'll go up to $100.

Apart from what Rannasha wrote, which I all agree with, I want to add that fluctuations in currency valuation don't necessarily have an effect on inflation rate or purchasing power like people here love to believe. 
During the last months the Euro went from around $1.40 to around $1.15 in value against the dollar, that's a drop of almost 18%. This was all pretty much the reaction of the market in anticipation of QE, as well as the EU economy being generally shit while the US economy has been improving a lot lately. 
Now, although you can now buy less dollars with your Euro's, that doesn't mean the Euro's people own have necessarily lost an equal amount of value. Only around 14% of the EU's imports are from the US. Then there's to consider how much of the exchange rate fluctuation importers will include in the price, and whether retailers can raise prices. This depends on the elasticity of the prices of the goods involved.
Another aspect to consider is whether there could be cheaper suppliers for goods previously imported from the US, which might now be better imported from countries with whom the EU has a more favourable exchange rate, say for example the Japanese Yen which has lately collapsed.

That might work in the US, but Europe already does a lot of those things. At least where I come from (the Netherlands), university education was not only free for those too poor to pay, but they even get a stipend to pay for living expenses. Health and social workers already have good pay and conditions because that's what their unions have lobbied for. 
That leaves infrastructure, which I don't know enough about. Still, the Dutch are pretty good at megaprojects like the [Delta Works]( to protect against storm flooding, or the [Zuiderzee Works]( to conjure land from sea.

Futures, or futures contracts, are contracts to exchange assets at a future date for a price agreed upon when the contract is made. 
When you buy a futures contract you basically buy the right to sell or buy the underlying asset at a pre-determined price in the future. For example, say I would buy a contract stating that I could buy BTC at $200 for one BTC in a month. If the price plummets to $100 before the end of the month, I would lose money. However, if the price rises to say $300, I could according to the contract buy BTC at $200, and then sell it at the market price to pocket a profit. The same works when selling BTC. This way you can hedge your price, by for example getting into a contract that will allow you to sell BTC in one month for $200; but of course you'll technically lose money if in the future BTC will have gone up in value while you're still contractually obliged to sell cheaper.
It's a more complicated way of trading and I'm not sure how Bitcoin exchanges handle delivery dates, roll-over dates, and a bunch of other technical stuff. If you aren't familiar with futures trading to start with, I wouldn't go and dive into it with Bitcoin.

I'm curious, what happens if the transaction fees don't catch up to replace the block subsidy? 
If I can trust the chart on blockchain.info, then the trend in total transaction fees is mostly flat, especially in the last months where it ranged around 10-15 BTC per day. Conversely, current block subsidies create 3600 BTC per day (it's 25 per 10 minutes, right?). Transaction fees would need to increase about 300000% to replace that subsidy. That doesn't seem like a very realistic goal.

GBP-&gt;BTC-&gt;EUR, or vice versa for me, involves two additional steps that make the whole process more of a hassle.
When I visit the UK, I don't even have to convert my euro's to pounds. I can use my debit card to pay directly, costing me a 1% fee. The Bitcoin alternative involves that I first buy Bitcoin, then convert them to the foreign currency. Even if this would be free, I'll gladly pay 1% in fees just to skip all that.

You don't seem to understand what volatility means in finance and don't really present any arguments with regard to volatility. All you're doing is using one *definition* of the dollar and show that you are unable to define the value of a dollar from that definition.
First of all, economists use a 'basket of goods' to determine inflation and purchasing power. This basket is fairly stable, but it *has* to change with time, because otherwise it would list items nowadays redundant or non-existent, while not listing items that have become common. 
Second, there are other ways to measure the value of the dollar, for example, by comparing it to other currencies. The US Dollar Index, (USDX) keeps track of the value of the dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies for example. 
Finally, whatever metric you use, none will support the idea that Bitcoin, which easily fluctuates by 10% up or down on a day-to-day basis, is less volatile than the US Dollar. For example, the average daily range of the US Dollar versus the Euro is about 100-150 pips, a bit less than a 1% daily range. The same is true with regard to the dollar versus other currencies. Purchasing power, meanwhile, can hardly be analysed on a day-to-day basis, but if Bitcoin can gain a few 100% or 1000% in value in a year, the entire US economy would've had to implode, vanish or quadruple for the dollar to be more volatile than that. 
Just because you're having difficulties measuring the volatility of a currency doesn't mean it's somehow more volatile than Bitcoin.

That is how markets work, every market. Daily, people lose and gain in Forex, commodities, real-estate, stocks. A few people make a living of their profits, even less make a fortune. Whether you gain or lose is entirely up to your own abilities.

These type of war-cries always rear their ugly head when a bubble pops. ‘buy the dip’, ‘temporary retracement’, ‘it’s only a correction’, ‘just hold for the long-term’. Often this is perfectly fine advice while the up-trend holds, but the one time it is wrong can be far more damaging to your wealth.
It's a form of group-think. People delude themselves into thinking that, because other people think similar ways, they are probably more right, and mindlessly follow one another and repeat their soothing mantras. As Charles Mackay (probably the most famous author on bubbles) once said:
"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one."

It's only reasonable if you do it with an amount of money you can afford to lose. I'm afraid a lot of the people who buy Bitcoin do so with far too much of their wealth, not realising or wanting to realise the risk they face in doing so.
Even conservative investment plans have room for something like Bitcoin, but only about 5% of your entire portfolio, tops. Some people call that the 'funny money' part of their account. I've done it myself with Bitcoin, saw my investment go x 10, and then sold when I saw Bitcoin news in every paper, heard people in the streets talk about Bitcoin, and saw Bitcoin news on screens at a metro station.
Buying large quantities of a cryptocurrency is like buying large quantities of a single commodity or a single penny stock. It might go up and make you rich, or it might drop and make you poor. Unless you have a plan, and allocation percentage is one way of planning, you're putting yourself at very large risk if you buy more than you can afford to lose - in any single investment, not just Bitcoin.

Unless you bought so little at $1000 that a steep fall means little, say 1-2% of your wealth, all you're doing with buy-and-hold is to torture yourself. Perhaps Bitcoin will be replaced by another crypto, perhaps large governments decide to ban crypto outright making it impossible to trade it for money, ANYTHING can happen. But there's no room at all for these eventualities in the plans of Bitcoin-crazies, is there. It's all black &amp; white, all-or-nothing, boom-or-bust. That's not the right attitude to make money from speculation. You ARE in this to make money, right?
And let's be generous and assume that Bitcoin goes back to $1000 after an unknown period of time. What have you gained once Bitcoin returns to $1000? $0, nothing, zilch, and all that time you've spent waiting in agony, hoping it won't go down further. Not only that, but you've also cost yourself the opportunity and time value of your money. While the only thing your money in Bitcoin was doing was *regaining* its value, people who invested their money more wisely elsewhere were making a profit.
If you don't even consider the options that Bitcoin might go down more, to say $100, or $10, and perhaps stay there for a prolonged period, if you don't consider what might happen when governments ban Bitcoin, if you don't even *want* to consider all possible outcomes before speculating on the price of Bitcoin, you have absolutely no business doing so and are a danger to your own wealth.

Oh sorry about that. I should've labelled my charts better. The left vertical axis shows number of transactions, so the blue stuff is the daily number of transactions, not the value of the average daily transaction. 
But you make a very valid point and I should've also looked at what size the daily average transaction is. Luckily, blockchain.info has all the data to calculate it from (total daily transaction size in USD divided by total daily amount of transactions), so I've gone and made a chart based on that data. 
It looks like transaction size is indeed a big factor, but the annoying thing is that based on that chart alone I can't conclude whether rising fees is mostly because of larg(er) transaction sizes or whether it is because Bitcoin gets more expensive and thus all fees go up. Correlation on a chart is not the same as causation.
As usual with these things, it's probably a mixture of both factors. To get conclusive I would need to know how large fees are on average for transactions in certain ranges, say below 1 dollar, and then upwards until I've got a complete picture.
If there's an easy way to get that data I might give it a shot, but I don't think blockchain.info is that detailed.

Just because prices fluctuate doesn't mean you can't use the dollar as a way to compare prices and values, just that it is more difficult. 
You proposed to instead use gold as a way to compare Bitcoin price. But even the price of Gold fluctuates, heavily in fact, it is quite volatile. Gold lost roughly 35% of its value, or 600 dollars, during the last 2 years. To assume that this is not a fluctuation in gold, but that gold is stable and that instead the dollar fluctuated, makes no sense. Under that assumption the dollar would have gained 35% in value over the last years.
Nothing in this world has a stable value, but some things, like currencies, are under most situations more stable than other things, such as stocks, commodities, or Bitcoin.

If you're in the US, a fair enough reason to accept Bitcoin would be to save on transaction costs. PayPal asks around 3% of each transaction + 30 cents, BitPay meanwhile asks 1% or a monthly fee of $30. Through BitPay it's pretty much the same as though you're accepting dollars because you'll never directly touch Bitcoin unless you want to.
I wouldn't recommend holding Bitcoin as a merchant. It's most likely a huge hassle for taxes, and as a business you really don't want to run volatility risks and see 30-50% swings in your profit. If you want to speculate, do that outside of your business ledger with your own money.
If you're in Europe or the UK, I wouldn't recommend Bitcoin at all. BitPay doesn't offer a good enough exchange rate for Euros and Pounds because Bitcoins aren't traded heavily in those currencies, so they have to protect themselves from exchange risk by paying less for Bitcoin in Euros than they are worth. As a merchant you wouldn't notice much of that in the end, but it's not good business practice to offer a payment service that costs your customer an additional 10% to 15% depending on how the exchanges trade at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:55:02
To the user there really isn't that much benefit in using Bitcoin versus PayPal when paying for things. In fact, being able to chargeback through PayPal is a really nice option to have in case something goes wrong or the seller is trying to scam you.
The possible improvement Bitcoin offers is that the store might save some money on transaction costs. I haven't looked into PayPal costs for merchants, but a lot of other payment options carry fees that are higher than what you'd have to pay in miner-fees with Bitcoin, although the mining fees seem to have gotten higher lately as well.
To a costumer this would only matter in case merchants offer you a discount in case you're using a payment system that is cheaper to them. On the grand-scale, perhaps Bitcoin will push other payment systems like PayPal and credit cards to reduce their fees to remain competitive, which is a good development.
