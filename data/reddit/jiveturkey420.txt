I tried A-PHP once. It's some serious shit. Pretty much turbo-crack. Smoked one pipe, i wanna say around 60mg , took some etizolam to mellow it out and I was off to the stimulant psychosis races. Didn't stop until the bag was fucking empty. I kept meticulous records of every dose I took and it was basically every half hour for 3-days.
At one point I just came to standing in front of my desk and realized I had lost 12 hours. I was awake. There was dose after dose recorded in my journal. I never left the spot. No internet history. No signs of a furious stim fueled jerkoff.  Just 12 hours conscious, with no signs of any mental activity other than consistent redosing.
Fuck that stuff so hard. I was never in to those types of drugs and only had it around because a friend was asking about it and I had some morbid curiosity. In retrospect it's like I was possessed for the time on it. Just rapes your reward systems.
This shit is pure psychosis fuel and it explains a lot of why Macafee is so weird now but i doubt he still does it. Those kind of stims become so violently destructive so fast when there are large amounts, most people learn not to do that pretty fast.
Also don't give him credit for synthesizing some rare exotic chemical. It was one of the most common "bath salt" grade stimulants being mass produced for export from China at the time. He probably hired a Chinese lab and paid to let him document the process. He didn't resurrect some magic hippy-era academic stimulant.
