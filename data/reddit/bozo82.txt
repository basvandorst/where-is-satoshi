Would it be an investment if I buy oranges with dollars?  
I think we need to define investing.  
In any case this is what I do, I keep x amount of bitcoin on hand, when I want to buy something I buy it with bitcoin and then rebuy the amount that I spent from coinbase... I don't see that as investing, but I might be wrong. In the mean time I am storing x amount worth of 'value' in bitcoin and I dont particularly care for it to increase in value (although would not mind), and I don't get too sad when value is decreased

Thank you all that participated.  
So to summarize, my takeaway from this thread seems to be that people span a spectrum from:  
-moderately in support of bitcoin and seeming not to like it at times depending on the context.  
-against bitcoin and trying to educate/warn others and or wanting to be able to say 'I told you so' later.  
-paid by government agencies? (a bit controversial, but trying to be objective, this is a separate category and there's at least one comment such as 'I am being paid by xyz')

When I saw this I thought that this might be due to transaction malleability issue.  Maybe blockchain.info does not broadcast transactions which have unconfirmed inputs until those inputs are confirmed, but still shows those transactions.

Buy whatever amount in $ you are comfortable with losing and pretend like that money is already lost. Do not panic sell, the price usually bounces back. And have fun with it, go to local stores that accept bitcoin, buy gift cards though gyft.com etc.

Define invest, do you mean speculate? If you mean speculate then I agree.  
Bitcoin is a currency, if I get paid in USD would you say I am investing in USD. So when I buy bitcoin I am simply storing value in bitcoin, granted that is a but risky, nevertheless it's something I enjoy doing...

He probably meant that behind the scenes accounting was not done using the blockchain. Thus 'taking funds off the blockchain'.  
Look at the leaked database, their database says that Gox still got 950k coins, which does not correspond to the number of coins in the addresses that Gox controls, if Gox did not take their fund off the blockchain they would have noticed the whatever issue they were having that caused them to 'misplace' all those coins before all the coins were gone.

[coinbase.com]( if you are in US.  
1. open a separate checking account specifically for buying bitcoins  
2. link checking account to coinbase (takes about 4 days to verify)  
3. buy bitcoin  
4. go to local stores that accept bitcoin, shop on tigerdirect or overstock, etc.

Good for them.  
Should save this article for every time I hear that bitcoin is only used to launder money...
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:30:56
so someone should probably report this to blockchain.info...

This probably does not generalize to the rest of the banking system... but pretty ridiculous for BofA non the less.
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:53:33
So this is extortion right?
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:01:48
Even if someone is willing to give you $500 for it?

This is the post.

If the bitcoins can be added back to your balance by blockchain.info then that means that the original transaction was never propagated to the rest of the network and nothing to worry about. Anyone you would have paid with the original transaction would not have seen it, it never left the blockchain.info server.

So what is the scenario here, you send one transaction to the merchant and a different transaction spending the same inputs to all the miners?  
This is possible, but a merchant should not advertise her IP address exactly for this reason, a merchant should ideally be connected to multiple nodes that are not also miners, and maybe also use a service which detects double spends.  
So in this case an attacker would have to send the 'bad' transaction directly to the miners and the 'good' transaction to a random node and hope that the 'good' transaction reaches the merchant first and that the 'bad' transaction would not be detected as a double spend, this is unlikely since it takes 5~10 seconds for transactions to propagate through the network, meaning that a double spend would be detected in a worst case scenario in 5~10 seconds.

Thats a pretty good deal I think...

Some banks have been known to not play nice with bitcoin. So to be on the safe side open a different checking account in a different bank. From memory, don't quote me on this, I think some people got their accounts closed/frozen because they were buying/selling bitcoin...

Why should he take personal responsibility, banks are regulated right? And regulation means that the government will make everything ok and consumers don't have to worry about a thing...
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:57:55
Nope.

Whats this about Albanian men selling leks, anyone know what she is talking about?

What really gets me is fractional reserve banking, creating money out of thin air...  
Also money as debt, every dollar in existence is owed to someone else, the only way to keep the show going is to borrow more...  
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:26:56
Why do you want to buy from mobile?  
As far as I know there is no way to do that specifically but if you want to elaborate as to what you are trying to achieve people might be able to offer an alternative.

And fiat offers 3% (inflation) negative interest a year...

What about that one senator guy who wanted to ban it, I think they are paying some attention.

This should have been the text up top imo.  
You are trying to say 'be active in your community' I think.  
If bitcoin detractors are more active than bitcoin supporters in the bitcoin community, bitcoin will have a bad time.
