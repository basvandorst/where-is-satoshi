Probably with exploitation and a lot of blood unfortunately.

Yah it would mean a catastrophe with the current chain... It's not in the plans but if we fuck up the battle is not lost.

I really want to get into doing this but there isn't much arround me that accepts crpto. And lets be honnest. The bitcoin fee's right now are too damn high!

I was thinking about this the other day. If I put all of my regular income into bitcoin and have a cushion in FIAT. I could buy things like coffee using what would normally be my functional income which would not be going into bitcoin for me to hodl anyways. Basically aby transactions made that isn't with my disposable income would be the equivalent of a cash transaction in value and we would be encouraging the ecosystem to grow.

I did the same, I traded about half of my holdings for ETH since it seems to be finally picking up and bitcoin scaling is an issue. It definitely hurts a little bit to see these numbers, guess I underestimated the power of bitcoin's mass appeal and brand name allowing it still to steadily climb. 
Despite the worrying, I still think it could be a good strategy since I am still hodling a decent amount in bitcoin which I'm now resolved to not trading. Also if ETH picks up, given it's lower valuation... it could grow a lot faster than bitcoin in the near future.

Omfg I didn't think he would go through with it. Now I feel disgusted in myself for encouraging it. But could we really know he was actually going to do it. Wtf OP

Save the block chain presentation for later... There are more important subjects to cover first!
