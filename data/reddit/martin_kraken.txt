The guy was selling them 10% under the current exchange rate, quick bucks, I also borrowed money for it, he transferred directly to my kraken account, with this rate what we have easy 1k eur profit plus exchange rate appreciation in past 24hours. Usually I am sitting there and buying 2-3k worth, this time did 10k, but after this I don't know if it's safe anymore. Maybe anything over 5000eur is monitored ? I don't know, maybe someone from kraken can elaborate ?

not laundering, just took opportunity to make money, btw very good points about fungibility, let's hope next updates will fix it and we will not need to use another coins

But they don't respond at official support channels, nothing, just ignore, I don't know what should I do :(((((((((

Billy, brother, believe me this is just last option for me. I would not do this, but I messaged 4 emails to kraken support, no answer. I needed to borrow money to be able to buy these coins and now they locked me out and I have everything inside, 10000 eur and rate is going down........sorry yes I panic, i am not very good trader :(((( but this time I can do profit, but i am locked out 
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:16:25
u/kraken-thomas , I sent you ticket number 2 hours ago ! no response ! nowhere nothing, silence !!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:03:12
I don't know, I will create new thread every 8 hours, until it's solved, i need to return some of these money next week, this is just unacceptable behaviour from exchange. Locked out without a reason. 10000 eur inside, support ignoring reddit, ignoring email. Thats just unbelievable what I see here

1. I bought btc yesterday in our coffeeshop as usual I do all deals there, I don't care about bitcoin background ??? How can I know bitcoin background ? Since when we are tainting coins ? Which bitcoins are clean ? Which are dirty ? Tell me
2.No, no single shit givven, no email from kraken at all, just Account Disabled. Period.
3.I did bitcoin deposit, not eur deposit, I dont think that my govt is suspecting something ? My bank account is fine.
4.Yes, it would be f........ GREAT to know reason for me too, 9hours, counting

UPDATE , after 10 hours got first email :
We noticed odd activity on your account, and we froze it as a result. I've re-enabled the account. You can trade again.
I've locked your withdrawals for the time being while we further investigate activity on the account.
Kraken Client Engagement
So they at least allow me to trade, I can see my bitcoins in account, so all good, just cant withdrawn them, let's see for how long
