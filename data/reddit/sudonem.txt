I’m not familiar with coinmama specifically so I really recommend that you do some research and read as many reviews as you can find. 
Also make a point to review the fee schedule on their site closely because it appears that all told you’ll be paying 10.5% in fees to use a credit/debit card. 
Also, just an FYI, lots of credit card companies and a few major banks are banning the purchase of BTC with their accounts so you may actually not have the option to use a credit/debit card. 
All of these sites take their cut one way or another. I’d generally advise not using a credit/debit card unless it’s absolutely essentially that you have BTC in your account ASAP because you pay dearly for that convenience. 
Coinbase is recommended often because it’s he easiest way to get going for beginners and it’s well established. 
Good luck!

To be fair, you couldn’t buy a ticket to Consensus with Bitcoin either.

Bank transfer through Coinbase is dead simple. The only drawback is that it’ll take a few days for the transfer to complete, but that’s normal for bank transfer purchases. Some are longer than others.

Yeah. I actually went to the registration page to confirm. Bizarre.

Yes, but the fee is much higher than if you were to do a banking account transfer. (1.49% via bank transfer vs 3.99% with a debit card).

I have no idea. Sorry.
