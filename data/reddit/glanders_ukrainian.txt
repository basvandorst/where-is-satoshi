Thanks for the suggestion. As for deleting the post, I might. For now I removed the part to easily identify the block and txs.
Edit: I sent slushpool a message signed with the private key from the main CPFP spending address. This should prevent other people from trying to claim it was them.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:09:11
I will. I hadn't noticed it was slushpool until you pointed it out. Even if I don't get a refund, it does make me feel better that one of the good pools mined it.

Oh yes, in the next block. In the few minutes before a block was mined, I was in a panic/bargaining phase trying to use RBF to *reduce* the fee, even knowing that's not how RBF works.

Yes. And that's a feature. In the end, this may actually *be* good news.

The conflict has been brutal and I know you've been attacked a lot. But, honestly, taking the approach of forking with merge mining and replay protection would be acceptable to many people. Neither side should be forced to walk along a path they don't agree with.

Yes, his letters seemed to have made quite an impression.

To avoid arbitrary units, we can consider satoshis vs. atoms of gold. Based on rough calculations, it looks like 1 satoshi buys 926 trillion atoms of gold. So hold onto those satoshis!
Edit to add: If the gold price stays the same and bitcoin reaches $1225, then 1 satoshi will equal 1 quadrillion atoms of gold.

Heh. I do too. Looks like the account of our new improved Stolfi got suspended though. It's too bad, though not a surprise.
If you read this -- I looked at your post history before it was suspended. Well played. :)

Too soon, man.

Sorry you're having a difficult time with txs. I've been there too.
How many unconfirmed txs do you have? Feel free to PM me all the txids. For those where there is a change output (like the two you posted), I can handcraft a tx spending all the change outputs to one of your addresses, minus a large miner fee. (The two you posted had a "low" fee of 50 satoshis per byte, so the CPFP tx would need to have a high enough fee that the average fee becomes something reasonable.) After handcrafting the tx, you could (probably) sign it in electrum and one of us could broadcast it.
I can't do it right now, but if you PM me all the txids and tell me the corresponding change address for each one, I should be able to handcraft the CPFP tx within a day or two.

Nice site. I asked for "fuck" and they threw in the "U" for free:
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:19:19
No hurry. There's always a chance you'll get lucky and your original txs will be confirmed by Saturday!
Edit on Sunday: Well, looks like you did get lucky. I just checked and they've confirmed without needing to do CPFP. Congratulations!

Here's an unsigned CPFP tx that will bump the fee up to 200 spb:
    0100000002b0e2e337332d67c1b9c6bcb384a5c1b6bf7c350c792dd62d54c25d3fc981e6e40000000000ffffffffe7a0716d533d60d8803f4c179d4ccfb0e209ae6861109ee42818502e6f7b9b120000000000ffffffff01a0860100000000001976a914894dff84d5cf3cf3ffc33ad36b46a571a5fd4f3788ac00000000
Unfortunately, I can't advise you on signing it with Electrum. Although there is a signtransaction command in the Electrum console, I couldn't get it to work. Here's how I would sign it:
Use Electrum to export your private keys (Wallet -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Export). Start Bitcoin Core (no need to download the blockchain though!) Go to Help -&gt; Debug Window -&gt; Console. In the console do this if you want to doublecheck the tx:
    decoderawtransaction 0100000002b0e2e337332d67c1b9c6bcb384a5c1b6bf7c350c792dd62d54c25d3fc981e6e40000000000ffffffffe7a0716d533d60d8803f4c179d4ccfb0e209ae6861109ee42818502e6f7b9b120000000000ffffffff01a0860100000000001976a914894dff84d5cf3cf3ffc33ad36b46a571a5fd4f3788ac00000000
It spends the two change outputs from your two txs to give just 0.001 bitcoins to one of your change address. Once you've doublechecked this, sign it like this:
    signrawtransaction 0100000002b0e2e337332d67c1b9c6bcb384a5c1b6bf7c350c792dd62d54c25d3fc981e6e40000000000ffffffffe7a0716d533d60d8803f4c179d4ccfb0e209ae6861109ee42818502e6f7b9b120000000000ffffffff01a0860100000000001976a914894dff84d5cf3cf3ffc33ad36b46a571a5fd4f3788ac00000000 [] '["&lt;privatekey1&gt;","&lt;privatekey2&gt;"]'
This should give you a long hex string. Post it here and I'll send it for you. Or you can push it via, e.g., blockchain.info/pushtx
If you want to make it easier, just PM me the private keys for the addresses 1DX11gk1ZiBLXfp4wxFyDQy44rBs1y7yMN and 1CDMr5rbBkzrQr3BMPpiuPmop88XaiFE5G after you export them from electrum. Then I'll do it. Ordinarily you shouldn't share your private key, but these addresses together hold less than 0.004 bitcoins so it's not terribly risky.
