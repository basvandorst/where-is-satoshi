The fact that you brought up Mt Gox is interesting, one of them asked me about 'all of those people that had their bitcoin hacked from their wallets'. I'm definitely going to have to explain that there is a difference between an IOU on an exchange and actually posessing private keys!Not sure about a quick guide on ethereum however, although I'd absolutely love to talk about it.

I think the fact that we don't actually know who he/she is helps strengthen community consensus. It brings forward the opportunity for anybody to contribute to the project without seeking a 'higher authority' in the form of SN.

Thanks, that site by Jameson Lopp is brilliant. I'm only going to have ten minutes so really have to condense things. Unfortunately these are guys that have the attitude 'it's going to fail/it's not real/it will never replace money' so it's an uphill battle..They're all old engineers and investors that have no idea what the blockchain is, and I'm thinking given my time constraints I'm just going to have to focus on use cases and \-briefly\- touch on blockchain so I don't scare them. I'm known as the guy in the office that's 'out there' so I don't want to scare them off. I'm probably going to present something about the use in Venezuela also, just trying to find some good resources that explore what's going on over there with BTC.

Can this be contested under British law or is it set in stone for a certain amount of time? I'm just wondering if this is allowed how long until it happens in other countries..

This is such a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water. The Petro is complete junk in comparison to even the most scammy cryptos.
