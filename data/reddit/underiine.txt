legal action will be taken for damages caused.

Ver isnt that stupid, he can just buy at a better ratio off the open market, currently its at 1:4 BCC/BTU
Loaded is not offering fair terms. Likely he would dump his "40K BTU "  for a few dollars each after the fork.
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:18:30
previously was .25 for BTU.

hearn quit due to roadblocks. its not surprising that others are also.

except they didnt. the delusional left wants you to believe this because it fits their narrative. 
"Everyone" voted for hillary but no one voted for trump... Sometimes the truth gets in their way...

fud right here.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:21:45
better idea, Ver should sell his bitcoins for FIAT, then buy BTU with his money when everyone panic dumps their BTU.
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:18:12
wtf is that shit. no just no...
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:36:06
sounds like something trump would say.
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:00:32
so FUD based on nothing. I wonder how many bugs core has that hackers will exploit...
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:35:59
could just be an increase in sellers. not necessarily new buyers.

I dont think he gets to decide what miners will do.
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:19:30
ddosing a few nodes wont do shit.
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:50:08
so we shouldnt accept a few miners opinions but should believe a couple of opposing guys cause  /s
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:09:38
its not about just odds of survival, its about market price as well, if there is a 100% chance of survival but a price below current pricing, then the offer isnt fair value.
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:14:19
hyperventilating because miners are going to fork. just STFU and let them.
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:51:00
sell on localbitcoins for cash to traders who then resell it on exchanges. Its actually a good way to anonymously cash out without KYC. So not a sign of adoption. It could very well be arbitragers, not necessarily new users buying.

"attack" . na. if they get majority it "is" the real deal and the minority is the attack.
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:18:40
l0l if you cant beat them , hack them.
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:00:37
this is ok but BU isnt. hypocritical much.
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:58:25
seems to be an issue. multisig is required or eventually they will hit a jackpot.
@_date: 2017-04-04 08:13:35
make your own private ledger and appease yourself if you dont like the "mob" of users.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:57:29
show proof.
