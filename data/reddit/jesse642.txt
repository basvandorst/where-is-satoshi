Who mined the first block? Was it the CIA? Was it mined in America? Do they have a backdoor key to fuck us just when we thought we were good and roll out their new and improved currency that we will all be forced to use? Is this why we don't know who "satoshi nakamoto" Is?

Lul that's a terrible deal bruh if I wanted to pay 15% fees id buy off a big daddy btc atm, the highest fucking fees possible is what your offering. 
I sell my big daddy btc into Canadian dollary doos on quadrigacx. Find an exchange that supports your country's bank and sell your big daddy on there. I pay 1.5% fees when I buy or sell

I'm pretty sure you can use credit card ?
I work away and will be away for the next few weeks. I do not have another piece of photo ID so I will not be able to complete my registration until I am back home.
I bit the bullet and bought a btc from an atm in victoria bc. The fees were pretty huge, $450cad atm fee for a btc when they were $5000cad. So almost a 10% fee which is pretty huge.
I now use coinbase but it's annoying because my limit is $250cad a week and the fees are 4%. I am also actively looking for a secure place with low fees to buy btc, preferably instantly, that is good for Canadian users. If you find something promising, let me know as well and I will comment if I find anything.

Nice , I will check that out. I'm still away at work for another week so I havnt been able to set anything up yet . I was hoping gdax would work but I am now thinking I should probably get a Canadian $ account for ease of use.
How is Gemini working for you?

Gdax.  I'm currently working on setting up an account but once your verified I'm pretty sure there is 0% fees on purchasing bit coin .
