I knew you would stalk the crap out of an account lol, good job ;)

Have you done it? How much do you think it would cost me for 1 BTC plus it's fees

Dwolla's asking for a License ID and stuff like that, I was wondering which one has the closest to a plain transaction off a debit or paycheck

Is [Bitfloor](bitfloor.com) an up and rising competitor to bitinstant? They offer free cash deposits at banks but I wonder how that works, what about debit accounts?

How is it the most expensive? At what point do they charge the 'most expensive' part, is it in between receiving my code to enter online?
So it's basically
- Go to bitcoin
- Request x amount of dollars
- Walk to nearest CVS or 7-11 with 'Money Gram' machine
- Enter code from email
- Pay USD, withdraw receipt with code for said Bitcoins
- Profit...??
And I mean, where can I see how much x BTC is at Bitfloor, doesn't seem to say it in the requesting process, whelp

Great! Thank you so much, I'm coming to more understandable terms asking great redditors my lowly newb questions ;'D -- Hold on, are there fees in between? Does this process (chase process) charge much fees as other sites do? (like this one website which offers Paypal-USD for Bitcoins)
And what do I exactly tell a chase employee? I don't want to sound weird... 'Hi I want to transfer real money for a bitcoin..??' I have Chase as well for my debit account.
Can't I do that in the website? Saying as it is bitfloor's account? Still a little confused ;d

Thanks for the reply and at what large fees have you heard that BitInstant follows through from? I've been looking into their fee's, ranges between 1-5%
What is Mt. Gox...?
@_date: 2012-07-27 03:56:54
Thanks so much! I'm just really trying to find the most simplest way of acquiring BTCs in exchange for USD, sure lower rates help but does Mt. Gox have a process as simple as Paypal exchange? (Paypal I heard, is really anal about this bizz)

Why? I'm honestly interested about bitcoin and have heard that I can buy games etc... At a probably lower price? I'm just really confused how converting money to btc does, and don't even get me started at mining (I understand what it is)

SSN? I really just want to get it over with and get BTC's in any easy process, I can go as far as using a debit account but that's all
