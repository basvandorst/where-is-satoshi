Ummm.. no. 
Family knows of no friends' of son who don't need money or a new car for $5k? You always help friends and fam first.
Rich enough to throw away $35,000 for $5000 of bitcoin.. math doesn't work. So he's paying 7x for bitcoin.
Wealthy ppl don't think like that.
Why not just sell at fair market value and buy bitcoin with proceeds?
Wait till u see the scams when bitcoin hits $33,000 next year.
Crypto is disrupting Money itself. There's nothing bigger than money

..including tanking Satoshi's own $100M net worth in Bitcoins? I don't think so

So let me try and get this straight.  A bank is going out of business unless the Fed loans them $X billion or triliion for one day and they pay back the loan in full with interest in one day and are all set back in business?

Awesome. That said.. in ten years, if all goes to plan.. Bitcoin at $1007 might feel like $4

"An approved ETF would make bitcoin investing simple for small traders and institutions, while potentially boosting the digital currency just as it’s hitting new highs almost daily. Some $300 million could pour into a bitcoin ETF in its first week, Spencer Bogart, head of research at venture-capital investor Blockchain Capital, said in an interview.."

let's not forget that about 2500 Metric Tons of gold is still mined every year at a current-day value of around $85,000,000,000. Added every year. Not exactly precious. 
Gold Market Cap roughly $8T
Bitcoin Market Cap about $20B
I enjoy both. To the moon!

Very cool. Gentle reminder: March 10: Winklevoss EFT SEC decision, if passed, bitcoins value could go up 10-30%, if not, down the same. Enjoy!

What's most probable: GDAX does not want active traders because they are market takers. We'll go elsewhere. Coinbase and GDAX wants one's and two's investors, moms and pops to buy in. 
Why? Cash.

@_date: 2016-12-31 14:50:18
Thanks. We're at the third major top this year and up $325 since Oct 21, I am out until it settles back down to about $835

Interesting. The difference or advantage is that Bitcoin is global. 
Did some math this morning; for Bitcoin to have a $100B market cap, currently at $12B, given 16M coins in circulation a single bitcoin would be worth $6,250.
To put that $100B market cap in perspective, at least compared to gold, about 2500 metric tons of gold is mined every year, at todays rate thats over $90B / yr., with total known world mined gold value around $7T.. so $100B doesn't really sound that unrealistic. I think it will go much further.

I read a stat that said only about half the people on this planet use banks. But they do have or have access to cell phones.
Another: only something like 3% of Indians have bank accounts, 97% use all cash.

TA is about probabilities, not predicting absolutes
After about 2 years of reading charts properly for 12 hrs a day, you might get it, if you're good at visual math
best traders ITW only get it right about 60% of the time

James D'Angelo does it best for me, he's an MIT Electrical Engineer who worked for NASA. He know his stuff and his blackboard lessons are terrific learning sessions.

Wouldn't it be a catch-22 in the sense that if government can tax xCoin it would actually drive the value up, while at the same time be competing with government currency?

Nope, he's just that awesome a person I sometimes include his age because I am so proud of him and feel very fortunate.

3.5 billion people do not use or have access to banking. Source: James D'Angelo, The World Bitcoin Network on YouTube. His videos on the subject are fantastic. Simple, technical, easy to digest.

Is that Reeds Law? The assertion by David Reed that the utility of large social networks can scale exponentially with the size of the network?

The value of what was fought for and won 100 years ago has diminished to near bupkis because the rate of pay has not kept up with inflation and the cost of living. 
The problem is that in most cases all profits go to the corporation rather than a percentage shared with workers. 
The minimum wage should be around $22 given inflation and cost of living.
