I'd imagine the wallet app initializes by connecting to some big node for a fee, where the user is given the option to say no, change node, etc. After that, it functions like a normal wallet and chooses to send Btc via Lightning whenever possible

The money got my attention, the technology made me interested.

Afaik there are only 3 people that have access to merge code to the master branch of Bitcoin Core. How are they "elected" and who gets to "elect"?

I donate some millibits to various BTC-related projects I like
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:56:42
A years membership in the Norwegian Bitcoin and Blockchain organization

I would donate some millibits

Let's say LN is a thing and all my neighbors use it on Bitcoin. And our local grocery store here as well. Since I'm the early adopting geek among my neighbors, I may be the first one to open opp a channel with the local grocery store. I open it, it costs a transaction on the blockchain. But I choose to keep it open for a year or so. I do my normal shopping there every other day(and pay practically nothing in tx fees). A few weeks later, one of my neighbors chooses to do the same. Now we both have a payment channel open with the grocery store. Now, my neighbor and I can send Bitcoins between the two of us instantly and practically for free, multiple times a second if necessary, via our grocery store. The blockchain doesn't need to know. This was just a small and perhaps not the best example, but just try to imagine not three parties, but millions. If you have a channel with someone who has other channels open and so on, you will likely reach anyone on the planet. Kind of like how everyone knows everyone just by going 7-8(?) hops. Or how internet routing works.

I sent a tx with 100 sat/B with Samourai today, only took ~3 hours and ~5$. Just press the fee number in Samourai, not the button that cycles through low/normal/priority.

You're gonna need more than an hour. A few weeks of binging and reading should give you a good overview.

Price should not matter if you believe in Bitcoin imo
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:00:43
I'm already running a full 15.1 node, will look into running a mainnet lightning node with some funds I'm willing to sacrifice during testing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:02:01
Isn't that why Bitcoin uses Ripemd-160 as well as SHA256? In case either have a back door
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:53:33
This is why blocks should be as small as possible ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:52:57
I got it too, really great book ��
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:59:05
The Internet of Money is pretty much the "why" of Bitcoin, Mastering Bitcoin is the "how". Order doesn't matter imo.

Save this ( HTML page on a usb stick formatted as something Linux understands. FAT32 or something. Then create another USB stick with a bootable Linux distro. Newest Ubuntu desktop should be fine. Plug both sticks into a computer, disconnect all hard drives and ethernet cables and boot from the Linux stick. "Try Ubuntu" or something should show up. Get to the desktop, DO NOT CONNECT TO ANY NETWORK. Connect to a stupid old printer via USB. Open the HTML page in Firefox, create the paper wallet(s) and print them. Disconnect and shut down everything, format all sticks involved in this thoroughly. Maybe even destroy the printer. All  this should yield safely generated paper wallets.

I think of it as gold I can transfer over the internet.

Which block?

Bottled water, via Lightning in Oslo, Norway of all places
@_date: 2018-05-02 05:24:50
Link? In Norway we rarely use cash, so I like converting the cash I sometimes do get into Bitcoin. Just to play with Lightning, donations and stuff. ATMs are great for those kind of of purchases, and in general for awareness.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:30:53
I put mine on my work laptop, so other people can see it daily ��
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:45:15
Ah yes, they're not newbie friendly. They're great if you understand how a Bitcoin wallet works and have some spare cash though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

As a guy who works in IT, this both excites and disgusts me.

I see lots of people using fanny packs, but they're usually hanging across the chest from the shoulder. Looks a bit silly, but is practical I guess.

Help me understand: How does this help if B2X has most of the hashing power and can spin up their own nodes in AWS?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:19:17
Yeah, but why 2 weeks?

What if Trezor goes out of business? Can the seed be used somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:58:56
Get your bitcoin off the exchanges asap. The whole point of bitcoin is to be in control of your own money.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:34:27
If your electricity would go to heating even if you were not mining, mining would not be wasted electricity.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:14:58
If you live in Oslo, you can take a trip to Kiellands Hus, there is an ATM there for quick and easy bitcoin purchases. Quite expensive though, i think about 15% extra. But convenient and anonymous ��

What's the point of a closed blockchain?

Why 2016?
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:50:16
USB-C all the things :-) 
It's mostly a matter of principle, just trying to phase outdated connectors out of my life.

Let's say I have a paper wallet with some bitcoins in my safe deposit box. Can I in 10 years still use the bitcoins associated with the paper wallet? What about these "forks" I barely understand?
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:50:29
Hypothetically what would happen if all ISP's block port 8333?
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:43:11
I do
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:55:46
I mine a little bit, enough to "make" about 1USD worth every week. It probably costs more than that in electricity, but I live in a cold area with electrical heating, so it doesn't really make a difference in the winter. My random hardware get used, I learn something, and get a little bitcoin in the process.
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:09:56
I do this when i sell stuff to people. I usually give 50% off, to motivate the buyer to get into Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:05:42
Where are the others?
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:32:31
Nope. Norwegians can read more about it here:

Bitcoin just needs a "Steve Jobs" to make this tech available and understandable for everyone.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:52:19
I dont even have a proper gpu ��
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:08:09
Only if you mine

You could try the thing I made: 
I have not tested it since though, I do not know if it works anymore. Things move fast in this space ��

I'm working on a script that automates the whole setup process on Windows. Will post in this sub when I feel it's ready :-)

I thought Docker was for short-lived and/or disposable application instances, how would a lightning node benefit from Docker?
