Hehe I don't want it either, just could be used as the rescue line for the super powers that be to get out of the impending dept collapse..a nice little reset button for them.....just a fear that popped into my head recently :P

There is no story, I started my account around six days ago, while reading about Bitcoin, browsed over into other places, posted in a thread read their rules which it broke, though still getting votes, so I deleted it from my profile menu, my mistake for not following a random persons value system for what makes a "new" account in their mind my mistake.....Lol!
Not to mention you defaulting to being a prying jerk to someone over the internet and demanding details you have no right to be demanding after defaulting to being a jerk hiding behind a blanket of anonymity.
I am legitimately just starting out on reddit as a whole. Account created 6 days ago, my first real thread thanking this sub reddit for introducing me to the wonders of reddit believing that maybe maybe it wouldn't instantly inundated with the indecency of most of the human race of today, and maybe a bit of civility, I was sadly mistaken. go back to defaulting on the internet to a suspicious jerk it will help you in life and make you feel big and tough im done with this crap and the silly waste of time to even deal with you

This is my real account very hypocritical coming from the account you used harass me in a thread just to thank this subreddit for the info and for what did convince me to make an account...pointless space

Used to erase world dept of the largest governments, institutes a world wide modern currency that world bank controls via the largest governments.....conspiracy theorist in me I couldn't help it :)

Yes because some lines of software code have never done anything for mankind.....someone doesn't understand modern day technology...it also isn't the same as modern day payment/cash systems
