Do you have a source on that?  I'm not arguing, I'm always down to learn more.

I'd call it amusement more than actually caring : )

Lol what are you, my dad?  Whose to say I haven't already?
You just don't want to admit to the fact that you misspoke when you claimed I took OP's statement at face value...when again, I didn't.
It's okay to admit you're wrong, you know.  It's part of being an adult.
And until you provide evidence to the contrary (for your claims), I will play by the same rules and say what is presented without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.
And if you retort and say "well, same for OP", I would agree in that I never said I believed it, merely found it interesting and would be interested in learning more (at my pace, at my convenience).
To which I would then ask you, *again*, why you are even bothering to still repsond.
I think that saved us some time.

Well hey, those emotions aren't going to get offended on their own!

I'm not accepting them at face value, I merely said I've heard of this theory before and that I find it interesting.  
But here you are both putting words in my mouth and not providing a source for *your* claims...claims that I clearly expressed equal interest in learning more about.

I've heard of this before.  The idea that this is why men simultaneously make up most of the top minds of the world, as well as the worst criminal offenders in the world.  Greater chance of any given man to be notably smater *or* notably dumber than any given woman.  
Interesting stuff.
