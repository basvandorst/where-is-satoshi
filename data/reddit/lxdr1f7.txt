He jumps from people losing confidence in the money and sending up prices to a situation where there is more and more paper money. Because people lose confidence in the currency doesn't mean there somehow is an increase in its supply.

Velocity increases as a result of lower demand for the money?
Its funny because this loss of confidence if only mild ( say 3 % per year) would cause an increase in demand and actually increase gdp.

In this scenario, people are spending already-earned dollars.
But the spending of money is new earnings to the recipients so gdp goes up.

Who says we are gonna change bitcoins for currency. Fuck it a certain proportion of my transaction will just be bitcoin for goods.

Imagine when people find out the constitution is written on piece of paper. They will all panic.

If we ban private money creation we have to ban bitcoin too it seems. Positive money who are behind this are not fans of BTC.

USD's are just as much of a commodity as bitcoin. Just treat them equally.

Money is a resource.

Inflation caused by increases in supply of money (printing) and inflation due to reduction in demand for money (loss of confidence) are different.

Yep its a man made resource. Its value is due to its medium of account, store of value and means of payment.
 Nothing beats electronic money or bitcoin as a means of payment. Gold is inferior in this respect.

"What this means then is that money is nothing but bookkeeping. It is figures. It is a way of measuring what you owe the community and what the community owes you. (...)"
I see money and information as a good. When you purchase something your just exchanging goods. Money derives its value from how efficient it is to exchange, account and store value. No other good can compare in terms of exchange efficiency and thats how money derives its value.
"...that money is a circulation of information and in itself has no value. Gold of course has some value. It has some value for industry and some value for dentistry and some value for jewelry. But as a means of exchanging the goods and services of the world it is as primitive as post horses for carrying the mail. We must recognize then that money is a pure abstraction. (...)"
Isnt that like saying gold in itelf has no value? How you use gold or money is what gives it value.
"But it [money] just isn't real at all because it has the same relationship to real wealth (...) that words have to meaning (...). And as words are not the physical world, money is not wealth. It only is an accounting of available energy - economic energy. (...)"
Wealth can only be physical? Being educated (human capital) for example has no value?

There isn't more paper though. How can people see more paper if there isn't more?

It depends. If people spend on goods and services when they get rid of their money then it is an increase in gdp.
 If people just shift from holding the domestic money to foreign money or other money substitutes like gold then gdp shouldn't increase. Increased demand for gold or other assets might create a wealth effect and increase spending. 
So you need to add up the positives and the negatives to figure out what the effect would be in terms of demand and inflation.

In other words hyperinflation is really good because spending now will cost you much less wealth in the future.

it will be centralised though I think

I think also he is a hard currency person. He thinks only stuff you can physically hold like gold is currency. I don't agree with this but some people could see it this way.
