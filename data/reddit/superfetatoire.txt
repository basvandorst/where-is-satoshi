Except a 51% attack is just not possible anymore at the current hashrate, and even if you managed to pull it off, a 51% attack would not let you steal any bitcoins.

I think it would NOT scale up as transactions get more frequent. What matters in mining is not the single transactions but the blocks being mined, and a block contains all the transactions that were initiated before its discovery. So if you had a trillion transactions, it would still cost the same per block. This also further detracts from the concept of a "per transaction" cost of the blockchain.

Sorry some people are not buying into the utopian rethoric that is being ventilated around and see Bitcoin for what it actually is: a struggling technology that may very well fail to deliver its promise and fulfill its potential.

No, supply acts on the value, but is not the value in itself. Inflation is a factor in determining the liquidity and pricing of a good, but it does not systematically and automatically affect the price.
Regardless, that is only a tangential point. To go back to your main question, it does not cost 525bn to maintain the blockchain also because that is an arbitrary way to account for the generated BTC. If Bitcoin was worth 1$, then does that mean it would cost 1.25mn to pay the miners? If BTC was 1,000,000,000$ would it cost trillions to do the same? Would it really? Would that be an accurate way to account for the invested resources that go into mining?

The thing is that a lot of people believe that if BTC did 10x one year, then it will do it again the next. What they don't realise is that in order for BTC to do 10x again, it would have to do 10x that initial 10x... Of course, after all, why not? However, that is likely to take quite a while. The get rich quick period is over.

I think any effect real circulation has on the price will only be long-term. I don't think the price would suddenly jump because there is no real scarcity, as BTC can be divided indefinitely. On the other hand, there are indeed less units for the same amount of value, so you will need more fiat to buy.

Cute how you "suggest to keep it down". You must feel very authoritative.

The whole point of having a hardware wallet is to have it separate from everything else and being able to store it in, say, a safe or under the mattress. Are you going to buy a smartphone just for that? Or buy cheap, dedicated devices for that instead?
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:56:20
Because simply nobody is taking 525m usd out of their pocket to give the miners. It would be like saying that planet earth pays 130 billion dollars a year to mine 2500 tonnes of gold. It does not make any sense to think of it like that, what matters here is the cost of the mining equipment, infrastructure, etc..., not the perceived value of the mined material.

It's absolutely trivial. All you need to do is program a wallet that sends the legitimate transaction and at the same time spend those same bitcoins to another wallet of your property. All you need to know is here. 
Thinking that people won't or can't double spend for small transactions is just wishful thinking.
Here's a journal article on double spending. You may jump to the conclusion where the researchers note how successful this attack often is, as well as how cheap it is to put in practice. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:09:21
Thanks, that clears things up. Right. So, take the following scenario:
I back up my wallet once.
I spend some of the bit coins in that address, then for some reason lose the new wallet.
I restore my wallet from the earlier backup.
Will I be in control of the change address if I restore my wallet from the earlier backup I had before I spent any of the bitcoins in it? In other words, does my client generate the change address private keys from the original address private key? Or have I lost control of the change address?
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:30:17
Bitcoin micropayments, as in where you pay more in transaction fees than the actual payment you are making?
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:59:50
It's incredibly easy to attempt a doublespend. You just have to program a custom wallet that forks the transaction process and directs the copy to a wallet of your choosing that you possess the private key to, and broadcast both transactions at once. You will succeed every other time on average, perhaps even a bit more if you try broadcasting your custom fork before the expected transaction. Please learn how double spending works before you waltz in all high on your own bullshit stash and start spouting ignorant, inaccurate speculation.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:50:45
Then you go to the police, file a report and have the transactions reversed.

Nothing to fear here, it's only a few neck beards like you that have some sort of persecution fantasy of Bitcoin from the US gov.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:45:43
Yes, it's quite easy, but obviously people still didn't do that. That means Bitcoin is not human-proof. If it's too unintuitive for most people to be able to safely track and store their money, then it's unfit for mass consumption. You can dance around the issue and talk all day about how easy it is to do the right thing and so on, but the hard truth is that people didn't follow these practices. It doesn't matter how supposedly easy it is.
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:15:44

@_date: 2014-02-26 21:37:06
My theory:
A lot of people were actually waiting for the price of BTC to go down before buying some. When MTGOX gave out and the price briefly dropped, a lot of people thought that that was their opportunity to grab cheap BTC and went for it. People are now incited to buy as this they think this is never going to be any cheaper.
 I myself don't expect the price to ever go down any lower than that. There are no foreseeable events that would crash BTC lower than the much-rumoured eventual demise of MTGOX. Now would be the time to buy.
I imagine a lot of people are feeling the same, and this creates high demand, making the price go up.

Unfortunately, transaction fees would make this very expensive. Furthermore, people would be posting based on how much money they would receive.

Still. It's a Bitcoin expo. Bitcoin is a blockchain of data on a digital cloud, not a cigar-smoking revolutionary.

I understand your point but I am having trouble with the entirely speculative nature of your assertion that Bitcoin is inherently less impacted by fraud than traditional fiat.
In the case of, say, dollars. Has there ever been a theft of nearly 7% of the entire money supply in one single event? I have never heard of such a thing happening outside of Bitcoin. I would tend to say that as of now, Bitcoin is inherently more sensitive to fraud due to its irreversibility. If the money's gone, that's game over - forever. A merchant can always dispute a chargeback.

Oh my god, "inflation adjusted" means precisely the opposite of what you are saying. The graph shows productivity vs wages as if inflation did not exist, which means you can look at the data without having to account for inflation as it has been adjusted to hide that parameter.
That's what "adjusted for" means. It's like when you compare two sums of money at different points in time: you adjust one of the sums by the given percentage of inflation that has occurred so you can reflect on their size without having to calculate yourself the actual buying power they represent in relation to each other.
In fact, inflation is not at all relevant in that graph be cause what it aims to show is the divide between wages and productivity, while actually aiming to hide the effects of inflation so the reader can focus on those two parameters.

It seems you are a bit confused. The only thing you can do with bitcoins, short of holding them, is spending them to buy good and services, such as the computers you mention. So, if bitcoin goes down, I can buy less of a computer. If the computer goes down, I can buy more of it. This is why people react differently.
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:44:33
The whole idea of "bitcoin is currently paying 525million to keep the bitcoin network operational" is erroneous. Bitcoin is not a company and it is not paying anybody, it is generating that value to be used on its ledger. Converting those generated bitcoins to dollar to get a value is fallacious, what you have to look at is the cost of hardware, electricity and software development to maintain the mining rigs that run the blockchain.

What if? It's very unlikely that this will ever happen. Of course you can never say never, but I simply do not find that concerning. Another scenario of if a 51% did happen, people would just notice the network is acting weird, and then miners would leave the concerned mining pools until the attacker went under 51% of the hashing power. End of the drama. Another day in the life of Bitcoin.
Mining in itself will never turn unprofitable (unless Bitcoin fails completely, but that's another issue), it's just that there is a hash rate threshold under which you have to stay if you want to pay back your rig and electricity costs. As soon as the hash rate drops, the difficulty lowers as well, which in turn makes miners get back into the game.

That's an assumption, yes, but that does not mean the value of BTC is pressured down 13%. A lot of miners will also buy rigs directly in BTC. The trick is to stop thinking of BTC in terms of a market dollar value.
