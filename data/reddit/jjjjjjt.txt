This is actually fantastic news for LTC, even more so then BTC. Bitcoin MAY get SegWit in December, if 85 (or is it 95?) percent of all hash votes which is nearly impossible. BTC is and will be stuck in the dark ages, enjoy your full blocks and long confirm times. Either it never happens, or you'll have a hard fork to get it.

It's a nonfactor. Segwit will never get activated..it needs 95% of network. The only route is a hard fork..and they will do everything to avoid that. So you get BTC as is, no upgrades. BU looking like a more viable option to save BTC now.

that doesn't mean Segwit should be supported off the bat. Theymos is forcing it down everyone's throat now.

So if Core knew about this 1 year ago, why didn't they do anything until now? Why wait so long?

Many people believe it's in their power to do so, why should they be penalized for exploiting an optimization of the code. It's all fair game.

They forgot the Altcoiner...."did you know it's easy to create your own version of the bitcoin - bitcoin 2.0 [or 3.0] is ever better, smarter and faster!
