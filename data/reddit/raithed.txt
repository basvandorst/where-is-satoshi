You buy BTC from an exchange, Coinbase being one of them, have you read the sidebar?

Hey, thank you so so much. I understand it now, consider this resolved. Appreciate your quick reply.

I will get a wallet myself and keep it secured that way, do you recommend that I keep these other apps that I have bought btc with?

Thanks, I did not know that they charged, I only saw however much left without the fee, but that makes sense.

I bought with Circle before and it didn't ask for a fee.

Is there one wallet better than another? I know I could Google it, etc, but from your personal opinion, which is better?

I bought it at $740... it's $7k now, this was a bit over a year ago, think I'll pull out now? HELL NO!

You transfer to CB, you sell it there, you need to transfer it somewhere later though, bank, etc. The fee is it.

So who's selling?

I use Coinbase, currently holding a bunch in one wallet, is it that bad?
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:40:09
I have a private key.

What are some good exchanges other than Coinbase? Thanks for the info.

Right, I had learned that advice, but if I were to sell it for example then I would have to get it out of my wallet, my question was more so that is Coinbase that bad?
