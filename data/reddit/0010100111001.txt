I am thinking of a way to model moving average difficulty adjustment mathematically and compare against the historical change in difficulty. I believe that you will see a very similar rise in the difficulty in the long term. My question is what do you stand to gain in the long term by changing it to moving average?

The most simple way to explain off blockchain transactions is that a 3rd party keeps a secondary record of the transactions that they conduct. 
Say for example your Mother has 2 bitcoins and she says you and your sibling each have and writes it down on a piece of paper. Later you Father comes in and asks her for some bitcoin so she decides to take .5 from you and .5 from your sister. She updates the piece of paper to reflect the current coin ownership. 
When your father is ready to leave the house and spend his coins, your mother then takes out her phone and send him 1 bitcoin from her wallet. The transaction is then broadcasted on the network. And your mother makes a note on her paper that the 1 bitcoin that was given to your father is now gone from her control. 
This sounds confusing; however, the ultimate result is that 5 transactions took place with your mothers bitcoins and only 1 was broadcasted across the network.
Whether or not off chain transactions solve an existing problem is up for debate. I would submit that there are some use cases that require off chain transactions to meet a tertiary requirement. In my opinion the biggest drawback is that it removes the transaction transparency that the blockchain provides and requires you to trust a 3rd party in a system that is designed to be trustless.

It is more of a question of what are you comfortable with and which do you prefer to work with. Both can be used very securely when done properly.

Here, use offlineaddress.com and read their FAQ about how to be even more secure:
For the lazy:
"If you're looking for the ultimate approach:
1.Download a live disc and compare it's checksum to original source.
2.Boot your machine from a live disc.
3.Load OfflineAddress.com.
4.Disconnect from internet (unplug all network cables, turn off WiFi and Bluetooth, and turn on airplane mode if you have it).
5.Generate addresses and print them out.
6.Restart your machine."
You can take even more precautions if you want to get really serious; however, that depends on how thick the tinfoil is on your hat. Let me know if you need anything else.

This is possible; however, I believe that it is only a viable solution with sufficient transparency. There are right now several companies that keep off blockchain ledgers so that they can move bitcoin throughout their organization without fees.

-You were a little sparse on your exact details so I wrote this assuming you did what I think you did-
Your coins are not in cold storage unless you have generated a private key offline and you keep it offline. The principle behind cold storage is that your private key(what gives you unlimited access to transfer your bitcoins) has never touched the internet(thus why we call it cold.) Every time you scan your private key to spend your coins, you will me making your cold wallet hot.
Here is the disclaimer from blockchain.info's cold storage tutorial
"All Done! Assuming no errors your transaction will be sent instantly. Note: Since the private key has now been scanned by a device connected to the internet many people would no longer consider the address true cold storage anymore. Depending on how concerned you are you might wish to use each key only once and send the rest of the coins to a new address each time."
You do not need to buy a second laptop to put your coins in cold storage. I simply recommend that if you want to regularly access your cold coins, make several paper wallets of smaller denominations and use them as you need them. 
Let me know if you want/need more info. I am glad to help.

Check out Airbitz. They have a good UI and are constantly updating their directory.

You purchase hashing power from cex.io. Once you purchase your desired amount of hashing power, you then mine your desired cryptocurrency with equipment that is stored in a remote datacenter.

No, inflation is caused by an increase in the total quantity of currency in circulation. 
A successful double spend means that one person sends the bitcoins to two people and only one person actually receives the coins. The other person is left empty handed and therefore the total number of bitcoins in circulation stays the same.

Not a problem. I do this all the time in person anyways so I might as well do it on reddit. Thanks for the tips!

Short explanation is that the developers decided that 2016 blocks was the desired sample period to calculate the next rise in difficulty due to hashpower increase and to balance the luck of the miners. 
There has to be a reasonably sized sample period otherwise the difficulty would vary wildly. This is in part due to total hashing power and in part due to luck. If the sample period was small (eg. 15 blocks) and the miners were lucky and found 15 blocks in 45 minutes (not likely but possible) the difficulty would suddenly skyrocket and another block would not be found for an extremely long time. 
Yes blocks could be mined slightly faster if there was a large increase in hash power towards immediately after a new difficulty was calculated. However, that period of faster mining would be short lived since the next  difficulty would be very high to account for that burst of hash power.
