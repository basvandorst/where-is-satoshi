You're a clueless troll. :)
I notice a lot of businesses switching over to the proper Bitcoin but 0 businesses switching over to Bcore.
Makes me wonder if any businesses would support Bcore if Bcore didn't softfork without consensus. I mean who would want to pay $50 dollar fees? I wonder what Bcore would look like if it had to hard fork. Yikes.
 I hope the true Bitcoin hasn't been throttled too badly.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:20:20
Bcore retards don't understand anything past selling their coin to the next retard.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:40:50
Get out of your echo chamber before it's too late
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:25:16
If you tell him to drop Bcore for the superior one, I bet you'll continue to be his favorite son. ��
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:14:03
No, man. I said drop Bcore. Guess you aren't listening.

Wallet's are not nodes. Never have been and never will be. They don't do math. Nodes do the math. Nodes don't own users' Bitcoin. Nodes agree with each other that a users' transaction is valid or not and as a result are granted separate Bitcoin. Your is on the blockchain, your private key is encrypted alongside your Bitcoin transaction.
The system already works. But Blockstream wants a cut so they are going towards lightning. Blockstream says - "Pay us because we've deceived you". Lightning solves nothing. They need a separate chain because that's the only way to steal.
This is not FUD this is science. Educated yourself then take your action.

Blockstream is an American centralized place. GG
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:21:15
You sure about that? I bet in six months wall street will be happy they didn't create the utter failure known as Bcore.

@_date: 2017-12-12 13:41:26
Lmao. Sure pal
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:22:47
He is though haha
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:52:32
Read the white paper. It clearly says a node is a miner.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:29:13
Did you find out that Lightning Network is being renamed to Bank Network? Enjoy the Bcore. Word of advice you should buy some Bitcoin bro.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:34:33
Sure. But what do you say when someone buys more CPU power to mine? One cpu one vote. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:42:11
No, I said to drop Bcore. But you'd like to put words in my mouth wouldn't you. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:08:32
Which segwit? Oh wait, no matter which one you use it isn't wildy adopted. So sad
Funny how your doing exactly what you're complaining about, huh? I wonder how you feel? Probably unaware?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:01:50
Bcore isn't a currency?
Why don't you just buy the real Bitcoin and wait as it gets adopted in businesses everywhere. Then you won't have to convert to fiat and just enjoy purchasing with the true Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:24:24
Sick burn am I right?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:46:02
You sound angry. Why don't you calm down and enjoy your high fees and slow transaction times? LOL
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:06:43
What happens when you do?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:13:27
Why doesn't Bcore go off and try to do a fork with $50 fees. I'm sure they will get 1/5 of the community.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:16:47
So if you want to follow consensus why support Bcore? They obviously had 0 consensus when they soft forked.
Why not go for the coin that now has 1/5 of the Bitcoin market after hard forking? Soon it will likely be more.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:32:04
Thanks for confirming that you likely possess zero knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:45:59
Happy welfare folks
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:23:52
Agreed. Why would anyone want to give their value over to some people who control your police officers and want to place you in jail if you disobey giving them some of your value. Then they go off to use that value they stole from you to go kill some "terrorists" in the middle east as well as many other sinful activities.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:10:47
With all due respect, who cares if your computer cant do that? Don't argue that the entire network should have to deal with high fees just because your computer can't handle currently handle downloading larger block chain. Also, who is to say your future computer won't be able to do that? If we wait some time I bet everyone's computer CAN download 1gb every 10 minutes once Morse's law gets into effect for some period of time. Especially since it will take quite some time for Bitcoin to go mainstream anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:17:55
Cool so why can't I hold some other coin that can get me rich as well as buy me my coffee? Why chose something that can only do X when I have something that can do X and Y? If Bitcoin's only value is that I can sell it to someone in the future what happens if no one wants to buy it? At least if there is some alternative where the market has set a price for something I know I can use that alternative to purchase that something because the market has determined that value for that alternative.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:15:15
What do you mean by organic usage? Does opening up a coffee shop and accepting Bitcoin with less than .2% fees fit into your use of the term organic usage?
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:44:38
You know this makes me wonder. If people believe these pump and dumps are happening why not take matters in your own hands? Take these pumpers money. Buy low, wait for them to pump, then sell. If more people had this mindset these pumpers would be too scared to ever do it again.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:50:25
Yeah, thanks Satoshi!
Now let's all just totally ignore your white paper because clearly blockstream is more talented than you. :o)
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:43:44
What makes you say that Gavin is worse than blockstream? He worked closely with Satoshi himself so I would argue he understands Bitcoin better than blockstream since he worked with it from the ground up. Also, why would people working on Bitcoin be of any benefit. Perhaps there are a lot of people that don't know what they're doing that are working in blockstream and they have way too many cooks in the kitchen? They have already proven failure with Seg2x so isn't it likely more failure will continue?
Since when has the network not been in the hands of the miners? There were only major Bitcoin miners back in the early days and now there are many more. If certain miners end up making up most of the network so what? That's just how capitalism works. I'm sorry but I'd rather have comfort in knowing that some well verse miner can take care of Bitcoin mining for me because I sure as hell don't want to run Bitcoin mining on my macbook pro especially when it's much more vastly inefficient compared to what they have. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:55:55
Why would you think that? The math says it would roughly take the blocksize to be only 1gb for Bitcoin to become mainstream adopted. That should be easily do-able with Morse's law.
How will Segwit ever go mainstream? At some point, won't it simply run out of space to be able to go mainstream? Isn't increasing the blocksize a prerequisite to going mainstream?
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:23:20
Isn't hijacking the Bitcoin code and deleting it's original developer (the one who gave Blockstream the code in the first place) a centralizing move?
Technically, anyone can go out and compete with one another to create the best mining. That's called capitalism not centralization. What exactly can miners do that is so awful that we need to halt the blocksize and create massive fees?

Transfer btc to monero. Create a new btc wallet not tied to any exchange. Transfer monero back to btc. What taxes?
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:38:49
Perhaps you're correct. This would call for a P2P exchange which isn't currently all that popular with cryptocurrency users.
This would only matter if goverment seriously starts looking into btc which I doubt they would even be able to do based on their track record.
