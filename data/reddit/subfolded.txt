I certainly think we can do far better than 1MB and still be fine so I'm in agreement with what you're saying except one point that I heard on here a while ago, when Veriblock jacked up the mempool with their mainnet launch:
No matter what size we make the blocks, "things" like Veriblock will pop up. They are a completely viable business model when fees are cheap, and break down when fees are expensive. So no matter what size you make the blocks, you're moving the goalpost but Veriblock and the like will just fill it right up to the same relative level (the level at which the tx fees make their business model barely sustainable) with similar end-result fees for a reasonable-priority tx for the rest of us.  It has to be true - I read it on the internet.

I know it's not ready for prime time yet, but if Lightning Network gets traction I have serious concerns for the use case of LTC. I have some, and am debating swapping for BTC. ETH seems different enough to warrant hanging onto a lotto ticket, but LTC... not really seeing it anymore.

Good thinking. What are you going to do when you get your 3 new trucks? :-)
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:59:19
Agreed. The fact that (in US, anyway) you "have to" handle capital gains taxes if you try and actually buy a real item with BTC is already a huge issue for adoption, even if you or I think it's silly. I was hoping Libre would jump start some clarity on regulation, but it appears they're just squashing it outright.

Thanks! I did increase dbcache, but didn't know until today that you could move chainstate to a different drive than the 250GB blockchain. Will do that next; I do have a spare SSD that couldn't hold the blockchain but would work for what you're proposing!

Well, I don't mind it in that respect b/c the math works out the same in terms of "minutes to wait for confidence." i.e. these 1 minute blocktime sh\*tcoins tend to use 60 confirmations as a rule of thumb.
My issue with faster blocks (even 1MB ones) is the same issues we all have with "the Cash fork" i.e. propagation lagging mining (more orphan blocks) and a blockchain that grows too fast and outpaces hobby level hardware, threatening centralization.

I was unaware of this sleep feature, but that's all very interesting and you are likely spot on in your assessment then, however in the edge case of 1sat/byte, I don't see the harm in simply dumping it all at once. Also, mostly echoing your last point, if these gradual releases of transactions are hitting mempool before any of the previous ones clear out, there is no real benefit over a full dump as far as I can tell. I'd agree that time is money and it would be very unreasonable to babysit the process when you could set a sleep delay and walk away.
Thanks for the education! Is there any resource explaining the sleep() function? I'm finding it difficult to find with a search engine because the "sleep" term is obviously throwing all kinds of false positives. Is it a command line instruction in BTC Core?

Yes, I agree. I got a bit harsh with this 1sat "bot" just because of things like Veriblock running as unoptimized as it is. You could spam 1 sat tx all day long until the mempool is 1GB and it wouldn't noticably affect anyone.

BUT THEY PROMISED!!!   /s
I'll admit in 2017 I used LTC extensively to actually move any money around even if all I wanted was to trade it to/from BTC. I'll also project with nearly 100% certainty that there will be another bull run like 2017, and no BTC scaling solution will be built up enough to actually prevent the same mempool backlog, but that's just my opinion.
I guess my biggest gripe about using LTC to solve any congestion problems is that, technically, faster block times are pretty much the same solution as larger blocks. And I'm sure nobody on this subreddit wants to admit they're solving a problem with that solution........ It does make a perfect and convenient stop-gap, though.

That's my reason for the reluctance to spend the cash to upgrade. Syncing is painful but this is only the 2nd time since 2017 (the first being the initial DL back then) and so I'll just sit and wait I suppose. I hope the drive isn't dying...
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:30:49
Technically the Bitcoin protocol incentivize miners to save all these 1 sat/byte tx for last (all tx size being equal, which isn't necessarily true) but that's ok. If all tx's except these get confirmed than 2sat/byte should clear next block, which is still dirt cheap. I actually commend this "spammer, not spammer" on sticking with 1sat/byte, but it still drives me nuts to see the mempool fill up with unoptimized nonsense. I'm also cranky and hungry, my original post may have mostly been due to that...

That's what I did - I bumped it up from default (450MB I think?) to something like 3GB on the cache size and another 1GB on the max mempool size (I heard that if the mempool doesn't fill up this parameter, the leftover is applied to the cache and so with current mempool I effectively am running at 5GB cache now.)
That's what started this mess, haha. After changing the config file I wanted to see if it actually improved syncing and so I deleted the most recent .dat file for the blocks, thinking it would just erase the last few hours of activity. I was very wrong...
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:30:24

On one hand yes; I pay my cap gains, write off my mining rig, etc. In 2017 I treated BTC like a stock and the taxes made sense, but I sold it all off and started over by mining (income) and don't plan on selling, only "using", and so now the taxes dont seem like a good fit the intended purpose. Low volatility would make the different tax treatment (currency) an easier pill for IRS to swallow, but how could you define something so relative as volatility...
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:18:55

@_date: 2019-07-31 01:16:33
But if you earn USD and buy with USD, you're not playing any market, and only subject to income tax and sales tax.
If you earn BTC and spend BTC, it's treated as if you sold for USD and bought in USD, which isn't the same and you're subject to capital gains that are calculated from a very difficult to derermine cost basis.
I agree the capital gains rule is going to be a nonstarter for use as a real currency and it needs to be corrected.

While I admit I don't try that hard to hide my tracks (I"m not doing anything illegal) as far as I know the exchanges that you would need in order to convert said altcoins into BTC all require KYC/AML at least in the US and most developed countries. ESPECIALLY if you try to ultimately get back into fiat, but even if you stay in BTC it's not super-easy but I'm sure it can be done if you're more resourceful than I. Perhaps decentralized exchanges, if you can find one that is TRULY decentralized and can't be pressured by regulators. Back in 2018 you had places like ShapeShift allowing you to swap altcoins for BTC anonymously, but they fell to regulation in the end, as they all do as they get popular.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:11:24

While this is fun to watch, I have to point out that given the insane volatility of BTC, if all we're doing is waiting for these numbers to show up within the indicated month of course it's going to happen. I bet on Oct 2019 we'll see $16,000.... and $25,000.... and $10,000.... $18,000......

I'll add to that - we underestimate just how fast the same satoshis can be routed back and forth endlessly on the same set of channels if needed. I have a guy who asked me via reddit if he could test out some script he made and he routes the same 300 sats back and forth at incredible speeds. I can always tell when he's messed around with his script because I check on my node and it's routed hundreds of transactions of all the same 300 sats. I charge him nearly nothing, but imagine scripts like this becoming commonplace (say as part of an auto-rebalancing or something) for peers that you're charging more reasonable fees.

Well, with Lightning Network in it's current state of development, when someone creates a new payment channel all of the money is on their side. So initially, that channel is capable of sending money FROM that node, but not TO that node. Rebalancing is the act of shuffling money around on the network so that you get money on both sides so that a single channel is capable of passing funds in both directions.
"Auto-rebalancing" may not even be a real thing yet, but I'm sure lots of people are working on it because it would be very desirable in the eyes of many node operators.

Funny you say that - I sorta did, but by accident. I first heard about BTC in mid-2017, and bought BTC LTC and ETH. Sold every last coin by the end of 2017 for no reason other than that as a stock daytrader I made a habit of going into each new year 100% in cash for ease of recordkeeping for taxes. That wasn't even a logical move in stocks, but it saved my ass in crytpo! I completely missed the bubble-burst. I then built a Titan V mining rig with some of the capital gains and since Feb 2018 I've been mining my BTC back (nothing else - maximalist now).

UPDATE: The drive is shot. Attempted full clone to new drive with ACRONIS to no avail. Although pegged at 100% usage at all times, I managed to physically copy/paste "C:\\Users\\\[user\]\\.eclair\\" folder contents to a USB drive prior to swapping out the bad HDD.
BTC Core node happened to be installed on a separate drive but with the introduction of a replacement main HDD with a new installation of Windows, the blockchain needed to be reindexed. After installing a new copy of Eclair to the replacement drive, it produced the error message that it could not connect to BTC node (which is expected, since the fresh install did not have the proper config file yet.)
At this point I restored the old files from USB stick and reran Eclair. All 7 payment channels, after being wide open for theft since Aug 30th (8 days ago), are completely intact. Most of the 7 nodes were well-connected and so likely just didn't notice a channel being offline for over a week, but nevertheless I thank everyone for being honest.
While we now know that having a backup of “C:\\Users\\\[user\]\\.eclair\\" is sufficient to at least get your node/URI back in the event of a drive failure,  keep in mind that even if you are ready to go with a drive swap the BTC Core node is going to be confused (even if on another drive) and you will be susceptible to theft until it is fully synced to the blockchain. (My initial sync took less than 2 days when I originally had to DL the blockchain, I have no idea why it took a week to resynchronize headers using same hardware in both cases.)

Thanks - good read. I'll admit I still am not sure of the answer, but then again this isn't entry-level stuff. It appears that if the nodes I connect to and fund do not fund in return, my payment channel will gradually shift the balance from me to them until it's all over there, unless at some intermediate point they have a reason to route money back through me to someone else. Obviously it can't work any other way or else money would be unfairly changing hands I suppose.

Well, here's my thing about places like that - there are several places that allow you to swap your crypto for gift cards in a roundabout way of buying "anything" with crypto, but in my opinion they don't do anything for adoption. Someone who starts a company exchanging crypto for gift cards is clearly already deep into the crypto space and doesn't need any more convincing. And all those places that accept the gift cards (AMZN etc) are not exposed to the crypto at all, and for them it's business as usual.
One thing I did do to make a difference with adoption, however, is link my Lightning Network node to [THESE GUYS]( who run a cafe that accepts Bitcoin payments via Lightning Network!

I started running a full BTC node and now a Lightning Network node. Mostly just to help learn more about my investment, and also it feels good to help it grow. In a way, helping the network grow should help increase price (no guarantee of of course). The added bonus is that the more you learn about BTC and the more actively involved you feel, the less you worry about the price because you feel confident that it'll be "just fine" sooner or later.

True, but I'm not necessarily sure why you would need it. Until channel factories are finalized onboarding will still be a bottleneck, but once you're in, the lightning Network payment can just fly non-stop all day long. I run a lightning node myself, and one of my payment channels processed over 2,000 transactions from the same couple thousand satoshi's flying back and forth.

The endgame is that all of this Lightning Network crap will be completely invisible to end user. It's all back end stuff and the common example is how we now send email with literally no knowledge of what actually happens to make that work.

I use this guy's node as a snapshot of the mempool 
and the conversion from 50 blocks to 8 hours was just using an average of 10 min per block although of course they can vary significantly. My BTC node config is: txconfirmtarget=50

@_date: 2018-09-28 15:50:18
Not sure who's right, but [Coindance]( is saying 51% of nodes are safe (counting older versions that do not have the exploit).
My node is currently connected to 6x 16.3, 3x 16.2, 2x 16.0. and 3x 15.1 and so my random sample of 14 shows 43% are safe from the exploit. I am really surprised it's taking so long for people to bother.
To instill a sense of urgency I invite anyone to check out [PGN on CoinMarketcap]( \- they are a fork who did not upgrade the vulnerability in time and a whoooole lotta coins dumped on them out of thin air.

I have a friend who has Acronis disk imaging software and he claims he's used that to duplicate an image onto a smaller drive (for example when upgrading from HDD to SSD) on various computers, and so I may try that next. It is not intended to work with damaged drives, however, and so results may vary.
@_date: 2018-09-27 00:15:19
Well technically I shouldn't have alluded that I pay a specific sat/byte; in the configuration file of the Bitcoin core wallet I have it set for a blockchain inclusion target of 50 blocks which equates to roughly 8 hours. My typical fee for a transaction tends to be on the order of .03 to .12 USD, but as far as actual inclusion time goes I've been lucky for over a month now, typically getting in within an hour just on a couple of lucky blocks that were solved in rapid succession clearing the mempool. It looks like this specific time it took almost exactly 8 hours so I shouldn't complain, since that's exactly what I asked for...
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:24:09

Yes I set txconfirmtarget=50 but I did not specify an exact fee otherwise. Usually it's been working fine but today I got caught in a solid 7 or 8 hours where the mempool did not fully clear so I had to wait, but it's confirmed now.

Has this improved for you? I am seeing the exact same situation play out for me as well. I have funded 7 nodes, some larger than others and with varying fees (one as low as 1 satoshi) and still no fish are biting. I did have 2 others connect with me for a day or so and so I know I'm configured properly. I'm debating closing the 7 channels and going with 2 larger channels in order to keep funding larger.
@_date: 2018-09-27 23:30:39

Thanks for the education! Does this mean that the only thing my (listening) node does beyond the non-listening nodes are things like allowing mobile or lightweight clients to connect to me for verification, and onboarding newbies with old blockchain data for initial synch?

Wow - I mean that makes total sense logically, but I had no idea it happened so fast. I mean, it's not like someone's sitting there scooping up Tx in the mempool and packing them up in nice little boxes. I would think that calculating the optimum collection of mempool Tx to maximize fees collected would be near-instantaneous for a computer.
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:49:30
Yeah I saw that once I paid attention to the usernames, ha. I'm actually waiting for my funds to clear b/c I had to close an inactive node before creating a new one. I'm cheap and have my Tx fees set to practically nothing since the mempool has been clearing at least once a day during this bear market. Yes, I see the irony in messing with LN while getting along just fine with near-zero fees on-chain but we all know this 1sat/byte era will vaporize as soon as BTC gets another bump.
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:42:54
Your linked tutorial is command line Linux stuff that's over my head, but it seems to be the way the majority of users are doing it. I am running Win10 so if for whatever reason you wanted to go that route instead I'm happy to help step you through what I did (Bitcoin Core node and Éclair Lightning Node).
One thing I'd say right away (I assume it applies to Linux as well as Windows) is that as the first frikkin step of Lightning setup, you have to mess with the configuration file of Bitcoin Core. As soon as you do that, Bitcoin Core informs you that it has to reindex the whole damn blockchain. So unless you want to wait a long time twice in a row, I’d mess with the bitcoin config file before it spends too much time downloading the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-09-28 17:10:47
Ah, thanks. Perhaps a stupid question, but do the non-listening nodes "matter" in the sense that they can't broadcast info out to others anyway? If they are running the node only for themselves and validating for themselves, are they putting themselves at risk but not others?
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:06:15
I came all the way back to amuse you with my dumbass story: I accidentally scheduled the Eclair installation exe instead of the actual program. I log in and thought it was asking for an install b/c the previous version had been somehow butchered. I realized what had happened before doing anything drastic and so no big deal but I'm feeling pretty stupid. ;-)
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:07:32
I'm stuck in a holding pattern for days until my BTC Core node fixes the entire 9 year old blockchain (migrated to a new drive, remember...) and quickly getting discouraged about this whole thing. Whenever the blockchain is synced, I would like to attempt to fire up Eclair again and see if I can get reconnected to my channels. (I have salvaged the entire eclair folder from AppData including the config file if that helps.) According to the above linked similar situation, is it a different situation if I were to fire up eclair again but NOT try and close my open channels? Would that give my instance of eclair a chance to catch up to the current state before trying to close out channels and get the hacker penalty?
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:41:25
I'm HOLDing - I got super lucky and cashed out 100% of my cryptos at the end of 2017. For 2018 I took some of the proceeds and built a mining rig so I'm now accumulating from a cost basis of zero (save electricity) so it's far less stressful to ignore the news and the charts.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:08:39
That's not a solution. Right now we earn dollars, pay taxes on them, and then piss it away on junk with no regard to taxes at point of sale (aside fomr sales tax in US). Having to know or care about your capital gains at the point you part with your crypto for a coffee is like saying you bought coffee with AAPL stock because you sold the AAPL stock for USD, and then gave Starbucks USD. Nobody would call that "paying for coffee with AAPL stock" because that's not a practical solution, even if software would exist that does it for you.

The platters spin so I doubt it's a bearing; the thing just spazzes out when plugged in at 100% usage all the time.

It's pretty clear that going THAT far into BTC maximalism is borderline reckless at this early stage. And even aside from that, for as confident as you clearly are why wouldn't you instead rather buy $20 more BTC directly every month?
@_date: 2018-08-21 18:26:35
I'm gonna be totally honest with you from the perspective of "the everyday peeps": I downloaded the BTC Core wallet weeks ago and synched 250GB of block-stuffz. Then I tried to set up a Lightning node. Then I did whatever config changes you had to do to enable incoming traffic or whatevers. Then it said to resynch the blockchain. Wait... wut? Okay so DL 250GB more blockstuffz. Then have to configure router to allow port 8-sumthin-sumthin. I can't do it at the time (or don't think it's a good idea for security purposes) because I'm remoting into said PC. Decide to finish sometime when I'm home and can personally get at the hardware. Never happened.
Unsolicited advice from a non-developer: If just ten of the uber-devs who got off setting up and running a LN node would instead focus on making a user-friendly completely point-and-click GUI based (absolutely NO Linux/command line crap) Lightning and full BTC node "installer" we'd be in a much better place right now.
Funny thing is, after all that I haven't watched the vid you linked yet. Hopefully it's become just that simple as more people do it, but I will indeed at least watch it when I get out of work. I literally am sitting on a fully synched full BTC qt wallet with no funds in it and no idea what to do with it because I'm "the dumber real people".
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:47:58
I traded stocks for nearly a decade before finding crypto last year. Holy hell I'm never going back.
Edit: I traded but fully cashed out at end of 2017, and then built a mining rig with some of the proceeds for 2018, and so I'm also (effectively) dollar cost averaging BTC by way of the electricity cost.
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:00:08

@_date: 2018-08-20 02:36:13
Just my opinion, but here goes. The BTC diff retarget method of simply counting out 2016 blocks is a terrible way to do it, and there probably was no reason aside from simplicity. We forget that when the BTC network was in its infancy there were no such thing as altcoins. Miners had nowhere to flock from or disappear to like nowadays. That's why all these carbon-copy altcoins that don't bother putting any thought behind their forks get slammed by diff target issues as profit switching pools just slam them when diff goes lower, and every miner abandons them for other coins as soon as difficulty readjust upward, thereby making the problem worse.
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:34:11
I came all the way back to reddits-ville to upvote and tell you that I just watched that linked vid and it was very good and easy enough to follow, so thx.
That said, I likely still won't be able to run a LN node however unless I can figure out the static IP aspect. (I'm not asking for you to spoon feed me that, I'm just pointing out that even this vid can't teach a complete n00b.) I've heard from a friend that my ISP won't even let me have a static IP, although I was under the impression this happens at the hardware level with my wifi router and has nothing to do with the ISP. I assume this is all addressed by that simpleportforwarding software you briefly mentioned, but that's the part that I'm stuck on.
Also, he mentions that he spent $13 but I'm not sure if that's recurring (like a VPS) or a one-time payment. Die-hard enthusiasts may pay $13 to support BTC LN (and I would), but only a handful would ever dream of paying any amount of a recurring bill and I'm sure as hell not paying for a VPS. I'm sure 99% of this comment is making computer-savvy redditors cringe all along the way, but I'm putting it all out there to show everyone just how dead-simple this will ultimately have to be, and you can be assured that the "true" layperson is going to be leagues behind even my understanding on this.

I admit the only DEX I've used so far is CryptoBridge so they may not all be like this, but here goes. Its ridiculously terrible with connections and latency and weak volume, and all 3 of those reasons are due to the same problem: DEXs are popping up everywhere, they are a dime a dozen, and so people who could actually host these things and trade on them are spread too thin. There's no fix because stopping random DEXs from copying each other and spawning endless new ones would be against free and open market.

@_date: 2018-08-22 13:39:12
I'm familiar with pruning - if it was originally synced that way it was unintentional as I have a dedicated drive for the BTC node. If you don't make the port forwarding video no worries - it's probably already out there but I haven't researched it yet. It is technically part of the LN node setup though, and so skipping this step makes a LN setup deceptively simple for newbies. As far as spending a lot of time making a video for free, if you're paying $13 to run this thing for absolutely nothing in return (handful of satoshi in collected fees?) then you're already being philanthropic and willing to support the BTC cause. ;-)

Okay if you have a link to a WCN donation you are either running it or an uber-fan, so I'll admit I was overly harsh there.
JW Weatherman is a joke and the Fenton Interview alone is all you need to see there. He also has way too high an opinion of himself - I'm an idiot, don't pretend to be an intellectual, and keep it humble and fun as everyone should.  Although I think BTC maximalists like Adam Meister swing a little too firmly to that side of the argument, I actually keep listening to him occasionally to keep me in check when I start chasing garbage coins.
I wouldn't call this a suggestion because I think I'm in that minority here, but I don't live and breathe podcasts and a flood of episodes daily just reduces the quality of content and nobody could keep up with it anyway. I would rather see a single "quality" episode every handful of days but feel free to ignore that b/c I dont feel that most people agree with me there.

The fact that you think WCN is nothing but a bunch of idiots makes me think you and I have exactly the same taste because I agree wholeheartedly haha. Thank you for the list I will check out yours as well I personally have settled on the Bad Crypto Podcast and Crypto 101. The Bad Crypto Podcast is much more like a professional radio show and The Two Hosts didn't know much about crypto the beginning of 2017 when they started it so you can actually follow along and learn with them they're pretty knowledgeable now. I normally don't like podcasts that just have an interview every single episode because I my opinion that's lazy you're not actually providing any of your own content with each episode you were just letting somebody else talk these guys do have some interviews but they also add a lot of their own (good) content. They also know how to make it entertaining much more so than any other amateur podcaster I've seen out there.  as far as crypto 101 I really like the host he is a great guy my only complaint there is again he has a lot more interviews, but does add his our personal touches.

So the "technical" taxable event is the fact that your BTC is worth mroe and you have capital gains, but nevertheless, you're stuck with that calculation while just trying to get a damn coffee. That's like selling some AAPL stock at a profit for USD, paying taxe son that gain, then buying coffee with that USD. Nobody would consider that "paying for coffee with AAPL stock" if that makes any sense.
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:35:32
Don't mean to run to you for tech support, but I think the issue is that my BTC Core wallet is encrypted, which you did mention in the video, however since your example core wallet wasn't a real funded one you may have not done it this way in your "real" wallet. When trying to open/fund channels error says "Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first. (code: -13)  It makes sense that encrypting the wallet would prevent eclair from moving money in and out I suppose...     I did confirm using openportchecktool that port 9735 is open.

As I read through all of these posts (my apologies I was not here in 2009) I'm realizing 2 things:
Firstly, Having to deal with capital gains because you bought a coffee is not going to work, whether somene makes a slick program to do it for you or not, that's not a solution when it falls on your lap come tax time.
Secondly, if they even consider "letting purchases slide"then an obvious tax loophole for capital gains would be to HODL and buy physical things to take profits tax free. Since that's certianly not going to fly, the whole thing is F'd, and there is no solution, which is why everyone is saying this has been going on since 2009. Sorry for opening a can of cryptoworms.

I've been "exploiting" this to fund my lightning channels since fall 2018. Definitely a longstanding usage pattern. What I don't fully understand is, based on this explorer from ACINQ, [ it appears (at an eyeball estimation) that Europe has as many LN nodes as USA. While I get that LN node concentration does not necessarily correspond to BTC adoption and usage, I'm sure it's a very good correlation. So why doesn't the spike continue beyond USA's business hours? Europeans better integrated into Segwit?

Is it eclair mobile or the eclair implementation for PC?
I'm fairly certain that services like Lightning Conductor and others allow you to exchange on-chain BTC for lightning BTC (for a small fee I'm sure).
 Eclair mobile can't accept payments yet so it wouldn't work for that, but I think they are very close to implementing it (it's already available on testnet anyway).

FWIW back before crypto it was already shown that going simultaneously long and short on the same stock would long-term be net negative, not neutral. I analyzed it once because there are many funds that have fees associated with them that act as "gravity" that the price has to fight against. I thought by shorting and longing in a neutral way I could just collect that fee, but due to your positions getting out of balance in terms of fiat as the price moves, the assumptions break down.

Now THAT would excite me - if merchants would pass on some savings for using BTC. Generally speaking customers in first-world countries have no incentive to try out BTC if CC works just fine.

Depends on how rediculously optimistic you want to place the "mass adoption" marker on the field.

The BTC protocol doesn't give a crap what a fork does, and so although their complacency would cause them to possibly miss out on free money it's not like they'd lose their Bitcoin. (Unless the fork becomes Bitcoin... oh dear.)

50% adoption is an embarrassment. I was wondering how it is still so low until I read the comments below regarding 2 bad actors. I've never used either service, but if they are not supporting SegWit doesn't that meant that they have higher operational costs (due to tx size and therefore mining fees being larger)? If they have inherently higher operating costs how have they not simply been squeezed out by competition?

" To start, I would have to open the payment channel with the coffee shop,  "
This part is the most common misunderstanding with Lightning Network. You do have to create a channel to get "on board" the Lightning Network, but once you do you're free to do business with ANYONE on the Lightning Network, provided the original node you made a channel with can route your payment to your final destination.
For example I have 50 connections, and so if you made a single channel with me I can route to pretty much any other node within 2 hops unless they're woefully under-connected themselves (which a merchant wouldn't be). If you don't mind big companies, ACINQ are a good company and have a huge node with roughly one thousand channels.
If you DO mind big channels and prefer a random schmuck, connect with me because ACINQ is one of my 50 connections, so you still get the connectivity anyway.   ;-)

One case where it may be worth worrying about would be some kind of non-contentious fork where it's not readily apparent which way is the best solution. You may wish to just hold tight and not move either set of coins until one is clearly favored. Not something like the blocksize where technical arguments can be demonstrated to be true or nonsense, but maybe something like base-layer privacy where it's more subjective and less technical in terms of which one is "better".

Yeah I tried it with all those VIX derivatives, with contango over 3% monthly. If you are 50% long and 50% short, you by definition have equal numbers of dollars on both sides. Now VXX or whatever goes down, and suddenly you are far more exposed short than long, and no longer neutral. At that point, whether you try to rebalance or not the fact remains that you aren't sitting neutral at all times like you'd intuitively think you would be.
Eventually I got into options, where you truly can create passive income from being neutral, long, or short. You can lose your shirt with options almost as fast as crypto! Almost.

I'll definitely give it a read. My node is set to retain something ridiculous like 3 GB worth of data in the mempool, so hopefully I did my part.
If I was the only person on the planet to allocate more than 100MB to the mempool (I'm certainly not, but let's say...) and someone creates so much data and with so low a fee that it's unconfirmed for longer than anyone else can hold it, and my single node is the only one hanging onto this data, would it still eventually go through? I would think it only takes a single node to be able to rebroadcast it when needed.
If this entire thought experiment is answered by Andreas in the aforementioned link, my apologies and I'll find out soon enough!
EDIT: Good read - thanks. As I think about it, the UTXO set isn't necessarily related to mempool size, is it? I think I have a misunderstanding here, and am wondering if there's something else I could change in my configuration in regard to UTXO set in addition to the mempool allocation? I essentially have a dedicated Win10 PC that does nothing else besides BTC Core and a Lightning node, and so all hardware resources are at its disposal.

The thing that's a little bit hard to visualize until you get the hang of it is that although there is a 21 million cap on "whole bitcoins" that will be issued, bitcoins are divisible down to eight decimal places, and the concept of a whole Bitcoin is rather arbitrary in the first place.
If every single Bitcoin on Earth was unrecoverably lost except for a single Bitcoin, you'd still have 100,000,000 satoshis to build an economy with. A Satoshi would just be worth a lot in that case, and I'd be filthy rich ��

They only appear correlated because interest in BTC is rising (hashpower and price are both going up continually, at least in a large enough timeframe). Number of BTC tweets and Google searches probably also correlate to energy usage but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to always be related.
This can't continue forever - at some point adoption had to plateau (hopefully when EVERYONE is using it!) and at that  point both price and energy usage are free to find their equilibrium.

\&gt; move to an energy-efficient proof of whatever 
Not that simple. Devs aren't burning energy for fun; nobody's discovered a better way to secure the network. (Just because proof-of-stake is a term doesn't mean that it works.)
\&gt; if it's not in the miners' interest 
It's not just the miners - proof of work is the best security we have (at least right now) and so nobody would be interested in changing to a less secure model.
\&gt; putting the other half in energy-efficient alts that may or may not have a future... 
Do what you want, but just because you are environmentally conscious doesn't mean energy-efficient alts have a working security model. Taking a step back; if securing the network didn't consume many resources, then generally speaking a wealthy person would have an easier time attacking the network because you're not consuming said attacker's resources.  If I were you and you feel conflicted about the energy consumption, instead of dumping the money in an altcoin that claims to be eco-friendy I'd cash out and put some of the capital gains toward something like solar power for your home, etc. You don't have to keep your money in crypto.

I suppose you could "maybe" get people on board with that since you're still asymptotically never actually touching/surpassing 21M, but at that point you're so far divisible I can't imagine there'd be any monetary value to the unit.

I hate to stare into the face of actual data and say (Trump voice) "WRONG!" but does anyone actually remember Dec 2017?  Literally everyone was piling into exchanges while mainstream media pumped the hell out crypto by continually obsessing about today's prices. Exchange servers were having full-on meltdowns all day long, and Coinbase was adding over 100k new account daily or something like that.
I remember watching BTC hit the ATH in realtime and I remember GDAX servers being bogged down such that I couldn't place a sell order even if I wanted to - the platform was down constantly.

2 things:
The default is often 1sat, but we're nearly all running 1 millisat for no good reason, so you're effectively being undercut by three orders of magnitude in fees.
Looking on any LN visualizer/explorer, all the big guys are already well funded with channels directly to each other. ACINQ, rompert, LNbig(s), y'alls, you name it. If you connect with all of them you wind up completely redundant, but with less capacity than them. I found much better luck connecting "smaller, but key" nodes to each other on my own using a bit of strategy after studying the explorers. One small example was connections to PenguinShooter when his lightning game was about to come out, because obviously his game was going to route through his node.
Just connect to me, because my little node is awesome ;-) I'll match with a return channel.

.001 BTC (millibit) seems to have been used for a while with "normal everyday" purchases since it's on the order of magnitude as a dollar.
It never caught on for me, but if I had to pick a system I'd go with Bitcoin/millibit/satoshi as the 3 main units.

In 2017 lots of students who were in charge of computer labs set up secret mining among all the lab's computers.

I happened to be on GDAX watching live when BTC ran to 20k - was a crazy thing. I wanted to sell but was afraid to b/c all exchanges were having server issues, which was partially adding to the panic and hysteria that led to 20k in the first place.

Poor choice of wording I suppose. I meant can we stop generating/supporting old style addresses, but as I type this I realize you can generate addresses practically by hand if your "hardcore crypto" enough, and so yes I suppose this is impossible to prevent.
Normally I would say that "at least they are paying more in fees as a punishment" but in reality it's their customers who are financing that burden, and most are probably uninformed and don't even realize they are wasting money.

@_date: 2019-03-30 14:01:48
Unfortunately it appears we didn't have a channel and so hopefully everyone else notices and closes them without cheating. Even if they DID cheat, the only way to cheat is to get away with posting an out of date channel state. Chances are good that at no point were channels that you funded completely empty on your side, and in those cases they can't even take "all" of the money. For channels that saw little or no activity, they couldn't take more than a few satoshis! (I suppose if they intentionally kept the channel open indefinitely then NOBODY would get the money, but that's being malicious just for the sake of being an ass...)
There is another subreddit called r/lightningnetwork where you may get more exposure to the community of node operators if you still want to broadcast what happened and hope for the best. This stuff is so new that as far as I've seen the vast majority of node operators are enthusiasts that likely wouldn't be bad actors but maybe I give people too much credit.

Human psychology works they other way too, though. How many people dump more and more money into Bitcoin until they finally post all over Reddit that they've made it into the "21 million club". I'd be curious if their aggressiveness in accumulating more shows down significantly once they got that nice round 1BTC. If so, the high price actually encourages more buy-in. It's the exact same principle as how masternode coins pray on psychological finances with an arbitrarily large collateral amount, except without the dev exit scam. (Well...

FWIW one of the biggest nodes earns about $5 monthly, and everyone else would be lucky to earn $1 monthly. The current BTC mempool is mostly empty since the bubble pop and so there's no incentive for Lightning to be charging fees - we're all running at practically zero fees and undercutting each other.
On the flipside, there's no overhead to run the node, so it's not like we're losing money - it's just fun experimentation at the moment.
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:55:04
It'll take a while for the infrastructure, but once exchanges and most importantly mobile wallets work with LN it shouldn't be an issue, however I think that's a long way away. If you needed that right now, honestly I'd go altcoin but then you risk it's actual value tanking on you.

Ah, so what you're saying is instead of batching your buy-in direct to a Ledger Nano or what have you, buy-in on Lightning (in the future, exchanges and Coinbase would be on LN) and when the balance is too large for a hot wallet move it on chain?  Good idea - hadn't thought of that. Still don't want to see $20 fees regardless but we'll see how it goes.
Excited for LN's future, btw. I run a full BTC &amp; LN public node myself and have learned a lot. Bought myself the obligatory Blockstream stickers and also a  shirt from wearsmyliberty.

@_date: 2018-10-12 10:08:36
While that makes sense from a spam reduction standpoint, my concern is the HODLer's desire for cold storage in a hardware wallet. Say you dollar cost average by buying $100 a month/week/etc. Even with LN if these damn spammers (or just usage in general) manage to get fees back to $20 or more dollar cost averaging may not be practical. Sure you could batch your buy-ins as much as needed to get a decent ratio to the fee, but if the fee gets excessive you'll wind up with a paywall similar to brokerages requiring $X minimum to open an account.

Many nodes (including mine) set a cap on upload in a 24 hour period; mines set at 5GB per day. Once the cap is hit, the node stops sharing blocks that are more than a week old. That way it still serves the network in realtime, but doesn't get bogged down with too many newbies DLing a 250GB blockchain from 'em.
Reason I say all that is, it may work to disconnect/reconnect to nodes whenever you happen to check and see you're update progress has fallen to near zero. (You don't have to close wallet, just click that network looking icon next to the synchronizing icon in the bottom right.)  I don't know if this will work but maybe you'll reconnect to new nodes that you haven't tapped out yet by hitting their cap? This may be total B.S. or the devs may have somehow made this automatic, I'm just guessing.
P.S. Once you're synched up if you want to set your own caps and other customizations hit me up and I can help if you like - if you leave it wide open you may find yourself uploading a hell of a lot of data for a few hundred newbies come the next bull run, or YouTube video showing how to create a node or what have you.
Edit: I forgot to add that DL speed isn't always the bottleneck - for me it was either HDD write speed or CPU.

Just curious, the mempool completely clears out daily at least a few times except for congested periods here and there. During periods of unfilled blocks, do 0 fee tx's really not get added? I don't think nodes propagate 0 fee tx's by default, but I think some do and you wouldn't need many to do so.

Oh yeah I did it all. I actually made one crazy macro enabled spreadsheet that plotted your option strategies using estimates from Monte Carlo option pricing, all using VBA. Really helped me visualize how bad I sucked. Covered calls were nice for boring passive income on long-term holds, and synthetic longs and shorts were opposite end of the spectrum, where you're essentially just taking a position at 100x leverage. Good times...
Edit: I thought I was replying to the other comment about options, sorry if it seemed out of place. Taking a step back, my original comment was talking about pure stock, long and short. An Iron Condor or any other neutral option strategies would indeed be truly neutral and provide passive income but even then you often need to rebalance it if you prefer to remain neutral over time.

Generally speaking, I went on an altcoin kick in early 2018 and learned the hard way that 99% of them are garbage. Most were copies of BTC codebase first, and THEN whoever copied it tried to figure out what the hell to do with it. I think there are many specific use cases that altcoins could fulfill, but it isn't going to happen overnight and clearly everyone was just trying to rush out whatever random ideas they could think of in an attempt to get a piece of the action. I've looked at the code on GitHub for several that were literal copy/pastes of BTC Core with the only changes being to replace all instances of BTC Core with altcoin name, removing many notes regarding BTC, and a new icon/skin set. But you go to the website of the coin and it's like it's a whole new disruptive paradigm shift of an idea.
 Specifically regarding Ripple (XRP) and Dash:
XRP: I honestly think that if/when crypto gets another bull run this will go up huge, but I personally don't/won't hold any because in the US, crypto taxes are already rediculous, and XRP is most definitely a security given its structure and I don't want to deal with the ramifications of that thing until the IRS gets more familiar with crypto and figures out what in the hell they're doing.
Dash: After getting burned by several masternode altcoins and then finally taking a step back to think about the economics of masternodes, I've decided that the entire masternode concept doesn't work for these altcoins because what you are essentially doing is collecting more coins for almost no work/effort (run a VPS and call it a day). Considering mining requires expensive hardware and insane electricity bills and complicated setup, Masternodes sound great but you quickly realize that if everyone's spinning up a VPS and just collecting more coins for doing nothing, you can't ALL be rich and so the value of the coin bleeds down to recalibrate with the fact that everyone's just holding more and more coins. One final thing is from a scammer's perspective, masternodes are absolutely perfect b/c it gives miners/buyers incentive to run out and acqquire as many of this new coin as possible (insane demand) for no reason other than to hit an arbitrary number that the scammer has set as masternode collatoral. It's simply too good to pass up and these guys dump and run the second the buying fervor starts to wane. After ALL THAT, however, I have nothing against Dash and it's the only MN coin I'd take seriously at this point. I don't know much about it, but it managed to get over that initial hump to be something sustainable as an ecosystem and so while I don't have any, I wouldn't be opposed to having a stash at this point. I'm not sure what their reward structure is, but considering it's lasted this long as a larger coin by market cap, it appears that they probably have a reasonably sustainable "monetary policy" if you wanna call it that.

*Somebody help, I sent coinbase an ACH ten minutes ago and it hasn't shown up yet.

Completely disagree; generally speaking (and I fully admit this is a total assumption) all 1M+ subscribers to the Bitcoin subreddit are much more aware than the general population. Just earlier today someone posted right on here that over 30% of people think US Dollars are still backed by gold (since you mentioned Nixon). The internet has certainly allowed those that ARE aware a great medium for information sharing, but everyday people still need to choose to listen to that information.
As an example of what we take for granted, you and I both know the potential Bitcoin has. My sister, who currently attends college, mentioned Bitcoin to fellow college classmates and she said their response was "What's the point? So you can buy a fake ID?"
I only got involved in 2017 and I already feel like 2019 is late to the game, and yet hearing things like that make me think nearly 11 years post genesis block is STILL incredibly early.

On a very non-technical level I can say that every altcoin is fast/cheap transactions because at this moment nobody's using them (relatively speaking). BTC was fast/cheap when nobody was using it either.
I run a full BTC node and I can say that it's over 200GB and growing daily. I had a HDD failure (coincidence?) and after replacing the drive the reindexing of the blockchain took 6 DAYS. Remembering that this "enormous" blockchain is the one that only has a 1MB (plus SegWit) block every 10 minutes, and imagine if any of the large block (or 1 minute blocktime for that matter) coins started being used heavily.
There's no money to be made running a node, and so if you expect anyone to do it you need to make it a "side-hobby" that's essentially free using crap you have laying around, or your existing PC. Without a low barrier to entry, decentralization is threatened.

I think if BCH got hugely popular and widely adopted it would continue to function just fine because of the very large blocks, but nearly all of the nodes run by everyday people would quickly cease to function as it outgrows their computers. Not only would nodes become centralized but mining would become pretty centralised as well, as lower end computers especially those with poor internet connections would have a severe handicap against others due to the time it takes for Block propagation when the block start getting huge in size. Granted the enormous 10-minute blocktime of the Bitcoin Forks help in this regard certainly more than the one minute altcoins but it would still have an effect.

You have to download ledger's graphical program (Ledger Live) but that's to view balances and "tell the device" that you want to send funds. To receive funds you don't even have to plug the device in if you don't want to. the trickiest concept to get initially is that the crypto isn't stored on the device, only your private keys are and those are used to sign for the transactions when you send crypto. all of your actual crypto is stored on the blockchain with everybody else's; everybody can see it, they just can't touch it. Hardware wallets like The Ledger keep your private key offline and the way it's designed that private key never gets online the device itself signs for the transactions so that they can go through but it doesn't actually publish the private key anywhere.

Yes indeed.
\&gt;"If it's actually redownloading them ... some other problem on your system..."
Windows 10, but not redownloading. Bottleneck seems to be HDD hits which probably makes sense, so no issue.
\&gt;" Unless you're doing an initial sync ... you're probably fine with the default dbcache size... "
Only reason I make it unnecessarily large is because I also run Lightning alongside Core. In absolute worst cast (failed HDD requiring replacement) I'm trying to target a full sync as fast as possible to avoid "old-channel-state" attack. There may be other solutions, but I'm not sure of one. Since my bottleneck is HDD I/O and my 2nd bottleneck would be CPU, keeping an external backup of the blockchain likely wouldn't help since my download speed is not a factor? For now I simply define an adequately large value for to-remote-delay.

While it's altruistic and all, I ultimately decided not to do it because I was thinking it may open my node up to DDoS attacks. Not sure if it would be an attack on my node or BTC network as a whole. Am I thinking about that right?

Sorry but I think u/themokecameout is right on this one, although I agree that your interpretation would be the better way to enforce it. The law doesn't care what it "means to you". If that was the case, I wouldn't have to pay any crypto taxes because "to me" the IRS and SEC and everyone else who is just trying to cash in on a train they missed can kiss off.
What irritates me even more than these tax laws I'm forced to decipher and follow is the knowledge that it's single handedly getting in the way of mainstream Bitcoin adoption. I get that when I buy the proverbial coffee with Bitcoin the coins are probably worth more than when I acquired them. I can't help that - Bitcoin is money, not a stock, and I'm tired of it being treated as such.

Yes, but the point of the hardware wallets is that even though you need to be online to broadcast the transaction, the private key itself never sees the internet; it's stays on the device. I'm not sure of the exact cryptographic explanation, but in layman's terms the hardware wallet publishes a permission slip that says "Yep, I confirmed that it's this guy's funds, he's legit ".
To receive funds you don't need the wallet if you know one of your previously used receiving addresses. You don't need to prove it's your address if you're GIVING it money. It's not best practice to keep reusing addresses, but for example if mining direct to a hardware wallet it is easiest to just point your rig at one of your addresses and leave it alone.

This website shows the state of the pending transactions in the mempool. as you can see at least several times a day the chart repeatedly spikes off of 0 or near zero meaning that the blocks are not entirely full during off-peak hours. what this means for you is if you set to one Satoshi per byte you will at the very least get through during those periods. bear in mind that if we get another bull run this thing will blow to hell just like it did in December, and if that happens you will need to use higher fees if you ever want them to get through in a reasonable amount of time.

Binance consolidated a boatload of UTXOs.

Glad to see they're being responsible about it.

I used to daytrade before finding crypto - the SEC had rules for "investor protection" and most of them caused more harm than good.
\*They typically have large initial deposits in order to open accounts at brokers. That's to keep small fish from playing with their money, but all it does is encourage the small fish to borrow a chunk from the family savings in order to hit that minimum deposit, telling themselves "I just won't trade with that extra bit..." (They do.)
\*There is something called a Pattern Day Trader rule that says if you're a small fish with less than $25k invested you can't make more than 3 daytrades in a rolling 7 day window. Reasoning? To prevent people from getting in over their heads and overly zealous, blowing their entire account in a day with 500 trades.  The real outcome? Small fish start to play games with themselves, holding known bad/risky positions overnight in an attempt to "save" those Pattern Day Trade allowances like they're vacation days. You wake up the next morning to a blown position that you knew deep down you shouldn't have held overnight to begin with. But at least you didn't get dinged for a daytrade...
\*Small fish can't bet against companies (short positions). While I do understand the mathematics of how shorts have infinite potential loss while only 2X maximum gain (terrible risk/reward ratio) the fact still remains that big fish can bet for companies AND against them, and even remain neutral while passively profiting (by way of neutral options strategies) while the small fish can only try to find winners.
While I can see a weak argument toward consumer protection in all of these examples, the fact is that we (the crypto community) strongly believe that we are big boys/girls and can wipe our own a\*\*es, thank you very much.

I admit I didn't follow your links b/c I've seen "the math" many times before. Typically the error is in assuming each and every payment channel needs an on-chain tx in order to get started. Then you calculate how many payment channel funding transactions can fit in a 1MB block, stand back and go "shit".
Payment channel factories are one of several solutions being proposed. I don't know the technicals as well as the s-m-r-t folk, but suffice it to say a single on-chain tx will be able to onboard many (many, many) payment channels. The argument is completely null and void at that point.
Remember when Coinbase and Nicehash were actually giving each individual payout/withdrawal using a personal on-chain transaction for each and every person in 2017? Look at a Nicehash payout now and you'll see one input and pages upon pages of outputs in a single tx. Exchanges are batching withdrawals.
Channel factories are technically different, but same idea at a conceptual level.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:39:49

@_date: 2019-08-12 21:08:42
Calm down...
The issue with BTC's current approach is that it isn't a rolling average, it's a direct recalculation every 2016 blocks looking back at the previous 2016 blocks. This almost inevitable causes difficulty "resonance" as evidenced by nearly every shitcoin copycat out there. What happens is that once a coin’s POW algo gets on NiceHash or other profit-switching pools, you get into a cycle where one retarget is just a little bit too high or low, and suddenly you get either a massive influx or exodus of miner hashpower. This causes the subsequent retarget 2016 blocks later to SEVERELY overshoot one way or the other (limited to maximum 4X increase or ¼ decrease I think?) and once that happens, you’re pretty much stuck like that. This leads to severe degradations in security during the high diff periods when all miners leave, and in extreme cases, a complete stoppage of the blockchain, effectively killing off the project.
The ONLY reason BTC avoided this in the early days is the organic growth that Bitcoin had that can’t be duplicated since. By the time profit switching mining pools came around the hashrate was so obscenely high you didn’t have issues like this.
Why do I care then? After all, BTC has ASICs not GPU mining! Because I don’t want us all to become complacent – we came close in 2017. Miners are a greedy bunch that will drop a coin like a GD bad habit for 5% better returns. If you don’t think it could happen to BTC I’ll remind everyone that during the “Cash fork” hashpower did exactly this as miners chased profits between BTC and BCH – they didn’t give a crap about ideology, they wanted $$$/day.
See? Now you got me all riled up. I gotta go to the crypto meme subreddit to feel better.  Haha, love that roller coaster guy. He’s sideways this time!
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:23:14

It's all just decimals. One single Bitcoin could run the entire world's economy, is divisible 8 decimal places, and could even be further subdivided in the future if required.

I saw on crypto daily's YouTube channel that he said Richard Hart said that the Gap you referring to is one of the only gaps since inception that has not yet been filled if not the only Gap.
that being said, I used to day trade stocks for 10 years before getting into crypto and while the concept of filling the Gap is certainly a real thing let's be honest it doesn't actually mean anything and if Bitcoin doesn't feel like filling the Gap there's no reason why it should.
if you think about it, the concept of filling the Gap in terms of stocks is because the stock market closes overnight. While the CME closes overnight, Bitcoin doesn't, so so you have to ask yourself why Bitcoin would care about some random thing that could be considered a merchant and their business hours.
So why has every single Gap been filled, assuming Richard heart was correct? The insane volatility of Bitcoin may have something to do with it... In any given week it can cover tens of percents of movement.

Very generally speaking (not a financial adviser) you pay income tax on the BTC as you receive it (convert to USD at the time you receive it and pay income tax on that) and then that USD value also becomes your cost basis for capital gains when you get rid of the BTC later (trade for USD or buy something with BTC, which according to IRS is the same as trading BTC for USD and then buying the item with USD.)
Because the cost basis for your capital gains is the value that you already paid income tax on, you're not really paying double-taxes even though it feels like it.
Whole thing is stupid in my opinion, but consider yourself lucky. If you earn BTC continually via mining and then regularly use BTC to pay for everyday things all year long while rolling over some portion of BTC as savings every year, I have NO IDEA how you would track that per my above understanding.

You can probably use a HTLC, but I don't know how to do that personally.

Ah, forgot about the backup pack - I got mine in 2017 so I missed that one. Really what they're doing is dumping their supply of Nano S's now that they have the X, so it's a win-win. If I was buying now for the first time I'd definitely go with the backup pack.

If you have more than $500 worth of crypto you need a hardware wallet. Coinbase just stopped a very sophisticated attack attempt, so clearly people are trying to get in there.  [ 
I only have experience with Ledger Nano S. It works fine, but can only hold about 3 different types of crypto. If you have more than that, there's teh Ledger Nano X. It holds more coins, but has bluetooth capability. That's an extra bonus and also an extra attack vector, depending on how you look at it.
I would not buy a Ledger from anywhere other than the official website. I'm sure Amazon is fine also, but I would want the complete peace of mind that comes with no middlemen. Crypto makes you paranoid...
 [ 
Trezor is the other option and I've heard they're equally good (technically, Trezor came before Ledger) but I've never used one so I can't speak to it.

If you think about the format, it was destined to fail to the internet. Newspapers have fixed real estate on a page regardless of the amount of news that day/week, so you have to jump around, and have filler stories. Websites are dynamic. Similarly, news on TV has fixed time to fill, and YouTube et al have clickable links to videos that are just long enough to tell the story and then you move on.
The amount of time I got back in my life from these efficiency improvements is staggering. Good thing I squander it all running my mouth on Reddit! :-)

Yeah I feel like people can't handle not having a captain. I think that's why some cling to Satoshi more than they should.
I honestly don't know where that 18 months meme came from. Granted, I started my node a year ago when it was already decently underway (about 1000 nodes) but looking back it seemed like if you took the time to actually look for progress there was always some incremental advancements along the way. Sure it's still a long way from prime time, but in my 1 year so far I've seen lots of feature improvements from where it was when I started.

See for a low-activity HODLer that is almost a deal breaker because an S (no battery) needs to be plugged in every time you use it, and if you only crack it out every 6 months or so, you're plugging in the X each time as well.
On the flipside, if you actually intend on using it to secure everyday payments via mobile phone, the X is in an absolute class by itself, but my personal approach is the old savings/checking analogy whereby I have cold storage, and some spending money on a mobile (hot) wallet so again the X isn't necessary.

Well there's a bit of a story there - my BTC Core and Lightning Node run on a dedicated PC I built exclusively using parts from 4 computers that were slated for recycling at work. Bear in mind that this means they were deemed too old even for spare parts. The CPU is dual-core... Seems like hitting the HDD is the bottleneck for me. Once it's synced, though, both the BTC node as well as the Lightning node run great with minimal resource usage. My LN node has routed over 3k transactions over the last year! :-)
Just out of curiosity, do you happen to know the sync time of a high-end modern gaming PC? I'm just curious what's considered fast.
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:31:27
Serious question - I do think you're spot on with your plan in that if people come down hard on BTC, severely affecting its fungibility, Monero may very well "moon". But aren't you worried that BTC may simply absorb the privacy aspects that are already being proven out by the privacy coins? If that happened I feel like all privacy coins would flash crash so damn fast...
I don't know the technicals but I feel like it's a case where BTC "could" do it whenever they feel like it at this point but it's not worth the risk of trying it. Yet.

His example shows an immutable cencorship resistant transaction, nothing more. From a pure energy efficiency standpoint, PayPal et al would work FAR better. That's just a byproduct of centralization.

It was the weekend?
Historically it seems to me that the blockchain is over capacity (mempool increasing) during the business hours of New York City timezone. After business hours, we're no longer at capacity (mempool begins to drain) and over the weekend it gets enough time to drain completely. Sometimes it fully clears out over weeknights, but it's never a guarantee. Now that it's Monday, the mempool is already filling and will likely continue to do so all day.

As someone who has BTC, LTC and runs a Lightning Node alongside BTC Core, I see the payments clear on Lightning even faster than swiping a credit card.
In 2017, LTC was great for actually moving crypto around without paying BTC's stupid-high fees. But the writing is on the wall and although Lightning is nowhere near ready for real-world use, I really struggle to see what LTC will have to offer us in the future at all.

Thank you very much for the explanation - I agree I think I will sweep the funds during low mempool activity.
If Eclair doesn't support sweeping funds (not sure) I also have a BTC Core node that presumably does. Failing that, I'll stick with my original plan of a generic on-chain payment to myself since that's similar to sweeping anyway.
It sounds like "importing" keys is akin to having multiple accounts within a single wallet, which is not what I'd want.

Yeah the .004 BTC is your TOTAL fee for the transaction, not the fee rate (in satoshis per byte, or technically in satoshis per kilobyte since it looks like you're using BTC core, so divide by 1000 to get sats/byte if you care to know what it is.)
0.004 BTC transaction fee seems extremely high, however you had mentioned that you were mining to this wallet. Depending on how frequently the payouts were, I could imagine emptying the balance of your wallet would be a very memory-heavy (i.e. large in kb) transaction.
Even if this is an urgent transaction for security reasons, the mempool is currently empty and 1 sat/byte (1000 sat/kilobyte) will easily confirm quickly.
See here for where to set it. This example shows 1 satohsi per byte (1000 sat per kb). Enable Replace-By-Fee so that you have the option to increase the fee later if it doesn't get confirmed quickly.

I'm really excited for merchant adoption (which admittedly plays into exactly what you said). I have a Lightning-enabled mobile wallet, with a channel to my own LN node, which is connected to my BTC Core node… with nothing to buy. I literally waste a few satoshis here and there just to keep my node active. I “would” go help a local merchant get set up accepting Bitcoin, except I can’t even figure out BTCPayServer myself. Someday I hope to have an online store that will certainly accept BTC from the onset, but it’s a long way off.

A lot of suggestions for RasPi and that probably IS the best way to go, however if you want to go 100% cheap-as-free dig up old PC parts and make a dedicated tower. I’m running a full node (and Lightning Node) using a PC I built using 4 old computers they were recycling at work. I use remote desktop software on my phone or work PC to manage it since it has no monitor, and the only money I actually put into it is a hard drive big enough\* for the blockchain.
\*If you really want to go cheap, technically Win10 allows you to take a bunch of small HDD’s and format them as 1 big one. I really wouldn’t trust this because if any of the drives fail the whole thing fails, and the drives are by definition old ones you have lying around so they’re ticking time bombs anyway.
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:44:13
Thanks for the great explanation!
I run a full node with open port, and a LN node. I admit though, that while I use my full node to verify that transactions to/from that specific wallet confirm, I don't really know how to get my various other wallets (mobile wallet, hardware wallet, etc) to "use" my own full node on the backend, and in some cases perhaps you can't?
At the very least, if you have a txID for an unrelated tx (say, I send BTC from my mobile wallet to my hardware wallet without involving my full node) can I input the txID somewhere and check the status in my full node?

I agree with all of that, and his 4/7 tweet pretty much says what I previously said about "difficulty resonance" but he said it better. As far as a new retargeting algorithm, there's a bunch of alternatives that have been used by altcoins that suffered this issue, first one that comes to mind is Dark Gravity Wave, implemented when Ravencoin had the issue. (Likely used elsewhere previously - I don't follow many alts). It seemed to work perfectly, but I'm not sure if BTC needs it at this point. I'd be all for rolling it in for good measure though.

I also heard of a sponsor on YouTube channel [BTCsessions]( for [ledn.io]( which is some kind of loan for CAD or USD with BTC as collateral. Ben made it sounds like it's limited in the US but I've never looked into that either. I have enough debt as it is... ;-)

I should point out that if you unknowingly open one (or many) channels and HODL and never spend any, if your node is a "full/routing/whateveryoucallthem" Lightning node someone else could open a channel with you with their funds. As soon as that happens you'll start routing transactions and all your channels will start migrating funds around and the offline risk would manifest.
I guess if you open a channel and then go offline, you're fine because then nobody could connect to you?

Well, am I correct in saying that the issuance portion of the code doesn't care whether or not the BTC was claimed after it was awarded?

I use Eclair mobile wallet, FWIW. It's non-custodial but because of that the ONE downside for newcomers is that it's not straightforward how to receive payments right away until after you spend some money first. If you're planning on spending more than buying, it shouldn't be an issue.
I can help set it up if you decide to go this route.

hmmm - seems like C-lightning and Eclair handle that part differently, so my approach won't help you I guess. For Eclair there is no provided address/wallet or anything - you configure the config file for the QT wallet to talk to Eclair via RPC and Eclair simply manages payment channels, using BTC Core's qt wallet only for onchain transactions. If you create a .1BTC payment channel in Eclair, you simply see .1BTC automatically sent out from your qt wallet, and a similar deposit directly into your qt wallet when you close a channel.

I read the whole thing just to hear someone who isn't a puppet cheerleader. I think the meme-loving-Lambo-wanting newbies just drown out the people who actually believe in bitcoin, but there's plenty of level headed people here.
Nobody knows what the price will do, but in my opinion no amount of math based on market cap, etc can be used because we're all forgetting one major thing: It IS possible to lose your coins, and it ISN'T possible to get them back if/when you screw up. That single point right there makes any predictions based on math go right out the window because "technically" we could wind up with a single bitcoin in existence 100 years from now because so many people have screwed up.

The other page you mention is for the BCH fork that happened mid-2017. If you've been a HODLer for 3 years and haven't touched it, you may actually have an equal number of both coins and not even know it.
Not to sound ridiculous, but one huge strength of Bitcoin was that it’s first mover advantage allowed a sort of “immaculate conception” in the sense that it had time to grow while nobody gave a crap about it. Nowadays cryptocurrency is “a thing” and anytime a new one comes along all eyes are on it immediately. This leads to a few problems:
It’s likely impossible at this point to get out of obscurity (2,494 altcoins listed on CMC alone) without a leader pushing innovation and marketing for a coin. Pick any altcoin and you can pinpoint at least one key figure, or at the very least some kind of “board of directors”. That’s a HUGE weak link due to human greed, a target for regulators, a target for persuasion, etc. BTC was founded by Satoshi, who disappeared long before too many people cared.
At least so far, Proof of Work seems to be the best security model for crypto, not Proof of Stake or Proof of Proof (which is really the security of some other Proof of Stake). Bitcoin had years to grow during periods of CPU mining, GPU mining, and now ASICs. I’ve seen countless altcoins in the 2017 boom get thrashed while growing because their nethash just wasn’t there yet, and there are new predatory mining environments that just weren’t around in 2009. Things like NiceHash and profit switching pools didn’t even exist in the early days of Bitcoin. Now, it’s commonplace for lower nethash coins to get caught in a “difficulty resonance” if they blindly copied BTC’s diff adjustment algorithm. The smart alts changed their diff retarget strategy to something more responsive before total collapse of the network.
At this point the only way I could see BTC being usurped would be if someone legitimately found a more scalable solution that also used less energy to secure the network. Based on our current understanding of thermodynamics/technology this simply doesn’t seem possible, but I refrain from speaking in absolutes. There are many coins out there that claim to scale better but not one of them did so without sacrificing SOMETHING in the way of decentralization or security, regardless of what they tell you (larger blocks, faster blocks, DAGs, etc). I’m NOT going to claim it’s impossible, though.
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:44:30
No problem! No downvote here; There's a difference between a troll and someone who's simply having an opinion and not blindly drinking the Kool-aid on any given sub. :-)
In my example, the kids would have to download and fund any Lightning compatible mobile BTC wallet. Then you create a channel with a node of your choosing by clicking "create channel". You then scan the QR code of the node (mine is linked above for example). Many wallets that prioritize ease of use over user control do this step for you and manage the channels automatically. This is an on-chain tx, but since your doing this as part of a setup process in advance you'd be crazy to pay more than 1sat/byte because it's not typically time sensitive. You now are ready to spend at will on Lightning for sub-satoshi fees (total, not per byte!)
Because the kids are using Lightning for selling stuff and not buying stuff, they need to do one additional step, because the new channel that was created with their money now has all of the money on their side, since it is by definition their money. They need to somehow "push" money to my side (the node) without physically handing me free money. Two easiest ways to do this are to either spend some money by using the wallet as usual and it'll balance out naturally, or if you're a merchant who will likely earn more than they spend you're best bet at the moment is to go to some site like ZigZag who make a business of sorting this out for you and charging a small fee. Obviously the easier of the 2 options is the one that isn't free.
In my personal case I'm running my own node but I also have a mobile wallet, so all I had to do was create a $200 channel to my own node, and then pay $100 to my node from the wallet. I now have $100 to spend and $100 to receive, but again that's only practical if you happen to have your own node.
As you can see it's not the smoothest process right now but it's technically sound and ease of use will certainly come with time. I have a guy connected to my node who made some kind of script that sends thousands of micropayments all over the place and I see his traffic as my node relays his payments. I charge him 1e-11 BTC (.001 satoshis) fee for every 1 BTC routed, which for all intents and purposes is free.
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:28:35
I'm sure you already know about this optional line in the config file, but if you set yours to 33000 you'd cap at 33GB per day which is about 1TB per month (obviously factor in other personal usage into your 1TB limit)
\# Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target (in MiB per 24h), 0 = no limit.

Here, look at this: [
Starting Feb 2018 I was mining every altcoin that was GPU mineable. I also earned BTC via NiceHash. I had a pretty diversified mix, and didn't sell anything. The pie chart is their current value (16 different cryptos), so you decide which coin was the best bet.

One thing I thought of: Not sure how mini-PCs handle CPU cooling. If it's just a passive heat sink with no fan you would be fine during normal use but the initial sync would probably get a bit warm as the CPU chugs away for days on end. Maybe open the case and point a desk fan at it until it's caught up? I'm sure someone on reddit runs a node on a miniPC so hopefully someone can chime in.

I dunno - I'm sure there's more to the thread, but in that screenshot you come off as far more aggressive than the Bcasher. The Bcash argument for longterm mining subsidy is that 100+MB blocks full of 1sat/byte payments will be a decent chunk of money just like a 1MB block full of 100sat/byte tx's.
Don't get me wrong, I sold all my BCH for BTC the moment I could - I'm just saying that mining subsidy isn't the checkmate we're looking for. (We have plenty of others, haha)

Lightning node operator here (platform9and3quarters):
The Lightning Network is indeed extremely convoluted and no remotely average individual can properly manage it at the moment unless you’re willing to settle for custodial solutions. None of that matters if you can see beyond the present.  Merchant adoption is even more sparse than BTC itself at the moment, but the payments that I do make are instant and the (total) fees are measured sub-satoshi, typically about 300millisats (300e-11 BTC). Again, the present doesn’t matter – I see with my own eyes that it works as intended and now it just needs adoption.
As far as main-chain blocksize, there is a parasite called Veriblock that routinely uses nearly a third of the bandwidth to add security to shitcoins by leveraging our “real” blockchain. They run until fees hike up too much and then they are no longer viable and back off until it’s viable again. If we made the block limit 100 MB they would run indefinitely until people notice their success, and competition shows up against them. Then we have full 100 MB blocks full of nonsense and we’re back to paying tx fees over $1. Nothing has changed, fees are still $1, but now we can’t run nodes because the blockchain is measured in TB.
BTC blocks aren’t full simply b/c of a size limit. They’re full because people use it. I don’t know of a single alt (except maybe ETH with all of that data) that actually could come close to 1MB average blocks (real use, not some theoretical max).
Switching to decaf now…

Using RBF (replace by fee) it is technically possible for the buyer to re-spend his coins elsewhere while you're still waiting for that first confirmation, thereby pulling the rug out from under you. You'd be best to wait for 1 or 2 confirmations just to feel confident that he's not trying to pull that on purpose, and 6+ confirmations if you want to be reasonably sure that it's "impossible" to undue the transaction.
I'll throw this out there: Typical online merchants don't mind waiting a long time for confirmations since the next step is to physically ship something, which takes forever anyway. You're running a business selling in-game items, which are digital and could theoretically be delivered immediately. Therefore, your customers may get tired of waiting. They could use higher transaction fees, but the Lightning Network would suit your business model better than on-chain transactions. Since the payments are instant, you could even make the transactions live during gameplay (see PenguinShooter and other Lightning games for example. You buy weapon upgrades and spawn enemies etc.)
Don’t get me wrong – Lightning is very early and your customers likely don’t even have wallets that support Lightning, but there are quite a few wallets that do. I use Eclair personally. I probably wouldn’t migrate yet unless you like early adopter stuff, but just letting you know that it’s out there so you can keep an eye on it and decide for yourself.

Your entire comment is focusing on static values at present time. The actual value isn't the concern, but rather the fact that it's going up with no sign of stopping.

Your post is from 2 hours ago and you mention "for several hours" and so your time period is likely in the red boxed region. Notice that, unless you paid the highest fee at the time, you likely got buried immediately and continued to do so. We are now in a period of low activity and the miners are catching up (blue arrow). You'll confirm very soon if you haven't already.
\*Generally speaking the backlog follows a common pattern: It is worst during business hours in New York City's timezone, and has low activity at all other times, during which the miners are digging themselves out of a backlog.

I run a full BTC node as well as a Lightning Network node, and I'm a Goddamn idiot.
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:21:43
I would think so - based on my experience the disk space is the only "significant" system requirement. My lightning network node has routed well over three thousand payments all while running BTC Core node alongside it syncing the blockchain, and the PC is pretty much idle.
That initial syncing of the blockchain is a %$ though. I had to re-do it a few weeks ago b/c I corrupted my block data and it took 6 full days to catch back up. A high end PC can do it in half a day. Typically the drive seeking is the bottleneck, not internet bandwidth. A SSD would help immensely but that’s extra money for speeding up a step that you should only have to do once anyway.
I should add that if you allow inbound connections from peer nodes, you could find yourself feeding several newcomers with the 275GB blockchain history when they get started. To avoid irritating your ISP you may want to put a daily cap on that data. Your node will still provide realtime blockchain data to the network, but will stop serving up old stuff once the limit is hit for that day. Mine’s set for 5GB daily and I’ve confirmed that it actually works. Throw these in your configuration file if you want to do that:
\# Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target (in MiB per 24h), 0 = no limit.
\ inbound + outbound connections (outbound is 8)

I started in crypto in 2017 flipping BTC like a stock and making sweet capital gains.
I completely cashed out of crypto last day of 2017 and began mining and HODLing, thinking to someday sell for lots of USD.
After a year and a half of HODLing and educating myself, I'm seriously starting to believe this meme:  [ 
I'm now HODLing, running a full node, Lightning node, and working on starting a business that will certainly accept BTC.
But I just can't stop clicking anything with CSW's name in the headline.
@_date: 2019-08-26 19:58:12
I like your enthusiasm ;-)
I agree with most of that, my biggest struggle is deciding how much to HODL in my Lightning Node vs a hardware wallet. Hardware wallet is certainly far safer as a store of value, however much like you describe of the BTC:USD market, such is the tx fee market. We just don't know what will happen and I fear enthusiasm and FOMO will likewise drive tx fees to astronomical highs, where we'll be glad to have set up those payment channels in 2018/2019 for 1sat/byte.
Hopefully, if tx fees are approaching $500/byte it's only because BTC is worth a lot of USD, so it should be irreverent. This is all theory, though.

Been doing my own US based crypto taxes for 2 years now, but I'm just a dude not a financial advisor: specifically in your example, the values are too small to legally require you to report anything.
Since your talking about a loss, doing the taxes would actually help you (you get deductions for losses, but pay taxes if you have gains). But again assuming the numbers you used in your example it's not going to even be worth your time bothering to file that.

1. Until quantum computing comes along brute forcing isn't likely in several lifetimes - the permutations are staggeringly huge.
2. It will be interesting to see how a deflationary asset plays out - has strengths and downsides but I also wonder if it'll discourage spending.
3. Only if you make blocks enormous and don't let a fee market develop; see blocksize (\*\*ocksize) arguments all over the interwebz.
4. Because the unit of Bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimal places, and once you start playing with Lightning Network you're down to 11 decimal places. 1 BTC doesn't mean anything, it's just 1\*10\^8 satoshis. There are plenty of satoshis to last us and even if we somehow manage to mess that up it could "technically" be subdivded even further if need be. We'll never "run out" of payment units.
5. It is a giant circlejerk. I'll probably get downvoted to hell but although nobody likes FUDsters the majority of bitcoinreddit and bitcointwitter is back-patting. Using the \*\*ocksize debate as an example, I totally understand that small blockers are technically correct, but many of them go on to say "there is no problem" regarding the mempool. YES IT IS A FUCKING PROBLEM. Having a problem that can't be solved by the bigblockers arguments does not mean there is no problem. The Lightning Network and other solutions will hopefully solve the mempool issue, but bigblockers are absolutely 100% correct that the jacked up mempool of 2017 completely fucked over our first mover advantage and we lost all merchant adoption. Maybe we get it back someday, but we're really playing with fire every year that BTC is congested. We're getting cocky. Last weekend I had dinner with 2 people who were genuinely interested in Bitcoin and asked me to email them the whitepaper to check out. When I emailed them, I wanted to include a mobile wallet, and the promise that when they send me a public key I will send each of them .001 BTC to play with. I thought it was a great idea until I sat down to write the email, and tried to pick a wallet to suggest to them. I personally use a BTC Core full node, a Lightning Network Node, and Eclair Lightning enabled mobile wallet. I suddenly realized that they won't understand how to use a Lightning wallet because RECEIVING payments is still too complicated over Lightning. So I offered them HODL wallet, which is on-chain only. It's only a matter of time before they accidentally send part of their .001 BTC to each other with default tx fees in the middle of a workday when fees are over a buck. They will then stop learning about BTC. THAT IS A FUCKING PROBLEM. Christ... sorry I got all riled up it's just that this circle jerk pisses me off. There will be plenty of time to be smug AF when we get BTC usable again. It will happen, we just need to stop pretending we're already there.
6. Yes and Yes.

"The Spedn app was built on the open Flexa network, which acts as an intermediary between merchants and the blockchain, and requires no point-of-sale upgrades for merchants."
As I've said before, if the merchant just accepts fiat without even knowing that you're using crypto, it does nothing for adoption. It just allows all of us to actually use our money, but we're already committed to this cause anyway.

Do you really need to create a new account? I enabled the checkbox to utilize Bech32 in settings. After a restart for good measure, couldn't I just create a new receiving address, which I assume would then be Bech32 compatible, and during a period of empty mempool just transfer all existing balance to that new address to update (as well as consolidate) my funds?
EDITED: Yes, you need to create a new account. All the new receiving addresses I mentioned would be created using the original seed and so they would not be upgraded Bech32 addresses.

" Theres a couple chains that offer at least a comparable level of security"
Apparently Veriblock doesn't think so. (I don't know anything about them so I can't give a real answer, however.)
"LN...major players": I'm just a guy with a 5-GPU mining rig and I'm running the 138th largest node at the moment! You are correct that it ties up funds, and I'll admit I get a little twitchy if I tie up decent BTC with someone who appears inactive for a month... I think of it this way: Assuming you're HODLing, you may as well park it here since it's not doing much good or earning you interest anyway, and you get the benefit of nearly zero fees.
All that being said if you're a HODLer and not interested in making a 2nd career as a sys-admin you can't beat the security and convenience of a hardware wallet until this tech becomes more user-friendly and the security's been proven over a longer period of time.

I don't bother, because looking at the BTC hashrate you can quickly see that whatever it says today is just the beginning.
I wasn't trying to start the whole BTC ecological debate that's gone on before though, I just found it funny that when someone mentioned "wasting electricity" the miner completely missed the question because the only thing on the mind was calculated profit. And again, I'm just poking fun at that fact - I mine myself so I'm not "holier than thou".

As it is, if you leave defaults of 1sat base + 100millionths proportional, you won't route a damn thing. It's par for the course right now to have 0 base and 1millionths.
I'm connected AF, running 0 + 0.9millionths, and I'm lucky if I route 10 tx daily. You can change the defaults to whatever you want - if you don't practically free you aren't routing.

A 15% move in a few hours is notable even for BTC. I’ll be honest; I don’t check the price anymore unless I see that stupid roller coaster guy (up or down). Saves me the bother. It’s had far fewer false-positives than financial news headlines…
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:01:40
I think it has to do with the fact that BTC is Exahashes worth of POW mining, and most altcoins are a 51% attack waiting to happen. I think they somehow stake snapshots of blockchain states into BTC's blockchain, effectively leeching off of the security of BTC that they could never get with mining themselves. I used to phrase it as "leeching off of security they didn't earn" but they ARE paying the same tx fees that we are, and so they're paying their dues. They're just pissing us all off in the process by bidding up the fees.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:19:39
Full disclosure; it wasn't a perfectly equal mix. My target was 1/3 BTC, 1/3 ETH &amp; LTC, and remaining 1/3 all kinds of altcoins. So really BTC was meant to be 1/3 of the portfolio all along, but still it's pretty much the only one that didn't totally die on me.

Seems to be above my head, however a quick look seems to show that you may not need a "Hashed Timelock Contract" like what is found in Lightning. You may only need a TimeLock. Not sure if that's something you can do in the command window (console) of a Core Node or what.
 [

This may scare you away, but up to ya: "It is not advised to lock up bitcoins into the far future because it takes on risk of the bitcoin network changing. For example, if there were an ECDSA or RIPEMD160 algorithm break that made any coins spendable with a few months of CPU time, the network might need to to prohibit moving old unspent coins after some transition, but long locktimed coins could not make such a transition.

I would guess that given the volatility of BTC you won't see anything with the time horizon's you're talking about for a very long time.

That it's barely in alpha but people the world over are critiquing it like it's a final product. I'm a top 100 node and it's a giant PITA waiting around for the mempool to clear on a weekend to add any new channels. It causes me more frustration than benefit right now because nobody's actually using it. Even at 1sat/byte to open a channel I often don't see ROI because I charge near-zero fees to relay payments for others. Why? Because damn near every other node operator is an enthusiasts who just wants to get involved and we've all undercut each other to hell!
Then you get the naysayers latching on to that and saying "see? It's not even worth it to run a node!" because they actually think that the current state of a bunch of enthusiasts will have the same market dynamics 10 years from now. Then they conclude that it doesn't work. I'm honestly tired of arguing with them and will just keep my head down and build my node.
I went off on a tangent. What was the question again?

 If you want to go back to watching your mainstream television so that you think that your voice matters worth a shit in an election, go right ahead. I did vote and the choice was Trump or Hillary. I watched all of the debates; I don't have time for any more bullshit than that. I had friends that voted libertarian in the final election. In their heads they thought that they were voting for the right choice, completely ignoring the game theory of the fact that only a Democrat or Republican can ever, and will ever, win in modern America. Voting for anyone other than Trump or Hillary was a complete cop-out. You weren't making a stand to pick the lesser of two evils, you sat on the sidelines and it was a bad move. Trump is a dipshit, but if you don't like it you can fuck right off.

none of my other friends run Bitcoin nodes and one of them even laughed at the 250GB requirement implying that his computer is way more than capable of handling that.

If you're not already a subscriber to r/Bitcoin you're not going to care enough to run the thing in the background all the time.
Now that I said that, I realize r/Bitcoin has over 1M subscribers and yet most aren't running nodes so I guess the real question is for you guys!

I'll jump in just to add that although it’s not as uncommon as you’d think for a single block to be orphaned due to a “close race” on the latest mined block, even if your tx was mined into a block and then suddenly that block became orphaned, your tx goes right back into mempool. If your fee was enough to get you into that last (now orphaned) block, chances are good you’re getting into the next one anyway.

KYC stands for "Know your customer" and is a law in USA and probably other larger countries where you can't do business with people without knowing who they are (i.e. for Coinbase you had to submit all kinds of identity, just like you would if you joined a bank.)
The law is in place to prevent terrorism and whatever else, but I just see it as one giant list of future targets 30 years from now when there's an inevitable security breach and all of our IDs are handed on a silver platter as people who got into crypto early. I've used Coinbase as well so I'm in the same boat as you. "Generally speaking" if you live in US there's not really many options to get BTC safely/legally without giving up  your ID.

Well over 90% of my USD value in crypto is BTC, don't get me wrong. Honestly most of my ETH and LTC are just sentimental at this point b/c I got in mid-2017 when it was pretty much "Coinbase and the big three".
LTC is completely superfluous at this point, and I think the thing people misunderstand about ETH is that the Ether that you buy is what allows the Ethereum network to operate, but that DOESN'T necessarily mean anything about the future USD value of that Ether. Bitcoin is designed to be valuable; Ethereum is doing something totally different and unrelated. Buying and HODLing Ether in the hopes of selling it for more USD down the road doesn't even make fundamental sense once you think about what Ethereum does. (Same argument for XRP but I won't even go there...)

THAT is indeed one of the checkmates, and you're correct.
Here's what happens in practice, though: They have "theoretically" large blocks. That's just referring to the cap defined in the code. In real world usage, the blocks are FAR less than 1MB in size on average because nobody's using it. So they continue to point out that "large blocks are working fine". Even a stress test is a short term blip that adds nearly nothing to the bloat in the long term.
I'm slowly realizing why small blockers don't defend against the accusations as rigorously as I used to think they should. It's because it's downright exhausting arguing against arguments that aren't even solid arguments in the first place.

Bitcoin's DAA isn't good and doesn't work if you started it fresh today. Tons of garbage copy/paste altcoins found this out the hard way in what I call a “difficulty resonance” but is often called a “NiceHash attack” since that’s generally how it plays out.
The issue is this: You spend 2016 blocks not adjusting anything at all, and then setting a new difficulty based on nothig but average stats from the last 2016 blocks. When a coin is new (weak) it’s trivial for a big player to simply rent out a decent chunk of hashpower and command a sizeable portion of the nethash. They collect block rewards like crazy, meanwhile the DAA is sitting around on its hands doing nothing. Then 2016 blocks into the craziness, it suddenly wakes up and actually does something, at which point the big player finds it unprofitable and leaves. Now the DAA has completely overcompensated and left reliable miners holding the bag while digging out of hopelessly high difficulty with inadequate hashpower. This does not resolve itself, but rather creates a profitability cycle in resonance, where with every 2016 blocks the swing is actually larger than the previous, until (assuming you’re still following BTC’s DAA) you reach a generic swing cap of 4X to the upside or ¼ to the downside.
I’m pretty clsoe to BTC maximalists and don’t typically bash it, but anyone who works in any field involving control systems can easily tell you it’s a piss poor system. The only reason BTC got away with it is the “virgin birth” or whatever you like to call it, where it spent its weak infancy days completely unknown by nearly the entire world until it built up a nethash large enough to stave off literally anyone. That simply won’t fly nowadays with wahttomine, coinmarketcap, NiceHash, etc. preventing any coin from flying under the radar until it’s established.

Honestly I've never been able to get the site to work, but if it works for you I'll try again.
EDIT: I tried it again a week later and although it initially still failed, we got the transaction completed through customer support and they were great. I'll definitely be trying them again in the future.
It's just a guess at this point, but several different lightning services seem to be affected when the on-chain transaction involved gets stuck in mempool for days (I'm cheap and use 1 to 3 sat/B for anything not urgent). I've even had this problem with channel creation in Lightning itself. Just another factor to consider for anyone who's a Lightning dev!

Whichever makes them the most money off of your money.
To actually answer your question for real (although I'm not a financial advisor, this is just my understanding after doing my crypto taxes for 2 years): they treat it as a property, you can think of it like stock trading if you do any of that. You have capital gains or capital losses on it, which would normally be fine, until you start trying to actually use BTC to pay for anything as if it's, you know, actual money. Good luck figuring out the cost basis of the several-years-held BTC that you used to buy that coffee, and then remembering that you already took that BTC off the table when you buy your second cup of coffee later and have to figure out your cost basis on that...
EDIT: I didn't originally catch that you were thinking about mining it. That's subject to income tax as well. At least you can write off your mining rig as a depreciating asset over 5 years, which will help alleviate the income tax until you achieve ROI of your rig. (Original comments about capital gains and coffee still apply, and this whole thing is probably far more nuanced than my simple answer can cover for everyone's situation.)

If you explicitly define your own tx fee would this error prevent you from spending? I know some people need faster confirmation times but I always force 1sat/byte (1000sat/kilobite in Core, technically)
@_date: 2019-10-19 00:22:57
Hmmm... That probably explains why nobody uses it in blogs/medium posts. I was wondering why everyone was missing something I thought was so obvious, and instead coming up with strange analogies that seemed overly confusing.
I know I'm really stretching here but although you're technically right, one could be a die-hard BTC maximalist to the point of not even trusting BTC itself if it's not settled on-chain and buried deep behind some good old fashioned blocks. With a mindset like that, I'd consider it "settling up" upon a channel closure.
Now, before you go calling that fuzzy logic crazy, bear in mind we literally just had a vunerability fix  on all 3 implementations that would have made things a lot less atomic if they'd have been exploited.
EDITED to say that I may have missed your point of you were saying that as long as you've spent some money in a channel it's not possible for you to go and spend it somewhere else. In the case of a bar tab, I suppose you could go and max your card out by online shopping while drunk at the bar and then be unable to settle your tab....

Well, I can attest that higher fees are needed for Lightning Nodes to be viable - I've been running for well over a year and lose money constantly. You collect satoshis here and there routing for practically nothing, and every single time any channel closes on you for any reason, it wipes out everything you've earned and then some.
That being said, I don't think now is the time for higher LN fees because the blockchain isn't even at capacity. A 1sat/byte on-chain tx clears in no more than 12 hours typically. Although there are cases where people need to pay dearly for next-block confirmations, generally speaking Lightning doesn't have the justification to charge much right now if on-chain can get by on 1sat/byte.

Here's my node if you want to try me instead since I'm well connected and can see for myself that my node is currently up and running:
If you don't want to connect to me, some known huge ones on 1ML are ASINQ, rompert, and LNBig among others.
EDIT: got the video and it was ASINQ so nevermind my above comment...
I use Eclair but never used the "connection only" approach - I always just fund a channel, which has a delay while you wait for the funding transaction to clear.

I'm 100% certain that we will have another 2017 style bull run and mempool will once again hit complete lockup just like last time and we're going to look really stupid, as BTC won't work for any of the newbies trying it out. Devs want to play the long-game and I get it, but to pretend "there's no problem here" is a little bit silly.
Someone had a good point, though, using Veriblock as an example. Veriblock works as a business model right now b/c of low fees. If fees went up a bit, Veriblock would die off. If we had large empty blocks, all that means is that more things "like" Veriblock would be practical, and as people invent these services we'd just fill up whatever blocks we had. So instead of bitching about Veriblock, we'd be bitching about a whole ecosystem of spammy garbage, while still paying 100sat/byte for real payments, AND churning through several more GB per day running a node. It's a bit of a stretch with a sprinkle of excuses, but sorta makes sense.

Long-term, the 1B newbies will never see the blockchain in the first place. Coinbase et al will be on LN, as well as many exchanges, and wallets will all be LN capable. Looking even beyond that, all the LN "stuff" will be pushed into the background hidden behind the GUI, once things move out of beta and are more established. There will be people that buy BTC, HODL it, and sell/spend it years later without even realizing they never even touched the blockchain a single time. (There will also be rolling hills...

Oh, no sorry. there's a technical reason why you probably won't be able to find anything that does (except for third-party custodial solutions).

are you sure one address isn't the payment you were trying to make, a second address is the mining fee, and the third address is just the change you received?
 Bitcoin transactions work like bills, where if you try to buy something for $21 you have to give them a 20 and a 5 and then receive $4 bills in change. if your wallet tells you that you have 1/4 of a Bitcoin what you really have is a whole pile of denominations of Bitcoin in different addresses that add up to 1/4 but when you go to buy something, it finds the closest match but usually can't find exact change.

At one point the Winklvoss twins had something like 1% of the total supply, and those are real dudes that are well known and could sell at any time, and nobody cares. Sure 5% is 5x more than even that, but if nobody cares about 1% then saying 5% is a catastrophy is a bit of a hard sell.

Check out the actual site to play around with various DCA strategies. All I was saying is that even if you stated DCA-ing at the worst possible time you're still doing ok, and if you started literally any other time you'd be doing even better. Word of warning - it looks like the site is no longer maintained and doesn't have historical BTC data for the last few months, but at least it goes back 9 years otherwise.

Lightning Network is even less if you want to bother with that, although it's still very early stages. Check out my fees - I routinely pay so little that it rounds to 0 sats TOTAL for the transaction (typically it's a few millisats, which is 1/1000 of a satoshi.)

Maybe I'm missing something but I feel that since it's always possible for someone to permanently lose their BTC through all manner of landmines and mistakes the theoretical maximum USD value of BTC is by definition unlimited. If every single day a small handful of people can lose BTC, but nobody can ever "un-lose" BTC, then the total supply will just go down infinitely. In a theoretical extreme case there could one day be only a single Bitcoin for the whole world worth trillions of USD and we're all running around with micro-satoshis.

you should play penguin shooter, it's a little demo game that just came out last week that uses in game micro payments to showcase lightning. I played it for fun until I did pretty much everything you can do in the game. I spent about 23,000 satoshis by the time I was done, which is about $0.07. every single transaction in the game was instant. 5 months ago it took me about a dozen tries to buy a simple t-shirt online using the lightning network. it is moving fast.

Totally agree, but they're already here now.  Actually...... is that still true? I thought I've read that one of the futures offerings closed shop due to lack of interest (CBOE, CME?) and that it was a cash-settled one. Now I'm not sure if they're ARE any currently operational cash-settled futures.

Not too burst your bubble, but when I started trading years ago I did the math and realized that no matter how much money you started with, you'd wind up a millionaire if you could just manage a single % gain each day. Don't get greedy, just eek out 1% daily and you'll be fine.
Well, sheeeeet. It didn't work that way. You can have 20 decent days in a row and all it takes is one shitstorm of a day to blow it all to hell.
Here's more math that REALLY makes investing hard. If you have a day where you lose 5% (in your case BTC drops 5%) and the next day BTC goes UP 5%, you'd think your back to even but it's actually still a quarter of a percent less than where you started 2 days prior. For movements larger than 5%, the effect keeps getting bigger. That little nuance eats people alive long-term.
But hey, I'm a HODLer and I wish for the same things you do, so best of luck and HODL on.

If you prefer dead-simple-with-extra-fees they just came out with Phoenix wallet.

I'd be curious if the privacy debate would be less focused on specific technical approaches to solutions like the block size debate was, but rather more focused on principles or affects outside of the code. For example I imagine the biggest argument people would have against privacy would be the fear of what governments would force upon exchanges and other institutions. Bitcoin doesn't care what they do but it would make things more difficult for users. I don't follow Lightcoin anymore but it'll be interesting to see how it plays out over there.

I just realized I misspoke. Technically, both Eclair Mobile and Phoenix ARE nodes, just not routing nodes. They both need to open at least one payment channel to a routing node in order to make lightning transactions. Phoenix doesn't let you pick the routing node (it's their own ACINQ node) but Eclair mobile let's you open channels with whoever you like.

Capital gains on mining income that you already paid income tax on at a defined cost basis? Makes sense, but record keeping is very difficult.
Capital gains on everyday purchases all day every day? GTFO. It's severely hindering adoption, in my opinion.

there are some trade-offs that they go into a little bit more detail farther down in the thread, but most importantly it is fully non-custodial. I currently run an Eclair full node from ACINQ and use their regular Eclair Mobile wallet, but ACINQ developers have confirmed that the more advanced users would probably still prefer their eclair wallet to the Phoenix wallet. I definitely think we need Phoenix wallet though (or any other more user-friendly wallets) for everyone else.

There are cooperative closes, but you can also "force close" a channel when a peer is uncooperative or even offline. It still works, and you still get your share of the money, but it's typically tied up for a predetermined amount of time set by both peers when they opened the channel in the first place. That's to give the peer time to react in case you're doing something malicious. The on-chain miner fee also tends to be higher when it's a force close.

All of these are good advice, but one more option is to simply get lucky finding a nice guy to throw a payment channel your way that THEY funded, so you can receive through that while spending through yours. (Initially anyway. After use all channels will start to have funds on both sides as money moves around and at that point they'll all be eligible to move either direction.)

Why don't I just listen to podcasts, you say? Very generally speaking I find YouTubers to be of a higher caliber in terms of content than podcasts. I occasionally listen to "What Bitcoin Did" with Peter Mccormack, but the vast majority of crypto podcasts that I've seen are either amateurs trying to cash in on crypto boom, or they're exclusively interviews. I'm not interested in interviews; I want the host to actually provide some content - that's why I'm subscribing to the host, to hear THEIR thoughts, not to let them sit back and let others speak while they make revenue.

Multipath payments just got released (literally this week for one implementation; the other two either already did, or will with the upcoming release.) The larger payment size immediately became a non-issue, since it can break itself up and follow multiple paths to destination. I'm actually in the process of closing down my few larger channels and reopening many smaller ones because in light of this change I think having more direct paths would be more useful to the network than capacity.
That being said, the bitcoin mempool is empty and has been reliably clearing out for the entire bear market of 2018/2019 and so I personally go on-chain at 1sat/byte for anything over 20 bucks just for the "warm and fuzzies".

In order for a patent to be granted, the solution can't be trivial and obvious to people in the field (non-layperson). I fail to see what is novel about this when every exchange that operates on an internal database tied to usernames/emails could certainly play "the middle man"; orchestrating a real on-chain tx on behalf of a layperson by simply searching their database for the user and tying them to a real BTC address.

I absolutely do not use BTC for payments because of the asinine expectations on IRS reporting. They think you buy 1 BTC in January and sell 1 BTC later like you do with stocks. Good luck mining or earning BTC in small increments gradually over time and then spending it in small increments gradually over time. Doable to pay income tax, but absolutely impossible to track capital gains, FIFO or otherwise.

If you ever want to send some BTC yourself it's a good chart to reference so you know how much fees to use. Each time the chart takes a sharp dip, that's a block being found by miners and all those topmost transactions got cleared out of the backlog and put into that block. The colored layers each represent a particular fee, with 1sat/byte being the bottom one which is always the last to clear out.
If you don’t care THAT much, nearly all wallets make a best guess estimate as a reasonable fee based on that data. Sometimes people like to customize it, or force it to 1 sat/byte if they really don’t care how long it takes. I personally have been using 1 sat/byte exclusively since roughly the $20,000 bubble pop of January 2018, but admittedly I did recently get caught with a stuck transaction that took nearly 2 weeks to finally clear.

Yep. Also will come into play as a metering unit not just from a large number of transactions, but from "streaming money" if that ever becomes a thing.

Per the link i\_gotta\_say posted in the comments, it'll clear whenever that graph taps the bottom. Last time it did that was last night (okay the innuendoes are piling up here, but I'll continue).
Based on typical historical mempool patterns I'd guess that it will clear approx 5 to 10 hours from now, when US business hours are closed and activity is usually minimal.
EDIT: Not to shill, but this morning I sent 0.0125 BTC using the Lightning network and it cleared fully in 5 seconds, and that was on mobile with questionable coverage. I spent zero in fees, but admittedly I was using my own node. (I charge less than a satoshi typically, and so it would have been as cheap as the OP's transaction but cleared in seconds.)

Fun fact: the act of talking advantage of the discrepancy in price between different exchanges is called arbitrage, and the very act of this arbitrage is what keeps the prices from diverging too much. The closer the prices converge to a good agree value worldwide, the less it's worth the effort to attempt arbitrage. Conversely, if price starts getting inflated/deflated excessively somewhere, there are already tons of bots programmed to take advantage, until the price returns to normal due to their excessive trading against it's previous direction.

Based on your principles I'm assuming you're already running a full node, and you'll run a non-custodial mobile Lightning Wallet. I'm not entirely sure if setting up your own Lightning Node buys you anything in terms of sovereignty since you're still interacting with other nodes when you create your own anyway. I'd recommend it regardless just for the experience, personally.

I interpret that to mean you are literally handing the other node money, and in order to ensure that you get it back you'd have to converse with them in a chat to have a gentleman's agreement prior to opening. if you were to do that, you may as well simply agree to open 2 channels to each other instead. that way you don't have to remember anything and the protocol keeps track of it upon channel closing.

Depends on how much you paid in fees. Typically, even the cheapest transactions clear within 24 hours, but if you zoom out on that chart, you'll see that were in the middle of a spike that may last a few days before settling back down. There are ways to pay it along by paying a higher fee, but if it's not critical you could just wait it out.

Not disagreeing, but also not as simple as you make it. I've been opening Lightning Payment channels at 1sat/byte for 8 months no problem. The last one I opened happened to be the very day Veriblock shat all over our mempool. Looking at the mempool charts, I hate to admit it but I'm seeing steady, sustained growth in the mempool, not a pop that I can blame on the price hike. It's Veriblock and it's not going away. Meanwhile, my 1sat/byte stuck funding Tx can't be simply RBF because I'd need the signature of the other node operator... (Not sure if force closing a channel before the funding Tx even gets confirmed would work, or if it's even wise to attempt at this early stage of development.) If you have any ideas I'm welcome to hear them, otherwise I'm just sitting tight hoping for at least one more mempool dip.

If you wanna be technical, Lightning operates at millisatoshi which is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than a satoshi. Nothing smaller than a satoshi can settle on-chain, however, so I guess it comes down to your interpretation of "smallest fraction of a bitcoin". Cheers and happy bitcoining!

You make sense in theory, but I've been running a node for about 8 months and I bet you have as well, and I don't see any newbs hopping straight into Lightning.

@_date: 2019-04-04 13:50:34
Not entirely true. A satoshi is the smallest unit the main-chain can handle, however the premise of the lightning network is that it's a bunch of "bar-tabs" floating around until they one day get settled on the main-chain when you're done with them. You and I can send 1e-11 BTC back and forth all day long and Lightning doesn't care. I personally charge less than 1 satoshi in routing fees from my Lightning node, and most do.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:43:39
Ummm... if you're referring to "push" amount, that's money you're really spending, and so don't do that unless it's part of an actual payment. If you want to open a 0.10 BTC channel and set a 0.05 BTC push amount thinking you'll be left with a 0.05/0.05 balanced channel, you WILL have that, but you also just gave that person 0.05 BTC...

Someone made a tipping bot on Reddit that's powered by the Lightning Network. The lightning Network is a whole new rabbit hole to go down once you get deep enough into the BTC rabbit hole. ��
Without going into the details, Lightning allows you to use BTC but with nearly no transaction fee. If you care here's a screenshot of me blowing money in my Lightning wallet, and you can see the fees are so low they don't register in the display (they are less than 1e-8 BTC each)

bitusher is correct regarding what happens to that last little sub-satoshi remainder, however I'd add that after hundreds/thousands of payments on your channel and a final balance of whatever it is (say .01 BTC) I wouldn't really care what happened to that last 1e-14 BTC. The onchain fee would be orders of magnitude larger anyway (even at 1sat/byte).

I know this is a desktop implementation, but is it "meant" to be an always on, 24/7 routing node like the 3 main implementations, or is it meant to be a lightning-enabled wallet, like a mobile lightning wallet, in which you're connected to maybe one or two channels and not typically online unless you're using it?
Reason I ask: I'm already running a full Lightning node and already have a mobile lightning wallet, but if this is a full routing node I was interested in spooling up a 2nd one just to try this one (my other one is Eclair).

Not sure if my line of thinking here is correct, but this particular transaction was directly from my BTC full node. Since it IS a node, I assume it would never purge it's own transaction?
 The reason I can't do RBF is because it's a funding tx to a lightning channel, and so I'd need the other partie's signature. Half of the 1sat/byte txs cleared the mempool yesterday, and so I'm hoping today finishes it off before the work week starts again.

But who actually owns the pushed amount? i.e. If either node closed the channel and settled to the blockchain, it was my understanding that A and B actually get 0.05 BTC. If I'm wrong then I'm pissed b/c I could have balanced 95 channels upon creation lol.
Edit: Here's where I got the notion from, a while back:  [ 
@_date: 2019-04-14 13:52:23
[I run a "full" Lightning node]( on a PC using Eclair, and so I use [Eclair mobile wallet]( to complement it, but there are others. I like Eclair though, and the devs are great. There is a [testnet version of the wallet]( that you may want to play with until you get the hang of it, or just start with a little bit of money on the real one. If you need any help setting up let me know!
The general goal of using the Lightning Network for BTC payments is that the fees are practically zero and it's really fast, allowing you to do things like play games with micropayments or (in the future) even "stream" money, for example watching an ad-free video at the rate of 0.0000000001 BTC/second or whatever.
I'm not even a gamer, but I've found that games are a good way to practice using the wallet, since current games are super-cheap and you get lots of opportunities to make sub-$0.01 payments. Here's a few that I've messed with. I've also purchased a T-shirt and some other stuff using Lightning, but games are a way to blow through dozens of tiny payments right away rather than one big one to start with.
Sample games:
[Satoshi's Game of Life]( A neat online puzzle game where you pay-per-pixel and watch what happens to your "cells" that you've generated. You can make neat patterns, and it's based on [this]( 
[Penguin Shooter]( Some shooting game where you pay small amounts to upgrade weapons and generate enemies, etc. This one requires you to actually download the game and install it.
[Evil Blob Monester]( Hangman game, made by a guy and his 7 year old son. For me personally, the site wasn't behaving very well (often had to hit refresh) but it was something to try out. This one isn't as good for practice as the previous two, because you deposit an initial chunk of money (say, 200 satoshis) and then play from that "pot", which means you only actually use your wallet once or twice.

I'm running both if you need help, but I'd agree do BTC full node first, since you can add Lightning to it later if desired.
You may already know this, but you can mess with Lightning payments without any node by simply downloading a mobile lightning wallet. You would just connect it to any existing public Lightning node and they'll route the payments for you. I use [Eclair]( by ACINQ and it works great. This morning I sent 0.0125 BTC and it arrived 5 seconds later, with zero tx fee. (Admittedly the zero fee was only because I run the node the payment went through, however if this had been you, the fee would have been a satoshi or so.)
If you do get a mobile wallet, you need to connect it to someone's node to route payments for you on Lightning.
Here is [ACINQs]( and here is [MINE]( I'm well connected, but admittedly ACINQ is one of the largest nodes and I've had no issues with them.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:09:58
Do you intend on running a Lightning Node or just downloading a Lightning Mobile wallet that connects to someone else's node? (As I ask this I realize how complicated this currently is..... it'll get better.)
If you are just looking for a mobile wallet, I personally use Eclair Mobile on Android. You need to first send BTC to your mobile wallet, and then you can allocate some (or all) of it into a "channel" with a full node who would route all your payments. (Or several channels if you want to split it up.) My node is well connected with 95 channels throughout the network, although ACINQ (the company that makes Eclair) has a huge one if you'd rather.

I daytraded stocks for 10 years before I found crypto in 2017 (boy did those last 10 years feel like a waste of time ever since…!)
Kunal Desai of BullsOnWallSt said something that’s stuck with me. I’m paraphrasing, but essentially every aspect of a chart that you’re looking at (moving averages, volume patterns, candlestick patterns) are nothing more than a tiny piece of evidence as part of a “case” you are trying to build for yourself as to whether you buy or sell. It’s like you’re a lawyer trying to build a case to convince the jury (yourself) that you should buy/sell.
The best way to explain it is by showing you what this does NOT mean: Go to any random CryptoYouTuber who just learned about T.A. five minutes ago and suddenly starts spouting nonsense like “Bicoin is printing a 3 white soldiers pattern on the daily-and-a-half chart and so the best time to buy will be once it kisses this Fibonacci retracement line right here.”  DAFAQOUTTAHERE with your bullshit.
I personally live-tweeted my trades to a following of about 11 bots and maybe 2 real people back in 2016 or 2017 ( if you care to see my track record, but all I’m saying is that you will trade better to know the basics, but don’t ever think a stock/coin gives a crap about anyone’s charts.
Conversely I’ll add that at least on shorter timeframes, price doesn’t give a damn about fundamentals either. lol

Depending on how much you care, I've heard that some mobile wallets are full custodial, not custodial, and everything in between.
I've only used Eclair as a Lightning wallet, and it's connected to my own full node that I run on a dedicated PC. I've also heard of BlueWallet for iOS and Android but I'm not sure where on the spectrum it falls.

Well to take it a step further, when BTC pops nearly all crypto pops, fork or otherwise. The day we got the initial pop a few days ago, the top 100 on CMC were all up big except literally 2 entries. (Even Tether was 1.01 lol)

probably through some API command or something, but I'm not familiar with linux. Based on my own interactions within the community I feel like Windows nodes are in the minority and most of the folks here are either using a Linux computer or a RasPi, CASA node, etc so I'm sure you can find someone knowledgeable on r/lightningnetwork
For what it's worth, you are correct that nothing can happen if you only have 1 channel. If you wanted to earn money by routing payments among other nodes, you need at least a 2nd one, so that you can be the "hop" in the payment. If you do this you'll see one of your channels gain money and the other lose money. They should balance out, except for any fee you collect over the top.

In full disclosure, I pair my mobile wallet to my own lightning node and so no fees. However, here is a screenshot of my node and example fees I've collected from routing payments of others. Note that lightning runs on 11 decimal places (millisat), not 8 (satoshis)!

Using me as an example (my node is [platform9and3quarters]( I currently have nearly 100 open channels. I am an honest person and if I somehow managed to acquire money that belonged to you, I’d give it back even if I didn’t have to. The catch is, I’d never notice because I don’t have a practical way to monitor my activity across so many channels. If you opened a new channel to me today and pushed half of it to my node, I wouldn’t even notice that I have a new channel, let alone that the channel gave me free money. If a few months later you have a hardware failure or extended power outage and the channel gets forced closed automatically by the network for some reason, the channel would settle on the main chain, giving me whatever you pushed me (assuming the balance hasn’t been scattered across all of my other channels by that point, due to day-to-day routing activity across the network.)
So all I was saying is that if we instead opened up 2 channels and each one was funded fully by the person who created it, the Lightning Network would handle the ownership of the money and neither of us would have to even be paying attention. (All this being said, I think c-lightning does not support 2 channels between the same nodes and so this method wouldn't work for anyone running c-lightning. I personally use Eclair.)

This isn't even about BCH, honestly. Based on what you are saying your friend knows something about X and you don't know anything about X from a source other than your friend. Therefore you should certainly not invest in X unless of course you start doing some independent research of your own, since it's your money.
All that being said here's my 2 cents. BCH already struggling in market cap against BTC. Splitting into 2 will only make it that much harder to catch up. Bitmain isn't doing too well based on financials that were released as part of IPO filing, and they may have paid a large part in keeping BCH afloat thus far. All that paints a pretty bleak picture long term.

I'm fully in camp BTC, I can't stand Bcashers, although you sound exactly like one except for your ideals. RBF doesn't work because the payment in question is a funding tx for my 95th payment channel on the lightning network, which requires the signature of the other party. But you already knew all that because you Bitcoin. F*** off.

I run eclair on win 10 so I'm not sure what your readouts look like, but is it possible that the amount displayed is without the reserved amount? I think lightning does says to reserve some estimated amount for channel closing fees. Done the main chain mempool spiked to hell, perhaps it's dedicating more funds for that? If so, it would come back if the mempool ever comes back under control.

Depends what you mean by "do". DOGEcoin is frikkin fast as hell and works great. But if the entire cryptoverse actually migrated over to it it would grind to a halt. IOTAs "tangle" seemed like an amazing and totally new direction that didn't have any of the downsides of a blockchain, but after 10 minutes of DD I discovered huge vulnerabilities in it that just made it one more coin that moved the sliders around between security/decentralization/speed. THe nice thing about crypto is that you don't have to pick one, so if you really want speed and security but think this whole decentralization stuff is anti-government fear mongering, there are certainly plenty of altcoins that'll work just fine with those sacrifices. For me, as complex as BTC's approach seems, if they pull it off they really are going to manage to get a pretty high score on all 3 which is an insanely difficult achievement.

That would suck. I've had similar sudden spikes at "just the wrong time" cause issues with lightning payment channels because the 2 parties had too large of a discrepancy between their estimated current on-chain fees.

The argument should be irrelevant. Saying it's a store of value by design is really saying "I'm sorry it can't scale". The lightning Network is showing great promise and so can we all stop pretending we need to make a choice, and admit that the ideal goal is for BTC to be BOTH a store of value and digital cash. If it is only one and not the other it hasn't lived up to its true potential and was only a partial success. If it can scale, it can be both and there's no sensible reason for it not to be.

In fairness to BTC, the vast majority of the near-instant altcoins only work that way because in a relative sense nobody is using them. Any blockchain based coin would hit the same scalability issues BTC did.
 If you want to mess with early stage experimental stuff (not that Bitcoin isn't...) grab a lightning wallet. I'm running a node [Platform9and3quarters] and have near-zero fees, just like every other node operator right now. The transactions are so fast I often can't catch the routing going through from my mobile wallet through my node to the merchants. I bought a Tshirt online and paid exactly 1satoshi in fees, and it was instant. (I will admit that Lightning is still not user friendly and it's very new, but anyone playing with crypto is already smart enough to figure this stuff out.)

I didn't come onto the scene until 2017 and so I can only speculate, but is it fair to say that a lot of those altruistic projects came about because people in the space became genuinely wealthy? Once a person is freed from day-to-day responsibilities they may take a moment to find a “real” purpose in life and look for ways to contribute to society.
Newer bitcoiners say they “want Lambo” but it’s just a front – what they’re really saying is that they have responsibilities that bind them to a day-job, and they wish to be rid of that so they can do what they want. Some people would make good use of their newfound free time, some won’t.
Although I came in “late” I find the early days fascinating. I see what you’re saying about the difference in the community because it shows in early writings/podcasts. I don’t even know who Amir is, but I’ll search. If you have any gems of his that you’d like to share I’d love a few links! :-)

Not sure what you mean - A way of working out the cost basis?
As it currently stands, I receive income from mining which is subject to income tax. If I then HODL and sell later that's capital gains, but I seriously don't see a way to properly track that longterm if you use it as everyday currency. Even if the IRS has the means, the people also need to have the means in order to report it. Everytime I ask a tax adviser, the home-spreadsheet-based answers are clearly assuming you bought 10 whole BTC for one price 5 years ago and are buying a single car with it today, and it's trivial to figure out the capital gains.  I'm talking about a world where both the income and the expenditure of BTC are on a rolling, continual basis of very small amounts all day every day, spanning across years.
@_date: 2019-09-20 13:07:13
You gotta admit though - it's kind of nice being stuck around 10k if you're trying to actually use BTC in the "real world" as actual payments b/c you can convert back and forth as needed very quickly in your head. Don't get me wrong - I'd much rather be saying the same thing at 100k or a million ;-)

I don't know why people don't like Coinbase, it's dead simple for a beginner and as secure as any 3rd party's going to be, but bear in mind its always MOST secure to store BTC yourself offline. For $10, don't worry about that. Simply having .0015 BTC will be enough to keep you interested and you'll learn more and more. After that, put more in if you want and learn how to store it better. But to start, I say you can't beat Coinbase. Its fees are much worse than other places, but again you're paying for simplicity and convenience and as a beginner those things are worth something.

I built one PC out of garbage parts that they were recycling at work. They were more than 12 years old and weren't even worth keeping around as spares. The CPU is a dual-core. Runs a full/indexed/archival/listening BTC node with open port, and a Lightning Network node that's transmitted thousands of payments. It's running right now, and here's the resource usage: [
This is a full-size PC and I think it pulls around 130W at the wall. If that's too much, many people on here are running RasPi's that can get far less power draw. I run it "headless" and control it via a remote desktop app on my phone, and so I'm not paying to power a monitor.
EDIT: I should add that the RAM usage is configurable - I have it set to cap the mempool at 1GB, and the cache at 3GB plus anything unused from the 1GB mempool (so 4GB total). This isn't necessary, but I do it to minimize disk activity and speed up syncing.

You mean the un-backed-up LPU channel can't route payments? Have you tried force-closing it?
Reason I ask is b/c I can send a payment to myself that routes through you two. Everyone keeps the same amount of total money in their node, but I'd essentially be draining your channel, from your side to their side. Obviously the amount of money moving from your side to LPU's side would be compensated with equal amounts within your other channels so that the total amount in your node that belongs to you is constant. (Just like routing any other LN payment.)
If this doesn't make sense it probably sounds scammy as hell, lol. But if it DOES make sense and you think it would work I'm all for trying just let me know.

What you're describing very often leads to "resonance" whereby far too many miners hop on the bandwagon once it's profitable again, setting up for a fresh punch in the face 2016 blocks later when hashrate had severely overshot.
I've seen it on countless low-nethash sh\*tcoins in 2018 that dealt with a similar thing due to NiceHash's auto-profit switching. You quickly hit the delta-diff cap (4X up or 1/4 down from previous) and you stay there indefinitely, or until manual intervention with a more refined diff adjustment algorithm.

I can at least throw a wrench in the whole thing by saying that crypto market cap is nearly meaningless as a metric since the vast majority of coins are held long term (i.e. not liquid)
The old argument is that if you have some garbage unheard of altcoin that's minted millions of coins and is essentially worthless, but one guy (the developer, likely...) creates 2 accounts on an exchange and wash trades with himself over a dozen coins for $10 each, the "technical" calculation for the market cap of the coin would be ten dollars times the millions of coins in circulation, and so the final number would be complete nonsense.
A lot of people claim the "real" BTC dominance on places like coinmarketcap would be much closer to 100% the more you try and factor out the nonsense, but in reality you're walking a fine line between refining an analysis vs massaging data to fit a narrative.

While I don’t sympathize with “Moron pays \[insane amount\] to get \[bullshit career\]” I think the real issue is that easy access to big loans backed by gov caused universities to see $$$$$ and so they just cranked up tuition like crazy, knowing everyone will just take the loans (higher price without fear of fewer customers.) But if the gov didn't offer any kind of help and we all expected kids to go to work first and THEN go get an education when they could afford it, that's also stupid because opportunity costs are a thing.

FWIW I'm running a dedicated spare PC with 2 large HDDs and 8GB RAM. It's only purpose is to hold QT wallets for sh\*tcoins that don't have hardware wallet support. Does messing with a BTC node (and or LN node) on the same PC as these altcoins (different HDD) reduce the security of my other QT wallets? They are encrypted obviously, but if supporting the network sacrifices the security of other cryptos (aside from the BTC LN collateral of course) then I don't see the benefit of pursuing this.

I watched $20k live on GDAX at the time in 2017, and can attest that GDAX/CoinBase servers were constantly down during price swings. From what I've heard, major crypto exchanges in general are far more robust now, given how much frikkin money they made during that spike.

Yeah, I'm aware of FIFO, but it made a lot more sense when I was trading stocks. You pick up 100 shares of something all at once, pick up 100 more a month later, sell 100 a month later, and you put that against the first 100 that you've kept straight on a simple spreadsheet. Easy peasy.
Now, you make .00001 BTC every hour of every day (made up number) and buy a $3 coffee at 9am 2 years later, then get some gas for your car 30 minutes after that.... it won't take long for you to have no idea where in your long string of micro-incomes you're currently sitting, even if you DID manage to have a cost basis for all those old transactions.

your 150 year comment - I thought I remembered the length of those "epochs" or whatever you wanna call them to be about that length. Obviously previous epochs don't necessarily mean anything to future ones, but it was worth noting that they were all similar in duration and our bar is about at the typical stopping point, maybe another 50 years if you're shooting for the high end of the average.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:20:38
I completely agree with you - the largest hurdle for adoption as an actual currency is capital gains on purchases. I accumulate BTC gradually via mining; I have none that I've purchased at all and so there is no massive chunk of BTC at a known cost basis - it's just a running mess of varying USD values for every satoshi.
I HODL and so it hasn't been an issue yet, but if I start actually using 3 year old BTC to buy everyday crap on a continual basis, HOW THE F am I supposed to figure out my cost basis on all of it? 
Sure, I have a self-recorded cost basis on my mining for the purpose of income tax, but once you start spending some of it, no level of record keeping is going to be able to keep track of which specific satoshis, with a specific cost basis, are being spent.

I run a Lightning Network node and as far as I know BTC users have kind of accepted that it's not going to work shoving everyone's morning coffee's onto the public blockchain where it's recorded and tracked forever.
I'm first to admit that Lightning is complicated and appears convoluted to all hell to the novice, but so was email at the onset. It "technically" works right now and I use it, and [my fees are typically 200 millisats]( (that's LESS than 1 satoshi total for the transaction) but once the main functionality is nailed down, someone really needs to make it user friendly.

@_date: 2019-09-09 19:09:32
I'd be happy to try, but the only catch would be that you'd probably have to close the other LPU channel first. Reason being that while I can explicitly define a payment route, I can only go by node ID's not channel ID's. So if I send a payment and force it to go from you to LPU, I can't guarantee that it wouldn't pick the other channel.
If you know the "good" channel can't be used for the transaction because it doesn't have enough funds in the "you--&gt;LPU" direction, then you could leave it alone I assume.
If you want me to try anyway just let me know how large you want the payment to be (whatever's on your side of the stuck LPU channel). Only total channel capacities are public, and so I can't see what amounts are on what side.

Mostly yes, but one bonus for yourself it's that if you have a lightning compatible wallet and are also running a LN node, you can link the wallet to your own node with zero fees. Depending on how well connected your node is, you should be paying near zero fees for any lightning purchase then. I'm "platform9and3quarters" if you ever run a node and want a cheap connection!

Well I don't feel right elaborating on here because as a member of "team BTC" I don't want to spread FUD if there are in fact no concerns to be had, but as one example I'm a Lightning Network node operator (platform9and3quarters) and a few weeks ago some FUD came out about how, in the future once onchain fees are much higher (which they will be, let's admit as much) there could be [this issue]( If it's FUD then it's FUD and should be dealt with swiftly, but I never did hear a "real" rebuttal to this. The closest I've heard is someone commenting that "segwit fixes this problem" which it may, but I have no idea how because nobody really elaborated.
I'd even be happy with a response like "It really is an issue but we're pretty confident that there's a fix we just don't care right now b/c it's a theoretical issue that won't happen for years and we're busy."
This is totally unrelated but I'll throw in a funny observation I had: The "fork" crew love to tout how their chain is running smoothly with near zero fees, but if you look at THEIR mempool, blocks are consistently under 1MB simply due to lack of adoption. So the really funny thing is, if THEY had a 1MB blocksize cap they'd still run fine simply because nobody's using it. I feel like that takes a lot of wind out of the sails of their "See? It's working!" argument.

Nice idea but it honestly would only work if you never spent your bitcoins. As you begin to spend your bitcoins, the money has to come from somewhere and if you equally take it out of your short and long positions, because your Fiat value of the short and long positions changes as the underlying price of Bitcoin changes, your position becomes more heavily weighted to the long or the short side.

My "dedicated PC" is quite literally a PC that was built exclusively using parts that were slated for recycling at work, which means that they had already been re-purposed as spare parts and got to the point where they weren't even worth being spares.

Absolutely right; I missed that very important point! I tend to match people with a return channel, because eclair doesn't yet let you explicitly define your route, so you can't pay yourself and forcefully rebalance any single channel.

@_date: 2019-05-23 13:07:41
If Bitcoin actually gains real adoption the different between 1mb and 8mb would be negligible. "Spammy" type transactions such as Veriblock will simply fill up the space anyway, and if there is still more space to spare, then Veriblock will see more competitors crop up. Just one example but my point is we need something more than just blocksize.
As far as testing 8mb and bigger, it's only testing in the sense that a few large blocks went through and then usage collapsed again. Unless those blocks were 8mb nonstop for the past decade, the test didn't cover all failure modes because that's what it would look like in real world adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:59:46
Yes, even without deliberate spam attacks, projects like Veriblock will spring up as long it's affordable to do so. As a decentralized system, not much we can do about it but let the fee market dis-incentivise "junk".

I am a residential guy running a dedicated PC in my house through a cable company (ISP). My PC has a full archival/listening BTC Core node, and Eclair's Lightning Node. I do have the Bitcoin Node capped at 5GB daily to avoid irritating the ISP, but the Lightning Node isn't data-intensive like the blockchain is. From what I understand you don't even need a full BTC node anymore to run this, but since it's a dedicated PC I just do it all.
I rarely use it honestly (I'm a HODLer) but I did pair my mobile Eclair wallet to my own full Eclair Lightning node just so that it's there to make nearly-free payments if I want to mess around online. I also collect some fees for running it (see below).
In answer to your question about facilitating the LN, a full node can route payments for everyone else as long as you have at least 2 payment channels open. I have about 100 channels and according to stats my node is directly connecting about 2% of the entire lightning network! The incentive for you is that you get to charge a fee off the top for transmitting people's funds. While "fees" sound bad for the users, bear in mind that the Lightning Network has to operate nearly free in order to make sense, otherwise people would just use the regular blockchain and its fees. I don't actually make "useful" money but that may change if the blockchain's mempool explodes 2017-style.
I personally charge 1 millionth of a satoshi per satoshi routed (this comes out to  0.0001% fee) The network average seems to be between that and upwards of 0.01%
Hope this helps!

I'm not, that's why I hold BTC and sold my fork for more BTC the moment I could. But I don't want to blindly parrot each other in our safe space either. I want healthy checks and balances (but not the copy/paste parroted arguments from the other side, either.)
@_date: 2019-05-20 02:32:55
I'm not aware of significant interest accounts for BTC. You could use it in the lightning Network routing other people's payments and collecting a free, however then you have all your crypto out of your cold storage which isn't really worth the passive income you'd get. I run a lightning Network node, and I can say that rates are pretty much zero right now.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:48:23
Based on my limited understanding there were technical hurdles given the way the channels are set up, but it'll come for sure. I'm most excited about atomic multipath payments so we can stop splitting our balance 100 ways and killing our purchasing capacity. That, and spicing which will allow "topping off" channels rather than making new ones all the time.

That's true - onboarding would be a nightmare.

@_date: 2018-12-31 01:29:20
I'm actually butchering it, I knew when I was writing it, lol. I wish I could remember the specifics, but I used to daytrade stocks for 10 years before crypto. There is an index, VIX, that tracks something (the specifics don't matter here) and then there are 2 other funds that you can invest in. One is called UVXY which simply tracks the VIX, but triple-leveraged. Another is called SVXY, which is the same thing, except short the VIX instead of long. They are essentially opposites.
Now here's where my "brilliant idea" came in.... Since both UVXY and SVXY use triple leverage, they both suffer from fees associated with the leverage. They both lose X% daily to these fees. So... If 50% of your portfolio is shorting UVXY and the other 50% shorting SVXY, then no matter what VIX does, UVXY and SVXY will cancel out, EXCEPT the fees, which will both work in your favor, hence you just collect money every day. So I tried this strategy (in a dummy account first, thankfully) and it turns out there is a catch which not only ruined my plan, but I think it would affect yours in the same manner.
Okay so... Half your money is short UVXY and half is short SVXY on day 1. After day 1, VIX either went up or down, which means if UVXY went up, SVXY went down (or visa versa). Here's the catch: Now on day 2 you are no longer 50/50. One of your two positions is a larger % of your portfolio, which means you now actually do have a preference/bias on the direction of VIX tomorrow. Now you're essentially just long or short VIX "a little bit", but it compounds.
To avoid this and stay neutral and balanced, you need to move some of your funds from UVXY to SVXY or visa versa. If you keep doing this every day, you'll find that you'll just slowly run out of money because each day you take a little bit of a hit. I'm not 100% sure but I feel like your strategy would also become more having weighted towards either long or short BTC after a few days and then it'll come off the rails in the same manner. I'd actually be interested to see what would happen if you try it on paper for a month first and see what happens.
Hmm... This is even worse than my first post.

Obviously nobody can know, but FWIW my personal opinion of all of this is that we are all severely underestimating just how many coins OGs can have, and that BTC is still suffering from massive sells by CW to attack BCHABC123XYZ (and maybe Roger's crew as well in order to defend.) "The flippening" just happened between those 2 camps which I don't think anyone saw coming, and so that "war" is far from over.
If I had spare money to throw at it, I would average into more and more BTC the whole way down, because CW has to run out of money someday. Make no mistake, however, this isn't the stock market - CW very well may have WAAAAAAAAY more BTC than we realize.

Yep, according to [ the mempool is running away on me - it'll probably confirm in a few hours when the daily logjam clears. I don't set a hard limit on fees but rather aim for inclusion within about 50 blocks (roughly 8 hours) in bitcoinconfig. For 2018 it's yielded about 1 sat/byte anyway.

I have a smart outlet for my mining rig that reads power draw. Hooking it up to the "node" PC read something like 130W (I forget exact number) which was probably not much more than idle, although I didn't think to check it at true idle with BTC Core and Eclair closed for a baseline.
That's certainly not free, but my mining rig pulls a kW so it's not the biggest problem. ;-) Unlike mining, running these nodes doesn't work your PC very hard and so you don't have to use a dedicated PC if you're already using one (but you'd want to run it 24/7) so in that case there really isn't any overhead.

Only thing I'd say is that, at least for now, creating a channel is still an on-chain fee to get started, and the mempool could explode in another 2017 bull run any moment. I have around 100 channels (which is overkill) and I spent 1 sat/byte funding all of em, even if it took days to clear. Multiplied over 100 payments, even the current 150 sat/byte fee estimate would have been quite expensive and I wouldn't have made so many.
On the flipside, if you wait long enough, there will be things like "channel factories" that would allow groups of people to split the cost of onboarding making this whole argument negligible, but you'd have to wait for that to be implemented.

There's this thing called "average intelligence" in which I am aware of the blockchain but would have no idea how to extract that specific info. Block explorers aren't exactly Google Analytics...
 If I had to do it myself I guess I would start by browsing the blockchain and noting the payout address of each mining reward, but surely someone out there has already done this with a script and made a pretty little chart for simple people, much like all the sites be that display the current state of the mempool.

The number wasn't meant to be literal, I just mean generally speaking I do fully believe BCH was up to no good and there seems to be plenty of evidence out there to suggest that, but I'm merely saying that if everyone could simply blame December on some BCH spam attack, then everything would be hunky-dory now and there'd be no reason to even work on the Lightning Network (of which I'm running a node myself as well as a full BTC node so it's not like I'm not full-on team BTC here...)
There is a difference between concern trolling and not being naive. I'm doing everything I can to help scaleability in my own way since I can't code, because I know as soon as mainstream media starts going gaga over BTC again we'll be right back at $50 fees until LN is more fully integrated into newbie's typical onramps (like Coinbase, Binance, Electrum, etc).

I am running both nodes 24/7 although I'll admit, the computer is built from a bunch of scrap parts that were being recycled at work so it's a dedicated machine that I don't have to ever use for anything else. all of the PC components are old junk that is not high performance, the only thing that you will need is a huge hard drive the blockchain is currently around 200 gigabytes.
Edit: I did just think of one thing that you may have to pay attention to. If you're only running the node for yourself then nothing to worry about, but if you open up the port so that others can synchronize from you, you may want to put a cap on the amount of data that you can upload because some internet service providers don't like you running several hundred gigabytes a month. I can show you how to set up the configuration file if you'd like that; I currently have mine capped at 5 gigabytes a day.

I only have minimal experience with autopilot when I tried LND, but it seems like unless you have a huge balance all it does is throw 95% or more of your money into a single channel with a decent peer. Regardless of what your current channel situation is, you could open a new one with additional funds if you have more sitting in your wallet.
If you want to take the newly acquired money and make some of your existing channels larger, that can’t be done yet but splicing would indeed help with that. Essentially all you’d be doing is closing the channel and opening a larger replacement one, all in the same on-chain transaction.
There are supposedly 3rd party websites in which you send them on-chain BTC and they top off your lightning channels, but they can only top-off, not make larger. Also, neither of the ones I’m familiar with have worked for me at all ( [ and [ ). I’m actually at the point where I’d rather be filling existing channels than creating new ones, and so by all means let me know if you find a way to do that…
If you care, my personal approach has been to take all mining income for the week and create a new channel to a new peer with it on Fridays (between .005 BTC and .010 BTC). The mempool is usually empty on weekends anyway, and so even a 1sat/byte funding transaction usually leaves me with another channel ready to go by the time I get into the office on Monday.
Hope this helps!

@_date: 2019-05-16 13:51:45
This got wordy - my apologies...
The balance among all your channels is a zero sum game (assuming you’re not buying or selling anything yourself, of course). So let’s say you open a single channel to me and I open one back to you (doesn’t have to be the same person). Now you have 1 channel with all the money on your side, and one channel with all the money on the peer’s side. Now you can route payments, but only in 1 direction. As money starts to flow that direction, you now have 2 channels with money on both sides. Now you can route payments either way, and all else being equal you can sit back and watch funds flow back and forth, while the TOTAL balance on your side among all of your channels always remains the same except for microfees that you may collect based on what you set.
Here’s a snapshot of the state of all my channels – [
You can see that funds wander around between both sides, and for a given payment size (bottom chart x-axis) my node has a certain number of channels with adequate capacity on my side, and a certain number of channels with adequate capacity on the peer’s side. For a payment to be routed successfully by me, I need at least 1 channel in each direction with enough capacity, which is why you can see the # of available channels trail off as the payments get larger. For a large 0.1 BTC payment, I only have 1 channel with enough funds on my side, and several with enough on the other side. In this snapshot, I’d be unable to route a payment above 0.09 BTC because at that point I no longer have a channel with enough funds on my side, despite several with enough on the remote side. Most Lightning payments are well under 1000 satoshi, and so I have over 50 channels in both directions to find an optimal route, in most cases.
All that being said, a future improvement to the network will be “splicing”, which will allow you to top off your channels if you want to add more funds to your node. You can currently do that with 3rd party services, but they charge about 3% to do it. Essentially you pay them an on-chain amount, and then they pay your lightning node through the network. It’s a nice stop-gap for now, but it does incur the fee, and isn’t trustless since they don’t “have” to pay your lightning invoice. I actually did this with a redditor for free going completely on a gentleman’s agreement, but that’s certainly not advised. ;-)

@_date: 2019-05-17 13:27:33
Best way I can explain it is that since the network is just a collection of nodes connecting to each other, you will certainly have a few big players who can afford to become huge "hubs" and there are many like that, including ACINQ and rompert, however the key point is that YOUR node can route however it wants. The very second a big hub tries to creep up fees, censor, or otherwise do something we don't like, we're all instantly routing around them and they lose all traffic. It's self-regulating in that regard.

Happens to everyone all the time unfortunately. In my opinion, the level of misinformation needed to consider it a Ponzi scheme in the first place almost means that the argument is too far gone to bother, unless it's your spouse or parent that you are going to have to live with!
Firstly the very definition of a Ponzi scheme requires there to be an actual person enticing suckers, to run off with their money. Even the most basic understanding of Bitcoin would show that no matter who originally programmed it, there is nobody running off with anybody's money at this point; it just can't at the protocol level. Sure, it very well could be a fad and some day collapse in value if people lose interest and don't find utility in it, but that is a completely different thing from a Ponzi scheme or any scam for that matter.

As an Eclair node operator I'm feeling a little bit of neglect here...

Very nice! Bookmarking this and I'll definitely give it a go.

Admittedly I haven't tried, but I run my own full node and would love to run a site like his but with my own node's mempool. Does the code handle "site hosting"? i.e. if I did clone it and reconfigure it, do I need a website or is this a sort of page that is served up directly from the PC my node resides on?

FWIW, I upgraded both BTC Core and Eclair node today. If you'd still want to connect I'd be curious if that fixed the issue.

Yep - you're connected and it appears working (status NORMAL). I've opened a channel back, but "daily rush hour on the Bitcoin mempool" is already 30 minutes underway and so my funding Tx may not confirm for a while b/c I'm a cheap bastard with fees.

You don't lose money until you sell back into dollars. Keep stackin' sats!

Well in fairness, we are getting a little giddy saying something "doubled" while ignoring the long bear market that got us here...

Nah, whatever you want! If you want to return channel to match it let me know!

This article is garbage. I don't even mean "I disagree with it's viewpoint, so I'm going to say it's garbage."
I mean, it is garbage. There is absolutely no substance to the article whatsoever, and in no way warrants sharing it reposting here unless you yourself wrote it, in which case you should be ashamed. Not because of your viewpoint, but because there is seriously no effort in this piece.
You don't owe me a thing. But if you did, it would be any shred of reasoning as to why you feel the way you apparently do regarding the future of Bitcoin. If you have no such thing, then might I suggest you go cover the legacy financial system while we work on something new.
I'm fairly certain my word count in this Reddit comment has already surpassed the word count of the aforementioned article.

Don't remember.... was it an lntip? If so, you don't "really" have a Lightning node because the LNtipbot's node is holding it for you.
(Incidentally, I'm connected to him too - our channel ID is:  553582x696x0 ) haha

Based on my wiki-ing, Australia is a country and continent, but as a continent it can also be called Sahul, Australinea, or Meganesia to avoid confusion. Oceania is a region that encompasses the continent as well as a few more places. So the country Australia is a subset of the continent Australia which is a subset of the region of Oceana. Assuming my single wiki page source is accurate anyway.....

If you WERE Bill Gates, you'd say stuff like this to throw us off.

This is simultaneously a great idea and a terrible one. I very much fear that the SEC and FED can and will screw up BTC through fractional reserve nonsense. An annual Proof of Keys is a great way to keep all custodians honest.
The downside is that BTC flat-out can't scale on main chain. Let's not pretend that it didn't fail miserably in Dec of 2017, and that volume was NOTHING compared to what could potentially happen if Proof of Keys gains any traction whatsoever. As far as I can understand, Lightning Network or side chains wouldn't really help with the spirit of Proof Of Keys either. Nobody's going to pay $50 both ways to "stick it to the man", and if you force a 2sat/byte Tx fee you may get away with that in 2019 if you can wait 2 weeks, but that won’t fly in the future with broader adoption.
Why the hell can’t crypto be easy??!?!?!!  ;-)
