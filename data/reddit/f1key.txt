They try to fool people into believing they are bitcoin and not just an alt coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:38:05
LOL guys you’re going to be waiting for the rest of your lives for 2,000 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:36:42
LOL dude you’re never getting in
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:24:27
No definitely not. Maybe saying I love bitcoin was the wrong way to express what I actually love. More than bitcoin, I love decentralized currencies. I love the positive change they can bring to this world.
I wouldn’t mind throwing my credit and debit cards into the fire though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:48:11
Dude lost his mind
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:26:19
Easily will see 100k. The misunderstanding a lot of outsiders have is that you have to buy 1 bitcoin at a time. You don’t. 1 “bitcoin” is a just a unit of Bitcoin.  1 bitcoin is equal to 100,000,000 satoshis. Nobody is going to be buying whole bitcoins at $100k they’ll just be changing dollars into satoshis.
Don’t get hung up on the price of the bitcoin unit as much as the market cap.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:08:00
Sure there will be drawdowns but I don’t think they’ll last long or be super dramatic unless something unforeseen happens like a governmental ban. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:28:13
You’re pretty negative toward bitcoin. I’m guessing you’re heavy into alts with little or no bitcoin based on your tone.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:59:20
We seriously Must NOT tolerate censorship 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:22:52
You’re still making exactly the same mistake. Next December you’ll be posting that you wish you bought some Satoshis at $9,000.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:15:46
You’re buying satoshis. Bitcoin fractions. Don’t get hung up on the price of a “Bitcoin” unit
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:00:50
I actually think we are still quite off from that because of the sheer volume of newcomers. Maybe in 1-2 years once the crazy rush slows up
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:43:28
If bitcoin remained at $10,000 forever I would still love it and I’m sure there are plenty of others like me. I love what it represents. Decentralized currencies are amazing. And as far as speed and fees - improvement is needed but I have total confidence that it’ll get there and faster than people realize. There probably will be a bubble burst someday. I just don’t think we are even close to that. Maybe at $500,000/BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:53:01
Do what you want
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:46:46
Exactly this! Hell, this is the case with most ICO’s. Greedy people who saw Bitcoins success and think they can get in early on the next bitcoin

The value of particular crypto depends on the demand so I like to spread the love to speak. More important than buying things with crypto is giving small amounts away to friends and family so that they are on the train with you and not completely left behind. It also causes crypto to spread virally.

Why nano over trezor? I'm in the market for a hardware wallet and trying to decide which to purchase

Lol well yea the fork event is how you can distinguish the fork

Name a better place to invest $450 haha
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:47:03
Actually you're wrong. There is an ETF and you can buy it from your IRA. Its been trading way over the NAV though so I wouldn't recommend it.
You clearly believe in Bitcoin but I recommend you temper your mania. It may be worth pennies in a few years for all we know. Again, I'm long on bitcoin and don't feel like that's what will happen but if it does I wouldn't be shocked either. I am diversified enough that if Bitcoin went to pennies I'd be fine.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:27:53
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:35:18
That’s what’s happening? Can you please provide me a source on this? I want to be better informed
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:30:36
I actually really like litecoin but I think bitcoin is still safer due to its enormous market cap and worldwide recognition. Maybe go 50/50 or some split between the 2
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:40:55
Get rich quick scheme that sets back crypto currencies by introducing confusion

@_date: 2017-10-09 22:09:22
absolutely. It's an exchange not a bank. Execute your currency exchange and take your money once it's complete..
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:26:49
I wonder how lending would work in a bitcoin world
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:01:18
What happens if they burn up in a fire? for example. I feel like ultimately however you choose to store bitcoins cold you need to use a safe or safety deposit box
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:28:22
I agree with you. Some people can’t figure it out yet whether they have the money or not. Some people need an assist to get into it. I’d rather be an ambassador to crypto than some a rich asshole concerned with rubbing my success in people’s faces
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:59:16
Coinbase is a fantastic exchange service.. BUT.. Do not keep your decentralized currency on a centralized currency exchange.  Coinbase is not a bank and cryptocurrency is not fiat. You are just asking for trouble and heartbreak.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:45:15
haha I like that strategy
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:02:42
I worry about people like you
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:25:55
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:25:54
Care to explain?
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:25:08
Then good for them. It was well played.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:56:39
Whoah you’re right! That’s awesome 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:56:28
I don’t think would work actually.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:17:56
What's your point? If you're storing any real amount on coinbase, you should at the very least be using their vaults and not just the wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:52:42
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:52:18
What’s your point?
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:25:00
Thanks for the detailed explanation. I think it's about time I go hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:04:16
If by long-term you mean like 10 years, do you worry about the hardware no longer working/failing? And where do you keep the hardware itself so that it doesn't get destroyed?
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:15:21
That's just bad advice. Coinbase is not an ideal place to park a large quantity of BTC. And if you do, you damn well better at least be using the vault.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:43:22
Thanks for the thoughtful response. I really enjoy reading your perspective. I probably didn't frame my intent properly by saying "park cash". I'm still learning the lingo :) I have been considering buying a bitcoin or 2 to hang onto for 3-5 years. This would be a small % of my overall investments. I'm really interested in alternative investments outside of US/International equities &amp; bonds as I'm happy with my current positions there. I also have other equity positions based on my profession. Precious metals and REIT's seem OK but don't excite me. And many other interesting investments cost more than 10K to buy into. Any suggestions on interesting investments?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:00:40
lol you can't be serious 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:50:10
That would be awesome if Steam accepted bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:59:44
That's why a sell strategy is so important!
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:44:42
That’s not how the term “fork” is used elsewhere. You fork off of something. Take version control systems for example. You start off with a branch and fork from it. The original branch is itself not a fork because there was nothing to originally fork from
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:03:56
What’s your point?
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:30:56
Well that is the difference. Ledger is just a key to start your car so to speak, same with bread. With ledger you can technically use your seed outside the hardware wallet to generate your private keys if need be although it’s not recommended. The real benefit is the fact that it’s a cold wallet
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:42:02
Well exchanges should only be used to exchange fiat for crypto. They are not a bank for storing currency. Once you complete the exchange, make sure to move it to Your wallet
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:50:47
Lol seriously this is pretty fantastic 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:24:32
Ahh I misunderstood what you meant 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:20:51
Thanks for the writeup!
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:10:11
Why do you think this?
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:54:38
When I hear of people that bought it so early... I'm mostly impressed by the fact that they've held it for so long! Good on you for not selling off @ 1,000, for example
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:21:19
IF. Good luck timing the market. It's a recipe for disaster in most cases 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:33:19
Don’t leave your decentralized currencies on a centralized service like Coinbase! You are asking for trouble 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:15:54
Actually HODL is a common term in crypto investing
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:32:16
This, but it’s All a gamble. 
“The future's uncertain, and the end is always near
Let it roll, baby roll”
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:34:40
I would not recommend storing more than $100 of BTC on bread 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:37:07
Cmon man........
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:36:16
Everyone should have cryptocurrency if for no other reason than to be educated about this monumental currency shift.
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:20:51
Mobile 2FA is weak and is what most people use. Even using an authenticator app isn’t hack proof 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:23:43
 read about security 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:23:49
And that’s fine. As I said I’m speaking about people with significant money on coinbase. Leave on there what you’re willing to lose via a simple hack
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:29:29
Cold vs hot

It’s true! Imagine how many people who’s coins would be stolen if somebody hacked their gmail account because it’s all on a web service. Can’t say we didn’t warn them 
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:22:50
Yea but where do you store That phrase? If you decide to store it offline, it can be destroyed along with the hardware
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:54:05
When you initialize a new repository you specify the original branch name. Every other branch is a fork of the original branch.
Here’s another example of forking:
Notice how easy it is to visually detect the root and the forks
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:12:56
Why would you store anything significant on coinbase? It's all risk no reward.
I can understand people leaving some coins on an exchange while actively day trading but coinbase is not that kind of exchange. If you are holding as an investor I cannot think of any good reason to allow coinbase to maintain ownership over your coins. Way too risky for my tastes.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:53:08
That was smart of you though to buy in at different times. It's really hard to be patient :) but it's wise to spread your investment money out over a period of time
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:20:37
I’m only using it to provide a visual example. I understand that branches themselves can’t be declared root and commits don’t carry with them branch history. But we still can know what the root branch is by tracking it even if it’s not an official feature of the system (git) as demonstrated by github. It sounds like we agree on things in a technical sense
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:27:18
Thanks, appreciate the info. I will look into picking up a nano s.
Edit - is there a store people recommend using for purchasing the nano? Amazon?
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:37:14
You can order a ledger off amazon and have it within days. If you hold over $100 worth of BTC you really need to move it to cold storage
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:34:36
Absolutely! And we need to help educate these people because I don’t want to see bitcoin’s reputation take hits when people lose BTC to simple website hacks. Many people still don’t understand how to work with decentralized currency and will fall back onto the same habits they have with traditional currencies. It’s pretty easy to predict how they’ll behave as soon as somebody hacks their gmail or hacks their mobile 2FA to gain access to and subsequently wipe their coinbase account clean of all their investments
