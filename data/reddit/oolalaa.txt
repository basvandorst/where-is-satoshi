Uh oh. I think I know which neomarxist, narcissistic youtube star you've been listening to. You might wanna actually *listen* to him, though - "Freeeeeeee-maaaaaarket baaaaaaad...hurrdurrr...hieraaaaaarchy baaaaaaad...hurrdurrr...suuuuupercompuuuuuuuuters...hurrdurrr."
Although, he does keep very quiet about the supercomputers. He knows that if enough people realise his movements "solution" to the evils of capitalism/staism is deomcratically elected inanimate objects he'll quickly become a laughing stock.

*Stefan* Molyneux was a software engineer/developer by trade before he turned to philosophy full time.

Comparing digital currencies to the internet seems incredibly flawed to me. The internet was original and unique. Currency is not. Currency has existed for thousands of years, therefore bitocin is merely an *improvment* on something (gold/fiat) that has already existed.

The denial and petulance in this thread is hilarious. Peter Schiff is right - Realistically, there is little difference between regular fiat money and Bitcoin, and as things stand, it is clealry in a giant bubble.

Lol at the general "price crashing = good!!" mentality that people are desperately clinging to atm. So it's good when the price goes up AND good when the price goes down? Makes *perfect* sense. Wait..no it fucking doesn't! If the price hits 10$ 2moro the vast majority of people on this subreddit will still be saying how "awesomely awesome bitcoinz" is. "Hey look, it was worth absolutley nothing a few years ago! Now look!"

Please, for the love of all that is good and kind in this world, read and understand Ludwig von Mises' regression theorem. 
Bitcoiners harp on about 'value is subjective!' but completely ignore the fact that the greatest economist of the 20th century, the guy who expounded in detail the whole 'subjectivity determines value' apparatus that lay the foundation for economics, demonstrated that money can only originate as a prior commodity. Any money that didn't originate as a commodity first is, necessarily, by it very nature, in a bubble.

And sorry, just regarding this, North means that "A comprehensive monetary order that will replace the existing one is not going to be designed by *central planners* [which is what the Bitcoin originators were], rather it can only conceivably evolve spontaneously, as Mises's regression theorem demonstrated"

Hey, I'm firmly on the fence regarding Bitcoin. I'm just interested to see how Bitcoiners respond to some of Gary North's claims.

Remember, everyone of you half-wits who are relentlessly attacking Peter Schiff for being "ignorant" or "biased" or "lacking understanding of basic economics", who have claimed that they have lost all respect for him, you are also attacking Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard, the two greatest economists of the 20th century, because Schiff's position is drawn from, and basically identical to, the works of Mises and Rothbard.
You are saying that Mises, who developed the whole 'value is subjective' edifice, but who also demonstrated that money can ONLY come about as a prior commodity (his regression theorem), didn't understand his own theories!! You are saying that Mises was "ignorant" and "lacking understanding of basic economics", and you are essentially calling Rothbard a "moron" who "just doesn't get it". 
Just something to think about..
