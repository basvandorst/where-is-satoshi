If you purchase it, you’re correct. We were talking about if you mine it.

At the moment you earn/mine it, the value is considered income, and taxed the same as money you made at a job. If you then hold it for a year, the amount it increased in that year is a capital gain.
E.g you mine 1 bitcoin for $15k and then sell it a year later for $20k, $15k is income on your first tax return and $5k is your capital gains next year.

Your income is the worth of the coin minus the costs of mining the coin (e.g. electricity, server bills if cloud, the cost of the computer you bought). It’s sort of subjective since you could probably only count a portion of the computer cost if you use it for other things.

We have instant, free bank transfers in the US too through Zelle, which works with almost all major banks. And then other services like Venmo and Square Cash that transfer between any banks for free with a 1 day lag.
A stripe 3% (actually less than 2% for an established business) fee applies to commercial transactions, and the overhead goes toward credit card rewards, fraud, etc.

Good point. When you’re paid by an employer they hold the taxes for you, so you don’t really have to think about it.

In the US, of course. The IRS wants its money, and doesn't care where your profits come from. Even drug dealers are expected to pay taxes on their profits, without fear of incrimination.

If you purchase it, I believe you are correct. We were talking about mining it.

Of course it matters. You don’t need a corporation to claim business expenses. If you have a single person business you basically are the corporation. That’s what being “self-employed” is. It’s not some formal distinction- even if you sell shit on eBay from garage sales on the side, you are now a self-employed business. Same applies to mining.

I’m not a lawyer so I’m not sure. But I think you’d record 19k income immediately. Then, if you sold it at 5k, you’d claim the 14k loss. But you don’t get to claim that loss until you actually sell.

There’s nothing special about bitcoin in this regard. Even if you bought something at a garage sale and sold it on eBay for a profit, you’d be taxed the same way. It’s just that usually you’re talking such a small amount of money that no one bothers to file that way, and the IRS doesn’t bother worrying about it.

FYI you can buy vanguard ETFs on Robinhood (e.g., `VOO` which is the S&amp;P 500).
