Lol yeah dude after that "crash" a few months ago due to that China rumor I've become pretty numb to any type of extreme movement. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:24:47
Can you buy that crystal ball with BTC? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:50:10
Sure thing redditor for 1 week!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:29:52
who cares. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:04:35
Lol someone should save today's chat and post it any time there's a giant correction. The fucking ridiculousness of everyone screaming about the end of the world and the opposite sentiment as it goes back up is hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:35:25
Who cares. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:24:35
This is honestly insane to watch. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:40:20
Just for future reference, not very smart to advertise how many bitcoin you have. Basically painting a target on your back. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:33:35
That’s great that you think that. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:18:37
Everyone at this point has heard of a dead cat bounce.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:28
It's already 14k lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:18
This is my second time witnessing this but just the sheer volatility in the cap this time around is nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:41:49
Godammit I hate my senator. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:56:47
Lol 10%
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:03:03
Cool man hope you enjoyed the ride. Maybe next time you won’t invest in something until you actually understand it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:22:34
if you have been intently studying it in charts you would know that this type of volatility happens a few times a year. Why is this time any different? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:10:13
If you put in a small amount, and that amount becomes bit, you’re now used to that bigger amount. If it starts to drop you don’t want to lose all your gains so you’re comfortable with leaving with a decent profit instead of going on a crazy roller coaster ride.

I had a friend who any time he learned a new word he would keep using it in any situation whether it applied or not. So we should stop teaching morons new words. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:45:54
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:29:07
Yeah you win but so far just for being pompous. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:26:17
lol quit your whining dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:56:21
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:31:43
This is why it’s crashing lol. People don’t understand this incredibly basic concept 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:24:57


Nah that's literally gambling. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:14
Yeah this is dumb. Sorry. Literally gambling. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:22:14
Chill out guys! Cheap coins on sale!
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:11:30
jesus your history. you got some problems mayn
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:43:08
Prime material.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:46:02
Yeah pretty much everything said in these threads is bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:43:08
Prime material.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:41:04
Lol been peddling the same shit for the last few days. Why are you so adamant about this.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:36:56
This is go... ahh forget it 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:52:30
Of course because value is measured by whether or not you can wear that thing around your neck.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:31:34
No you're wrong. It's because I was going to sell yesterday and forgot my password so I couldn't.  Bitcoin must have made a mistake and thought I sold yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:17:38
What about the dude with the chart that predicted EVERYTHING
