@_date: 2019-07-09 19:32:15
Ok, here we go again:
It's true that most money is printed (I believe you used the term first btw) by banks via loaning but keep in mind that loaning money provides necessary liquidity to the economy so people can borrow money and grow their business (for example).
Banks practice fractional reserve yes but it's untrue to say that the money in your bank account isn't backed by anything. Banks are in the business of managing a basket of assets, some of which is fiat money but not all of it.
Finally, that first line only shows that lots of addresses hold Bitcoin dust. Did you really take the time to understand these statistics, it clearly shows that less than 1% of addresses hold 10 ($120,500 USD at current price) to 1,000,000 BTC, that's pretty centralized as far as wealth distribution go.
Bottom line is: whichever way you slice it, banking as a mechanism is a necessary cog of any economy, you might dislike the way banks are managed but that doesn't making banking (as: the service) any less fundamental for modern economies.
You sound like you got hurt by banks before though... is that so?
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:31:33
haha, feeling a bit angry now hey? Thought I would come for one more
2 and a half year in crypto my friend, I've heard the newbie Bitcoiner "bank are so evil" cliched rant time and time again and you my friend are new to the space, I can tell.
Now bring it on, let's lock ourselves in a neverending loop of angry messages, your turn now...
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:08:17
My bad, I was actually responding to someone's response to OP.
Anyways,  


  
Only central banks are allowed to print money, are you suggesting they are printing money to literally hand suitcases of it to their friends... that's a bit cartoonish don't you think?
Calling the fiat currency system a Ponzi is a bit extreme, we as a community can love Bitcoin but we should still be cautious to stick to some level of objectivity.  
The distribution of Bitcoin wealth is (at present) still extremely unequal,  just go have a look at Bitcoin's rich list:  
 [   
Or look into Bitcoin Gini's coefficient. 
It's fine to like Bitcoin **and** to criticize it.

I honestly was never talking about the Huobi address, I was referring to the statistics above that, with the distribution relative to the number of addresses. 
I think with misunderstood each other plus I, for reasons that escape me, were not really patient with the discussion and quick to snap at you so I apologize for that, I make a point to be cool and level headed in discussions on the internet but I failed that time and I feel bad about it.
Anyways, that's it for me, have a good day/evening.
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:23:53
Ok, last message from me because you're seriously wasting my time.
Nitpicking what I say is not going to change the facts my friend, go have a look at these statistics again (the distribution... at the top..., not the Huobi address or anything below), leave your ego out of this and maybe you'll see my point.
Bitcoin has very unequal distribution, this is a fact, also you've learned something about banking and its role in the economy that you didn't know, it's okay, move on.
Now go ahead and have the last word, we both know you want it.

A cryptocurrency is quite literally digital money/asset secured by cryptography.
Crypto = cryptography / currency = money
Digicash was a digital payment network secured by cryptography.
Therefore Digicash=cryptocurrency 
There are centralized cryptocurrencies and decentralized ones.
Digicash was centralized and that’s why it failed.
Imo, adding decentralization to the definition of a cryptocurrency doesn’t help because decentralization is very difficult to measure.

Jeez, no offense but you must be new man, you preach like someone who recently got into Bitcoin.
The point I was making has nothing to do with its limited supply, increase in demand, price nor trading.
I was saying that if BTC does become the world currency we could see the biggest privatization of money that the world has ever seen, massive transfer of wealth into the hands of a few whales,i am talking more centralized than banks. 
Now you in a future where the last Bitcoin has been mined, usage of the network will be permissioned by those who hold bitcoin so that others can pay for transactions or open payment channels... see what I am talking about, what will be the difference between whales and banks then?

To my point, notice the word decentralization doesn’t appear anywhere.
Again cryptography doesn’t equal decentralization.
Now go check Digicash on Wiki:
“DigiCash Inc. was an electronic money corporation founded by David Chaum in 1989. DigiCash transactions were unique in that they were anonymous due to a number of cryptographic protocols developed by its founder.”
See, it was cryptographically secured and distributed and it was money so it was a cryptocurrency BUT it wasn’t decentralized.
This will be my last post on this, nice debating with you but i feel like we’re both wasting our time here.

My comment was badly phrased, I agree with you, I meant to say that customers should have known that something was fishy because the whole premise of renting out hash power is quite dubious: why would GM incur the opportunity cost of not mining for their own profit if their mining equipment was profitable in the first place?
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:08:57
"No. Bitcoin has value because it is censorship-resistant and very scarce."
I'd say that's true and I agree with your statement but its value also depends on it being accepted by the economy at large (merchants, etc) and being convertible into fiat (a long as fiat reigns).
About being afraid of the police, maybe you would reconsider your position if the police were actually knocking on your door and proving use is very easy if you bought your Bitcoin on an exchange and went through KYC...as I said, it' all fun and games and posturing until it happens to you.

If you care about monopolies of money then you should be worried about Bitcoin my friend, most of the supply has been issued and lots of it is hugely concentrated....
Just to make my other points clear, Bitcoin has value precisely because it is possible to convert it to fiat which is a necessary gateway (for now) to large economies
PS: I used to live in a country where BTC was illegal and I can tell you that no amount of reddit bravado about being sovereign could protect you against the police knocking down your door because you used BTC (did not happen to me but you see the point)

Just a though, if you can stop people from buying/using Bitcoin you've effectively banned it, also BTC has value because it is accepted by large economies like the EU and USA, if its use were to be banned by those countries, its value  would be considerably affected, what good is a Bitcoin that you can't spend anywhere.
