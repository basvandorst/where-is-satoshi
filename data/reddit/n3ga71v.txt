"Investor A pays Investor B $10,000. Investor B sells back to A for $10,100
Did demand really go up? Did the value really go up?"
in this scenario - definitely!
a is the buyer, b is droogdealer. gud stuff!

my crystal\-ball speculation is:

2020 \~1.1\-1.3M$
...that's beeing slightly conservative :\&gt;

simple, we are still in the early adopter phase...
tech still needs some improvements. but when it hits the mainstream market, it is gonna be a tsunami.
mass adoption phase will be measured in satoshis - not bitcoin

dude, do not believe anything you read on the internet. srsly.
i would like to see btc  some day in the future for sure.
can i be sure? hell no.
all the money i put into btc i see it as a total loss.
if it goes up, fine. if it wanishes, also fine.
it was a nice gamble to this point... good luck ;)
