Inflation is not to blame for squandering resources. A society's collective spending is not solely on frivolous trinkets, as you seem to imply. When you discourage spending, revenues decline, people lose their jobs, and then have no money to spend. Repeat this cycle a few times, and you will have an economy that is totally and utterly in the shitter.

The mods on this sub should take a hard line against people admitting to investing irresponsibly. Taking out loans, mortgages, using credit cards etc. This is the result.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:31:32
Lol you're quite the goober.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:47:15
There is no need to combat it. Positive but low inflation is good for the economy. If you don't want to lose purchasing power to inflation, put your money in bonds or index funds.

Lol. I pity how deeply invested you must be to accuse people who speak negatively about Bitcon of being Wall Street shills.

Apparently Bitcoin is now only for the wealthy rather then the average Joe.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:01:15
I would consider hodlers to be speculators as well. They're just buying in with the hopes of reselling it later at a much higher price. They don't use BTC for commerce. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:02:58
Owing $9000 on a loan is not really a life destroyer. I'm talking about people borrowing &gt; $50K.
I'm not jealous, no, but I think most people wished the would have bought into bitcoin when it was far cheaper than it is now. That I was not reckless enough to blow my life savings (or take out a loan) on bitcoin, I do not regret. 
You should familiarize yourself with [hindsight bias]( Of course it looks like it was a great idea in retrospect, when the price has gone up thousands of percent. This does not change the fact that taking out loans to invest in high-risk assets is a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:01:12

If 10 million people are suddenly driving around in lambos because of selling Bitcoin, then 10 million other people are in the hole for the cost of a lambo. Bitcoin doesn't generate wealth. The realized dollars upon a sale come from other traders. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:52:22
So, according to you, during the recent 50% crash, Bitcon lost 50% of its users?

Bro, buying a Bitcoin and keeping it on an exchange is not adoption. Are you dense?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:42:15
Indeed, bitcoin's price rally this year has been entirely irrational. Though it looks like that's coming to an end.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:31:34
lol. Tell me why you'd want to spend any money today that's potentially worth twice as much next month.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:28:59
That would be a disaster. Bitcoin supports ca. 4 transactions per second. 7,600,000,000 / 4 = 1,900,000,000 seconds between transactions for each human. Or about 60 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:12:35
Stop anthropomorphizing the market. Makes you look like a goddamned loon.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:34:58
The price rallies are not driven by adoption. It's speculation, pure and simple.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:52:43
The valuations of the coins are even more baseless than stocks of the dot com era.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:23:31
But you'd be foregoing mad gains by spending your BTC at all.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:27:15
That'd be 12.2% average inflation over the course of those 20 years. I don't think so, kiddo.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:45:18
Or BCash could take preference. Nobody really knows.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:33:12
Err, no, the people who have the most to lose are naive "investors" drawn into bitcoin by dangerous rhetoric on places like r/bitcoin, that present it as a sure-fire way to get rich quick. People are taking up loans and remortgaging their house to buy bitcoin. What happens when we run out of suckers to prop the price up?
The price movements are literally the only reason bitcoin ever gets attention outside of a niche demographic. Crypto has zero chance of usurping the ultra wealthy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:43:29
USD exchange rate has nothing to do with bitcoin's success as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:33:09
Nice projection.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:35:14
Isn't it interesting how the market price for Bitcoin is supposed to be irrelevant, yet these goobers can't wait to dump their life savings into it when the price peaks?
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:37:24
Well, actually supply and demand dictate the price. The people who hold are increasing the scarcity, and those who buy in to the hype/mania increase the demand. 
Merchants who accept Bitcoin are always going to cash out to real money immediately, so for them the price is quite irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:58:13
Yes, boo me for pointing out that you shouldn't invest - and definitely not gamble - what you cannot afford to lose. IE, a pension.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:12:22
That was very unwise. You've been lucky and made a tidy profit, though. I'd cash out some of it so that you actually have a real pension in case Bitcoin goes tits up. You don't want to spend your golden years being poor and miserable.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:44:01
I'm sure you're the kind of person who would've mortgaged their house to "invest" in pets.com
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:00:08
They think Bitcoin is going to replace the world's currency. So they do (currency in circulation) / (amount btc) and think this is a bitcoin's "real value". 
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:09:20
No. Decreased demand or increased supply will make the price go down.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:47:19
Are you me?
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:32:01
He's wise for gambling his pension? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:06:03
So you took out a loan, gambled with that money, and got lucky. Doesn't make it any less of a horrible idea, and doesn't make you any less of a fool. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:46:02
None of those have any bearing on the price, nor does the price have any bearing on how useful they are. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:43:35
Hyperinflation is bad. Regular inflation (1 - 2%) is good. Deflation is bad. Read up, son.

@_date: 2017-11-30 15:21:57
Don't do it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:53:57
It's more risky than you make it seem. There's the risk that you'll lose your coins either by accident or getting hacked / scammed, there's the risk that the price will tank, and there's a "risk" that price will double. Why would I want to use a $10 bill when it could be worth $20 tomorrow?
You may brush these aside, but for the average joe they are serious considerations. Bitcoin, in my opinion, simply doesn't have any benefits over traditional payment methods, save for dark net transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:17:13
So put it in bonds or the stock market. If people didn't spend their money the economy would grind to a halt.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:37:43
Make no mistake, BTC is currently in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:37:48
Most people on this sub treat Bitcoin like a religion. It's probably closer to a cult.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:32:18
You mean like Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:48:11


lol. What are you basing this on? Almost no law-abiding citizens use bitcoin as anything other than a speculative asset. I don't see how that qualifies as a "well functioning currency".
Neither banks nor the "wealthy elites" are scared of bitcoin. You really are an utter nutter.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:34:30
Trick question. They're both fools.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:26:04
It was quite stable during the bear market that preceded this bubble.

Maybe the guy who used ":D" six times in one post.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:39:55
You can't exchange Bitcoin for gold either. It's only worth what people will pay for it on an exchange. 
At least people spend their USD instead of hoarding them hoping to get rich. The economy would not survive otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:32:43
More of a display of ignorance than an insight. Bitcoin and USD are not equatable. Stock $ABZ rising by 100% doesn't mean the USD falls 50%.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:43:09
You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how credit cards work. It's your bank's money you're spending, not your own. It's not a direct tap to your bank account. At the end of the billing period you'll have to pay them back in full or interest will accumulate.
The upside of this is that if you get robbed or scammed, the money on your checking account is not affected. The bank will help you regardless of if you're using a debit or credit card, but at least you don't run the risk of being broke when your credit card is stolen.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:41:08
sounds like you need to go see a shrink.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:33:26
There's a middle ground between a savings account and BTC, you know. 
Unless you're retired or retiring in the near future, the only thing you should have in a savings account is your emergency fund. The rest in index funds or bonds.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:08:35
You could have also just converted it to dollars.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:53:51
The risk of that is infinitesimal compared to BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:43:34
So, I can send $10,000 for 1 cent, but by the time the recipient cashes it out it could be worth only $8,000.

@_date: 2017-09-14 19:09:58
That's really irresponsible. I only hope you're young and don't have that much savings to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:15:45
Why do you care about panic sellers? Is it because you want the price to stay high?
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:14:25
The only time purchasing power matters on this sub is during bubbles. During crashes it's always the same 1BTC = 1BTC or variations thereof. It's like a mass delusion.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:02:49
This whole sub is just people pumping the price.
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:32:43


[That's exactly why it will never replace any real currencies.]( You're a fool if you believe otherwise.
Bitcoin is perfect for speculation or buying drugs on dark net markets. For everything else you can just use real money.

Choose one.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:07:36
Lol, okay - first of all, owning stocks in real companies that actually (or potentially) have revenue is not at all comparable to owning bitcoin.
Secondly, your background in software engineering doesn't really qualify you to speak about the economics of bitcoin. So leave that at the door.
Lastly, you say it was most certainly not a sure thing, but then in the same breath say luck had nothing to do with it.  Care to comment on this whimsical contradiction? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:10:06
You're basically stating that bitcoin needs more greater fools. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:32:57
Not at all comparable. I'm sure lots of wealthy Venezuelans have holdings denominated in USD.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:09:58
That's really irresponsible. I only hope you're young and don't have that much savings to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:23:42
If you think basic economics doesn't apply to bitcoin, then you're the idiot.
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:38:04
This is why the mania on this sub during bubbles is dangerous. You two aren't going to see returns anywhere near what some early adopters on this sub have lucked out with (2x, 4x, 10x etc).

This is the kind of fool I meant:
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:24:49
I was speaking in the same short-term that he was. As I'm sure you know, after the 2013 peak it took ~2.5 years for the prices to reach what they were during the peak of the bubble. People like the doofus I replied to were posting the same kind of euphoric things back then; in effect encouraging people to dump all their cash into BTC at peak price levels.
Do you think you could hold out for several years in hopes that the high prices will return, while seeing unrealized losses of up to 80%? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:16:39

I'll concede it's a long way from buying a lottery ticket if you concede that luck is the main benefactor of your Bitcoin earnings. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:11:12
Oh really? So you foresaw the 40x gains when you started buying, huh? It was a sure thing? Luck didn't have anything to do with it?
Winning at high stakes gambling also requires accepting an awful lot of risk, and requires a great deal of patience and persistence. Though, as with Bitcoin, the winners shouldn't be an inspiration of any sort to people looking to increase their savings responsibly.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:06:07
No one holds USD hoping it will appreciate over time; they invest it in things that create further value (company stock, real estate). Bitcoin doesn't really create any value, aside from being an intermediate currency for criminal enterprise. The main driver of the price is speculators such as yourself, thinking that bitcoin is a magic money making machine.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:16:50
You have to sell to actually make any money, though.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:55:09

[Or not](


It's Detroit. It probably would've gone bust either way - website or no.
Comparing crypto to the internet is ridiculous. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, but just *one* internet. And to make money with the internet, you don't buy a chunk of it and sit on it for years hoping to get rich; you have to actually provide a service that people want and can utilize over the internet.
