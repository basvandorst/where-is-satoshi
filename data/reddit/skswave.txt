Actually, there is very stong direct IO to the secure world side. Trusted input of the users PIN and Secure display to confirm the amount. The solution should provide a very high quality Instruction to be sent to the block chain with the user verifying the data that is in the signed transaction and properly collecting the users intent for that transaction.

Congrats ledger and team!
Nice video and welcome to the TEE Club. I might take small exception with "First" as I personally demonstrated the Rivetz implementation to you in Miami, Inside bitcoin, and Money 2020.... :)
I think a key point for all readers is that Money on your Phone is possible and very secure. Because you can lose your phone I am not sure I would put 1% of your personal wealth on your Phone. The important point with these technologies is that Malware should not be able to accomplish systemic loss. The tools to deliver secure visual confirmation with trusted display of the transaction details is very important.  Have a look at blog.rivetz.com for the demonstration videos from last fall.
Look forward to seeing you at the next bitcoin event or MWC. bringing hardware security to every bitcoin wallet.

The real shift is from a network of ports and IP addresses to a network of DeviceID. Blockchain could be the registration authority for the 42 billion devices. Building a network of device that use the utility transport and the new distributed apps model for storage has the potential to change the picture.

Correct the use of images and other unique traits are key to secure display being continuously monitored by the user. A simple pass phrase also works. The full initialization tools to manage secure display for millions of device will be part of the delivered solution in Q2 and will sync across your personal collection of devices.
