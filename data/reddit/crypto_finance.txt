Hello Reddit,
This is Crypto Investor. Thought I'd publish here - this subreddit tends to not love the content I post since I call it a bubble, but this might be something you all like(ish). Happy to discuss as always if anyone cares to, thank you.

Probably not. However, I see it as a possibility in college courses as professors have a lot more leverage for what classes the school makes available. The campus I work on has an Introduction to Wall Street class that goes more into practical finance than academic finance and the movement to have the class added was spearheaded by one adjunct who was a Wall Street trader. There will be professors passionate enough about cryptocurrencies to get universities to have a whole class on them as long as enrollment is there (and it should be).

There's so many ways to get exposure to gold it's not even funny. Junior miners, senior miners, futures, ETFs (leveraged if you want to go full YOLO), etc. Most of them are very easy - and more importantly, investors are much more familiar with the process of buying and selling gold than they are with buying and selling Bitcoin. GBTC is a classic case study of this. Currently trading at a 119% premium to NAV simply because it's easier to buy than Bitcoin is (at least to the people who have money). It's OTC too which makes that statement even funnier. Not that any of this is relevant to my original post here, but I disagree Bitcoin is easier to sell, at least to the public as a whole. Most of the investing public doesn't have the patience to learn the difference between a good and bad exchange, what a wallet is, etc.

Neither. Behaves like a security. Think of it like what Paypal was actually trying to achieve originally. Except imagine that instead of Paypal removing banks, it also removed itself and all the transactions were done in "Paypal bucks" - Those "Paypal bucks" are part of the market cap. 
There's an implicit service built into Bitcoin that makes it more akin to a business than a commodity. When you buy a Bitcoin, you're buying a small share of that business. It's just that the model is different than anything else we've seen before. Can't really value it with DCF, but we do know that those "Paypal bucks" become more valuable the more people who transact with them. And Bitcoin has the secondary use as a store of value. Its lack of being tethered to a fiat currency sparks investors to come - which in my opinion, again, suggests it is more of a security than a currency. Yes you can purchase goods and services with it, but the volatility and drivers behind value are not even close to resembling what we see in traditional currencies (keep in mind that in FX, you can leverage up to 50 times or more due to the relatively small movements in that market).

New to reddit (as a user), but thought people might be interested in this. I also published an article on Seeking Alpha that is a bit more detailed if you prefer reading (same content as video, but more supplemental information): 
Constructive criticism is welcomed.

While I love Bitcoin, I don't think it will ever dethrone gold as the be-all, end-all hedge. Bitcoin needs bull market conditions to thrive. An abundance of capital gives visibility to the asset, strong stock markets encourage investors to chase performance and look for alternatives as projected returns are lowered. For now, regulations are friendly but they may become constrictive. 
If the stock market enters bear territory (which it doesn't look like it will for at least a year or so) and capital starts becoming restricted, Bitcoin likely will start increasing its correlation with markets. Not to mention that as we see the rise of futures, options, and ETFs based on Bitcoin, we should see a significant rise in correlation between it and stock markets. Gold loves bear markets - I am certain Bitcoin won't. Keep in mind Bitcoin has not experienced a single bear market since it has been actively traded by investors (2009 really doesn't count as Bitcoin was too much in its infancy).
Still like Bitcoin in the portfolio, but please - Gold will always be the true "hedge." Bitcoin is great for growth plus SOME hedge qualities. Note that it also doesn't show high correlation when it's over localized political concerns (e.g: tax reform doesn't rile up Bitcoin - it has to be global security threats or huge economic threats like Brexit).
EDIT: If anyone's interested, I talk about this in more detail, both in video and article format:  /

@_date: 2017-08-31 00:40:07
It's not really a projection. It's that this is the only way for traditional investors to invest in Bitcoin without having to understand any of it or the exchanges. GBTC has also stated they will not be purchasing additional Bitcoin - there is a limited number of shares for the fund. As such, its NAV (Net Asset Value - in this case, the actual value of the Bitcoins it holds) is much lower than the price the fund trades at. Why? Because many investors understand OTC better than they understand GDAX / Gemini / etc + wallets (not to mention many are likely hesitant due to all the bad publicity many exchanges get) and this is one of the only funds that gives exposure to BTC on that market. The premium that price trades at over NAV has fluctuated over time and is another way to play the markets. Lately, GBTC has been akin to a leveraged position in Bitcoin.
EDIT: Also the fact that it can be bought in an IRA (some of them at least) goes a long way too.

Not a history of Bitcoin, but this course (which you can watch the majority of with the free trial) is fairly accessible to most people and is both technical and conceptual:

No matter how you look at it, there's no way that this is right. I'd never invest in BTC out of an IRA - that's your nest egg and your protection from yourself. Is an unwritten rule that you shouldn't touch it - Invest in BTC with your taxable account funds.

Hey that's all good! I think many people underestimate the effect of 10 - 15% of trading volume all of a sudden having to scramble, not to mention the additional 2 - 3% of total trading volume from Tether that is on other exchanges.
These catalysts have a chance of actually happening (in my eyes). If you would like more of the black swan style events, check out the comments in the link I sent above ( I frequently debate crypto with him on Seeking Alpha - he goes to the furthest extent possible (e.g: impact of nuclear war, mass EMPs, North Korean funding, loss of network infrastructure, etc.) While I think some of that stuff is fun to think about, I generally don't see it as particularly likely.

Shiller is great. This isn't really the call of the century though. Many of us know Bitcoin is in a bubble. Just a question of when it'll burst. Plus many of us, despite knowing it, still continue to hold as we believe in 10 years it'll be worth more so even if it crashes to $2,000, it's not a big deal.
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:54:15
My issue is the "for those who pay attention" part - Many don't. Tons of this type of activity going on and very little buzz about it aside from Bitfinexed. It happens on all the exchanges to some extent, although GDAX is an easy target given how visual the order book is.

@_date: 2017-09-16 02:37:20
Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is an OTC option that lets you get essentially a "leveraged" position in Bitcoin. Each share is worth 0.09242821 BTC and they trade at a significant premium to BTC as they can be purchased through more traditional means + can be used in an IRA. At the time of writing this, premium is 78%. Throughout history, average has been closer to 40%. However, since the boom in August, premium has been around 70 - 75%. I wouldn't recommend trading it unless you know how to trade the premium.
P.S: If you're curious how the premium doesn't get arbitraged away, it's because new shares in the fund are locked for a period of time (I believe 1 year) before you can sell them, effectively limiting the float and making it impossible to arbitrage given the volatility in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:15:51
Problem with this one is that it is still the same premise that pisses people off in first place.

It is difficult to capture moments like these because you need to be looking at the right time and be able to hit record fast enough, but this time I was able to.
Note that you can interpret it differently than I did. Since we were in a general uptrend at time of recording, it could have been that the spoofer was attempting to give illusion of high volume, which would push more buy orders onto book and help fill the sell order. It also could have been a manipulation to break buy wall in the event that the spoofer wanted price to go up rather than down. Regardless of interpretation for direction influence, this is market manipulation and it happens frequently. Keep an eye open for it.
I missed it in the video, but there were also several orders at exactly 5 BTC sitting under the highest bid as well, so going to imagine this was an attempt to move markets up. This is more traditional spoofing that you read about frequently - the illusion of more depth on one side of the order book than there really is.

News flash: We're in the Wild West. You should see how many imposters there are on YouTube promising massive returns if you just give them some Bitcoin. There's even a professionally built, well advertised version of this in a platform called "BitConnect" - You may have heard of it. We're getting more and more mainstream as time goes on, but for now, it's still a dog eat dog world.
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:27:29
My interpretation is that it's not a get rich quick deal, which no one should want it to be anyway. It's going to have flows and ebbs of capital, it may take a while to reach $10k, but it is good for the long-run. To the moon mentality, as fun as it can be, is often dangerous and I for one am glad to see less people viewing Bitcoin that way and more on its merits. On flip side, I think many investors (unlike this particular one) have invested just because price has gone up a lot and their friends are getting rich off it so ... who knows.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:09:14

Okay sorry that's not my actual reaction, but I use that video any chance I can get. Not everyone knows, which means it is manipulating people. This isn't "just information" either even if everyone knew - it's still a blatant attempt to send false signals to the market. That's like saying a phishing website is just another website if everyone knows what it is - regardless of how many people know, it's still a scam. And again, not everyone knows.

Not to be a Debbie Downer ( but this is just an opinion piece so it's not particularly an endorsement from WSJ. In addition, I'm not so sure the "religion" comparison where 10,000 people believe Bitcoin has value will help convince anyone over that are saying Bitcoin has nothing backing it. What we need is someone heavily respected from traditional finance to do their homework, present BOTH sides of Bitcoin (yes, there are downsides too) and then convince people by telling them why it should have value and why that value will continue to increase. However, this was a good start and it is a sizable article in the actual paper so bravo. /off Debbie Downer

It wouldn't affect Bitcoin directly, but you're missing the bigger picture. It's similar to how all stocks move in the same direction even when certain events should have no bearing on certain individual stocks due to systematic risk.
Being more specific, a lush ICO economy leads to extensive visibility from VCs, wealth managers, and accredited investors. They become exposed to the entire cryptocurrency scene. I work with two wealth managers who wouldn't know a thing about Bitcoin if it wasn't for what they heard about blockchain applications. One of them is considering buying. They are whales.
It's a domino effect - same reason the market went down 30 - 40% over China despite only 10 - 15% of volume being driven from their exchanges. Same reason the entire economy collapsed in 2008; everything is interlinked even if it isn't directly affected.

Not even close lol ... Don't get me wrong, I think the guy is an idiot as much as the next guy when it comes to Bitcoin, but banking is doing just fine. Even more so if Trump goes after Dodd Frank. Not stating my opinion on whether or not that's good, but given people are so against FUD against Bitcoin, there's really no reason to FUD banking when they're chugging along. I'm all for bashing them though.

Hello everyone,
This is a video I did with insights on how the two corrections we saw this weekend didn't cause a crash and why I don't suspect one coming anytime soon. I also discuss correlations between major cryptocurrencies and my opinion on regulatory risk. 
This particular video also has a corresponding article I had published on Seeking Alpha (an investing website traditionally for stocks) which you can find here: 
My YouTube videos get very little visibility right now so would appreciate any love as it goes a long way for getting the YouTube AI to put my videos in recommended / search engine results. As usual, I'm happy to discuss here with any of you (seriously, check how active I am on SA; I'll happy give in-depth responses here). Thank you.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:17:00
I like it, just feels a bit cluttered. You know, it's funny but I honestly think with a better title, this post probably would have done a lot differently. Lesson learned though!

I'm not sure why I'm replying; this will be the last time. However, I just want to point out that the article wasn't about small pops (hah). It was about ways in which we could see Bitcoin go below $2,000 again. The $2,700 comment is related to our current situation with China, independent of a full version of any of the catalysts I mentioned. *Tips fedora*

From my posting history:
"If you're leaving there til next year, I'd just wait on all of these minus maybe Waves since it's not a "major" in my opinion. Despite what others might tell you, prices don't just go up forever. For reference, in the month of August:
Bitcoin: +63.58% Ethereum: +87.88% Litecoin: +65.18%
There will be a major correction at some point in the next 12 months - don't let those who post the skeleton at the computer meme confuse you. And when it happens, you'll certainly be able to pick up Bitcoin below $4000, Ethereum below $300 and Litecoin below $60. Ethereum in particular has some significant longer-term risks now if we see SEC crackdown on ICOs. Regardless, this is not the time to be a buy and holder. Either trade the market, or be patient and wait for a panic sell to pick up your favorites for cheap."
It's all for a good bit of fun mate. Also I'd recommend selling your car and buying a junker. Put the remainder into Bitcoin. Then later on sell the Bitcoin to buy a lambo.

Help me think of a catchy title that gets clicks. When you write something this long, you do want to lure people in somehow and the title + thumbnail usually do it. Seriously, it's actually quite a tough proposition. I spent a while on it. The other main title I came up with was "How the Bitcoin Bubble Will Pop." My Seeking Alpha editor came up with "Bitcoin: What Will Be the Final Straw?" which got 34% of clicks, literally 1% behind "How the Bitcoin Bubble Will Pop" on SA. Thoughts? If you make it too light, no one clicks.

I provide your counterargument in part related to ICOs, although not specifically to UK. Yes, in general, we should see regulations, not bans. Still, it could lead to a significant slowdown when you consider how fast they have ramped up recently.
I would encourage you read some of the comments by this guy on Seeking Alpha:  He can be extreme, but he's well educated and I like hearing him for opposite site of argument as to whether or not governments will close all gateways in long-run.
EDIT: Oh and don't give me credit for Tether / Bitfinex. That's mostly  I just added a few parts that I don't like too. But his investigative journalism is top notch.

"Bitcoin is a strong long-term investment for anyone who understands what it offers and its perception by the greater markets currently.

Probably not - I know quite a few people in the field who feel the same way. It's just that people they respect say it, so it must be true. It's hard to trust people that are brand new (most people involved in Bitcoin), so they stick to the old names they are familiar with. To be fair, Bitcoin enthusiasts also generally ignore most people from traditional finance, even those with fair criticisms that give Bitcoin a chance. It is just a schism between finance and Bitcoin investors / technologists. But I'd definitely say the ignorance is stronger on the behalf of the finance crowd.

You're not really giving it up though. Bitcoin is perfectly liquid. And most of the comparisons people do are apples to oranges and gives false hope.

@_date: 2017-10-19 02:47:11
Yes, there is a huge untapped market. However, if you look at it from perspective of behavioral finance, it's hard not to see signs of irrational exuberance so I understand why people feel on the fence about it. No doubt there are people investing simply for the "Greater Fool" reason. That was made abundantly clear to me when I saw passionate defense of Bitconnect and some people saying they clearly know it is a scam and that's why you "obviously" get out before it crumbles. I've seen people like that in Bitcoin too, and I think that's what scares people which isn't THAT unreasonable. But as you mention, there is literally billions of dollars just waiting to be deployed into Bitcoin, especially whenever an ETF is approved.

For everyone looking to take advantage:
I have limit orders in Bitcoin at ~$4050, Ethereum ~$280, and Litecoin at ~$60. Place orders that you feel comfortable with if it turns out to be more than a rumor and this "private information" turns out to be correct like it was with ICO bans. Keep in mind that news coverage of it will increase throughout day as people read the paper and CNBC likely picks it up as they usually follow WSJ. Also look for more info from the Bloomberg end. As always, be cautious - don't place orders in that you will be unhappy if they fill. Keep a close eye on Chinese exchanges. Best of luck everyone.

This reminds me of the mudslinging advertisements you see during elections. Or boxing.
Commentary: Bitcoin is definitely the heavy favorite here. Undefeated and has beaten every nearly every competitor by TKO or KO. One win by decision. This is going to be tough for 2X, but he might have a chance if he uses that left replay hook. What are your thoughts given you fought the man himself?
Bitcoin Cash: Well you know, I might of technically lost, but those judges were biased and didn't really know what they were talking about. In the end, I have better technique than Bitcoin ever had and I will take the title back in our next rematch.
Commentator: 2X seemed confident in the prefight interview that he would crush you as well in a fight if it ever came to that. He even went as far as to call you "Bcash." What are your thoughts on that?
Bitcoin Cash: Well B2X has better technique than Bitcoin, but mine is still far superior. I'd crush him in the...
Commentator: Sorry to interrupt, but the fight is about to start! Here comes the announcer now.
...In the red corner we have the original, 1 mb, SegWit activated, astonishingly valued, widely accepted, undisputed champion of the world, Bitcoin! And in the blue corner, we have the hard forked, 2 mb, SegWit activated, big block but not really so big block, unanimously agreed but not so unanimously supported Bitcoin 2X!
Ref: I want a good clean fight okay? No market manipulation, no cheap replay attacks. Understand? No? Fight anyway!
Okay that's enough cringe for me today.

To be fair, most of Elon Musk's projects ARE mostly marketing, similar to Apple. The bright side is that the man very much believes in what he does and does in fact invest in technology. Steve Jobs invested in design... and was an asshole. At least Musk is genuinely attempting to advance the world and is a great guy. But I have to say, people think he can do no wrong - reality will settle in eventually when people realize that Tesla, SpaceX, and HyperLoop are all a LONG way from achieving their end goal. They are hyped as if they have already achieved it. Controversial opinion, just voicing it anyway.

Well making their own cryptocurrency that isn't fiat-backed would be kind of dumb. That would create two state sponsored currencies. However, there is a lot of work going on right now with creating fiat-based cryptocurrencies such as Utility Settlement Coin and CitiConnect. There are other projects too, worldwide. The defense traditional crypto has is that it is decentralized and hence censorship resistant. To truly outlaw Bitcoin &amp; other cryptocurrencies, you would need to coordinate an attack on it by many nations. I just don't see USA, Russia, and China all getting in bed together to fight against Bitcoin, especially when many top ranking government officials LIKE Bitcoin and that number will only grow as more of the younger generation comes into the political scene. Forget the fact you'd also need to get Japan, UK, Switzerland, Singapore, and many other countries to join in as well (I listed the 3 I did not due to influence on market, but because of their inability to work well together).

Does anyone else get tilted when they hear this on CNBC or some other source of traditional finance media? It's an echo chamber.

Hello Reddit,
This is another rather lengthy piece that I wrote, and hopefully the title is a bit less offensive this time. It's fairly deep, so if you don't have much exposure to finance, the video may be better since I break to explain more there (the article was originally written with Seeking Alpha in mind, where it is currently pending). I hope you all enjoy it regardless and find maybe some bits of it useful.

Roller coaster guy never stays in one direction too long it feels.

This gets worse than politics, which is impressive!
