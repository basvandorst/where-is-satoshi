Alright  and  , I've heard you and I'll make sure that my next postings are more geared towards educational content instead of personal.
I figured since I was just introducing myself to the Reddit community, a community I'm not very familiar with, that I would include my recent Medium post that goes a bit into my personal experience during my time as a Crypto daytrader.
However your constructive feedback is duly noted. I'll keep my more personal postings out of this subreddit since I see that my humanity is clearly not welcomed.
Also, FWIW, I didn't shill anything and if you actually spent the time to read / learn about my recent doings, I have moved away from monetization of 'calls' or 'signals' &amp; have rebranded into a more professional image on social media platforms.
Lighten up a bit, eh?

That's exactly what most people think, and the fact that they won't even allow open discussions about it on their public 'Trollbox' just adds to the disturbing thoughts.

What do you mean?

Noted. Thanks. Do you know of a good subreddit that is open to trading discussions?... Since I'm a trader...
@_date: 2018-05-15 05:53:25
I'm posting about trading cryptocurrency which includes Bitcoin.
Grow up. I'm trying to contribute to the community and you're response is to... what? Be toxic?

Go read the article that I posted above on the main post. They have a &gt;&gt;FOR PROFIT&lt;&lt; in-house trading Market Maker that gets special treatment.
I think that this market maker now makes the majority of the profits for this exchange and is most likely, now, a major player in deciding where the price of BTC goes.

Idk how to notify you of my response shown below... so I'll just post this here and tell you to read my response to 'dalebewan' below.
P.S. Care to educate me on the workings of Reddit so that I won't have to do another post like this?
If your response is toxic or not helpful, just don't bother responding... please.

tl;dr :
"I sold the dip, and bought the tip."

The truth? This is my opinion that someone shared on a shitty Reddit board that I highly dislike.
I'm a trader. I play this game for $$$. I could give a shit less about either side.

Free hugs?
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:33:35
Lol... I'm pretty sure they are going to ban this?... I don't even know if the Reddit community knows who I am, haha.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:43:05
It's not a super emotional post. I'm just a vulgar asshole. Stupid cunt.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:35:18
Look Ma, I'm famous! :D

I don't specialize in Blockchain, but unless you're an IT Specialist, I more than likely have more IT certificates and experience than you.

Some noob.

If you knew anything about me, you'd know that I always preach to never margin.
Maybe you should learn a thing or two.
