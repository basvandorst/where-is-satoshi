You're very much wrong, by the time the Eastern Roman Empire met it's demise, the writing was very much on the walls. They all saw it coming, but held on as long as they could.
**EDIT:** To extrapolate, the Byzantines went down fighting against the invading Ottoman Turks led by Mehmet II in 1453. They knew it'd end with them.

Yeah, they all seem to miss the fact that the CNY is not a hard currency and doesn't freely float.

You're anachronistically cherry picking history there. Rome burned during the reign of Nero in 64AD due to reasons lost to history, but was not "promptly sacked" afterwards. Actually, the final "fall of Rome" was unceremonious, as the Western Empire fell in 476AD as the emperor abdicated his throne. However, at that time Constantinople was already the political, commercial and military capital of the (Eastern) Roman Empire, which continued the Roman tradition for another 1,000 years after the Western Empire fell. It finally meet its end in 1453AD.

Another thing to point out is that even though the Chinese Yuan is "floating" in a "currency basket", it's all political smoke and mirrors, as it is mostly pegged to the dollar still.
So, even when they're "not trading in dollars", they still are until China actually floats it's own currency. Until then, it's all bullshit. You can't get rid of the dollar if you reserves are stocked with it and your currency is pegged to it.

Maybe the USD is experiencing problems, but what replaces it?
