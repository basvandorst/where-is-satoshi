While it is volatile it does move like a traditional market and can be semi predicted. Check out [ there are a lot of smart people on there who follow and predict btc pretty accurately.

I scalped my profits. I see this as a short lived bounce before it drops to another low. Where I will put the profits made on this bounce. I'll thank the whale who caused this later

On the extreme end $7,500-$7,800 but on the mid $8,500 and more likely $9,000. Btc doesn't have enough volume buyers to sustain the current price fluctuation and will more than likely come down. I'm still a bull for the end of the year at 20k tho. So even if you bought now it would be worth it, just not cost effective.

So you're saying shorting is considered a bear control also?

That is terrible advice. Btc went up because a whale dropped a ton so they could pump and dump. Wait for the dip  .

That's the smartest move I think.

I 100% agree. The rise was a bubble and btc needs to come down for support before it takes off for another ATH.

Sorry, I mean shorting bitcoin, much like people short certain stocks hoping the price will go down.
