I don't think I am. I'm actually working on trying to get permissive legislation enacted for Bitcoin while I know many others who are pushing for strict regulation. What governments want is simply protection for the public and efficiency in the financial system. Governments don't want control over your life. What they want is to protect others from you and you from others. If you are hostile towards government action you will be considered and rightfully so as a threat.

I mean within the Bitcoin ecosystem. You are willing to mingle with criminals to make profit? I guess I misjudged this community.

What I meant to say was that Governments can influence market demand. If they do and the market crashes you'll have little to no use for bitcoins since bitcoin is only information and its only use is for transmiting value where gold for instance will always be used to manufacture products that require its physical properties. You can't operate without consent from governments. You just cant.

I can eat an apple. I cannot eat a bitcoin. I will live an other day with an apple. Not with a bitcoin.

You won't go far. If you resist government action will be far worse than you expect.

Bitcoins don't have an intrinsic value. Their value is derived from the belief that people will want Bitcoins in the future. Governments can severely limit the market with a ban in which case Bitcoin would only be used by fanatics and for illegal activities. Assuming these are relatively small sectors, we can conclude that using Bitcoin would not have a good risk/reward for the common folks which would kill its ambition to become mainstream. People like the security the government provides. There is certainly a way for Bitcoin to be integrated within a legal framework of some sort without it becoming pointless. This is the only way it will ever become widely used.
