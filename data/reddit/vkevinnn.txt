I like Gemini as an alternative and they let you start buying immediately, but... there’s no USD tether! Which means you cant have funds ready to go or on the side avoiding volatility. Gemini also had bad ratings just like coinbase on the exchange reviewing site. I just want that usd tether though

It seems everybody is panic selling. I'm not worried but if people continue it would be a nice play to sell and buy back in right before futures. I have no idea if it will continue to drop though, any input anybody?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:39:25
People are scared, I want to sell now and take advantage and buy back in right before futures but not sure if the price continue to drop

I thought a lot of stocks looked good in my very amateur opinion. I'm literally just getting into stocks very recently and have been following some trends. For now the risk reward seems better to invest most of my new portfolio into bitcoin so I'll do that but I thought Amazon at a low looked good Netflix too, Sony, I got some EA stock cause investors really got scared of what gamers were saying and I think EA will bounce back at least somewhat with all different games. Thought the stock market was on a good run and rising?

Thanks I started using the mobile site but, beginners be warned if your sitting on a price drop to buy, it's going to take a week for my funds to be deposited into my gdax usd wallet just so I can buy BTC.

That's too covenient for coinbase atm. Wish I started on Gemini then but I heard they were growing and gdax was better because it was more established

Thanks, thinking about selling this high to buy low. My BTC total investment is super low right now so I could use and extra way to get more

That's very nice but considering your son is only one year old. What was your goal for getting into bitcoin in the first place? Your counting on deflation of bitcoin vs inflation of the usd. Meaning you cashed out but your betting that the fiat you cashed out is going to retain its value somewhat in order to be able to pay for college expenses in 17 years. Right now your betting on fiat vs bitcoin over the next 17 years, that seems like a really long value play. I would say most people in bitcoin believe without a doubt bitcoin will be more common place and valuable 17 years from now.
I think it would make much more sense to be able to cash out and pay that asset now like if your son was about to go to college you could cash some out and pay it to ensure he wouldn't have any debt. But your storing it in fiat which will depreciate significantly over 17 years, thoughts?

150billion transfer and a fee of $5!!? Damn... and here coinbase is charging me $7 for a $200 transfer
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:28:07
I don't mean how soon would the price drop I just mean how soon would I be able to use those funds sold to buy again

Not too bad, just a mistake on my part. Another huge mistake is I thought the futures were happening next Sunday, my plan was to sell before futures and take advantage of the dip which would have worked out but I failed again with a bad mistake

I bought some at 10.5k and tried to buy $1000 but funds were transferring for the past week so I bought with coinbase debit fees at 14.5k and 17.5k.

So should I switch or is using gdax fine and fast once usd wallet is funded
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:49:32
People still waiting to buy low... this sucks for them and me cause I've been waiting a week plus for gdax funds to be deposited
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:34:46
How can I do that? I would've have capitalized on 50% growth instead I'm barely even.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:57:50
What's the difference your pointing out? Does it transfer from bale to funds quickly or does it let you buy directly from debit card? Or let you margin trade?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:45:25
For how successful bitcoin and coinbase is its insane how a deposit of funds can take 9 days to complete and I'm taking about $100 USD at a time. This stuff is supposed to all electronic and quick, it should take thirty seconds not 9 days! So frustrating missing out on 50% gain!
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:13:14
If I sold on gdax my btc which would get sent to my usd wallet funds how soon good I buy when the price drops  instantly? A day? Or 5 days��?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:46:22
Margin trading if that's what your talking about, it seems it's disabled or you require at least some funds for it to be available.

How would a beginner go about investing and managing easily on iOS phone. Right now I use Coinbase but I heard their fees are inflated compared to gdax but I have no idea how I would switch or if that can be done on mobile. I appreciate the mobile aspect that I can always check and buy and sell.
