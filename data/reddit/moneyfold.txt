I mean everyday (not only on weekends) :)

Futures markets are meant to help with price discovery (by enabling arbitrage between spot price and future price),  hedging, enabling shorting, etc. So the advent of bitcoin futures is not a bad thing. I wonder if anyone has tried to build a bitcoin forward curve yet. The drawback is there might be front running and other price manipulations going on. It will take time for the market to mature.

Maybe so in the developed world. In emerging markets they will leapfrog "Modern" Payment Systems.

Personally I really like both. Just want to spark some debate. If RSK is very successful, do we really need LN?

Initially I read it as Litecoin, Nebraska... took me a few seconds to realise :)

It seems to me that it is an either-or situation, whereby you would use one, but not the other. I know they are not openly going against each other or one could say they solve slightly different problems. It feels a bit like MacOS vs Ubuntu - these two are not really competing with each other head on, but if you use one,  you don't really need the other.

Looks cool (and expensive)...

sry to hear that. at one point 3 years ago I was down 80%, but hodling and that shufflin song helped me get through.

For example, on Ethereum-type chains an atomic swap between ERC-20 tokens (Augur-for-Rivetz or OMG-for-USD). On UTXO chains an atomic swap between digital assets - for example coloured coins or other digital assets (check MultiChain).

Agreed... but with ~1.4 million daily circulation if half of the readers read the article, that's a positive contribution to crypto. My colleagues will no longer ask me if bitcoin is a special item in Candy Crash.

Cool... going mainstream.

Partially. First you need fiat on the blockchain. Moneyfold provides this service in a regulated way in the UK with full reserve. Once your fiat is on-chain, atomic swaps indeed remove the need for centralised exchanges between assets on that chain. Cross-chain atomic swaps are more complicated.

Wow... Arizona catching up to Switzerland in this regard. Good on them.

Try Cumberland Mining - 
They usually do up to 500 BTC ($5 mil) per side and deal in 20+ cryptocurrencies. Ping me direct if you need help.

Bottom line is... BTC electricity consumption is a rounding error when looking at global figures and most of the energy is form hydro-electric sources - i.e. renewable.

I get asked this question at every conference. My recent response is that BTC consums the equivalent of 0.21% of annual US electricity consumption and I quote this recent Bloomberg article with precise figures:
