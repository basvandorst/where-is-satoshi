You need a traditional debit only card which doesnt support tap function and no visa/master logo in order for your card to work with interac online. I got mine from BMO. The teller told me that they have to manually orrder the card and i waited few days to recieve the card.

No its not true that u cant sell in canada. Maybe you heard it from coinbase users. You can buy and sell no problem with guadrigacx which is Vancouver based. I ve tried selling once and did bank wire/transfer and it worked without any problems.

in korea we use red for up blue for down same thing goes for stock market. and to be honest most koreans dont even know how cryptos work and what purposes they serve they just buy and sell because it makes them money quickly. I also am korean and i hope some day ppl realise/learn why we invest in bitcoin and the importance of it.

There's a cafe in downtown vancouver called Waves Coffee which has Bitcoin ATM and there's a internet cafe called Robson Internet which has one too. But selling thru atms will get you less CAD compared to selling on a an exchange. I think using banks will get you more CAD...

This. even with 3.99% fee from cpinbase the prices are higher in quadirga so it cancels out or even better.

if you want to buy large amounts like &gt;$1000 use quadriga, for small amounts use coinbase. What i do is I buy weekly from coinbase, transfer it to gdax once in a while since theres no fees for conbase to gdax and then to you own wallet. Later on when you want to sell, use quadriga.

literally every single person who owns smartphone in korea has kakaotalk installed. even my grandma uses it.+ theres a rumor that they will be working on crypto trading service in kakaostock which is already well known for stock trading.

you can sign in with coinbase account but you need extra verification. i uploaded my passport extra verification. once you can login you can move funds between gdax and coinbase
