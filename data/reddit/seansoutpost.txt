We have had no incidents at Satoshi Forest, none. Zero. We won our case against the county for land use violations in May of 2014 and in March of 2015 we won the county's appeal of that verdict. We have been inspected monthly by the state of Florida for over two years as to the health and sanitation quality at Satoshi Forest. And we are consistently marked at the highest rating available on that inspection. The magistrate who ruled in our favor in our case, on video, the county commission said they would fire her and get someone who would play ball. She has indeed been replaced. 
No resident is filing this complaint. They have tries multiple times and have no leg to stand on. The county changed the land use code after they lost their appeal to specifically target what Satoshi Forest does, and we were cited for violation within 30 days of that new code coming into effect (Jan 1, 2016). 
That's what this case is. It is the county citing us for having tents. 
The county is in plane words asserting to us they have no problem with the homeless sleeping at Satoshi, they have a problem with them having tents. 
The same thing happened in 2013 with the city of Pensacola. They said they have no problem with homeless people sleeping in parks, they just can't have blankets to sleep with. These are ancillary ways of saying "we don't like homeless people " without having to actually say that.

10 bitcoins.

Presumptuous? Possibly. Greedy, I wouldn't think so. But you are welcome to draw whatever conclusions you want from it. Homelessness in America is a HUGE problem. That is not getting better. In fact it is getting dramatically worse. 
1000BTC is a ton of money. But it is a drop in the bucket compared to what is spent. For instance the "Waterfront Mission" the largest homeless outreach in Pensacola had revenues of over 14 Million for this year. And in Pensacola, they fed 54,000 meals compared to our 30,000.
Charity is broken in this country. Beyond broken. The means and methods being utilized are both hamstringing people that want to do legitimate good and providing havens of abuse and excess for those who want to take advantage. It is sick.
At Sean's Outpost, our mission is to find sustainable solutions to homelessness and hunger. Not homelessness and hunger in Pensacola. We have the ambition and audacity to think that what we are doing could become a blueprint for "disrupting" the non-profit sector as a whole. Replicating what we do globally. We want to see sean's Outpost charters anywhere there is a need for them.
I will take audacious. We are audacious. Someone has to be. These things don't change on their own. 
As to how we would use 1000BTC, I first want to thank you. That is supposing both that I don't die running across the country and that we actually raise 1000BTC. Those are big ifs. Coindesk asked me how much I wanted to raise. I said 1000BTC. My daughter also says she wants a pony. It doesn't mean she has a pony in her future. 
But 1000BTC is not out of the question. It is doable. And no matter how much we raise. We will bleed the ever loving shit out of it and get the most people helped possible with it. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 17:43:44
Just to clarify, they approached us and said they were excited about the conference and wanted to support us. They did this all on their own.
@_date: 2014-10-28 01:02:28
It's not that they are easy to fake. I just take issue with needing government permission to help people. It's also very messed up that a homeless outreach needs to spend lots of money and wait over a year to achieve 501c3 status when that same staus is simply granted, self certified, to churches.
If no one ever stands up, nothing will ever change. 
People should contribute to humanitarian aid because they choose to. Not because they are forced or for a tax break.
And we are well aware that hinders us to some types of funding. Money isn't everything.
I really appreciate your donations. No hard feelings at all. Criticism is important and necessary.

I couldn't agree more.
No one should trust me, or anyone in the Bitcoin community. Not because I'm untrustworthy, but because the point of cryptocurrency is to be trustless.
In embracing a solution for that, I admit we have been remiss. But it's only because we have been entirely focused on trying to provide and improve the services we do provide.
Let me start by saying I, Jason King, do not derive any salary or monetary compensation from Sean's Outpost. In fact, the cost of running Sean's Outpost has greatly outpaced the amount of donations we have received. The additional costs of operating have to date been covered by wife and I.
The only board member who receives compensation is Michael Kimberl, who is head of operations for Sean's Outpost Pensacola. YTD he has been paid $21,500, which is low for both field of work and geographic area.
While we may not have optimal "blockchain reporting" all our works are very open and available to the public, everyday. We provide over 2,000 meals a week to the homeless in Pensacola and another 250+ in Dallas.
You can just show up, anyday and watch the meals being prepared and delivered. 
To date we have fed over 125,000 meals to the homeless. Our cost of production and delivery of meals has been publicly disclosed from day 1 and averages $1.25 per meal, delivered.
We also own, operate, and pay mortgage on Satoshi Forest, a 9 acre homeless sanctuary. We pay $600 a month mortgage, $200 for sanitation services, $75 a month for water, $250 for dumpster and between $100 and $200 a month for inspection services from the department of health and human services.Which, by the way, has consistently been given the highest rating available in Florida. 
We have also defended the right to operate Satoshi Forest in court four times. And won. Our pending lawsuit brought against Satoshi Forest by Escambia country was dropped earlier this month.
Since January, we have also operated Satoshi Thrift, a thrift store and homeless services center. Most famously, it was used as the only available shelter in Pensacola when Pensacola flooded in April. The lease on the 11,000sf facility is $2300 and has a utility cost of around $600 per month. The future of Outpost Thrift is unknown at this point as we are much better at feeding and helping the homeless than running a retail establishment. We had hoped to transform the building into a homeless training center, but the funds are simply no there and we have not been able to generate enough revenue from the store to keep it in operation.
What needs to change?
One, we need a wallet that will allow for easy tagging of PAYMENT CLASS that is a requirement of sending funds from the wallet. This would make accounting automatic and not be a burden for any non profit. We could then provide a link to a graph that would show an up to the minute breakdown of funds received and how they have been spent. In addition, a way to easily provide "social proof" and attach it to a transaction would be AMAZING. Saying you bought 200 meals is nice, SHOWING the 200 meals being fed is MUCH better.
As an interim to this, we will begin manually tagging all payments 
from our public address to represent what is being paid for. We will also do a better job of streaming photos from daily operations via twitter 
We are very proud of the level of service we have been able to provide. 125,000 meals is a lot. But when you look at the scope of the homeless problem in the US it doesn't even scratch the surface. 4.5 million meals are needed DAILY. There is simply no way to scale to that.
At  I announced that we had begun work on a separate project called "Outpost Everywhere" that intended to address this issue. The idea is "Uber for Soup Kitchens" a simple app with two buttons, "Give a meal." and "Get a meal." 
If you have food to give, simply input how many meals you have and you will be geotagged as available. Need a meal? Press that button to see a list of the closest meals available to your location.
Not only do we think this has a real shot actually making a difference in feeding the hungry, we think it will allow us to generate some of the most acurate analytics of the actual homeless problem ever.
This is a separate endeavor and is ENTIRELY self funded at this point. No Sean's Outpost funds are being used to fund development. The cost and time output is squarely on myself and my lead dev, Bryce Case, aka YT CRACKER.
I think that's it. Sorry for spelling. I'm replying on my phone from a cicis pizza with my kids.

You guys are fast. 
Here's the story...
Our waterbill at Satoshi is usually $20 a month. This month it was $730. Over 80,000 gallons of water wasted. We went out to Satoshi to check it out. Cut the watermain and then went to find the LAKE. On an offshoot close to the wetlands we found the leak. We also found ground where fresh earth had been disturbed. One of those holes was over our waterline. It had been dug up and sawed clean, and then reburied. The other holes were the attempts to find the pipe.
I have no words. It's just mean and wasteful.

Transparency, or rather lack there of is the problem with most charities/non-profits. We are implementing lots of new features to make tracking everything MUCH simpler.

We currently have a paid staff of 4, not 5. Only two are full time, the other are part time.  And we just added those two in the last week. 
Currently our total weekly expenditure on paid staff is exactly $1,000 (paid in BTC, of course). We feed in excess of 3,200 meals a week, 6 days a week.  Most of the meals we feed are also during the "wrk week". The only way to ensure that many people are going to get fed consistently is to pay someone to do it. We don't dabble in this. 
And that is just feeding. It's not including any of the work we do at Satoshi Forest, Bithoc, passing out blankets, driving people to the doctor,  filling out paperwork for benefits, arguing with the police, or the countless other things that are involved with the complex issues of homelessness. 
Money makes the world go round. I like to think that we do a much better job than most in how we utilize what we are given.
We are working on a complete website overhaul. When it goes up, we will have very detailed stats on what we used donations on for 2013. And in the future, we are working on an automated system that let's you donate directly to fund the parts of Sean's Outpost you like and automatically keeps you updated on how the funds were used.
Thanks for caring enough to comment. 
And as always, anyone is ALWAYS welcome to come down here. We will be glad to show you exactly what we do on a daily basis.

So, thanks for posting. It's always good to see constructive criticism. 
I think diversity in the bitcoin charity space is essential. We absolutely have to get more charities to integrate bitcoin into what they do. I have spoken about bitcoin's benefits for charity at a number of bitcoin conferences in the US and to a great group of hackers at the Milan Dark Wallet summit. 
FYI, I am actually on the board at Bitcoin100.org, in fact it was my suggestion that prompted Bitcoin100 to donate to Khan Academy :) Bruno, the founder of Bitcoin100 spent Thanksgiving in Satoshi Forest. 
We work with Bitcoin Not Bombs. And one of their main writers, MK Lords is an active member of Sean's Outpost. We will be speaking on the charities panel at the bitcoin conference at the end of the month together.
 FOREVER!
Fr33aid is probably my favorite bitcoin charity. One, they were the first. And two they are down with some direct action. You should google their relief efforts after the Phillippines Typhoon.
They just straight up kick ass.  
BitGive is like the new kid on the block. And they have a great model. They are collecting bitcoin donations now, holding them in an endowment fund and waiting until bitcoin goes to the moon so they can cause some serious damage to the charity space in the future. 
These places are all awesome. Support them.
I think people donate to us because of our transparent nature about what we do. We try to show the impact donations make. 
Sean's Outpost is trying to figure out sustainable solutions to the problems of hunger and homelessness. And while our sandbox may be Pensacola, the work we do and the progress we make and methods we find are documented for distribution everywhere. 
We have consulted on doing similar projects in a number of countries, and we have interest in opening up Sean's Outpost charters around the world. And maybe that will happen one day.
We are very thankful to the support of this community. Thank you for everything.

Literally they took us to court, the judge found us not in violation and the county commission is now trying to actively get that judge fired. Like we have him on video saying that.
They say we are in code violation. We aren't.  We pay every week to be inspected. All our reports say no violations found.
This is literally trying to go to a different court because the first one didn't go their way.  Crybabies

It's not residential.  Our property is zoned commercial and camping is a use expressly permitted. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:01:06
Yeah, we have over 1040 homeless on the street here. We have 30 permanent shelter beds. We have 200 "temporary" shelter beds that are good for 3 days a month. 
Even if we count all these beds. What are the other 810+ people supposed to do?
We get a lot of attention, because we fight back. But this is going on all over the country. We are disavowing a group of Americans from being human. 
We have to make more people aware.
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:56:29
Doesn't the author have to remove a post? I was just responding to that guy when it told me the post had been deleted. 
Here was my response...
 You are a very classy individual. I think we can all agree on that. Kick them when they are down. 
Fr33Aid provides support to PorcFest, the largest Libertarian gathering in the country. They are a long standing trusted member of our community. It has nothing to do with website. It has to do with reputation in the commnity. Which fr33aid has in spades. 
If you are going to pick on someone, pick on us. I'm more than happy to take whatever "You aren't doing it right" rhetoric you want. 
Goto Pensacola and see us in operation. We feed more homeless every week than any other homeless organization in our county. Including the ones that have been doing it for decades. And we welcome all visitors. Anytime, please come on down.
And if you can do it better. PLEASE DO IT. There is no space more in need of disruption than the non-profit sector. Please have at it. We need more people iterating to improve.
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:07:26
Yeah, that's there math error :)
@_date: 2014-09-07 18:02:20
We make zero judgement calls on people or organizations in this manner. If you wanted me to stop dealing with criminals and assholes you are essentially telling me to stop working with the homeless. 
Here's what I said to Ars Techinica when they donated 
BFL donated to us. We put a marker on a tree. We don't have a logo on our site or anything else. Their business practices also don't negate the fact that they donated to us. It's not a judgement it's a fact, they donated to our cause. If we had a donors plaque instead, would you really expect us to chisel off the name? 
1.5 million people will be homeless tonight in the USA alone.
3.6 million people will experience homelessness this year
100,000,000 people in the US will experience some form of food insecurity this year.
We are dealing with real problems that people die from everyday. We are the largest provider of meals to the homeless in NW Florida and the largest crypto currency based humanitarian organization in the world.  
As to criminal organizations donating to charity, no, we take no money from the US Government.

@_date: 2014-10-28 00:04:20
Answered in an above thread. Was an issue with untimely paperwork. Which we have already rectified.
As to 501c3, we have been very vocal about not approving of the 501c3 system. As is Fr33Aid another prominent bitcoin charity. We believe government approval to do good is a really screwed up concept. As to transparency, I answered this on detail here...
Social proof, which we have in spades, is significantly more difficult to fake than a form 990

This is one of the most exciting ideas I have heard of in a long time. Full MIT campus saturation. We should fundraise to do this at a bunch of schools.

@_date: 2014-03-19 09:38:47
Tell Dr.Marbut I said hi. And that peer review is the standard in research. 
I categorically disagree with everything you said in here. The concept that feeding the homeless is an enabling factor in homelessness is manufactured by municipalities to support their own unsustainable measures. 
We are the homeless resources. 
Those sorts of responses to dealing with hte homeless make some sense in a closed system. But we don't live in a vacuum. The idea of "stop attracting the homeless" to deal with homelessness is the same idea as blowing leaves into your neighbors yard and saying you cleaned up.
That's not dealing with homelessness.

That's definitively part of the solution. And we will implement something similar to that immediately. My biggest worry is people relying on that solely. It is trivial to make new addresses, transfer funds to them and tag the transfer saying it was paying for something.
What is much harder to fake, is social proof, which Sean's Outpost has done a great job of. The solution is probably some combination of the two.
Here's a blockchain transaction SAYING I paid for 200 meals, here's the photos of 200 meals and us passing them out.

Did you PM me about it? 
The thread you linked does not tag me and is in a post I did not write. 
In fact, I was made aware of that incident via PM. The issue was a mistake made by a web contractor when we swapped our site over. To my knowledge no harm was caused and it was corrected very quickly after the mistake was made.

Hi. This is Jason King from Sean's Outpost Homeless Outreach.  We are one of the largest cypto-currency based charities around. I would personally like to express to you how generous this community is. 
You made the comment that statistically speaking the number of people using bitcoin is zero. But the amount of wealth represented by that zero is statistically relevant. And I would wager that the propensity to donate is higher in our subset, making bitcoin a very powerful fundraising tool. Especially to an organization such as yours. 
But please don't take my word for it. Let us do what we do best. Let us prove to you what a great idea bitcoin is. Ask your board for a trial run.
If you don't see results,  move on. What's the harm? :)
Jason King

@_date: 2014-10-27 22:27:50
I agree. I think the whole non-profit industry is screwed. Incentives are misaligned and many people get into forming a non-profit for less than ideal reasons. Sean's Outpost is not that way. I (Jason King) derive no salary or monetary benefit from Sean's Outpost. In fact, the cost of running Sean's Outpost is more than the donations cover and the balance is paid by my wife and I.
We don't provide a few meals, we provide over 2,000 meals a week. Our meals are public and available for anyone to attend. And we operate and pay the mortgage on Satoshi Forest, a 9 acre homeless sanctuary.

Great! Where are you located? Also, it's not on the site yet, but the Renaissance is giving us $119 rooms for the event. That's more than $100 off list price. If you call the hotel and tell them you are going to the conference when you book they will give you the rate. 
The hotel is also REALLY nice. Don't know if you have ever been to a Renaissance before. They are Marriott's upscale brand.
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:58:09
So, when we had our first cleanup on Satoshi, we removed over two tons of debris that had been dumped on this blighted property. Among the haul were EIGHTEEN (18) broken crack pipes. 
In no uncertain terms, we have taken a blighted piece of waste property and turned it into a beautiful nature and homeless sanctuary. Ask it is simply beautiful.
I never actually thought I would hear someone say, out loud, "NOT IN BACK YARD". It's disturbing.

Thanks for posting this Roger, we had a pretty good push for them a few days ago. My 7 year old daughter Midgey is a type 1 diabetic. We learned about Jerry thru our juvenile diabetes support group. Such an awesome project. When a kid first gets diagnosed it's terrifying for them. Often going from never having had an injection they can remember to having 10+ a day.
Having a toy like Jerry the Bear to teach them and comfort them is such a great idea. 
And when my daughter saw they took bitcoin, her eyes lit up.
We donated and bought a bear. I hope a lot more people do too.

You're right.
I have not responded to some questions before. And maybe that was a mistake on my part. I'm not going to lie, you are a self proclaimed troll, and generally the best policy is not to feed trolls. But I have been lax in this case and should have done a better job of jumping out in front of it.
Also, just for the record, I LOVE that you are constantly critical. I think it is a needed form of balance in a community with a tendency to circle jerk. 
I did a detailed response here...
As to the QR code snafu, that was a web contractor who accidentally put up the wrong QR code during our site transition. The mistake was caught early and to my knowledge, no harm was done.

Yeah man. This has blind sided us. We actually pay every week to have code enforcement and the health department inspect Satoshi Forest.  They have yet to find a violation.  They have taken us to court twice and both times they were shot down. This is harassment.  We actually have the president of the county commission on video threatening to have the judge fired because she did not find us in violation.

Our feedings are public. We feed over 2,000 meals a week across 11+ diffrent meals. It is extremely easy to verify with anyone in Pensacola the depth of meals fed by Sean's Outpost. Faking that with as many people as can witness to our work would be a great deal harder than actually feeding people. So it's a diminishing returns thing. 
But I agree with Vitalik. Simple accounting with blockchain transactions alleviates the vast majority of problems.

So I posted because I actually thought with enough visibility the thief might realize who they stole from. Bitcoin charity is a small space  and I really do feel bad for fr33aid. 
The most important part of why I posted is to increase awareness for wallet security. That the convenience of some solutions allows us to make bad trade offs when it does come to security . And those tradeoffs have consequences. 
We all know to do better.  Sometimes we just don't. 
Erik Voorhees said he lost 550btc on gox. Because it was convenient to be there. You think Erik doesn't know a better solution?
Showing real world examples of this happening brings awareness.  I do not believe in security thru obscurity. 
That is why I posted. 
Well that and that fr33aid didn't have a reddit account until I forced them to make one today :)

Thanks fried_dough! All of the violations were actually mitigated before they issued this order to appear. They pretty much all resulted from us cleaning up all of the trash the neighbors have been dumping in the woods for years. We have cleaned it all up. It is stunningly beautiful now.
The only place where we have concern is over there assertion that people are not allowed to camp on our property. That is especially concerning because our zoning (c2) specifically permits, by name, campgrounds. Both primitive (no facilities) and group (facilities).
So if you can have a campground but can't camp I am very confused.
Our attorneys are all over this. It's political, not legal. They are going to go out of their way to make this difficult for us. But at the end of the day, what we are doing is legal, permitted, and on private property.
As would be stated in the "Ferengi Rules of Acquisition: Complaining and Boot Dragging, in a sack is worth the sack."
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:30:34
Also, to clarify, this title is fairly misleading. This hearing is literally called a "Quasi Judicial" hearing of Escambia County Code Enforcement. It is simply to discuss the counties concerns on implied code violations. That's it.  
This is not a court. They don't get to determine whether we get to continue operating.
As the county has already openly admitted, our land is zoned in a manner that SPECIFICALLY PERMITS campgrounds. The only concern is how difficult they want to make it to grant us the permit we are legally entitled to. 
Thank you to everyone who has supported us and made this possible. We knew a fight was coming, and it is thru the support of this amazing community that we gladly take whatever heat comes our way in providing the services that you have supported. 
From the bottom of my heart. And everyone here at Sean's Outpost, Thank you.

From behind the pay wall...
The Pensacola City Council on Thursday took the first step toward abolishing a controversial law that makes it a crime for the homeless to sleep with a blanket on city property, established a task force to seek more lasting solutions to the city’s homelessness epidemic and narrowly rejected a related attempt to roll back restrictions on tents and other temporary shelters.
The vote to repeal the so-called “blanket ban” was unanimous. However, the proposal still will have to pass a second reading, later this month, before becoming law.
The vote followed nearly an hour of impassioned comments from opponents of the ban. Members of the audience, including founders of internationally renowned homeless outreach Sean’s Outpost, told the council the law was inhumane, a violation of residents’ basic human rights and disastrous to the city’s reputation.
Before the vote, local civil rights attorney Alistair McKenzie — who spoke out against the project when it was passed into law last year — displayed a stack of news articles to council members. McKenzie said that the stated intent of the law’s architects — to protect the city’s image and aesthetics — had backfired.
“This is what Pensacola now looks like to the outside world,” he said.
McKenzie also reminded the council that the ban was only one in a series of restrictions placed on the city’s homeless population last year.
Along with the ban, the council enacted three other ordinances that made it illegal for homeless to wash or shave in public restrooms, relieve themselves on public property or ask for money.
“People still can’t wash their faces in public restrooms,” McKenzie said. “… I want to implore with you for your humanity, your Christianity, whatever sense of morals that you have, that you eliminate all of these ordinances.”
The council did not heed McKenzie’s request. However, Councilman Charles Bare, who voted against the ordinances last year, did move to also eliminate the city’s prohibition on tents and other temporary structures on public property.
“This ordinance is a cop-out,” Bare said of the bans. “… What this says is that we don’t have another solution (to homelessness), so we’re just going to make it illegal.”
Bare received a standing ovation for his motion, but the audience’s elation turned quickly to outrage when the motion failed.
A majority of councilmembers present, four out of seven, voted to support the proposal. Councilmembers P.C. Wu and Megan Pratt were absent, however, and five votes would have been needed for the motion to pass.
Following the vote, McKenzie had harsh words for those councilmembers who voted against Bare’s motion.
“I am ashamed of this council,” he said, “and I hope it costs you your jobs.”
Mike Kimberl, of Sean’s Outpost, promised councilmembers that the issue would not go away.
“We’re not gonna stop,” he said. “We’re gonna keep coming, and we’re also really, really good — as y’all have noticed — at making this world news.”

Well today, Sean's Outpost is going to feed hundreds of homeless people. And you are just trolling on reddit. Your questions have been answered you just keep rehashing the same thing over and over again because we didn't jump when you demanded us to take down old kudzu covered painted signs that represent the companies that have fallen to the wayside in bitcoin. We don't support BFL. In fact it was us asking the SEC what was to become of their charitable development fund that they never spent on charity. 
Our job is to help the homeless. Not to do political grandstanding at your whim. The comment you quoted earlier is referring to "the homeless" being criminals. Most of them have some type of record. Lot's of them are assholes. But that's not because they are homeless, it's because lots of PEOPLE are assholes.

Thanks Ben.
I'm going to try and type a response out quickly as I am getting ready to fly back to Pensacola.  I'm sure it will not be as through as you would like, but I will revisit at the end of the day.
First off, I don't think you're being a dick. I think anyone who has been as fortunate as I have with being able to generate this level of support for our cause needs to stand up to scrutiny.  Your tactics are sensational for sure, but link bate works! People will read the hell out of this.
Going to try and go in order...
Administrative dissolution:
This is a form and a fee to reinstate. Which has been paid and filed. There is no bar to clear in terms of getting back into good standing.  More so, I have deep reservations about being a registered charity.  I think that asking permission from anyone to do good is ridiculous.  Had we not purchased Satoshi Forest we would probably not have registered as an organization. Our organization would continue to feed the homeless no matter what our legal status. And correcting our status within the fiscal year alleviates any concerns as to our property ownership. 
The RV is titled in my name and is currently in Orlando, FL and has been serving as a base of operations for starting an outreach in Central Florida.  Similar to the recently publicized ft lauderdale laws, feeding the homeless is illegal in Orlando.  As to why the rv is titled in my name and not Sean's Outpost? The insurance cost of the vehicle being personally owned are dramatically less. It was the only fiscally feasible option. 
Cryptocurrency control has been mine. So any shortcomings on reportings are mine alone. Similarly,  Mike Kimberl has control over the bank account that coins are sold into.
From day 1 we have reported our cost of producing and delivering a meal at $1.25. We have currently fed over 130,000 meals to the homeless.  Which to my knowledge has never been in dispute. We are very public and frequent with our meals. That cost,  plus the publicly available lease and utilities information from the other post you quote, is greater than the USD value of all public donations(not from my wife and I) given to Sean's Outpost since inception. 
Can I give you an exact accounting off the top of my head. No. Is that ok? No. The main reason is we have always strived to do the most possible with the amount given. And we have done that in spades. As to my personal contributions, I have donated hundreds of BTC towards Sean's Outpost.  
I am not balling or hoarding and in truth would give up all I have and will have in service of the less fortunate.
I am all of those Jason Kings you have listed.  Serial entrepreneur and general asshole for most of my life. You left out my most spectacular fuck up. In 2011 I was an Associate on staff at TechStars Seattle and COMPLETELY FUCKED UP my relationship with that organization by having a very public very messy overdose from Methamphetamines and other drugs and all of the other related problems from being a piece of shit addict. Consequently that was my first brush with homelessness.  I live in the utility closet in the basement of techstars "the easy" for over a month.
I almost died. 
And that was rock bottom.  It took a few years, but I got my life back together.  And with a new outlook have dedicated my life to the service of the less fortunate 
In my previous response I outlined steps I thought Sean's Outpost and btc charities should start implementing to help transparency. And we are working on them now.
I still firmly believe that the best thing a charity can do is show the work it does. Which i think we have done well and publicly. 
And we will do much better in the future. 
Our works are public and verifiable and outnumber the value of donations given. 
Our current bitcoin holdings are 2.1btc and most of that is about to pay the mortgage on Satoshi Forest. 
The QR code snafu was an accident caused by Lisa Cheng who was kind enough to donate the website Overhaul for us. She corrected it immediately after notifying. I have left her name out of previous comments because i didn't think it was a big deal and was rectified quickly. 
I'm sure i left out a lot and or caused more questions.  Im getting on a plane so it will be a few hours.

I think you are being callous and insensitive,  but I also agree with the spirit of what you are saying.
Security is everyone's responsibility. And things like this are great reminders how no one is immune from this. If we want to be our own bank we have to treat it like a vault. And fyi fr33aid is pretty much run entirely by women. And while I think they are all sex positive,  I take issue with "jacking off" on technical grounds.

Yeah, and if you don't feed them they die of starvation. Come on man, they're people, not stray dogs. I understand the sentiment, and Sean's Outpost is very much on the "Teach a man to fish." tip. But here's the truth, if you haven't eaten in a week, and I try to teach you to fish you won't learn shit.
We're triage. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:44:45
In fact, I receive no salary or monetary compensation. The cost of running Sean's Outpost is greater than the amount donated and the extra required to pay for everything is paid by my wife and I.
The only board member who draws a salary is Michael Kimberl. YTD, he has been compensated $21,500 which is extremely low both for the area and the field of work.
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:00:13
Yeah, our site is terrible. That's all me. It's a hatchet job word press installation. The reason it's not better is simple. We have concentrated specifically on the work we do and not showcasing the work we do. At the end of the day if people are warm and fed, I really don't care who gets credit for it. And having enough donations has never been a problem for us (knock on wood)
That being said. You will get your wish. A really awesome designer is working on overhauling the whole thing. Taking it on himself, so that we don't have to lose focus.
@_date: 2014-10-15 18:54:43
Having the inventory and shipping the inventory are too completely different tasks. They are a very small team. I have seen the pictures of Kyle's living room packed to the ceiling with ATM's. Testing, packing, crating, labeling and shipping all physically take time. There's only going to be so many they can ship a day with limited manpower. My guess is 3 weeks is giving space for their current S+H obligations. The skyhook is DIRT cheap. Works REALLY well. Kyle has set it up at my booth on three different occasions. But with that price point comes the tradeoff of not having a large staff and hitting a physical limitation on the number of units you can ship a day. Just my two cents.

Sean's Outpost doesn't attempt to be a 501c3. The 501c3 status enables donations given for tax exempt purposes to be tax deductible for the donor. You can still engage in tax exempt activities without that status. Sean's Outpost is a registered non-profit in the State of Florida. And we currently engage in all tax exempt activities, but after much counsel and debate have descided that 501c3 status does not meet our needs as a humanitarian organization. 
However, we are VERY excited for BitGive. Connie and her team are extraordinary people. In fact, on their "become a founding donor" page, that's me at the right in the picture with their team. Sean's Outpost is extremely supportive of the bitgive mission and hope this new tax status boosts their fundraising efforts.

So two points,  one Satoshi Forest is zoned commercial. Always has been. We were never asking for a zoning variance as the property was always zoned properly for a campground. 
And second,  the county actually argued that it was illegal to be homeless.  So we were aiding and abetting criminals. This is actually an argument used all over Florida that had never been challenged. We challenged it. In the judges ruling she stated that being homeless in the state of Florida was in fact not illegal. That ruling was just upheld on appeal. Making it citable case law for the State. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 09:26:53
I, for one, think allowing this discussion in a few threads would be very beneficial to both sides. This conversation right here is one of the most cognizant, non political discussions of the facts I have seen. I don't see why we couldn't publicizea discussion, like this one, and state from jump that any mud slinging or trolling in that thread would be modded to oblivion. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:40:02
I don't understand/agree with why we can't talk about this like adults. I am not qualified to make a judgement on whether or not XT is the way to go. But at this point, it seems obvious blocksize has to go up. I'm not sure why we can't openly discuss all options. Open discussion would seem to be in the spirit of what Satoshi wanted.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:46:16
The comparison isn't really that simple. The problem above was they were talking about replacing the Magistrate DURING the proceedings,  because it seemed she might be sympathetic. Yes, I would absolutely be opposed to changing judges midway for any reason.

I'm calling you a troll because you are a troll. Which you have openly admitted to and have said you are proud of. I don't care whether you are actively trolling here or not. 
That open letter was not posted here. It was RE-POSTED here from Let's Talk Bitcoin. There's also a formal response from me posted in the same medium that it was initially asked, ON Let's Talk Bitcoin. That was also reposted here. But you have no interest in posting any of that. Just shrink the lens to whatever portion you want people to see.
I seriously couldn't care less. Tare me apart. Question everything. It's a good plan, I do it myself. The fact is, in the months since that open letter came out, what we have done is fed another 25,000 meals to the homeless.
No one has to donate to us. No one ever has. 
We are the largest provider of meals to the homeless in our county. A fact that no one has even tried to contradict. 
What anyone thinks of me personally, is there business. We are significantly more efficient, and effective at what we do than anyone else in our area. If someone can do it better, that would be amazing. Please come help. 
Meanwhile, there are almost 200,000 more homeless in the US this year than last year. And it's just getting worse. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 02:59:54
Yeah, haven't been posting on here. We've just been focusing on running our organization.  We celebrated our two year anniversary on March 17th and handed out our 150,000th meal the week before. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 04:04:22
It's up for sale if you would like to purchase it. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 03:07:21
Yeah, pretty much no part of what you have said here is true, other than we stopped posting in r/bitcoin.  It just isn't the same as it use to be, although I have seen a much higher quality of content and comment in the last month or so. 
We actively post on pretty much all social media. 
We lost no "certification" to be a charity. What the hell would that even mean?
And the insurance bus thing is just completely ridiculous. The bus is titled in my name, and was given to me from KryptoKit. It is insured in my name, because it is titled in my name. My insurance company was well aware of exactly how it was being used for advertising of Bitcoin Across America and it was insured as such.
But seriously, carry on. We'll be over here feeding 150,000 meals to the homeless.

And the answer to your question is yes. The $1.25 price point is the average cost per meal when factoring in all costs of production and delivery.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:32:01
I would be happy to. We are a registered non-profit. We have applied for 501c3 status, but it will probably be a year before the determination is made. However, as long as the determination is made within the next 24 months your donation now will still be tax deductible. PM me for more details on putting this together.

We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle.

There are definitely real charity bitcoin options. We are a homeless outreach fueled entirely by crypto-currency. 22,000+ meals this year to date paid for with Bitcoin.
khanacademy.com takes donations in Bitcoin to
BitGive is a charitable foundation holding an endowment in Bitcoin to use for humanitarian efforts in the future when the value is even higher. 
fr33aid takes bitcoin and they provide free medical care 
The FreeState Project takes bitcoin
BitcoinNotBombs raises awareness for bitcoin non-profits and is a fellow helper of the homeless
and Bitcoin100.org is the original bitcoin philanthropy, they spend all their donations getting fiat charities to take bitcoin.
So there are options :)

You are such a fantastic part of this community. I am humbled at your generosity. Thank you so much for everything man. 
And thank you to everyone that has helped make Sean's Outpost a reality. Greg can now attest, we are truly making a difference in one part of the world.
And we are PROUDLY Powered by Bitcoin.

That would be really, really awesome. Just yesterday, we found a girl who became incapacitated in a very remote area. Had we not gone out to check on her, she easily could have died. 
Having something we all take for granted, a damn cellphone, really could have saved her life.  
If you guys can work this out. It would be amazing.

We ended up paying December off. Thanks for all you have done for us. It is really humbling. Here's the breakdown of what we are doing...
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle.

You kick much ass. Thank you
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:58:54


You left out a big part of that one. 


I don't think you are a troll at all. I just think we have a complete difference of opinion here. Which is cool. It's what makes this place great is that we can all have differences of opinion. There is no judgement on your views, I'm just stating my findings, from my knowledge base and asserting the beliefs I pull from that. 
You said I was Naive about how benefits I provide, can be used. I submit that I'm not, I just think, even from an efficiency standpoint, that erring on the side of trusting someone to take care of there immediate needs on the street is going to be a better use of resources then not giving a resource on the corner case that it might be abused. 
And, as I have already pointed out. In every case, i would much rather directly provide the need (food, clothing, tampons) then provide cash for acquiring that need. But in the example I gave that started this whole thing...
- I was no where near that person
- I trust them based on prior experience of knowing them and they personally helping me out.
- Bitcoin allowed me to IMMEDIATELY provide a solution to them eating. No matter where I would have happened to be in the world.
It's not, Bitcoin feeds the world pizza down here in Pensacola. It's Bitcoin can effect help in situations where cash couldn't. At least not as effectively and efficiently.
The CEO of Habitat for Humanity makes $247,000 a year
Their VP in Asia makes $311,000
Most "Structured" charities are the same way. It's really sad. Maybe you didn't know that, but the "Legit" charities are all about fundraising, just not all about passing that through to effect help. The largest Homeless Outreach here in Pensacola's CEO makes $250,000 a year.
If you are really interested in trimming the fat in providing effectiveness from your charitable dollar, I guarantee you get more bang for your buck down here. Even if 1 in 10 people I help manipulate that help into a 40oz.


Maybe that's what you meant. But that is not what you said. This entire conversation stemmed from you asking why I didn't just use the gyft app to buy them pizza. Instead of letting them buy it for themselves. Empty Papa Johns boxes is a pretty good indication that Papa johns was purchased. All of the other conjecture about an after market for pizza slices is COMPLETELY different from the original point you made.

If a cop views that transaction, they are going to take that person to jail. Even if they continue to the otherside.
It's really an ordinance written like it's an obfuscated C contest. The point is to arrest panhandlers.But they think saying being homeless and asking for money is illegal makes them sound bad. So they find ways to prosecute the physical act without saying they are penalizing you for being homeless.
In related news, awesome homeless people have started using nets on poles. Its a giant fuck you to the cops and makes me lol

I think we all have the capacity to be complete assbags. And I think the default setting on being human is "selfish". The thing is to hack that. Learn that we don't have to be. It's a lifelong process. I'm better than I was, but still have lots of room for improvement.

It's not up yet, but it will all be up. I was working at the Foundation Booth when the video guy came by to talk about it. Basically, all the footage has to be recieved from the video team, then it will all be edited and put on line. To my understanding editing will just consist of merging  footage with the presentation materials (power point, prezi, etc) so that people watching at home can see what people in the room saw. I don't think there was a deadline talked about, but the tone of the conversation was one of getting it done quickly.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:11:11
Yeah, you will probably be more into the organic farm we are building in Satoshi Forest. 
It's a balancing act, we do the best we can with what we have. And we have actually substantially upgraded the meal since march. It's really of zero value to hold out on better food if the person you are trying to help is going to die of starvation in the mean time.

Generally, it's the empty papa johns boxes that litter their bench that give it away. Not a lot of liquor stores taking bitcoins just yet. And I would actually be impressed if they could schedule a Silk Road delivery to the middle of a public park.
A lot of these guys stay on the street because they have no hope. That stems from the feeling that they think they have no value. Trusting someone, even just a little bit, is a huge panacea. It goes a long way towards developing self worth.
"Dont spend this money on booze, hobo" does more damage to the human psyche then you can possibly imagine

Sean's Outpost has one right now. Approach an individual seller about "owner financing" and paying your downpayment and mortgage payments in BTC. It is a buyers market right now in most places and a LOT of property owners are very flexible right now. It can't hurt to ask.

You would be surprised. There is definitely a portion that have chosen to be on the street because the pressures put on them by society are too much for them to bare. What alternative they would have is another question.
How do we help people get on their feet? Well, we don't have real data for this yet. We haven't been doing it long enough. But the idea is, treat them like people, care about them, and if they want to get off the street try to provide them a path to get back up. Like work building houses for other homeless or farming to feed others. 
We will see how it goes. Will definitely keep everyone in the loop. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 22:47:05

I think you have made it pretty clear what the infraction was. And I think Fawkesy would have been very eager to comply with any correction she would have been given. I know it's walking a line with Modding, but she really is a great part of the Bitcoin community. 
And the Bitcoin community is OVERWHELMINGLY not angered by her actions. We all make mistakes. And she seems so happy to make changes. You have said she lost trust, but I don't think that's really true within the community she supports. 
The beauty of bitcoin, is we can physically see how much she has benefited. I can tell you, and you can look up for yourself, she has personally donated many multiples of that amount to my homeless outreach. 
Beyond that, she led a fundraising campaign that helped raise funds to feed HUNDREDS of homeless in Northwest Florida. Fawkesy is a hero. Maybe not in any ones traditional sense of the word. But she really is. And she is passionate about the crypto currency community, and well respected.
I think many neutral parties have offered to mod. I think that would be the way to go, if my opinion is worth anything. 
We can all be better. We are all a work in progress. You guys really could give GGB a second chance. Keep a close eye on it. I don't think they will let you down.
My two cents. i understand it's a complex issue. 
thanks for taking the time to talk openly about it. That's why we all love Reddit.

How I imagine this going down...
For our purposes the part of Dr. Egon Spangler will be played by Patrick Murck (Bitcoin Foundation General Council), Dr. Peter Venkman will be played by Peter Vessenes, Janine Melnitz will be played by Lindsay Holland, Walter Peck will be played by Commissioner Teveia Barnes, and the part of the Ghost Containment unit will be played by BITCOIN.
Picture, if you will, the basement of the ghostbusters firehouse as EPA civil servent Walter Peck storms in with his court order and police escort demanding Dr. Peter Venkman shut down the ghost containment unit.
Janine Melnitz: Egon, I tried to stop them they say they have a Cease and Desist order. 
Dr. Egon Spengler: Excuse me, we're a nonprofit trade organization. 
Walter Peck: [after observing bitcoin] Shut this off, shut these all off. 
Dr. Egon Spengler: I'm warning you. Turning this off is completely impossible. TRYING to turn off these machines will be extremely hazardous. 
Walter Peck: No, I'm telling "you" what's hazardous, you have about a half dozen archaic, irrelevant, poorly interpreted  banking and money transmission violations here. Now either you shut off BITCOIN, or we'll shut it off for you. 
Dr. Egon Spengler: Try to imagine, this a high voltage, distributed, trustless, deflationary currency system.  Trying to turn it off will be like dropping a bomb on the archaic monetary system you are trying to protect.
Walter Peck: Don't patronize me, I'm not protestly stupid, like the people you've helped. 
Dr. Peter Venkman: [to the officer] Excuse me officer, I don't know why that man is here but I will co-operate with him in any way that I can.
Walter Peck: Forget it, Venkman(Vessenes). You had your chance to co-opperate, but you though it would be more fun to insult me. Now, it's my turn, wiseass. 
Dr. Egon Spengler: He wants to shut down Bitcoin, Peter. 
Dr. Peter Venkman: [to Walter Peck] You try an shut that thing down, and "we" are not gonna be held responsible for what ever happens. 
Walter Peck: Oh yes you will, I'll make sure you will. 
Dr. Peter Venkman: No, we won't be. 
Walter Peck: [to California Legal System] Shut it off. 
Dr. Peter Venkman: [to California Legal System] Don't shut it off. I'm warning ya. 
California Legal System: I, I never seen anything like this before. I'm not sure... 
Walter Peck: [Interrupting] I'm not interested in your opinion, just shut it off. 
Dr. Peter Venkman: [Gets in California Legal System's way] My friend, don't be a jerk. 
Police Sergeant: [Gets in Peter's way] Step aside. 
Walter Peck: If he does that again, you can shoot him. 
Police Sergeant: You do 'your" job, pencilneck. Don't tell me how to do mine. 
Dr. Peter Venkman: Thank you, officer. 
Walter Peck: [aggravatingly shouting] Shut it down! SHUT BITCOIN DOWN!!!

@_date: 2013-12-15 17:46:58
and i really appreciate you thinking about us
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:12:38
It kind of sneaks up on you. We tallied up all we have done since March and we are at 12,996 meals fed. We are helping with a sharing at 4pm CST. The usual turn out for that meal is 30 or 40. So somewhere in this pot of Kale and Corn chowder is the 13,000th meal.
It's really, really damn good chowder too. We actually take crap from haters for feeding people too high quality of food.
Haters gonna hate.
Thank you all so much. I'm actually crying a bit. I will try not to get any in the chowder.
From the bottom of my heart. Thank you all.

You know, I retyped that word like 5 times, because it looked odd to be. Thank you for nailing my trepidation on the head. Yes, this is a much better FED for BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:40:29
Matty!!!! You know I have much love for you. Thans for all the hard work and makingthis community special. Can't wait to meet you in person in 2014.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:18:22
Good to hear from you man. Stop by anytime.
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:40:37
hell yeah
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:54:54
Will do!
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:44:01
Thanks so much! Every little bit helps. $5 is still an extra 4 meals.
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:32:28
HELL YEAH!
@_date: 2013-06-25 17:02:10
Its cool. Also, most people dont know the government will buy you a phone and give you service if you are really poor. It doubles as a trackinf device
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:40:05
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:29:19
That is awesome. Thank you so much
@_date: 2013-10-08 02:28:24
Well, we do build very small houses...
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:58:07
You are awesome!!!

All out direct donation info is at...
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:00:04
Damn man!!! That's awesome. Thank you so much. YOU ROCK. I will update the list right now.
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:50:04
Same area of town. But not in Satoshi. It is a long time homeless encampment known as Turtle Creek. It's prized territory for the homeless because it's on state property and the state has very little resources to police it and the county has no authority from the state to evict them. 
This would have been a VERY different scenario had they done this in Satoshi Forest on Sean's Outpost Private Property. 
To quote the great poet and philosopher Young Jeezy...
"Fuck with mine."
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:52:25
Awesome! Thank you

If you meant the coinsetter cookie jar...that was me too

Come on down! We will be happy to feed you
@_date: 2013-09-09 17:37:13
Yep. Has to be. It's the first thing they would come attack us for.
@_date: 2013-07-04 00:38:11
Hell yeah man. That's fantastic.
I've slung screens for years. If you get stuck on anything,,let me know
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:54:38
I assume it was a couple of trolls
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:48:22
No, that is awesome! 
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:25:58
Yeah, I quoted that in my response. Such a great talk. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 22:51:44
You know, it's totally ok. It keeps Sean's memory fresh. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:10:59
DO WANT! 
@_date: 2013-08-29 18:18:41
Can you add some context? What about being homeless precludes you from using Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-21 02:37:40
We are just getting started, but yes we have 9 acres in florida that is a homeless sanctuary and permaculture forest
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:20:49
We have a donor matching all donations up to 10BTC total. I hope everyone has a great 
@_date: 2013-09-09 13:24:33
Yes, and for the record, hardleft121 holds the distinction of being the first person to send a Bitcoin transaction from inside the forest. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:31:36
Nah, man. This was Alfred Jazeera. Sorry
@_date: 2013-10-11 19:20:12
i do so little and the dark is so big. We really could use some more lights. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 12:54:22
These guys are legit. Some of the most forward thinking minds in the blockchain. Great minds, proven coders.
Very excited by the possibilities here.
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:22:24
That is hella awesome
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:56:48
Yeah, he was my best friend. It was really hard. 
It's a privilege to run the outpost in his his honor. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:54:03
You kick ass
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:20:31
Well, are sack lunches have always had a sandwich in them. But we do 5 days a week of sack lunch delivery and we also provide 4 hot meals a week as well.

Wow. That's a great article. Thank you so much
@_date: 2013-10-16 22:17:14
Thanks for coming by man. I always love seeing you're kind, caring, and constructive words. I don't ever feel like a post has been effective unless you show up. Keep up the good work man!
@_date: 2013-09-09 16:05:10
Wow right back at you. Arigatō waller-son. I am humbled by your generosity. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:28:29
Hey man. I think there is value to what you are talking about. We have had people express interest in doing something like this. At this juncture, Im hesitant, because it involves taking video equipment into these peoples camps and a large part of me feels like that's exploitive. Even if it is for a good cause. Lots of these people are terrified. For instance of all the people who's blankets were stolen ZERO of them would step forward as a complaining witness. These people have been marginalize into near existence. Maybe in a few months, when we have some better infrastructure, more trust, and a fully functioning Satoshi Forest.
Thanks for the idea and the support. 
@_date: 2013-09-09 16:08:28
Thanks for the love. It's not just me though. We have a solid 4 people doing this full time now, and a lot of other people who make it possible. I'm just the most vocal :)
@_date: 2013-10-10 17:13:57
Lol. Come on down, we have no ID requirements. You just have to behave yourself. And it would be cool if you could shoot us an email from a burner account so we can get a fairly accurate estimated headcount.

Music to crime by...
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:31:18
Right. Except ultimately, we need people to spend. Doctors visits are at the right price point here. And I know a lot of people who are uninsured. If they just had to part with a third of a coin right now and they needed to go to the dr, they might go. The doctor doesn't have to hold the coin. He could convert. Which is easy. But educated non-tech people like dr's knowing a lot more about Bitcoin can't be bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:13:45

Maybe making sweeping generalizations about "illuminating" everything is foolish. We feed people that to this day are still very uncomfortable about the fact that we know where they live. I deal with these people everyday and am very intune to their anxieties and very respectful of their wishes. Trying to make a Sean's Outpost TV show would offend most of the people we help. I know that because I actually know them.
@_date: 2013-10-13 20:19:19
And like he said on the air, he actually did donate 1BTC to us. Good guys. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:22:02
that's why is awesome we can have our own opinions.
@_date: 2013-09-09 14:52:32
They are custom built from the ground up. It gives us the chance to show people exactly what goes into building a house. It also gives us the most flexibility in design. 
One of our first projects will be building a wireless mesh net across the forest. We already started building compost bins. The clippings from clearing the land will all go towards it. 
As to grey water, we haven't thought of cisterns yet, but we do have a creek that runs thru we plan on tapping for irrigation
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:49:50
WOW. Thank you so much, that's amazing.
@_date: 2013-07-31 01:38:43
Yeah, I would have to disagree. At least from my own experience, bitcoiners have been extremely generous
@_date: 2013-09-09 18:48:07
I look forward to it
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:18:12
Yeah, I wanted that to be legit
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:27:38
Much love man. Thank you
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:53:06
And Slim Jims. Don't forget us selling out to buy salted meat snacks. That's important.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:19:05
Want to donate one to auction off to feed the homeless? Just make sure I can test drive it ALOT first. Lol
No really, this is great guys. Very forward thinking.
@_date: 2013-10-08 17:10:19
Silk Road 2.0 should be called Patagonia. There should be no argument on this.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:16:24
Thanks for the love!
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:45:34
That's actually the purpose of what we are doing. Give people the opportunity to build or farm, if they want to work.
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:53:01
I love the sentiment. Unfortunately, with how we are treated down here, that would end in a swat raid.
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:23:37
Witcoins! You're back, hell yeah.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:13:23
It is cool that the outpost Coinbase account just randomly goes up now :)
@_date: 2013-08-29 22:29:25
I run a homeless outreach in Pensacola, FL that is primarily funded thru Bitcoin donations. We explain what Bitcoin is to all we serve. A few of the more industrious ones have gotten wallets on their phones and laptops and have started doing odd jobs online for bitcoin as well as accepting bitcoin donations. They can use there BTC to eat via gyft.com
@_date: 2013-10-10 00:50:49
That's really generous of you. Thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:04:30
It's the thought that counts :-)
@_date: 2013-09-09 16:06:46
You are more than welcome to cross post this :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:36:03
Hell yeah. Thank you so much PeachesOrPears. These will be much appreciated. You are awesome!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:32:05
Dude is giving up the whole amount. That hater should read more
@_date: 2013-06-25 16:57:06
Thanks man
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:43:29
Yeah, we're not trying to become a homeless resort town.
@_date: 2013-09-05 22:21:15

Im like 280, 6'3. I will totally do this competition with you, we can even do a weighted scale where I have to lose proportionatly more weight then you if you want. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 18:09:35
This stuff is absolutely amazing. Wholly Hemp was nice enough to send us a bunch for us to use in the field here at the Outpost. This stuff woks GREAT. And this is in the August Florida Sun...so you know it works. 
I'm not really much for product endorsement, but this stuff is really good quality. So I will make an exception :)
@_date: 2013-10-12 16:48:51
Wow talk about terrible placement for spam.
@_date: 2013-10-02 14:14:48
Lol. Yeah, the graph is lame. I think the article is interesting though. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:03:29
That's awesome, I would love to come see your shop. I use to run a a DTG /Embroidery shop here in Pensacola. I love those damn things. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:28:28
Man, that's such an awesome statement. Thank you so much. You really do make a difference. Thank you a million times
@_date: 2013-08-09 16:12:42
Lol. Ok, start with reading my past posts on Reddit. Then google Jason King Bitcoin. Then type in Jason King Bitcoin on YouTube. Im the guy i. The beard.

Aww schucks. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-09-10 01:27:39
It's all good. Thanks man. Sean would have dug what you do too.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:56:10
Of course dollars feed people. The point is even though we had a big dip today Bitcoin is still valuable.
@_date: 2013-10-29 18:53:13
Thanks to everyone who came out. It was a lot of fun. Can't wait to do it again!
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:27:57
Our powers combined... 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:48:49
Its actually quite riveting
@_date: 2013-06-25 02:51:21
Feel free to come to Pensacola. I will gladly introduce you to Jessie, Chris, and Paul at Martin Luther King Park here. 
What exactly are you skeptical of? We're pretty highly vetted as a charity. 
I was walking out of Target tonight, on the North side of Pensacola, and was texted by a homeless individual in down town. Who, coincidentally we were not able to find  when we delivered lunches today. He said he was hungry, and asked for bitcoins, to buy pizza via the GYFT app from Papa Johns. Which they have done in the past. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 03:19:08
It's not there yet. At all. But we're working on it. This set of guys all have Androids, and are all pretty techno savvy. But most don't have smartphones. That's why we've been working on a SMS based wallet. 
But you're right, the majority of meals we feed homeless we pay for using proceeds received in Bitcoin and we bring the food to them. 
This screenshot was just a very unique, organic example of how bitcoin can help in this field. And it just happened to me tonight. 
Be happy to interview Jessie in the AM for you and get a screenshot of his wallet. 
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:39:32
Thanks man!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:46:39
I appreciate you saying that. A lot of people are just scared right now. I get it. But the usefulness stays the same. It should all even out
@_date: 2013-06-25 17:17:33
Yep. There is a federally subsidized cell phone plan
@_date: 2013-08-09 18:15:25

@_date: 2013-09-12 13:32:04
Thanks for taking the time out of your day to give us some input. We actually talked about just this scenario. Ultimately, after talking with counsel, it was determined that paying off our debt responsibilities within the calendar year we're currently in is probably the most responsible thing for us to do in terms of our responsibilities as a charity.
That being said. Now that we are paid up thru the end of 2014, we will be breaking down tips for the rest of the year like this...
50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle. 
Hope you're having a good week. Thank you for all the work you do in making Bitcoin awesome. It's really inspiring, keep up the good work!

Of course man. We try to treat everyone with respect and compassion. Sometimes it is all someone needs.
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:44:01
You are welcome. It's not hard. Go to your cupboard, make a sandwhich, give it to a homeless person. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:16:11
I like where your head is at. BTCT.co just shut fown, so we will probably need to go Havelock. My wife also pointed out that MULTIPLE FAWKSEY rigs will probably have a problem with blowing the cpu/mine of the operator :)
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:45:55
It's too big to be a space station...
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:18:30

@_date: 2013-12-26 15:09:53
@_date: 2013-09-20 21:19:02
I know lots, and lots of homeless with laptops. I know two with hotplates. Granted that the laptops are years old and probably not usable my most of our standards, but they have them. I think society has morphed. Being able to connect online is becoming much more a requirement. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:29:18
Now we need to get a bunch of these and go bitmob somewhere...
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:16:38
Just trying to do a little bit. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:12:30
Yeah, adoption actually has to increase a whole lot. So when we do the full year comparison I expect the amount of meals to engulf my kitchen and spill out into the neighboring rooms. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:26:45
I can hook you up if you want. .1 btc includes shipping
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:58:43
That's awesome. What machine do you guys run?
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:46:43
We have really kick ass counsel. Like, really, really good and really connected in this part of Florida. I agree, it's not an if but a when.
@_date: 2013-09-09 19:04:32
Thank you so much
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:27:55

@_date: 2013-04-10 23:03:34
It's true. Because it is still a useful store of value.
@_date: 2013-08-02 04:51:36
Go to your fridge, make a sandwich, wrapp it up, go give it to the first homeless and/or down trodden person you meet. Tell that person that they have value, listen to whst they have to say and tell them to stay safe when you leave. Rinse and repeat
@_date: 2013-08-21 01:58:43
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:42:30
Thank you for your kind words. They mean a lot. I feel what I do deserves no praise. I love doing it. And it feels like everyone should be able to reach out and help another human. It's really easy. Just help :)
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:40:25
Master of the house I am not, but keeper of the zoo is probably debatable
@_date: 2013-08-05 23:00:55
Yeah, it would be really great. 
I am a little disappointed he wont slip me a developer unit for some coins right now though :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:56:02
Thank you so much. I will put it to good use.
@_date: 2013-09-24 18:22:36
Man, I really appreciate the love. But I am not IAMA worth. Seriously.
@_date: 2013-09-24 18:00:04
Stop that. We should be hailing hardleft121

I don't have a church. I myself am a heathen. 
But some of the volunteers there today were and it was very interesting explaining bitcoin to a crowd of 60+ .
FYI, they thought it was really cool
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:27:46
Because it mentions Android and Blackberry?
 I meant I think we will find out everyone was as complicit in this as apple. It's just more sensational to try to shame apple singularly. 
I promise this is not the end of the info
@_date: 2013-08-01 19:12:42
Seriously, if you want to start a revolution, don't pick up a gun, pick up a soup ladle. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 13:26:01
Thank you so much
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:44:56
I think this is natural, and this is life. None of us are one thing. We are an individual mix of darks and lights. We all have the capacity to be good and evil at anytime (not saying gambling is evil). At any moment, we can stop and make a choice that we are going to try and make something better. And that choice is completely separated from anything else you have ever done before it. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:08:56
Thanks for the vote of goodwill!
I'm Jason, btw. The Outpost is named after Sean Dugas, my best friend who was murdered in 2012. we run the outpost in his memory.
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:09:13
Absolutely. Freshly mined "virgin" coins that have never been used for anything fetch a premium over normal coins.

@_date: 2013-11-28 14:50:39
Much love man. That's awesome. Yeah, you gotta give that bot a break. It works so hard! Happy Thanksgiving
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:36:11
Our lawyer is on it. We just have a very corrupt legal system down here.
They don't site codes. They just follow orders. Cops don't tell you what law you are breaking just that you are under arrest. They figure out what to book you for later. Or they just book you for resisting. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:27:17
Hells yeah. BITCOIN CHEESEY PUFF MANIA!!!!!

@_date: 2013-04-04 21:45:55
That's why I said let's discuss how we can. Obviously one clinic is not changing the system. But there are ways Bitcoin COULD. Making cash like transaction so much more attractive that people would prefer to pay that way could be one. I know several people who's insurance premium far outweighs the actual cost of care year over year.
There are a lot of things that could possibly happen. And yes, it is a huge mountain to climb.  I would just like to hear people discuss options.

We did just that!!!!
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle.

Yes. It's about $1.25 a bag. And a lot of the cost of the meals is actually in fuel. Pensacola is spread out, delivery costs suck. I think I did the breakdown of the meal in my initial post, which should be somewhere down the page on SeansOutpost.com. Really gotta get our site in better order :/

@_date: 2013-04-04 19:32:41
Currently, I see a few. One, this is a new source of liquidity that hasn't been utilized for Doctor's before. Up to this point, Bitcoin users have been pretty loyal to businesses that accept BTC. Plus, any new business accepting Bitcoin is going to increase the utility of Bitcoin as a whole. Making Bitcoin more stable, and (don't hate me) driving the price up. If I paid you $15 in February, it would still be $15. If I paid you 1BTC it would be $134ish. 
I know it's pie in the sky, but people talk about valuations for Bitcoin going absolutely insane. If that's true, making moves RIGHT NOW to disrupt the health care industry, leveraging Bitcoin, could be a huge winner in the future
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:20:21
This is fantastic. I am so happy to see you guys doing this. Thank you for what you do. The setup looks good. I think that is fine. I would suggest contacting bitcoin100.org they will probably be willing to get you started with $1,000 in bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-26 04:06:35
Hey, thank you so much for your support. But that comment was me being flippent. No one has ever said that money should go to us. I thought that was obvious but apparently I need to be more careful in my jokes.
I said that out of a frustration with those donated funds sitting, not being used for what they were pledged for. It is not fair to those who gave in good faith. 
We try to be the opposite of that.
But that money is not ours. I am truly sorry for any confusion. It was not my intent.

Wish I was joking. It is a joke of a law, but the law in these parts none the less
@_date: 2013-08-29 20:24:52
In the area that these guys live in panhandling is illegal. Bitcoin is literally routing around damage for these guys
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:09:16
That I am. 
I think it's the technology and protocol that will be the game changer. For instance I realize this is still a long way out, but...
Here in Pensacola, it is illegal to step off the curb into the road for any purpose besides to cross the road. This is an ordinance designed specifically to prosecute homeless people for stepping into the road to accept money people are trying to give them. If BTC were more wide spread the homeless guy could hold up a QR code or address and someone could snap a picture and pay him without the need for him walking into the road. 
Yes, that's a pigeon holed example but it would fix a real problem here. Average panhandler daily intake $32. Average cost to book a panhandler  into the court system $3,600. You do the math. This would save everyone money and keep people out of jail.
Ok. Off my soap box. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:38:31

I wrote this above too.
Yeah, I'm not exactly PC.
 Jessie is a good friend, and is very common good friends give each other shit. If it helps the text that is just off the screen after "stay safe" is him saying "You are a king among fat men". 
A lot of the guys we feed are actually my friends. I care about them on a basic human level and we talk about so much more then them being hungry. I think being able to "give someone shit" is one of the key defining factors of a real friendship.
@_date: 2013-09-11 13:02:40
Yeah, we were looking at these...
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:58:41
That is very generous. Thank you so much.
Currently, we mostly do feeding and clothing. Like the other day, I was under the bay bridge and met a homeless marine vet with no socks or pants. I got him socks and pants.
We have also helped cover prescriptions for when they get sick or injured and cant cover the cost of tbe meds. I have actually been really suprised at how awesome the pharmacies have been. Coming up with discounts or pointing me to a cheaper pharmacy for certain drugs. 
We are working on a housing and job placement situation. Hope to have good news on that soon.
Also, we are plugged into the other resources in town and drive people to them for othet issues

I was working at tbe Bitcoin foundation booth for a good portion of Bitcoin2013. It just so happened to be parked right next to the BitcoinStore booth.
I just have to say it. These guys are fucking awesome.  Really smart, really solid grasp on what they are doing.
I talked to them about site organization. It's totally on their radar. They just had to get a crapload of unorganized data into some assemblage of uniformity. It really did seem like a clusterfuck of a task. It will only get better from here.

This guy is the real deal.
We talked on the phone yesterday and I'm telling you this is a good guy. 
Here's the deal, he pledged everything over 2.2 Bitcoins to Sean's Outpost. Then after that pledge another 22+ coins came in. Instead of being like "I gotz mine" he went out of his way to prove he was a man of his word. What we came up with is this...
1. He sent half the coins, 11BTC, to us as a show of good faith. 
2. He is figuring out tax implications of his windfall
3. Once tax is figured out, and he has tithed to his church, the balance of the coins will be transmitted to Sean's Outpost.
4. Regardless of who holds the coins, those coins will be used to start an endowment fund for Sean's Outpost and those coins will not be spent for AT LEAST one year.
5. All this is awesome 
Thanks man. Stand up guys are rare. We need more of you in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-01 22:07:02

So, I want to give some context to this.
Bruno, is the founder of Bitcoin100.org, an AMAZING Bitcoin meta charity. This is like the grandfather of the bitcoin charity movement. Of his own accord, he planned this whole dinner and raised all the money for it. 
With NO prompting. He's just that kind of guy.
And now that it's all paid for, all he wants is to be able to promote some bitcoin businesses while we are out there. He is really that awesome. 
Hive has already stepped up as a sponsor, we want 9 more. Who's in?
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:28:43

I feed the homeless with them. We're at around 17,000 meals to date with most of the meals purchased thru bitcoin donations. We also bought a 9 acre homeless sanctuary with them that we pay the mortgage on entirely in bitcoin. I try to pay for things in Bitcoin whenever I can, even if I am supporting an intermediate vendor like gyft.com. I do have savings in bitcoin, but I try to spend too. Because I want to be an active part of building a robust bitcoin ecosystem. 
I kind of feel like I'm trolling in this thread a bit :)

Just for the sake of lightening up this thread, several of the homeless guys that read this post had entirely different ideas on how fawksey could keep them warm.

We have talked about it
@_date: 2013-09-18 14:39:00
The crap about socializing is actually referring to making sure you can get along with your fellow cogs on the factory production line. As long as you don't live in a shack in the woods, you will find that kids are usually quite good at socializing all on their own. They are WAY better than adults at it. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:57:52
Yeah, the price is in free fall right now
@_date: 2013-10-11 20:26:21
You know what. I really feel this. And I got really, really mad about this particular situation. But the truth is, as the states funding dwindles a lot of these police are going to end up homeless. 
And we will feed them.
And we will help them find shelter.
And I will talk to them and treat them like humans.
Because we have to be better. We cannot fight them like they fight us. You can not fight a stupid or ignorant person like that, because they will bring you down to their level and then beat you with experience.

Tents we got, actually. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:30:24
I agree entirely, even down to the non religious part :)
NO and BR have major homeless problems too. I use to live in NO. 
Society writes these people off, but it doesn't have to be like that. 
I would love to talk to you. And I would love to see an outreach in BR. 
Sean would have liked that too.

@_date: 2013-12-14 18:30:11
These always amuse me
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:19:55
Yeah, because the guys who were starving in March should be sacrificed on speculation. 
And your analogy is completely wrong. This is not a stock. It's a currency and a revolution. If people don't use it, it will have no value. So buying meals in March actually contributed to the ecosystem. Proving bitcoin has uses beyond drugs and the dark net helped increase value.
You are welcome.
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:19:35
My word
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:57:47
I was very impressed with how interested these guys were in what we do. They were very professional. Really can't thank them enough. I thought it was beautiful.
@_date: 2013-06-25 17:52:54
Dude. Let's do it. I have the sandbox and the means of dissemination
@_date: 2013-06-22 21:15:00
You rock. Thank you so much
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:37:48
We are secular. Completely.
But most people who help the homeless aren't. We are an anomoly. We had a homeless day center BURN DOWN this week. They fed 200 meals a day.
What should happen to those people? They should starve?
That board is a listing of all the groups that stepped up to help the Washburn Center after it burned. Notice Sean's Outpost has all the meals. We are the least funded in this town and we have the lions share of the support.
Know why? 
Because I don't care what you believe, if you are hungry you should get to eat.
That's what l BELIEVE IN.

This is remarkably sophomoric and short sighted. And it smacks of the kind of logic that only comes from someone who has armchair quarterbacked a situation yet never actually been part of one. 
There is a huge flaw in your logic. So big you can drive a truck through it.
 Addicts don't eat. 
Especially the ones on the street. They don't prioritize staying alive above getting their next fix. All money they get goes towards their addiction of choice. All of it. Every cent. And if they starve or dehydrate in the process, so be it. Life sucks anyway.
And that is tragic, because under all of those problems of addiction are humans. Beautiful people that are trapped by a vicious cycle that they can't figure a way out of. Because it is very, very, difficult.
But do you know when it is impossible to pick yourself out of the hole you've dug? When you are dead in the street. 
We feed everyone. We have no requirements. We treat people with respect, love and compassion. And there is no barrier to entry to receive that from us.
We would do the same for you.
@_date: 2013-09-09 17:21:09
You are awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:43:35
It is 34 degrees right now. That is mercury at my house. It was 28 degrees last night. Is it as cold as the arctic circle? No. Hypothermia sets in at 95○ core body temp. Which is very easy to do in any environment below 60 when you have no shelter sn inadequate clothing. I found the guy against the side of a building shivering in a tshirt. 
He was freezing.
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:50:23

Im pretty sure general dynamics is good on revenue. 31 billion us + annually as of 2009. They are one of the largest us defense contractors in the world. They buit the armored vehicle I drove in the army.
Im pretty sure these guys are with a think tank supported by GenDyn. Which is at least a little less concerting them the army making a wallet they can biometrically prove belongs to you.

If redditors using Reddit to feed the homeless using virtual currency that reddit loves, and with a reddit tipbot, isn't the best of Reddit, I don't know what is.
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:41:58
We do have a reserve fund, just for that reason.
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle.

Yeah. Not all from prison. They show it in the day center too. And it's on netflix. Lots of homeless have laptops.

Holy hell man. Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:01:15
Yeah man, I'm actually going to be making a video of it. They would normally have had video from the conference but they had some technical difficulties when I was up. All the NSA surveillance being done on me interferes with their equipment :)
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:38:05
We can probably arrange that
@_date: 2013-08-21 16:33:45

@_date: 2013-12-02 03:04:00
That was ridiculously cool man. I'm so happy for you. Thanks for spreading the word on bitcoin so spectacularly. If you were serious about donating, I just wanted to let you know that if you donate before Midnight tomorrow (Monday) your donation will actually be doubled by matching funds. Don't feel obligated, those coins are yours man. Spend them on whatever you want. Or be wise and hold them for 5 years and then you can have a building on war eagle campus named after you :)

@_date: 2013-10-11 16:22:35
Video shaming does work. Cop watch/Cop block is an amzingly effective tactic. I regularly engage in cop watch around the pensacola area. It has a very different effect if the people are homeless/transient/indigent. If I complain about police harassing me and show a picture, I go back to my home with my family, and my friends know where I am, people are very aware if something happens to me. If you do the same thing and you are homeless, you go back to a very vulnerable situation, where anyone can show up at anytime and no one will miss you when you are gone. And even the people who do notice and say something will be met with "Eh, he was homeless. Probably just moved on."
I am down with ANYONE who wants to file a complaint/lawsuit. I will totally support that decision. I'm just saying retaliation is a very real effect for people on the streets, so they rarely make that choice to stand up. And I completely understand why they have those reservations. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 19:31:42
Yeah. Really fucked up. 
Although, I'm sure we aren't far from the first BTC related murder "Wow...all over 1's and 0's"

It's greendot, man. They are cracking down. They can see where the moneypak was purchased, if they see a pattern of the distance between where the pak was purchased and where the card is registered being to far apart, they will shut you down. Even though you violated no tos. 
The joke is they say it's legit to load $10,000 a day on that card. Try that, see how it works for ya.
Sorry they closed your account

That's what's great about Bitcoin.  You can so easily vote with your wallet.  Thank you for donating before.  Everything helps.
We just disagree here. I feel strongly that supporting diversity in the crypto currency ecosystem actually STRENGTHENS the value of bitcoin. And there are solid use cases for litecoin being used in tandem with btc add a lot of utility to bitcoin.
I still have much love for you.  Thanks for the help.

Thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:21:00
Ok, going to try to do my best to answer all of this...
SUBSTANCE ABUSE:
If someone is willing to get treatment, I get them into a program. We have a center called lakeview here that has been really good about taking care of the guys we bring in. They will usually "find a bed" even when they are technically booked up.
The problem, as with anything, is getting someone to agree to get help. It's a balancing act. But I try to look out for signs someone is reaching out for help, and if I see that sign I try as hard as I can to get them to get help.
MENTAL PROBLEMS
This is the worst. We have no help here. Or at least effectively none. Most "mental treatment" has been done at the escambia county prison. The DOJ has rated it as the worst penal institution in the country. And the DOJ has very little interest in aring for people, so if they are willing to stand up and say it's bad...it's really, really bad.
This is an article in THE ATLANTIC entitled "One of the Darkest Times in the History of American Prisons" it focuses mostly on our jail. One of the key deficiencies there was mental health treatment. It's deplorable. They average 1.3 suicides a month.
When I do get guys to get help, they are often not able to pay for the meds, so they end up going on and off them. Which, as you probably know, makes it worse.
We need help on this front so bad. But I don't know what to do.
LIVING SITUATIONS:
This is real bad too. We have 30 Shelter Beds for a population of over 1000 homeless. The city of Pensacola knows this and they don't care. We have taken to building small micro-houses to get some people into a better situation, but it's not a fix. 
We need a permanent shelter here. But it's expensive. and the people with money don't want it. And the people like me who do can't afford to build/buy one. But we are continuing to search for options.
You can get an apartment or trailer here for $500 a month. Relatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, $500 a month might as well be a million dollars to some of these guys. Because there are virtually no jobs here. Not even for people with college degrees. So the avenues of employment for someone down and out are very, very thin.
As donations allow. We are going to start buying up old, run down houses. Paying homeless guys to fix them up and then start letting people stay there. When we are able to do this, we will do it.
We are not yet a 501c3. But we have started the filing procedure. Should be a couple of months. Well within this fiscal year.
Thanks for your well wishes and your interest.

So, we bought a water filtration system to try and start doing bottles ourselves. Maybe by reusing glass bottles. The amount of trash we have generated just on 15,000 water bottles is staggering and I would love to curb it. But refilling is very labor intensive, and labor is what we are low on.
That particular water bottle was donated. Not that I wouldn't buy nestle, it's just never been cheap. And we buy cheap. We can BLEED a bitcent. 
But I agree. Nestle sucks. But in my line of work, the phrase "Beggars can't be choosers" really applies.

We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle.

There's no need to feel like a greedy SOB. At all. Just do what you do man. That's al any of us can do.
I actually made the case for those two not being mutually exclusive in my talk at Bitcoin2013. The Bitcoin Foundation stated their main goal is for changing public opinion on Bitcoin. A really efficient way of doing that is by giving to charity in Bitcoin. People see that Bitcoin can be used for good too. More adoption. Price goes up as a bi-product. 
For one of the first times in history, the more we help people with bitcoin, the greater the value of bitcoin. True win, win.

@_date: 2013-09-21 02:46:36
Hey, thanks for the goodwill man. I'm just pointing out that I disagree with your slant on it. Even if she is saying $.60 a day is possible in watching videos and tapping silly apps, the numbers she quote would still add up to them having to get "occasional donations" in the amount of $4.11 a day. They missed a zero in the math. So they have to hustle $4.641 since a day. You titled your article "YELLOW JOURNALISM" over 53 cents. 53 cents. What can you do in America with 53 cents? honestly. I think it's awesome that you corrected the math. But she wasn't saying you could make $60 a day and it's actually 6 cents. I just think, in this case, it's a lot more likely that she made an honest mistake about a minuscule amount of money. And that you pouncing on her, over this, is probably not called for. But this is coming from me, I always think the best of people and try to give them the benefit of the doubt. 
I think she was saying that look at this pathetic amount of money you can make doing this. And that it is assumed that the rest of the money made is from panhandling. That's why there is the quote about  how it's easier to panhandle online because you don't have to put yourself out their. Asking for $5 in a forum is WAY less stressful than asking for a fiver on the street. 
Hey. Will someone give me $5? 
I don't read this article as talking about how awesome bitcoin tapper is. It is actually a very small part of the article. And she took your criticism. The same day. You usually can't get a retraction for days or months. 
I don't find this bad journalism. We all have opinions. And we are all human. 
Yellow Journalism over 53 cents I think is a bit sensationalist though. You saw your shot and you took it.

They knew I was feeding homeless with that food. They ran anyway.
But I understand, I wouldn't want someone to get fired for helping me. That's why I didn't ask permission. Plausible deniability.

We actually have amazing lawyers here. The problem is this. It boils down to their word against a police officers. Without other proof it is an exercise in futility. And evern if we were to have video or photo evidence, the amount of cops that are found guilty in such cases is miniscule. And the truth of the situation is that the complaining homeless will be alone, in the woods and vulnerable for the entire time the case is being prosecuted.

Maybe you can make that argument when they are on active duty, but after they get out it is a whole different ball game. You have to fight for benefits you are suppose to have a right to. You have to deal with everything you did for the rest of your life, which a lot of times is a terrible mental burden, and the VA mental health care is horrible on the whole. Some good docs here and there, but as a whole it is woefully understaffed and not able to keep up.
Over 40% of all homeless in the USA are veterans. That is not a coincidence. 
As for the wounded warrior project, it is very high profile. But it also utilizes a crapload of its donations for admin. Charity watch rates it a "D" charity. There are better vet charities that provide more direct benefit to veterans.

They haven't made a big deal out of this, because they are classy. But currently, all CashIntoCoins transactions are giving the option to donate the transaction fee for the sale to either BitcoinNotBombs or Sean's Outpost.
It was also pointed out this was an easy way to donate cash to these two organizations. Obviously, I'm biased here since I run Sean's Outpost, but they came up with this on their own and I thought it was pretty cool.

THIS. This is what I am talking about. 
This is a fantastic idea. We should get on this. 
This is the kind of thing where "Leveraging the future" would be great. We could create a directory of clinics and practices that take BTC and refer patients to them through the directory. Shaving a portion of the BTC payments for operating expenses and a "Health Trust".
If Bitcoin is still around in 10 years, I think we could all agree that the value of BTC will be much, much higher. Building a trust now while the price is relatively low could ensure a very sizable future endowment to keep helping people.
Bravo. I like your thoughts. We really should work on this. Its a GREAT idea.
You are right on the how insurance payments are suppose to work. They are suppose to be lower because of vendor agreements and bulk pricing. In practice, they end up charging more because the payments they receive are so sporadic, they need the payments they do receive to be larger just to cover overhead. This is where the cash discount comes in. If you need money to cover payroll. You want cash now. Laying people off shuts down your practice.
I'm sure this phenomenon is much more of a problem with smaller providers because they don't have resources to wait it out for an insurance payment. However, I know of hospitals giving royal treatment to people paying for expensive procedures in cash do to the positive impact it has on cash flow.
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:33:56

Thanks for giving such a detailed opinion. I agree with pretty much everything you said.
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle. 
Thanks for taking the time out to throw some input in down here.

@_date: 2013-06-26 16:19:52
I don't think there is any naivety.
That's what trust means. I also don't have a predisposition to thinking someone should just take the handout I give them am be content. There are several necessities in life that a slice of pizza and a cheeseburger will not fix. 
A girl I feed regularly was recently arrested for stealing tampons. She had food, I gave it to her. But a sandwich will not buy tampons. 
We look at the stories you told in fundamentally different ways. I applaud your friend for ingenuity in his black market tobacco trading. I think that shows the kind of resilience of the human spirit to adapt and overcome. We reward that kind of behavior in "sheltered' life, but persecute it just because the person lives on the street.
I have built and sold 3 companies. And what you just described is the fundamental entrepreneurial spirit. You think if I gave someone a bitcoin, they bought a pizza and sold the slices off for MORE then the cost of the pizza as a whole that's a BAD thing? Why? Because you can't have positive control over the income they generated for themselves? Because they didn't just take what they were given and eat peacefully?
That kind of ingenuity is what eventually leads people to get off the street. To engineer a workaround for being poor. That is the hacker spirit, to find the disconnect in the system and exploit it.
I applaud you for doing work with established charities. They serve a valuable purpose. But I am part of a coalition on homelessness here in which my organization is THE ONLY one physically on the streets providing assistance to these people. 
You haven't said it. But the implication of what you have said is that the people I help by giving bitcoins could somehow manipulate the system and acquire alcohol or drugs. And that very well may be true. But let me ask you, have you ever come across a person in the woods that starved to death? That lost hope in humanity because he couldn't scrounge up enough money to feed himself because he was accused of being a drunk? I have. I have seen the cold heartedness in the name of "Protecting" someone from themselves.
And what if that person actually has a substance abuse problem? Have you ever been thru withdrawal? Do you think cold, shivering in the street is the best possible scenario for going through Detox? I take people to substance abuse clinics, to detox, to sober houses...but you know what? You have to want to go. I am a recovering drug addict. I have been clean for a long while now. But until I made the choice to stay clean there was nothing anyone could say or shame me into getting better.
And what if you want help? What if you really want help but it is not available? What if you finally break down that ego wall and I take you in the front doors of the clinic crying your eyes out, and there is no bed for you so they turn you away. No room at the inn, back in the streets for you. What then?
Because there is NOT enough help for the poor, the homeless and the disenfranchised. And MYTHS and GENERALIZATIONS about those "Dirty Addicts in the Street" do more harm then you will ever know. They keep donors from funding legitimate organization. They stop help, in its tracks. And they are anecdotal bullshit, spouted by a few, that do not represent the majority of people that need help. 
And I don't just hand people money. 
I don't. But do you know why? 
Because I stop and talk to EVERYONE I meet out there. REALLY TALK TO THEM. I talk to them as a human. And I ask them what they really need. Most of the time, it's food. Sometimes, it's clothing or toiletries. Or the car that is their home has a flat tire and they are in danger of it being towed. The thing is, I find out what they need, and do my best to help them.
I am not on a blog hypothesizing about the life of a homeless person. I am in the streets almost everyday, doing what I can to keep these people alive, hopeful, and knowing that someone give a damn about them. No matter what the situation is that put them there.
I think there is some naivety about "The Beneficiaries" of my homeless outreach...I just don't think it's on this side. 
Come to Pensacola, walk the streets with me. I will change your mind. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:30:54
I would love to film this. I would absolutely love to show people how heartless some people can be. But they are never doing it when we are around. They are evil, not stupid. 
They also use code enforcement, which is a very disturbing tactic. If they had used police, there would be an audio recording. But they don't. This allows the chief of police to be able to stand at a city council meeting and declare he has no knowledge.

If you got giant piles of it, you could burn them and power a steam generator that powered your asic farm

You're not a pest at all. We try to be completely transparent with what we use our money for. We are still fairly new, only 5 months or so doing this. But our monthly figures are running somewhere around here...
Meals $3700 Healthcare$1000 Miscellaneous(Tires, Tampons, Bail, etc)$400. That is completely separate from the building projects that we are working on, we don't really have numbers on those yet. As of right now, we run at a slight loss per month that come out of volunteers pockets.
We are about to make some major, MAJOR upgrades to how we operate. We are going to bring a whole different way of accounting for how donations are used as well as tackel a much more ambitious plan for helping folks and achieving some sustainability. We hope to be able to announce this public in the next 2 weeks.
Your donation would be much appreciated. If you have other questions I will be happy to answer them at SeansOutpost
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:01:30
That's awesome. I would love to see those pics.
You design homeless shelter designs? Could you elaborate?

I love the dude hooking up the Shulgin's. Good show.

Still working on the ending...

Lol. Not entirely empty. They have crackers and a rice crispy treat in them in the pic. When the sandwhich gets added they get rolled and put into a delivery bag. So the only real way to get this shot in the production process is when they are partially full.

Mr. Boyd, I wish I was 1/2 as tenacious as you are now when I was your age. You kick much ass.
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:19:31
Thanks for chiming in. We are a registered non-profit, as such I don't know what the legal ramifications are for investing in a mining stock such as that. But I do appreciate the input.
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the (barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle. 
Thanks,

@_date: 2013-11-24 03:39:41
Thanks man
@_date: 2013-10-12 00:59:47
Yeah, it is par for the course. Homeless are treated like vermin. They think that running them off will somehow fix the problem. And a cheap razor is all you need to destroy a person's shelter. It makes me sick.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:39:03

Same here. Thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-05-18 19:48:18

Bitcoins don't move except within the blockchain. All that moves is access to the wallet.  
Tax implications are going to vary based on jurisdiction.

It's true. Making donations as frictionless as possible helps the entire process.

Hey eveyone, thank you so much for your support. We have distributed all the meals for the day all FORTY THREE of them!!! I made a write up on it on the site...
@_date: 2013-08-21 00:27:09
We are a non-profit, so IPO is not really appropriate for us. HOWEVER, we do have something really, really awesome up are sleeve that will allow for much more community interaction. Stay tuned, same bit time, same bit channel!

Hell yeah. Merry Christmas.

@_date: 2013-12-15 16:32:53
Appreciate the love. I really do. But I cant think of anything that will lose us trust in the homeless community faster than toting a team of cameramen around into a bunch of homeless camps.

Common mistake though :)
@_date: 2013-08-03 12:39:07
I just contacted the guys at AquaponicsAndEarth.org to see if they would be willing to accept bitcoin. If they will, I will do my best to see that we can fund them. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:53:38
Yay! Thank you so much
@_date: 2013-10-10 00:53:40
Thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-08-09 12:41:31
Thanks man, good looking out. 
We are very familiar with these cards. And if we can't get her bank account set up, she will definitely be going this route. FYI, here are a few drawbacks...
1. They will not pay initial benefits to one. If you don't have a bank you have to get a paper check. So this wouldn't have stopped the situation we had yesterday.
2. If this gets lost or stolen, there is no local branch to deal with for access to your money
3. When transitioning to this, a lot of times there is a skipped month where your check has stopped, but you don't have your card in hand. When you get the card it will have all your missed benefits, but losing access to your money for a month can be catastrophic
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:23:54
Yes, but once you had convinced them to accept BTC this once, all future haircuts would be hassle free. 
Go on!
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:19:19
Yes, Aquaponics is one of the first on the list. If you want to point us in the right direction I would love to hear from some people on it. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:04:34
Wow. That would be killer. Honey is great. Seemlessly integrating bitcoin would be fricking delightful.
 
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:36:55
I agree. And we do have a reserve fund for just this reason. 
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle.

@_date: 2013-09-06 01:55:43
You are awesome. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:35:36
Just wow guys.
First off, thank you so very much. I really was crying. For awhile. It was so much more than I had ever imagined. For the record, both Martin and Nakowa had mentioned, quite casually that they wanted to contribute. I had no idea how much. None. This was shocking and so very humbling.
For a guy that is grateful for every bitcent that is donated, donations of this size are a "bit" overwhelming. So much good will be done because of this donation. 
THIS is the true power of bitcoin. From , quite literally, a world away two people are able to ensure an entire community of homeless in Pensacola will have at least one safe place to go for the next year. Stop and think about that. Just for a second. No friction, no discussion, no asking for permission. Just guaranteeing a safe place for the less fortunate, for an entire year, in an instant. 
Thank you Martin.
Thank you Nakowa.
Thank you LetsDice.
This is incredible, fantastic, astounding, humbling, awesome, amazing, and unexpected.
But I have learned, this community will never stop surprising me. 
Thank you, from the very bottom of my heart.

This is another discussion all together. But 1) Anyone can teach, you do not need to study for it. 2) Higher Education is completely broken in this country so much so that I don't think it will exist in it's present form in a decade. Knowledge is free. Codifying it doesn't make it more valuable. 3) If my kids want to goto college, they will have no problems. 4) There is SIGNIFICANTLY more diversity in our homeschool than in public school.

That's why we need a stable SMS wallet. It's not just for the 3rd world. It's for the less fortunate in the US too. Most homeless have free cell phones paid for by the government. They double as tracking devices.
And I think you will be surprised how fast bitcoin will be adopted by the homeless. For the same reason pMesa thrives in Africa. Carrying cash on the street has a lot of problems.

This is some really great work
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:38:54
We really have talked about it. It's just a fine line. 
And your suggestion probably isn't feasible. These camps are these peoples homes, I'm not cool with being like "Hey, I'm bringing a film crew into your home. If you don't like it leave."
It has been difficult enough to get still shots of folks. But I do think a video would be beneficial. I just need to put some thought into it. Maybe I will start talking to people on the street and seeing who would be interested in talking. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:42:06

If we were in a world, where people weren't starving, I would understand. Expiration dates have nothing to do with food validity for the most part. I really do understand the quandary with liability when you are a business. But the thought that you would be sued by someone pulling from your dumpster is a myth propagated by insurance companies and underwriters.  
For me, personally, and any of the startups I founded, I would always take the risk. Because I would be confident in standing by my convictions for the reasoning in feeding a starving person over covering my ass. But I realize that is a personal choice, and that I am not the norm in how I handle risk.
@_date: 2013-08-04 04:36:10

My oldest daughter was in a public magnet school for a few months when she was in second grade. She came home crying one day because the librarian wouldn't let her check out books that were at the 7th grade level because they told her she couldn't read them. I took her to school the next day and had her read the first few pages of that book out loud to the librarian. Then we went to the front office and dis-enrolled her and haven't looked back. Public school makes good workers, not thinkers.

They aren't mining. She's referring to him earning bitcoins online. Laptops are all hand me downs that most people would consider unusable. And if you have a house and all the stuff that most americans have, laptop, smartphone, bike...when you can no longer afford to pay rent. Are you supposed to give all of your possession over because you are no longer entitled to have stuff if you have no home?

We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle. 
Thanks for giving us your opinion. I really appreciate it.

So says the BenejeserBIT
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:08:12
I'm going to plagiarize myself from answering a similar question on bitcointalk.org
The answer isn't simple, for a lot of reasons. The biggest is we have been in operation for a relatively short period of time, since March 17, 2013. So we don't have solid income data. And the second is that we have DRAMATICALLY increased the scope of what we do over that time so we have much larger costs now than we did in March. 
But if you average it out we run at a deficit of about $600 per month over direct operational costs. We maintain no office, or administrative staff, and have not billed any fundraising activities against donations. The simple fact is that right now my wife and I pay out of pocket every month to make ends meet. And we are very happy to do that.
There are reasons for that. One is we have never yet engaged in any formal fundraising. Not that we are against it, we have just been very fortunate at the level of contributions we have received from the crypto currency community. To reach a stasis and be truly sustainable we will have to move past that at some point. But we are in the fortunate position of being able to take our time and build fundraising mechanisms/campaigns that make sense for us and are not knee jerk reactions.
I would also like to point something else out, your initial question...
What percentage of your donations go towards administrative costs?
Is a very standard question. And I think it's the wrong question. Currently by that criteria we are a home run, 100%+ direct operational costs. But that isn't as important to me as the end results of what we are able to accomplish. I think charities and non-profits should be judged like startups, only on their results.
For instance which would you prefer...
Non-Profit A
7% Adinistrative costs, 93% Operational that effects an 11% decline in the rate of homelessness in its operational area.
Non-Profit B
43% Administrative costs, 57% Operational that effects a 90% decline in the rate of homelessness in the operational area
I would hope you would want Non-Profit B. I would want Non-Profit B. 
I firmly believe that the metric to optimize for is end results. 
This is the talk that really changed my thinking...
I hope you can take the time to watch it. It is an amazing talk. Dan Pallotta is one of my heros.
I hope I answered your question well enough. I would be happy to talk more about this. And you can always email me at BeingHomelessisNotACrime
Thanks for the interest.

So, admittedly, the information on our projects is spread out a lot right now. But the PURPOSE of the houses we build is actually to provide an employment outlet for those homeless that want to work. We imagine the farming operations will be the same way. 
And legally, it's just paying a contractor.

This is really cool. A friend and I have actually been working on this exact system and have been using a functioning prototype for a month or so. We've been very hesitant about getting public testing until it's a lot closer to bulletproof. I know that's sort of against lean design principles, but when people are sending irreversible monetary transactions, I think a developer has that responsibility.
What are the biggest problems you have had so far in development? What hurdles do you see for adoption of this type of wallet?
Best of luck to you. it looks really good. There is huge need for this. We started working on it as a method of bringing BTC to the homeless population here in the US, using that as a test bed and then pushing for it's distribution in the 3rd world. If you are interested in collaborating at all. Hit me up.

Thank you for that. I appreciate the statement a lot.
But what's really cool, is I'm not a hero. I am just a guy. And thats what is amazing. You don't have to be anything spectacular to really help. You just have to choose to. When I first started doing this, I asked the people that were doing it lots of stupid "business guy questions"
Do we need a license. What about liability. Trespassing? Zoning laws...yada yada yada.
What I know now, is all you need to do is give a shit. Because so few people actually give a shit.

Most are shit. Really. It sucks to say so, but its true. You can look up what most charities percentages of donations are in terms of how they use the money. It's ridiculous how little passes thru in a lot of cases. We are really small, but right now ALL plus some from our own pocket passes thru.

@_date: 2013-09-09 20:13:14
You have a very common attitude, that's not really founded in reality. Shiting anf pissing in public is already illegal as it should be. Most homeless don't fit anywhere near that stereotype.
In escambia county, where we are based, there are over 1000 homeless, but only 30 shelter beds. Yet, it is illegal to BE homeless. So for the crime of being poor, you will goto jail at a cost of over $4000 per month to the taxpayer, or 2/3 the cost of permanently housing a homeless person for a year.
Is what we are doing fixing everything, hell no. But it is a chance for people to be able to try and figure things out before being arrested.
And NOBODY at the outpost lays around. There is always more work to be done.
And if the idea of me giving someone down on their luck a chance to feel some self worth by building a house or growing food turns your stomach, maybe you need a stronger stomach.

Thanks for taking an interest here. I always love hearing your perspective.
I think it's all a balancing act, but the core take away isn't to be more business. It's more about untethering the non profit sector and allowing it to be "relentlessly resourceful" (if we are channeling our inner Paul Graham).
In your example of $49 spent to make $50, I do think business would do that if that is the best option, but a good business would prefer to see a better multiple of return. And the core to all of this is to measure the results of the charity for its cause more than the funding mechanism. 
As to the high paid salary. I'm not advocating for wall street ceo salaries for non-profits. But there is another thing to consider. Hiring is one if the most difficult jobs a organization will have. Poor hiring choices can hinder a company more tgan anything else. And there is a real chance that the people best suited to running a large non profit are already well paid in the "for profit" world. And they very well may have the financial obligations that come from that position. In that case, if the non profit can't be competitive with compensation, there is no way they will ever get access to that talent.
But its totally a balancing act. And transparency and communication with your support base is key.
Miss you Vitalik

Dude. Never apologize for being a ghostbusters nerd. We had an entire board meeting at Sean's Outpost to discuss the feasibility of converting an old hearse style ambulance into a mobile food station. 
Complete with gostbusters styled paint job.
Unfortunately, practicality won the day

Thanks for the love. I got the donation while talking to Al Jazeera :)
@_date: 2013-09-21 01:45:15
The article says 4 or 5 bitcoins over the course of 3 or 4 months.    Use the middle of those figures and just say 4.5BTC over 105 days. I'm having a hard time getting an average btc price over that time period, but it looks like around $110. So that is earning $495 over 105 days or a grand total of $4.71 a day. I find it completely reasonable that those guys can hustle up an average of $5 a day. Especially when I have seen redditors donate over $50 in a single day. This article is talking about these guys earning about HALF the minimum wage per hour PER DAY. No one is saying "Look at this guy getting rich on BTC"  or "You should quit your job and hustle bitcoins on the street." This is a pittance of money. The mistake was pointed out and they corrected it the same day. And the total of BTC they said is accurate, they just should have focused more on "digital panhandling". Obviously, I am biased here. No way around it. But I think the tone of this article is way, way out of proportion. The guys in it are still on the street. Bitcoin is helping them. It's not fixing everything, But it’s better than nothing. Much better than nothing.
@_date: 2013-08-04 03:38:50
I think, what needs to happen is a hybrid of the two concepts you are talking about. I might technically be a "middleman" but I'm down at ground level. I actually know the exact spot where funding is being used and for what. That level of granular transparency is horribly lacking from most charities. Non-Profits and Charities, at least in the US are giant, bloated, bureaucratic dopplegangers of their corporate cousins. They are money making enterprises, with very little actual effect hitting the people who need it. The largest homeless outreach in my area has a CEO that makes $250,000 a year...to help the homeless. 
What I'm trying to do, and what we need to see more of is lean startup methodologies applied to non-profits. Small, lithe, fast moving organizations that knock large incumbents off their rocker and either take over market share or force the big guys to step up their game to compete.
@_date: 2013-08-01 19:49:36
That might be the funniest thing I have ever read on reddit
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:04:25
Yeah, those guys are the best. Especially seeing that Alexis Ohanian, founder of reddit loves both non profits and bitcoin and just funded buttercoin.

First, I think you will probably get screwed selling anything on paypal.
However, I have thought that you could circumvent paypal virtual currency rules by selling a small physical item and giving the btc away with purchase. That way you could send something and get a tracking number and physical delivery confirmation

I smile everytime you comment. I'm so glad we were able to change your mind on us.
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle.

I definitely understand this sentiment. I feel the same way a alot. However, I feel like a premium electornics/gaming device like this probably has a lot more cross over into our ranks then some other "Let's Get Them to Take Bitcoin" ideas. 
And the fact that the founder opened with "I believe in Bitcoin" and specifically asked for people to write him is hopeful as well.

Crack is really hard to come by here. Basically because cocaine is in very short supply here and is of unsuitable purity to sustain the reaction making it into crack. What passes for crack here is a dangerous mix of shake and bake meth and mdpv. The people using it would find it difficult to use bitcoin or even write to Wired's standards.

You are more than welcome. I have had at least 5 visitors from Reddit come walk the streets here. Each left different.
But, come on man. You used your friends story (GENIUS story btw) to prop up the concept that homeless guys having access to money was a bad idea.
 And what if they ate half the pizza and sold the rest?
My point being, your point was homeless guys having access to money is bad. I think that's pretty clear. We have fundamentally different views on that. Unless you are just on here to be a contrarian troll, which wouldn't really be out of character for reddit.
There is no ill will here man. You are welcome to your own opinion, on anything. And I am totally down with that.
 You shared an anecdote. I'm just explaining how this applies to my continuing research with a very large sample group of homeless I have direct contact with.

I want to believe too. And I do believe.
Where Bitcoin is different is in being decentralized.You cannot simply unplug a data center and shut Bitcoin down.  Unlike Liberty Reserve. 
And I think there is real pressure that if cryptocurrency is the future of money, and the US pushes innovation in it overseas, we will lose a sizeable advantage. And you know how much the USA likes to take advantage.

Thanks for the input. We DO have an emergency fund. It was actually one of the contingencies, we insisted on before moving forward with the forest. I would, however, really like to make it grow into a much more protective safety net.

I am, PM'd you.

It's also a little misleading because GE is absolutely a financial services company. Yes, they make electrical stuff as well, but most of their revenue is derived from financial services.

If no one ever buys things with BTC that will never happen. The Bitcoin economy depends on people being willing to support it in methods other than just holding it.
And probably more like 100 handles...

We will find you a place to stay too. We actually have some guys we serve that mine with gpu's from a public park ganking wifi from the federal building across the street. You can regale them with tales of the ASICs that almost were...
But hopefully you'll just get your rig and not become a street urchin
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:07:05
Yeah man, as far as I know, it's just us. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:59:03
That's what we did.
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in. That being said, All the rest of the tips we receive on reddit for the rest of the year(barring they are given for a specific purpose) will be split like this, 50% will go into an emergency/reserve fund for Satoshi Forest, 25% will go towards operating expense and 25% will go towards paying down the principle.

Two of my Three kids use bitcoin. They are both girls ages 9 and 7. They get paid for chores/allowance in BTC. They have used it thru gyft to buy things off of Amazon and thru ZEEVEX to buy stuff in online games like WoosWorld.
But, mostly, they save it. Because they hear daddy talk about how valuable it's going to be one day. And they figure if they hold onto it for 5 or 6 years they can emancipate themselves from mom and dad if they want to.
My 5 year old LOVES bitcoin, but he doesn't have the finess down to rock his own wallet yet. He does however have a bunch of Bitcoin patches on his clothes and uses Bitcoin patches as the coins from mario bros with wis stuffed mario and luigi.

Thanks Heather :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:21:48
If this was my money, I agree.
If you give me bitcoins to feed the homeless and I choose to speculate on Bitcoins future value instead, I am ...
A) being dishonest about my work
B) gambling with the base support of the downtrodden
Which is 
C) wrong
Volatility means ups and DOWNS. There would be no argument at all if the price were down. None of us have a crystal ball.

Thank you so much. Your generosity is inspiring. We will do so much good with this. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:27:29
This is revolution guys. The first one thru the wall always gets bloody. But everything you loved about Bitcoin a week ago, is still exactly the same.
$266 was the all time high, until it wasn't.

@_date: 2013-11-01 20:39:28
I'll take it. You are awesome too
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:17:55
I like your math.
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:02:56
Hell yeah! That would be awesome. Keep me in the loop on that

add .com to my name or google my name

That's awesome. Very cool you guys checked that place out.
@_date: 2013-10-12 12:17:42
It is very cruel. And very common. Humans can really suck.
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:39:16
Matt, you are still young man, so maybe you don't know this yet. The happiest moments of your life, the points in time that weave together to make it worthwhile to be alive and human. They are very often peppered with tears. And I have no shame in crying. Tears of joy. This community is amazing. 
@_date: 2013-10-13 15:12:55
Guys, this is Bitcoin. If you want a better forum, build it. I thought that's what we did? Why are you just screaming at the incumbent to do better? 
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:21:47
I'm Jason. Sean was my best friend who was murdered. The outpost is named in his honor. Thanks for the love, and I really appreciate the donation.

Pensacola is where we are. But Miami has one of the best Bitcoin scenes :)
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:52:41
hell yeah
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:52:36
I agree completely. We have a reserve fund for just this reason.
We have decided that we are going to pay off the December mortgage, so that we are paid up thru the end 2014. After, talking with counsel, it was determined this was probably the most responsible thing we cold do, taking care of known debts in the calendar year we are still in.

Thanks man. Just trying to help
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:34:26
I already sent them a heads up. I think they can help
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:19:27
It's Jason...but you are most welcome.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:47:56
thats a bold statement.
I like it. Maybe we could set up an unlicensed doctors for criminals on sik road
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:56:04
You should probably read more about us. It seems like you really aren't familiar with what we do.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:03:18
Hey man, I'm Jason. Sean Dugas was my best friend who was murdered last year. I run the Outpost in his memory.
Its a common mistake.
And yes, we will have an update before Christmas. Thanks for the support.
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:03:41
Yeah, and remind all the folks at home...how much did it cost you to send that money from Switzerland to finance that meal in Florida?
@_date: 2013-09-09 18:06:45
Yeah, I think adults should be able to do what they want. But at least to start, we aren't taking chances.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:06:04
Yep, when people say they can stop Bitcoin, I say the spice must flow.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:38
No. But...we do support Food Not Bombs heavily here in Pensacola. Those guys rock and we try to give them food and help whenever we can.

I've said it before, those guys are awesome
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:15:22
I can make you a patch that says that

Man. That is amazing. Thank you so much.

I think someone will physically run across the US to raise awareness for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:32:00
I think Mt. Gox could burn down in a fiery pillar, while their (now on fire) CEO punched babies and kittens in the face and Roger and his businesses would walk out unscathed singing "Get that dirt off your shoulder"

This is really cool.
The site interface is super simple and clean. I may want to run a project up the flag pole soon.
Good luck with your farm. I just gave you your first (small) donation. Best of luck

Holy crap. You are amazing.  Thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:38:27
It's true.
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:45:39
You should go get some pizza at Two Amy's, you won't be sorry. And hit up the currency display at the Smithsonian American History Museum.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:39:22
Thank you so much.
I'm just a guy. And my name is Jason.
Sean, who the Outpost is named after was my best friend. Google the name Sean Dugas. He was murdered in August of last year.  He was a great, truly unique individual. And I am proud to do the service I can in his memory.
I miss you Sean. Very much.
@_date: 2013-09-25 11:54:56
Yeah, I don't agree with you in pretty much any form. But if you would read a little more about us you would see that we pay homeless to build houses for other homeless, teach modern construction techniques, and have just started an organic farm to teach how to grow your own food.
We are all about giving someone a leg up.
We just don't let the ones who don't starve to death in the gutter.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:14:53
Wow. This was a big surprise to wake up to. Thank you everyone.

@_date: 2013-10-22 14:41:08

@_date: 2013-10-08 02:35:37
all the crimes.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:42:15
I think we should start a blacklist of US Federal Reserve Note Serial Numbers that have ever been used to fund violence, buy drugs, or are the proceeds of a crime.
Then no one can use fiat :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:56:28
Thank you so much!!!
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:14:37
See, I think your wrong. Talking about it is very helpful to disruption. 50 surgeons now know what the hell that Bitcoin thing is. Because of you.
When they look at the New Yorker and see the press, they will remember you talking about it. And maybe one of them ends up talking to their front office manager about it. And the next thing you know there is a QR reader at checkout. Little efforts. By a lot of people. Grow.
Just like your Bitcoins.
Glad you got the job too!!!
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:59:46
We are just trying to help. Thanks for the kind words.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:11:42

@_date: 2013-09-16 17:52:50
Thank you so much! Go post it in the bitcointalk thread!!

Thanks man! That's awesome
@_date: 2013-09-10 02:12:58
To's shoes uses the same "distribution model" and they are wildly successful. They are actually the other example I give when talking about this. 
We aren't sitting on inventory that is expiring. I think that was a big problem with OLPC. And with technology in general. 
A house, will still be a house in 20 years. If it is built well.
We are taking a product, that would have a "market value" of $30,000+ and selling TWO of them for $15,000 with one of them going to a homeless person. I think that's pretty damn low and pretty intriguing to people in the market for this kind of house.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:01:31
Hell yeah. Go get 'em Erik
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:02:31
Thank you so much!!!
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:11:31
i just ate the hobbit hole breakfast with my family for Xmas Eve Dinner. I would have totally hooked you up with a BTC tip.
@_date: 2013-08-03 11:49:17
I will get right on that. Seriously
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:32:42
Yeah, we will.probably keep helping them with food. Im also kicking around the idea of trying to raise a little money to help jesse buy tools for his business. If that happens I would probably trustee those funds.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:16:16
Hold that thought. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:29:32
If I list a place on your site, is it possible for me to get my payout in BTC?!?!!?!?! If this is possible or will become possible, I am so in.

And I second that motion that I would love to throw some business a local r/bitcoin 'ers way.

I agree with this what you say here. But if you want to play it to the bone it would be 90 days before we would even be in foreclosure. Obviously that's not the plan, but it is the truth.

Lol, it was a joke. I run a bitcoin homeless outreach. I was just asking if you gave a discount to non-profits. 
Best of luck with the business. Please let us know when you get your first bitcoin customer.
