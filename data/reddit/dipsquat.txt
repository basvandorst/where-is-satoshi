So I am unfamiliar with the details, but what could possibly make it miss the mark by up to 5 years?

Aren't we currently down 50% in 1 month?  What's the stat for that?
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:03:26
Thank you.  That point I understand.
My question is:
Of the 210 times the fall was bigger than 30%, how many times was it bigger than 50%?
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:39:47
Anyone skilled enough to show how much $USD has been mined in bitcoin vs how much was growth?
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:55:39
Do you know where I can look up statistics like this?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:35:51
I am genuinely confused (not just arguing)  What is the reason for being upset about this?  Don't the mathematics after all the taxes and such, end up with the recievers having more than they started with?  I realize it created a tax event, but it appears to me that it also creates a much bigger addition of value?  What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:46
where do you see that?
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:32:53
Thanks for the reply.  Despite the other guy, I think I understand what you mean.

no worries, I also tried to publish a test article on Y'alls, and it shows the payment was successful from HTLC but on Y'alls there shows payment error.  Can I check/verify this on a test blockchain somewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:00:55
Do you mean make another "Alt-coin"?

So if one wanted to start a career in the crypto currency sector, would this be a good starting point?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:38:09
Where are you seeing that?  I don't have any BCH, so maybe that's why I can't find it
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:22:05
Looks great but who is O'm?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:48:27
What was your resolution to this?  I had something also flagged with this 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:12:25
is this telling me not to use an exchange?
Or is it telling me to use my wallet to transact on an exchange (but without telling me HOW to do that)?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:31:05
If someone gives you $300k and says: here, its your's but you have to pay taxes, what's the problem with selling it and paying the taxes and being happy?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:12:31
I had a send error, how do I send it to the devs?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:18:00
Shut the front door...  
For a cup of coffee?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:54
Send Payment Failed
Payment failed to send. This can happen due to temporary network connectivity issues or an unexpected server error.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:49:20
Think of all the new people here the last few months.  I just recently got into bitcoin myself and of course the first thing I discovered was that I couldn't even buy a cup of coffee because the fees were going to be as much or more than the coffee itself (not to even mention the delay.)  I didnt really believe it and thought I was doing something wrong, so I came to this subreddit and asked about it.   Now imagine 1000 new coinbase users everyday, and how many people you think are just learning about the fees and delays for the first time.  Your first bitcoin purchase doesn't come with an explanation of all that.

what is w/ u/hthomison1078?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:01
Same here, did you figure it out?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:03:26
but are YOU legit?  
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:06:02
Correct, I bought, and sold, and bought, and sold....  is there a way to do this using the exchange while securely using my wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:37:23
what does a question mark mean?  Don't we know if they are using segwit or not?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:08:32
ok i see now
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:50:16
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:14:00
so, basically, my local coffee shop does not accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:58:28
Does it bother you that whoever owns the wallet company knows all the seeds?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:08:24
i see
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:35:06
Thank you for the answer!
Hypothetically, if the mining efforts doubled overnight, wouldn't bitcion be using twice the electricity with the same end result?
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:30:09
I'm a noob so help me understand the privacy part.  We want all the transactions to be public right (decentralized?)  What is it we are making private that isn't already private?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:16:27
but i though the whole point of bitcoin was that its ledger was public
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:46:35
