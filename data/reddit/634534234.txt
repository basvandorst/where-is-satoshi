It's far better to use Electrum or something similar that to rely on any third party system. 
Blockchain.info recently had a major flaw with its mobile wallet, I would be wary of using it.

Big money won't touch Bitcoin without regulated exchanges. There will always be shady unregulated exchanges for people to use, and inevitably lose their money eventually. 
There is already a massive risk investing in Bitcoin, losing your money to scams can't be an added risk if we expect mainstream adoption. If you think non-diehards are going to send tens/hundreds of thousands of dollars to some mystery bank account in eastern Europe and hope they don't exit scam/get hacked before they get their coins, you don't know much about large investors.
The fact that Bitfinex would rather ban New York users rather than pay $5000 and follow some basic rules tells me that they're not a company I would use for more than pocket change.

I agree that our governments let big banks get away with murder, but very few other bankers have actually stolen $650,000,000 in customer funds so blatantly.

Right, people are lining up to dump money into exchanges run by anonymous (possibly) Russians.
Yeah, I'm the one who doesn't know what their talking about. Enjoy your an-cap circle jerk in this sub, I hope you realize it's the reason people laugh off Bitcoin on first glance. Here in the real world people don't trust anonymous websites with millions of dollars.

Plus your nickname.

Obviously you have never had a real job or been involved in a real company if you think 500 pages means something is automatically overly burdensome.
I swear 70% of the people on this sub are 16 year olds who are halfway through the Fountainhead. It's embarrassing.

No, but almost nothing ancaps believe is true. 
It makes them feel good to think they're smarter than everyone else though.
