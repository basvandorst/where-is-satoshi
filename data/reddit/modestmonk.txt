Its good if they ask you for permissions. Just evaluate them properly. If a screensaver wants to connect to the Internet and access all your files and contacts you might not want to install it.

There will be nothing. They don't care, they suck.

And I was never against iOS apps. Just that BTC advocates are most likely better off with Android devices if they want to make sure they can use BTC apps now and in the future.

Plus in some countries some providers dont throttle properly for whatever reason after you maxed the 3g data cap :)

What do you think about this? 
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:20:57
It's still Apple and they might take BTC apps off the store again anytime. Unless you are really not technology savvy or completely invested in the Apple ecosystem you are better off with an Android device anyway.

Im a realist that tries to stay rational but thanks.

What was their bullshit excuse again? They are not news but entertainment?

This. Plus if you root your phone you are most likely smart enough to not install some crapware that wants ridiculous permissions.

Apple allows Bitcoin apps (until it doesnt again).

You are aware that people tend to use humor to deal with their fears?

Wow wtf. I ll email my friends in the us about you. Seriously, please fucking win this thing.

I'm seriously happy to see someone like him, a decent human, in US politics. It's a shimmer of hope.

Im not up to date with the last iOS update but can you already choose different keyboards for your input? Do you have multiple proper torrent apps? Do apps communicate with each other so when you share something you can open it in another app for example? Can you add attachments when you reply to emails? Do you have mobile porn search apps (not crucial for most people but you get the idea)?
If you opt for Apple you are bound to one company that dictates how much they charge you for your hardware and software and what you can get and what not. Android means you have plenty of options but lets stop this here. No need to argue if more options are better or not.
Enjoy the walled garden.

Glad to hear iOS is catching up. Still can't use custom launchers and that apps don't really interact with each other if they are not default apps is killing things for me. External SD cards and replaceable high capacity batteries are also something I dont want to miss anymore.
But yeah, each their own. I don't see why someone who likes tech would get an Apple device when you can simply get more out of Android but thats just my opinion. My mom has an iOS device (I bought for her) and she is very happy.

I don't care about despair if it does not affect me. How something affects you is what you make out of it. You can either:
A) Look only for good news and be happy if you find them. 
B) Just look for news and be unhappy if they are not good and happy if they are good. (Seems that's what you do.)
C) Look for news and just accept them without much emotion.
D) Stay away from news.
E) Other things I forgot to mention.
I prefer C. It's not rocket science and super chilled out. You can train acceptance by practicing meditation. Sounds weird to mention in a Bitcoin sub huh? Yeah but frees you from being a slave to your emotions and that helps in every area of life.

Enjoy the rollercoaster, I ll stick to equanimity :)

You are right with what you say but its complete bullshit if he tries to argue he did something proper and innovative. Which judge will even listen? They got to play the character card. That's the one that might help.
Don't forget we still live in a time where people go to jail for smoking and selling weed in most places. 
The Internet and generation reddit might move fast, but real life is still fucking slow with most things that make sense. No surprise considering the whole system is jammed up with "special interest groups" who "worked" so hard to get us to this point.

Understand the bigger picture. The prison lobby makes sure a lot of outdated laws and policies stay in place (war on drugs...).

Of course, good luck with your app. It's just annoying how dependent we devs are when it comes to the app store. If I sell access to some of my websites Apple slaps me with a 30% tax only because I offer an app to users and I can't even let users download the app directly from my website for free.
The app store is still where you can make decent money but the way Apple handles things, pretty much sucks.
