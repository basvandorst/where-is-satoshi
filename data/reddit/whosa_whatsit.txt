It’s still a lot of money, but enough that he still blows through it if I remember right. And he’s spending it on a military R&amp;R planet where everything is exorbitantly expensive anyways

Wouldn’t change a goddamn thing. I’m happy

Yea, you would have to do it without being too greedy. I don’t think something like .5-1% of market cap would cause too bad of a ripple

Bitcoin is easier to steal at gunpoint than conventional wealth
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:28:39
No. All they need is a key, right?
It would be nearly impossible to steal ALL of a conventionally wealthy person’s money at gunpoint, which is usually spread out over several bank accounts, investment accounts which take time to liquidate, locked into CDs or other long term investments. 
THEN, you would have to jump through hoops with bankers and intermediaries to have the money transferred. 
All you would have to do to get Bitcoin is put a gun to their head, and even if they are safe about it you would just have them take you to their safe/computer/hole in the ground/whatever to retrieve their private key.

Have you seen the rest of the movie?

Because I said “wealth” and not “cash”
It doesn’t even have to be ALL of their wealth. But if you see a dude driving a lambo with bitcoin on the back, I guarantee it’s easier to steal $100k worth of bitcoin from that dude than it is to steal $100k of cash from a lambo driver without bitcoin.

He sold his bitcoin when it hit its highest evaluation. Not hard to understand

Not all stocks pay dividends

Yea, but that happens to be the most recent 8 months. The end is nigh gentlemen. The hype is gone. Something this unstable will never be a full-on currency, no matter how private and secure
