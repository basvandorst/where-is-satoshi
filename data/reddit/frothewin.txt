I know, but the worst a robber could do with your public key is send you Bitcoin.

Wouldn't the actual equivalent be your recovery seed?

He even calls them "recreations". One of the people in his book claims he doesn't know who John Boehner is which is clearly false:
Whatever validates your views of Trump though.

Some accounts are true. Some are false. He even says so in the intro of his book.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:21:50
"a fact that is consistent with other accounts of aids being worried about Trump developing alzheimers"
Circular reasoning. The Bible is true because the Bible says it's true. It's clear he doesn't have Alzheimer's if you watch the meeting he had with Congress earlier this week. It's also obvious to anyone with critical reasoning skills that Trump knew who Boehner was.
"Again, that doesn't mean they are false."
It means they didn't actually happen.

How do you expect communism to work in a system where I completely control the Bitcoin I own? How do you expect to take my Bitcoin from me if I don't want to give it to you?

Then you're not a border-line communist.

I'm not making a value judgement. I'm just saying your beliefs aren't borderline Communist.

If we were talking about literally slavery, then yes. But Kanye was referring to the slave mindset in the current day, 400 years later. That mindset is a choice.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:13:31
It was obvious what he was saying before the fact too. The sentences after make it obvious what he was talking about.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:43:54


To you. There are people who knew what he meant before he clarified what he said with that Tweet. Scott Adams is one of them. I am another.
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:43:16
Scott Adams interpreted him correctly too before that Tweet. Maybe the problem is the lense you're reading it through.
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:22:02
No, they make complete sense when you realize he's talking about the slavery mindset that has existed for 400 years that the black community hasn't gotten over. That mindset is a choice.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:51:49
You can check his Twitter. He's been tweeting a lot about it:
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:05:54
No but it's fun to try. It also gets other people to see how retarded they are.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:16:52
He's not saying it was a choice when they were slaves. He's saying its a choice now that they're not.
They've had this mentality for 400 years and it's a choice now that they're not. You can even read his tweet where he clarifies this.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:53:06
He was on point here:
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:07:44
Because they haven't changed their mentality over those 400 years despite no longer being slaves.
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:08:10
That's not an argument.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:54:10
That's not an argument. He still called it correctly before Kanye's Tweet.
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:09:25
That's not at all what he said. He was talking about the self-victimization the black community has about slavery.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:48:16
He wasn't blaming slaves. He was blaming blacks for not getting over the slave mentality 150 years later. Obviously it wasn't a choice for actual slaves. That's not what he's talking about. He even clarified this in his Twitter post.
I only speak for myself, not other Trump supports.
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:40:25
You're intentionally ignoring this part right after:


He's very obviously talking about the slave mentality persisting to this day. It's why he said 400 years and not 250.


Yes. He visited Trump in Trump tower right after he won. He was also ranting about similar stuff around that time:


I've been a Kanye fan since MBDTF so this has nothing to do with Trump. I'm just a libertarian who agrees with what he says.
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:31:38
I think you responded to the wrong person.
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:15:06
He's saying the current day black community is living in the past as if they're still slaves and that they need to stop self-victimization themselves. Literal slavery was only around for 250 years, so it's obvious he's talking about the slave mentality that has persisted to the present day.
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:24:25
Because the prison mindset has existed for 400 years. It was valid during slavery and the generation after. It isn't valid anymore.
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:58:49
You can view it here:
Multiple people knew what he meant before that Tweet. That should tell you there's a problem with how you initially interpreted it.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:06:28
He uses "were" because he's saying they're not actually slaves anymore and they need to get out of that mentality. You can tell because he asks:


@_date: 2018-05-02 23:24:15
Or you could just read his Tweet:
 


@_date: 2018-05-02 13:26:30
Wrong again. He was talking about the prison mentality blacks put themselves in who are generations removed from slavery:
When you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years?! That sounds like a choice. Like, you were there for 400 years and it’s all of you all? Like, we’re mentally in prison. Like, slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks,” he said. “So prison is something that unites us as one race, blacks and whites being one race. We’re the human race.”
"the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought It was just an idea"
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:10:44
No, he's talking about the current day black community. That should be obvious because they're not slaves anymore.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:57:48
That's why he followed that statement by asking, "you were there for 400 years and it’s all of you all?" They *weren't* there for those first 250 years, that's his point.
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:31:49
Again, that's his point. It's a choice in the current day because they're no longer slaves. They have had the same mentality for 400 years despite no longer being slaves.
It's also impossible to voluntarily be a slave so there's that too.
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:28:29
Yes he did:


"the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought It was just an idea"
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:16:03
That doesn't even make sense. Slavery in the US hasn't been around for 400 years. It was around for about 200. Clearly he's talking about a mindset because he's including the present day in that 400 number.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:48:18
He's always had a hard time translating his thoughts into words in interviews.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:45:55
Here's a video of Scott Adams that proves he knew Kanye wasn't referring to literal slavery prior to his clarifying Tweet:
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:26:28
Black people in 2018.
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:04:18
Yes. I also heard what he said immediately after that.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:53:04
That's not what he said. He said the victim mentality the black community still has over slavery is a choice:




@_date: 2018-05-03 00:33:00
How is it I understood what he meant before he came out with that Tweet while you didn't?
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:37:50
Ah yes, the "Cold Cosby".

If AT&amp;T wants to be retarded, they should be allowed to. Their customers will just go to another carrier. It's why I switched to T-Mobile.
And the government stands to gains even more from net neutrality. This isn't something I want to open the door for the government to be able to regulate.
The best solution would be to prevent municipalities from only allowing a handful of ISPs in their jurisdiction.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:27:03
That has never been a problem though. It's a solution to a problem that never existed.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:13:32
Right, because of government mandated local monopolies
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:54:37
Municipal governments set up the local monopolies, not the federal government.

The bad news is that you can only own up to four Bitcoin at the same time.
The good news as that any of them can have been mined nine years ago.

That's usually the connotation people have with Muslims and bombs.

I would love to help you out and take those off your hands :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:31:25
So then I'm going to be getting what the rate was when I started the process on Tuesday, correct? My wire didn't leave my bank until Wednesday so I'm trying to find out which rate I'll be getting.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:15:43
So you're experiencing the same thing? Is it with P2P or a wire? 
@_date: 2013-04-06 06:05:41
You sound like an asshole. Stop being such an asshole and people will be more likely to help you.

I'd love to hear his opinion on where he thinks bitcoin is going. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:01:41
Oh, so I'll receive the funds in USD and then convert them to BTC myself? Makes sense, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:25:27
Will do. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:07:45
I mean at what part of the transaction is the rate determined? When they receive the wire? The moment I initiate it? When it's credited?
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:23:02
What day did the funds leave your bank account? And for around what amount? I have about $2500 coming in so I'm hoping it's because it's a large amount. I also contacted them, here's what they said:
"We are waiting to hear back from the bank. As soon as they contact us, we will be able to resolve the wire deposit issue."
They also said it has affected all wires, but I'm not so sure about that if your funds already cleared.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:58:21
When did the funds leave your account? 
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:17:44
I would assume the massive volume of people trying to get in on the market.
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:44:54
Wires are typically pretty fast. Their site says the credit takes 1 business day. I would expect you to have it by the end of the week.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:56:35
Time to start buying copious amounts of water and canned goods. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:02:14
I just received a reply from them:


Any idea on when they determine the conversion rate?
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:10:24
You should be receiving it today. I had funds wired out yesterday and am waiting to receive them too. Maybe there's a delay due to volumes? Let me know if you get a response!
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:13:17
Have you received your funds from bitfloor yet? My 4/3 transfer still hasn't entered my account.
