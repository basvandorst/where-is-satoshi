Nope, they just understand asymmetry! And you should too as you benefited from it. 
You don't get paid for how many times you get it right, you get paid for how much you make when you get it right.
I work in finance btw, and often you see people who take the opposite side of what Thiel and co do. For example, they sell OTM options, and most of the time they make money, and then something big happens and they lose all their money and they say they got unlucky.
If you take good asymmetric bets, you're not lucky, you're just smart and understand how the world works!

Hyperinflation happens not because central banks want to kill a golden goose, but because they fuck things up. 
It may or may not happen. Just put a little bit away in case it does. History has shown it can happen in other places, and by the time everyone knows it will happen it's far too late.

If that were true, in the long run they would lose money. Thiel has been right on too many things to be considered 'just lucky'.
1) Founded Paypal
2) Founded Palantir
3) Founded Founders fund (one of Sillicon Valleys most successful VC funds)
4) You already mentioned facebook
And there's a lot lot more to this.

It’s a profitable company and has essentially a monopoly. Sure you can have moral misgivings about the company, but that’s different to investing.
The whole point of asymmetric bets like Facebook early is that the downside is low, the upside is huge.
And yes of course it’s the shining light of his investment portfolio. Facebook is the sixth most valuable company in the whole world. If it didn’t overshadow everything else then I’d be suspicious.
