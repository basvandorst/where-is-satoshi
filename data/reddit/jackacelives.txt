Actually one suggestion I didnt think about earlier. Options for miners to add coin without a price point involved. IE I mine .01BTC, I would like to add it to my portfolio but don't want it tied it as if i purchased it.

lmao did you really pre-order? If you did, you have gigantic balls to drop that much money on something that has a shady video that has been picked apart so hard for inaccuracies and no other proof of existence. 
that being said... I'll take all 5! ;)

No, ASIC and GPU mining are two different worlds. GPU's will have demand regardless of ASIC manufacturers.

Welcome to the party! Looks like you need to fund and open a channel, I believe. I'll be getting my Raspi running soon and join you!

Not that I am calling you a liar, but pics of withdrawals or transactions would be interesting to see.

at the very least in terms of efficiency, absolutely.

This is actually very nice. I love the UI and how easy and quick it is to see all the stats without feeling overly clunky. Will definitely continue to test and use this!

GMO is boasting 7nm chips, it won't be samsung supplying that.

Use something that has dynamic difficulty instead of calculators that are created on sites that SELL mining gear... their job is to make you want to buy them. mycryptobuddy has an excellent and realistic outlook on mining profitability. Of course it is also taking an estimate of difficulty increases over time and cant predict the future, but its way better than your current source.

There needs to be a sticky or PSA about fees being back to normal and what they actually are. Fees have been dropping to almost nothing again and these threads are still popping up daily about a $20 fee.
