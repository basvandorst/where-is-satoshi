Actually i was really loughting out loud

Gate.io worked for me today with bitcoin diamond 
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:00:39
Yes, bither and bitpie combo worked. Yesterday morning I've seen bither is updating itself so I checked for new forks immediately. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:36:47
gate.io worked for me, dumped today, feels good... 
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:54:51
Kinda like Q4 bitcoin moves. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:59:56
Yeah, last week I sent some donations to Andreas A. because his youtube speeches saved me to sell my coins during the depressing years after Mtgox. But I did it with my usual low fees so the transactions were stacked for a week... and were feeling super awkward. A day ago it get cleared… feels good now :)
@_date: 2018-09-28 02:04:37
Kinda true.
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:31:32
That's about right. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 09:54:13
He was saying: bla, bla, bla some multi company bullshit then again bla bla bla
They practicing this on meetings and presentations. Too bad that they blocked commanting.
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:11:38
Thats what I usually do. If I send more then ~1 BTC I usually send like 0,01 or less just to confirm that the adress is right. I can imagine this could be an automized feature for big BTC moves.

Not so sophisticated but grabs the essence. Reminds me of this from Mr Antonopoulos: "We don't know what regulators are going to ask for, but I think I know what my answer will be: no."
@_date: 2014-10-29 08:59:37
Yes, the age is an important factor. I'm 32 and have a wife and 3 kids. So that can explain why I'm not all in :). I'm into bitcoin since the cyprus crisis so gone throught the last november cycle completly. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 08:35:20
Yes I think getting into the crosshairs of the US should be the worst thing for bitcoin is such a situation.
@_date: 2014-09-04 08:13:43
Here is a good explanation of possible factors [video](
and a price modelling [page](
what I think is pretty detailed.
@_date: 2014-11-14 07:12:50
It should be good to see a book what is like "Bitcoin for Dummies". To get everybody able to understand this not so simple technolody.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:56:03
What a great project!
@_date: 2014-11-19 14:04:34
Inside the country (here in Hungary) it usually takes a few hours and within Europe it’s usually a day. But sending money from Hungary to the US is about 3-5 days.
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:36:30
Wow. Now this is a service. Just registeded and the transaction took like 2 minutes to complete. From the credit card to the BTC walleet.
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:02:04
yes, not a bad way I think
@_date: 2014-12-11 07:31:36
A really big news should be if Microsoft buys a BTC wallet company. Will see when this kind of deals should happen. Getting excited…
@_date: 2014-10-15 11:48:25
I think she just made a fool out of Mr Lawsky in front of Bloomberg TV with this. She did a lot of interviews on bitcoin and looks like have better and better understanding.

1.5 year, after the Cyprus crisis
@_date: 2014-12-11 07:55:58
This just made me laught so hard!
@_date: 2014-09-19 10:44:58
As time passing they have less and less chance to regulate.
@_date: 2014-10-03 13:21:32
Great job. I think The Hoarder pretty much describes me :)
@_date: 2014-12-19 12:38:23
Now this is gentlemen remittance!
@_date: 2014-09-11 13:58:09
There should be! Our company from Eastern Europe buying critical components from the US for example and the US companies only shipping when the prepaid amount is arrived to their account (pro forma invoice procedure). The time difference also doesn’t helps if you think about banking and sending money. So this procedure usually takes a week. So we losing time and money. With Bitcoin this should be 1-10 minutes…
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:24:12
This is GENTLEMOON.
@_date: 2014-11-14 10:07:18
This looks good. Thanks!

These British guys are smarter than most of the world central bank figures.

Another James D'Angelo video about cap and trade problems and how bitcoin can help to resolve transparency problems: 
[cap and trade](
But on my opinion it is very unlikely that big organizations (goverments, big companies) wants to be transparent…
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:15:43
Not in Hungary yet. Just tried.
@_date: 2014-12-02 13:17:41
This is a clear evidence that they fear bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:22:47
I think it's an excellent pitch and really good project but you should show this not only for citibank (because they interested in the opposite). Show it to some open minded people. Andreas Antonopoulos, Tim Draper, Pantera Capital, Bitpay, Circle... and the list goes on. Search at Angle List for some connection who seems to interest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-04 08:30:13
I think it should take years to build a system that replaces SWIFT. If they get banned out before it's established that can have a huge impact. But I think that’s unlikely to happen. Now the western countries only what to scare the investors more by having these kind of discussions.
@_date: 2015-05-19 06:35:01
Nice to see that the swedish ETN broke down the price at GBTC. Now they are not the only ones :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:24:31
There is a good possibility that by the time the car is finally sold the price should be back at 200$ :)

This should be most likely not the Winklewoss trust but the Berry Silbert second market OTC trade. Just my guess...

Piece of genius

Please don't do that. Water is dangerous!
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:52:43
Good point.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:58:22
This is a good lesson for everybody who invested more than a few salaries (like me) to learn risk management, human behavior and how vulnerable is the fiction called money in our society (digits on a ledger). 
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:21:14
Bought at 150, 600, 400, 300, and still buying.

You think it's pure gambing. That's fine. Time will tell us that it's more like gambling or investing. Be patient. I looking at it az a hight risk investing where I put 5% of my assets. So not so much. But you don't have to do anything about it. :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:22:21
Right now the fiat is real and practical in the US. But there are other countries and other times in history. Plus who knows what the future holds... Be open minded man.

Sense of humor is one of the most important thing in life. Especially situations like this :)
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:53:50
Thanks, now it makes sense.
@_date: 2015-01-12 07:20:21
Too bad that we can't comment this news on the FT front page :) but at least the trolls can't do it either.

Greed should develope the interest.
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:24:16
An interesting piece of this video when Barry Silbert says the Walls street money should come in within 3-6 months to bring liquidity and have huge impact on price. It’s that so close? When this interview has been made?

I use it first of all for investing but also for remittances once in every month. Sometimes trasferwise.com service for the same.

I used Bitfinex to dump the BCash for BTC today. Worked fine. However BCash confirmation took like a half day. They need 20 confirmation to accept the deposit.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:44:14
Well I kept some just in case. You know in cypto world...
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:19:43
Just wait until they learn the lesson about how difficult is to mine. Then they will realize that buying is easier, especially with printed government money...
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:30:40
I know, unfortunately I was on vacation :)
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:15:44
I remember the 411 days from 2013 november. Was depressing AF. :)

Same here. I was learning from gold certificates and derivatives to find risky investment for some portion of my savings to make money, and found bitcoin. Then I get pulled into the rabbit hole and started to learn.
@_date: 2015-08-12 09:41:33
95% bitcoin, then the rest can be altcoins
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:17:20
Please don't poke it. It will jump on your face.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:50:25
I remember those depressing years after the spike. Newer forget that pattern.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:17
Aaaand, it's gone. 
Might come back within an hour or so...

I have a spreadsheet to calculate my crypo gains. As i just type in the bitcoin price its already 10 USD higher. Crazy, crazy days.

This is some huge news for privacy fans. Like me :)
@_date: 2019-04-18 06:21:19
Checking in from europe. Using Bitstamp, Kraken and Bitfinex. All works just fine SEPA wire transfer is fast. Buying with debit card works at Bitstamp but fund it expensive so just using wire transfer.

I understand the concept and it is very much inline with my speculation but I have to admit that we are just speculating... 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:56:30
Yeah, this just reminded me to that long depressing period after mtgox. Not sure I can handle something like that again :) well will see 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:06:59
Now we are talking to get serious :)
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:39:28
There will be another forked coin with wallet software that I can use to dump their 2x coin? I made some good money in the summer with BCash.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:16:07
I just typed it in to my spreadsheet, then it dropped another 500 USD 
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:03:29
Just to say: "Hello I'm here to buy but nobody is selling so I can't". Or just to function as a notification them that the trading has begun.
@_date: 2015-04-14 07:07:09
I think the 10 BTC bids are just there to send them a message when the trading has begun.
@_date: 2018-07-01 13:44:00

So it is live now just nobody wants to sell? Even more interesting.
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:29:46
At least they picked a date :) not like GBTC.
