Bitcoin has never had a bull market.  Surely you don't consider a market manipulator pumping the price so he can dump it a bull market do you?   Have you ever seen bitcoin consistently rise for weeks or months?  Of course not, because it has no organic growth or true fundamentals.  All it does is go sideways, down, with very brief pumps so traders can profit.
If bitcoin wasn't a pump and dump scam we would see periods of sustained growth as well as sustained downward motion.  All we see is down down down down PUMP down down down.  Not indicative of a successful commodity/stock/currency/whatever it is.  Indicative of purely a speculative asset/pump and dump scheme.

is a 3 month old community that already has more subscribers than this sub got in its entire life time.  I looked at the top list of reddit subs, and there are tons of subs created last year that already trump this sub.  Bitcoin is so insignificant to the real world, it's comical to watch people in this sub think it's going places. 
They consistently lose traffic from month to month too.  Literally nobody cares about bitcoin.  I hate to break it to all of you bitcoiners here, but if your technology were acquiring new users, your traffic patterns would show continuous growth.  Not a loss of growth.  It's really as simple as that.

So it's the media's fault why bitcoin is failing?  How about the fact that it has no real world use cases and therefore no users or demand for coins?  Seems like that is more likely!

Because there is no financial incentive to do so.  Every time a company accepts bitcoin, it's followed by dismal sales figures.  It would cost Google more money to research how to implement it then they would even get in sales.  Why don't you go ask Overstock how their sales are doing?  Hint: they undershot by millions of dollars.

Yea well you should have used an escrow service that specializes in hat eating.  Sorry for your loss!

There's nowhere NEAR 8 million bitcoin users.  How is this post the top comment, does this community really believe that?  The federal reserve and Reuters independently estimate a whopping 100k users total - in the world!  Coinbase has 2 million WALLETS.  [90% of which are completely empty]( and most people own multiple wallets.  To say the entire bitcoin network has over one million users is a gross over estimate, let alone to say Coinbase has over a million users.
Have you ever stopped to think why the price is falling?  It's because nobody uses bitcoin and there's 0 demand for them.  Not because it's successful with millions of users.  If there were millions of users, there would be demand for coins, it's basic supply and demand.

Then why is it controlled by a handful of mining pools?

No but apparently 5 years is.
24 hours - down
1 week - down
1 month - down
6 month - down
12 month - down
But wait!  5 years is up guys, totes legit, invest now before it's too late.  Bitcoin is the best performing currency, ever.  Btw don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  HAHA WINK WINK!
Let's ignore the fact that the price only got that high because someone coded a bot to manipulate the market.  Nope that's not relevant at all, just load up that log chart and tune out of reality!

It's actually worse than that because they track multiple hops.  So if you buy bitcoin and then sell that bitcoin to someone who uses it for something illegal, they will ban you.  Not sure how many hops they track, [but it's enough to fuck you over for no reason](
For now Circle doesn't put the ban hammer down for petty shit like this.  Source: Circle -&gt; Agora transactions that haven't gotten me banned.

Ok?  And they said they were not spoiling the surprise, right?  And if you watch the Youtube video, it clearly does not imply bitcoin in any way shape or form.  Not by any stretch of the imagination.

Actually if merchants "accepted" bitcoin, then Bitpay wouldn't be responsible for selling all of the "accepted" bitcoins on an exchange and pushing the price down.  One of the factors of the falling price is because Microsoft, Newegg, etc DO NOT accept bitcoin.  If they accepted bitcoin, held bitcoin, and paid for goods and services in bitcoin, the price would stabilize.  The fact is anyone who "buys something with bitcoin" from a major retailer is just selling their coins on an exchange and buying stuff with real money, not bitcoin.

Even if that was an on chain transaction it wouldn't be counted as a measure of economic activity.  It's just noise.  Much like 95% (or more) of bitcoin's transactions per day are.  According to the above link and the [Federal Reserve report]( actual retail transactions being done with bitcoin are almost non existent.  The majority of transactions on this network are gambling related by a handful of websites.

This is semi-inaccurate.  The study only looks into obvious scams.  Meaning services that were obviously ponzis and scams to begin with.  It doesn't even begin to include Mt Gox, BFL, Neo &amp; Bee or any of the large scale scams.  However, [this study includes]( all of those, but unfortunately it's a year old.
Fun fact:  1 in 15 bitcoins in existence has been stolen as of a year ago.  I'm sure it's closer to 1 in 10 now.  So with that in mind, can you guys really sit here and tell me that despite 10-15% of all coins in existence being stolen, that there's not a problem with the protocol itself?  Does it really matter if it's a service or a protocol?  If it's not possible to build secure services, to me that means the protocol is inherently insecure.  You can debate semantics all you want, but an every day consumer doesn't care if "technically" the protocol is flawed, or every service that runs on it is flawed.  He won't be adopting bitcoin either way, your semantics are not relevant.

Why the hell would someone go through all the trouble of buying bitcoin just to read one article on the internet for pennies.  In what world would that help bitcoin with consumer adoption?
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:01:00
No it won't, and the fact that people keeping implying it is just desperate and sad.  McDonalds gave 0 indication they were accepting bitcoins and you guys have totally blown a "cute/corny" video out of proportion to meet your agenda.  Anything to pump the price though...
@_date: 2015-01-29 18:01:55


There's your answer.  Everyone is sitting and waiting.  Also it should be noted that this community has 0 understanding of economics.  They literally think holding will make their coins rise in value.  Honestly they genuinely believe that economic value comes from holding your money.  Despite the truth being 100% the opposite, and the tanking price and declining retail sales reflecting that, the mantra is repeated over and over.  
Btw just look at Bitpay and Overstock, no, nobody is spending coins.  [The real bitcoin economy is 100% stagnant.](
