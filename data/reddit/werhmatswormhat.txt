Yeah but you at least get some of that tree fiddy.

What's going on with LTC today? Getting crushed.

There's also a non-zero chance that you end up with nothing.

Well, sort of. All investments are a gamble in one way or the other. Stocks can go up or down, businesses can succeed or fail, houses can gain or lose value, etc. Short of just putting money in a savings account or into an index stock, any sort of investment is a gamble.

Ignore the racist troll, folks.

It's a sunk cost. Right now you have $4K. The fact that you once had 8K is irrelevant.

That seems super optimistic.

Bank transfers often take a long time in general. I think mine took about a week.

Well, your bitcoin is depreciating a heck of a lot faster than that. Again, I'm bullish on bitcoin, but it's a really bad idea to have more than you can afford to lose invested in it.

Yeah, I'm down.

I feel like most bulls are confident in it being high several months from now. It's not about where it is today or tomorrow.

You definitely shouldn't get another credit card for the purpose of being able to put more money into crypto.

I don’t think he’s smart enough to do this.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:08:01
Maybe, but it wouldn’t be consistent with what seems to be his motive in his past tweets.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:43:06
Yeah, that's my plan as well. I believe it in long term, but this isn't the time to buy. I just did the same with Lite.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:29:28
Bummed I missed our on Ripple, but not gonna make the mistake of chasing gains.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:25:28
So by this logic is LTC overvalued or undervalued?
