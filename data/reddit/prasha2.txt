According to me, choose between either Option 3 or 4 depending on how urgently do you need the transaction to complete.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:10:28
Umm it's a bit complicated. Basically there are around 100K pending BTC transactions in the mempool. This is partially due to the small block size and partially due to sudden increase in BTC popularity and usage. As a result, miner fees are pretty huge this past 2-3 months.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:12:21
To be frank, nobodies knows whether current price of BTC is a bubble or not. And I don't see a single day wherein BTC prices went down while BCH went up. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:31:30
Yes exactly. If more wallets support SegWit, the transaction fees would come down even further. Would be really great for the community.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:57:26
You are putting out baseless stuff. Tether in no way controls bitcoin's market price. Nobody knows what the price of btc is going to be in the next week.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:00:34
You forgot to take into account the miner's fee.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:33:37
Try blockchain.info/address/&lt;address&gt;
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:34:11
Lol what???
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:49:07
Lol how? How much tx fees did you put?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:56:57
Regarding coinbase, do you have any proof to back it up? I understand that they aren't adopting SegWit but that's not damaging BTC. BTC is too huge to by damaged by a single company.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:58:35
Yes they really are i.e. for the same fee, segwit takes pretty less time to get confirmed. We all should force big wallet companies to adopt SegWit as soon as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:28:03
Try blockchain.info
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:51:14
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:11:03
Basically the wallet has to support SegWit. If it doesn't, move your bitcoins to a wallet which does.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:46:09
Theoretically, Yes.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:53:51
Use preev.com
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:59:24
It can't be zero. But the fee will be a lot less than what we see currently.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:27:42
Yes it still applies. HODL till the transaction fees go all the way down.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:25:49
You still haven't. Invest a small amount which you can afford to lose. Then hold onto your BTC for at least a year.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:29:40
That's great news.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:34:30
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:42:11
But why?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:19:14
It has always been unreliable. Either go for blockchain.info or gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:29:33
Bcash has to succeed first for it to fail :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:10:06
Yeah, looks good. If it increases, good. If not, then you don't have much to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:11:53
They may be wrong, or they may be right. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:38:26
Blockchain.info allows you to transfer BCH exactly once to either your bitcoin or ethereum wallet
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:24:34
Move it to GDAX first and then send it to some other wallet for free :) Don't use bitfinex. Recently their actions look shady.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:00:02
I care about the tech. I want BTC to be a currency that's not government controlled, and at the same time, is super-fast and very secure. If BTC were to tackle its high transaction fees, it would be pretty good currency IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:40:52
Yes. It is bound to rise again soon.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:43:35
Suddenly, a lot of countries have started accepting it. There has been a surge of new wallets to capture the new population that wants BTC. All this is contributing to sudden surge in BTC prices.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:30:10
How much were you transferring? If your exchange allows it, please increase the transaction fee. Keep it around 10$ I would say. If the amount being moved is small, HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:18:32
Yeah but it is a bit saturated for sellers. Plus, most of the buyers tend to go with most-reputed sellers.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:58:56
Lol, you literally don't know what net neutrality stands for.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:18:05
The problem is newbies end up buying bcash since they just see bitcoin in the name and consider it to be the actual one. Also domains like bitcoin.com aren't helping here by forcefully advertising bcash alongside bitcoin, causing more confusion.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:48:58
Use blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:39:13
If you are on coinbase, transfer to GDAX and then send it to a SegWit address for free.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:50:01
There is no fee for consumers when transacting with GDAX. The confirmation will take a little long though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:28:23
You should be very careful when investing such a large amount at this time. Do it only if you want to hold it for long and don't mind some loss on it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:23
I too use preev.com
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:24:29
This is very comforting.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:10:25
I think BCH would be a good altcoin if Roger wasn't the face of it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:21:31
I didn't downvote you.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:16:18
Lol, I dodged a bullet. I was always very interested in Bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:03:21
What's Steem Blockchain. How is it getting used here?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:23:18
Set a very small fee if you can wait about 20 hours to get the transaction confirmed on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:41:12
Keep it simple. Move to blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:47:14
All you can do is wait. Wait for the transaction fees to go considerably down. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:35:58
Do not go for Bitfinex. They have been acting very shady recently. Go for blockchain.info - simple to use.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:49:13
The confirmation should happen soon.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:19:45
I think the terms "bubble" and "groundbreaking technology" are orthogonal to me. One cannot deny that Bitcoin is a groundbreaking tech, but at the same time, the current phase of btc growth can very well be termed a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:54:47
Don't transfer unless it is a large amount.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:28:24
Not worth it at all.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:23:34
Go for either coinbase or localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:58:21
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I thought you were questioning BTC than CryptoCurrency in general.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:38:41
I think so. For me, 11K is an inflated value of BTC. Expect it to go down within a week or so.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:50:38
How much transaction fee did you put? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:14:41
Not a place to sell, mate.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:18:46
Thanks for the update guys.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:08:35
Not worth it with the amount of ads thrown on screen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:07
Not worth it. Yes, mining will considerably reduce your laptop's life. And you won't mine much.
If you are really interested in mining, go for antminers which are built with a specific purpose of solving BTC hash problems.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:52:00
Sadly, yes. Go for blockchain.info where you have control over the transaction fees you set.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:50:12
Since you are only getting started, start with an amount which you can afford to lose. Analyse the growth overtime and increase investment. And don't worry about dips, they are temporary.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:02:29
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:45:34
DO NOT DO IT. Don't be a fool.
Invest an amount that you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:32:48
Which coin has resolved the issue? If you think BCH has resolved it, you are totally wrong. BCH has simply upgraded the blocksize to 8MB. If this blocksize too starts filling, they would have to do another hardfork. This is not called solving the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:40
BTC has always been there.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:59:05
Yes, developers are definitely working towards this problem. They are working on introducing Lightning Network. But it will take another 18 months to roll out.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:07:41
Do it through GDAX. There is no cheaper way than that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:26:34
No, they are not lost. Which wallet did you use to transact? Does it allow modifying the fee? If yes, increase it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:48:08
No, it is not late at all. Bitcoin has just gotten started. Buy some and HODL. And don't worry about occassional dips.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:16:11
Nice :)
