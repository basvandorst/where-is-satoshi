Dumb question and this may seem out of left field, but here it goes...
So my understanding, the coins (BTC) live on the blockchain, it's the keys that we attain. So the 4 mill aren't coins, they're keys...
So, can the coder and along with everyone else agreeing on the blockchain, write a code to reissue very VERY long unused coins? We all can tell what coins are moving from the blockchain.
Let's say, for a certain coin on btc. If we can all agree that if a coin have 0 movement for 75 years, they'll be a world wide warning (for 5 years) to at least move, tag, indicate, whatever that coin or it be issue back to the exchange.
This will help with inflation. That's the problem with fiat. Let's say Mike been stashing cash in a hiding place or a safe for many years and now he died.. Whether it was $10 or $10 million, that fiat will never be seen in circulation again. And now you X's that by a million people.. You get my point..
The beauty about the blockchain we are able to always see each and every coin!

Your first mistake was telling her there could be a plan to cash out.. Yes, 2nd it's an investment but 1st it's the new age money.. Meaning, the only time you plan to use it is where you can actually use it.
I'm starting to get a feeling you and a lot of other people are getting the wrong idea of what internet really is.
You want to invest on an investment. Do index stocks. Bitcoin was never intended to be a get rich scheme

First off, getting with your family for Christmas and talking about bitcoin is like talking about politics when it comes to investing.. Nothing exciting.. "hey Uncle Jerry, did you see that big surge on the 13th?!".. Let's just be honest, fucking boring especially talking about on Christmas day.
If you're going to talk about anything, just talk about the technology about bitcoin.. How it's the internet of money.. Talk about the blockchain.
Overall, just tell them you have absolutely no control in what the markets did and you have no idea where the markets are going.

Great comment. Also, I have a question that goes along part of what you're saying &amp; asking.
So let's say we are living in a bitcoin economy, but we're still comparing BTC to fiat (USD etc etc) and I ask my friend to borrow 0.004682 BTC. He says and sees 0.004682 BTC is about $300 USD and he tells the borrower to just work a week moving boxes in his warehouse. But with a matter of a day when borrowing this amount, the 0.004682 BTC is now worth $600 USD and the leader tells the borrower that now you have to work 2 weeks since it of the increased value. And vice versa, the 0.004682 BTC amount changed to $150 a day after borrowing and he can't see himself work a week moving boxes for only $150

I am but he's for every living human being on earth right now. It's not just catering his work to bitcoin community people but his informing every living human being about the destruction of fiat/banks.
Yes his actual work is with bitcoin, but just like that blockchain, ANYONE can access and gain the experience of bitcoin

Honest question.. But how would you like CB to introduce BCH to be on their platform? 
1 year notice? Leaving everyone knowingly that BCH going to hit CB and leaving a lot of other alts with a little attention to a point not worth buy with BTC..
6 month notice? Leaving just enough time for the opposition party to do a smear campaign, crazy high surge in the price of BCH with super high expectations and again, leaving other alts dry for 6 months, and today's world if you're not relevant you're dead in the water.
Or 1 weeks? Having everyone go fucking ape shit, selling their homes, depleting their kids college funds etc etc because we all just seen wtf happened with BTC and somewhat or ETH and a little of LTC spikes all because being on CB (just super fucking easy to get crypto)
The answer is; there is no good time to intro a new crypto  to CB. Crypto is not nor ever been regulated leaving private companies (like CB) to pretty much do what they want, when they want.

Welcome to the stock market.. People want to pretend to play the day trade game, checking every second on trade view. 
Relax. HODL. and understand nobody got rich over night.
