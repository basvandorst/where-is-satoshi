Personally, I cannot wait for the day when Bitcoin or LTC is accepted as an everyday currency.  This way I can do away with credit cards and government and corporations tracking this part of my life.  I wish I could pay cash for everything, but simply it is not quite feasible.

Plain and simple this was irresponsible reporting.  This lady found a target that could fit her agenda and convinced Newsweek to run with it without actually any solid evidence.
Ask yourself this, with all the facts that were put into place here, would a jury of our peers agree who his man is accused of being?
This journalist portrayed people who have no contact with this person or very little, claims he has been invisible during certain time periods - no concrete evidence of anything - claims he is a very intelligent man who has similar names as the person in question here - yet nothing that actually says he is this person.
I would hope that this irresponsible person who now has changed the life a man who did nothing wrong and who did not ask for this would be removed from reporting all together.  I would be embarrassed if this type of person worked for my company.

parks are part of nature....the usps charges a tax on ever letter sent out.  i have always went to private schooling - probably why i realize how poorly money is used.  libraries were useful before the internet - now they are a waste of money.
don't get me wrong, government has its place, but it is failing us pretty badly right now.  more and more failures and poor decisions.

I call for a complete ban of politicians lying and misusing my tax paying dollar.

I am biased.  I have been a reader for more than two decades.
You are biased, you are a journalist paid to produce results to attract readers.
get it now?

what is the best way now to buy bitcoins in the US since Bitinstant and MTGox have shutdown operations?

everyday i pay taxes.  i just give the government money for nothing they have earned or assisted me with.  i have potholes up and down my street.  i cut the grass that is considered city property and then pay them extra tax for it.  if they want to lock me up for not paying tax on bitcoin, they will be missing out on a lot more tax that they already are taking advantage of.

big brother must work for reddit....
people here have had millions of dollars stolen from them and cannot do anything about it - yes it is risk - but big brother says no sir you can discuss and bring evidence to the table.

Thank you for your classy and respectable post.
I am also in my mid -30's and have spent my life in the IT world.  I am a problem solver.  Sadly, when something goes wrong, I am generally the person people blame.  I get it and I quit letting that bother me quite some time ago.
Back to the original thought and your post.  "journalism is about leveraging objectivity and pursuing the truth".  This is correct and you have been taught well.  However, this story really didn't present the truth.  Instead, there was an agenda here, to find the lochness monster, to find big foot, to find a ghost who to be honest, most will tell you that we like him being a ghost.  He contributed to our world something so big that nobody even understands right now how big this is.
Being a man who has traveled the world and met some of the most intelligent people, I can tell you this - there is one thing that sets all apart - language barriers.  The media in this world control human thought - unless you start learning other languages and communicating with other cultures, your image of these culture will remain the same.  Also, these cultures will never share ideas.  
The other biggest barrier is currency - the wealthy control the currency in this world.  When the currency is controlled, then people are controlled.  Again, media controls people, wealthy control currency, wealth controls the media.
Everyone in this world has an agenda and will always defend for themselves.  Reporting is no different.
This woman who reported this story ruined a persons life because she knew how big this is and it is just waiting for a story like this - the evidence was not overwhelming - just all hearsay.  If she tied a bitcoin to him, people may believe a little more.  Good luck with finding physical evidence as a ghost.  You want to be like her?  Claim you found DB Cooper.

I ask you please stand up in front of the committee and ask them why they choose to hold back technology when technology is ready to grow.  This government encourages companies like Visa and Mastercard.  But they do not appreciate the electronic currency which is extremely safe and well accepted around the world.
