@_date: 2014-04-09 00:43:57
it would get rough. and the headlines lol
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:43:17
I agree, I think bitcoin could be described a little better with the information on it today.

am i late to the party?
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:13:39
yeah I got the same email as well, not liking the sound of this :|
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:59:38
yeah, but I think a fraction missing from a coin would be more appealing to a regular consumer rather than having a balance of.93456 ect
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:12:41
Nice, Bear and Birch sauna over in freehold accepts bitcoin as well. Great place too.

my exact feeling. I dont see this as a big deal at all. I mean cool they accept it but merchants wont give two shits or receive the benefits of bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-18 20:12:47
Dont see your reasoning for "the coin". If bitcoin is successful you're guaranteed to see other cryptos follow in its path.
Frankly, its scary to invest in even a single Bitcoin due to fear of being hacked and just by being a complete tech idiot. buying litecoins on the other hand makes it  less scary and gives people the chance to play around with it. Yes you can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin but owning a full coin is much more satisfying than having .0035 or something like that in your wallet.
Not saying you're wrong about a pump and dump, but there is good Houbi that could bring Litecoin up nicely
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:59:29
Good luck to you fellas, lets hope its resolved sooner then later!

well surprised or not, NB has balls to do something like this on a technology thats only been out for a 5 years~. Others are just sitting on the sidelines and watching the events unfold.

@_date: 2014-02-26 17:04:10
For security. People are afraid to dabble in bit coin due to volatility, theft and a small understanding of bitcoin. What NeoBee is doing is great. Gives customers a choice to ride the volatile waves or do a time lock where if 1000$ is put in your account. You're guaranteed to take that 1000 even if the bitcoin price falls. I honestly believe Neo and Bee will have a big impact in Cyprus.
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:40:27
how are you paying for gas. and where are you starting from?
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:43:56
I know, my childish side came out, what can I do. NeoBee is playing out very well I think, especially on timing and location. I've invested in NB a while back and plan on buying some more.

They are hoping to gain the majority of customers for these p2p payments before bitcoin grows even larger. Who shall prevail?!?!
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:55:22
what if they cant afford more bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:28:59
agreed, but litecoin can be more of a serious investment as well.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:31:23
nice, sounds interesting. but why coinflow? if its a social network why not go with FreeFlow or something that is related to decentralisation and privacy.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:56:00
just out of curiousity, do you mine bitcoins or litecoins?
@_date: 2014-02-08 00:42:05
yay? bitcoins are still falling on price, so who gives a shit.

how are the coins created if there is no mining?
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:34:23
again, not for your regular Joe. i've been asking people daily wether they know about bitcoin and their opinions on it and i always get responses such as its to confusing or what they have been hearing from the MS news sources.
Its kind of simple, what apple did with their e-books. you can turn pages and bend them, just like a real book. well right now you look in your wallet to see how much cash you have. A portrayed bitcoin picture would give a similar feel and less of a worry to figure out the math behind it all. the $ value can still be there and the value of that spent coin can also still be there.

More and more bad news. It's not looking good in the near future IMO. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:07:03
you have to purchase bitcoin from them, you cant transfer your own it seems, doesnt seem to appealing.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:14:42
So this just reinforces bit coin in a way. Laundering will get you caught, making it more stable? Thanks US Gov! 
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:42:39
most definitely another pump and dump.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:02:37

@_date: 2014-01-26 16:52:08
the goal of bitcoin is to become adopted by the masses though, and bitcoin and bitpay are out there trying their best to do that, but seeing digital coins instead of numbers would be more appealing and easier to use and understand.

@_date: 2014-03-24 20:55:47
I dont see why this is a big deal, Gyft IMO doesnt really do much for bitcoin. You're purchasing cash on a card for bitcoin. So wal-mart is not accepting or testing the waters, there are simply just accepting cash.

@_date: 2014-03-02 04:09:26
could be the right choice, been following bitcoin only for about 3 months now and after the 1200~ high, we've been in a slowwww decline :|. im a supporter and all but just saying what I see :|
P.S I do plan on holding though, im in it loss or boom.
@_date: 2014-10-17 14:34:01
Atleast they are allowing withdrawals on mintpal now 
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:54:17

Could anybody explain how theres value in a Factoid? From what i understand, they are not using the Bitcoin blockchain, instead creating their own alt coin. I understand how tje project works but wheres the value come from?
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:07:41
what does the final balance mean?
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:43:55
Well with bitcoin you probably have to initiate the transaction each time, copy paste address or scan qr code. its a bit easier to just say yes and have your CC charged. I'm sure this could be easily fixed though and probably will as we progress with bitcoin. That being said, o'm loving the idea of Magic, I see some great potential in this!
@_date: 2015-03-05 01:30:28
how is volatility addressed?
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:29:21
Hmm. Noob here. Would browsing data be originated from the provider? So if you put your network out there for people to use, and its used for ilicit purposes, couldnt that come back to the provider?

@_date: 2013-12-09 01:21:28
ah thanks, woulda been cool for a tourney ;p
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:07:18
if they dont care about saving good amounts of money then thats not a good business plan.
Good for Lambo though, hope some purchases go through!

@_date: 2013-12-07 22:02:56
just checked out your website, don't see any information about it, same with Facebook. If this is really happening with your dealer that's great, would like to stay informed of how it goes. I work with a bunch of managers at dealers and I was also considering talking to them about it.
