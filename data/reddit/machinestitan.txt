It's at $145 and losing.

Yup, $137 now.  I'm sure it will stabilize lower than it was a few weeks ago (~$100).

That logic does not make ANY sense.  Just because MTGOX is on hold does not mean that it will act independently of the other markets.  If the other markets go up, then cool, MTGOX will too.  But if I can buy BTC @ $80 on Bitfloor and then sell for $120 on MTGOX, that's going to drive the price down.  It will stabilize and average based on the other markets.  IT WILL NOT act indenpendently.  Econ 101.

$145 at the moment.

Look at the other Bitcoin markets; down to $80.  You think MTGOX will skyrocket when everyone else is down?  Delusional.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:09:15
That's now only worth $130, grats!

You said, "It's hard to say" implying the outlook could be good or could be bad.  I'm saying it's definitely going to be bad.  They're trading at $60/per on other markets right now.  Best case scenario, they stabilize half-way between $120 and $60.  More than likely though MTGOX will drop substantially to meet the lower prices of the other markets.
It's not hard to say at all what will happen.  People are going to lose big once MTGOX opens back up.  Fact.

You're a big person to admit that. Thank you for some sanity on this board.

If you were watching it live, you would have seen it peak around $200, stabilize around $190 for about 30 minutes, and now it's tanking hard. $130 as of this typing.

Enjoy buying your buttcoins.

It's already down lower; $149 as I type this.

If you have USD, then you can buy whatever you want.  BTC has nothing on USD, except maybe for drugs.  And if you're honestly wanting to buy so you can grab some drugs, stay out of this shit until it has stopped being so volatile.  No one is going to want to take your BTC's when the value can drop in an hour so substantially.

The real advice here is DON'T.
- Don't buy because you don't understand it.
- Don't buy because it's going to crash more.
- Do your research, learn about Bitcoin, and wait for $10 to buy in again if you want.  IF YOU WANT.
I would stay the fuck away from Bitcoin though.

Insanely unstable at the moment.
