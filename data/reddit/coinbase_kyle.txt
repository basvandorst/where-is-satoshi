We had an issue earlier today where transactions *from* Coinbase were not being broadcast to the network in a timely manner. It's since been resolved. We do apologize if it caused you any inconvenience.

The Bitcoin network itself was keeping up with transactions pretty well yesterday, so this is likely our fault - we had a delay with outgoing bitcoin transactions yesterday. We're back up 100% now without any delays. Our apologies for that!

While Coinbase is a hosted wallet service, we do give our users the ability to take control of their own private keys through the use of our Multi-Sig Vault feature. For more on this **advanced** option: 
If you use a multisig vault, then you can:
- Restore your coins without the need for the Coinbase website, if you wish or need that.
- Be assured that Coinbase cannot access your funds in the multisig vault without the shared key.
For more on our security practices and storage methods for our users who *do not* hold their finds in our multisig vault: 
Oh course, you're under no obligation to store funds with us, and we do not charge for nor do we have limits on the amount of bitcoin that you can send to or send from your Coinbase wallet. We do feel that our security practices are at a level higher than what the average person new to bitcoin would be able to duplicate. 
That being said, we do give as much choice to our customers as possible while trying to be as user-friendly as possible at the same time. 
It's a tough balance which we're always wiling to re-evaluate, so thanks for your feedback!

You may be selling bitcoin while others are buying bitcoin.  On the flip side, you may buy and others are selling. We act as a brokerage between the buyers and the sellers.

You can send from Coinbase to any external bitcoin address, so it doesn't matter if the merchant isn't a Coinbase merchant. 
In addition to paying it from the Coinbase website, you can also use our mobile app to scan the QR code that is generated by the merchant to make a payment.

The surface of the moon has 9,383,748,198 acres (it's true, I googled it).
The number of bitcoins that will ever be mined is near 21,000,000.
If the bitcoin blockchain represented moon real estate ownership, then each bitcoin represents 446.85 lunar acres. So let's say you own 21 bitcoin - you'd own 9,383.75 acres on the moon, or 37.97 square kilometers.
Since there are currently only 15.2 million bitcoins in circulation, that means that while over half of the moon is already claimed, about 2.6 billion acres on the moon has yet to be opened for settlement.

You mentioned in another comment that your TXID is 1a62538be1c35966e954e7867672f98387d0eee4a0e703db4196d1a98c64fb4d
Looks like there are plenty of confirmations on that. Have you reached out to Bither support? I would suggest using that TXID in your correspondence with them. That's public proof that your coins left Coinbase and confirmed to your address on the blockchain.

I am very sorry that you have waited for several days without a response. 
Please allow us to explain that while we can monitor and respond to posts on Reddit, and search for any resolve *most* issues, the support staff you see responding can't *always* help you directly with every issue. In many instances, cases that we find here on Reddit must be escalated to either a subject specialist or a supervisor. In those instances, how much help we can *personally* give you is, unfortunately, limited. 
Would also like to mention that Coinbase staff accounts do not upvote or downvote posts or comments as a matter of policy.

We use Authy for all of our 2FA services. So if you've ever gotten a text message to log in in the past, it was from Authy. So they *do* know that your old number was previously used to log in to Coinbase.
If you visit  to change your number, you can click the button at the bottom which says "I don't have access to my phone" if that's the case. 
This process is reviewed and complete by Authy, not us. However, if you need any further help on *our* end, please reach out to us at support+reddit

At this time of this comment, there are currently over 40,000 transaction in mempool. This is the "queue" of transaction waiting to be confirmed and put in a block. 
To put that in perspective, there are typically less than 5,000 transactions in the mempool at any given time. 
While we've seen unconfirmed transaction volume spike like this before, it's fairly rare on the network (for now). We can't really offer a time frame as to when your transaction will confirm, as it is in the hands of the bitcoin network, but we *do* raise the network fee we pay on your behalf in times of high volume.

We definitely haven't stopped processing transactions, but I can confirm that we are experiencing significant ACH delays due to extremely high volume. This has affected mostly deposits and buy orders.
