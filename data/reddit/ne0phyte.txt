It's not about the money. It's about Zynga buying a competitor and then shutting it down.

You guys can go f*ck yourself. Why didn't you at least let OMGPOP buy their site back? Stuff like that leaves a bad taste. Buying competitors just to shut them down is a really cheap practice.
I'm definitely no casual gamer but OMGPOP had some fun games compared to Zyngas *Ville stuff.

Works again.

Most people make fun of or ignore things they don't understand.
Or it's my serious response to the *funny* turbo cheater post.

Yes. It doesn't necessarily have to be 4 characters or exactly like this but there should be some kind of separation.
I wouldn't use such an intense color, maybe more like grey/light grey or a grey/black combination.

Or those are high frequency trading bots that aim to a) manipulate the price or b) make tiny profits.
But you are right, many tiny transactions drive the lag up which causes chaos.
EDIT: Here is a screenshot that shows a series of those small transactions

Hitting F5 all the time with the overhead of event handling and the browser doing a lot of stuff internally is complete bullshit.
A tiny C/C++/Java/Perl/Javascript/Python/whatever-you-want-to-use program can send way more HTTP requests with a valid header that looks like a browser (user-agent, cookie, referer, charset, encoding, language and so on).
You could also send tons of random cookies and many header fields with garbage to create more load.

Reading one long string (the address) is only easy for machines - think of serial numbers which are almost always split up into blocks. 
Maybe make space separated groups of 4 chars? Or make even groups black and odd groups grey?

I just bought my very first 3 BTC at $140 (on a German site in EUR not USD, though).
Seeing it rise again right now makes me smile. I really hope it was worth it :)

I'm sure people will buy in before that happens.

Can you link a source that can prove that it was a DDoS?

Why do you reload the whole page?
I would fetch the live stats from the mtgox API or which ever you want to use client side using JS and Ajax.
That way you have very little traffic and load on your side and the client can get updates every few seconds if not instant.

1.) Get the price down within a few minutes
2.) Buy BTC for 10k
3.) Raise the price by 5 or 10
4.) Sell and make 1.5k profit
5.) Repeat

At least they only charge $0.014/pixel at the current price.
That seems far more reasonable that $1/pixel.

Same here. Can't login and the password recovery mail doesn't seem to come any time soon.
Been using mtgox.com on my linux machine at home only so chance of a compromised system is rather low.
Let's hope for the best.

I don't have an opinion on that, but talking about "the DDoS" is misleading until the big BTC exchange sites confirm it.

Next time check the new submissions first.

I wanted to get some for a long time but I was unsure when to buy. The massive drop seemed to be worth the risk because the possible loss is smaller.
We'll see...
