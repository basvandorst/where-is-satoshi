Has anybody had any success using Dwolla again?  Or is that road shut for good?

You know you're on reddit, right?  This is what reddit does.  It reddits.

I'm a bit confused - somebody making up their mind about bitcoin being groundbreaking or not doesn't really affect how the media affects the masses to purchase the new shiny thing, which is what affects the valuation, so I'm not so sure total disregard of what is happening in the media is a thing anybody can afford to do..

It's sort of obnoxious and pedantic to assume that correct investment methodology means that you are prepared to lose 50 percent of your investment.

Your name
Your name is controversial and then throwaway numbers
This is your first post
Do you not get how this works?  This subreddit is usually rife with painfully obvious trading signals, but they usually don't go around trying to distance themselves from the idea of a trading signal in english by saying it isn't their native language.  YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR ENGLISH MORE CONVINCINGLY BAD IF YOU ARE GOING TO THIS.

You don't need to tell us that you are good at math either.  Looks like we are all in the wrong :C
Bitcoin, strictly speaking, is not an investment the way you are using it, since you aren't investing in anything.  It's a speculative instrument with generally shitty liquidity that behaves sort of like if penny stocks had no baked in valuation because most of the positions are held by people who aren't sitting at Bloomberg terminals learning about what the Winklevi just did, therefore the arb shifts are exciting nightmares.  There's no actual answers to this question because there's no valuation metrics because there's no set of ten thousand portfolio managers with risk formulas and 100mm balance sheets determining its values.  It's people with a lot of canned goods and Ron Paul bumper stickers guessing.

I don't really see what any of these have to do with a crash - by which I mean a massive dip in USD valuation.  These are more reasons that people would not want to adopt it as a currency, not why investors wouldn't want it is a commodity, which is currently why the price is blasting through the roof.
