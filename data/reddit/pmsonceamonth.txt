I made a 700 USD withdrawal the day before it went down and got it the day of then going down. I then withdrew ~2.5k and i have still yet to get it. it's been 7 day since I messaged both local till and bitfloor support and have yet to get a response. Not sure what else I can do but email them again. perhaps reddit upvotes would help:
"Dear Bitfloor &amp; localtill Support,
After the termination of Bitfloor's service, I requested an ACH withdrawal of approximately $2546.32 USD  I made this request the day of the news of bitfloor coming to an end, but I still have no received this money. I was wondering if you could tell me how much longer this would take. On bitfloor it shows as pending... Is there any reason why its not processed yet? Thank you for your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon."
I'm about to send them another message, this time a little more irritated..

So... you still haven't gotten that money? I managed to deposit a 2 loads in 1 day. and then deposited 2 additional loads an hr away from those previous 2. I haven't gotten any confirmation from the last 2 yet and am starting to worry. Hopefully you did get your money by now bc i'm freaking out.

Have you still not gotten your money?
So i'm having a similar issue. I withdrew $700 a few days before bitfloor crashed and I managed to get that money out. However, the day before it crashed, I pulled out $2500 and have yet to hear any response from either bitfloor or localtill support. Is anyone having a similar issue? Here was my first response to them:
"Dear Bitfloor &amp; localtill Support,
After the termination of Bitfloor's service, I requested an ACH withdrawal of approximately $2546.32 USD  I made this request the day of the news of bitfloor coming to an end, but I still have no received this money. I was wondering if you could tell me how much longer this would take. On bitfloor it shows as pending... Is there any reason why its not processed yet? Thank you for your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon."
I then messaged them again about a week later and have still not received any kind of update or response. Hopefully people can upvote this.

You have noooo idea how relieved I am to hear about this. opened a ticket with bitfloor and probably should to localtill. I deposited it at 430pm EST and its been 1.5 hrs... Currently freaking out, but knowing that you got your money has helped.
