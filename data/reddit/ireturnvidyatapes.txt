Sorry, it's 94% out of 152 reviews. This is their website...
And this is their Amazon.ca page
I'm not sure if programming your own words is legit. I've never heard of that before. Sounds too good to be true. It definitley wasn't used or refurbished. It came with that card asking "Did you notice". I'm just not sure if they're a licensed re-seller.

I just checked and they are indeed listed. Thank goodness. I'm not sure why I never thought to check the site. Seems like common sense.
I'll have to do more research into the custom password though. Anyway, thanks for the replies.

Major thanks for the information guys. Just wanted to confirm.

Depending on how much you need to maintain a comfortable life, you can get class B RVs that come equipped with showers and plumbing, you just need to worry about emptying it out when the tanks get full.
Personally, if I were to ever take on something like that, I would ditch some moderate comfort to just get a nationwide gym membership for showers and washroom facilities. That's what a lot of these people do. Just for the sake of not having to empty tanks every week. They still outfit them with heaters, solar panels, kitchenettes, composting toilets, and TV antennas if they wish. They have everything they need, just within the radius of a parking space. Some even get really clever and install rain collection systems so they don't even need to fill up their water tanks every week. 
No it's not for everyone, but for the people it's for, they seem to be a lot happier not having to worry about utility bills and property tax and rent and hydro every month. You have to cut down on some comforts in exchange for less stress.
Also, not everyone does it to travel either, which is something a lot of people associate with vanlife. Many just dwell within their cities and pay for a mailbox membership.

Meanwhile, I'm following a subreddit about people who have sold their homes, apartments, assets and investments to move into vans. As in, cargo vans, camper vans, etc. They consistently emphasize how happy they are no longer needing to worry about "grid life". 
The human race made it through a hundred thousand years without money. The Inuit have nothing other than ice and whale blubber to their name and they don't seem to be in a sweat to join modern society. 
I think we get too caught up in worrying about the future that we never enjoy the present.

What happens if you make a profit but the funds remain in your exchange without actually withdrawing them to your bank account?

All those early adopters sitting pretty on their thrones and laughing at us. Why or why were we not willing to let go of that morning coffee just that once?

I mean I CAN lose all of it and it wouldn't make a difference financially to me. But ideally, I would LIKE to not risk more than maybe 3k? It's kind of a blur. Not really sure what would be an ideal number.

Uncanny. I was just on the toilet contemplating dumping my entire savings account into it. I could survive homelessness for 5 years right?

I'm not going to lie, I would feel terrible, but I'm already beating myself up for not investing so much as a single dollar back in 2011.

They don't just live in their vans just to travel. Many do, to save on accommodation wherever they go, but a lot just stay in their city and don't feel the need to travel at all. For them it';s just about living a cheaper life. Vancouver for example is the most expensive city in North America. It's no wonder you see RVs and campers parked pretty much everywhere you go in the city. Would you rather dish out 3k a month just in rent for a bachelor apartment, or spend $800 a month on your total monthly expenses?

I'm worried that the time I spend waiting for a major dip, it would have skyrocketed so high that the next dip would have been the equivalent of what the current price is now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:44:28
What would constitute a low dip? Right now it's nearing 15k in Canadian dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:03:05
I felt that's about right. Thanks.
