If anything the in game money and cash vouchers sound redundant in a scenario where bitcoin is more prevalent. I guess until then it's worth the added hassle of creating an entire economic engine for said game than to just conduct transactions using the same currency people buy gas and food with.

good question. i say the sky's the limit in games like eve. dont seed the game and just have all the people who want to transfer in a boat load of wealth to their in game addresses (1 per ship and base, etc...  they do get blown up after all)... hrm There's also the introduction of currency via quest rewards and drops and as outside users pour money into the game you can deflate it with repair costs, money sinks, etc. If your game needs it the other direction, start rewarding more in an xpac. all transactions should have a 15% house fee instead of trying to have a centrally managed economy (just ignore it) in cases where users are storing millions in their in game addresses. those are some high quality "art assets" and "cloud services" people would be paying for???

yes, but since you buy the game for say 0.05 BTC, that covers the game and starts you with say 0.000001 in game or 1 game base credit? you can input or withdrawl to any bitcoin wallet at any time, yea

require 2 factor authentication and don't store any private keys in the game. at all, for any reason. users generate their addresses and put the public address only.
I didn't realize it, but i like this feature the best. game company is offering a game that costs bitcoin, redeposits a small fraction of the cost in an address the user chooses when the game starts and that's where the gaming company's interaction with it's economy ends other than pushing transaction api calls to a partner exchange such as coinbase...
must ponder.

maybe, but what if the game company never accepts cash from client? all bitcoin game purchase and in game currency. say, you pay 0.1 btc for a 1 yr subscription and that starts you with 0.000001 or 1g or 1uBTC in game? Micro transactions too
