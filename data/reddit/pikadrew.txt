Impossible to say. Releases often contain more than one merge request, look at the changes in 0.15.0 from 0.14.X:
There's a lot in there, so I'd expect a lot to be in 0.16.0 when it comes. Keep an eye on the repo tags for a release candidate, then you know it's in the pipeline.

It's not that I need fiat, but the wholesaler converts the BTC to fiat. So it has to convert correctly. The wholesaler says it's $10, I sell at $11, by the time they open for business and I give them the $11 worth of BTC it's only worth $9 so I've made a loss instead of a profit. So I plan to use the exchanges to covert to fiat and convert back when I need the BTC. That way I sell $11 of BTC and hold the fiat in my exchange account, then buy $11 of BTC on the Monday morning. I pay a percentage of course but I can plan for it and it's not as volatile. I still use BTC to pay my wholesaler, at no point to I ever really hold fiat.
@_date: 2014-06-13 10:56:58
So the funds get locked when you pledge? It's not possible to have them all pledge and when the sum of pledges that are available could make the pledge a reality it would then take their funds? So someone with 0.01BTC could pledge on 2 dares, and the first to actually have enough to pay the pledge gets the coins?

They're only open during regular business hours and they do their bitcoin conversion at their convenience. They're very private about it but it seems like they're using an exchange. They won't accept payment in any way other than to their account which they then convert at their convenience.

I sell a product for the BTC equivalent of $11, for which I owe the wholesaler $10. Let's say I got paid 0.018490 BTC as an example.
It's Friday night when I get paid that. On Monday when I have to settle with the retailer they expect to be paid $10, and they'll let me pay in bitcoin. I have 0.018490 but because of price changes it's now only worth $9.
This is why I was planning to use an exchange to negate that.
If BitPay don't negate it then I'm better off taking the BTC myself so I can instantly put it on an exchange to negate the volatility. If there's a payment provider who do instant BTC settlement rather than daily settlement like BitPay that would also be a good option for me. Do you know of one?

I looked at bitpay's payment page and it says:
"If you choose to take settlement in bitcoin, BitPay will forward bitcoin payments to your bitcoin address on file. The minimum settlement is 0.01 BTC."
So it sounds like you get exactly what they took.
So if the wholesaler says it's $10, I sell at $11, Bitpay send me a dayly transfer of the exact amount they took by the time the wholesaler opens for business and I give them the $11 worth of BTC it's only worth $9 so I've made a loss instead of a profit.

OK so it's possible to make the transactions if you roll up your sleeves, maybe in the future the protocol will allow wallet software to make them.
So let's say I've managed to forge myself a shiny new transaction that is an ANYONE_CAN_PAY. How do my friends with their web wallets / armory wallets etc send money to it? Is that similarly complicated and requiring heavily technical users?

@_date: 2014-11-24 21:46:31
Oh I absolutely intend to record that, and use a database. What I don't want to do is measure a balance inaccurately. You can't, for example, receive any error from SQL executed from a trigger, which could result in the belief that someone's balance is different to its true value. By always using API calls to coinbase or some other wallet service would ensure accuracy of balances I think.
Do you know of other wallet services with an API and fee-less micro transactions?
@_date: 2014-07-27 11:46:52
They don't use bitpay. They have a wallet address and I think they use an exchange to convert.

@_date: 2014-08-01 09:43:17
I signed up but with fiat payouts having a minimum of £1,000 ($1690) and even Bitcoin payouts being only daily instead of instant I decided there's too much wait in fiat and too much volatility risk in Bitcoin. 
Instead I'm going to use Coinbase to start taking Bitcoin payments. While as a UK trader I'm not permitted instant conversion to fiat, I can get instant access to it, so I can trade into fiat myself on a callback to avoid volatility, then back into BTC to withdraw.
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:36:03

@_date: 2014-01-27 10:44:05
Could you (or anyone) explain how this'll work?
I'm awaiting verification, I'm in Europe and obviously I'm interested in 
a) getting my fiat out of gox into another exchange
b) using this 5% fee advantage to buy BTC elsewhere, sell on gox and and withdraw fiat at a profit (rinse &amp; repeat)
@_date: 2014-07-27 12:05:06
As they don't support the UK for instant payout what I could do is use them as merchant and when the callback confirms payment then I could use their API to sell the bitcoins to USD myself as the 'to bank account daily' would have been amazing, but not entirely necessary.

The money they put in there might not all be put in escrow. They might deposit 1BTC and only put 0.5 in escrow for something. I'd need to be able to reflect the new balance accurately. If I leave it in there I'd have to rely on a database to record the balance, whereas moving it out of that address into escrow would allow the API call to get the true balance.

So we are all living in a world where the majority of bitcoin is being generated by whom? Chinese miners with low electricity costs? Seems odd that bitcoin has that kind of inequality.

Thanks for the reply. That's a little too abstracted as solutions go, and their json rpc approach is too far the other way. Still, it might be the foundation for a solution, perhaps.

Some art is, some is gone. Overall the house is solid and pretty good. Plenty of work needed cosmetically. My problem was the price. He wants £77k equivalent in BTC, but within 1/2 a mile there are houses the same size, with no cosmetic issues inside for £40k. Incredibly nice guy though, I wish him luck.

That's a pretty narrow show. I've seen UX demos before any real development is done (often before requirements and AC are even written) that are comparable. Maybe he's stoking the hype train to try and secure some more funding. This looks shaky considering how long he's been crowing about it.

Instead of

Over 2 weeks ago they claimed on issue 18 it was a "work in progress". Then a couple of days ago they raised a bounty and provided none of this WIP code as a starting point. Scam.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:52:10
It's been proven that Bitcoin Gold is about to fork in 2 days with no solid replay protection. Over 2 weeks ago they said they were working on it:
Then 2 days ago they created a bounty (paying in BTG of course) for someone else to do it ASAP. They released no code for someone to work from (so they'd clearly never been working on it).
On top of all that, they don't plan to have different address formats in their release so it's going to be messy as fuck.
Anyone who was HODLing BTC waiting for BTG is now thinking "ah fuck, this was a scam and I nearly fell for it", and taking their investments elsewhere, spending their BTC or cashing out.

Look on blockchain.info for the address and find out when/where your funds went. Compare with your email, you'll probably find you spent them yourself and forgot. No chance a 'fork' caused the balance change.

Re Fork: 
Bitcoin Gold? Shitshow of ineptitude, no replay protection in place or even started. 3 days to launch. RIP.
B2X? Trezor say they will look at supporting more coins as soon as there is a sane way to work with them. Right now it has no replay protection, no unique addresses, nothing. However, if you put your BTC in a Trezor then when the fork comes you'll still have forked B2X on that address, regardless of Trezor supporting it by launch time or not.

Bitcoin Gold is definitely either a scam or a fucking disgrace. 2+ weeks ago they said they were "working on replay protection". Today they opened a bounty for someone to write some replay protection (paying in BTG of course).
Absolute shitshow of incompetence, possibly willful.

Mark Karpeles ran Mt.Gox with poor code and poor security practices. As someone who works in IT, I can tell you that your CTO is essentially your company's chief engineer. He'll make decisions about code quality and about security compliance while under a range of pressures from the overall business and its non-tech members. Someone with a track record of cutting corners and treating security like a blocker to timelines rather than an essential tool in product quality means the product will be poorly lead. This becomes considerably more relevant when the product is security focused.
Edit: Prime example - he wrote his own SSH server from scratch in PHP and thought it was more secure than OpenSSH.

Hi crazy people. Long time hodler here. I'm no American (maybe that helps?) and I just read the relevant section.
It's about preventing money being brought into the US and out. It's pretty standard for a country to ensure they are not haemorrhaging currency value.
The bill only calls for a report on  a plan, due in 18 months. That's a long time in Bitcoin.
