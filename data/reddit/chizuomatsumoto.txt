@_date: 2019-06-17 16:44:22
Well thats the thing right? You have to have a clear cut set of rules to trade by, that significantly beats the market in backtesting.
There's a time for trading, if you have the disposition and skillset for it, but it's not during a long term uptrend, and it should never be with you're entire bankroll.
EDIT: For example, here's the backtest performance from a simple RSI strategy, that beats the market, with only 2 or 3 trades a week. It generates around enough of a return off of a $2000 bankroll to comfortably live off of in many parts of the world, without needing to touch what I'm hodling.

Inflation is a description of price, not supply. Deflationary means that the price of goods for X decreases over time. Changes in supply can only cause inflation/deflation. Bitcoin is by definition deflationary, because the relative value has increased over time, partially due to a decrease in incoming supply, and partially due to speculation.
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:25:29
I wonder though...
For example, if you had a large memorabilia collection, and the certificates were damaged, could you claim a loss of the value of the memorabilia, even if the item itself wasn't damaged?

Think about this: you buy 100 worth of bitcoin, which turns into $1000, and the crashes back to $150 a few years later. You keep hodling, and a few years later, it’s worth $10000. You know a crash is coming, because you’ve been through several of them, and there’s no guarantee that it won’t tank to 0 next time.
Meanwhile, you’re working in a store not making much money, living paycheck to paycheck.
For the most part, the only people the didn’t sell at some point, where people that could afford to lose it all anyway.
That’s why I always recommend just buying some small amount every payday, just like a 401k. It’s not $xxxxx that you could lose at any moment, it’s just something you spend $20 every week.
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:58:45
Just like the 2017 crash, the price dump was preceded by 2 weeks of increasing prices, and decreasing volume. Combine that with the steadily increasing volatility over the same time period, and it wasn't a fluke or just a panic sell. It was completely normal price action.

Assuming every traded was executed without any issues (order books be damned), it's a 20% profit across 10 trades over the course of a month, 7 of which were profitable. The big price dump in the middle is the recent crash from 9k a few weeks back. The buy and hold return over the same timeframe was around 7%.
The strategy has preformed well for a long time, particularly durring the "bear market", although it requires a little adjustment for downtrends. I use it occasionally. For the most part, it's just buying and selling based on the rate of change, rather than the percentage. So when prices rise drastically in a short period of time, it's likely to come down, and when they crash quickly, they're likely to go back up. All in the short term of course.
As I said though, I don't trade during a long term uptrend. It's too stressful.
And no, taxes are not included.

@_date: 2019-04-16 14:01:43
Laws, regulations, and industry standards. There's a lot involved. I work in e-commerce, and we deal with many of the same regulations. It's complicated, and a lot of it isn't even clearly defined. It varies state to state, country to country, and company to company. You may for example meet every legal standard to operate in some particular place, but not meet the standards of a company you partner with.
Like I said though, they're likely just paying for another service to handle the issue for them, and that service, because they need to market themselves under a variety of regulatory standards, may have more broadly stringent standards than needed.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:14:55

Sure they are. Intrinsic value doesn’t exist. Value is a function of the consensus desire, weighted by scarcity. It’s all entirely subjective. Gold only has value if we both agree it has value, and we can only agree it has value if we both want it.

@_date: 2019-04-02 05:09:29
And at midnight no leas
@_date: 2019-04-14 03:04:40
Well, for one, it still depends completely on subjective desire. That aside though, it doesn’t solve our problem in my view, because it can’t be transmitted across the globe, or even across moderate distances easily, and increasing the supply is just a means of mining more, stealing more from other country’s,  faking it, or any number of other schemes. It’s a good solution up till now, but we need a more advanced solution to modern circumstances.
Beyond all of this though, I would point towards the simple proof of the world as it currently exists. Gold was the standard, and it failed. Governments and banks were powerful enough to horde it, and inevitably to discard it for fractional reserve. No further proof is needed, as they’ve already done it.
The “gold standard” �� of an ideal currency in my view is something that no one can control, outside on the “marketplace” of consensus.
That’s the real value of bitcoin that people miss, and it’s simple brilliance. The energy issue needs to be resolved though. The projections are completely unacceptable.

If you're engaging in illegal activity, or doing commerce with people that are, then yeah, you need to do something. It hasn't been an issue for me, but I don't do either of those things. Bitcoin isn't the problem. Government overreach is. No one is stopping you from sending bitcoin P2P. The issue is, sending it to an exchange that's licensed by the government, so that you can exchange it for fiat currency.
I'd just look into using a different exchange personally, or spend it directly where possible.
edit: buncha edits to clarify my point.
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:17:32
Tumbling, alternate exchanges, XMR...you have a lot of options.
@_date: 2019-04-16 14:09:33
That's the exact opposite of my point. The specific hurdle we're talking about, is the ability of someone to exchange crypto for fiat with a company licensed by the state to transfer money. Send cash from a gambling site to PayPal, and you'll run into the same issue. The hope of crypto is that we one day won't need to exchange it for another currency. In the mean time though, there are other solutions.
Feel free to prove me wrong, and send me your illicit gambling profits here, and we'll see if anyone steps in to shut down the transaction.  qpvtydw6vey4jjnfegn54l5kled947sy3s6uy3lh65

Hazards of an immutable ledger combined with a totalitarian government.
Let’s be realistic though. The only people having this issue, as far as I can tell, are people using bitcoin to circumvent the law.

@_date: 2019-04-01 16:49:24
Same here. I was mining in early 2010, when it was just for fun, and my computer got stolen. Peak value would have been almost half a billion.
I remind myself that even if I hadn’t lost it, I still wouldn’t have held on to it all this time. I was broke as hell in my early 20s and had to live in a friends couch for a few months at one point. I’d have sold as soon as it had any value.
@_date: 2019-04-16 14:24:27
The regulations we're talking about are specific to [money service businesses]( They're not relevant to anything else.
@_date: 2019-04-14 01:01:46
Oh, for sure it has a use, but if you think about it, those are just things that we want. It’s useful in its function. There’s nothing intrinsic about it. Not to get too esoteric, but nothing is self defined. All understand and value judgment comes through contrast and comparison.
The function of bitcoin, and crypto in general (crypto vs crypto politics aside), is as a immutable record of exchange related to how time is allocated. The same function as all other “money”, just imo an improvement on it.
“Money” as a function is far more important imo than most people acknowledge. It’s a function of value, and value is at the very core of all human interaction. It’s the foundation for almost everything. Like a sort of universal converter. A lot of things are difficult to measure against each other, so we assess a value and then convert from the value. Money serves as a record of value, and of the value of what we do. Unfortunately, in the current monetary system, that record is subject to distortion by powerful governments and banks, because the record can be altered by simply creating money. My hope is that bitcoin, or some other crypto, will serve as a solution to that problem.

Just send it to the address.
You can send a small amount first, to make sure you’re doing it right.
Not sure what the mempool is looking like tho, so it might take a while

Add all of them to the same chart in trading view. When bitcoin drops, they all drop. 
I have a little BAT though. It’s a cool project. I expect the price to dump though once Brave allows withdrawals.

The problem I keep running into with that line of thought is, banks are inefficient. They require an enormous amount of resources to operate. 
All we need is better, more streamlined user friendly software. I think phones with hardware wallets and well built “crypto banking apps” are the next step.

I don’t gamble, I invest. I’m an actual analyst, not just someone pretending at alchemy. No one can predict the market short term. You might as well flip a coin.
If you believe I’m wrong, it’s easy enough to demonstrate. Define your strategy, backtest it, and show your proof.

Yeah, there’s nothing comparable to bitcoin in terms of returns right now. I just hate the day tradings TA bullshit that gets passed around. It’s bad advice, and it legit hurts people.

Buy and hodl friend. No amount of trading beats the market. There’s 100 years worth of scientific literature on every strategy imaginable. None of it beats the market. Pick investments, not timing.
Buy a bitcoin and hodl for 10 years. It’ll be worth nothing, or you’ll never work for someone else again.

Yes, I’m an analyst. I have personality backtested every imaginable strategy over the past several years.
There’s no need to take my word for it though. Entire teams of PHds have been studying markets for 100 years now. There’s an enormous amount of scientific literature on it if you’re interested. TA is little more than astrology.
Investing periodically over time levels out losses, without losing the gains that come with hodling. Pick assets, rather than gambling in market cycles.
There’s a reason less than one percent of day traders are successful. If skill were the issue, the profitability ratio would form a Pareto distribution. It doesn’t, because it’s just luck. TA is trash.

@_date: 2019-05-12 05:55:27
You don’t have bitcoin. You have bitcoin cash. BCH instead of BTC. BTC is around $7300 right now.
It’s up today, so I would transfer to coinbase pro, and exchange for bitcoin(BTC). If you bought in at 200, you just made a nice profit.
Search for the wallet address here, to find out what you have. You need to be sure about what it is before transferring it, because you’ll lose it if you send it to the wrong type of address.

If you buy the dip, you can balance out your losses. That’s why you invest periodically with your 401k.
Regular periodic buy ins and long term holding is the most studied highest performing investment strategy by far. Nothing beats it long term.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:34:17
