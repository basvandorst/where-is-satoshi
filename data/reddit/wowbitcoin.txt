What if the person has no bank account?

This is like a Wifi hotspot?  I can connect wirelessly with devices or with ethernet cord?

Are you serious OP?  Did you think at all before posting this? If its not an actively traded pair, then there is no "rate."  If you want to an estimate, just look up the UZS/USD exchange rate and calculate it yourself.  
Next post from OP:  Bitcoin isn't wiping my ass for me!!  This is just so basic, and there is not even a tech support I can call!!!

Yup, totally dead.  See you later!

Such a silly attitude imho and unrealistic for many merchants.  You would really prefer they don't accept bitcoin until they can meet all 3?  Also most customers probably would prefer their balance to be in USD.

Cool, thanks!!

Yes there is poker, but most customers and the lion's share of their revenue is from sports betting.  There are very few "winning regs" there.

So true, Pokerstars is definitely at the tipping point and could easily lose its pole position.  But just to be clear, Bovada is much bigger than just poker.  This is probably the merchant likely to steer more volume to bitcoin than anything else to date (maybe I am forgetting 1 or 2, but I don't think so).

Clearly you are not a sports bettor.  Sports bettors rarely withdraw... :D
