Anyone with “Kathrine” in their username that doesn’t speak English well is probably a scammer
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:22:07
That awkward moment when it ranks and only BTC is left
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:38:15
You heisted the heist
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:30:44
Then they don’t have the chance to buy back in without losing money
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:31:59
You about to be scammed like a mofo. He’s going to chargeback any payments he’s ever given you, and escape with your money. Don’t be an idiot
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:38:01
Backup generators?
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:04:56
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:53:08
Because he makes stupid posts like this one
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:02:48
Lol Indians and their fake Legend of Zelda money... when will they learn

What is your 24 word security code also? Asking for science purposes
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:33:03
Ah... the famous Willy Woo. A most excellent bitcoin profit
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:06:52
Why don’t they just guess the numbers on your credit card while they’re at it
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:50:08
Seems legit/10
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:54:36
Well I happen to be an analyst, with the same credentials as the ones mentioned in here, and I say 100k
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:56:20
Around for 2 years... gets 1/4 of karma from one post... calls other people Karma Farmers.... 
Makes sense
@_date: 2019-08-29 06:07:14
Are you retarded?
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:10:00
@_date: 2019-08-01 00:50:35
Lol “for buying too much bitcoin”
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:25:10
Challenge it to a fistfight for lying to you..
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:25:13
Can’t wait til you sell when it goes down 1k and gets bought up by a hodl’r
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:01:22
It will always fluctuate, always... however it will grow more stable in time and the fluctuations will probably decrease (at least in price) as it is more adapted, distributed, and accepted. 
It’s like gold, my friend. Gold is still prone to some crazy price fluctuations and gold was what our money was backed with all the way until 8/15/71.

“A boy who won't stand up for himself becomes a man who can't stand up to anything.” 
Bro, it’s not about monetary losses, bro, it’s about your livelihood. You wanna be known as a coward?
BRO you ever hear of the band Rage Against the Machine? Dude, they used to fight Adobe Photoshop for fun back in the day. Mining software is nothing to them.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:54:06
You’ll never be enough.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:46:10
Yea, just a month ago it hit 9000 and then bounced to like sub 7000
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:07:59
Bruh. Save your BTC and buy yo self a cup... and the. Buy some more bitty coin
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:12:00
No, just don’t let him sell
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:51:28
Don’t apologize. This is a good thing. You probably weren’t in it for very long and it’ll get bought up in no time, making it that much more scarce of a resource
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:30:21
Yea, you’re right, 250% return is child’s play..........
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:26:56
“And then I went out with daddy and got some ice cream!!!”
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:32:48
It’s  going to go back up, it’s just a dip. They’re pretty normal
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:36:28
Yet you regret buying just because of a minuscule dip?
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:55:02
You never go all-in
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:44:38
Lol that’s about right
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:28:05
Probably around 1,000,000 BTC, but I really haven’t used them since maybe 2011...
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:41:26
Dude... it literally fluctuated worse than this just a month ago... this is literally nothing
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:53:16
Except it hasn’t dropped 50%
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:39:13
Dude! You freakin’ on it! THAT is how we do it. Don’t become a slave to your own technology, make it a slave to you. Put down the revolts, bro, or they’ll never respect you. You got this fam!
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:11:59
My favorite part was when he said “blooby gooble doo, flimsy whimsy dibble snips”
Haha jk, I dont understand Polish
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:52:16
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:10:21
You should fight it
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:09:34
you got in to make 1%? That makes no sense even if you owned 1 BTC, that’s still only $124
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:19:58
Because you understand how prices fluctuate and a short profit is never better than a long one
@_date: 2019-09-04 03:57:09
I have so much money because of that that it isn’t even funny.
