Just make sure you don't live in one of the 3 US states that wont allow you to use GDAX... found that out the hard way today. Sucks.

Haeaii, Wyoming, and Minnesota

Me too. Are they still trying? Whats the second best exchange deal?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:13:15
I wanted to get on GDAX this week and ran into this unexpectedly. Could they not get a license here!? Are they still trying?
What do you use instead?
@_date: 2014-03-29 14:56:50
TIL Sith use Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-08-31 21:06:24
How is that measured? Or what variables drive both metrics?
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:02:19
Forgive my ignorance, but is there a guide for dummies that goes over the basics of Bitcoin variables with price change?
If more coins are owned, does the price go up? 
If more coins are not owned, does the price go down?
I'm trying to grasp the concepts in a manner I can retain.

Thanks for the help!
So the prices you see on the various tickers are driven by speculation? Speculation from whom, the exchange?

I had the same misunderstanding a few weeks ago. My Bitcoin purchase was ultimately cancelled.  It was my first purchase, which I guess takes a week or more to get.

I work for Fox News and I can confirm that we are running with this comment this evening as a valid update on the demise of Bitcoin. We have been waiting for this story for quite some time. Thanks!

I'd imagine it's high volume of buys with the price drop recently.

@_date: 2014-09-15 05:08:08
Thanks for this!
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:39:46
What question, concerning price fluctuation, should I be asking?
Where does the supply and demand come from?
@_date: 2014-08-31 21:09:53
You're obviously not forgiving my ignorance (as I had stated initially), and you're not helping me whatsoever. You're not being a very nice steward of the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:56:47
Thanks I'll take a look at it.

I purchased my first Bitcoin  this weekend with Coinbase. I wasn't impressed, it's going to take six days to see it!
Any services faster than that?
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:55:18
Is it fast to transfer BTC between wallets, but slower to convert into and out of fiat?
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:04:27
What are the predictions if some or all of those coins move, or are dumped on the market?
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:14:55
50 Lindens!? That's a lot of money!

That Israeli example is like a US 401k, but the account may be structured differently.
401k, account is owned and managed by the employee. Both employee and emoloyer can contribute. Employer usually only opts to a certain percentage.
Pension, account is owned and funded by the employer and paid out to qualified employees upon retirement. Can be dissolved in bankruptcy or defunded.

One of these is doing its own thing.
