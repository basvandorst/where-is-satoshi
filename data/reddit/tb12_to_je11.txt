Yeah I'm still learning about investing and I'm a bit of a gambler so I'm pretty torn.
At the end of the day even if I lost all my bitcoin I would be fine, so I'll probably just hold onto it until it reaches an insane number, other than the initial investment that I take out.

I probably will soon

If it goes over 20k I'll probably take out my initial investment and try to ignore it better

I put six figures in at around $4k
I want to sell so badly, I'm so tempted. 
But I just KNOW that I will regret it
God bitcoin sucks, I keep checking it like a crackhead looking for his drug dealer

Bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment

They may be retards, but at least they aren't bitcoin users.

I don't care what it's worth in a year, it won't change anything, even if it 3x's in value.

Because it's not a stable form of currency and probably never will be, and in the grand scheme of things bitcoin itself is too small for them.
Can bitcoin handle trillions of dollars?

Yeah.... it will always be a pennystock.
Until people realize how ridiculous it is, and it's not even worth being a pennystock.

I'm only talking about it as a form of currency and how people act like one day everyone will be using bitcoin instead of other currencies.
