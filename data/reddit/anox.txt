Miners certainly have the power to restrict bad changes to the Bitcoin network in the same way as security guards have the power to prevent some workers at a tech company from producing a robot that is designed to attack and kill the same security guards. You are making it sound as if they don't have such power, and some are even calling to test that bad idea.

The same thing has been done by governments throughout the world for centuries, even millennia, not with bitcoin, but gold, silver and sometimes other commodities. That included democracies such as the US. For some of its history the mint only took a small coinage fee and didn't extract much, or any seigniorage (profit). In effect the whole demand subsidy went to whoever was holding and mining gold or silver in the world.
By the way, going from that to fiat money simply meant that the entity citizens are forced to pay seigniorage to became a single private currency provider (the FED) and that its seigniorage went from near 0% to near 100%.

It makes sense. By the way, this explains the actions of a certain group of scammers here. They would first inexplicably shill and astroturf the so-called "bits" brand idea. Don't ask, it was just a really dumb but mostly harmless charade (to weed out anyone who had even the slightest conception about computer science and basic terminology such as bits and bytes). Then, once they had identified dumb and manipulable marks, they would shove more serious shit down their throats such as big block shitcoins and UASF scamcoins. Thankfully the scammers themselves turned out to be too incompetent to pull off any major or dangerous scam (for now).

I wouldn't blindly trust any software coming from this guy who promoted the shameful BIP149 UASF scheme. I'd expect the developers of wallets I use to be able to see when a piece of code tries to create a new shitcoin (even worse than the one shilled by the Roger gang) and [potentially donates all the user's bitcoins to the miners]( and then I'd expect them to reject it, not shill for it. I don't know if he was just extremely naive or malicious. Either way, I wouldn't blindly trust his software. I wouldn't waste my time reviewing it either. Just see what happened when people very politely pointed out the major problems in the UASF idea. The UASF proponents didn't even listen to criticism, they went the opposite way and made it even worse. Be careful where you put your money, people!
@_date: 2018-11-02 01:56:45


You're just demonstrating fallacious logic, once again. SegWit (as BIP141, and BIP9) existed before BIP148, and BIP141 got activated (as did other BIP9 soft forks and similar before it). There is absolutely no reason to think that there wouldn't be SegWit on the network today. You seem to want to squeeze BIP148 into your false narrative as having something to do with BIP141 activation by the miners on the Bitcoin network, but you have been completely unable to. You are a disgrace. I am more and more convinced that you cannot be trusted.
@_date: 2018-11-01 23:51:36
If you really think that these articles had a valid point, then you still don't get it. UASF is not really a game of chicken when one side (the miners) had no risk. They really didn't care (and neither did the exchanges, by the way). As we saw, they didn't mind even creating a chainsplit and a new shitcoin. Although that one had replay protection, which yours did not, and having no built-in replay protection made it a total joke for exchanges and potentially a very bad scam against users! But that potential scam was no negative risk for the miners. It was only a potential opportunity for the miners to profit from the stupidity of any UASF users who thought that SegWit could be used without miners backing them. So UASF users had everything to lose and miners had absolutely nothing to lose and *maybe* even something to gain. So it was the last thing on their minds.
All this was well explained at the time. You sticking to your fallacious arguments speaks very badly of you.
Edit: This is speaking of UASF specifically. Delaying SegWit itself (BIP141) had its opportunity costs, but that had nothing to do with the UASFs which came later.

What you call "hate this/boycott that" and "\*ism and fanaticism mentality of "us against them"" is also called concern trolling. There's been plenty of that and plenty of astroturfing and other dishonest means to perpetrate it. You need to keep in mind that subreddits are centralized entities with authorities, so it is not really up to you to have the final word on what belongs in a subreddit and what doesn't, when those authorities have decided to exercise their power extensively. Especially when the authorities themselves participate (remember UASF, for example, the most absurd Bitcoin boycott so far).
Many people have been pretty shameless about doing this kind of things. Even some formerly respectable individuals have been guilty of it (e.g. [Gregory]( [Maxwell]( [Adam Back]( and others).

No2X was the status quo, in opposition to 2X (the fork, potential shitcoin). So if you insist that we make a comparison to this unrelated thing, No2X was like BIP141 (already widely deployed, hence status quo) and 2X was like BIP148 (the fork, potential shitcoin). Of course the status quo wins by default. This contradicts your point about BIP148.


BIP148 futures were barely traded on one obscure exchange and they were worthless (see, link doesn't even work anymore:  According to the free market, BIP148 was hardly even a thing, to the extent that it cared at all. The vast majority of nodes were BIP141 nodes. Again, evidence that BIP148 did nothing.

I'm reading the good points in your comment and I'm amused at the negative points with a dagger († for controversial). Curiously, the UASF astroturfing and damage control is still continuing. Clearly someone does not want the truth about UASF to be known.


We can't, we shouldn't and we don't need to. Unless, of course, by "upgrade" you mean forking off into an altcoin that has only a fraction of the original hashpower, thus being exposed to all attacks you could and couldn't think of, including 51% attacks by miners who the UASF agitators tried their best to piss off. 
It's quite simple, really. If a change is really good for Bitcoin then miners would support it eventually, once they understand this. So, if you think that a change is good you either need to convince them, or invest in mining yourself and signal for it yourself and reap the reward from the subsequent appreciation. Beware of politician types who promise you things which can't happen as advertised, but which would actually be disastrous if pursued, and then when someone else makes different things happen they say "see, I made this happen"! They couldn't be more dishonest.
Indeed SegWit is not "anyone-can-spend" **unless** something like a UASF minority chain split happened in which case it absolutely is, on the significant chain. And if UASF pushers tell you that they didn't want a minority chain split scenario, then why push UASF over SegWit (BIP141) when the only thing that UASF adds is the possibility of this exact scenario (along with a few other failure modes).
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:25:15


They saw that their software was adopted by almost no users apart from the miners and companies which signed the agreement. A change in consensus rules (soft fork or hard fork) cannot happen successfully without being adopted and approved by most of the miners *and* most of the rest of the nodes, and this has long been known. BIP141 (SegWit) had first been adopted by a large majority of all nodes and then approved by over 80% of the miners, so it did go through. The S2X hard fork part was only adopted by most of the miners, but not the rest, so it did not go through. BIP148 (UASF) was unsurprisingly not adopted by any significant fraction of the users, nor miners, so it did not go through (and it could have failed anyway due to its unusually bad design).
The lack of adoption of S2X software on nodes is an entirely sufficient explanation, whereas your explanation involving UASF (which is something which played out months earlier) makes no sense whatsoever.

Projecting much? You don't even know what that word (phishing) actually means. But you probably heard other people use that same word to correctly describe a fake version of the download page for BitcoinCore that several [Core developers and some astroturfers used in order to dishonestly spread another, even worse forking client, namely BIP148 (UASF)](
You could argue that the site you mentioned is fraudulent, but it is not phishing fraud. Phishing fraud is a different kind of fraud. It doesn't pretend to be the .org website or BitcoinCore's website. This is what the UASF website does, and so it can correctly be called a phishing website.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:56:35


And that is why miners *wanted* to activate SegWit (BIP141), as opposed to UASF (BIP148) achieving anything "without miner's cooperation". So this is miners *cooperating* out of their self interest for collecting more fees thanks to SegWit use under a safe activation. Contrast that to the UASF false worldview that miners allegedly can and even should be coerced by what is in truth an empty threat.
In short, for the purpose of changing the consensus rules, cooperation and incentives work; empty threats and gimmicks such as UASF don't work at all, and may even work the opposite way (incentivizing a delay in activation).
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:36:09


What a conflicted, unsubstantiated and absurdly wrong claim. You just agreed with his statements, including that UASF is very controversial. Then you said this.
Don't you realize that if the miners really didn't want to cooperate into activating SegWit (BIP141) they had plenty of options to maintain status quo? They could prevent UASF from forking off. Moreover, they could even profit from a UASF, if people really believed in it, and still get back to status quo. They could let UASF fork off into an altcoin and then, as a matter of fact, that's an exceptional scenario in which SegWit would indeed be "anyone-can-spend" on the chain where everyone except UASF nodes would be. Miners would be able to get all these bitcoins for free, as a kind of bonus for **not** activating SegWit too early!

This was just a statement of intention, which turned out to be false (talk is cheap). They later dropped their promise to mine with a BIP148 node and signed the New York agreement for S2X. We don't know how much, if any hashpower would have been working on a BIP148 fork of the blockchain had there not been BIP91 activation. We just didn't get to see this scenario play out in practice.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:19:14


He said "nothing prevents", not "nothing incentivizes the contrary". Don't you see the difference? Besides, there can be incentives for both choices and they could weigh them. In fact, if they don't allow a chain split they don't have to make this choice. Nothing prevents them from blocking a UASF. However, they can't prevent you from going the way of the thing in your username, if you ever wanted that (please don't).
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:17:02
That copypasta is about BIP8. BIP148 (the UASF in question which was released and attempted) was not following the BIP8 mechanism. Only BIP149 (not even implemented in code) was following the BIP8 mechanism. Are you talking about completely backing off from BIP148, which was supposedly already deployed by so many, and then deploying BIP149? That would lead you right to the last, and most dramatic, part of my paragraph, where you get:


And in this case it would be sudden. UASF nodes forking off and grinding to a halt would happen only at this moment, removing this form of forewarning for the users that things are awfully wrong with this software. Sounds like a more effective way to fool users into donating their BTC to the miners, if that is what you want.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:27:36


Not necessarily. They could even be profitable. The things I mentioned, one by one, are:


That would cost next to nothing, just the cost of writing a few lines of code.


Again, next to no cost beyond the cost of typing the magic word "invalidateblock" or a few lines of code to make sure that no miner orphans any valid non-SegWit-signalling block in an attack analogous to selfish mining, under the guise of UASF. It is literally that easy and cheap to stop the touted orphaning threatened by UASF. Then the miners would actually have increased mining revenue from the decreased difficulty from any UASF miners forking off and wasting their hashpower. It's ironic that the attackers would reap what they sow, namely realize that their blocks are the ones which in essence get orphaned, because their blockchain would be unviable. If a BIP148 blockchain ever survived long enough to activate SegWit, and users tried to use SegWit there, then this "anyone-can-spend" behavior would be at play, giving the miners more revenue still, on top of the revenue from reduced difficulty. No significant costs per se (expenses) for any of this.
In my other comment I mentioned:


These do cost resources. They could be very profitable, as we now see in various altcoins which had the imprudence of discouraging and diminishing mining efficiency and mining in general, and are now being attacked profitably with relatively low amounts of hashpower. As I explained above, miners don't need to actually attack a UASF blockchain in order to protect the status quo or even potentially profit. However, a blockchain with just 0.4% of the hashpower (that's how much was signalling support for BIP148 last I remember) would be quite easy and affordable for many to attack in order to double spend, short sell or whatever.
Trying to keep a BIP148 blockchain in existence long enough to even get to its first difficulty readjustment is what would have been very costly.


I guess there could be truth in that... as long as you view UASF as a ploy to make more money for miners, at the expense of people who don't understand what UASF actually does.
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:38:17


After the flag date BIP148 still needed to finish the current 2016-block long signalling period, then go through a whole new 2016-block long signalling period to achieve the signalling threshold, then go through another 2016-block long lock-in period just to get to SegWit activation, and this before the expiry of SegWit signalling about a half year after flag date, because seemingly nobody thought about this part. With the negligible hashpower you had you wouldn't be able to get it to activation (it needed at least about 15% hashpower just to get to activation within that half year time). With the actual hashpower you had you wouldn't even be able to touch your first mining reward (100 blocks) before SegWit expired. That's how slow your blockchain would be built. Difficulty reductions would come after even more time and note that they are limited to 1/4 at most. And then, even if you had &gt;15% (you didn't, it's mathematically impossible) and got to activate SegWit, without replay protection your SegWit transactions could be replayed by miners on the Non-BIP148 chain, with your money redirected to the miner's wallet (due to the "anyone-can-spend" behavior to make SegWit possible via a soft fork).


You wanted to avoid creating an altcoin through a contentious hard fork, so you invented a way to... create an altcoin through a contentious *soft* fork. You know what? I'm of the opinion that the "create an altcoin" part is the root of the problem. The path you choose to achieve it is merely secondary. I'm merely saying "if you want to do this damn silly thing don't do it in this damn silly way". And it's a damn silly way, because it transforms what would be an altcoin into something even worse, an altcoin that can't achieve anything (false promises of SegWit), can't survive (no altcoin), but it *can* make you lose your BTC (leaving you with nothing)! It's worse than an altcoin, it looks more like a scam, in its ultimate potential.


You are projecting. I already demonstrated that I know much more about how things actually work than you.
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:01:09


It was easy enough to prove how much hashpower you all had, and the fact that you couldn't prove more than 0.4% in the end (last I remember) says enough.


It is not really a gambit when your sacrifice leads to you getting [royally forked](
It's more like a triple disadvantage. Waste power on inefficient and insufficient mining to very slowly create blocks that build your separate puny fork that can't activate SegWit, or even if it did, you can't use it because you just had to make your forkcoin a soft fork (for what reason?) with no replay protection, meaning trying to use SegWit would lead to your BTC being captured by the miners who you professed to be your opponent. Your actions speak louder than your words. They look as if deep in your soul you wanted to make a donation to those miners.

Only your non-mining node does not function without at least some miners. Do you realize that? You certainly rely on miners. It's like you have your magic watch, but the time it measures magically stops for you if you do something stupid with your watch. It's like other people (the miners) have control over the time dimension for people, depending on which watch settings they use.

This can effectively be used as a **replay attack protection mechanism**. It is itself proposed as a BIP8 soft fork. After activation a miner could start mining these non-standard transactions without enforcing the rule, which will both fork the blockchain and allow users to make transactions which are valid only on the non-enforcing branch. Mining pools on the non-enforcing branch would want to start accepting and mining these non-standard "split" transactions in order to get some of the fees.

Safe *for those 6%*! This is important. Those 6% could lose by far the most, some could even lose all their bitcoins, under certain circumstances. A united large majority (94% or something like that) staying with the current rules could lose little.
Look at [Metcalfe's law]( It's not some law of nature that can be universally applied and exactly calculated with, but it's still useful. Use common sense, too. If only a small percentage (of users, miners, or whatever) splits off, what the rest (a large majority) lose is only those few users/miners. They constitute a small part of the whole value of the network. For example, if 6% split off from the 94%, the Metcalfe's law suggests these values for the two networks:
* Original network: 100%^2 = 100% of the value
* 94% chain: 94%^2 = 88.36% of the value of the original network
* 6% chain: 6%^2 = 0.36% of the value of the original network
* Combined value of both chains (you'd own coins in both): 88.36% + 0.36% = 88.72% of the value of the original network
As you can see, the large majority loses a little, but the small minority loses a lot. The worst case for a split in two is if the network splits exactly in half and stays that way. Then the combined value is 50%^2 + 50%^2 = 25% + 25% = 50%.
This application of Metcalfe's law assumes that when the network splits users choose one network and decide to use only that one network (some supporters of BIP148 and BIP149 say they would do that). For users who decide to use both networks the lost value is somewhat less than that, because they can still pay and accept payments from all users.

Respectfully, do you know what you are talking about here? Do you think that traders creating or supporting something like BIP148 has any connection to safety? No good trader would ever divulge his real intentions for the short, medium and long term - such a trader wouldn't be able to make any money trading. They know enough to run both clients. In particular, altcoin traders can hope for nothing better than there being many small volatile fork coins which carry the brands built by the highly regarded Core developers ("Bitcoin", "SegWit"). Traders can play every scenario that a dangerous proposal creates:
1. if it divides Bitcoin about evenly it would hurt the price the most - **shorting opportunity**;
2. if it creates a small fork coin - it's great for a **pump and dump scheme** (very lucrative). They'd use the brands for the pump, but they don't care if the coin dies after the dump;
3. if it somehow succeeds without a split, which could be simply due to miners supporting SegWit coincidentally getting a mining majority around the activation date, then creators and supporters of the proposal would claim the credit for making SegWit a reality, and then repeat the process with their new undeserved reputation for writing and activating successful proposals. **Long con**.
Some traders can win in in each scenario. Some people go all in on scenario 3. Sure, it can work out once or twice. But some smart "trader" will keep creating such dangerous situations until a disastrous scenario plays out and leads to massive losses for unsuspecting users and miners.


That's a good, and in my opinion, the most important heuristic. I add one more: don't accept approaches which are a strict and deliberate downgrade to the safest ones which have already worked in the past.

If we only get a small chain split where we lose only those few stubbornly reckless users who want to split, it's no big loss for us. I'd say it is no loss at all. We shouldn't be concerned about losing those people. There's inevitably going to be a small group of people who just want there to be a split, no matter what. Let them learn, the easy way or the hard way. It's an important lesson that needs to be learned. They'd probably be back with us after a failed fork, and hopefully wiser, and then we could continue together trying to get support for a safe activation.


There needs to be an actual good and safe (like the default 95% hashpower activation) mechanism proposed and implemented by someone, for SegWit to activate outside the default mechanism. Considering the prior versions and statements by the author of BIP149, frankly, I have zero hope for anything good to come out of there in that direction. Just sticking to some bad and unsafe mechanisms and hoping they turn out all right is not a good strategy.

It seems wintercooled was in a roundabout way actually trying to get you to divulge your intentions after BIP148 coin starts trading, and how much coins you have. Don't let people (especially trader types) learn these things and front run you on the market. That would be like a gift to them. They spend great efforts trying to collect such valuable information. If people keep them in the dark, their games are harder to play.

Perhaps it's some traders who are out of, or even short BTC, probably while speculating on and manipulating other coins. They could only gain from chain splits, or people leaving Bitcoin for other (hopefully for them - their chosen) coins.

You seem to confirm what I recently [commented](










What I didn't mention there is that there is one more scenario: 4. Users and especially miners ignoring it and thus creating no chain split - all effort spent in promotion is wasted. It looks more and more like this is the scenario that is going to play out, certainly with zero miners.
And no, I don't claim that you are part of an organized conspiracy. You may or may not be. It is only natural for there to be people doing what you do.

BIP148 people didn't provide even basic things to make it viable as an altcoin. They could have provided at least replay protection for their chain, but did not. Without a built in replay protection users are left having to find a way to split their BitcoinUASF coins from their Bitcoins. It may be more hassle to split the BitcoinUASF coins than they'll be worth. If you do nothing and send your Bitcoins to somebody while the BitcoinUASF is alive they will likely also receive the same amount in BitcoinUASF coins, because the transaction from the Bitcoin chain will be replayed on the BitcoinUASF chain. Same if you send BitcoinUASF coins - Bitcoins will also be sent.
Perhaps there will be good guides instructing users what to do to safely split their BitcoinUASF coins from their Bitcoins. Perhaps someone will write it only if it became clear that there will be a BitcoinUASF coin.
It looks like on Trezor they allow you to see and use any of these coins at any time. I don't see anything about splitting them, though.

Yes, like every upgrade. The obvious assumption is that we are talking about a *consensual upgrade*, rather than an attempt for an insecure launch of an altcoin or scamcoin.

It looks suspicious to me that you'd even bring up that acronym at all, which has become a kind of a brand name for certain disinformation campaigns and attempted fraud. It's a relatively new brand which only started being promoted *after* Wuille's last major contribution (BIP141 SegWit) was already implemented and being deployed. BIP141 was a normal soft fork based on BIP9 with a certain feature which in effect prevents it from causing a network split. In contrast, the "philosophy" you mentioned by name specifically and solely removes that chain split protection for the users adopting it (without replacing it with anything else) thus deliberately enabling them to split from the network, conditional merely on certain passivity by most miners. So, when it comes to network splits, it is pretty much an opposite "philosophy" to normal soft forks (such as BIP141 and other BIP9 soft forks), even though it is often misrepresented as a similar thing. You know, it is common for fraudulent schemes to be misrepresented as being similar to something legitimate and good, and they often even get more publicity than the legitimate thing when certain people expect to profit from them, but it is really bad if someone makes the mistake of believing such a misrepresentation, even worse repeating it to others. I believe journalists should know this very well.

Yeah, but Bitcoin users are much more vigilant, and have some very principled people, which would not allow an attack such as this to succeed. For example, an attack similar to this one was already attempted in 2017 on Bitcoin (see "UASF", "BIP149", "BIP148") which openly threatened to make a blockchain reorg or an altcoin, but would in fact have only allowed any miner to spend SegWit coins. Despite heavy astroturfing promoting the scams the truth about them got out and they were never able to fool anyone to lose their coins, nor even to launch their shitcoin (that's the reason why the shitcoin discussed in this thread launched instead, scammers had to go looking for dumber fools!)

Yeah, reorgs are not a problem for most participants, e.g. hodlers, but they are a problem for others, such as miners who lose revenue that they deserve from their blocks. So, it is important to note the things that can be done to address such a problem and keep things fair. Every miner needs to know that if one group of miners is thinking of trying a reorg, the other miners could respond in kind, if necessary. Suppose one group (let's call them the aggressors) intentionally starts mining competing blocks (which may or may not be an attempt to impose some soft fork rule). The rest of the miners (let's call them the defenders) would be justified in invalidating all such blocks that they can determine to be part of an intentional attempt to do a reorg. The defenders could implement a soft fork rule of their own to do the job. If the aggressors don't give up, the blockchain could stay split in two for some time and there could be markets for coins on both chains. The market participants should choose the side that they consider to be better. Usually they choose conservatism and honest competition over uncertainty, aggressive and schismatic behavior in the long run (unless we are talking about a shitcoin which since its creation has been all about forking a lot, bullshitting, lying, cheating, thus attracting only the kinds of people who like to participate in such things). So, this prospect is what makes such reorg attacks unprofitable on the cryptocurrency where the highest moral values prevail.

You are thinking of soft forks as providing access to new things, when in fact they can and often do *limit access*. Such is the example gave - big extension blocks limit the users and miners who are able to access full node validation, due to increased resource requirements. Transaction censorship is another example of a soft fork which limits access. And you want this kind of changes to be possible with only a tiny minority in support? That's evil, but thankfully it is also ignorant, so it won't ever work that way!
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:06:25


































So, if this guy understands what he's saying here this means that he now also understands UASF. BIP149 UASF was similar in that with it too the miners would be able to spend all SegWit transactions (in the case of BIP149 there would need to be fools making SegWit transactions, thinking that a BIP149 fork made them safe), and this would be totally allowed by unchanged consensus rules and it would remain on the only active blockchain. Same with BIP148, although it would have been much harder for BIP148 to even survive long enough for that scam to happen. Too bad for the forkers that Bitcoin is not such a shitcoin where such scams can be pulled off.

After all, he bought into BU once, so he could do the same mistake again. But what if he actually learns from his mistake? Then you'll be out of luck.

Have you all noticed the sharp disappearance of most of the conspicuous BIP148 shills and their followers? Like these users who have been mostly absent or silent on the topic for about the last week or more:

I think that the amount of FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), propaganda and disinformation here speaks for itself. They are not really at odds, but certain people want them to appear to be at odds. Classic divide and conquer. It allows certain people to herd naive people into scams, such as altcoin pump and dump schemes, cloud mining scams, blockchain fork scams, scam wallets and exchanges, etc. It is also a way to fool people into trading on the markets in certain ways which lead them to lose money to the manipulators.

You are the one presenting a picture of binary choice between a BU split and a BIP148 split, BinaryResult. Both choices are the choice to split the blockchain and everything else with it. I choose none of the above, because there are other choices. For every scenario in which BIP148 doesn't split, there is an appropriate alternative choice. Choosing BIP148 in the end means a desire to split.
So why did you bring up the BU shills at all?
I'd like my comment visible again, please.

Those who know it would be bad, but want to profit from it anyway, are in an odd situation. Some don't want to come out pumping it with their real name because they care about their reputation. But they still want some drama and surprises to happen, and may try to help BIP148 just enough to cause it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:03:20
The two places are divided and infested by two different cartels in the business of altcoin pump and dump schemes, and scams involving blockchain splits, cloud mining, wallets and exchanges and other dishonest activities. Many people are involved, including people with a lot of influence. It's pathetic, really.
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:43:14
This is what pumpers do when they see that the campaign is not going well.
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:23:22
I've noticed such comments. I support what you are saying.
Without such false dilemmas, boogeymen and suckers to believe them their schemes fall apart.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:38:12


That point wasn't apparent from your original comment. I understand your position now. May I suggest that you should have said something like: "I don't know of any private *corporation* behind BIP148"?


[This must be the post]( you've seen. It doesn't differ from my opinion here - it talks about:




Nowhere did I imply a corporation. When I said:


again, I don't restrict the possibilities to a corporation. Organization could be as simple as a bunch of individuals coordinating reddit/twitter brigades in Teamspeak or Slack, for example.


I did present one piece of evidence in that very same post:


When I say "trader" I don't even imply a corporate organization at all, indeed they are rarely incorporated.
As for altcoin creators, they don't need to be, and are often not, incorporated. I'm not aware of Charlie Lee or BTCDrak creating their coins within corporate structures.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:16:05
You can't associate me with some people who seemingly oppose BIP148, but push for another split of the blockchain. I've noticed such people too, but they either oppose BIP148 for the wrong reasons, or are being hypocritical. You can see in my post history that I oppose both splits of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:09:42
The point of the topic is to have a way to do this without much risk of being scammed on settlement. Can a trustless smart contract be constructed? What highly trusted neutral third party would want to provide a service for this? I'd put precisely zero trust in alpaca and MrHodl.
The first potential sellers you'd want to ask are Jihan Wu and other people from Bitmain/Antpool. After all, they may have the power to heavily influence the outcome by deciding to support the fork. Otherwise, why wouldn't they sell? But there needs to be someone or something really legitimate and trustworthy to enforce the contract first.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:46:02
You mean... helping people buy worthless altcoins and then getting burned on them will help stop them from buying them *again* afterwards? I guess so.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:19:48
I think this is what is called just another shitfork. This one seems targeted at BU supporters. Nothing new under the sun. Of course it is not what it is presented as.
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:33:27
In another comment you said:


That would imply that if the opponents of a proposal don't have some supermajority the proposal should get through. Is that what you want? Yet, in that case the supporters could be minority, e.g. if the supermajority threshold is 95%, 6% could activate a proposal.
In reality a simple majority is enough to reject a proposal and guarantee status quo.
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:00:38
That's the joke. The reasons to fork off become more and more ridiculous. The fork attempts become more and more pathetic. But I don't want fork that splits the coin.

Users can reject a soft fork that they know about. They obviously have to know about a capacity increasing soft fork, otherwise they can't use that capacity. The economy is using the current consensus rules. If a mining majority tried to force a soft fork onto a mining minority and the economy, the latter two could force a split of the blockchain in order to keep following the current consensus rules for themselves. A group of miners alone wouldn't be able to get anywhere by trying to fight the rest of the ecosystem, so a change of the PoW wouldn't be needed. The status quo is powerful. Changing it successfully requires support from a clear majority of both miners and users, the larger the better. Any miner or user trying to go against this reality is hurting all of Bitcoin, but most of all themselves.

I've described the scheme [here]( and it looks like you are thinking of the same potential explanation. The specific coin you've identified also seems to be the one the people in the fork campaign seem the most connected to. Some of the same people who encouraged the fork are now telling us how much we should be fearing it. Then they'll be pushing their "solutions". Boogeyman tactics. Nothing new.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:22:16
Says the BIP148 UASF pumper. You are the one who helped create the mess and now you expect people to buy *your* "solution"!?
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:00:48
But it is a somewhat often repeated scheme - see BU, Bitcoin Class-sick, Bitcoin XT, and even earlier the "50BTC forever" hard fork. I think there's a few more. Wouldn't these past experiences, if combined with a fairly deep and one-sided market, e.g. 10 to 1 in favour of one side or the other, allow for a good enough prediction?
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:22:42
This attack is pretty relevant, because a very similar one was attempted on Bitcoin (but their plan was exposed and they had to give it up). Look up "UASF" and "BIP149" (BIP148 was similar, and the same attack could happen under BIP148 too, but much harder and less likely, and it seemed more like the launch of an altcoin, which also failed). Similar to this attack, it would have allowed SegWit coins to be "stolen" (actually just given away for miners to collect them) by not actually and properly activating SegWit.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:36:08


I'm glad you say this, rbtkhn, because now we know that you know that this is exactly what is expected of you, too. You promote the shameful BIP148 UASF scheme, which is no better than Jihan Wu's shameful schemes. From a moral, legal and even technical perspective they are quite similar in the relevant aspects.
It is interesting that you also say "I'll never use those services." in the tweet. As an insider into one such scheme we should perhaps take this as a confession - that the businesses associating themselves with these schemes should be avoided. This is useful insight that I shall put in practice.
We are eagerly waiting to see who will make a full confession and repent first. Will it be someone from the Jihan Wu/Roger Ver gang or someone from Luke-jr/BTCDrak's? But most of all, I'm interested to read the confession.
