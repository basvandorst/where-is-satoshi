Only chart interval worth looking at is the monthly chart (weekly if you want to torture yourself).  Trend value is 6k.

So I'm just wondering what people think fair value is for 1 BTC? Is there a sense of what price value is about right? Is it this wholly a momentum play?

If you are talking store of value, maybe one way to arrive at some idea of fair value floor of gold, would be  to take the average real price of gold over some time period, over last 50 years that is very (very) roughly a 1000 bucks an ounce. 
But it is hard to arrive at any sense of fair value of bitcoin as a store value. Either 1k, 10k or 100k, is all equally possible. 
10% of the world population is a very random guess. Do 1% of the population own gold?
All I'm saying is, if there is literally no connection between the asset and it's trading value, then is 5k any more a worse guess than 50k for fair value once the dust settles?

So what is the present fundamental value would you say?

You can believe in cats and dogs, but you'd still be skint if you went all in on pets.com in 1999

This is possibility , but I think your misusing the term 'fundamental value', as it is commonly used in investing.  
Any why 1%. This is a very random arbitrary number. Is there any reason you choose 1% above, say,  0.1%? Other than it is a round number?

Okay, but plentry of car companies failed, plenty of dotcom websites fail, radio stations make no money. None of this means that bitcoin will succeed?
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:18:56
sure, but  bitcoin is a brand not a technology? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:31:14
So what is the fundamental value in your opinion, at  present?

I am just wondering at what price will long term holders become concerned this is different. 500? 5000? Is it okay if the price goes below the long term trend (2000ish?) and rebounds, is that healthy or not?

It is quite extraordinary how closely bubbles track the famous "rise &gt; bull trap &gt; return to mean" graph shape everyone knows. But still speculators are surprised every single time one pops, despite all the signs. I just wonder if one day we will collectively realise, or are humans doomed to repeat history for ever more
