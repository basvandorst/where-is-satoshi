I've seen you mention London.  If you are UK based I'm happy to help with this.   I'm not far from London myself.   
Made something along the same lines, a screen embedded in a t-shirt with a full graphics equaliser for a festival.  
It had an app to control it etc...

I'm not really a big user of Skype, can't even remember my login.  You on WhatsApp?  
If so drop me a PM with your details.  Else I'll find my Skype details. 
I'm away from home for a few days but can send your some videos of what I've made before.

If you think there's anyway you could make it work I'm happy to put something together for you.  
I can even just reprogram what I have here.   
It's self contained and is just powered from a usb battery bank.   
That ones only small ( 20x10cm) but could easily go in a side window.

I had  the realisation yesterday that I had actually earned more in bitcoin price rises this month than my salary.  What a crazy thing to be happening.

Brutal buying power.   I'm texting a friend updates and as soon as I've sent they are irrelevant
