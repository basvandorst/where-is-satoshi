Yeah. I don't think what I was doing was worth it. It's just survey's and stuff, tedious things. So, you are virtually just investing in them..I don't have the skillset for the jobs they were looking for at the reddit page. I'm still really interested in them though. What's your view on mining?

How would you mine together? Have you ever mined? Mining for the long term seems like a good idea and fairly safe one..

I am. I want to talk to a miner!! here I come

Please confirm or deny this. When you 'mine' successfully you get a block, which is 25 bitcoins. a bit coin is valued around $600+ atm. So you essentially get $15000?? Am I crazy? I read that it's hard to mine successfully solo but still

I figured that out. That's awesome! You're a legend!!! So, now I have 13 cents worth of bitcoins on my computer. That's sick. Do you have to buy a bitcoin whole? I'm learning.

can you link me to some cheap ones? Would you recommend it?

Thank you for answering that 1 million bits = 1 bitcoin. I needed that!!! So, first off thanks for the tip!!! Second off, you're a legend. Third, is working for the bitcoins worth it? I'm doing it atm and it's tedious but I have nothing to do and I think it's a good way to figure this stuff all out.

wow...Mining is expensive..Is it hard? Like what manual labor goes into it and what type of prerequisite knowledge do you need?? 
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:17:32
What did you just give me?? I love this ish

Yeah...Mining really interests me. I'm good with computers and technology, but not good enough to really understanding mining.
