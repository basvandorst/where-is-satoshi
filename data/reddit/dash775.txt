Coinomi works well for me. Also, not sure what all you've expanded in but if you're still at the top 5 or so then just get a ledger hardware wallet.

You think banks actually keep as much cash on hand as the total value of all their user's accounts? Haaaaaaaaaaaaa. They're numbers on a computer with a bank too, bud

I actually treat ETH the same way. I bought in at $11/coin with a lot of capital and I look back on that decision as being dumb AF. I did ZERO research.
Regardless, it worked out. That being said, my ETH balance is what I have been using to fund all of my alt coin ventures. For this purpose, I LOVE ether. For long term moon or skyrocket pricing, ETH is not the horse I would bet on.
ETH has a great platform and likely isn't going anywhere soon. But I don't expect massive gains from it where I do from other coins. (Because I already got my massive gains from it)

There is absolutely no way that this would fly, hypothetically, of course.

Good Lord. My first comment was sarcastic. Making something a law doesn't stop it from happening, it's a deterrent.
The little blinking sign in the middle of the crosswalk won't stop a car. A friend of mine genuinely believed that it was impossible to get hit by a car because the sign is there and literally wouldn't look both ways before crossing. Like yeah, the sign tells cars to stop, but the driver COULD floor it instead.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:40:05
Wait, are you saying that reporting as like-kind in 2017 may be possible, assuming that anything 2018 or beyond is reported without claiming like-kind??
I understand that you wouldn't place a guarantee on this, but it sounds like you're sayin there's a chance.

Man, this seems like a ballsy move.... claiming something that you expect a fight for.
But then again we're all invested in crypto here so it seems feasible to me lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:02:09
Similarly, it is actually physically impossible to pass a stop sign without stopping.

Wondering if the rest of these comments actually read the article. There's so much foreplay and rephrasing of teaser paragraphs, it's exhausting.
Get to the point

This is not meant to be specific, it's just an example to have an understanding on this:
Hypothetically, if someone initially invested in BTC/any before 2016, and since current legal documentation allows for like-kind to be claimed, pre-2018, could one claim that the initial investment was simply investing in Emerging Technology, Software, etc? Then any sales in 2017 could all be treated as long-term but lumped into the same initial transaction?
I ask because it seems like something any decent lawyer would be able to defend. Not that I'm trying to skirt the law, by any means, just trying to avoid VASTLY overpaying in taxes for an action that, at the time of initial purchase, was not even on the court's radar so, subsequently, no official guidance was available, at all.
Just for detail's sake, I am under the belief that like-kind can and should be claimed for any crypto-crypto trades because ghese coins are all the same technology, they're all "software" they all, fundamentally, serve the same purpose but with different applications.
Over-the-top example: I can trade a brown donkey for a black donkey. They both eat, shit, and chase off wolves. The brown donkeys are worth more in 2017, though, since they also wake you up in the morning. By 2018, no one wants brown donkeys to wake them up anymore so the black donkeys gain more value. I understand not donkeys, but this would be considered like-kind correct? How is this any different than blockchain to blockchain trade?

They already answered this. You pay income tax at the time that you assume ownership ($30k). Then, if you sell immediately, you pay normal capital gains tax and subtract the initial income tax payment. So, be prepared to pay $40k and you'll be pleasantly surprised when it's lower.

That's different. What you described is "more like" using someone else's bank account to hide the fact that you're actually the one taking profits, hypothetically.

My BCH was credited through Coinbase so it was, naturally, the highest price possible when I took possession.

I've been slowly selling bits here and there since the last dip to take some profit and hedge against an, unlikely, potential collapse. By no means am I planning to put my profits back in right now.
That being said, you better believe I'm moving my mountain of BTC to deep dick me some platform tokens.

Another question, and I think it means that bitcoin cash may have saved me.
Let's say a person took possession of their Bitcoin Cash from Coinbase when it was at its all time high with total value of, let's say, $40k. If they sold ALL OF IT later that month for $30k total, this would offset, plus some, and not be nearly as massive of a taxable event as this person expected? Since it was at a loss?
