Ethereum is still $140

So what incentive does Jihan Wu have to solve the scaling problem now that he's hood rich?
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:48:36
What an idiot, traded into a depreciating asset. Easy come easy go
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:13:38
Why would Jihan ever signal SegWit now? Bad for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:52:23
You will never get the succ
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:47:29
The jokes is on you. You will never get SegWit because Jihan can keep trolling and rake in money
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:55:40
Yea guys coinbase is down due to all this new demand in Bitcoin. Yep just Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:13:14
Still faster than waiting 3-5 business days!

The core team will never merge it

I'm losing faith. Sounds like BTC is Microsoft arguing over how to improve Internet Explorer while Crome and Firefox are hitting the markets. Eventually they'll bring out Edge but nobody cares.
All core &amp; BU does is argue argue argue. Step outside and you find people having gentlemen discussion and innovating the space in other cryptos

Weak hands will go down as just that I'm the history books. Like theymos. He tries to be a tough guy on Reddit but we all know he had the weakest hands in BTC history

It's definitely not gonna send us to the moon. Not even 1500 or 2000. 500 looks more likely if Roger Ver dumps
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:27:26
BU like what is a shore
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:55:46
Whales haven't had time to dump yet. We might see 1200 and 1300 while they knock out the stop losses and quietly get rid of their coins. Then the real short will begin
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:47:32
Random thought: some people are meant to fail at life. You can be talented and use your talents to make Dogecoin. Instead of an alt that will make money LOL
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:21:00
I buy $100 worth every Monday. When I see the price fall quickly I pause the recurring buy and put in my buy for the week right there.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:05:46
So how does one benefit by triggering the sells at 1300?
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:32:58
Lol u niggas got pumped and dumped
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:53:39
And basically you can sell at the top of each bubble like clockwork
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:32:50
Just the whales hitting stop losses then the real short will begin. They wont let price tank until the smart money is out
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:07:53
Good for you. You're probably like a tiny star compared to Jihan's galaxy
