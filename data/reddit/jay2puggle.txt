Maybe, maybe not..
I tucked the Camel coupon from his cigarette pack into my pocket. A souvenir of the moment where he said maybe. I would hold on to his maybe for as long as it would take, even forever.

Noob here!  Bought in at 4600 and again at 7400, won’t lie today was a little worrisome, but watching dips since September and doing my research knowing this would occur helped.   Thanks to all the helpful posts here.
