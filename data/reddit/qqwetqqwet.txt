Amen. If anything we should reduce the block size to 300kb like Luke-jr proposed, to keep the blockchain decentralized. I'd rather pay higher fees than risking a few miners controlling everything.

Bigger blocks are bad though, they will lead to centralization. If anything, I think we should reduce the block size, as per Luke-jr's proposal, so we make sure that the blockchain stays decentralized.

Not really, he's describing an escrow method.

Segwit is not really about increasing block size, but fixes the transaction malleability bug. If anything, i think block size should be reduced to 300kb like luke-jr proposed, so we avoid miner centralization, at the cost of slightly higher fees

Yes he did, this is his proposal for block size:
300kb now and slowly growing it to 1MB in 2024.
If we need to choose an ideal block size, smaller block size ensures that everyone who wants to can run a Bitcoin mode for cheap, so that would keep the bitcoin network healthy and decentralized.

those are just examples based on example activation dates. If one activates it any time before 2024 the block size would be reduced. Wheather people choose to activate it or not it's a different thing. But the point is, he argues that the ideal block size, at current usage level, would be around 300kb, he has said this several times. I know it's counterintuitive to some people, but a block size decrease would actually be healthy, otherwise we risk centralization, and if fees are too low we risk spam and miners choosing not to mine anymore
