that's what your question made me wonder. do you have to pay tax on an asset that appreciates in value if you never sell it for cash? I'm curious.
I think though where you might get tripped up is that your exchange has records on your trades, so for example they would see you put in say.. 10k, then through trades that value increases to 11k.. 13k.. 15k.. and finally 20k. then you put it into bitcoin and transfer it out, that's bound to make someone think you just hid 10k of profits if you know what I mean.
However if you bought at 10k then kept it all this time and never turned it into cash I wonder if it's any different.

nice one. and you would declare the final result right? not go through every trade and work out tax on every single transaction you made one by one I'd hope.

I feel like people forget that we can always still have 'cents in bitcoin, too. cent just means percent. 1 'cent' would be 1/100th of a bit, or whatever becomes the new equivalent of dollar

it's really strange because I found myself having the same exact dream a few weeks back. it dropped to 11k and then 8k then 6k and I tried to buy in but it wouldn't let me... because dreams are like that... then it rose back up again.. oh man

how exactly can they trace any particular bitcoin to any particular person?

click the little bell at the top bar just below/near the login button and set your upper and lower limits

don't worry. I bought when it was at $9800 usd at the peak height it had ever been. didn't stop it from rising to over $11,000 USD though did it.
think in months, not hours.

If you chose to round to a decimal place of say 5 places, this happens:
0.666... becomes 0.66667
0.333... becomes 0.33333
0.999... becomes 1.00000 (because what happens when you round 0.999... up? you don't get 0.999910 - the numbers all spill over and you end up with 1.)
There's a number between 6 and 10, the closest rounding up is 7
Rounding up .0009 leads to .0010 which cascades down the chain of 9s and makes it a whole 1.0
Edited for more clarity but I don't think this is what the others were talking about. I think I'm on a different tangent altogether.

That's not exactly what I meant - I know that ... means ad infinitum, but I meant if you chose to round to a certain decimal point that it would round up. I chose an arbitrary decimal point of 5 places to round to for my point.
