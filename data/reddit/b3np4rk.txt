Private undergrad across the country with a partial scholarship (But still my own living expenses); law school; seminary.
I'm praying that PSLF will remain but the way that the GOP, specifically Demon DeVos, is trying to screw over the future generations of this country, it's not looking good. I'm a republican but I'm hoping Bernie runs and wins because I think he actually understands that the student loan debt bubble is really dangerous :/ And here they are complaining about btc -___-

I own no bcash and started buying crypto in November. But isn't faster, with cheaper fees, "better" in every sense of what we should want from a medium of exchange? In my humble opinion, Bitcoin seems to just be "better" because it was first. There do seem to be inconveniences with using Bitcoin that other coins don't have; I'm not saying bcash addresses those deficiencies, but isn't it kind of shortsighted to act like those deficiencies aren't there?

Hey man, just want you to know that this is exactly what I needed for christmas gifts! Wish you'd posted this two weeks ago (idk what your turnaround is?) also could you do other coins? Maybe vertcoin? If so I'll place some orders today!q

If you bring something into the marriage (like bitcoin) it's still YOUR money, at least in CA and other community property states. Just make sure you keep very, very good records and preferably your crypto funds in a completely separate account.
Any gains on investment after marriage, however, are OUR money. So you wanna have a very clear idea of what you owned before and after marriage :)

Oh, for sure! I wasn't thinking about it in the btc/fakeass BCH coin debate, but just in general :) I personally have a bit of XMR and VTC, I was just wondering what makes bitcoin better than those alts other than the obvious widespread usage and the decentralization!
Since you seem to know what you're talking about, I would love to pick your brain on something my wife said to me when I was trying to explain blockchain tech to her: If every transaction is public record, then would the government be able to regulate or "ban" addresses or transactions that have already taken place? In effect blacklisting whole groups of people? Or would they be able to just start buying up all the bitcoin to create scarcity, in effect creating a new form of the Federal Reserve?
In cases like that, aren't privacy-centered coins better? But then she asked me, "then in a case like that, isn't it actually enabling criminal activity?" So it got me thinking... if the government is somehow able to ban or regulate crypto, could the "untraceable" cryptos like Monero in effect become illegal themselves?
Sorry if these questions have been answered before; these were mostly her questions as she is highly skeptical of cryptocurrencies in general, even though I'm convinced blockchain is the future and cryptos are just the incentive to advance the tech itself. Any input (from anybody) is appreciated! Thanks!
