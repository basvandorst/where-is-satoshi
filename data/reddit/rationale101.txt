The whole point of CC companies is to put people into debt to earn interest off them.. why do you think they make reward programs? Other peoples' interest costs pay for those.. much like car/house loans from small banks that pay larger bonds off.

Oh, because supporting a free economic system where people could openly trade safely and with reputation is only limited to crypto? No. Crypto was a part of it, yes, but his concept went much further than that. This temporarily removed the black market drug cartels from the loop and greatly enhanced vendor&gt;consumer relations via the forums and rating setting. It was the definition of a true free market society.

Without a conscious observer, all matter dwells in an improbable state as everything you sense around you is a result of waves of probability being intercepted by your peripherals, and ultimately your brain, 'painting' a movie for your mind.

Sold high, stayed awake for 4 hours diligently watching GDAX BTC candles/orders and VEN on Binance.

Luckily we are only graded for a total of 2 exams and 12 quizzes this semester. I also happen to act with an ounce of tact as well (retired army) so I will be prepared to present an interesting argument in front of the class. Our class is split up intro two sections, each with a different professor. My current 32 year old PhD professor doesn't necessarily like crypto either, but that's okay because me and a few other classmates I newly met in this class discuss mining and crypto before class and subtlety rub our gains/recent tech updates in his face.

I don't know why he mentioned it being a Ponzi scheme, as much as it is an entire financial system using interest to create money out of thin air and indirectly slaving people via debt. It is a form of socio-economic slavery.. 
Say you get a car loan at 4% interest at $10,000, and a rich man takes a bond at 4% interest at $1,000,000. You are simply paying off the rich man's interest.

Okay, so where does money come from if not loaned at intervals via printing..? What about the banks who give out loans and create interest out of thing air? There's about ~3% of the USD supply that's actually physical at this point.

It doesn't come out of thin air..? The Federal Reserve loans to the US Treasury at interest with notes. If there was only $10 in existence and I loaned that to you at 10%. You would have to borrow more money that I would have to create in order for you to pay it back....

You’re looking at it in the wrong way. It could possibly be a backup in case USD ever crashes, which it inevitably will down the road in case of another war, even an economic one where major superpowers simply refuse to use it, IE Russia/China.

@_date: 2018-04-18 10:24:13
If there was any deep state organization that would be responsible for this, It would be the NSA/CIA. The CIA specifically mostly operates on its own behalf nowadays when it comes to specific goals with little to no approval from Legislation outside of the organization itself, believe it or not. I have no idea how Bitcoin would last so long under the radar though, but we have seen operations in the past that were more than controversial such as Operation Paperclip and Project MK-ULTRA/Monarch that went underneath many top level officials to include the President himself. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 07:07:37
The tech is great, yes. But there’s always intentions other than helping the world when developing it. Ironically enough, BTC was released shortly after the last recession and bank bail outs. It could certainly be used as a reserve back up in case the USD fails. Except none of us would know it’s the government until its far too late. It’s a genius idea by them if they really are the ones behind it.
