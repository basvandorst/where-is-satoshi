if one was to acquire his bitcoin per say not legally and wished to just sell all of it (1 btc) for a bank transfer (UK) 
what issues would he run into

Going to sound dumb but I don't  really know much about bitcoin , just bought a whole one when it was at 2k , was hoping to sell at 20k for flat deposit.
Thoughts on btc price within upcoming weeks?

it's not really illegal i was just re-selling amazon cards but uk banks are fucking weird i know they'll likely ask me to provide proof of who i was selling the amazon card to messages etc.
had a similar issue before
