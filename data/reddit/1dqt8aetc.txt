I've already made sketches for future pieces around adoption and spending Bitcoin in different ways so I'm totally on it!

I'm thinking about selling prints of all my artworks pretty soon, I just have to figure out some technical things (like shipping as I'm european). And of course - they would only be available by BTC.

Thanks satoshi, nothing really exciting happened to me, I continue working on projects, and let SHA256art gallery do the promo.
You can send me a message here or even better on Bitcoin forum (1Dq), where I am a bit more active.

It took me around 6 weeks to put it all together, from idea to finishing the canvas, which is 250-350 hours of work. But I'm an artist, so I loved every minute of it :)
I take on commissions, but it depends on what the project is about.

Thanks man! 
This was originally planned as the first in a trilogy. Hope I find the time to finish the other two.
