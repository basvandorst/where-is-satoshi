Sure he does. Everyone always says "anyone can code their own version", but this is false. All the nodes run the standard core, Satoshi named Gavin as the successor.
I think there are legitimate critiscms of Gavin that are being ignored. Like the fact that he doesn't seem to know what hes doing, now hes talking about 20mb blocks while a few months ago "bloom filters", solved the 1MB block issue.
Gavin's ethics also come into questions when he accepts a salary from an organization which receives donations from various scams.
Bitcoiners need to stop with the cargo cult and become realistic. Bitcoin simply works best when it is used with other digital media.

Yes. Litecoin, dogecoin, namecoin, ppcoin...
cryptomarketcap.com shows them.
If you notice bitcoin has a market cap around 3.9billion, while the combined market cap of other cryptos is somewhere like 4.5-5bil.
This means other cryptos have already expanded the total supply by more then 10%.
If bitcoin was all that existed, its price would be roughly 10% higher due to this.
Crypto's are highly inflationary because they can easily be exchanged between themselves.
When bitcoin is sought after and demand can't keep up with supply, other cryptos are bid up. When the reverse happens, no demand then other cryptos see their market share shrink rapidly. 
Think of litecoin as a proxy to get bitcoin, and bitcoin as a proxy to get dollars. The demand as a proxy to get dollars is what increases the price.

An early adopter who lets say obtained 10,000btc in a span of a week is risking nothing. Risk is being transferred to late comers to the game.
Hal Finney was the first bitcoin adopter and he realized the potential to make a quick buick. I posted his actual quotes.

It requires new fiat to maintain and increase it's value.

Opportunity cost is bullshit it doesn't exist in the real world, just a fable economists make up to justify interest.
He coulda, woulda, shoulda, are you now attempting to predict what would have happened? Everyone knows opportunity cost has no basis in reality since it assumes someone WOULD have taken a specific course of action.

Bitcoin has nothing in common with a telephone or the internet. Satoshi Nakamoto and the first adopter Hal Finney BOTH acknowledged it as a ponzi scheme. Finny even stated the payoff is anywhere between 1 and 100 million.

Bitcoin early adopters took no risk.
First adopter Hal Finney said this:
"**So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million to 1!** Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim, are they really 100 million to one against?"

False. Buying shares in Microsoft is buying claims against future earnings(value creation) via dividends. Bitcoin does not create value it requires someone else to show up with more fiat.
