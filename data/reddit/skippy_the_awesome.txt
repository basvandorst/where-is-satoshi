Fair point, but one could make a node using two computers, the second not connected to the network but linked via phototransistors/LEDs to the first, so that they can transmit only the necessary transaction information.  The second one can have the unencrypted keys on it, the first only gets what it needs when it needs it.  Writing code to control the optical link is a lot more straightforward than securing TCP/IP and a full OS.

What, build out a nationwide network of copper wire, or even fiber, overnight, before the Baby Bells get wise to the idea of running DSL over the existing phone lines, and Comcast starts connecting people to its preexisting cable network?
Not even Google has the money to do that.  That's why Google Fiber is only in a few tiny little third-tier cities.

The problem isn't that ISPs want to create a walled garden, the problem is that Netflix uses about 40% of U.S. network bandwidth and refuses to pay to offset the costs of its peering.  A secondary issue is that Netflix is effectively in competition with Comcast Cable for people's movie-watching (and ad-watching) eyeballs.

Yeah, it's totally not like the Maduro government has dictated that people register their Bitcoin mining rigs, or has tried to come up with its own cryptocoin, or *anything* like that.  Totally unpopular.  That's why Maduro definitely isn't wasting time worrying about it.  Because nobody in Venezuela has ever even thought about Bitcoin, they just lead happy lives under beautlful Bolivarian Socialism, which even Bernie Sanders says is better than the evils of capitalism in the U.S.

That's where you're wrong, kiddo.  The IRS has general guidelines that apply to all transactions.  Then they give more specific guidelines for things that are treated differently.  If there are no "more specific guidelines" then the general ones apply.  That's how the entire fucking tax system and legal system work in the U.S.  That's been the situation since 1789 (legal system) and 1913 (income tax).
Then we have all the morons who think "it doesn't address left-handed plumbers buying Bitcoin on a Tuesday when it is also a full moon!  ZOMFG WE HAVE NO IDEA WAT DO!"  They make nonsensical raving posts and tell people to "Try actually reading the whole post.  These are problems which pertain specifically to crypto."  They are, as usual, full of shit and may eventually end up in federal prison for tax evasion if they don't unfuck their heads.

I don't know if your antivirus software will trigger based on the URL you're visiting or if it will also trigger on third-party links within the webpage at the URL you're visiting.  So, it depends on what you're running.
If you have the IP address, you could use "nslookup" or other similar tools to try to figure out whether it was IGG or some third-party site.
That said, I wouldn't be at all saddened to learn that IGG is now considered a scam site.  I was lucky that PayPal refused to work with my credit card;  all of the projects I thought about backing there ended up being scams.

And guess who delayed the implementation of SegWit, which was a necessary preexisting condition for implementing LN?  Oh, that's right, Jihan Wu, who wanted to preserve his ability to exploit ASICBOOST, so he spread shitloads of FUD to stall the upgrades.

Dude, we are talking about Apple.  This is the company that forced hard drive manufacturers to customize the firmware on their drives so that non-"Apple"-branded hard drives could not be used inside MacBook computers.
Want a hard drive upgrade?  Fucking pay Apple 3X the retail cost of a drive for one that will work with their hardware.  And the ONLY difference was that the MacBook would refuse to recognize a drive that didn't have the customized firmware.
And you seriously think they'll allow anyone to use Bitcoin as a payment method for their services, when they can force people to pay the Apple Tax to use an AppleCoin instead?

The problem with that is, anyone can chemically remove the sticker and then put another one on.  You'll never be able to tell for sure that there was a previous sticker.  Dichloromethane will almost certainly dissolve the plastic, and the adhesive is most likely acetone-soluble.
