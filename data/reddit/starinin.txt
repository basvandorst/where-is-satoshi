Please provide some statistics on SMM salaries and we will discuss it within our company. Probably I was wrong when used the word "constantly" - it should be "periodically"

How did you count? Divide €1500 for 90 (90 days*3hours) = €16.7
Also, we do not need SEO.

You will have to check for comments in social networks and forums constantly, but the net time of text creation will be about 3h/day.

Are you living in some candy country? For ex. in our country a salary of $1000 per month is quite high.

Also, there is an instance of exchange running at **spacebtc.tk**  
Demo user credentials  
a (login)

Please, keep in mind that the website may and will be unstable due to a variety of reasons. It is running on free Microsoft Azure servers and has a bunch of bugs. The link is just for plain demonstration.

Of course. To concretize - we think that our matching engine software (which I believe is the most important thing) is the fastest of all bitcoin exchange's matching engines. It handles more than 1 million trades per second as it operates in memory. If you need any additional information, I can ask Denis (our core developer) to answer you.
