I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on how Bitcoin solves the problems you have with credit in the current financial system. 
Does Bitcoin somehow eliminate the need for borrowing?

I traded Diablo 2 items for bitcoin in like 2011.  
Came for Stone of Jordons, stayed on accident, made thousands of dollars.  
Watching Bitcoin-related news is fun, but I'd by lying if I said I wasn't much more pleased with the massive profits I've had as opposed to the exposure to new technology.

Out of curiosity, what percentage of your Bitcoin gains have been donated to public goods?

My point is that it is uncharitable to imply people who do not believe Bitcoin is a viable replacement for Fiat must obviously not understand the value proposition of Bitcoin.

You know JPMC has been invested in blockchain technology for several years, right?  
One can understand bitcoin and still believe that a currency that is not backed by the government (i.e. fiat) is a dangerous, highly speculative investment.

No, not really.  Just curious.  
Please do not feel obligated to answer if it makes you uncomfortable though.

Only if you ignore the meaning of the word Fiat.

This undermines the entire premise of the OP, because what you're implying is that Bitcoin will be backed by the U.S. dollar.

The same could be said for the dollar though (assuming "thing" refers to a physical asset with some intrinsic value)  America has been off the gold standard for decades.

I was going to make a similar comment - honestly surprised anyone would consider taking financial advice from someone who doesn't even understand how loans work.

If your friends and family are skeptical of Bitcoin on the grounds that is not backed by anything, you can lessen their doubts by being able to answer the following question: 
Can I pay my taxes with Bitcoin, and if not, what will happen if I refuse to pay my taxes on account of not owning a currency that is backed by the government?

Real question - how will my employer pay me in Bitcoin? As in, how will they have enough Bitcoin to pay my salary if there are so few Bitcoins and so many people vying for them.
Will my yearly salary be .000001 Bitcoins, while early adopters amass more wealth than I will be able to accumulate in 10000 lifetimes?  Is that a desirable wealth transfer? 
I understand wealth disparity is an issue today, but Bitcoin does not seem to address the issue in any meaningful way.
Disclaimer - I don't follow the Crypto scene much.

Do you know how much money banks spend on initiatives related to KYC compliance?  
Spoiler:  It's a lot.

Because some high school kid who wanted to buy MTG cards with Bitcoin in 2012 is suddenly going to have more purchasing power than most countries combined?
