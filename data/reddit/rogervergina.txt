Don't leave coins on an exchange.  Get a hardware wallet.

My guess on OP’s intent is price is still less than 10,000 Euros so the 10,000 memes are premature for Europeans.

Most coins with no users technically have a lower main chain fee than bitcoin.  Simple supply and demand.  Use LN for low fees.

Janet Yellen is still sooo hot

Looks like 4% fees (not including any price markup):

So you’re saying Slay the beast and NeedzRehab are frauds?  What a shocker with those two coming from EthTrader sub

Nouriel Roubini has verginas on the interior walls of his home.  True story.  Google it.

Was interested until I noticed bcash listed first...

With that logic, may as well round down to 30%
@_date: 2019-04-22 02:14:12
Big, if true

What’s more likely is that Roger Ver is every single account on rbtc so when they circle jerk it’s really just him masturbating

When did bitcoin last lose 90%?

It is each individual's responsibility to develop their own interests/hobbies/careers.  If a man/woman/child/midget/kangaroo can add something positive to the bitcoin project then they are free to do so.  No individual or group of individuals should be forced into higher numbers here against their own free will if they are willfully choosing not to participate.

Easy on the drugs there, Roubini

Did Jihan Wu (Bitmain), Stephen Pair (Bitpay) and Erik Voorhees (Shapeshift) get confused and think they were to speak at a bcash conference?

An individual with flatulence.  A LOT of flatulence.

Hey, the bar is set REAAAAALLY low over there so I guess that is a success in their eyes.
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:26:47
The obvious difference being that Andreas actually adds value to discussions
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:22:21
All 12 of Roger’s personalities use it!
