Minimum withdraw is 10mBTC ($4USD).
Hmmm, the lag really depends on your internet connection. I could make that clearer in "how it works".

That's a good suggestion.  This is actually what we are going to do. We are planning to release a p2p option in the coming days. :)

They can try all they like, but the consumers will say no.
Bitcoin is an open network after all. Unlike the closed network payment networks of Paypal, VISA. This means the barriers to entry for accepting payments have been lowered and competitors can come in to cut their lunch (or fees).
Also, BitPay is forever at 0% transaction fees.

I think the comparison should be against other Blockchain proof mechanisms, such as proof of stake.
If there was a better way to validate blocks, other than mining, wouldn't you think it's less wasteful?

There is a 10 bits faucet for everyone that comes to the site! Come try out the game with no deposit!

That's a good suggestion! I haven't looked much into bitshares. I will check it out!

Thanks for the feedback :)
We will definitely change it!
Do you have other feedbacks for us?

We can definitely add an option to switch the unit!
I am actually curious to see. How many people prefer bits over mBTC?

Hi sgomick:
The sequence of bomb drops is determined randomly before the start of each game. We then sha256 the json of the sequence combined with a random seed. That gives you the game id.
After each game, the sequence and the seed is revealed and then you can verify it!
There is more details here:
