What 99% of bitcoin investors are trying to get
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:34:06
A biscotto. Biscotti would be if there’s more than one. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:36:16
I heard some guy paid his crack dealer pimp in bitcoin today. So bullish!! Mainstream any day now!!
@_date: 2018-09-15 13:14:58
And watching profits disappear
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:58:00
Hey this is bitcoin sub. How dare you speak truth about bitcoin here? Go get your koolaid refill
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:03:18
That's when her pimp shows up with a baseball bat.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:15:38
Because it's all click-bait headline hype. There's actually no real adoption. More vendors are discontinuing bitcoin acceptance due to volatility and fees.
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:12:35
What news?
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:29:25
What’s the point of keeping on digging up the past like this though? Pets.com had huge jumps too, but look where it is now. 
Past != future
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:53:42
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:56:53
More miners = more bitcoin (not more possible bitcoins, just more available) = price goes down
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:31:00
Yeah buy so that you too can get desperate enough to create memes like this. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:59:57
I don’t see the point when I’m perfectly happy with my CC or debit card. Transaction is free and instant. I get rewards. I’m protected against fraud. What is the benefit of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:33:14
How will anything help adoption of something useless?
No need for promoting awareness; the world is already aware by now — that it is a bubble and useless. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:23:25
Hope you bought it with money you're OK with losing.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:55:26
You mean she didn't HODL? I thought HODLing was the only right move.
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:25:23
That doesn't even make sense. You lost it all when you converted it to btc. Now the game is to try to get money back, and hopefully more than what you lost. 
If you never sell, you never get any money back.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:35:33
Without the get-rich-quick types, bitcoin would not have nearly the price that it has. 
If you’re predicting all of them being shaken out, prepare for much bigger price drops. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:23:35
What is?
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:14:11
Why did bitcoin dip after this news?
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:06:39
Bitcoin will never become a daily currency because the general public has no need for it. Ask yourself, why would average Joe or Mary in a developed country want to jump through multiple hoops to use Bitcoin when they're perfectly happy with their CC/debit cards that give them rewards?
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:38:48
Damn, how many horsepower?
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:22:38
What was his prediction again?
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:01:23
$200 worth
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:42:03
It went to those who sold. Gambling is a zero-sum game. Your loss is someone else’s gain. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:13:11
See this is the problem with bitcoin. It’s a solution looking for a problem. None of the things you listed are actually of any concern to me (or the average Joe). 


I don’t need to send money to “anyone”. If I want to send to friends, I can Venmo. If I want to buy stuff, I can use CC. 


People Venmoed me many times. Never been a problem. 


Never Happened. This is the stuff of paranoid libertarians. Banks don’t just do this stuff randomly. They want your business. My bank is very nice to me. 


What? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:27:03
Past doesn't necessary reflect the future. 
When I throw a ball up, it goes up for a while, but guess what it eventually does?
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:15:14
Keep cherry picking the time window. Even when Bitcoin goes to $1, you can say "Look, it was $0.01 back at one point. That's a 10000% increase!!"
The bubble has burst. Accept that the fad is over.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:28:26
If it dips below 6k I'd be seriously scared for it, given that it's been buoyed for so long by hype and fake trading.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:06:14
Desperate attempt to keep your own portfolio afloat.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:20:38
Yep, wait until it goes even lower. There’s no such thing as cutting a loss right?
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:34:00
Just because a country is economically shit doesn't mean Bitcoin is their salvation.
Just because Venezuelans are jumping to Bitcoin doesn't mean it has any use for people in the stable, developed world.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:14:14
What a stupid FOMO post. Yeah and Sam didn’t play the lottery and didn’t win the 400 mil jackpot. Don’t be like Sam! Everyone go play the lottery! FOMO and gamble!
 
And don’t forget the blackjack tables in Vegas. Someone won a big hand of $100,000 once. I missed out because I didn’t play and wasn’t psychic. Don’t be like me, go gamble! 
FOMO and gamble! It’s the wisest way to live. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:25:19
No, the loss began when you exchanged your money for the 1s and 0s.
Now it's a matter of getting your money back.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:32:46
“My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.”
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:30:11
Exactly. The public was unaware and vulnerable to the hype at first, which contributed to the new money and huge bubble. 
But the public is innoculated to the fad now. People have wised up, and there will be no more waves of new money coming in.
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:17:35
It failed as a currency from day one. No currency can be deflationary and be viable. People will just hoard it, like all the HODLers are doing. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:17:39
Bought with some ~~bagholders'~~ hodlers' money. Smart selling.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:13:06
But someone told me that HODL was the foolproof strategy. Are you saying that could be wrong?
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:37:31
When crocs?
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:26:18
It's just getting funny how easily BTC is manipulated.
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:01:15
Of course. Pump and Dump baby.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:20:15
Good call. You know things are bad when even wanton tether printing can't keep the price afloat.
@_date: 2018-06-19 12:58:18
Keep cherry picking the time window. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:08:20
He's saying it came and went. It was a bubble and it burst.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:21:29
You're delusional if you think Bitcoin has anywhere near the usefulness of the Internet. 
Actually, you're delusional if you think Bitcoin has much usefulness for the average person at all. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:16:11
You just gave your money to the smart guy who sold. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:38:53
What's the tulip story?
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:14:24
It's smart to realize what it was doing to your wellbeing. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:12:43
They'll just keep zooming out the time window. Even when Bitcoin goes to $1, they'll say "Look, it was $0.01 back at one point. That's a 10000% increase!!"
You were smart to sell at the peak of the bubble. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:07:47
All the bulls happened when there was still novelty and hype.
Now the novelty's worn out. No one REALLY cares about blockchain. People see bitcoin as a failed product, a simple gambling instrument, all the while sucking up electricity and killing the environment. 
The world is moving past this fad. The bubble has burst. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:17:30
manipulation, pump and dump, rinse and repeat
trading bots, fake volumes, all fraud
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:16:24
It's nice to see via upvotes in this thread that sensible people are outnumbering the kool-aid drinkers.
This is the stupidest post ever. Gold has so much more inherent use than Bitcoin; saying Bitcoin can become digital gold makes no sense.

@_date: 2018-06-29 19:10:33
Just because I want lambos and yachts and don't want to do any work for it and want to retire early all because I clicked the mouse and bought some alphanumeric strings ... you think that makes me greedy???
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:30:34
I mean the 1s and 0s that’s backed by nothing but hype. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:39:07
When things go up a little: 
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:45:48
Hindsight's 20/20.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:36:48
Nope, just the world realizing more and more that btc ain’t all that. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:23:37
Ouch. At least it was a learning experience?
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:03:43
Just remember, the smart people ignore stupid memes like these and take profits. They end up with the bagholders' money and they enjoy the good life. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:21:45
Same old recycled shit
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:00:15
Good job! That's how you profit — not any of that blind HODL nonsense.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:37:31
Just let this fad end so the world can save on electricity. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:58:39
When bitcoin hits 50k, I can buy all the drugs and hookers I want. 
Be smart guys, don’t spend your bitcoin - let it climb instead. You want to get rich right?
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:42:52
To get rich quick, duh. Who wants to work for wealth when you can gamble. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:12:10
What exactly does the flag represent if you HODL?
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:11:43
So you're saying the temperature's rising, as in the value will go up slowly? Moon will come, just gotta be patient? Ok got it.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:26:06
Isn't that what some people say in the middle of every final crash? Like Pets.com?
@_date: 2018-11-24 05:09:26
Taking hodlers’ money. Smart
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:00:31
It's called cutting losses. Would you rather get back 80% of your money or 10%? It's a sinking ship.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:03:42
Spending??? Are you living under a rock? Bitcoin is all about moon. Moon, moon, moon and lambos. Was always about that and still is.
You think 99% of people care about it as a currency? It's all for getting rich quick.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:05:41
I don't know about that. When personal computers came out, they were adopted en mass pretty quickly. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:59:46
What lessons? Don't gamble? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:17:55
That crash at the end tho
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:28:33
You're assuming past performance equates to future gains. We all know how correct that is.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:13:43
But you don't lose anything if you never sell, remember?
^^^Is ^^^that ^^^even ^^^logical?
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:18:12
No, you bought them because you thought you could get rich quick. Don't lie to yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:42:40
There’s too much logic here. You’re posting in the wrong sub. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:56:42
All those landfills of abandoned ASICs. The environmental devastation. The broken homes and evaporated savings. 
Good riddance Bitcoin — the symbol of human greed.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:47:54
Because I prefer reason and logic over stupid little kitchy soundbites.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:34:43
It’s called desperation. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:15:54
This is the stupidest set of examples I've ever seen. Are people in this sub that delusional?
People need cellphones because they make and receive calls and texts while they're out and about all the time. There's NO OTHER WAY to do that.
People don't need Bitcoin because there are MANY OTHER WAYS to pay digitally already, most of which are faster, safer, more convenient and more trusted. Unless they're buying illegal stuff, like I said. But that's not the common person. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:43:56
How is babby formed?
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:35:58
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:00:11
It’s heading in that direction. I know it’ll never disappear, but it will tank hard enough that no one cares any more (except for purchasing illegal stuff). 
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:42:08
Read the monkey story: 
These are the hodlers
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:51:51

@_date: 2018-07-09 13:28:56
Lol I hope this isn’t serious. Otherwise, you’ve got a lot of growing up to do. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 19:29:50
So, what happened to $20k by end of July?
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:55:37
Regulation? I thought the whole point of Bitcoin is no authority, no regulation.
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:56:31
Yep, preying on all the naive gamblers who fall for this.
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:57:07
Sell and profit!! And buy back at the dip!
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:58:18

Tree fitty 
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:10:05
Actually it should be:
**The Bitcoin network**
Open, peer-to-peer, secure, takes a long time, high transaction cost, no fraud protection, no theft protection, not accepted pretty much anywhere, no perks or rewards, difficult to use, no password recovery protection, can get entire savings robbed at gunpoint. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:30:14
What the fuck is this bullshit?
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:34:36
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:01:22
What is a 190 millimeter short?
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:46:34
Who cares? It’ll just get dumped back down in a couple of weeks. Same story as always. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:35:22
Delusional if you think it’ll reach 20k again. Bitcoin’s heyday is over. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:29:10
But picking "log trend" is just as arbitrary as picking any other trend. Hence, just as arbitrary as his randomly picked 25k.
@_date: 2018-07-01 13:59:32
Yeah I think that shits made out of nasa material
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:21:10
Just buy low and sell high - that's the secret.

The diction doesn’t even sound like something Thomas Jefferson would say. Do you even read?
Are all bitcoiners just liars and shills now? What a joke. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:30:54

Lmao rekked. You should write comedy
@_date: 2018-07-28 03:19:42
Transaction cost aside, I think the real reason for bitcoin's failure is that people (in developed countries) have no real reason to use it. 
Speaking as an average American, I see no point in jumping through multiple hoops to learn how to pay with bitcoin when my CC and debit card work just fine and even give me perks. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:55:55
Savvy, gj. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:00:07
Now can you explain it like I’m a fetus?
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:54:34
It’s a store of value, like gold. 
I’m just parroting the trite cliches of course. You’re right, 9 years and pretty much no adoption is a pretty clear sign of failure. The only thing that buoyed it was hype, and even that is dying now.

Actually this is a fallacy. You lost all your money when you bought. Now the game is to try to get some back. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:38:25
Because most people don’t give a shit about bitcoin. Because it doesn’t solve any problem for them. They have no need for it. 
It was a hype bubble. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:35:52
Do you really think btc would soar to hysteria levels again? What would possibly be the reason?
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:32:13
Just remember, for every HODLer, there is a SODLer enjoying their money. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:28:12
I thought the whole point of bitcoin was decentralization so that the big man can’t fuck you over? Did I miss something?
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:40:20
Yes, solely because it will not go away. Extremely bullish. 
I'd buy a dozen at least.
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:49:40


You seriously believe this? Everyone I know is staying away from btc with a 50 ft pole.

It isn’t dead, but it sure as hell isn’t mooning. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:12:29
Hysterical hype that led to massive over-valuation followed by a burst bubble? Yeah this is nothing like that. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:36:50
It’s simple. What was bitcoin’s price before all the hype?  We’re going back to that because the hype is dead. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:12:50
so... denial
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:33:12
a burst bubble
