I cannot agree more.


Yes, however I really do hope you have the time to read [this opinion]( ([part 2]( and [3](  which is somehow contrary to your statement I quoted above,  and the inclination to write your thoughts about it. Anyway, thank you. Today I learned something new. 
Edit: as I read again your post I see now that your statement is not necessarily in disagreement with those articles. Nonetheless I would still appreciate your thoughts.

Does it really works? reading your post I had this thought, to compare the market behavior to climatology, and I kind of reached the conclusion that even the earth climate with all its variables is much more easy to forecast than the collective human reaction in the buy/sell game. Maybe if the market will be entirely driven by AI it will become a bit more predictable, however as it is now I suspect that if I decide to invest basing my decisions on the outcome of trowing a fear coin, I would not do better or worse of the average investor. As I am not willing to test this hypothesis with my money, I guess I will never know for sure.
Edit: would be interesting to ask a randomly chosen large group of investors to document every decisions they made investing with the corresponding outcome (loss or gain) and compare the distribution of the data with the a corresponding set of decisions made on the same events by applying a random algorithm.  Maybe somebody has already done this?

About that. Gold can tempt a nation state to issue an other Executive Order 6102 to its citizens. Gold is very difficult to store and to defend from an attacker, both for private use and even more for state actors. Gold stored in a home is extremely exposed and gold stored in a vault can be forged, double spent or entirely emptied and it may take years before anybody finds out. When Fort Knox was audited last time? All these problems do not exist with bitcoin. It's not a small advantage to have, even with all the volatility it has to endure for the next few years.

How do you measure the risk of an index fund investment compared to bitcoin? the 100 fold value is just a figure of speech or it's a real number? Second question, what happens to an index fund or an etf if the whole market, including FANG stocks, crashes like in 2008?
It's my understanding that this event is not so unlikely, especially since it has been 10 years since the last bear market and the the feds just increased interest rates, event that frequently precedes a crash. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:33:53
Good for you. Maybe you can give some advice on how to short bitcoin for even more people who might want to do just that? It should anyway help your shorting, I guess. In this spirit, I will leave [this ]( I found over Bloomberg.
For my part, I don't care. If bitcoin goes to zero, so be it. I bet it has a huge intrinsic value in terms of defense against the loss of privacy and the foolish monetary policy of the last few years. If the world does not to adopt it, then I accept what is coming for us all.
However I don't believe it will happen. As soon as the bear stock market starts, I believe bitcoin will go again up.
@_date: 2018-06-19 16:06:32
I agree with everything you said. I just fear that with a big bear market, everybody will lose their money, even long term, even  in the index funds. I guess any strategy has a risk associated with it, even doing nothing is risky. I just hope our next generations will see a better monetary system where value is as stable as to be transmitted from one generation to the next unchanged, and unseizable by the government. This is why I got into crypto. Of course, I don't expect it will happen, however things can change for the better. I am rambling. Thanks for your opinion. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:39:02
Do you see purpose and value in a chart? Besides, there is a lot of money you can make if you are so sure it will go to zero. Why don't you short it and when is on the way down, cash it and make a nice profit. Then come here and make a post to let us know about your sweet gains. I think you would like that.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:43:14


why do you think Bitcoin does not have a fundamental value? Is not possible that as all the governments become more invasive in their desire to control and dominate our lives, and therefore our money, people will take the risk of volatility in exchange for privacy? When my mother died, the lawyer liquidating her estate wanted to be payed in cash (for good reasons, nothing suspicious as it was done with all the receipts and everything). I had to have the director of the bank authorize the withdrawn of **her** money to pay **her** funeral. My blood still boils at the thought. I don't think I am the only one who decided to get out of the banking system as much as possible. There is value, right there, more than any stupid tulip bulb.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:55:08
My point of view is different from the average user of bitcoin. I don't care about the exchange rate. As long as it will stabilize to something reasonable and becomes less volatile in the next 5-10 years, I don't care if I lose money with the exchange. It's worth it.
I am old enough to see how my government is becoming more intrusive and controlling every day. There are stories all over the western world of government surveillance and intrusion ruining honest people life  that are absolutely terrifying. In US they confiscate money without any problem and with little legal recourse and it is getting worse every day. The excuse is the war on drugs and money laundering. Organized crime  has no problem laundering money and the war on drugs is a joke. The cartels have only to corrupt few middle level bankers, which is very easy to do if you have ton of cash and no problem killing people and they can recycle hundreds of million dollars like potato chips.
These rules and regulations such as "know your customer" policies affect only the normal people that pay taxes and try to survive in an increasingly oppressive state, not the criminals. Then there is the whole central bank policy of quantitative easing that is also terrifying when you realize what they are actually doing. 
Bitcoin is just a little hope to fight back against these unjust policies. The little risk of losing some money because volatility is a small price to pay for this opportunity.

I agree that diversification is the way to go. I agree also that investing only in Bitcoin or investing everything in Bitcoin would be extremely careless.
This is my point, looking at the other investment instruments, without going full mad max, is it possible that everything goes down, not to zero, but down enough so that an investor loses a good chunk of his money? The anti-correlation between stocks and bonds is mostly gone, right? So what about the other assets you mention? Can they all go down together, again not to the zombie apocalypse, but to an  equal or even worse level than 2008, or that is impossible?
I know, you said they are calling it since 2012, and that you cannot time it. Agreed. However we all know there is a great chance that it's going to happen sometime in our lifetime and likely it will be as bad as it was in 2008 or worse. How do you prepare for that? Besides shorting, of course because you cannot time the market.
When the market goes down, is it so absurd to believe that bitcoin will compete with gold as a refuge asset, even with its current volatility? Without having the storage problems that gold offers? Or the risk of an other Executive Order 6102? Now that is so low, would not be a good idea to take a risk and buy some bitcoin as well,  to edge against that scenario?
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:55:19
If I am still alive and this board still exists, probably I will read it and congratulate you. Besides, you don't have to wait until it reaches zero. Even if you are right, It might take years. I wold say, cash your shorts when it's on the way down. You can make several bets and make even more money.
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:54:17


I understand that. What I don't understand is whether it is really the same thing in any circumstance. From what I can observe, despite the volatility, Bitcoin has increased its value every single year, with one exception in 2015. In this context, considering a much longer than the day-trading prospective, is it volatility really so much correlated to risk?
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:20:38
You said "How’d you like your grocery store clerk to know you have 600 btc in the wallet..", today that statement is not correct. [It used to be like that]( but now when you receive money, you just generate one (unique) public address per transaction. Furthermore, there are not ["From" addresses]( when you send money to look for your balance. In synthesis, if you do not reveal your public key and you use one different address each time you receive money, your history of transactions is not easily accessible outside the privacy of your wallet.

Funny, you see a bursting bubble into bitcoin, but the stock market, that one it's fine, [doesn't look like a bubble at all]( No sir, just small corrections here and there. Yeah, it crashed in 2008 for a huge bubble, but this time it's different. No worries. And to answer to your question, I know what a share is. Just an other piece of paper whose value is controlled by huge forces that are far above the average investor and whose interests are far removed from the ones of the average investor. From my prospective, I prefer an asset controlled uniquely by mathematical laws.
Well, we shall see, won't we?
@_date: 2018-06-19 16:25:29


your reasoning is that Bitcoin is either money, or it isn't. However it is also a completely new beast with new properties. We never had anything like that before. It looks like its destined to be multilayered. As that, it could function as Money AND store of value, depending on the circumstances. The behavior of the market to something so different from what  came before could be unpredictable. But I agree with you, I might be terribly wrong.


I completely agree on that point. However If bitcoin wins, it could be for an entirely different reason of the 40&amp; market dominance. When the exchanges will start trading fiat with other crypto currencies the market dominance of bitcoin will go down. I think this is very likely to happen and I expect it. However, from what I understand of the technology, bitcoin has become in practice the only unforgeable block chain and will likely remain the only one to have taken the chance to grow like that. This alone I believe will guarantee  its survival over most other crypto currencies.

I assume you equate volatility with risk?
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:38:29


can you expand on that? How do you get to that number? I do appreciate that you already spent some of your time to help me understand, so even if you do not answer I thank you anyway.

How big is this part? One gold ounce is about 12 hundreds dollars, how much of this value comes from industrial use?
Edit, never mind, I saw the other answer I got from [tads7ads7ads676]( which answers to my question.

I am in the bitcoin camp, but this is wishful thinking. There is going to be a growth of users because there is a market for bitcoin, even a big one, but this is more unlikely than than the claim that bitcoin will go to zero.
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:32:57


Let's say I believe bitcoin will keep the same trend it has been having so far and it will keep growing even after you normalize the volatility, even in a 1-2 years time window as long as the overall situation does not change. Let's assume that I also believe there will be a very strong bear market in the stock, bonds and derivatives world after this bull run ends, however I have not the slightest idea what is the probability of any of that nor a time frame, besides the "not too far in the future" quantity. Than what? Can I make any number-based estimation of the future. Can you? Can anyone do that?
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:13:52


I do, it's incredibly high. It's worth everything we have and a bit more. I see a dark future if we don't fix our monetary policies and bitcoin is the only real hope we have against a dystopian future. At least this is how I see things based on our current trajectory.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:38:31


to assume in this scenario a corresponding growth of bitcoin value is not so unreasonable. I kind of expect this is what will happen when the next bear market will manifest its self. However I hope that a fast inflation of the USD never happens . The consequences would be catastrophic.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:29:16


What evidences do you have to support this statement?
BTW, thanks for the links, I find them very useful.
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:52:55


Not the op however, I did follow your suggestion. Thanks, that was useful to reduce my ignorance. One question though, does Bitcoin have a normal distribution of expected returns? I don't think it does. Edit: also, what is the risk free rate of return today? Close to zero I guess. I don't think this is very helpful to normalize the return over the risk.

Why they have a value that you don't find in bitcoin? Can you give me an example of intrinsic value of gold and silver that bitcoin doesn't have?
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:13:27
Let me get this straight, it is possible to go against the market forces for the next 10 years... by changing occasionally office hours? This what you actually believe?
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:18:06
What's the level of risk of Bitcoin for an investor and how do you quantify it? Even in relative terms, is Bitcoin really more risky than the stock market? If you were to claim that it is more volatile, I could not possibly disagree, but over a long term investment strategy, say 1-5 years, is bitcoin really more risky than the traditional market?
Because Stocks always follow a Bull-Bear cycle, many people believe that even if you cannot time the market, an HODL strategy, together with good diversification, constitute always a low risk strategy that in the long term always wins. However it is really **always** true? For example, what about [this]( dissenting opinion (edit: [part 2]( and [part 3]( I am becoming quite skeptical of these claims. My opinion is that nobody really knows anything about the collective behavior of humans and Artificial Intelligence acting together in the global market and that our own bias makes us forget when we lose at this game and remember when we win.
However I welcome any good criticism. I am still trying to form an opinion on this delicate issue.

let's cross that bridge when we come to it
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:58:30


12,500 Satoshi is more unintutive than 12,500 dollars?

Do you think gold and silver "have a minuscule advantage to fiat money while having significant downsides" as well? Are they also assets whose value is "almost entirely speculative"?
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:05:05


So, [this graph]( is wrong? I read what you said many times, however without checking the data myself I don't know who is right about this. I probably should set aside some time and look to the raw data from some reputable source, if they are available.
