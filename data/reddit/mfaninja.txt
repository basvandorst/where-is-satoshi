Wouldn't this include car wash token,  gaming tokens,  tickets you win at skiball,  cashing checks or even credit cards?  Seams Florida is now a cash only state.

Well he is taking its more just me.... I do it from my phone, we could do it from our computer if we wanted to, since we they are connected. I am not really openly taking them yet, i will take them if you want to pay with them but i wont advertise it until i figure out weather or not it is legal in Oklahoma. Which i am sure you and your father no that we have some messed up liquor laws here and sometimes they can catch you off-gard. But i am pretty sure its ok but never safe than sorry. Your friend is im guessing
@_date: 2013-06-28 02:02:46
yeah my dad was kinda skeptical when i did but he was like whatever, as long as i get my money.  lol
@_date: 2013-06-27 16:57:00
I will eventually but i am the only one that can take it right now. I am hear most of the time but not all of the time. :-) 
@_date: 2013-06-27 20:20:54
No prob, it was cool.
@_date: 2013-06-29 16:46:14
They are not supposed to, its illegal.  Because it has to come from a Oklahoma licensed wholesaler.  That's why you can't just order stuff online and sell it or even for personal consumption.  You hae to ha e a license to transport across state lines. Oklahoma is crazy 
@_date: 2013-06-21 15:47:36
Eh it bitcoin is cool and the way money is just being printed for the fun of it you never know.
@_date: 2013-06-28 01:24:41
not long at all. maybe a minute and no he helped me set it up. :-)
@_date: 2013-06-22 15:50:27
Yep,  when the place deposits it at the bank they will most of the time send it off to be replaced and then destroyed. Same goes with damaged money. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 20:11:53
You can purchase booze from my liquor store with btc.  ;-) 
@_date: 2013-06-21 17:14:55
I was wondering when someone would see that.
@_date: 2013-06-21 14:35:49
I'm in muskogee.  Most people that come into my store have no idea what it is. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 01:25:42
