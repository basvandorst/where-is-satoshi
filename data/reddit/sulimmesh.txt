We already devalued throughout Obama's terms, this would be no different and it won't happen  anyway!

I read the name and spit out the coffee I don't have.

Even hard currency in the historical period inflated due to the colonization of the Americas and the flood of silver into both Europe and China. It destroyed economies, actually.

I'm not disagreeing with you at all lol I'm just saying I've heard this argument before. And yeah gold has serious limitations which is why fiat currency has lasted as long as it has. Frankly for me to park my millions in crypto I need fundamentals that actually mean something and the confidence that I won't lose half my wealth over night. Also let's be real, despite the many pros of crypto it will inevitably fall under the thumb of governments and then be liable to the same issues that other value stores have. The government has the legal monopoly on violence after all.

Massive exponential growth only happens in hype scenarios. Until I see actual sustained growth that doesn't rely on massive FOMO runs, I wont bank on bitcoin as a reliable investment medium.

B/c that's the only way an asset price can collapse. Just one example of literal thousands. I wish all the bitbois well, I really do, but I get scared for those guys sometimes. Playing around with life savings when they don't really know anything about asset price valuations. "it can never be worth zero!" is something that weirdo goldbugs say.

When the network goes down let me know what your BTC is worth :)

Gold price went up during 2008. In fact it basically doubled Idk where you're getting this idea that the price went down.
As for our pawn shop example, I'll take 50 cents over *nothing* which is what my digital assets are worth in this scenario.
As for Venezuela, the last thing I'll leave you with is this: Google search "maduro venezuela gold". Worthless caveman metal eh?

The whole point of a value store is that I can access it when other sources of value are unstable and unreliable. 
As for crises in Venezuela or Zimbabwe the answer is easy: those places are so poor that very few own physical precious metals. I doubt they own many BTC either. They do both use dollars tho. 
I'm not necessarily a permabear on BTC either. I've been trading this stuff on and off for over a year. I won't pretend to be able to see the future and will hedge my bets accordingly. But I'm not going to be one of these fresh-faced college kids thinking they've figured out finance b/c they lucked into a massive exponential growth in value for crypto. Exponentials are always dangerous and inherently unpredictable.
Physical gold and other precious metals have a role to play just like BTC. For instance, I can take my silver to the pawn shop down the street and exchange that for dollars. No network required. In a world of cyber warfare that's something to consider just like BTC is something to consider.

Well it seems like everyone who talks about crypto makes this argument so i dont think it's something that no one knows yet. I think a lot of people know it. The problem is the rampant speculation in the crypto market makes it hard for stable money to get in. I'm not parking the bulk of my portfolio into something that can lose half its value while I'm asleep.

I'm very sympathetic to this point. I think it's hard to say based on two years of insane growth and collapse whether or not it's a great choice to leave *most* of your money in coin. But especially if you got in at the insanely low price levels, I think that it's safe enough.

Libra and whales pushing the price higher so they can pump and dump like last time. Trade with caution.

I'm sorry to be that guy but basically everyone I talk to about crypto says "it's the new gold!" or some such. I live in the bay area so maybe that accounts for it but yeah I'm just being honest with you that I've heard this argument for years now.

Kind of. Tulipmania's reach was limited mostly to the rising middle class, but that doesn't mean the bubble didn't exist and eventually burst. The lesson of Tulipmania is not that money is evil, it's that asset price bubbles are nothing new and not going away. That's a good lesson to take from it even if it only affected a few dozen merchants instead of thousands of peasants.

Talk to GE investors about never seeing price levels again.

I'm sorry but you're off the mark here. The Dutch weren't fighting "foreign" wars; actually by definition they were fighting an intensely \*local\* war. The period from the late 1500s until 1648 (the Westphalian Peace) coincides with the Dutch independence wars where they fought for generations to unseat the Spanish overlordship.
