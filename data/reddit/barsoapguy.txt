keep telling that to yourself when tether collapses and you're left with your worthless crypto beanies.

OK well glad you took the time to watch it . other than that you can always down load the LibriVox application and listen to" Memoirs of extraordinary popular delusions and The Madness of crowds" , listen to the South seas bubble, tulip mania and of course the Mississippi crisis .
still , I think that video summarizes everything just a tad bit better.

and I'll make sure to wave back at you from my imaginary yacht..
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:29:21
yes but the Dot.com bubble didn't scrounge for the stupidest most desperate people with the most to lose in order to propelle it ahead .
what are you going to tell me next that crypto is a store of value , maybe you'll run out the ole means of trade line ...
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:54:10
Perhaps if they Nationalized more farms to make things more equal for everyone people wouldn't be starving ...
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:23:30
That's one way of looking at it but a more rational approach would be to write a letter to their complaint department, you would be shocked how much further up the chain written emails/letters go vs bitching to some teller 
Still it's OK to POLITELY mention gripes to the forward facing agent , if ten people a day POLITELY complain about a common issue it IS likely to be addressed .
what no one wants and what no one can stand are people throwing a fit at some poor customer service agent who honestly can't do much to effect change on a singular level.

At this job I worked at some schmuck went off on one of our customer agents , I mean it was bad, the girl down the way from her was openly suggesting the police be called .
I happened to be passing through wearing company attire and I just went up behind her and stood there quietly with my arms crossed minding my own business but the implication was pretty clear, dude quieted down real fast when not confronted with just a 110 pound 5"6 female agent .

here, watch this, it more aptly explains my negative views on the long term outlook for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:36:55
I hope you found it enlightening . The first time I ever watched that it really changed my mind about the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies.
I know they're all the rage now but essentially it comes down to fundamentals , sadly they're just not there..
In fact the only cryptocurrency that I think has any sort of lasting value will be the one rolled out by the Royal Bank of England later this year backed by gold . ( which isn't covered in the video because it was produced before the Royal bank announcement )
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:58:38
oh yeah I've already told everyone I know to avoid bitcoin...but that's not all , I've even decided to put my money where my mouth is and I've bought a few commemorative silver bitcoin coins... If bitcoin doesn't go south in a big way I'll have wasted my as you call it dirty fiat ...
Have no doubt though ,I maintain the faith that bitcoin SHALL collapse into this Century's greatest speculative bubble and on that day my empty cup for tears shall runneth over.

oh wow, didn't you get the memo, no one wants to use the dead currency called Bitcoin, everyone on here is all about USD...
that dream of a cryptocurrency future died the second people began to think they might get rich in REAL money .
When the cryptocurrency market finally implodes it is never going to come back again and will be widely despised... ( like all Bubbles and manias)

@_date: 2018-01-06 23:46:27
So you walked over to your branch teller and told them this ? Or was it the branch manager ? 
and you expected them to do what exactly ? act on that ? Were they suppose to call up the IT department and make Corporation wide changes because you weren't happy with the way something worked ?
I like how you blame the individual employees for corporate policy when they have ZERO control over it and would probably be fired if they violated it .
Have you considered the possiblity that they were taken aback/off guard by the fact you became agitated over factors a local branch would have zero control over ? 
They probably told you the security story because they wanted to placate you and had no idea on how to do so effectively.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:56:35

there's only ONE crypto I'd invest in and it's not out yet, it's going to come from the royal bank of England later this year and be backed by gold .
Bitcoin and the other alt coins are classic bubbles and I'm merely waiting till they pop so I can drink all of the tears. 
Your right not to pull your money out of your retirement accounts . What you should do is get out the ridiculously manipulated Bitcoin before it dramatically falls . Pay off your CC debt with those funds but don't forget to budget for capital gains taxes .
After your CC's are paid off takes those payments and snowball your car loan .
EDIT : reduce your IRA, 401K payments until your CC''s are paid off and maybe go half retirement funds half extra car payments.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:21:36

Bitcoin was invested to be a currency of exchange, then all of the leeches latched on and now you all say it's a store of investment ...
Total bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:47:32
All of this is bullshit .
At one time bitcoin MIGHT have had the potential to become a currency but now it's all HODL!!!
You know what we call a currency that isn't traded ? Collecting.  (Like a hobby such as coins,cars , playing cards )
The only reason most people these days even give fucks about bitcoin is because they think they can get rich in USD. Am I not the only one who sees the inherent contradiction in that statement.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:10:22

No, SOME of you will make money, I accept that ( though honestly I would prefer if none of you did ) .Still eventually MOST of you will lose massive amounts of money .that's the day I look forwards to .
If you had a bunch of friends who got sold magic beans, wouldn't you gloat when they find out that the beans are in fact NOT going to make them rich ?

Because we've also seen the past and we know exactly how this will play out.
You are mistaken if you think Bitcoin adoption will become widespread after it drops dramatically and most of the players exit the market. You don't think the people who lost a considerable amount of money that they shouldn't have spent in the first place aren't going to call Bitcoin a scam rather than blame themselves ?
Even reading about the Iraqi dinar scam today, years later, those people don't blame themselves for their own stupidity.
Bitcoin is going to get hundreds of thousands of black eyes all at the same time. Your currency will go down in flames just like everyone's dreams will go down in flames with it.

There are going to be SO many tears to drink, I'm so excited!!!!
Although now that I think of it I should really wish for an extended run for bitcoin , a crash now wouldn't do much for me until I'm completely positioned for it .
So here's to hoping you get richer dude !

@_date: 2017-12-05 05:52:04
Because bitcoin is most OBVIOUSLY a speculation fueled bubble .
I mean there isn't even a physical asset behind it, literally it's nothing.
Why wouldn't you ridicule people playing that game ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:23:05
Listen I'm trying to help you ...
Your trapped in the mania and cannot see it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:00:57
right you're going to bash Fiat while almost everyone on the bitcoin subreddit is losing their shit day In day out over the FIAT price of bitcoin...
Not only that, your magic money is now unusable as a currency because everyone wants to get rich RIGHT NOW ...
how are you not seeing this ??????
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:30:09
 Not bitter, I wouldn't have bought at a buck, I certainly wouldn't buy now .
As you might imagine I'm not a fan of gambling...I think it's a huge waste of productive resources .
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:54:27
luckily for me I've lost nothing because I recognize a Ponzi scheme when I see one.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:09:25
Then you're turning into an idiot with your money . What you've done is no different than walking down to the casino and putting it all on black .
For ten thousand dollars you could spend a month in Europe . For about 3 thousand dollars you could take a 2 week river cruise down the Rhine all expenses paid . 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:27:16
Which one of us is supporting the currency backed by absolutely nothing, oh that's right you are .
It's as if you've never studied history never looked at the Tulip Mania or the South Seas bubble or the Mississippi crisis ..
You're the one who's fallen for the "it's technology that's why it's different" lie..
If this s*** didn't have to do with technology you would probably ,maybe be able to recognize it as a pyramid scheme . But because they have white papers and people wearing glasses saying big words talking about technology and the future you fall for it Hook Line &amp; Sinker...

In a way your tears are my investment.

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:01:14
put more of your money into coin base .
oh I don't need luck, I don't have a cent in bitcoin . I'm just waiting for it to give way, then I can drink all the tears : )

I feel the same, I check several times a day and it's become my number one topic to discuss with friends when  .
I literally get a Rush when the price drops..Then when the price rises I get a little sad .
By the time everything is said and done I will probably have spent about 500 dollars betting against Bitcoin...I still don't know if it's going to pay off but fingers crossed .

@_date: 2017-12-11 15:42:55
Actually I did a survey yesterday most people do not have significant amounts of money invested in Bitcoin.
If you do have significant amounts invested you should withdraw at least half of your money now , as has been stated time and time again you should not have most or half of your savings in Bitcoin.
People investing in Bitcoin are just playing with their money nothing more. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:40:10
It's unlikely that you'll be OK , in an optimal scenario you continue to hold as the value drops to Zero ...
then there's more tears for me to drink ....
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:22:23
Mmmm even though this is a fictional tale this helps to satiate my thirst for your tears ....
Bitcoin will fail sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:24:53
You're looking for me, I'm just a regular Joe who absolutely hates bitcoin.
By hate I mean sitting here in the dark munching my popcorn and waiting to drink the tears of the bitcoin investors who get left out in the cold when the music stops .
This is no different than tulip Mania ,the Mississippi scheme or the south seas bubble .
Because it's "tech" you've got a whole new generation that just can't even conceive of the fact that their existing in a giant speculative bubble..
I'm sure a few of them know it but there are just too many going HODL HODL, it's like damn bitch your make believe money hit 17 thousand dollars , what the F are you holding for ? 
They'll likely have another run up as they bring in more suckers around Christmas time but after fatigue sets in I expect a serious decline in the price of Bitcoin come mid January.
Most of the normal and intelligent people I know recognize this as a bubble .
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:58:22
Common, pleaseeeeeee.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:01:21
How can you say saving with a stright face ?
The FIRST pinned threat on the bitcoin subreddit is a warning but not investing money you can't lose because of the frequent and dramatic fluctuations in price.
That is the antithesis of savings.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:33:25
You just got lucky, this is nothing more than a pump and dump .
Maybe you're smart enough to know this , perhaps you believe all of the BS white papers they've been feeding you.
You know what Hodl is ? That's the death cry of a fictional currency that ISN'T being traded and only held .I don't think I need to explain to you that you really can't have a currency that no one uses to buy anything with because hodl.
Sooner or later you'll run out of suckers...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:10
Why are you a long time Hodler? At what point is enough money ENOUGH MONEY for someone like yourself ?
Just how greedy are you ? Paying off a car or student loans not enough ? Is being able to pay for a house also not enough ?
It is a speculative bubble , how, why ,can you not see that???
This is a confidence game and that means like musical chairs when the music stops a lot of people are going to be left without a place to sit.
It's better to get out now and possibly miss making even more money than to lose all of your money which is what will happen eventually when Bitcoin completely collapses like all speculative bubbles do.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:29:25
And after the big one hits a TON of people will be wandering around telling others how bitcoin is shit/manipulated/criminal etc and ruined their lives (because most people don't blame themselves ) . What do you think that will do for bitcoin adoption in the long run ? 
You ( I'm just a spectator) are on the Titanic right now .i'd say we're at that point where the ice berg has cut the ship open but most people aren't aware of it ..
There's some awesome parties up in first class but your stuck in steerage. Your goal should be to make it to the life boats before the ships starts to list , the lights flicker and people start screaming.
Just saying...
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:53:51
I am in no way shape or form afraid of Bitcoin undermining any national currency...
Bitcoin is the most obvious bubble that I've ever seen in my life and it just amazes me to no end that SO many people have piled into it .
really makes me question my own life choices about trying to be a good person .
If there are this many naive people in the world, maybe I should be taking advantage of them ???
Why am I working a regular job when I could create YouTube scams ?
I bet the same dumbfucks who've bought into the cryptocurrency Mania are the ones who purchased Iraqi dinars , beanie babies etc ..
there's a whole subclass of people just BEGGING to be milked .
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:03:08
Bitcoin is going up by the day, more and more people are talking about it and buying in and NOW you want to get out ?
Right when it's about to take off world wide you decide it's a good time to cut your holdings in half ?
Sure pay off your student debt , I mean who wants to buy a house cash anyways right ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:29:22
Thank you for this story I was getting really thirsty for tears .
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:16:57
It's called market manipulation, when even a quarter of a market is controlled by a few people they can do whatever the hell they want , they can make it appear bitcoin is crashing or rising... they did it with the price of silver before in the 80's.
Expect to get took.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:17:28

@_date: 2017-12-08 19:25:22
I've been trying my hardest to push bitcoin down and wake people up to the fact that it's a speculative Mania and the original purpose of bitcoin which was to serve as a currency is long dead.

@_date: 2017-12-29 00:09:20
Well I am most certainly far from wealthy or powerful and I can clearly and without doubt or hesitation claim that this is nothing more than a Mania .
Where i in government today I would enact every possible bit of legislation to strangle the cryptomania in its infancy .
This is only going to hurt our most vulnerable people, the naive and the weak-minded.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:56:02
well like any addictive hobby it tends to creep up on a person, here's to hoping that bitcoin lasts just long enough for you to make the mistake of putting in more than you .. (so I can have the sad tears and not the happy ones )
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:25:56
If this turns into a complete rout they will need your funds to settle accounts ..

With something like this someone is ALWAYS left holding the bag in the end and I cannot stand that .
People are being drawn in with hodl hodl, it's all one big confidence game ..makes me sick .(also fuels ridiculous amounts of salt powered posts)
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:42:08
if you feel that way, you should buy more. 
go on do it, you won't regret it. what could go wrong ? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:43:29
I'm here in a Casino tonight and I just lost 23 dollars so I want to say I feel your pain .
I always lose so I don't know why I bothered to give the casino a tank of gas , or that would have bought me some milk, bread ,bananas , a two liter of pop, a fine chocolate bar ,maybe some egg nogg.
My friend was trying to sell me a silver coin, could have had that for 23 dollars . 
Would have paid for cover at a nice bar. Or three drinks with the tip.
Could have taken a date to a movie .
Gotten a used game at gamestop.
Man I really feel like shit right now :*(
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:52:19
Why would I ever buy bitcoin? That would only contribute to the price Rising which as I've stated makes me sick .
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:44:58
So avoid credit card interest is stupid ?
Paying off your car so you don't have a car payment is dumb ?
Having an emergency fund so you don't have to use high interest (usury) credit cards is dumb ? 
Setting aside money to pay for your self in old age is a bad idea ?
If you want to stay poor then say poor, the only one your hurting will be yourself .
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:35:20

@_date: 2017-12-22 09:39:37
guy I hate to break it to you because your life sounds rough but "you're" the fool .
I was wondering if anyone bought in because their life was hard and they were desperate for a better future .
You need to leave Bitcoin and start watching Dave Ramsey.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:33:53
Thank you .
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:03:19
Well except for their huge mansions and lambos.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:02:09
You should give up your strange world views and start watching the Dave Ramsey show , it would be better for you in the long term.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:43:21
How are you unable to see that your in a bubble ???? It's completely obvious!!!!! 
yeah I'm some dumbfuck who doesn't understand what "innovation" is or how "Technology" works ...
looks like if you listen to me you'll miss out on the next Google ...
The Fuck is wrong with you people, you're so focused on Riches that you cannot hear people saying "no riches" ....If becoming ridiculously wealthy was this simple then why would anyone tell you about it in the first place ? Why wouldn't they just have hoarded ALL the bitcoins since day one ???
Because they need YOU to become incredibly wealthy, YOU are the main component to their success ,it is YOUR money that will buy THEM lambos.
not gonna work for you lot, you're the bottom of the pyramid , if you're lucky maybe you're the middle of the pyramid.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:56:58
That makes sense, nothing I love more than watching it drop and when it rises I get this sick feeling in my gut, total roller-coaster ride.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:33:54
please the technology isn't that hard to understand . Making the right choices about whom to back in the cryptocurrency arms race is where a person's intelligence level kicks in .
The royal Bank of England is rolling out a very STABLE and reliable cryptocurrency backed by gold, I will be investing heavily with them. 
As for me simply screaming tulips , it's even more complex than you imagine. part of me hopes that you and your sister go into this big. I mean I really hope that both of you get sucked in and end up spending WAY more money than you can afford.
The bigger the Bitcoin collapse the more profitable it Will be for me .
I suppose that puts me in a slight moral dilemma, because on the one hand I hate seeing people hurt themselves , on the other hand I'm going to get a nice chunk of change the more people  get on board this freight train to a brick wall.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:51:32
I'm not bitter at all !  I think people just need a good kick once they go down . For their own benefit of course . Sometimes that's the only way they learn .
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:21
You do realize someday the price will go down and stay down right ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:34:42
sounds like you have no impulse control or long term vision and have simply switched from one get rich quick scheme to another .
you should start watching the Dave Ramsey show.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:28:34
I don't stack silver .
although I do enjoy reminding people who do of the mortal threat that is Chinese counterfeiting...People seem to get all wrapped up in their American Silver Eagles and I'm like " uh you do realize they're pumping that out night and day over in China right ?"
I also enjoy reminding the bitcoin cheerleaders that this is a massive MASSIVE bubble ...
when this ends it shall end in tears and I shall drink them.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:24:40
I believe that bitcoin is a bubble and in a giant Mania right now .
I actively espouse how much I look forwards to drinking the tears of bitcoin holders .
However I draw the line at Suicide . I'm sorry for the loss of your brother and a person should never take their own life over money they could have made or money they might have lost .
Life is more important than money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:52:10
It's just 200K why are you even worried ? Relax and give it more time, there's absolutely no need for you to be stressing your family out over nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:05:58
People are well aware of bitcoin and its being identified every day as a bubble , so fewer and fewer people are going to buy in unless they really like to gamble .
History and it's lessons are free so it's not like people don't understand how this will all end .
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:43:36
Did you warn them that this is a Mania or did you just let them all pile in while you sung the praises of bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:13:30
Just because you might personally profit from bitcoin doesn't mean it's not a speculative bubble. 
Like any pyramid scheme those at the top do well and those who come later get shanked.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:39:03
I'll let you know, I'll have my own wealth of Internet tears ...mmm so much salt and sorrow in them , can't wait .
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:29:24
as long as you understand its a bubble/ Mania then you're all good .
who can know when the bubble will pop , could be tomorrow could be 2 years from now ..
also invest more of your money into it .
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:27:36
Actually now that you put it like that I guess I'm more like Eragon , fighting to save you from the darkness that's creeping across the land but you refuse to listen....
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:42:50
I'm sure the way some of these companies are operating is tantamount to a ponzi scheme ..
As long as the sun is shining it's all good but someday....someday there's going to be a bank rush ...

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:41:14
Could be market manipulation ...Look at the up spike back to 15 K , completely unnatural.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:42:42
Like that wasn't happening before ? Bitcoin is unregulated you would be naive to assume that there are not and haven't been people trying to manipulate it to their own benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:25:10
I'm acquainted with a few people in the game, sadly they're the most naive people I know most likely to fall prey to scams .

I prefer to be thought of as more along the lines of Smeagol from Lord of the Rings type troll. 
Please hate vs pitty, when the Mania that you take part in crashes know that there will be no pitty coming from me . ( as I drink up your delicious tears)
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:25:01
I made this because I know most of you are unable to grasp "this time it's different". 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:52:35
It warms me that you've cashed out for a down payments on a house .
It also lifts my spirts that against the advice of everyone you actually know you put a significant amount of your money into bitcoin.
To me that signals that further down the line there will be others like yourself who forgo the common sense of their friends and family on the chance to win it big .
Many more will completely lose their down payment on a home than will have won it. 
I look forwards to hearing their anguish at throwing away their chances of home ownership. Mmmmmm
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:12:29
Burn .
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:32:07
Not gonna happen, if the market manipulators actions were public then, duh, the scam wouldn't work.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:40:30

Not really, I'm thrilled to have found a reddit bitcoin group.
This now makes it SO much more personal ..I can one by one read the stories of bitcoin users like the kid who started when he was 11 is now 16 and has half a bitcoin ..
What a touching and heartfelt story that was .
His bitter tears will taste so much better ..
Some of you will win, most of you will fail ...When the end comes, I will have my bucket handy to harvest your tears ...

Actually just watched an interesting video from a Bitcoin supporter , its use is not more widespread ,at least within the last year .
The way bitcoin gets counted is that when it's traded from one exchange to another that gets logged as a "use" ...
It won't pop all at once, over time it's just going to get hammered down and hammered down until one day no significant amount of people will want to invest in it because of the risk ...

Happy to be buying a dip with made up money that has no real value as a commodity of exchange due to its rapid price fluctuations and dark net associations..
Sell the bitcoin you have now and buy something of value before the music stops and everyone sits down.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:29:11
It's not a revolution it's just the next scam ...
Maybe it started out with good intent but the minute people discovered the market wasn't regulated and they could make USD that was the moment bitcoin died ..
Hustlers gonna hustle.

The thought of this man being able to pay for his children''s education with bitcoin saddens me but I guess there have to be SOME winners ..
Still for every one of him there will be ten guys who've flushed their children's college fund down the toilet ...I patiently await their day of despair ...

I'm the moron?
Do I really need to show you a chart ????
Do tell me, what's the REASON for bitcoin to just shoot through the fucking, roof like that ? 
Did they partner with Verizon, can I now pay my phone bill with Bitcoin ? Or maybe apple pay has taken them on board ? Are car dealerships in the loop now ?
Oh what's that ,NOTHING has happened ? Oh that's right because it's just one big circle jerk where the last retard gets to eat the cookie .

Isn't that an oxymoron ?
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:59:11
You're right, my disjointed and unorganized comments will have little impact on taking down bitcoin a few pegs .
I need to refine my message of contempt and make it more palatable for the masses .
Challenge accepted .
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:37:51
People buy and sell bitcoins for actual things ? REALLY ?  Cause if you switch your reddit app to sort the bitcoin subreddit by new it's all HODL! HODL! ...90% of your fellow reddit bitcoin friends here are nothing more than day traders .
Your made up currency is NOT a store of value ..When the bubble bursts you will be left with something that no one cares about , I.E. not a store of value ...
Furthermore the irony of it all ...
Everyone trading BTC so they can get rich in USD....
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:26:29
I own zero , Never owned any never will.

@_date: 2017-11-29 00:00:57
The bank is just doing this for your own protection ...
If you're smart enough to recognize that bitcoin is now just a game of musical chairs then you're fine . 
However there are low intelligence people out there dreaming of getting rich, sinking every penny they own into bitcoin ..Maybe no one has informed them of the horrific danger of total investment loss.  The banks almost have a moral obligation to throw up one last warning/obstacle before people make Really REALLY poor life choices.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:18:43
As a pleb I have no intention of ever switching to your made up currency ...
Your white papers will not overide my common sense.

Thanks for the links , I'll take my time learning.
I don't believe a wit about any logical argument in favor of bit coin but for once I'll be the one who gets to take the fear based mixed with emotional side of the debate ( haven't gotten to do that in AGES) .
some questions 
1. What is the socioeconomic status of  Bitcoin holders ? Rich, middle class , poor ? 
2. What is the end desire of holding onto Bitcoins tremendous wealth or small gains of some sort ?
EDIT: what I'm getting at is I want to know what kind of people hold Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:28:58
A year from now my answer will be yes because nobody uses it for transactions everyone's just holding it so they can get rich..
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:53:51
I love your self confidence mixed with a tacit understanding of global economies...
Buy more bitcoin.

I'm not a troll...I'm that little voice in the back of your mind ...the one you've been ignoring for awhile now ..
But as the price goes up I get louder .
"Why risk what we already have now ? Do you know what we could buy today ? Brand new gaming computer with a VR headset ...
With this much money you could take at least a one week all expenses paid cruise .
I'm tried of the constant worry that we will lose the majority of the investment"

It's interesting to interact with this many scammers and lower intelligence people all in the same spot at once. ...
It really boggles my mind that there are people here who don't actually know this is one big pump and dump operation.  
It's like watching the ancient tulip crisis first-hand in real time...
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:26:37
Have you considered putting in more ? I hear lots of good things about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:14:25
HODL HODL!!!
That's all anyone is screaming about on here .
You aren't having conversations about great new stores, restaurants or chains where you can actually USE bitcoin.
This is classic pump and dump 101 .
One day the whole store of value meme will disappear when enough people wake up and realize that no one actually uses bitcoin ...it's going to be JUST like the tulips.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:21:48
So far I've got 
, "something something STOP hodl!!!!! Stop hodl!!! You're killing the currency by making it nothing more than a storage of wealth with no real world application due to everyone hodl and no one spending it "
Also "something something high fees make btc highly impractical for every day exchanges " 
Then I'll go on about bubbles and tulips... 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:39:14
Don't forget that bitcoin is also a scam .
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:16:41
If you're a moron , invest in bitcoin...
If you want to make something of your life, go out and earn another thousand dollars, then buy a used Honda civic .

That's right I AM a Republican and that's part of the reason I'm on the offensive against people such as yourselves..
You're the new Herbalife , you're trying to TRICK unsuspecting people into your bullshit pyramid scheme to jack up the price of your bitcoins so you can profit when you cash out . 
Pages and pages and pages on the Bitcoin subreddit that are just pump-and-dump .. any rational person can look at the graphs of the price of Bitcoin and see that something is clearly wrong..
You're the new "want to get rich working from home!!!????"
So yeah , I'm going to call you out OVER AND OVER AND OVER again so that I can save some idiot from being the guy at the bottom of the pyramid when it implodes .

Let us make a clear distinction here ,it was not 1100 people who were all innocent and died , that was the TOTAL amount of police related deaths in the United States.
We are a country of 320 million individuals and we have enough Firearms I believe for every man woman and child . Perhaps you're not aware of it but for the most part Firearms are illegal in the United Kingdom. If magically we didn't have any firearms in the United States I would expect the number of people killed by the cops to be much much lower. it should be noted that magic is not real.
Statistically speaking if your 1100 number is the closer of the two, that is a phenomenal rate and our police officers should be applauded for their restraint .
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:27:24
That's because bitcoin is just one giant bubble.
This is literally a" confidence game".

O.3 BTC is equal to about 2K according to what I've just read .
For that kind of money you could go out and buy tools to start your own business, car detailing (plenty of video's on YouTube) , Landscaping company with a few friends , the list goes on ... ( you'd be shocked at how much money you can make working for yourself ) 
Don't get me wrong, everyone needs to be a sucker at least once in their life because I'm a firm believer that's how people learn best ..
Good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:35:43
I'll take your sympathy, it's been hard lately . I got really excited when it made it to 7K and dropped to 5K, I figured "here we go!" But no, bitcoin continues ... I wake up everyday hoping this will be my day, honestly it's depressing. No stories of people losing their homes or ending up on the street, no one's wife has left them yet due to bitcoin , no one tearfully questioning what they can do to get their money back ...
I'll just keep looping Charlie brown's Christmas time is here ..
