Think of it this way, if I have two employees, and I pay them a decent wage (let's say $30,000 a year), and I have a 50% markup on whatever it is I'm selling (let's say yarn).  Then for me to take home at least as much as my employees as the end of the day, my revenues for this little shop that sells yarn and has 2 different people working the counter on different days of the week, would need to be at least: $150,000 a year.

No principle is too large to be paid back after an infinite amount of time, so even if they never pay off the debt because they are paying back less than the interest, as long as they pay back more than the principle (plus inflation) the lender still made a profit.

If I were them I would have just used Bitcoin as a backend.  No one needs to know that it's even using Bitcoin or what their wallet addresses are.

If hard fork were to happen, and there are two blockchains, do things like bitcoin-qt have support for pointing at different block chains and working with them, or are they just going to break and get confused?
If I understand what you are saying, since chain A will not confirm any transactions I do on chain B, and vice versa, so there would effectively be the same number of A-Bitcoins and B-Bitcoins at the time of the fork, and in a purely rational market the sum of the values of A-Bitcoin and B-Bitcoin should be roughly equal to what the value of Bitcoin was.  
I'm guessing the infrastructure for most of the exchanges would break too?  It seems like this isn't something that would be impossible to recover from, but would be a lot easier if the infrastructure was in place to support it ahead of time.
@_date: 2013-07-18 03:18:05
I'd like the think the more exchanges come online the more competitive pressure there will be to get costs down.  The more bitcoin is used, they can also make it up in volume.  We'll have to see though.

But it's stripping the "bitcoin:" part out of the reference.  I don't really have permissions to touch much beyond this one page, so is there a way to keep it from stripping that without editing headers/footers/themes/plug-ins, etc?

I'm working on a platform with a social entrepreneurship group at my university specifically tailored for non-technical foreign national graduate students to remit currency back to their home countries using Bitcoin (they are also working on local hunger and international anti-sex trafficking projects in Kenya).
A lot of the grdauate students want to remit a portion of their stipend to their home countries, and when you have students from places like Iran, that legally aren't even allowed to send money home, Bitcoin is certainly a good alternative.

I'll probably cash out when I have enough to ROI my mining equipment no matter what the value is.  Not too interested in speculation.  Prefer a sure thing, and everything after that is gravy.
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:34:37
So, unfortunately, this is a student organization in the business college  so I'm the only technical person (I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science who got roped into it by a pretty girl), so we don't have a lot of people to work on the development of the platform.  On the bright side, these folks are all about marketing and creating awareness so we should be able to get some good publicity out of it.
I think the biggest hurdles for a lot of people right now are 1) lack of technical sophistication, and 2) getting money into-out of the system.
We'll start small with the graduate students at our university, so hopefully we'll be able to get a lot of feedback on what works well with the native countries and what doesn't.
So, to address goal number one, I think the interface is going to have to be less "scary" to the less technically inclined.  Wallet addresses scare "normal" people.  So, I think we abstract that part away from the users.  You make an account (identity), and for simplicity, let's say the recipient also has to make an account.  To borrow from social media services you "friend" whoever you are going to send money to regularly.  On the back end they have wallet addresses generated for them that does the actual sending, but the user never has to know what those are.
Now the question is, how are they going to get the money into/out of the system.  Since we are just worried about students at my university for now, we'll focus on how people in America get money in.  I'm hoping, with some luck, the local student credit union on campus will be okay with a bunch of students linking accounts there with some place, let's say coin base.  All of the exchanging can be hidden from the user for the most part.  
Money goes directly from their credit union account, to coin base, there now exists bitcoins which can be transmitted to their "friends".  It's still in Bitcoins in, let's say India, at this point, and I'm not sure how to get the money out on that end yet.
There's still some research to be done.  Obviously if, say, Coin Base's fees were higher than the remittoindia.com fees, then this doesn't work.  Hopefully overtime those will comes down, and if the platform is already in place, great.
It's still sort of fuzzy, but the idea is only a couple weeks old.  I'm trying to recruit developers from the local chapter of the ACM on campus to help, but they are kind of flaky and I'm not sure if any of them are passionate enough about Bitcoin to work on it pro bono.
TL;DR -- It's a social money transmitting platform that uses Bitcoin on the backend, but the users don't have to know how it works.
@_date: 2013-06-02 15:00:22
I don't think it'll go up at that scale, but I think it'll still go up as adoption increases (maybe from a mass exodus of GPU miners from BitCoin), or when most exchanges and businesses accept it as currency.
@_date: 2013-07-03 20:00:03
I have to admit I sold at 3.4, wish I'd held on a little bit longer, but I made like half a year's dividends worth of profits, so it seemed like a good time to get out.  4.7 - 5 still seems overvalued to me, congratulations to those that hung on though.
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:55:55
I have a feeling once all these ASICs hit, and all the people realize that can't make a dent with their GPUs, a lot of people will move to Litecoin.  It'll raise the difficulty there, but I imagine the increased adoption might balance that out.
