I'm on the fence in regard to how I feel about SR and similar sites, but Trace Mayer once pointed out that these kind of marketplaces change the drug dealing dynamic from "whoever has the most guns and violence wins" to "whoever has the best customer service wins".
Obviously these decentralized marketplaces are very complex in regard to legal and moral issues , but I found that point an interesting one

This is probably the case for hundreds of thousands who have casually looked at Bitcoin, and then when we take into account the network effect that those extra hundreds of thousands would cause then this issue becomes even more serious. Big props to Bitcoinity for taking the initiative to change their default to mBTC at least, hopefully this change happens.

I'm glad they didn't do any research. It gave some interesting insight into how the average person would react to this ATM and i'm sure it provided valuable insight to robocoin.

Tried to keep it relatively simple so that all audiences can understand it
* Bitcoins are digital money you can send through the internet like an email
* You can send Bitcoins to anyone, anywhere, any time, for free or for the equivalent of a few cents.
* The code behind Bitcoin is open source, meaning anyone can read exactly how it works and verify its integrity
* Bitcoin is not owned or operated by any one person or company, it's a peer to peer network. Anyone can create a Bitcoin wallet anonymously for free, and all transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the Blockchain
* Since no one owns or controls Bitcoin, your money can never be frozen or in any way limited. You have complete financial freedom and for merchants there are no fees for accepting Bitcoins as a payment and no chargebacks
* Bitcoins are created by a mathematical process that rewards Bitcoins to people who dedicate their computer's power to the network (this is called 'mining'). There will only ever be 21million created and they are produced at a predictable, consistent rate.
* Technology is always advancing and Bitcoin is prepared for that. The Bitcoin code can be updated when there is community consensus to allow for greater features and security.

Jehan Ratnatunga at 1:25 appears to be the leader behind this. Perhaps Bitpay could get in touch with him and talk.

This is interesting and makes sense. I understand they even limit how much you can send to Hong Kong.
-This would prevent capital flight
- "protect" the citizens from large (relative, I know) financial risk
- keep China in a good position should Bitcoin continue into a global payment mechanism.
This also explains why they are so vague on their stance. They want to make it clear to mainland banks that they can't deal with bitcoin (accomplishing bullet 1), but not being so aggressive that they scare citizens from bitcoin (accomplishing bullet 3)

Overall I think he has a decent oppinion toward Bitcoin but this stood out to me.


I see this point made all the time by people I'm very surprised to hear make it. When you have a 5 year old currency of course you're not going to have a perfect circle to buy raw mats and sell your product in it right away. 
It all **HAS** to start with people who sell products or services for bitcoin but since their suppliers haven't gotten around to selling materials for BTC, they have to convert to USD. This is a slow, but necessary, process and doesn't reflect poorly on Bitcoin as a currency at all, it is simply the natural course of a new currency.

Dollar bills too wrinkled. I'll just pay with bitco... wait a second

The problem with your reasoning is that you're looking at the practicality of using "bits" in regard to Bitcoin's current standing. Switching to Bits is a long term strategy in preparation for when almost nobody ever mentions whole bitcoins because their purchasing power would be enormous. Bits would also replace using milibits entirely so there's no confusion there.

The two would go beautifully hand in hand and here's why: One of the greatest attributes bitcoin possesses is its facilitation of donations. I have donated to wikipedia in the past and remember almost not bothering to go get my wallet, credit card, fill in a bunch of personal info etc etc. With bitcoin I send the amount and im done. Would accepting Bitcoin donations help Bitcoin? Of course, it would be a welcomed development, but as Bitcoin grows as would the donations facilitated by Bitcoin. Remember that Bitcoin isn't a political party or corporation, it's just the result of some people developing an easier way to transact money, no harm in taking advantage of that.

You may not agree with how well early adopter are rewarded within the system, but that doesn't make it unfair. If Satoshi and others premined coins then I would agree with you.
Also from the perspective of a developed nation it may be a "step in the right direction", but from the perspective of a third world/developing country with corrupt monetary policies I think this carries massive political weight. There was a short documentary on a Bitcoiner living in Argentina where buying USD is banned/heavily regulated and inflation is out of control, and he demonstrated just how big of an impact Bitcoin can have on the his country.

Thanks, I tried to throw in brief mentions of the blockchain and mining as well so that the occasional tech-savvy reader can know the rabbit hole goes deeper, but at the same time not scare away anyone. Anyway, thanks for doing this!
