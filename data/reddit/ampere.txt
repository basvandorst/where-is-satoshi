Which is why you back-test and find what models are more accurate than others.  Then you can make a slightly more informed decision than joe six pack

PoS isn't perfect, but these problems exist in PoW as well. The miners with the most capital receive a larger portion of the rewards. As far as centralization goes, PoW mining has become increasingly centralized and will be even more so in the future.

Actually ring signautres *are* 100% anon **now**. Evan already said they will not be implemented into drk.
I do not care about bytecoin vs monero vs fantomcoin vs boolberry vs ducknote vs quazarcoin. The important thing is Cryptonote is the future for privacy. The more competition in the CN space the better, as the technology will be improved. Don't let your investments blind you.

Well, Gavin's solution to a 51% DoS attack is a good one, but I don't see any advantages over the PoS solution outlined in the peercoin white paper:

Yup. Agreed on both points. Supposedly there will be an announcement tomorrow from the Neo staff.

Yeah, that's the biggest "problem"? Blockchain bloat? Meanwhile, [darksend isn't anonymous (as admitted by the dev)]( Bitcoin core dev and **creator** of CoinJoin [says cryptonote is a better technology]( But yea, just look at the bloat!!!
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:19:58
And this makes it ok for new accounts to spam reddit with FUD? Because the other guys did it first?

Having many centralized implementations does not equate to decentralization. I have a lot of choices with who I want to do my banking with, that doesn't make it decentralized.

They are selling for half that price online and even then won't see ROI. Your best bet is to just use that money to buy btc.
