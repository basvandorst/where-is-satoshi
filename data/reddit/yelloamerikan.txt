My friend wants to open a bitcoin ATM in his home state. Does he need a money transmitters licenses to do so?
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:20:29
No it was on CCN (crypto currency news)
@_date: 2014-09-11 00:28:40
Agreed 100%
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:41:34
correct me if im wrong but i thought "POS" stood for proof of stake? 
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:42:33
Yea because it's more of a long term investment instrument as opposed to a true currency

Ohio! I told him that merchants like paypal and money gram need to obtain one but I don't believe opening an ATM would require a licenses

Why not just adopt a better crypto currency to accept for your business such as Quark or Doge? better confirm times, no 51 attacks and more secure network? ummmm.... i know, just tell me im a genius

We have different state regulations on money services

@_date: 2014-06-23 15:59:32
I see it in news all the time
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:22:33
Yes I believe it is but maybe the government turns a blind eye to it because they are getting a share some how
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:22:12
Coindesk also reported on it.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:30:48
Bitcoin isn't a currency people! It's a commodity!
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:19:03
Are they 1-way or 2-way machines? Who's the maker of the machines
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:55:53
True that. Time to buy!
