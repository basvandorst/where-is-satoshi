Boy, those were the days! I still remember it as clearly as if it were just a few months back. Oh wait.

I think the opposite notation stems from the daily (mostly corporate, formal) use of dates that don't vary by years as much as they do with dates and months. So the most important thing for these people would be seeing the date and month as fast as possible.

Well to be fair, the investment world is fragmented. Investment strategies that work in the USA might not be the best idea in Germany. And the markets are different as well. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the first truly global investments/resources/assets after precious metals like gold and silver.   
So it’s understandable how this global community zoomed past a more fragmented/localized one.

My ball definitely winced as I read this. Ouch. That's GOTTA hurt.

Back it up with some facts or info? Just calling him a fanboy doesn’t further your point at all. Instead it just makes you seem childish.   
NO company cares about your privacy. However, if I had to pick between one that makes money off of data and one that makes money off of overpriced devices, I’d pick the latter every single time. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:39:11
Sure. It probably does. But in a world where you gotta pick one or the other — would you rather go with the one whose business model is reliant on collecting and selling data? It’s a sad thing that we have to pick between these two, but it is what it is.

Well that’s perception. So, whatever reasoning makes you happy is fine. Same goes for everyone else who makes the pick. What I don’t understand is fanboy-ism. People jumping down people’s throats for having a preference. Sheesh.

The fact that your comment got 70+ upvotes shows how spectacularly misinformed this sub is. Bitcoin behaves like any other asset that has elicited human interest, greed, or utility.   
I’m not saying it WON’T bounce back. But saying something will because it did in the past is one of the costliest mistakes investors make when starting out.    
There are many reasons why Bitcoin might be back to 19k. However, having done that in the past isn’t one of those reasons. 
*past results are not indicative of future performance.

This just paves the way for a whole new generation of analytics apps. Eventually addresses will be linked to profiles and they will create a pretty accurate digital persona of you. Bought something off of Amazon? Everyone knows. Into some kinky stuff and bought something with Bitcoin? Well, everyone knows now. You cannot have transparency at this level for many many other reasons. Corporate transparency is not the same as individual transparency.

Is Bittrex better than Bitfinex? If so, why?

This is the problem with a currency that rises in value year after year. An inflationary currency encourages spending, which in turn boosts the economy by creating more revenue, more jobs, and a lot more. Holding onto money without having an incentive to spend doesn’t make sense in the long run.   
At no point will hodlers be satisfied with the price because they’ll expect more, and then new ones will FOMO in wanting even more. And so on.  
The spending and replacing method works only because we have a currency like the dollar around. It is much like jewellers maintaining a steady 1 KG (random number) of gold supply by replenishing what they use that very day.   
Sometimes I swear reading through this sub feels like watching teenagers trying to redefine sound economic logic with a lengthy post about why you should all be ‘hodling.’ Crazy.

Define pointless. Anything can be pointless shit for someone, a luxury for some others, and a necessity for someone else. Pointless for whom? It’s very relative.   
And also, tell me the alternative too. Lesser jobs? Okay. So how do you earn money? Or do you want to get rid of humanity’s motivation to work completely?

Exactly. I'm not debating that at all. I'm talking about the muppets who think they're replacing the currency system with Bitcoin and truly believe that it's a good idea. I can't take a barrel of oil to a shopkeeper expecting groceries in return. What if oil is valued more tomorrow? What if I can get more stuff tomorrow. There's a reason why assets/commodities are not used as regular currency.
