Fiat CASH is an important factor to distinguish here. Obviously any transaction you do digitally has a very obvious and accessible trail.

How is money data exactly? What could a company do with another company's transaction history that could undermine and put them out of business, like you said?

Think of the physical institutions that will no longer need to exist once crypto is the dominant currency. Printing, transporting, storing paper currency is a gigantic energy waste. Sure, crypto requires a lot of energy but it pales in comparison to energy saved. Also, renewable energy is a thing of the future just like cryptocurrency. No harm in energy generation, no harm in relatively high consumption.

How ironic.

You're serious? You're obviously confusing intellectual property with transactions involving money. The most they could see would be the companies they pay to do renditions or build prototypes but companies use NDAs for a reason. What is really valuable to a company is its intellectual property. Movement of money only shows fairness in pay, charitable contributions, resources allocated towards r&amp;d, overall stability and possibility of corruption or tax evasion. 
You shouldn't stand so strongly on opinions that you clearly don't know much about. It's ok sometimes to admit you don't know something and then be willing to learn. Being open-minded and honest with yourself will do wonders in your life. Best of luck to you, friend. 
Edit: Just saw your edit and to reply, no I'm not. In listing what the transaction history tells in the comment above, I only mention the possibility of any wrongdoing. There's a lot of information telling to a company's current success and future promise in how they spend money. This information is vital for a whole understanding of a company and for making an educated investment into their stock.

I can't imagine a single scenario where a company I have equity in hiding their transactions would benefit me.

I would only argue privacy for private corporations. Publicly traded companies should be 100% transparent. As consumers of a company's goods/services, it's fair to know who you are supporting to know that you aren't fueling something you don't believe in. Individuals only really affect themselves, transparency is unnecessary.

Again, whatever they are paying those companies is protected by a nondisclosure agreement which protects their intellectual property. In other words, whoever they work with is sworn to secrecy and threatened with litigation, should they slip. Intellectual property meaning ideas, designs, components, what makes up their products or business model.
