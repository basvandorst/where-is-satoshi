If you buy now you will likely regret it later when the price dips below what you paid. If you don't buy now you will likely regret it later when the price jumps above what you could have paid.
TL:DR, YeNos D^n O^t BUY!

This might not last long here, I will PM you a copy but try posting to r/btc as well, here are my idea.
If you are buying $50,000 a year of btc, I think this idea (joke) tells a lot. A guy goes to see his lawyer with an idea for a new Brothel business that fronts as a Porn studio. The idea is that Johns come to his place of business where he has prostitutes but he calls them actors, the John will pay to "produce" a porn film with the actor who is just getting paid from "production costs"... etc. 
The lawyer's advice is that to make yourself appear within the law enough to be safe, you would end up jumping through so many hoops that by the end he actually would be running a porn production studio, not a brothel anymore, technically, so he may as well just go into with that in mind. 
Same for you, your gonna want to fuck a lot of prostitutes but make it look like a porno was being made, well once or twice is ok, but if your dumping $50 grand a year on whores, you might be in the market for something else, like why not just start a porno studio and you do the "casting", same thing, but now your not a dirty old man, your a movie producer. 
Now, to the idea. Your new (real (side)) business is you mine Bitcoin. Now you have two options (all your intuition about buying/selling other stuff ... --&gt; Bitcoin would be insanely wasteful, and people like me are happy to skim 10-25% off every transaction, so unless you are ok with 25-50%+ of your $ going to me, then forget all that shit (especially cloud mining) it makes no sense and is just for people waiting to get scammed) you can actually mine Bitcoin, or you can look like you mine Bitcoin but really just buy Bitcoin for cash. 
Setting up a real mining operation will cost you 1 year of investment and after that would convert something like (guess out my ass based on my v. small mining in the past) between 75-95% of your investment to bitcoin. So still a MASSIVE loss of investment.

Why don't people understand that the easier it is to run a node the wider adoption will be, do we really want to lock 50% of the world from running a full node?

OP, don't worry your fine, here is how to make 100% sure your bitcoin will stay SAFE, I am not addressing how you will use them later, someone else or Google can tackle that for you. 
*   Take the computer offline ASAP, do not delete Core  (or anything off your computer). 
*    You are just going to make a copy of a file and keep that file safe and OFFLINE, ok. 
*  In Windows navigate to "C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\Bitcoin" and find the file, "wallet.dat". 
*  Copy it on to a USB disk and keep that disk safe. As long as you have that backed up file your bitcoins are safe. 
*  As far as getting to them, Google, .... Good luck.

Maybe they are keeping some of their Bitcoins you gave them?
