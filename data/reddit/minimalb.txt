That is great news! Thanks and keep up the good work!

I'd like to ask if this will work If i install rcdevs OpenOTP plugin for RoundCube? Is OpenOTP FIDO U2F compatible?

Do you guys still remember bitmit.net? OB is such a huge leap forward in such a short period of time! Congrats!

No way, there is no Bitcoin rescue - we are unable to do 600k transactions over night... think about that for a moment...

Great, thanks!

[stick]( (the author of coinmap) said in February that new version of coinmap is coming soon... unfortunately that didn't happen yet. It's very nice to see new versions popping out... there is no harm to the original, because they use the same principle (payment:bitcoin=yes), so we all benefit from this. Thanks!

Donate button only leads me to PayPal. How can I donate directly with bitcoin?

What is SFSW and HFSW and what is the difference between the two? Thanks!
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:13:34
Yes, interesting indeed. Nonetheless, i think things are headed in the right direction... 
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:18:39
AFAIK you can't... but It would be really nice if streamium would allow users to decide for streams to be public (and searchable) or stay private.

Can someone please confirm that donating to 1GdQJn2DR2oGJd64yHdb5i6fmrtArZ9qyA will go to authors of this documentary and not somewhere else?

I'm surprised this is not the top post. When naysayers ask you how to buy bitcoin when the thing is at its ATH, it's time to sell.

How do you calculate uptime? Was network ever down since Jan 3 2009? Do you count accidental forks as downtime?
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:28:38
How long will it take until we realize that high fees are never going to be a good thing for Bitcoin? For god freaking sake, this is madness!

On what kind of "detergent" are you currently?
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:47:27
If you are very emotional person i guess my advice would be to invest only what you can EASILY afford to loose. On the other hand (a.k.a. __/ ), sell half of your bitcoin for every doubling in price. This strategy may have your "stress and fear" emotions in check : )

Nice! I also like the app UI. Which app is this?
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:24:37
I can only fill the first page... when i click big blue "Continue" button i get "The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading."
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:55:07
There is a lot of other solutions going on that i also find very unjustifiable. What gives?

You can try using this tool:

@_date: 2015-08-07 11:33:40
This quiz is so easy that it hurts!
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:38:29
Ofcourse it's evil - it's not Bitcoin! /s
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:22:33
These are pretty much the only things that stay "unchanged" : )

Trezor allows extra PASSWORD. So you can have recovery seed at one/two/several places and your password at one/two/several places. Just make sure both (seed and password) are not available at the same place at the same time. This approach should give you plenty of good sleep : )
@_date: 2016-02-22 10:50:51
I would strongly advice you to get yourself a hardware wallet like Trezor or similar. Personally I wouldn't put that kind of money into phone wallet or web wallet or desktop wallet for long periods of time. I guess hardware wallet is best in this case, but securely created paper wallet might work just fine too. Buy your coins on chosen exchange and then send your coins to your hardware/paper wallet ASAP. It's important that you yourself control private keys / HD seed of a chosen wallet. Good luck : )

I have used this tool several times for Trezor and other BIP32 wallets:

So... what happened with "Free Forever"? 
Edit: I am part of small community trying to get as many Bitcoin merchants as possible. Check the video [here]( Now it will look like I am a liar, because rules/limits/fees are not the same...
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:41:08
I don't know what was the technique (hope the winner will let us know), but since it was known in advance we are looking for 4-character American name, I guess same "first name" list was used. For second one - again - you don't have to go letter by letter because we know password is a 5-letter word. It's pretty standard word, it should be in any English dictionary.
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:31:00
Good point. But I'm really not playing games here. Someone found password fair and square. It absolutely wasn't me. I hope next winner will announce the correct password publicly. That would be cool.
@_date: 2015-09-18 09:12:38
Finally! OpenTransactions are so underestimated that it hurts!
@_date: 2016-10-27 11:06:16
What? Please elaborate.
@_date: 2016-10-24 09:46:15
Looks great! Is it possible to use only master public key (MPK) to generate new addresses? I'd like to have master private key away, stored elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-05-25 18:14:11
Few years ago I used 9Flats 4 times and every time I paid with BTC. The experience was very smooth. Their web UI worked as expected, no problems at all. I don't know if this still applies, but back then the only downside of paying with BTC was that you were able to choose "Instant bookings" only. Regular bookings were not available to pay with btc. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2016-05-27 18:24:19
Yes, it's happening to average Joe like me now. Few months ago I thought that users are being picky or moody about delay times, because it never happened to me. Now it's here for everyone. Yesterday I sent 50eur standard transaction (3 inputs, 1 output, coins were about week old), bread wallet calculated fee for me and it took about 5 hours for first confirmation. Dear developers... you can scream all you want about spam transactions and half full blocks and how everything is fine... it's not. Experience i had yesterday was my first of that kind in my 5 years of using btc. It makes me sad knowing that all this could be avoided.

You could check advcash, e-coin and xapo. Or check this [thread]( for extra options. Also Fidor bank.

It seems like it is not working in Firefox. "Add to cart" is not visible. It works fine in Chrome, though.
