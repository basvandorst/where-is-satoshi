Yep. I do this with Netspend cards in US

I'm all for crypto, but can someone show me how to have money sent via bitcoin to buy gasoline in less than an hour?

Aw naw hell naw, don't be messing with emotions up in here sir.

Is this in a funeral home?

I'm not sure if I was around the epic badger. I know it was a cave that I had to fall into that contained one of the lost letters

Circle and coinbase are easy but it takes time to transfer. No where near instant or as fast as western union. The simple fact is that until more convenience or grocery stores accept bitcoin or there's a faster way to fiat for everyone, this jab against wu won't make sense.

Wrong on all three. You seem like the type to use your sexism belief to the benefit of attracting females, only to fail miserably at even getting close.

Why does everyone convince themselves that they use bitcoin as a currency, yet the majority keep tons in these exchanges to play with like they're a stock. We'll seal our own demise if we keep letting these exchanges devour our 'currency'.

Or they were implanted by the government?

Been around the BTC/LTC community since the early days and I've sold everything off. Personal entertainment here as well.

I'm not sure if they think that cell phones are on satellites or they everyone has satellite phones. When the power is out, cell phones suck.

I don't kick myself anymore for not buying more back in the day because I know for damn sure I would have sold some off to pay bills or some stupid shit like that.

Apparently people of don't give a fuck about how the message gets out as long as it does and they make money. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:00:18
Using kids to spread messages about stuff they don't really understand is insane. See Westboro Baptist Church. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:34:47
Good or bad it's still using kids to push a personal belief. Not sure how this is hard to comprehend in a sub of smart folks.. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:54:32
Complete opposite.
