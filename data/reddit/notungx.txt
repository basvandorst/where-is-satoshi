Can you prove it's inefficient?  I think you are manipulated to think so. Did you know it was capped from 30MB to 1MB by Satoshi as a temporary measure?

You need to boot the device in update-mode pressing the two buttons at the same time. Also you need to confirm on the device in order to run the upgrade the firnware. I have one... Is the best HW wallet out there.

I did not know that! This is great for new users. However I prefer to use ledger/trezor.

Judging from the address from the top right corner it's an ATM located in Plaça Espanya in Barcelona, Spain.

You are right, thanks! I'll do that!

As I said I thought it was 70cents for fees. Having a trezor is not a good reason to justify 10% of the value each time a I order some food. Anyway is not the casebas id just 7cents.

I buy a lot of stuff on ebay for 1usd via paypal, shipping included from china (electronic components). Paying 70 cents is not an option then.

I woud love to have them as bitcoin decentralized in-chain payment.

Mmm I'm using ledger wallet. I'll check later.. It sounds as if I might have misplaced a zero then.

Looks very interesting!! What about the electronic version in epub??

SEPA transfers from bitstamp are done in EUR (conversion rate and details are explained in their website). They charged me flat rate of 0.90€ and is quite fast as it is a SEPA order. This is the new standard in Europe which treats transfers between EU countries as local transfers (cheaper and faster). Try it!

Hi there! I am developing a simplistic block explorer. Most block explorers display too many information and confuse new users.
This block explorer aims to be very visual and display just the most important data.
I would be happy to get some comments and if you want to contribute to the project... you are welcome!

In my opinion: get some ether as well. Bitcoin development is kind of stagnated. I think some of the altcoins are developing much faster and have brighter future. I hold both. But just research by yourself and buy what convinces you. Don't trust me or anyone else, just yourself.

Hey Luke, thanks for replying.
I understand your example. But it is just an edge case. Most of the time the balances between participants will not end up equal.
When you say that settlements will be made as batch, what do you mean? If a channel has 100.000 transactions (with a final balance different than 0 between all of them) which need to be settled, how is the batch going to help? The information of the address and BTC amount (or inputs/outputs) needs to be reflected somewhere.
How do you fit all this info in a block?
@_date: 2016-12-15 09:17:14
Another use case that worries me: 100.000 users are using a channel to make payments (big Hub). Then the LN nodes of that specific channel get a DOS attack bringing down the channel nodes. What happen to all the transactions? Are they settled? I guess that DoS to LN will be cheaper than a DoS attach to bitcoin nodes (there will be less of them).
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:05:06
Thanks for your time! One more question Luke, if running a bitcoin node nowadays with 1MB block size is an issue due to bandwidth/CPU/storage constraints, how it will be feasible having the same amount of LN nodes which will require higher specs (10x - 100 or even 1000x more TPS than current bitcon network)?

Basically I want to avoid that the miners have their own rules, as not filling the full block just to be the first   ones. I think it could improve competitivity and service.
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:37:21
I understand... but there you have miners modifying parameters for their benefit. As mining is kind of centralized there is a way to fight against this behaviour for the benefit of the majority by not relaying "selfish mined blocks".
@_date: 2016-02-11 11:58:36
And we should also boycott Blockstream!
@_date: 2016-02-11 11:17:26
Why are you happy that Bitcoin development is centralized following the interests of one company (blockstream) which tries to have bitcoin as a settlement layer instead of the original payment system proposed by Satoshi? Please explain me because I still don't understand why users defend Bitcoin Core roadmap. Thanks!

It is not an engineering issue. Engineering issue has been solved in multiple implementations. This is a political issue.
