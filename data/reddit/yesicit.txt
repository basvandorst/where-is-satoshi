From their website.
"No, we are a bitcoin-only platform.
The only way to transfer value into or out of Bitreserve's system is to send bitcoin over the Bitcoin Network.
We do not accept direct transfers of fiat currency, nor do we transfer fiat currency to our Members.
Bitcurrencies are not redeemable for the fiat currency with which they share a denomination. Bitcurrencies can be exchanged between you and other Bitreserve Members or converted back to bitcoin and sent over the Bitcoin Network."
"Sending bitcurrency (e.g., U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds, yen and yuan) to anyone in the world is 100 percent free. We charge a small commission when you convert bitcoin to bitcurrency (or vice versa), as well as when you convert one bitcurrency to another bitcurrency."

I am using a qt wallet or blockchain.info. Do these wallets "parse the pay to script" for me?

Ulbright didn't sign the agreement. Look closely - a lawyer did. So did Ulbright actually agree?

Still shows on their home page but buy now doesn't allow buying it.

You can get a physical or virtual Mastercard here [AdvCash.com]( I've used the card at an ATM in Ecuador. Works great!

When I check out. It takes me to coinbase and it appears I need to sign up with coinbase to complete the process. I would like to pay from my computer wallet.
