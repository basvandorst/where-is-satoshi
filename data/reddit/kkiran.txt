As a simpleton, love the way car drives, pure EV to boot. Suggest a better pure EV and you win!
They have their cash struggles just like they did with SpaceX and we all know how it went. I think they are the newest car company in decades. Give them time!

A million dollars for one bitcoin? 2020? More like 2040! 2020 is not practical unless he was joking or smoking.

Tesla Model 3 is $60,000. That is about 6 BTC. Mining 6 BTC in USA is 6X$4750 = $28500. 
A Model is half off in the Bitcoin mining world!!

I wish more local companies are accepting BTC here in Portland. I have never had a chance to use BTC to purchase anything. I want to experience it locally - how long does it take to clear and how quickly can I be done with transaction and move on with other stuff.
Cards provide cashback, points and extended warranties. 
How often does people have to spend money for goods overseas except for Bitmain miners?!
I want to see more local adoption so we can transact crypto instead of fiat.

Too much for diversification! I wouldn’t call this guy’s decision *smart*. More like **insane**. 3 kids (all girls) and he wants to sell their toys and live at a campsite?
