Taking advantage of noobs and people who can't be bothered to cash out on the exchange. Convenience always demands a premium,  so does ignorance ;)

Sorry, added source now

Coinbase is heavily financed by banks and has a near monopoly in the US. Therefore it is being run like a bank and they are raising their fees.

The average person actually isn't ready to trust it yet. People are hesitant to use Google and Apple wallets let alone bitcoin which they dont understand. All they hear is millions of dollars of bitcoin stolen.

Diversification 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:04:59
Because the thief is obviously very familiar with bitcoin and knows the price will eventually go back up making their heist worth even more. Selling just enough for a nice pay day and then converting the rest as needed to enjoy the island life
@_date: 2016-08-26 15:38:16
Absolutely. Dash is everything bitcoin aspires to be.

Great question. Do hardware wallets have seed backups ?

This makes sense but didn't the market rebound quickly after mt gox

When was the last time that you had a transaction process in the first block ? Wait times for confirmations are the slow death of BTC
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:28:13


Uh huh. Sure

I just sent .008 BTC  (9.68 USD) and Jaxx wallet average fee suggested was .018 (2.18 USD), slow fee .0002( .24 USD). 
This is crazy. BTC fees are out of control. Other currencies will topple BTC if fees don't start declining. Which I don't see happening
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:17:55
You're absolutely correct. Why wait hours and pay large fees when I can use another coin to transmit the same value for less than 1 cent and have it there in minutes. No more than 10 which would be the fastest and most costliest in Btc
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:18:15
My point was, you don't have a clue. Fees haven't been that low in years. But who needs bigger blocks? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 04:54:56
Depends on how much of a fee you are willing to pay. My last transaction of 9$ with a 25 cent fee took 18hrs. My wallet (jaxx) suggested an average fee of over 2$. Something I am unwilling to pay
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:45:56
Miners profit from the backlog of transactions and pushing fees higher 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:49:09
Try it. You send a transaction with a 25 cent fee and tell me how long it took. I am speaking from practical experience. 
Then try it with another alt like eth or dash. Speed and cost will kill btc
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:40:48
I like how the link to the 25 cent price is from 3 years ago. If you tried that now your transaction would take at least 24 hours for a confirmation 
@_date: 2016-06-07 23:13:25
From my limited understanding of trading. ..The order would have been put in at market price, then because of the size of their order it drove down the price itself. Thereby causing the temporary drop
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:47:40
Have you found any good sources of information on owning an ATM? Personally I think one that can swap fiat for multiple crypto is the way to go.
Info on regulations and such seems hard to come by. I have considered driving to speak to an owner about it.  There are only a few in my entire state 
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:30:52
Lucky they didn't make you wait for the transaction to clear before letting you drink it
@_date: 2016-06-12 14:46:25

*edit sorry I was thinking ach transfer.  Local bitcoin or atm are your options for cash

Bitcoin is the answer. More of a reason to hide your money from the masters who decide what freedoms we have

"Ninety central banks from around the world participated, according to organizers. The Federal Reserve declined comment." 
Enough said right there. But if that weren't enough... The fed which is cloaked in secrecy and double speak 
Notably, central banks based in Asia reportedly expressed concern about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.
“It was really difficult for them to put trust in the system where they don’t know who the inventor was,” said Boring.

LPT go to the self checkout. Even though you are not a professional cashier you will be able to checkout faster.
@_date: 2016-06-05 07:38:28
This is a result of government regulations and KYC laws. Not bitcoins fault
@_date: 2016-06-12 13:51:33
Bank transfer takes days unless you wire the funds which depends on your bank but which won't cost less than $30
@_date: 2016-06-12 12:19:18
I would get setup on an exchange with cash so you can buy it when you are ready. It has cost me dearly with the 5 days it takes for cash from the bank to reach the exchange

It's hard to imagine that while living in the US with KYC / AML and the IRS Coinbase situation. I really wish there were more and cheaper fiat to BTC on ramps
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:07:11
 I deposit cash into gdax , buy BTC when I choose and transfer out immediately. No worries for me. Not to say that I want anything to do with the IRS or want the IRS messing with cryptos. 
It's time for a decentralized, trustless exchange
@_date: 2016-09-22 06:24:11
Priority transaction with a fee of .35 cents. No confirmations after 3 hours. Bitcoin will never be used for in person transactions.

Bingo, how would they (government) know if capital gains were due on a purchase of a cup of coffee? 
This is the carrot, next comes all records from coinbase so they can link together everyone with their wallets

Use a local bank instead of the big banks. Better customer service and they will actually even *know* who you are by name

He shouldn't have done the deal knowing that they were going to buy stolen credit cards. I doubt he would have been charged if they weren't using the BTC for a crime

Mycelium is placing a current valuation of their wallet at $67 million USD. Are you kidding me ? Don't you people watch Shark Tank? Right now there have been 100k downloads of their FREE wallet at the play store. Not a chance, I could pay someone 1million to come up with a competing wallet and own %100 of it

Coinbase allows purchase with a debit card (%3.75 fee) or with bank wire %1. Although I don't know if it will block your state. You can then transfer to your wallet or kraken account.
Edit: From new research, I have yet to use them, Circle may be your best option to skirt state regulations
