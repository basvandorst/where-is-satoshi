It's suspicious, but "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity".
Bitfinex should've had a person monitoring volume and transactions as well as set up alerts and investigations in case of high volume withdrawals. API access should've been on separate server with different OS within different sub-domain or even top-level domain which requires a user to check a checkbox or do some action on the website manually. API server and main server which has the key should have no control over each other.
Their root users should've been disabled and websites themselves should've ran in virtual containers with no access to any hardware including 0 access to file systems. It should've been a push system and not pull.
This major disaster happened because these companies did not hire professionals and do excessive pentest. 
If I would not been a specialist in this case I would've thought that it might be malice, but I'm pretty sure it's stupidity. I mean Karpeles was a one-man show and where he is now? He made 1 mistake in script. 1 MISTAKE and it cost 600k bitcoins.
I did not make even 1 mistake in scripting bitcoin withdrawal, but still shit my pants when could not decipher bitcoin key generated by script. Thought we got hacked... but it was just compressed vs uncompressed keys.
So many standards now it's overwhelming... I mean have you read about this hailcorporate clusterfuck which resides in bitcoin  Why not JSON or YAML? Why the fuck this piece of shit library, for which you have no rational support in many languages, is in the main client? Why couldn't it be just one json request ala "{'pay_here': '1345fGIEYduhfe25','amount' : 3503035000, refund_end_point: '

This is all bullshit. Validating nodes are completely useless without pow miners. Nobody will have time and coordination to supervise thousands of distributed non mining nodes.
Validating nodes can decline whatever they want, as soon as majority of mining nodes declare one chain longer than the other that chain will be the dominant one. And you can fire up thousands of useless non mining nodes z they won't hold a vote in the consensus. No default node would use them and any non mining node which declines the longest chain is factually not a cryptocurrency at all anymore. Because it will have no protections and no cryptographic security whatsoever

This is false. Not anyone can contribute. While it is open source it is not open to contribute.

Who defines what is valid and not valid? Centralized development team? Or the majority of consensus apparatus - in our case - blockchain?


Yeah and you know why? Because Majority would decline it. Just like Segwit adoption.


Watch me


Lol the citation you got from Wikipedia says "This often requires processes to agree on some data value that is needed during computation." Something like say a computed hash also known as proof-of-work? So  blockchain is a consensus derivation mechanism after all... And extending it with majority wrong blocks makes them right.


This is just plain demagoguery. [Contribution implies acceptance]( Wow look I can cite too!


In case of decentralized cryptocurrency with PoW it is the same and should be the same.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:00:05
Lol. So what you said is "No true scotsman fallacy"
Not anyone may contribute because not every contribution gets accepted. And the accepted contributions are not even chosen by their technicality but due to politics.
Consensus-incompatible = No true scotsman.
There is no such thing as consensus-incompatible contribution. Because **bitcoin is using blockchain, and its blockchain IS the consensus derivation method**.
So what you said is that Bitcoin codebase is a centralized development where only approved by the owners of the codebase developers can contribute and the owners are defined by write keys to the centrally distributed repo. No one can define consensus in a distributed network, otherwise it is not a distributed nor consensus network and then - what the hell are we doing here, let's pack up boys?

From the time I started using Bitcoin fees grew up by infinite order of magnitude (I sent free transactions and received them next block).

@_date: 2015-12-27 16:52:47
Because it's a lie Blockstream is telling you - customers.
LN is like a hot wallet basically.
You'd still need to use Blockchain to secure your payment channels.
As they say - once in 6 months - which is also a lie as simple statistics show. This will sustain not a large amount of users with 1mb limit though. Peaks would suck and take DAYS to commit the channel. And the worse is - the fees will still be there, the network will compensate with fees up to 50% of the sum due to low size of block and LN channel extra-low-fee payment system.
That's where Blockstream got the miners in - mine 1mb and still get huge fees.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:07:33
Why won't he state the obvious? That running a node should be incentivised as well. Fees should go to nodes as well. Then we can take of limits at all. Ddos would be top expensive and transfers will be super fast.

It says everything. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:27:53
What you want is not what we were promised though.
Blocksize increase is what SOLD me bitcoin when I read the whitepaper by Satoshi. Why? I'm an IT engineer. I know scaling networks is trouble all around and problems and bottlenecks will break the technology. When I read that they are just keeping 1MB because it's reasonable to limit it while testing the tech, I thought it's a good idea. I mean that's what I'd do in the alpha period.
But current Bitcoin already outgrew its status. We have to increase it at least 10 times to have a ceiling to grow while we are still alpha-testing the network.
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:56:38
There are miners who clearly align with the Core dev team as they are going to profit from this.
Some of them I can identify (Hashflare for example).
Please remember that Miners are going to profit from smaller blocks+LN more than from BIP101 or Unlimited. And in any case if that fails, they will return to BIP101 and Unlimited later if LN fails.
They don't care about Bitcoin size or expansion. They just need to keep profiting from this.

I think "Developers Community" should be defined by those who pay for it. So if we have Blockstream devs - they should have only 1 voice, not 5 like today.
Hostile takeover attempt already succeeded. Blockstream got most lead devs under their VC money umbrella. BIP 101 is not even what whitepaper suggested, it's merely a consensus between real devs and whitepaper. Whitepaper proposed transfers limited by technology not protocol and corrupt devs. That's what I and many others signed for when we put $$$ into it, not for 7tps for life.
Officially there should be no need to push BIP101 or BU because it MUST be next step according to whitepaper and previous dev's talks and discussions. However due to code being overtaken by a hostile company which is trying to take away the user base without contributing to the project and project goals it seems like BlockstreamCoin appeared by the name of Bitcoin Core.
Before Blockstream tries to delete all Satoshi's words and whitepaper from internet I suggest we save it and I also suggest you stop spreading lies saying that Dev consensus is more important than project goals / promises and tech specification.

Probably he laundered money but according to Japanese laws BTC is not money so no laundering commenced. Now there is this problem, that US is requesting extradition or something like this and if Japanese yield - nationalists will bring it up, if they don't yield - US will make it uneasy for some reason. So in the meantime they just blocked it and put several gag orders to keep it quite. But it still leaks. Mark is fucked in US because in US bitcoin is a currency. But in Japan he must be fine, only we have here the case of MegaUpload.
Mark should've told everything and called for people's support because only they are capable of pressuring governments.
Any supporting press release would bring problems to US based companies (and all of the listed in joint statement companies are US based) with money laundering support, that's why they said it like they did.

Basically they get money to be and send smaller payments to developers for particular interest (payment protocol when we have tx malleability and pools going over 50%), plus leaders are truly a club of elites who covered all the shit by gox for years, and inside-traded their coins before the goxxing commenced (15k-20k walls in various exchanges).

It's not a programmatic problem, Satoshi solved the consensus problem till the 51% (well technically less - around 25% but still). It's not that easy to solve it more using the same technology as bitcoin. You have to rewrite the protocol to use atomic transactions ALL OVER THE NET, which is crazily resourceful (meaning ALL nodes must accept, verify and accommodate). Other way is to allow SPV nodes for wallets and a network of high speed RATED transaction traffickers, which brings us to the POW of Satoshi, because there is no way to rate the traffickers without trust to either parties.

The coin is attached to the meme. You can say what you want, but put $10000 into it first (not mine it).

Yeah initial cost of setup for Bitcoin is less than for other systems. You just install Multibit or Electrum and use it. But it's not the same for merchant. Unfortunately as a merchant you have only few options.
1. Easiest and cheapest - use a processing system, either Bitpay, BIPS or blockchain.info (in case you are ready to deal with volatility)
2. A bit harder is to use bitcoind on the server. Oh what am I saying, it's extremely hard! You have to keep up with it's security, patch it up with features, hold gigabytes of info and deal with non-multiplexing connections (interface is serial in bitcoind because the underlying databases do not support aio or multi-threaded work).
3. Use a custom wallet creation and depletion code - this is even harder as there is no available library in any high-level language to handle blocks and transactions in real-time.
And in the end this takes it's toll.
It's not that easy to use bitcoin for a merchant as the first thing you want is zero fees, even bitpay makes it's money on exchange rate difference so zero fees are available only if you directly accept bitcoin which, as I said, is not easy.
And almost nothing changed in 1 year... Which is disastrous in my opinion.

Auroracoin is nationalist coin, it's distributed on the national level. There is no incentive for me to buy it ever except for maybe speculation (though I think I'll maybe pass on because I'm late for this hype train).
Bitcoin is fairly distributed. The man who INVENTED it and mined it alone for some time fighting for ALL OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCIES has his 10%, other supporters which did not say 'come on it has no value, who's going to buy it?' also got their thousands. I think this is really fair, they fought a real war with people's minds and opinions and you want to get it for free? I have no questions about distribution of bitcoins as it's the most fair of them all.
Though I'm still not sure Satoshi has those 10% it's almost 50% possible he lost the key.
What I'm against in distribution is how goxxing is happening now. Unfortunately it's pretty fair as well, because people overestimate amateur php programmers writing exchanges and wallets.

Hi, mostly because oldschoolers listen to news and know that new community members will overreact.
They sell - because this money cost them mining on cpu 2 years ago.
Newbies comment and write a lot of comments which comes to creating a sentiment. When a lot of sells happen people look at news, when they stopped looking at news they start to sell also, that's how we get where we are now and whales prepare to buy. The rich get richer.

1. It's just the software problem. Bitcoin-QT and others are written for developers and geeks, not consumers. Different terms are required for confirmations, fee's, send and receive (WTH is this by the way? it should be Pay and the receive wallet should be displayed right there somewhere all the time). Etc...
2. It's achievable with hardware and software.
3. This happens in real-world all the time. Otherwise you would not be accustomed with Enron, Sub-prime, Lehman Brothers... Get used to it, amateurs will die out, though the security problem must be addressed.
People are treating Bitcoin as a normal currency, it IS NOT, it's a new way. It's an antibanking system, do not put it into banks.
4. This is possible as currently it's settled worldwide for online services (e.g. selling your debts to loansharks who will kick the asses of BFL and others). It's just nobody has thought about this.

Actually Bitcoin traceability is a faux thing. If you buy from local sellers - nobody will find out anything (unless you don't do it quietly).
It's just in point of connection to bank it's as traceable as the bank account you send money from, so if you have fake data - it is easy to do that anonymous as well.

I think this idiot girl doxxed Satoshi's drop.
If you don't know what a drop is - basically it's a real living/dead human who's data and identity you obtain somehow (either social engineering, money, power or hacking).
Many hackers have at least 1-2 drops all the time through which they communicate with the real world.
It might have been Mr. Nakamoto's router at fault or a virus which made him available to the hacker.
Dorian's background is engineering, he did not work with computers or programming, he was working on rocket science technology. C++ programming (I presume if it was him he woud use either ASM, COBOL, FORTRAN, LISP, maybe C but not C++) - the beloved language of real hardware/software hackers - is not used in rocketry because it's an additional abstraction, not to mention it's invention happened much later.
IP I found in Hal Finney's logs leads to somewhere in LA, Dorian probably could've been a drop.
Cryptography and Programming is essentially whitehat hacker's tools. That's what they are mostly interested in for cases of penetration. And they don't invent new algorithms, rather search for mistakes in current ones and write exploits. It perfectly fits good usage of current cryptographic technologies in Bitcoin with perfect academia C++ programming style.

In terms of Bitcoin Exchanges - it's just a precaution, because to conduct business in Europe without police disruption while receiving large amounts of money it is easier to get all data from customers than get your business stopped for investigation of illegitimate funds.

First of all, SMTP has SPAM issue for very long time - it has never been fixed. But still E-Mail is accepted by governments as a legitimate way.
HTTP has a DDoS problems INSIDE the protocol which have NEVER been fixed. Only HTTP 2.0 MAY address them, but it's a complete binary rewrite proposition, meaning it WILL HAVE NEW SECURITY AND OTHER BUGS. Besides HTTP has 0 source-destination registration (sessions) meaning the system has the biggest flaw. While developing HTTP the creator thought of library, not interactive superapplications we have now.
Bitcoin is just starting. The version is 0.9 soon to be.
Have you heard of HTTP 0.9 bullshit? No? Well because when it was it was a HUGE problem to every developer until HTTP 1.1 and 1.2 hit the party. Which were a huge upgrade to the system.
But more, have you heard of FTP protocol? It was VERY popular, now it's being replaced by a clusterfuck of DAVFS systems and etc (dropbox and others). FTP protocol is pretty perfect. But it has the same problem of security which was fixed with SSL FTP and SFTP. Still, it is being replaced by P2P.
Currently payments are processed through HTTP or binary proprietary protocols. Bitcoin brought a whole new P2P protocol into game.

THe problem is the pool owner might've invested really small amounts, but an ability to buy an island and fuckover all bitcoin and related stuff might be more interesting for him. Sometimes people act rationally to the common cause, but more than often they act rational towards their own interests. It might occur to the pool owners in Ukraine that it's better to have a castle with millions in Europe, than some bitcoin pool with a currency which is so easily destroyed (with 50%+ of ownership)...

They allow you to create addresses and check balances. Meaning your website can be split into to separate uses, one creating the private+public keys and sending them to you without keeping on the system another part will check the balance.
Or you can precreate the public-private keys in a safe environment and just supply the keys.
One thing - you can accept fundings to only 1 wallet to simplify everything that does not hinder your security a lot unless you use the money stored on the wallet (so sign something else with the private key allowing penetration for quantum algorithms).

It's not the feel it's how actually the economics work. If you have money to exchange for money you have different incentives of that livestock trader.

Thus you will stabilize the markets by pulling the price contrary to the currency market.

Uber airbnb and tesla are companies and not software. Why won't they regulate php then? Or C? Or Linux? All of these are open source programs same as bitcoin. The tokens are basically keys to sign the language actions. Now that would be fun to have tax on each and every for loop.
I don't seem to recall people having to show their payment history, ssn, id's to pay using cash. But with bitcoin is somehow completely required. Is it a currency? According to tax authorities it is commodity, but according to regulators it is a currency. Well if this is not a conspiracy against bitcoin by choosing the harshest legal tools against free speech tokens I don't know what's that.
My country authorities say it's nothing of value. Meaning that exactly what it is. These tokens are in the network, they work only there, anyone can duplicate or replicate the network and start their own bitcoin. And if some weirdo wants to pay for it, well if he pays vat on that it's ok. But USA regulators basically treated it the worst way possible.
The only thing to do in my country is to make it vat exempt. In USA you have to do crazy job to make it as it must be.

Do you have any evidence on your pc? This is troubling, is your business a registered one or you are a sole entrepreneur? Because in the latter way other type of police work might happen (like your own now). See they treat you with additional suspicion. And you can't blame them. Your average cop probably has no idea about bitcoin apart for public media info. What I suggest is to educate your officer and solicitor on bitcoins as well as the type of work. Plus ask the solicitor whether it would help you to cooperate, and how you should do it so you can return your data back ASAP.
Remember the chance they really oppress you is really low. It's just might be an extreme misunderstanding. False positives happen all the time.

Bitcoin is a digital cash system, it's more of a replacement for banking primary function and hard currency than e-money.
It's actually pretty convenient and it's adoption would be on the rise if most of the EBA pointed risks would be mitigated.
Bitcoin is not a replacement for cards or paypal, in fact these options are still possible with bitcoin, like when you send funds inside blockchain.info or alike. Unless we get a killer app which will be a cards replacement allowing INSTANT payment verification.
For example setup a multi-transaction where collateral is specified by one person who LENDS COINS to the card app individual and he can pay with them while sending coins to the card app lender. It actually could be a real running self-enforcing machine. You lend coins for instant payment using green addresses OR pre-calculated private keys of different values, you get your defined transaction fee for that, request the payment from the user while simultaneously give the private key of the closest sum to another lender who has the closest sum, the shop will then either receive the actual sum or reimburse it. Works like a card network and instantly - and almost all of it is programmable through bitcoin.

What people understood if you make a currency and keep the inflation/deflation inbound, regulate to hell the markets then people would be happy and they would live off better which would make everyone happy and live better. But what about constant printing press? Well no one gives a fuck. After 50-60 years countries can sell the debt and mutually forgive the debt to each other for sake of forgetting about this debt, like you forget it to your friend. Because it does not matter, because psychologically people count in numbers and it leaves a mark, but the value remains the same and it does not matter in the end because all you need as a ruler is performance not wealth. And performance is the right balance of consumption and work which is modulated by currency.

The support in Bitcoin is another thing than in Gold or else.
Because of the time frame things happen fast here. So if we see the 10k wall being GLOATED really fast at 400 then some shadow whale will turn a wall at 390 etc.
Last time we went through the $500 wall of 10KBTC the breach went to 400 because the pressure was really huge, but the support was huge too (though shadowy). Many of those who bought in also sold immediately to buy at a cheaper price trying to get better prices any moment. That's why we rebounded. Now we can go to $200 because if China quits $300 will be our possibility and no one would allow price to drop to less than $260. Otherwise some huge whales might start to sell (the guys who bought in last time) and we might go into $120-90...

There are plenty of better options than those forums. PHP on it's own has numerous bugs and security issues, using languages like Python or Java would allow better control of the variables and internals.
As a python programmer I can say:
Python capabilities allow virtually any type of security levels including jails and MACs out of the box. If using some microframework - alike bottlepy or flask and setup secure environment using basic unix right management and maybe chroot or jail half of the hacks would be virtually impossible. Other part would be smart management of database (1 jail for reader wsgi, 1 jail for writer) and segmentation of active data for the user in different databases/tables and different users with rights according to those tables/databases.
The forum software is one of the easiest ones, one or two levels above todo/guestbooks.

From a businessman's stand point I think that is because
a) it compensates the fees of cc's and PayPal by the novelty users
b) most cc processors and PayPal forbid uncompetitive price change against other systems.
I'm saying this as a business owner which accepts bitcoin. Even promo codes giving advantage to other systems are forbidden nowadays according to paypal ToS. I'd rather receive SEPA instead of PayPal and cc's and bitcoin. Bitcoin is the last in the list of fungible units in this case. As a business owner you have only option to sell coins ASAP to get local currency to pay taxes and your distributors. Any company stating they are keeping part of coins are doing it for publicity. As well as accepting bitcoin is also for free publicity mostly.
As a business we accept bitcoins just for the sake of capturing the audience. And that's not bad, but in terms of easiness of usage for customers bitcoin has a long way ahead and loses to PayPal and cc's in most aspects. Users don't care about inner workings of your system. They want to transfer fast, easy, automated, hassle-free and secure. That's what bitcoin suggests to provide but fails.

It only takes one mistake for the Bitcoin core team for the price to go down in flames and all cryptocurrencies get back into pandora box for good. People are constantly pen-testing the systems of Bitcoin. If it is broken it will be protocol disaster rendering system obsolete. It's not enforced in any way.
Religion or government on the contrary enforces the authority by lies and armed men even if it is in the wrong.
In Bitcoin's protocol the only enforcing authority is algorithm and it is decentralized. Everything else is built above and can be completely destroyed. While there is Bitcoin wallet software there is also electrum, multibit, gocoin, libbitcoin, bitsofproof, protocoin, or even paper if you are good at maths or have a calculator handy. If you don't understand this, then you should stop using cryptocurrencies until you get smart enough. It's a difficult concept for someone not willing to understand.

In my country moving any funds implies tax with which banks as well take their procent. I pay around $7 for internal transfers and around $50-100 (depends on amount) for international transfers. I'm using the cheapest banks in country. It's in EU. So everytime I pay taxes I pay around $27 just for the transfers. Also all my card purchases have a fee of 15 cents per payment plus previous payment. So if I buy in 1 month 10 products I get a rate of 15+30+45+60... I know in other countries it's different but here it is this way. Also PayPal does not provide seller protection here and when it sends money it requires conversion which takes 14% of my earnings. Even with volatility bitcoin is far cheaper.

That's pretty simple, because bitcoin exposes that current financial system is build on TRUST only (how the trust is backed is another question).
And that trust is trembling every day, because the financial system is built for constant growth, not population shrinkage (like it is happening in developed countries).
So people who are wary of the things to come are afraid and when you are frightened you go into full delusion mode (like bitcoiners when it goes down or up really fast).
TL;DR: people are delusional about current economies leading to them being frightened and aggressive
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:02:50
For pre-singularity time Bitcoin is **perfect**.
See inflationary money were made for super-fast growing industry and economy. But the shift in minds of wealthy people of the world is that we don't need more people and we don't need to buy crap we don't use (unlike "babyboom" hoarders).
Current system only works because of India and China and before that due to Japan and South Korea (and the Asian crisis happened due to deflation STILL coming into play in said countries) and before that due to recovering Europe, Soviet Union and USA.
Currently only India and China grow due to poorness of the people when that stops there might be Africa but what's next? That's why there is more surviellance and more terrorist groups trying to instigate more wars in the world. Because rich and in power understand that their system works **only in bubbles** and when the glass is full and you want just one sip you don't drink it whole, you spill most of it.
Making people scarcer and demand less they can restart the boom and get more money and consequentally power.
First of all, there **never was a true deflationary currency in the world**. Ever. Anyone saying otherwise is a liar and he knows it.
That means there are no true statistics and indicators of how it will work and anything the economists are saying is just cheap talk.
"But but gold!!!" - oh come on, one country has gold, another none, one has power over other, BOOM! the poorer country finds a gold mine, thus power of one country over another falls proportionately. So gold is not deflationary currency.
"Oil!!!" - well oil has actually a huge cartel like DeBeers with diamonds which is named OPEC. Meaning that is basically physical item artificially limited (or unlimited like now) to control world economies. It's not deflationary as new sources of oil might be found anywhere on the planet.
Can the world be controlled with Bitcoin by one entity? This is more doubtful than other options we ever had.
I'm sure Bitcoin will cease to exist before we reach 21 million but not due to it's invalidity probably but more because we will reach, one way or another, technical singularity after which the elimination of poor state will be a question of time bringing all to moderate wealth or even economic equilibrium and post-scarcity society.
"Then why" - you will ask me - "all economists don't like bitcoin?". The question is the same as to why the luddites existed, why the military does not want to cut spending. Because their relevancy and their education depends on the current system. **Because in the run to ultimate capitalism and automatisation they are currently FIRST on the list**. They and lawyers and government officials, everyone previous generations deemed "necessary evil", everyone can be replaced by blockchain.
"But it can't happen, it can't be, it never happened before!" Internet came out of nowhere as well as Napster, eMule, Torrents. Now we live in the world where unnecessary middlemen keep making themselves necessary by using previously gotten power and wealth and corruption and your privacy is a sieve.
Just so they have the money and jobs to keep the public busy. The collapse is inevitable. Rich need it and want it. That's why they are buying gateway places and airstrips with private jets. But they don't understand that it will bring their ultimate undoing.

The problem is all you notice is negative affects of THIRD PARTIES.
It's like saying, well:
- As certain forex market was hacked, guess the currencies traded on it are lost cause.
- Look one country is not accepting that currency, it's probably lost cause.
- There is no way to tell how many early adopters cashed out. But early fiat currency adopters should've cashed out mostly.
- Once again you are trying to paint bitcoin negative with third parties. I mean Lehman Brothers, come on.
- They are just gateways and not crucial part of the network, bitcoin lived without them (and it's true, the price is just a wow effect if we look at the adoption).
- How Average Joe understands credit cards and online banking? Bitcoin surely can be eased down to these levels (it's actually easier to do than to fiat, it's just no one is going to do it now).
- Companies seek profit, hoarders seek future profit, Bitcoin seeks nothing. Bitcoins on their own are just stock of Bitcoin meta-company, they can be worth a penny and still serve their purpose in sidechains or 3rd party markets.
- Why wouldn't they? If I can, I try to use bitcoin because it's instant and cheap:
1. That's temporary (due to low number of ATM's)
2. He will be able to use the private key he receives from atm, even convert it using smartphone digitally and automagically transfer to a safer storage. Build this app?
3. He might be buying with USD asset, meaning a pegged to dollar counterparty asset (or sidechain asset). Build this app!?
4. Depends on seller, some do refund. But frankly as a business owner I hate Paypal because they do not honour every country's laws (in my country I can set no return policy, which I do set in ToS, however paypal still passes this shit through). I accept paypal because of the user base, not because I like it or want it. Bitcoin is being accepted because of the user base.
Bitcoin is definitely here not to solve wars or poverty. It's a highly sophisticated tool to achieve consensus on the WORLDWIDE SCALE. Something never achieved before. And it is easy, secured and ultra-insured in it's own. Countries can have the control by using sidechain assets or counter-party assets.

That does not matter. When you implement a payment gateway every other payment system says it's confirmation time is **immediate**.
Only Bitcoin allows to choose from **1 confirmation (~10 minutes best case)** to 6 (~60 minutes). And that's the truth you can check any ecommerce module out there (I had blockchain, bitpay, bips).
Of course the devs follow the spec, and then you have coffee with 10 minutes timeframe which is UNACCEPTABLE nowadays.
Plus lower sums are really the one which if something ever going to be double-spent are going to be double-spent because low risk high yield. So look at around $400 tops in payments. Nobody is going to double spend $10-100k because it's high-profile and waiting 30-60 minutes would be ok for that.
And I probably understand more in Bitcoin than you. You are only 1 year on reddit and not sure how much time you are in BTC. The day I bought first coins (that was 2 years ago before April bubble) is also the day I read the whitepaper and implemented few tools in python for bitcoin.
10 minutes in unacceptable nowadays. 10 minutes is too long. 10 minutes is how much I won't be waiting. And that is the default. You forget that banks and card processors check the payment fraudulence not the payment actual transfer. Because actual hold is placed on funds immediately by bank.
If you are going to pay by card for coffee it is certainly faster and less fraudulent than accepting Bitcoin currently. Because Bitcoin transaction pool is not protected medium and you CAN doublespend by sending data to the processor node first then to miners next even with faking dates.
Once again nobody cares about how the engine works. If it's slow no one will use it even if it's correct and right instead of the other.

I suggest you wait for sidechains. Bitcoin itself is not a currency, it's a protocol with limited tokens (because only limited tokens can give trust security making it costly to hack it). The investment part and hodlers just buy but never trade, because of this the price swings crazily.
For example Alice buys 10k coins bringing the price to $400 now, then Bob sells his mined 3000 and bitcoin returns deeper into abyss, because there is no floor. Same happens at microscale.
I suggest not to look into the markets for real price because I can say 100% it's a fiction (no matter what anyone says here).
Why it's a fiction? Because there is no way to find out real bitcoin economy, we are still counting it in USD which heavily fluctuates to Bitcoin.
Also I'm sure fat cats are selling coins now to divest (Draper, Second market and everyone else).
So I'm waiting for sidechains backed by governments or some counterparty/bitshares product covered by heavy companies. Then there will be something backed by reality (like for example if some Saudi businessman starts selling oil for fast sidechain currency for oil trading only and selling his company's shares using counterparty, that'll blow bitcoin price really high).
However that will bring bitcoin to heavily regulated international currency meaning only the hodlers and early investors will have any win in this case (which is doubtful, sidechains might use pennies for billions of transfers but they can NOT demand any more coins, meaning bitcoin can be essentially a pennystock).

The biggest limit to the price is confirmation time.

It's the biggest issue. Yes it's cosmetic, but it what's people notice!
Always remember that you had smartphones before iPhone.
We need immediate confirmations. Like you pressed the button and 30 seconds later it's confirmed, not 10-40 minutes later. When you pay with paypal it's immediate. With Bitcoin it takes a lot of time due to all merchants and systems waiting for confirmation.

"Should be" but won't be.
You want to change minds of millions. People don't care the difference. They want it here and now. I tell it as a businessman, not some random guy from outside.
Nobody cares about "intrinsic value", "faster than bank transaction confirmation". In fact nobody uses banks to buy coffee, they use either cash, or card - both confirmations are IMMEDIATE. The funds are not locked of course, but cash may also be fraudulent unless you put it in the bank or dump somewhere successfully.
But see, NOBODY CARES.

I should come over and either just hand in a 2-key combination (one is private key with funds other is the return for cash) or pay directly from my phone or card with coins and don't even think about the confirmations.

Well it's like saying "hey that bike has wheels and we are a boat, we can never crash".
The code complexity still affects this issue.
I mean Bitcoin needed almost 10 years to come to minimal usability.
And while devs respond with ludicrous criticism of minor variable change they promote controversial multi-variable changes (segwit) and 3rd party extension.
I mean if they are fighting for our security, then they should not do what they propose and promote it as that code is more complex than blocksize limit expansion. If 1 variable change can affect bitcoin to complete halt, stop or decline as they claim, why multi-variable change and extension won't affect it? And if it does, why not apply little change first?

But it's not the Satoshi vision.
It's the same as you would be running a mysql database.
So here we are either deciding Satoshi vision was wrong and question the whole bitcoin ecosystem or implementing changes in the protocol proposed by him and expecting the outcome.
I'm just saying today our company setup a dedicated node with highest security level possible and 1gbps network speed on a dedicated server which they will keep for accounting and future expansion.
Should you be running a node in this case at all? Isn't it like holding a hand of a grown up man?
I'm not even a big blocker but currently I see that transactions get delayed constantly within the business (I get the bitpay messages).
In IT we have a rule 80/20. 80% utilization 20% free means expansion. No matter the costs. Some extend it to 90/10.

Seriously you are arguing now with Satoshi Nakomoto (with his whitepaper and forum accounts), not me.
I can run the node up until the blocks are 10GB in size. Then it will be a hassle for my 1gbps home connection (for €20 per month).
Anyone in my country can run it without issues up until 1GB in block size (so to ~5000 transactions per second)
So I don't even know what you are talking about. Block size is not a problem at all currently. Especially with purging capabilities.
And it is stupid to rely on enthusiasts in a multibillion system. If you want the price to stagnate or fall, sure keep it at 1MB. LN won't be used by people who actually agreed with Genesis block, remember that one? Yeah... Because LN is nothing else than centralization layer

Those who actually need to move money out of exorbitant banking and capital controls.
Those that want to keep their wallet safe from thieves and burglars.
Those who hodl? They still keep their money in. Want to run a node and you have dialup? Use a VPS then. Bitcoin was not meant for BBS and dialup, sorry. First blocks were unlimited and the only limit back then was network capabilities, now we can see that those are fixed we can actually go for large blocks and unlimited in the future.

The issue is after certain size of blocks there is no incentive to keep the nodes running apart **exceptional altruism** or **profit**. 
How many nodes would people invested in limited currency due to not liking inflationary currency would run the nodes for free?
Now ask yourself who would profit of this? Miners. And here we have the consensus lost.

A 100mb block would already be enough for such shift.

A 100 mb every 10 minutes will cap 1mbit/s channel for 14 minutes.
A 1 mbit/s channel will be saturated so no 1mbit/s nodes.
10 mbit/s node will deliver it fully saturated within 1.4 minutes.
100 mbit/s will deliver it within 8.4 seconds which will saturate incoming connection for this period. If you are peering egress that will mean you will get your channel saturated at least few times more to send the block to other peers. Now unless you have a dedicated 100mbit/s up/down duplex this will be a little nuisance.
How many people have 100 mbps up and down nowadays?
I tell you, fuck little

It's difficult to disconnect that Bitcoin now is run by OTHER PEOPLE.
In my mind it's still Gavin. I found out he gave the master key away only recently.
Dumbest move ever.
But still rewriting all the code and moving away is still a pain and hit to all the things you said and told before, all your propaganda machine and for what?
All the time you said "it's just a temporary limit, devs said they will lift it if we even touch it once (and then some bloke even helpfully links to bitcointalk.org posts where top bitcoin devs and Satoshi say that it's just so nobody floods the network while average is low)" then we touched it once, twice, licked it, bumped into it, now we definitely push it with our spine and what do we get? 
Another thing you've been saying all the time is what you've been told by bitcoin devs all the time "no new feature will be implemented without prior rigorous testing, probably in another altcoin. want your feature in bitcoin? try it somewhere else" now bitcoin devs decide that it's ok to install controversial protocol patches into bitcoin on a whim. They are not discussed, not tested in Altcoins (and frankly no altcoin dev would ever in sane mind put RBF into it). Users are just fait accompli how blockstream developers applied this and that and how it will improve lightning network. How it will be beneficial for hubs. How miners will profit. Seg-wit anyone?
I admit I was a shadow zealot. I admit I used my business to promote bitcoin and to bitcoin to promote my business. I admit I cried a lone tear a bit today when the client told me "sent payment via paypal, Bitcoin is not working right, I don't know why".
Because I know why and there is nothing I can do about it because as it is it depends on money and I'm not that rich.
Bitcoin is truly dead. Eaten from the inside just like we were afraid in the beginning.
I fought Foundation on the network as much as I could. I even started procedures opening another foundation and paid lawyer out of pocket money to investigate all the caveats of setting up such foundation in EU.
But I lost. I lost to people with more money. I admit defeat. I sold Bitcoin because it is no longer better than Ripple or Paypal and serves the same purpose and plays the same role.
I know no one will see this post except you. So I hope you now understand how Coinbase zealots might feel about leaving bitcoin.
I still accept bitcoin in my business. But it's business only. I could accept Ripple if it would have larger following.
So long and thanks for the ride.

On the other hand it's good because with bitcoin being literally nothing (and i have official letters from central bank and irs which states exactly that, they are not even a taxable item) you can pay zero tax from it.

You can never be sure. In business as well. Bogus accounts, fake clients, skanky competitors. Anything might happen.
Within real world you take certain risks and liability for such actions. Bitcoin is in the real world now and what we see now is power vacuum in the dev zone because, unfortunately, Gavin was spineless to enforce change early enough. Now he collaborates with a sketchy but powergrabby Hearn who corrupts the whole idea with his censoring additions.
As an early adopter I'm really disappointed in Bitcoin core devs. All promises broken, instead we are fighting over whether we need to expand or not. Most funny part is this expansion does not hinder Bitcoin itself somehow. It only affects company's who would like to keep it for themselves.

Due to nature of Bitcoin if you are using bitcoin only, technically and legally you don't need to pay taxes.
Bitcoin is numbers. And you don't pay particular piece of money or credit notes. You ask a ledger maker to sign that certain amount of numbers moved from number to another number. Because there is no legal backup of these amounts except for the ledger maker (winning miner) signing it with a number and network accepting it, technically it cannot be taxed. Also you cannot be taxed by the random numbers posted on the internet, otherwise you can post your own numbers somewhere of low rate and pay nil taxes.
There is zero 0 null nil official involvement in Bitcoin right now (except for maybe few countries including USA) and all are afraid to touch it (except for USA because they CAN dare their public) because accepting it and allowing it will make it expand crazily, forbidding it will make it expand even faster.
Now there are exit points - exchanges - those are trouble and legally will report you...

"Here comes Quanty!!!" But seriously quantum computers would put Bitcoin to its knees.
Bitcoin community proved it cannot consent on something written in whitepaper and by original developer as a master plan. So changing something like algorithm of key derivation would be impossible. It would probably fall to 0 overnight and devs would switch to other currencies which are quantum-computer-proof the next day.

This is not an overvaluation bubble.
Currently we are in PROHIBITION STAGE.
There is no such thing in that graph because it's an overvaluation bubble example (which happened twice already from 750 to 600 and 1200 to 900).
Now the market which was responsible for this is closing, that means we will go to a bit deeper the mean and back to mean (which I put at 300 now, my previous estimation was 450-600).

Get your ass to wikipedia and read about difference between hashes and encryption.
Even if it is compromised, the algorithm can be replaced with either Keccak (which is allegedly crypto strong against quantum computers) or sha512 (which is easier a bit).

It's not frustrating, as I said before, Bitcoin will see a lot of bubbles, until you can go out and buy pizza with it from hand to hand. Then the "convert to fiat" need will start to fall. After this SMB's will start trading between them with BTC, then medium businesses will start accepting it, and finally - corporations. And here comes the fun part, when all are paying in BTC each other, governments will follow.
Now there are a lot of problems to overcome, first to replace CASH we need faster transaction passing, this will hopefully be fixed by upcoming protocol additions for payments (because it sux to wait 10 minutes for confirmation).

It's not Bitcoin problem, actually. The protocol is fine, the currency is there also...
Just wait till Chinese sell all, they'll be selling off all day (it's just like April). Now's the lunchtime coming, when they see how the price fell, they either sell more or buy more.
Bitstamp will probably go lower than the Chinese low, so it will be around $400 in China and $328 in Bitstamp.
Then it will rise to $500 China, $450 Bitstamp...

Inflationary system "works" for world where the population is on the rise. And it works only for capitalists who receive the money and give it back to banks (see economy here is a loop). Why the 2008 crisis? Well the demand for houses dropped but the money was still printed (and the gov did not know about it, because everything is covered by layers of credit). The same happened in PC economy now, the demand dropped because everyone is satisfied with what they have, but keynesians rely on a dogma of CONSTANT demand which is not true.
TL;DR: The whole keynesian bullshit is to level the wealth among the commoners and keep the big value for the rich, but it "works" only if there is constant demand, otherwise it brings only suffering and inflation.

it's not about coins at all.
It's about blockchain messaging and confirmations.
So all of the trustees must report a of their various fiat accounts to the blockchain.
So when you click withdraw in your system (you choose a trustee and way and fees) one of the trustees must send a confirmation that it is going to do so and it will be confirmed by miners.
After all of this the payment will arrive within the time frame.
In case of problems you can go to real life court and return the money.
Moreover escrows can be used with the trustees for the additional protection, but for a fee.

1) Bubble means it will pop and never return to this high again, to everyone THIS IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF THERE IS A FATAL FLAW IN ALL OF THE CRYPTO-CURRENCIES PROTOCOLS AND BANKING SOFTWARE PROTECTIONS, OR IF BITCOIN REACHES HIGHER THAN THE WORLDS WEALTH CAPITALIZATION.
Sorry for the CAPS but I think this is important to notice.
2) There is a big problem day-trading. For example a sale of 100 BTC will move the market 10 dollars east, but currently the buying pressure is so strong that it will immediately return to +10 dollars. It would be cool if the markets would be fast, but all of them are reaaaaalllyy slow (well except MtGox now, but I think it is mainly because of the lost users which includes me as well) so you won't even have time to buy in at -10.
3) They are here to stay, like different currencies in the world, but BTC is the GOLD of crypto-currencies, the comparison with gold is not exact because there can only be 21.5 millions of bitcoins, ONLY, not to mention the lost wallets.
4) Bitcoin is not a company. It's like he said, Well HTTP rode high, but a year later the entire tech market busted and HTTP traffic slowed down, but look where we are now?
It's protocol, and it has it's use, when last problems are fixed (transaction approval speed, blockchain size) cool features are added ( smart automation (escrow, contracts, companies etc)) it will cost millions if not more.

That's the point.

@_date: 2013-05-03 18:11:34
You can make bitcoin with quantum cryptography (dibs on Qtc ). This will render miners and pools obsolete, making transaction almost instant, as with quantum crypto you won't need proof of work, as it will be irreversible.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:35:41
You can use Bitcoin-QT for that without problems.
But usually it's either bitpay or bips with their QR codes
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:40:23
I've payed 0 fees on almost all of my transactions.
Nowadays they move fast.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:56:13
Sure, but we just passed a hard-fork and blockchain does not need to be changed, you can just change the version and clients will get that the version of block is changed, according to specs if they don't know what to do they should drop that.
The only problem will be with miners. I don't know why Satoshi chose 256 over 512 (which should be stronger, maybe the length in the protocol?) but choosing Keccak would be unacceptable as it is not crack-proof enough yet (it just passed the crypto-tests).
In fact I'm sure it is possible to supply different block verifications for different type of transactions. But to be fair, I think the whole proof-of-work 10 minutes limit as a global lock is flawed. We have to replace that with global commit/rollback transaction based locking, which will allow near instant transfers.
In my opinion, while Satoshi was a good cryptographer, he was a bad network protocol designer. That's why he invented proof-of-work and mining, he solved a network problem with cryptography (he does that a lot in the blockchain codes as well, too many "safe" variables which you can drop entirely, like protocol version, sizes of variables, block size and nonces etc).

When there are quantum computers, bitcoin protocol can be redone allowing instant confirmations without proof-of-work.
Proof-of-work is needed now, quantum encryption would solve this problem at instant.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:21:50
It's entirely possible to just accept 0 confirmations for small transactions (up to $200).
For everything else you could just apply ID monitoring, just like it is done now with cards.
The doublespends are really not that easy for simple people, and for hackers the current cards &amp; cash are MUCH easier to doublespend.

Well the whole proof of work system works only with a blockchain..
There are ways to make faster confirmations (for example using my fair transactions proposition which is very sound).
There are ways to lesser the blockchain (currently it's an analog of RAID-1 over all of the net, we can make it raid-6 which is more robust and while giving much more space, also local block chain compression may be applied for non relevant information).

Once it realises it's full potential it will reach it's market cap.
And then the early adopters who held will be rewarded, early adopters who transacted will be rewarded as well, and those who went after will be rewarded with security of low volatility.
Unlike gold the total amount is known, so no accidental inflation by Jimmy finding a gold vein in his garden.
Unlike gold it can be used as medium without additional checks of legitimacy.
There never was such a currency in the world, it's the first time and it's fucking awesome.
I'm hoarding because I can't pay with it most of my bills and receive most of my payments with Paypal which takes 14% off every damn time. So I will be the rewarded adopter for hoarding and keeping the value. I still would hoard given the opportunity to pay and would pay with what I earn, not what I accumulated for various needs (like kids college for example). And yeah, I hoard in USD and Euros and it sucks because they've reached their caps but instead of accumulating you pay taxes and inflation.
When you hoard - money is your time, your health that you lost accumulating the wealth. And just imagine government sucking it off you every second your money is in the bank on deposit with highest rate in the country (3.9%) during rebate period.

First I lost, next time I won. And if you don't day trade for a long time - you are going to lose skills, more like skills of self-control.
One thing I should tell, never buy mid or high then sell low to buy in in the low point - you won't do it and you will lose the difference in the end. If you miscalculated and bought high - just hold.
AND another thing, don't trade all - trade parts - divide by two (so you have money and coins all the time) and look at your overall performance. This is the biggest mistake I've done this bubble because of sleep deprivation and lost almost all short-term profit. You never go all-in except super long-term.
And don't regret with "I said so" and argue with your spouse or whoever. Practice shows - no emotions is best, so don't do that, in the end it's gambling.
AND you can get more for your coins on another exchange (like kraken or localbitcoins). With your amount it will be fast-verifiable to profit.
TL; DR: it's difficult.

There are dumb-money, people who got 1000 for $0.1, they will sell any time they can, but everyday these people supply is thinning. Now 1000 sell won't do a lot of damage, but 10K sell out will do, though there's no reality to finding such and the price will bounce back fast because of SMART-MONEY, which are in now.
I'm fairly sure we are in smart-money in phase.
There might be stagnation or small downfall, but not crazy 1-minute-all-gone in the future (unless someone finds 10000BTC and sells them with instasell on one of the exchanges).
Still the buy-in pressure is really high, unlike April, and the volumes are modest now, because not many hold a lot. And smart-money won't instasell.

It can be implemented, the thing is there is no sound inflationary algorithm available, because no inflationary system proved itself throughout the history, contrary to the deflationary.

1. It's not an issue now, the blockchain can be optimized (currently it's just a concatenation of received blocks without even compression).
You can use SPV nodes for your needs
2. There will be a lot of bubbles. See long-term Bitcoin is very huge and nobody can estimate how huge it will be (even knowing the protocol I cannot grasp the possibilities opening, it might bring us to capitalistic utopia). Short-term people come and don't understand the technical information and the abilities of the protocol and the security included, they just look at the price. It's good you wanted to know more, but there are many people who just bought Bitcoin for fun and will jump the ship if they lose half of their possession in fiat value.
3. Currently there are small incentives to buy in, for example getting a discount (because as a seller I don't have to account for fraud or fees). As the economy grows (and that can happen ONLY if Bitcoin is legalized, because the private hand-to-hand market is already used to the max) you will see more incentives to pay in Bitcoin, it will be faster, easier, cheaper way to pay as well as setup contracts or negotiate.
4. You can create brain wallet, not as secure as randomly generated strings, but still you will be able to recreate.
Or just get used to make a backup of your wallet.dat after adding addresses
5. Pseudonymous - it's a huge difference. They can be refundable - protocol includes the ability to "code" any type of transaction verification (so you can even add a passphrase to the payment) so including a 3rd, 4th, nth party in multisignature transactions is not a problem, clients currently do not support this, but this can be done and will be done soon or later.
Hope I answered your questions. Have a good day.

So here's the thing, we can still use mtgox and other bank account trustees with a name and public offers/contracts BUT the trade (interface) and virtual money are traded on a p2p network.

The problem is, they are comparing Bitcoin to gold, which is not true at all.
I repeat all the time, there was never such a currency as Bitcoin in the world. It's finite, limited supply. Saying there is Litecoin or other copycats is like saying WELL there are USD and Russian Roubles, which one would you use?
Exactly. They are both finite supplies and you can diversify, though LTC is less valuable because of less userbase.
That's the difference.
There are no experts in Bitcoin economy. Period.
There might be experts in horde psychology, experts in markets, experts in trading. But most of them try to apply general on to specialty. It's like wine and chicken meat experts try to predict the taste of duck with cider sauce saying "Well it's poultry/rotten juice, it's basically the same".

Your "unlikely" is based on assumption that there is no elephant in the room :), or if even somebody sees him, he will hide him back.
One thing is certain if SHA256 is hacked that means a whole plateau of cryptographic hashes are broken (SHA-2 exactly) which includes SHA512 as well. This may take some cryptographic encryption down with it (I'm not sure though) because the methods may apply authentically. And Keccak was not even ready when Satoshi brought up the bitcoin net

There will be downvotes because of the money involved.
You know when big business goes in, there might be no bad news about Bitcoin at all anymore because people can be bought and killed for such info.
The thing is, Bitcoin is so complex to discuss with Tax offices and Financial institutions that they can't even understand and wrap their heads around how it works and all.
Many say killer app for Bitcoin will be one thing or another NO, Bitcoin is not your smartphone or something, it will have plenty of killer apps (if you've seen the protocol you will understand that it is crazy of what is possible with it), but the first one to be is Colored Coins, Escrow, Contracts and Smart-Property, to safely exchange the XBT for THINGS and CURRENCIES without middle-men (see Mt. Gox, BTC-E, Bitstamp and BTCChina). That's why it's a huge problem of involvement of Bitcoin foundation in the developing process (and why they started doing this shitty payment support which is not what's needed now, because the things I've listed will do it right away).

Inflation does not help any wealth spreading, it just moved the real value away from gold to actual production - business.
BUT it did not work, as the government is corrupt, and now we have selectivism in economics (bailouts), rising gap between middle-men (banks and government) and commoners (workers and company's). Bitcoin moves the middle-men away and as soon as it stabilizes maybe in 10-20 years the market WILL start to trade, because Bitcoin will inflate if nobody buys anything and will deflate if people sell it.
When you see it NOT RISING ANYMORE because we hit the cap, you either hold it as a perspective of buying something, or use it to trade, same as with current money, just without artificial inflation.
