Most likely I think, you have to create a file with what you want to etch/cut and even though it’s done on an administrator/teacher computer it’s probably connected to the school network

Yep, thinking about it more definitely makes it seem like a bad idea, thank you

Yh I always just try to remember that in a years time these dips won’t matter, I think of them as a better opportunity to buy more coin

I'm pretty sure everything is going correctly as it goes through but I instantly receive an email saying it's been cancelled, also I just realised coinbase says Bitcoin is unavailable right now

That's what it says, do you know of a fix?

Thanks man, I’m a teenager with little responsibilities and I’m just investing some wages so I’m not really worried
