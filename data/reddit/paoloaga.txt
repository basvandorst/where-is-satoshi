In a perfect world populated by honest people, the winner would turn the bitcoins back to Bitfinex and it's users.
Unfortunately it's very probable that the winner is the thief himself.

The altcoin is the branch who gets less PoW.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:23:21
This comes out directly from your ass.
@_date: 2016-08-23 11:05:22
It works like this for everyone.
But if everyone buys the price goes up, therefore there is something smelly under it, must be a scam. ( :-D )
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:22:34
With blocksize stagnation, you will end up paying same fees or more as bitcoin gets adopted (if it gets adopted). Low TX fees make your transactions spam. Core devs promised 100x TX fees increase to miners.
@_date: 2016-08-15 15:59:59
At 3 tps, it will happen nothing.
@_date: 2016-08-17 10:42:10
@_date: 2016-08-25 10:30:51
Therefore we are ready to increase the blocksize.

Just join BCH! Low fees, quick transactions, problem solved.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:07:58
Your nickname says it all. FUD. Prove me that BCH is centralized. They have more independent development teams than BTC and a collaborative community. They are actively improving everything, it feels like bitcoin between 2011 and 2013. It is not centralized and it is not in the hands of few people.
It is like if I say that Bitcoin is controlled by Theymos (who has more influence on BTC than anybody else on BCH).

Who pays for the fees when forcing bitcoins out?
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:08:46


If your node don't accept mined blocks with the new ruleset, even if they include your transactions you will never see those as confirmed, unless you upgrade to their ruleset.


Because if nodes keep rejecting mined blocks, they can't make new transactions (or they can only "try" to send bitcoins, not receive) and soon there will be no more transactions to mine.


I don't see Dogecoin as a good store of value, and I would not hold any. Ethereum is gaining value thanks hype, I don't see any logic for it to be better of bitcoin, on this point of view.
Increasing the unit supply is not the way for miners to become rich. It would be not much more interesting than fiat money.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:15:52




Not necessarily. It would be very hard only if you have a very slow internet connection and you have a very slow computer with small storage. Modern home computers with "netflix" capable connections can handle several MB blocks.


A node doesn't cast any vote. Miners cast votes. You need a full node only if you want to verify the information written in the blockchain without the need of trusting other services.
Segwit itself it is NOT a scaling solution.
Let anything have a chance, big blocks, segwit (as an hard fork, without the anyone-can-spend workaround) and when other services will be ready (2nd layer platforms) let them compete on the free market to offload the chain.
@_date: 2017-02-01 09:58:49
Plain FUD unless you can prove it.
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:33:56


Yes, you are right... I was focused on the second part of the message and I didn't notice my mistake.
If nodes rejects them but miners keep mining the new ruleset, either you upgrade your nodes or you can't get any transactions through. Unless both of the chains survive with all the troubles related. This is one reason why changing the reward would not happen.
They don't win because wealth can't be created out of thin air. If scarcity is no more, people looking for a store of value would travel to other lands (a more suitable crypto, or gold, or whatever).
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:40:19
The node may signal anything but *it has no value*. It would be quite cheap to install thousands of virtual machines signalling something that real users might not be interested in.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:55:38
Running a full node gives you only two things: 1) a copy of the block chain. 2) confidence that the data in your own copy of the block chain stick to the rules.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:28:20
Bitcoin's testnet has a longer chain but not the greatest POW. Branch selection considers the quantity of POW not the lenght of the chain. A branch with 2 blocks at difficulty 1000 weights more than a branch with 10 blocks with difficulty 10.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:22:24
BU does not violate the Satoshi Whitepaper, it is perfectly compatible. It's even more closer to it than Core.
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:32:08
The same is for users. They can't stick to minority rules if majority is doing something else.
This is why in case of a BU HF with 75% majority the risk of splitting the coin is really low, toward 0.
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:23:58

Gasoline cars are already obsolete. Figure it out by 2020.
@_date: 2017-02-02 01:03:03
Segfault alone doesn't double anything, it needs the compliance of every software that builds transactions. It will take a lot of time before we can see that real throughput. With BU it's instant, without changing anything else.
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:39:26
Better to spread and not unite, otherwise it would be like if it was centralized.

With bigger blocks it would be fast without spending high tx fees.

Yes, the one you talked about where miners increase the monetary supply.


No, miners will stop mining things for which people don't want. There is no incentive in extending the monetary supply.


But miners won't profit more, otherwise it would already be like this.
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:23:16
If all the miners agrees on this, yes, it is very possible.
It would just be stupid because they would destroy the value of bitcoin, and obtaining more units with very low value is worse than obtaining less units highly priced.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:52:05
BU wants free market fees and free market block sizes.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:50:59
TX fees should be 60 cents or more to be confirmed quickly. OP, show the TXid so we can check that you are saying the truth.

TX fee is 40 cents, not 4.
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:35:31
You keep writing your own opinion without explaining any reason.
BU = less fees, bigger adoption, bigger price, bigger reward for miners (both from fees and generated coins).
@_date: 2016-03-10 16:43:07
You should not consider only the absolute value of fees. It's right that fees will increase, but usage/adoption shrinks and the total fees perceived by miners are lower. Miner earnings follow a "Laffer curve", if fees are too high (or TXs take too long to confirm, if ever), miner revenue will be lower. And the data presented by Organofcorti show exactly this behavior. 1 MB blocks are a trouble.
@_date: 2016-03-08 17:47:54
Change POW and your new altcoin will not be anymore safe. The other fork which uses "Poof. Gone." hardware is the most safe crypto of the world, and therefore inherits all the value. Trace doesn't know what he is talking about.

@_date: 2017-03-01 13:33:11
Oh, I was referring to a full node without any hashing power attached. I thought it was clear.
Multisigs and timelocks can be done with any tool, you don't need a full node to do that.

The full node of the miner defines it. If &gt;50% of miners use a different version of the full node, that becomes the "official" full node.
@_date: 2017-03-01 02:35:42
Full nodes without hashing power attached don't define anything.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:29:24
If you don't change the POW, you are putting your smallest chain at risk because since there is an huge amount of hardware being able to mine SHA256, one single large miner could 51% attack it easily. His incentive is to give more value to the long chain where he has stakes in.
@_date: 2016-03-11 23:10:21
1) Chinese farms will buy lots of computers and centralize the mining again.
2) CPU mining would pressure hackers into running mining software on their botnets. ASICs are what make botnets useless.

Show me the paper.
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:26:09


If it gets &gt;51% of hashing power, then it's how the blockchain should evolve, as it is defined in the whitepaper.


This is just your opinion, backed by nothing.


The altcoin is the branch with less POW, but only if it doesn't die off.


I did a lot of reasoning using intelligence. You just pulled words out of your ass.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:44:56
Because Ethereum doesn't share the same genesis block.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:29:26
Ok this is fair enough. Anyway programmers alone would not have gone so far without the support of everyone!
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:09:51
Totally false statement. Why is it useless? It validates blocks exactly like core. It is not a scam, it just works.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:31:34
The chain with most POW has the right to call itself Bitcoin, as defined in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-03-10 15:03:09
Graphs show that the bigger are, the higher is the % of TXfee compared to the new coins subsidy. It's clear that with bigger ( &gt;1M ) blocks, miners will earn more, without upsetting users with higher fees.
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:49:04
You don't represent the whole community. Just because your experience was good, doesn't mean it feels the same for everyone.
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:48:49
It's pretty easy to use one real node with lots of "smart proxies" that appear as thousands nodes. The only requirement is having many IP address available. Not very difficult, I have several thousands available.
@_date: 2017-03-01 02:35:10


Less fees for users. More tx for block = same or more fees for miners.


Many businesses stop accepting bitcoins because of too slow or expensive transactions. Many users get scared because of tx delays and go away.


Can't be proven without try. But logic makes me think that more users = more value.


From the larger number of TX confirmed and for the increased BTC value.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:49:29
Bullshit. The satoshi whitepaper doesn't state it this way.
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:28:00
I won't assume "now" as safe for the network, it's quite complex and a lot of software beside nodes need to be updated to properly handle it.

@_date: 2017-03-04 04:17:25
You want a fee market with increased fees to support miners. You want small blocks and a small blockchain to carry over. Jihan Wu is doing exactly what you small blockers want: small blocks, and now you are blaming him? Where is the logic? Isn't he doing a favor to you?
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:33:53
BTU does not exist. When the hard fork will happen, the chain with most PoW is BTC, no matter the size of the block.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:35:46
Fees are not proportional to the length of the queue. If blocks are not full, fees get lower. If blocks are full, you need to overcome others' fees to get yours included quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:49:57

But they should change POW and therefore define theirselves ad an altcoin.


Your personal and not trustworthy opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:28:33
It's partially true. It would work only if every wallet and transaction generator gets updated. SW is a fix for malleability and not a scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:00:25
Unlimited size blocks does not mean that blocks keep raising their size. There is a point that when crossed makes too risky for orphaning for the miners.
So Miners will not make a block too big compared to the available technological resources of that period in time.
Bigger blocks == centralization is an old lie that has already been debunked several times.
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:49:59
51% attack is when one single miner has 50+% of the hashing power.
The situation with &gt;50% of miners with a different version is called Hard Fork and it is perfectly fine.

@_date: 2017-03-06 21:41:33
Core Developers follow their ideas in a religious way and not from a pure rational point of view. For example take the 1 MB block stall, which is causing LOTS of troubles and kills user experience. 1 MB blocks are not enough even when there will be the LN (for opening and closing channels).
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:00:00
and the 500+ lines of code needed to implement segwit instead of changing a constant is being paranoid about security?

You never heard mentioned it here because posts get moderated/deleted. Go to to learn about Classic.
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:59:21
You are wrong. If a centrally-located miner produces a giant block, slow to propagate, there are more chances that it will get orphaned. The block size will grow up to an optimal size that is a compromise between propagation times and fee earning.
It's in the interest of miners to have a good internet connection, like they do when they buy good hardware or the power connection (which is far more expensive).
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:19:56
You need a lot of courage to think that someone is "spamming" spending lots of money in tx fees... The world is big and you only need a small tiny fraction of people using bitcoin to overwhelm 1 MB blocks with legit transactions.
Mempool will be free when people are too uncomfortable with high fees and turn to another payment system.
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:25:55
There is no serious argument to not increase the block size.  Even without any limit, pools are still able to mine a block of the size they like more, even empty. 1 GB block doesn't mean that all blocks will be 1 GB, and doesn't mean that every pool will include every tx.
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:07:38
Including 0 fee TX make blocks bigger and increase probability to be orphaned. Miners will not include TX with too-low fees, even if blocksize is unlimited. Turn your brain on before saying others can't think far.
@_date: 2017-01-26 10:30:59
You don't know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:43:39
Not until LN will be ready. TX fees are going to rise, and the block size doesn't.

But you can follow some logic. I am talking with lots of people, and everyone has a bad user experience because of expensive transaction and/or troubles with confirmations.

If I know several people quitting bitcoin, I can imagine that there are many more in the whole world. An huge number.

If there can be max N txs/day, no matter how much you increase the fees, there's no way to fit more. You can just push away users who send smaller amounts for which the fees make it not convenable anymore.

1) Segwit as a soft fork is on-chain mess that gives incentives to miners to collude and steal "pay to anyone" SW transactions.

Supposing the generation of new bitcoins is near zero, miners can compete on fees: they can set a minimum fee. Competing miners can set lower minimum fees if their operation is more efficient. The result is that fees will tend to be as expensive as needed, not more, not less. Market will self-balance.

@_date: 2016-11-14 01:58:29
Actually to attack the network is much easier. With 1 MB blocks and 3 tps you just need to pay a small fraction of that cost in fees of many tx to self, and render bitcoin too expensive (so useless) for most of the users.

We love you too. /s

My power to leave will affect you.

$22 billion industry at 3 TPS? LOL?
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:57:36
Such features are welcome, but not available yet. We have the capacity problem NOW.
If those ways are better than on-chain TXs, most transactions will happen there, even with no blocksize limits, simply because it's cheaper. No reason to be stubborn and cripple the network at a magic number of 1 MB per block.
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:24:32
Actually off chain transactions don't really exist. Let's imagine we jump a few years in the future. If both off-chain and on-chain TX are possible, for each transaction users can choose if they want to use off-chain tx (small amounts) or on-chain tx (large amounts). The threshold where an amount can be considered large or small will be set by market forces.
Miners will get paid for their work. If there are few on-chain TX, because off-chain txs are cheap and reliable, the fee will be relatively high and users are even more pushed transactiong off chain. Otherwise if off-chain TX aren't comfortable for any reason, users will transact on-chain and fees will be relatively low.
How high or low will be decided by market forces. Miners will compete to provide the better price/performance to maximize their earnings, balancing through quantity of transactions and fees collected.
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:53:24
Yes, anyway the whitepaper didn't define a blocksize limit, and it has introduced as a temporary limit to be removed.
High TX fees make bitcoin unsuitable for several use cases.
Now it's just a matter of stubborn people but when miners realize their losses due to lack of growth, the day after all of them will signal support to bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-12-07 03:12:37
Karma exists! \o/
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:12:28
Of course, if other variables could grow proportionally to the bitcoin diffusion it would be a deal. Unfortunately this is not the case. With adoption, keeping the blocksize limit to 1 M leads to exclusion of the vast majority of bitcoin users who doesn't have huge savings and transact with little amounts because high transaction fees makes bitcoin not convenable anymore. We already hit this limit hard, and things can only get worse.
Disclaimer: I am not against 2nd layer scaling like LN. LN is more than welcome, and should compete freely against on-chain TXs.
The max blocksize should not be hard-limited to magic number (1 M) because of two reasons:
- it would not be fair competition vs LN
- market forces will automatically allow to discover what is the right size (it changes during time due to technology improvements).

@_date: 2016-02-29 19:27:33
Yes, core devs are testing how much stress we can stand, due to a crippled bitcoin network.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:24:56
Maybe it will be the future, but we are experiencing the issue NOW, and it needs to be fixed immediately, failing to do so would mean that another crypto will replace it.
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:00:44
Nobody is forced to mine. Every miner knows about the halvings. Mining is "opportunistic", everyone is free to do it when/how/if it is convenable for him/her. Don't put artificial limits or constraints, let it self-regulate as it always did, and as it was designed. Block size limit is a cancer for the bitcoin environment.
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:32:58
Bitcoin decentralization is destroyed making it a settlement-only network where only big players will be interested to keep nodes alive. You are showing your lack of understanding of the whole thing.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:46:46
They are studying but there is not any working solution yet. And meanwhile the network is not capable to handle the needed volume of TX, resulting in an expensive slow service, not suitable for underbanked environment.
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:10:13
On the article I read:
Jesse Powell: Without picking a specific proposal, let me say what I'd like to see:
- Incentives for nodes
- Less centralization in mining
- Bitcoin as a currency prioritized above other uses of the Bitcoin/blockchain
Read the third point: Bitcoin as a currency prioritized above other uses. It doesn't mean Bitcoin as a settlement network.
Welcome, huge blocks!
@_date: 2016-09-01 10:47:54
The blocksize hard fork.
@_date: 2016-09-04 06:44:34
Exactly :-)
@_date: 2016-09-03 21:03:03
@_date: 2016-10-20 16:33:14
You can't do it unless there will be a working way to make massive transaction quantities.
@_date: 2016-10-27 08:00:12
Now there is not visa-like transactions. Off chain scaling is useful and needed but let's expand blocks until it will be available.
@_date: 2016-10-04 19:19:59
It happens in china too: 
@_date: 2016-10-21 22:23:32
So why don't we extend the blocksize while L2 solutions are production ready?
@_date: 2016-10-16 22:56:10
This is not bitcoin. Bitcoin is made of hundreds thousand TXs with smaller amounts for every transaction like the one you highlight.
@_date: 2016-10-21 22:21:43
Mining is not the only way to earn bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-10-31 09:38:44
The one which will change the POW  is the altcoin.

Governments can't take a cut of your money but miners do!
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:39:00
A clean hard fork that removes the current block size artificial limit.
@_date: 2016-10-22 02:31:09
Well, to remove the block size limit is not extremely hard and the code is already there. It seems that even with LN and all those technologies, blocks need to be larger. Sticking to small blocks is just political.
@_date: 2016-10-27 01:48:02
False, unless you can explain how. It would require larger expenses to sustain a spam-attack with the same fees and larger blocks.
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:51:30
Bigger blocks make this kind of attack less effective.
@_date: 2016-10-14 15:02:06
Of course, I also think it's not possible to store EVERY tx on the blockchain, nevertheless 1 MB is not enough even for LN+SW+[add your favorite acronym here].
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:41:42
With 1 MB blocks, each person can make an average of 1 transaction every 79 years.
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:17:27
Other off-chain layers for transactions are welcome, of course. And they will happen long before reaching the need of constant 3500 TPS.
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:55:36
Holy words!
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:59:50
As usual people stop posting when discussion comes to the point.
@_date: 2016-10-27 08:01:51
Indeed, blockstream through core created the problem for which LN is the only solution! :-)
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:43:48
Waiting some seconds would no have allowed them to publish the block because linking the transactions would invalidate that block.
Antpool mining an empty block doesn't affect the queue of stuck transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:58:05
Replay protection might be useful for the smaller bonsai branch that will result if people are stubborn enough to not let it die. A quick fix for quadratic hashing is to limit the maximum size of a tx (1 MB would be large enough). The new blocksize should not be a fixed number, but something dynamic that may change depending on needs, bandwidth costs, cpu power and so on.
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:29:25
Increasing the transaction fee means applying more power to the elbows and throw out other transactions. If there is no space for everyone, more and more people just find bitcoin to be too expensive and switch to other payment methods.
@_date: 2016-10-27 18:08:31
If I need to move/use my money I have to give a cut to miners. This "cut" is getting bigger and bigger.
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:19:17
Even if the block size limit is increased to 143 GB, blocks will not be 143 GB big, unless there have been 1,000,000 TPS recently. Therefore why consider it a bad idea?
A limit could be optionally set, but it should exist only to prevent cheap attacks (lots of useless transactions to fill up space) and increased along with the bitcoin adoption. 1 MB today is too small.
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:39:40
And after LN+SW+whatever, would the concerns disappear? In what block size increase now is different to block size increase later?
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:54:14
Network upgrade to bloat the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:53:10
There is not any code required to change a constant in the source code.
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:46:36
Yes, and as everyone raises the fees to jump ahead others, small transactions get priced out, reducing the size of the queue. This is not how it was supposed to work.
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:25:15
Why would you think I am trolling? I didn't write with the purpose of annoying other people, I just expressed my thoughts, which represent my feelings, and I don't think I am the only one.

Did you shoot those numbers directly out from your ass? sipa.btc.info does not exist, and I can't believe that there are so many wallet and services with SW enabled.
@_date: 2016-07-19 09:51:54
I don't see how can anyone be happy about high tx fees. Fees should be &gt;0 but as small as possible. High fees means excluding a large set of users, therefore reducing the value of bitcoin.
Do not mention SW and LN because they are still vaporware.
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:41:55
Therefore it will not be part of everyday life in the Caribbean.
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:02:35
With 7 expensive transactions per second, bitcoin will not become part of anything.
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:25:59
Then tell me the % of SW tx made in the last 1000 blocks.

FYI: It's way much easier to open a bitcoin account than a bank account, and almost everyone (at least in western world) has a bank account.

You keep saying he is an idiot, but the hash rate is dropping, obviously.
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:25:26
But with larger blocks miner can still earn from many small fees, making the network usable. Moreover you didn't take into account the value of bitcoin: more value = less bitcoins needed to keep mining.
@_date: 2016-07-07 01:24:35
This is why 1 MB blocks will make people really confused and why fee uncertainity will not help user experience, expecially to newbies.

If you store a backup then it becomes a paper-wallet (or whatever-wallet) but it's not anymore a brain wallet. And it's difficult and impractical to remember a long passphrase if it's generated randomly. If it is done just for fun then it might be ok.

Brainwallets are really unsafe, I would not encourage this practice.

I have friends who operate with openbazaar that are complaining about tx fees and they are worried that it might even surclass the cost of shipping.

A huge part of the community is bored with 1 MB blocks and is turning away to something else.
