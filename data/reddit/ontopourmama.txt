Who is stripe and why should I care?
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:17:24
but which crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:56:24
I'm cool with that. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:21:00
have you tried posting about it in r/kraken? I think that might be best.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:28:18
Oh no! We've created...STABILITY IN PRICE!!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:57:55
I'm not South Korean, or any kind of Korean, I don't mind it dropping so that I can get some while it is on sale!
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:41:57
Good! Because most of what I was seeing were scams anyway. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:30:54
I'm pretty sure he pulled it out of his ass. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:04:14
For once, I bought the dip! Woo hoo!.... Now that I've said that, the big crash is imminent. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:24:30
And this is why you never discuss your holdings. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:30:30
I'm fairly sure it was them that cashed out about $200mill a few weeks ago. Can't prove it, but just a hunch. They'll be fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:39:01
Kraken, as inefficient as it is, isn't a shady site. Now stop making me defend them, it makes me feel dirty. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:42:22
It seems that r/BTC is leaking again. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:05:48
We're getting more free stuff? Cool. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:30:29
That sort of depends on your point of view. If the company knows that at the moment they aren't up to standards for some people's demands, giving them another option is just a form of good customer service. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:41:27
It was kinda sorta like this 
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:44:36
Is this the same as Zap electrics, because if so, he's a scammer of the highest degree.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:52:17
Thus the tinfoil hat.
@_date: 2019-07-30 03:42:00
Found the guy that bought at $19,000!
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:47:13
*puts on tinfoil hat* How do you know Satoshi isn't just the operation name of the NSA? *takes off tinfoil hat* 
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:17:57
His stance on a universal income will be his undoing.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:26:20
Maybe track down whoever made that 997 BTC purchase yesterday......
@_date: 2019-07-31 05:35:47
So... you told them the same thing twice......
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:30:57
get to a credit union.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:05:41
I did, and it is correct. It just depends on what your priorities are.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:16:06
So.....they are copying Venmo?
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:00:44
I've heard what he has to say, and I think he's got a snowball's chance in hell of getting the nomination.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:28:57
Stupid question...do you have to pay capital gains if you have only bought, not sold?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:23:54
You make it sounds like a pyramid scam, which it certainly isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:23:59
so.... what happens if the various governments starts setting up nodes? Lots of them?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:11:55
Not Kraken, unless you just like being frustrated.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:54:16
These are the same fuckers that close their clients accounts for buying crypto. Fuck BOA.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:35:17
I sold....my BCH. No regrets and Christmas is paid for. HoHoHo!
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:10:19
So far, no. I sold my bitchcash at the beginning of the week so far, so good. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:35
I have to wonder what the tax implications of that would be. 
@_date: 2019-07-21 06:47:29
Only if you sell it, otherwise, you just have more BTC that is worth twice as much fiat as it was before.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:17:56
It could still be $5k by Christmas
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:45:41
Either one is not acceptable.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:16:03
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:32:56
It's better than most of the rollercoaster shitposts I see on here all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:03:17
I was thinking about greed selling earlier when it hit $19k, but I was so stunned at the price I just couldn't stop staring at it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:45:14
They are probably using it to pay for some of the Trump family's outrageous security needs.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:51:01
Just tell him it is payment for cocaine and hookers and he should be fine with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:25:01
did I stumble into r/memeeconomy by accident?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:20:05
at least you've got skin in the game! Welcome aboard!
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:33:10
Shots fired. Should be interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:55
you're not wrong, but it's better to give them their cut than have them come in and take it all. The government is shitty like that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:06:08
I love it!
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:47:15
There was another guy just a month or two ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:22:18
Russian oligarch? Arab oil money? Texas Oil Barron? Neckbeard that's been HODLing since 2010?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:42
Mostly reporting and tax info. Let's be real, that all the government wants. Their cut, fucking thugs.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:52:12
The NSA is also looking. Don't forget those guys, they are scarier than the other two. Sneaky little bastards.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:03:58
Seems the guys over at r/BTC are convinced that they are the original coin... Seems odd to me, since it bitcoin cash didn't even exist until August......
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:37:48
The question is if you are stroking your neckbeard in an evil way or not....
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:09:06
That he;s really gonna eat his own dick? Yes, we remember that and are counting on it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:59:02
You did the right thing. I wish bitcoin had been around for me during the years after I graduated. Debt, all debt is a chain around your neck. It makes you beholden to others. You're on a good path now. Learn to diversify your investments and grow. If you are totally debt free, you are now breathing pretty rarified air.

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:51
I really want to be excited, but this is making my Spidey Sense tingle off the charts. I do not understand why it is rising like it is. I know futures will soon be traded, but that's still a couple of weeks away, i thought. Anyone care to ELI5 what is going on?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:50:14
0010010010010101.... etc.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:21
I would like to but BCH sales are still suspended... Would have been nice to do when it hit $8K... UNLESS THAT WAS JUST SOME SORT OF GLITCH.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:22:33
Same thing, only with Kraken. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:59:16
Nothing like a sternly worded letter to get things done!

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:53:37
Cool. I shall continue to buy and HODL then.

Well, if it does, I'm buying!

Some people just love FUD, I guess.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:00:03
I don't disagree with you, but for a lot of people $50/paycheck is a hell of a lot of money. For some it is a sacrifice. Don't belittle that. These people aren't gambling, they are hoping for a better future. The very fact that it is a possibility and is open to everyone is the very thing that the powers that be fear about bitcoin and crypto in general. They don't want competition and they don't want people that have the ability to say no. That is exactly what I like about the future possibility of bitcoin, it isn't just about your portfolio.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:17:15
I am not a new comer, and I am so very, very entertained at the moment.

@_date: 2017-12-14 20:06:34
Depends on if he cashed out or not, I suppose.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:24:22
Calm down, Mr. McAfee.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:05:41
It's good thing you mentioned this. For long time bitcoiners that may not be familiar with financial practices, it's interesting to see the new people and financial insititutions continuing this practice now that they are into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:10:34
Can someone ELI5 this for me?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:49
Good to know. I thought for just a sec that I had missed something serious.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:21:22
That fee, IMO has been worth every penny when I've bought so far.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:07:52
I'm glad you said this.... who exactly do you think is at the top of this ponzi pyramid? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:41:14
Not to be nosey, but did you sell it and buy a house flat out or did you sell it and put a nice big down payment on the house? Either way, congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:05:04
Don't forget to hold back a good chunk for your taxes... they will want that. You should still have plenty after that though. Good job!
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:19:25
I'm glad you're getting what you want, but be careful about where you get your investment advice. Most of the neckbeards around here are okay, but you do have a few hostiles in the mix.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:44:13
If it does, I'm paying off my house and buying another one.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:35:08
I'll get a lot of hate for this, but it's honestly why I use coinbase. They seem to be all about compliance and are taking steps toward reporting. Yes, it sucks because the taxman cometh, but at the same time, they can't claim they are hiding illegal activities.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:34:12

I just bought some stuff off of Overstock yesterday because they do accept bitcoin... and a couple of other coins too.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:32:24

@_date: 2014-03-26 05:25:51
I lived in Japan. Yakuza are all over Tokyo and pretty much in every business you can imagine, so I can't imagine that they wouldn't want to do that in order to move money around a little easier. The guys you meet might not be the brightest ones, but like the mob over here, the are smart enough to hire people that know how to get the job done.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:35:00
I have to wonder if some of their incentive to find it was because of Yakuza that had money in it. (remember, they are in Tokyo)
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:38:27
He's a tremendous showman, I'll give you that, but I think finding someone that could have more of a mainstream appeal would be better. I don't subscribe to the thought that all publicity is good publicity.

I'm aware of how to google something, what I am seeking is the experience of this community to provide me with ideas I may not have considered about the process.

@_date: 2014-05-05 20:59:29

@_date: 2017-08-04 16:04:41
I love that. From this point forward those coins should be referred to exclusively as Bitches!

All of them.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:41:56
Specifically which transactions are you talking about? Silk road stuff? That never did anything but hurt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:23:58
How are you putting it in a roth?
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:30:49
soooooo......free money.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:27:39
Me too. I forgot that I had one from 2013 until I got a notice that said to collect it before they shut it down. What was originally something like 0.25 cents turned into $20.....It got my attention enough to get back into this.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:41:22
I said that this is what it was going to end up being yesterday, and I was fucking right!
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:26:50
Does that mean the dip is over now?

True but the "wallet" with the key and the person that knows the key don't exist there and would be easier wipe out.

If you really want a rare stone, get emeralds or rubies.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:22:11
I love bitcoin, but I think that is a risk I wouldn't take. It is the kind of behavior that resembles gambling more than investing.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:04:46
I've got to be honest, I don't know where to buy other crypto outside of coinbase. The other exchanges just seemed too...overnight... for comfort.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:32:16
What do you do?
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:10:30
Here's the thing....does bitcoin really want to go seeking enemies other than the naturally occurring one? Seems counterproductive. When you go looking for enemies, you generally find them or make them.

Entropy wins!  Game over! Why even bother playing? /s

Or possibly when it's worth something again. Should be interesting to watch.

A company in China is really expecting compliance on a patent.... Other Chinese firms will be all over that without giving a single fuck. They don't have a real concern over compliance on this kind of thing over there.

@_date: 2017-08-18 23:02:25
Yes....damn linear time!
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:25:39
35 would be a trip back in time for me.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:04:29
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:40:06
NO! But I like rollercoasters so.... Just don't bet the farm and HODL, you'll either be happy in the long run or not.
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:21:21
I find that acceptable.... not likely, but acceptable.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:39:48
We love the doge, they are always welcome to join us on the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:09:17
I wouldn't mind seeing $1800 again.... but only long enough for me to get my buy in.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:24:35
I'm willing to bet that they are transferred far, far away from NK for just that reason.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:33:27
It was back earlier this year actually.... got me off the sidelines when I realized what I was missing out on. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:46:23
Why is this happening? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:45:49
I wish I had a long lost Nigerian Crypto Coin giving uncle!
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:19:07
How do you do that second part?
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:53:22
In my mind I see an entire nuclear plant's output directed at one hell of a large mining set up......because Russia.

I know how to make this rise stop...Put my next order in.......
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:59:59
I think I'll hold off on the GBTC for a while though. Seems to be a more expensive way of doing what I'm already doing at a much lower cost.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:03:16
You forget, that's who is in charge over there.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:48:57
Tell me about it.....Dollar cost averaging is how it's gonna be , I guess. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:09:11
I thought you were kidding.... Sweet!
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:18:11
Which exchange?
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:25:00
Yeah, that was the experience I had back in the day, I somehow stumbled into coinbase back when they first started though, so I haven't had any problems with them. I just wish I still had all the coins I had back in the day.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:10:28
fair enough, anyone heard about any predicted dips? I'm going to hold off until I see the next one.....
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:40:04
I do, and I can almost believe it just because I live in San Diego as well. It's always sunny, but if he isn't a complete bullshitter, he probably also has power hooked up as a backup, because we do have a few overcast days as well. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:03:38
That's a bad, bad , bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:24:22
In a small way, there is a common thread. Both of those items did enjoy a period of high demand. There were some people lucky enough to profit on both before getting wiped out. The main difference I see in them comes down to the utility of the product on every level. There are only so many things one can do with a flower or a stuffed toy. Bitcoin is a financial device. there is a lot to be done there.
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:45:44
Physical gold or a fund?
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:43:38
So it really is like cash, after all!

What China gives, they gladly take away with little or no warning....fuck those guys.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:58:40
So what caused this recent uptick? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:37:48
Just let your spouse know it's a better buying opportunity when it isn't going to the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:23:45
The one I've used charges about 7% a bit steep, but it is the fastest way to get credited in the dips for me.

I'm a nice guy and that much cash makes even me pause and think if I could grab and dash faster than him.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:28:30
Too not to
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:02:23
Thank you Haiku bot. I had no idea my comments were worthy of your attention. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:57:59
Very cool. I didn't know you could do that. I may have to look into my options there.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:30:24
It almost makes me think it's(BCC) just going to end up being another altcoin and all of this is just some sort of spectacularly elaborate marketing plan for it.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:45:09
Fart jokes would be an improvement over this. At least those are amusing.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:13:39

I do, but I also realize that for some people student loan amounts could almost buy a house. I think it's great your boss cares enough about you to make the gesture.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:59:30
Kid, put a little in over time. Just hold it and wait. your patience will be rewarded. Also learn about long term standard investments time and compound interest are on your side. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:18:24
And that is why we are also trying to get in that position as well. Our motto should be "Bitcoin: Making room at the top." But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:40:14
I see other coins prospering at the moment, but I only trust bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:15:20
Got it!

Good. I've been waiting for a dip to buy!

Bring the Doge, he deserved the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:52:38
Your statement had made me think that a lot of people are going to look into other coins for the money  not realizing that even if they only hold fractions of BTC it will also go the same way as a full coin. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:39:06
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:28:11

Speaking as a Lizard person, I rarely if ever wear turtle necks.... I've said too much.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:37:21
Not much, but I'm happy.
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:35:28
It went down to $1800-ish just last month.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:49:23
So they are issuing IOU's. basically fiat...without the advantages of even fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:52:57
You're not wrong. But still better to have some than not.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:09:56
Are they under the impression that they have the authority to do so?
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:20:47
Looks like 3978 for about 3/4 of a second an hour ago.....damnit.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:36:39
And that is part of the reason I uninstalled that wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:49:30
Anyone else nervous as hell about this? I ask as a HODLer edit: fuck it. I'll get a little more.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:23:59
Only if we're lucky.
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:21:08
It would probably be better to tweet it at someone who has a ghost of a chance of understanding it. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:28:51
I'm standing by my answer.
Serious answer, I'm expecting a pretty serious dip just based on history, but I honestly don't know when that's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:40:25
Taking bets on how long it will be until he blows it all.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:57:08
Is that part of the reason for today's price spike?
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:51:02
That is the second time we've met today Haiku bot. We must have a shared destiny.

Lease? Peasant.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:44:34
Unless they take the incentive to set up a wallet and then use a bitcoin ATM (where available).

Good. Part of a parents job is to keep you on your toes!
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:22:04
The username of the bot I was responding to.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:15:53
I think you meant to say "fried."

that's my plan!
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:19:37
He gave up the ones they knew about, probably... unless he really is a gigantic idiot.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:47:54
I'm Hodling those too, just in case....I'm not going to buy any of them until I can get a better idea of where it's going though.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:29:36
I think he meant below the predicted 2018 high.... That's so poorly worded it hurt me to read it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:44:00
When am you?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:04:41
I think that there is merit in HODL, as long as you include an explanation... to the moon...not so much.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:03:53
I was thinking that too
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:52:31
*sniff*sniff* smells like sarcasm and bullshit.... good dog.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:29:40
And, how are they feeling about it now? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:40:59
I'm too lazy to steal, but if anyone wants to just send me some that would be fine.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:33:11
We'll see how it goes..... I was damn near ready to pull the trigger thinking, well, maybe $4k is the new base. Glad I procrastinated for once.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:52:57
This comparison is apples and oranges. Paypal and Bitcoin are two different beasts.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:43:08
Again, I've never marketed myself as such. I just know a good thing when I see it.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:19:11
I use coinbase. Not too flexible, but I trust them.  I'll look into bittrex. What is your opinion of Gemeni? I hear about it from time to time.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:11:48
Did he eat his own dick like he said he would? Because that really would be mind blowing. I don't really even care what his reason for doing it is.
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:14:37
Nah, still not triggered. Try again. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:02:44
Fellow peasant, I hold it because coinbase won't let me sell it!
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:37:42
I have no idea.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:08:06
And that is why I am cost averaging.

@_date: 2017-08-29 16:50:12
I think you're right, and the drop is going to be spectacular when it happens, but I have no idea when that's going to be or what could cause it. I've been apprehensive since it was at 3500.

I guess it's dick eating time for John. then. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:51:43
Honestly, the only reason I visit that sub is to find out what's up with BCH (it's good to know) and even then it's hard to find out anything because they seem more focused on trashing this sub than discussing their own.
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:05:37
Can we take doge with us? He's always wanted to go there.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:49:46
I'm okay with that. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:28:24
It's his Polish cousin, I'm sure.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:04:06
I got out way back when it went from 200 to 500 (had some bills to take care of) and came back in around the time it was 18000 -ish, so I am currently up a bit. But what I think I would do is start putting aside fiat for a buy, save it up for when the next correction hits. Honestly I've seen this before, and I think it will adjust to a new "Normal" price for a while, but not just yet. I'm looking at around November or so. The thing is,  could be totally wrong, either way though it should put you in a better position for your first buy. (Never invest what you can't afford to lose)
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:53:39
It's okay. I originally bought at $200 sold at $550 right before it dropped back to $200... I thought I was pretty smart....Oh well, at least I'm back in even it's just a little bit.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:49:51
9:1.5 depending on the beet futures market rate at the time.

I'm not a dev, so I can't really contribute in the way you indicate, I can however support with participation.

Speaking of taxes... do they only need to be reported if you sell and take a capital gain or do you still need to report them if you are HODL-ing?
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:42:45

@_date: 2017-08-07 16:57:12

I was telling someone else on here the other day that about the only time I've heard that term being used previously was by hard core drug users referring to the rest of the non-using world. Despite the silk road history, it's not a term I would like associated with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:35:11
Your money in the bank is also worthless unless you pull it out too. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:48:39
Let's stop using the word "normie" It carries a negative connotation that I don't think we should encourage when we are also trying to advocate that bit coin is for all. 
@_date: 2019-08-04 06:23:22
I'm still good with calling it "Bitchcoin."
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:37:50
I can see by your comment that your internet speak is unsurpassed.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:58:04
I thought they moved that to the moon? (Iron sky)

Booo! Don't get the L, it sucks! Get the X, it sucks less!
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:45:32
Seems to be a lot of dick eating going on in this sub lately.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:32:47
You know what I think I'll do with my free coin? HODL, just in case it ever becomes a thing.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:45:55
People hate that which they do not understand.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:41:00
Fire sale! Also what fun is a roller coaster without a few dips?
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:29:52
What's to stop those guys from hording BTC for themselves? Nothing. They have the fiat to buy as much as their tiny, greedy little black hearts desire.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:05:48
But will the karma I had earned before be useful or will it now be known as Karma classic?

Hey, Logan...I'll take that job if it's still open.
@_date: 2019-08-21 19:50:08
By yourself, you are an annoying fuck, however if groups of people start asking/demanding a thing, you become a pioneer of a movement.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:00:52
This headline would seem a lot less sensational if they posted it in the actual number of bitcoin. 71.5-ish
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:32:06
Forks? WHere? When?
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:27:09
What fun is a roller coaster without any drops, right?
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:55:58
And that is why you never talk about your bitcoin...if you have any..... which I don't.
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:07:09
It isn't a very user friendly interface though.
@_date: 2019-10-22 01:34:42
HTC? No thanks.
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:57:55
I'm glad he likes it, but he really made his fortune selling seminars and books rather than what he was saying he did in those books.

That's cool, but as with any other investment, do your homework and don't under any circumstances invest anything that you can't afford to live without.

Speaking as a businessperson, they are overly optimistic and overinflated and only work in a best case scenario.
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:59:31
Agnes Nutter would be proud.

Someone explain what this means... and use small words.. I'm simple.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:44:53
I'm feeling a dip....but it may just be a very short one like last weeks.
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:53:44
No. It will go up, but not that much...that being said, I'll HODL some...just in case.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:59:57
More difficult since silk road was shut down....I've said too much....

Peace of mind knowing a bank will not have it's hooks in me. No landlord...Only property taxes, can't avoid those fucking things even with death.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:00:36
If you want speed, use ripple. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:39:50
I thought they were all already trillionaires.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:56:52
Coinbase wants to stay in business and build legitimacy. You can't beat the IRS, so they will have no choice but to comply.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:59:36
Might be time to look at some alt coin too. They're on sale now.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:26:39
I fully intend to pay off my house with it at some point.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:17
So, here we are at a tad over $9000.. For all of you new people. This is just how it is with bitcoin. Take a deep breath, relax and enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:28:20
In the short term it will rise, but I don't see it rising like it did at the end of 2017. It will be a more slow growth, and that isn't a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:49:14
Buy a house. Flat out in cash. Eat the taxes. make it a surprise to her. Tell her there is a mortgage, make up a reasonable amount and then put that back into savings or investments or even in coin. But stop renting, that it just pissing away cash. 
Give her the option to change jobs into something she likes. The money you have is great, but it isn't enough to live off of forever.
Clear out any debts you have. All of them. Debt is a relationship killer. 
Hold some of the coin for the future. Live frugally as to not raise suspicion of anyone around you about your true net worth. That brings out the wost in people. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:40:57
HODL. It'll be back, maybe not on your schedule, but it will be back.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:23:34
That is exactly what I mean. I'll buy and sell still though, just depending on what I need IRL.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:49:50
If I were already the richest man on earth, I could not care even a little if there were nudes of me. In fact, I might never wear clothes again. I would walk around naked just so it would be easier for the world to just kiss my ass.
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:21:20
Yes, and it is insanely fast.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:07:11
Good to know. Thanks for the instructional. That will be how I handle this from here on out.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:34:02
Before you had my curiosity. Now, you have my attention.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:25:50
Or it will all come crashing down... you have to detach yourself from the outcome and be fine with it either way.
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:06:08
Nothing short of a Cray can run Crysis. I thought that had already been established.?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:29:36
I would like to say Kraken, but it breaks down ALL the damn time! Way more than Cb does.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:44:51
There's no escaping them if you want to stay in this country or any country that we have extradition treaties with. Better just to pay up and get it the fuck over with, cause they ain't goin' anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:36:49
Well they had to make up for the Trump family security budget somehow. And now we know how. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:28:48
If that happens, switching to a different coin might be the answer.... just not Bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:22:43
What do you mean "You believe."? 
@_date: 2019-06-16 00:19:27
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:53:57
Someone should get him to do a follow up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:18:41
fair enough. If you still have heaps though, save it, pay for college..something like that. Make life easier for the 'rents.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:45:19
LInk us up! Lets see it!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:55:21
If we let him slide, well have to let Mcafee slide too, though.

If you don't mind the markup, just find a bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:38:34
Why panic over a purchasing opportunity?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:57:47
Why do you care?
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:26:15
Honestly, I think they still have a way to go before normalization will occur.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:55:44
Just to confirm, we only have to report when we sell, right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:02:56
I thought someone already bought one with bitcoin years ago?
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:50:07
Some one explain this to me, please use small words. I'm not with the smarticles.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:42:14
As long as there are money men, there will be fraud.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:18:44
so..... no fork?
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:52:56
Not all of us want to or have the ability to drop that much money on a car.
@_date: 2019-10-07 04:00:03
Shouldn't it be going the other way?
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:26:57
I thought it was cancelled? Is the fork back on again?
@_date: 2019-02-08 02:52:23
That guy couldn't look more like Mr. Burns if h wanted to.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:48:11
So you build your miners in an attachable ring around your water tank. May as well get something from it, right?
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:51:54
...and I will continue to avoid watching this show. God those people are annoying.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:45:48
I agree....but damned if it doesn't define the "No risk, no reward" ethos.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:21:59
Ok. It's going to be long term. I've never sold any coin so far.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:50:38
That works for me.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:47:13
Still beats anything you'd get in the bank....until it crashes.... and when it does, I recommend buying more.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:25:34
I'll need to visit the direct site more. Everything I've done has been transfer, I would rather have some on there for faster purchase.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:25:06
Don't forget that the Previa is also a mid engined beast. It's like driving your very own F-1 car!
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:56:57
We'll see. It doesn't do a whole hell of a lot so far. At least if it was a rip off, something would happen.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:51:04
Then why are you here?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:55:24
This should answer that for you 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:11:59
I love my credit union! They DGAF!
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:31:42
Probably fighting with the rockers someplace.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:33:30
I would love to use mine, however it seems only small local businesses that tried adopting it first stopped using it. I'm going to Japan in the next year or so, we;ll see if it's any different over there, I've heard it's exploding in the day to day use....We'll see.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:05:04
I'm still not going to use Gemini.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:33:37
Who knows...it would be interesting to see wither way.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:01:57
You can, there are sites that sell things for bitcoin, but I'd rather HODL
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:52:39
Where we're going, this may come in handy. 
@_date: 2019-06-05 22:43:01
look at Japan for how that's going it's been negative interest there for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:09:33
Oh, i don't think that will be required....I've got all kind of spare parts that are going.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:09:54
Yes. It's crazy. I hope that they don't become victims of their own success.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:56:25
Think telling him to HODL would make a difference? Not sure  this dude is in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:23:03
Glad to know I've been doing that right. is the capital gains tax still 15%?
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:20:04
He can vouch for that last part.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:35:00
I only use that one for shitcoins. i don't trust it with BTC
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:57:44
You're either a gambler or sarcastic...can't tell which.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:27:29
At least it would be backed by something then...
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:02:26
I would like to apologize for the next inevitable dip... I bought some at 72, so it's gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:33:47
You should be fine because I haven't bought any. My purchase guarantees a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:15:22
So what you're saying is that I should carry through with my plans to sell a kidney......
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:16:45
I think they would lose a huge amount of business. Most Americans tend not to trust overseas investment, and it's inconvenient as hell. Coinbase charges for their service because they take most of that pain away from dealing with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:36:48
So about $500k, then?
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:55:45
Screw that. I'm paying off my house...
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:18:45
In other words...Zoom Out.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:51:29
As long as my mortgage amount isn't revalued, that's okay.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:18:55
I'm not picky! Send it on over!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:30:26
That's normal info for banks and exchanges to provide, and as much as I hate to admit it, the IRS is correct in requesting the info. Gotta pay the tax man.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:52:22
It's not a monopoly. There are other exchanges people are more than free to use.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:46:23
Damn.... that sentence is poetry..... in disguise. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:57:30
can you ELI5 that last part, please. I always get lost in the technicals.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:24:16
I've got a little Ripple... it just kind of sits there not doing a lot, even when I poke it with a stick. I guess I'll just continue to let it set there.
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:54:17
HSBC operates on an entirely different scale than an individual investor. It's not a good comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:25:14
We should start a site together. My advice seems to be exactly as good as yours. OTHERS WILL MAKE FORTUNES!! You and I, sadly, won't.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:22:36
God I hope so.... so I can buy more for less.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:08:50
I think this is where economies of scale come in. It may be cheaper to buy it on a large exchange rather than from the individual, even with associated fees.  Even with the exchanges though, there is nothing that can prevent the exchange between individuals as well though, so I think that satisfies the Satoshi 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:07:36
This is Sparta!
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:57:31
This guy gets it!
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:19:34
Did he just sit there and smile awkwardly? because if he did, that would be awesome.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:58:42
I've had pretty good luck in this forum, actually. They seem to lurk here. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:46:00
Their economy has basically been stalled for the past couple of decades. They are basically flying in a hold pattern for now and the foreseeable future, economically, speaking.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:10:22
I've been hodling since 2013
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:27:41
Think long term my friend. You will be rewarded for your patience.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:48
I never said anthing about it being *my* kidney.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:02
Hmmmm..... I'm actually kind of tempted......
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:25:15
Personally, i was looking forward to selling off the new coin ASAP and buying some more BTC.... Oh well, probably won't be the last time that happens.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:51:46
Didn't say they were all good, just some of them.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:17:16
DUDE,IT'S NOT THE END OF 2017 YET AND iT"S STILL BELOW 10K.... at this hour....
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:47:47
I think a lot of them are just hoping for enough appreciation to pay off their nightmarish student loans. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:44:57
That would explain why it went up. I never sold mine, so I can't say I'm upset by this.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:02:34
Oh, I'm far, far away from hoisting that guy up, don't worry.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:02:31
Good thing I'm a HODLr, then, I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:28:57
Some of those weren't entirely bad investments.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:52:47
i just checked the BCH price. He has no reason to be unhappy.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:26:36
...and coffee. Don't forget the coffee in copious amounts.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:02:35
It's done it before...and survived. it came back stronger, it didn't GAF. Bitcoin is a honeybadger.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:20:25
Lower barriers to entry would explain that.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:35:50
Remember Icarus? The sun didn't work out so well for him. Mars is better.

Hook me up man!
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:46:12
I think there is going to be a huge, but probably short dip. I have absolutely no reason or science behind this, just a hunch, and it's the same feeling I had when I called $5500 as the new launchpad a month or so back.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:02:31
Not really. Just trying to figure out your context.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:56:26
I like to own things outright. Peace of mind.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:13:45
DILLY DILLY!
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:39:42
Explain to me how you are getting zero fees. I've used them for years and there is always a small fee.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:25:49
Is that also why you don't have access to your coin immediately just going through the ap?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:00:30
I'm a big fan of this animal rescue. All in home volunteers since they can't afford a facility of their own yet. I know the owner, if you pick them, i will help the group with their wallet setup.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:34:35
Maybe, but if it is, I would just buy more and hodl it until my next overseas excursion.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:57:10
Gotta catch 'em all!
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:27:15
Personally, i'm a HODLR, but if some want to take a little profit, more power to them... When I checked this morning at $11.5K, I will say the temptation was real...
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:56:31
For better or worse, that is one thing we are definitely good at, destroying shit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:26:13
So you have a long position on a drop, is that right?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:21:46
Well, I've got somewhere to sleep and I find that taking real estate, while not impossible, is more difficult than other assets, so yes.. i would like to have the house taken care of, free and clear. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:25:23
I won't ask how much coin you have, but I think you are a bit misinformed as to how to build wealth outside of bitcoin. Buy an asset, if you are going to cash out, not a thing that devalues.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:52
You don't need to mine it to own it though.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:35:38
speaking as someone that took YEARS to pay off mine, I will say this. FUCKING DO IT! Those loans set me so far behind financially where I should have been in life by my age it was ridiculous. Thank god for bitcoin helping me get caught back up to where I should be.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:00:24
Live and learn. Welcome aboard.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:32:15
Well, they add coin to them, but otherwise... .yup. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:16:51
It's hard to make Coinbase look good, but you guys are managing to do just that, at least for bitcoin, Litecoin and ETH. I only use Kraken for shitcoin exchange.... too bad.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:28
The fee depends on which exchange you use, but yes, if it is credited to your account you can turn around and sell it, no problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:15:13
DCA, nothing wrong with that. 
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:57:49
Will there be a dick eaten? Curious minds want to know!
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:05:46
I think you'll regret selling it in the near future. 
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:34:47
Just examine the post bubble economy of Japan and you'll see what's in store.

I don't know that I want to see Satoshi Nakamoto naked.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:22:40
If they do not have legal enforcement capabilities or asset seizure rights in your country, they are effectively stealing your money. I don't know Canadian laws, but it seems like it's time to call a lawyer.
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:16:55
Ohhh... That's a debate for another sub entirely.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:55:31
I'm preparing for a major dip.....preparing to buy more and HODL
@_date: 2019-04-22 03:59:51
They had their own sub-station?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:13:00
I've told you before, this only applies when *I* buy.

Yeah. I got that one too. Blocked the user.

This sort of thing doesn't really help the optics of bitcoin.

For 45, that dude looks like hell.

You know that you don't have to buy them in whole pieces, right? Dollar cost averaging is your friend.

When I see this, I always hope that whoever bought the Lambo, or other ridiculous car, bought a house first.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:10:21
Still faster than Kraken support.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:49:38
No, but I know how to treat my woman with respect. A lesson you obviously missed.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:56:54
Gnarly.... the one I used did not... it just had a ridiculous rate.

Now you're just being ridiculous about the price!

Thanks for the visit r/BTC!
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:45:46
I think the more it is adopted worldwide the less likely this becomes.

That's China.

If you bought your Lambo before you bought your house then you had it coming.

@_date: 2017-09-13 15:55:44
Must be nice, but if you had then you are basically been forced to get money from the government...money that you have to pay back with interest. So it's either that or pay in cash, which is something MOST PEOPLE cant do.

Lack of articles in a language isn't a problem.Japanese doesn't have them either....ask Satoshi.

Seems like we may be able to buy some lightly used mining equipment soon.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:28:01
I think the same thing that could hurt the big banks could hurt bitcoin. Death by a thousand cuts... not any one thing, just small ones that let it bleed out, slowly and painfully. Right now decentralization is what protects bitcoin until someone somewhere figures out a way to make that fail.
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:33:46
I will either ride my bitcoin to the moon or to the depths like the musician on the Titanic. No backing out. HODL til death do us part.

They don't have to mine it to buy it. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:09:22
No, you can still buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:38:29
I'm actually okay with that as long as it's only active while I'm watching.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:40:24
I'm sure you've heard this before but don't invest anything you can't afford to lose or anything that you are going to need in the short term. Buy it, put it away and HODL. It is the only way.

I have to wonder how many people in government positions around the world will look at this and try to find someone to blame for it, and view it as a threat rather than viewing it as a necessity that has probably saved people from starving at the very least.
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:40:10
Why not both?
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:51:50
I've done the math the answer is a metric shit-ton.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:15:33
Here's the thing, don't worry about what others are making in comparison, just worry about what you are making. If you invest nothing, you will not benefit, if you invest something, you might lost it all, but, if there is an upside, you will also get to experience that. it is a matter of patience and discipline in investing, even if it is just a small amount each paycheck.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:33:10

It's a readjustment. Just go pour yourself a beer at the pub and wait for the dust to settle. Continue to HODL.

@_date: 2017-10-12 22:21:50
Well if you want to make them feel better that you've not lost anything, just withdraw the amount of your original investment. You'll have not lost anything. Otherwise, HODL.

People still seem to forget that at the end of the day China is a communist country. That means it's all about the state having control over every aspect of life. Bitcoin is the antithesis of that, so it's no surprise they are banning it left and right.

@_date: 2017-09-11 18:22:04
I think they just did that for some time in the future. My guess is that e-cars are more networked and more controllable. Kind of hard to escape something if the government holds the keys to your ignition, so it makes sense that they would be all about electrics.

It's considered a special district now, and China seems to want to bring it more in line with the rest of the country and they are, but I'm just not sure how much control they  are actually exerting at this point.

Don't tell anyone, especially your ex wife! If you withdraw your funds you will be taxed, which is fair enough, if you have a mortgae, quietly pay that off and just sit on the rest of your coin. Save up the cash that you were paying on your mortgage, fatten up that 401k, buy some more bitcoin.

The only thing I can think of is to summon the coinbase guy that is on this forum, he answers here way faster than contacting them directly.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:51:37
I think encouraging him to save with bitcoin of fiat or gold or stock or whatever is a good idea. It's a damn good habit. It's an idea that has eluded many of the current generations, that is part of the reason we're in the mess we're in as a society.

It just depends on the future demand for bitcoin. Some say they will be worth millions each, due to their finite nature, others say less...just kind of depends on what happens seeing as how expensive they are, I'll be happy if I can just get 4-5 and set on them for a few decades.

I've been there. Get in the habit of sticking a little cash away at first, even if it's only $10-20/wk if that's all you can manage. The first thing you need to do, and I *CANNOT emphasize this enough*, get out of all of your debts first. Be fanatic about that. look around and see how people near you are living, not just on the surface, look deep. You don't want debt. Debt will make you  a slave. Source: Been there, done that. It sucked. I think getting out of debt while you are young may even be more important than building up cash. Without debt, you have a bright and shining future, with it, you only have payments.
That goes back to what I was saying about putting aside a small amount each week though, it gets you in a savings habit. If your company has a 401(k) sign up for it, just sign up for a market tracking ETF there. Max it out if possible for tax savings. You are young so the power of compounding interest is on your side. Take advantage of that. 
While you are doing all of that, make the time to study investing and find the right style for you. I love bitcoin but the risk is REALLY high, so while I hold some, it is just a part of my portfolio. You want to set yourself up in a way that if something bad happens in one area of your investments it will just be a setback rather than a deathblow. 
I know you may have wanted a more solid answe like "Invest in Cogsworth Cogs" or "Starbucks" or whatever, but there really isn't a right answer for that. i say, invest in what you understand. It's different for each of us, if you do the work, you'll find your interest. I hope that this has been helpful to you.

Hey, there's a prince there that owes a bunch of us a fortune! (Okay, i know you've never heard that before) Anyway, Nigeria seems to be ahead of the curve in tech on the continent, so what I think would be good, would be to organize some casual meetups starting with the more tech savvy that might have an interest in the technology, and then see where it goes from there. Nothing better than personal recommendations to spread awareness.

He was a proven success with his chicken, so this should be the same.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:08:00
That is pretty shady. Should prove to be a small boon for Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken then, when their users migrate to them.

@_date: 2017-10-31 20:46:07
Not everything is about a rise in value. Sometimes it is about having a base of operations and I didn't say he should have done it then, but it may not be a bad idea to do it now.
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:51:50
okay, so you may have to set up an account with Kraken or Gemeni etc, and see how that would work.

To be fair though, when they were being given away, they were about $1.00/ea.

@_date: 2017-10-12 22:27:54
I think risk is something that doesn't get addressed nearly enough on here. I agree with you. I've had enough to buy a a great deal of bitcoin but didn't. I bought a little instead and don't regret it because as good a it's been, it easily could have wiped me out entirely.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:45:01

Where do they hold these auctions? I always seem to miss out.
[edit] I just had a thought,  the government didn't lose out on anything at any price... They had nothing invested and made 100% profit because they seized all of the coins...fucking thieves.
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:23:39
This might sound off, considering the subreddit you're in, but XRP was designed specifically for cross border transactions, so maybe check to see if coinbase supports XRP the originates from Mexico.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:27:42
Well, I wouldn't advise him to go all in on it at his age, but I think the safest and easiest way for him to do it would be to sign him up for a coinbase account and start from there.

@_date: 2019-09-19 16:08:47
This is a stupid question, I know, but I need to ask....once the coins are all mined out, will there even be a hash rate? ELI5, please.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:35:51
That's fine if it does, I'll just buy some cheaper coin. What is your source?
@_date: 2019-09-17 19:20:19
I guess you could also do that with a paper wallet, if you're the patient sort that doesn't want to be bothered with coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:23:20
I agree with this, but I've never been able to understand that mindset. Were I rich enough, I would prefer not to deal with anyone else at all that I didn't have to. Couldn't give less of a shit about impressing the neighbors.

Question for you.....will the sudden increase in scarcity as a result of the sudden decreased mining cause a rise in rate?
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:50:46
Maybe a better way to put is is institutional exchanges. It's part of why and how Riple ended up joining up with Western Union.
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:54:53
Absolutely nothing. I've actually been concerned more about China doing just that.

It's a readjustment. Just go pour yourself a beer at the pub and wait for the dust to settle. Continue to HODL.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:34:30
Yeah, I can see that. I will occasionally see itm but even I pretty much just use it to fuel a crypto exchange addiction. Wouldn't mind using it in a store though. I am planning a trip to Japan in the next year or so, I'll see how it looks on the retail horizon there. I hear it's everywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:39:36
It's a good place to start. I went down some hard roads, I'd like to think I can help others avoid that way, if possible. If you take nothing else away from what I said take away what I said about debt. As much as I hate to refer to Dave Ramsey, he's right about debt. Do everything in your power to distance yourself from debts in your life and you will lead a happy life.

It's a matter of perceived image. USD gets a pass by most people because they are used to it. Bitcoin still has a stigma attached to it left over from the silk road days and things like this don't help it. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:58:08

Bitcoin is for everyone...but maybe you should take a step back for a while. If you can't afford to lose it, don't put anything in the game. Also, if you hold, you should be fine.

Depends on which side of the moon you are on. Light reflecting off of the earth's surface, on the earth facing side would probably block out most of the visible stars. On the "dark side of the moon" I think that the sky might actually look almost white because there is nothing blocking you from seeing the sheer number of stars that are out there. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:39:25

Coinbase, I love you and what you do, but it always strikes me as strange that it's faster to get a response from you on reddit than it is by contacting you directly via your website or Ap. Maybe tell someone there that can do something about that.

Maybe. Let me put on my tinfoil hat for a second....If a group claimed it to be their own product and were able to prove it from a legal standpoint, and this is all just supposition on my part,  they could make a claim that anyone else using it is using it illegally and attempt to have existing versions of it invalidated. I have no idea how that would be enforced, but that isn't really the point.
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:34:01

I bought high and held. I bought on the way down right about where it is now and held...Didn't have anything to buy with over the weekend when it dipped, but if I didm I would be holding that too. I'm holding on to this until it either all goes down in flames or until we have a glorious fortune sometime in the future! HODL is the only way!

There is a growing number of people that oppose that kind of manipulation, but the only real changes that will take place won't occur until after the older generation dies off. Don't generalize everyone there as racist though, yes there is plenty of it, but I've been all over the country and it doesn't seem any more prevalent there than any other place I've been. Other places just seem to do a better job of keeping a lid on it. I don't know if that is better or worse, but that is a different conversation for another time and place.

Okay, so think of it this way. You have a business and you have some guy walking in with his happy little klan robes on and he comes in. Now he hasn't done anything to you personally, but you know what he's all about. He may think Hitler was just a misunderstood soul and we should reconsider what he was all about. He's been outside talking to everyone about what it is he does and believes. He starts telling his buddies what a great company yours is. That's going to reflect on you and your business. Do you still take his money? Maybe you would. As a business owner, I sure as hell wouldn't. Same goes for anyone of any color or creed that is spewing hate. Take your business elsewhere.

Regulate bitcoin? Hahaha! Maybe regulate How, where or if it can be used within the Indian borders, but otherwise....good luck with that.

"...the CIA seems to have a consistent track record of fucking with shit as opposed to the NSA"
The difference is that the NSA rarely gets caught with their hand in the cookie jar. The CIA is blamed for everything anyway, so they don't really care if they get noticed too much.

Being your own bank doesn't do you too much good if you can't get to your money when you need it. That being said, I think there's more to the story OP isn't telling.

Hey, good for you. Here is what I would recommend that may help you. If you were broke before, continue living like you are still broke. BTC is going to fluctuate wildly. Don't watch it obsessively. I won't say forget you have it, just don't make it your focus, kind of like that cousin you have that you don't really like but you have to check in on every now and then because they are family after all. If things are going well in a year or so, maybe take your cousin our for a bit of celebrating, if it looks like things are not so good, continue to ignore him for a while. By then, you should have your regular savings built back up. Discipline is the key to success.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:57:14
Look a lot like where a bitcoin ATM would be located.

If it were about groups of people like him, then yes that would be illegal because it is systemic. But in this case it is about an individual and that person's behavior rather than a group of people like him. I'm sure he has a lot of money, that doesn't mean that me as a business owner is obliged to do business with him, especially if there are other available and comparable services. Just refer him to Gemini, they might not care.

First off I think I would tell them to hold off a while unless they are cool with losing some bucks while things settle down and that you can't guarantee a return. It isn't an asset, it is a currency that at the moment has a very high fluctuation.

If they are asking and you have an interest in helping them also become enthusiastic about it, then yes, baby steps. If you want to turn them off to the idea of it at all, then turn the geek talk up to 11 especially when you know that isn't where they are.
