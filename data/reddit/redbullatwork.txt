Doesn't that also apply to bitcoin?

Got me there, a ton of people lost money with ETH...
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:04:06

Hey hey hey... Bitcoin has done something... It rebranded itself as digital gold... That's fine... Ethereum is growing to fill the gap left behind.

Dogecoin of course.

This is my concern as well. My advice to people right now is to simply pull ALL currencies from ALL exchanges. So many things could cause any one of these services to go down, why risk it.

*we* did it for social rebellion, *we* were fighting the system.

It is actually the only thing they are good at. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:49:08
If you are investing in a technology. Ask yourself, what can bitcoin do that Ethereum can't? And Vice Versa     
  
  
  
If you are investing in an ideology, good luck.

Not enough to cover the fees.

I agree with what your saying, but what makes you say this? I don't buy the giant scary SEC shutdown theory, just because bitcoin is exposed to the same risks... even more so once Rootstock goes online.
