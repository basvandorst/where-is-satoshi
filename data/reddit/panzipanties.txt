i do not think you know much about law or financial systems. Bitcoin transaction systems record the party claiming to be responsible for the transaction.  For illegal operators, this is ALWAYS a fake name or sham corporate entity. In banking transaction systems, all responsible parties have licences whose responsible parties are REGISTERED with regulators. That is correct - any time a banking transactions looks suspicious-- BAM!!! BVAMMMBB AMAM!!! swat team hits the bank's owners's home immediately.. BAM!!! BAMMM!!! whereas with bitcoin -- WHO THE FUCK KNOWS WHO Shambitcoin Ltd is?!?!? NO ONE. You can record there transactions as permanently as you like -- and it MEANS NOTHING. Tghis is why bitcoin users are so STUPID. You guys are fucking up the world, fucking up the lives of millions of poor innocent girls. Making the jobs of many hardworking policemen and lawyers an utter misery. See HOW YOU LIKE SEEING YET ANOTHER TEN RAPED GIRLS, NEEDLE STICK MARKS ALL OVER, DYING, RAPED TO DEATH!?!?!?!? this is why i left the industry last year. too many horrifying images -- all of them funded by bitcoin.

absolute rubbish. the regulatory authority to investigate and validate those transactions is not as detailed as the banking system. Interpol has instant access to every banking transaction globally. The identity of every operator is fully detailed in licensing books. Bitcoin? FUCK ALL. All of the illegitimate operators work under aliases and untraceable entities in obscure jurisdictions. In the banking system, all of these guys are already traced to their true owners.
