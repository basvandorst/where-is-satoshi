Sounds like the disagreement is over semantics maybe?  Such as the words "performance" or "indication, or maybe the implied time period, or the accuracy of predictions?  
I think we can all agree that the future is based on the past with more or less gradual changes (a house generally stands in the same spot in a similar state the next morning, a stock generally has moved only a few percent up or down over a day - although sometimes the house has burned, or the stock has crashed.  But those abrupt changes happen only occasionally, mostly it's smaller changes, and thus the future on most days resembles the past).

Interesting solution on the anonymity problem.
However, being able to sell votes (or forced to vote a certain way) is the problem with most remote voting systems.  Selling votes will quickly corrupt a democracy, as the rich elite will buy votes from the poor who need money to survive their day-to-day life, further increasing wealth inequality.  Using cryptocoin tokens for voting will just make it much easier to buy and sell votes.
The best ways to arrange voting is still to have many physical voting locations with booths and sealed boxes to hold the votes,  then counting the votes locally by several people representing different parties, and publicizing the results so that everyone can verify the total results themselves.

The main advantage bitcoin has over dollars, euros, and other fiat currencies is that it has an upper limit on the number of coins that will ever be created.  
The reason fiat currencies fail or lose value is generally that governments and banks print more when they run out, which drops the value of the fiat currency (visible as inflation).  
So fiat currencies are not a safe store of value (the dollar for example has dropped in value to just about 1/100 of what it was worth a hundred years ago or so, wiping out any long term dollar savings).  Bitcoins are created at a slower and slower rate, until the total number of bitcoins in existence stops at around 21 million coins, so in the long term bitcoins can not lose value from more being arbitrarily created, like fiat currencies.
Gold (and silver) does work as a good store of value (an one-ounce gold coin used by a Roman trader is worth about the same today as then).  However, gold is very impractical to use for small, fast transactions over long distances (internet trade for example).  So bitcoin is more practical to use than gold for modern trade.
The advantage that fiat currencies and gold have over bitcoin is that many more people use and accept them in trade.  If very few people use bitcoin, then it is not worth very much.  On the other hand, if bitcoin adoption grows, then its utility and value will also grow.
There are also other risks with bitcoin, for example bugs could be found in the code or the algorithms used.
So in summary, bitcoin has better properties as money than fiat currencies or gold when it comes to store of value and ease of transfers, but it currently loses to them in terms of adoption and network effect.  Bitcoin is also a very new technology compared to fiat currencies and gold, so there could be various unforeseen problems not yet encountered.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:42:58
Okay, so you agree that the absolute value is likely to be similar, but not that the growth over time will be the same, or the speed of the growth.  
It's true that growth and especially change or growth can vary much more than the actual value, but they too usually have some continuity from one moment to the next in natural phenomena, as well as in stocks and bitcoin.  If you allow some variation around an averaged growth line (such as the bands in azops graphs), you can estimate the range that future values will likely fall in.  However, the values can indeed start to drift away from this trend when new factors affecting the growth come into play, or depart faster if there are more disturbing events.

Arbitrage - if price on e.g. btce was lower than gox, you could make money by buying coins on btce, moving them to gox, selling them, moving the fiat to btce, and repeating until the prices come close enough (a few percent) that fiat transfer costs and delays made the arbitrage unprofitable.
This worked until mtgox started having significant problems with bank transfers, which killed the possibility of arbitrage.

From a quick glance it looks like the code could have been much worse, this doesn't look horribly broken (although it could of course hide many bugs).  
But it is not high quality either, as it's hard to unit test (and tricky things like Bitcoin protocol code should definitely be unit tested).  The language used (PHP) does not facilitate creating the most error-free code. 
Other code smells are inlined constants and URLs, multi-thousand line program files, as well as commented out code blocks left in the production code.

Arbitrage will keep the price levels on different exchanges in sync.  So mtgox buying up bitcoins and the prices rising, will cause prices to rise on other exchanges as well (as long as bank and bitcoin transfers work).
Of course, I'm not claiming MtGox was the sole reason of the bubble - the rising price and the general uptrend got a lot of people to invest, and it would probably have happened even without MtGox fradulent buying.  MtGox probaly had a significant effect on the magnitude of the bubble, however.

This appears to be very unsafe, if emails and usernames are hashed with just one or two sha256 calls.  It would be easy for an attacker to brute-force the emails and usernames, especially if they started with lists of leaked Bitcoin related emails and usernames.
To make a brute-force attack against a hashed field impractical, the hash calculation has to be as resource-intensive as possible.  See [How To Safely Store a Password.](  
Even in that case, it's easy to test lists of previously leaked account names and emails, so if the account name and email you used for Gox are visible on the internet together, especially in some Bitcoin related context, it's easy for an attacker to test them and thus identify your balances.
As it stands now, I would not recommend using this tool, as it makes it easy for an attacker to compromise your anonymity, even if the tool upgrades to a more suitable hash function.
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:41:59
Good points, and a likely scenario if your assumptions are true.
However, it fails to take into account various risks and current limitations.
The blockchain will have a very tough job handling all the transactions if bitcoin replaces fiat currencies in the world economy, or just in some national economies.  Transaction fees would rise, and use for microtransactions of a few cents would be unrealistic, and even normal small transactions would be expensive.  However, it could still be used as a store and transfer of larger values, but for everyday use some other payment system would be needed (possibly using bitcoin internally).  Algorithm development and breakthroughs would be needed to scale up the processing speed without compromizing other features of bitcoin.
Mining centralization is also risk factor, as larger block sizes and steeper competition could push towards even more centralized hash power, until company mergers might concentrate most mining into one or a few global megacorps.  Although, as that would threaten the economies of every nation, anti-monopoly legislation and national investments in mining might mitigate this risk.
I can't think of any other serious threats at the moment, but it is always possible that something unexpected happens (hashing algorithm broken, a much better competing cryptocurrency adopted by a nation, etc).

It's also about usability.  
Humans and society in general are more used to working with large numbers than fractional ones.  We have thousand separators, and any decimals can be omitted if they are zero, making larger numbers wasy to read up to a million or so, at which time you'll have to start counting thousand separators more carefully.  
While for small numbers after three to four decimal places you need to start counting zeroes with more care, complicated by a leading zero and decimal point, and no thousand separators in the fraction.
So usability already dictates a base unit with fewer decimal places than non-decimal places in typical day to day amounts, to minimize user errors while handling money.
The naming of the unit can be discussed, but I think a base unit with two decimal places is the usable and future-proof alternative.

* Block halving could have been done gradually over time, instead of in one radical move every four years.
* Difficulty calculation could have been a bit different as well, to allow quick recovery from scenarios where the computing power of the network is abruptly decreased.  Although Bitcoin is probably past the growth period where this could be a problem.
* A base unit representing a smaller amount of value (uBTC).  A total of 21 million base units in a currency is way too few.
* He could have built in blockchain pruning from the start, to reduce the needed storage space.  This would have allowed increasing the block generation frequency significantly as well, speeding up transfer.
* It would have been good to have better anonymity built in into the core protocol, but that would probably have required some more research time.
* EDIT: More hashing algorithms could have been used, in addition to just sha256.  That would have increased the security and provided more future proofness in case one of the algorithms is cracked.  It might also have slowed down the ASIC and GPU mining a bit, spreading out the currency more evenly.
Most of these things have since been fixed or solved in many altcoins, but the consensus process makes it very hard to introduce the improvements back into Bitcoin.

Company market shares are distributed according to power laws.  So there is the biggest player, another about x% smaller than that, a third about x% smaller again, and so on (of course, that's a very rough simplification).  Turns out, in most markets the distribution is such that there's a handful of companies with larger than 1% market share, and the long tail afterwards with tens of thousands of companies with less than 1% market share.
So getting an 1% market share means being among the top few companies in your market - typically that means being a very big player.
Many people recognize the top companies in a market, but do not really have an idea about the actual number of companies in a market, or the size of the market, so the 1% market share goal doesn't seem as hard as it really is.

Volatility is inversely related to the market cap and directly related to the size of the market - when bitcoins are worth more, more monetary value is needed to move them (up or down), and when they are used by more people, there will be more need to sell and buy them, thus a larger liquidity in the markets.
Compare e.g. 2010-2011 or so, when a million dollar could probably have wiped out the order book on an exchange.  Now a million dollar will cause maybe a 10% wave if it is sold or bought all in one go.  Extrapolating to the future, assuming bitcoins don't die off and adoption goes up, a million dollars won't be enough to move the markets much of all anymore.  
So, volatility will go down as bitcoin adoption goes up (and if bitcoin adoption goes down, volatility will go up).  In other words, volatility is a function of market cap and adoption.

WWI and WWII were fought during a time when many fiat currencies were pegged to gold.

There's nothing inherent in large scale wars that make them impossible or significantly improbable without fiat currencies.

ASIC economics (big investments in custom chip and hardware design being rewarded with lots of hashpower) leads to the hash power naturally concentrating into a few large operations, thus putting more power in fewer hands, and increasing the risks of attacks on the network by infiltration or blackmail of the mining operations (and also distributing new coins in an asymmetric fashion) .
If an algorithm could be developed that worked best on normal home computers, the mining could be carried out by normal users in a massively distributed fashion, eliminating any large points of failure (although this would be vulnerable to botnets and such).
However, very likely any computations that can be done on a normal PC can be done more efficiently with specially designed chips and hardware, making the quest for a non-ASIC optimizable algorithm into a futile fight against the inevitable.

After reading the discussions in question, the tittle seems accurate to me.  Mike proposed adding a mechanism for Tor exit node administrators to block certain Tor services, with the option of the lists of services to censor provided by some central authorities or others.
Apparently he also advocated postponing a fix to Tor anonymization, on the ground of having to study the effects of the fix further.  I did not familiarize myself with this debate in detail, so I don't know if his desire to delay the fix is merited.
He was also called out for proposing the redlisting and greenlisting of specific bitcoins involved in crimes (e.g. silk road money), which would destroy the fungibility of bitcoins (the assurance that any bitcoin you have or receive will be of the same utility and value as any other bitcoin).  Fungibility is a required property of sound money, without it merchants would not want to accept bitcoin, as they could not know in advance if some coins they accept could become redlisted and lose their value.
Mike did write bitcoinj, but knowing his ~~political views~~ *stance on the above issues*, I'd want to have the code carefully reviewed before trusting much value in it (although the same is true for any code handling coins).

They did have wars before fiat currencies were used, so the message is factually incorrect.  Printing money is basically an additional tax on every saver, and taxes can be implemented without fiat currencies as well.
Granted, taking away the possibility of wealth taxation by inflation may reduce the money available for war, and thus reduce war (or at least the scope of wars).  But in the end, the corruption of goverment has a much larger effect on war than the taxation model.

If you wire money you borrowed to some merchant, you can buy stuff with it, and the seller just has to trust in the currency, not the bank.  
If you borrow IOU bitcoins from some fractional bitcoin bank, you'll have to find a seller that trusts the bitcoin bank to honor its IOU:s and accepts IOUs from the bank instead of actual bitcoins wired to an address.  
If people know the bitcoin bank is running fractional reserve, they know the banks IOUs are not actually worth what they claim to be, so in effect that will create a derivative fiat currency with a floating rate to bitcoin, where the exchange rate is determined by people's estimate of the fractional amount of bitcoins held by the bank to IOUs issued it, and the banks willingness and ability to honor the IOUs it has issued.

Incidentally, bitcoins market cap seems to be 5 billion dollars.  So it could have been a good trade.  (Of course, liquidating all bitcoins would not net 5 billion dollars as the price would plummet, so it would have had to be regarded as a long term investment (also, if every bitcoin in existence was held by one company, bitcoins would be pretty worthless, as there would be no network effect)).

It seems that Willy was operating even when other traders could not, when the exchange was down.
This implies that the attacker ran the bot from mtgox own machines, and/or bypassed the normal trading API.
It should also have been noticed and investigated by mtgox if it was an outside attacker (as trades going through when the network is disconnected is a pretty noteworthy thing), although it could be feasible that they just ignored it.
I don't quite buy the exclusive trading connection theory, as the volume and buying was quite regular - no advanced or fast trading was done, indeed, no selling was done at all, just slow accumulation.  That could have been done easier and cheaper by just using the normal API.  There was also just that one accumulation pattern, if there had been several users of the exclusive API, there should have been several different kinds of patterns (and sells as well).

You are right that just storing the bitcoins on your computer is not very secure, because risk of hardware failure or bitcoin stealing viruses.
However, storing your bitcoins at some service online is risky as well, many online coin wallet sites have lost their coins through hacking, or turning out to be scams where the operator runs with the money.  There are also risk such as governmental regulation / confiscation with online wallet sites, as they are centralized points that can be attacked.
Offline paper wallets are one of the more secure ways to store your coins for the long term, as you can take the same precautions to secure them that you do with any other small valuables you hold.  Paper also outlasts USB sticks or CDs as a backup media, if stored in reasonable conditions.  To be extra safe against loss from fire or similar, you can make a copy of a paper wallet and store it at another secure location.  You can also encrypt paper wallets, so that they require a password you have memorized or stored elsewhere to use.
 is one tool to make paper wallets, but don't just take my word for it, google the address and read reviews to make sure it isn't a scam site.

Depends on the voltage (and to some extent on the current).
Low voltages (12-24V) at high amperages require thick cables, or the cables will heat up quickly, and there's always risk for fire or equipment damage if they are short circuited.
As long as you handle the cables with dry hands and minimize the contact area with your skin they should be fairly safe to handle.  Don't impale yourself with a strand of cable or dunk your hand in a water bucket with a live cable though, as that will dramatically reduce the resistance provided by your dry skin and small contact area, and risk routing the power through you (which is usually deadly or very painful).

-&gt; Lots and lots of very small miners run by the same company :P
Centralization is a result of economies of scale - producing the mining chips is expensive, with a high up-front cost, but cheaper in large quantities, so you get a situation where only larger companies with a good financial and technical backing have a chance at profitable mining (access to cheap electricity is needed as well).
One way to combat that would be to redesign the hashing algorithm so that specialized ASIC chips do not have any advantage over ordinary computers.  In this case there would still be some advantage for large operations, but the ASIC chip arms-race (requiring large up-front investment) would not be there in the same scale, as generic computing hardware is already well optimized and available to everyone at a similar price.  Some altcoins try to use this approach, by nesting several very different kinds of hash functions, passing the result of one to the next.
Of course, changing the Bitcoin hashing algorithm at this point is not a realistic solution, and not likely to happen.

Gold is also more scarce than tin or lead (otherwise Romans might have built their water pipes out of gold instead of [lead]( and we could all be talking Latin (or not)).
The relative scarcity coupled with durability and demand for jewellery leads to higher value (lower supply than lead/tin).  The higher value allows easier portability of wealth, which makes gold (and silver) useful as money, adding to the demand as well (you could trade with blocks of lead as well, there's always some madman building water pipes or something out of it giving it some demand, but it's problematic to transport amounts corresponding to the value used in everyday commerce).

Anonymous voting allows you to receive bribes or threats, and then anyway vote the way you think is correct, not the way others want you to vote.  This makes bribing or coercing less effective, and thus decreases the incentives to spend money or effort on ineffective bribery / coercion attempts.
As for accurate ways to count votes, see my other reply below.
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:34:57


Local voting locations are usually held in schools, libraries, and other public buildings, serving the citizens in a few blocks of a city.  It's hard to get more distributed than that.
As for the central tallying, the people counting at each location verify that the central result publisher is representing the count for their local voting location correctly, and after that anyone can double check the final results by adding together the publicized vote counts for each voting location.


The idea with representatives from political parties supervising vote counting is that if there is any attempt at throwing votes, at least some of them have every incentive to cry foul about it.  And if you want to supervise the local vote counting yourself, many countries have legislation that allows citizens to observe the vote counting.  You might even be able to volunteer as a vote counter (in many countries the counters themselves have to be independent, while the party representatives are observers).

Even if it would be technically possible, there is also the problem that coercion or vote buying can be done if privacy is not enforced when the voting is done.  If people can vote from home/the office/anywhere with internet, then they can be bribed or forced to vote a certain way.
A way around that would be to allow people to change their vote multiple times, in which case you could change your vote if you were coerced / bribed.  That still leaves the possibility of the vote coercion / buying happening just before voting is closed, or otherwise preventing a change of the vote until voting closes.

Yes, in consumer heating applications in general.  Although a space heater would be more realistic, as it's something that needs to produce heat for extended periods of time at a constant rate, instead of a lot of heat fast for short periods, which means that the space heater makes much more efficient use of the miners before they stop producing any return on the investment.  A toaster would need a lot of heating capacity (=asics), but would only use it for 10 minutes per day or so, wasting the potential return on the investment from mining.

TL;DR:Public votes enable vote buying and coercion.

You don't want to waste battery life in portable devices like phones by turning it into heat and fractions of fractions of pennies.  And you don't in general want extra heat output in things like cable boxes, which would require installing fans and making them noisy.  
Washing machines or dryers need heat, but only for short periods at a time, so the higher cost of the bitcoin mining chips as opposed to just a simple electric heater would likely not be paid back by a few hours of mining every few days.
But using bitcoin mining chips as a heat producer in A/C units during cold months could make some sense.

Yeah, probably if you went full on vote buying directly in the current culture.
But those things tend to be slippery slopes, especially with a positive feedback mechanism included.
If you had public voting, initially you'd have candidates discreetly offering some compensation or advantage for votes, or threatening you if you don't vote for them (e.g. large company owner raising wages for people voting for him, and putting people who didn't first on the list to be fired.  He could do that without overtly claiming to buy votes, but people would see the consequences after a few elections and try to maximize their own salaries and employment).  
The ones who succeed in buying most votes have a larger chance to get elected, and will try to influence the laws and public discussion in a direction allowing more blatant vote buying or coercion.

For a small assembly like a parliament, it could go like this: You write your vote on the ballot without anyone seeing, then put it in a ballot box.  Then when everyone voted, shake the box a bit, and someone fairly neutral or trusted picks up votes one by one and reads out the result, while a sufficient number of people with different stakes in the outcome stand by observing that the votes are read and counted correctly.
For how to do it for larger amount of people (a nation), see the other answers to that question in this thread.

Yes, this is a cycle that tends to happen to fiat currencies.  New bills with higher denominations are introduced as the currency inflates.

The current way to count votes normally works like this:
* Every voting location counts the votes placed at that location, with representatives from every party (and any interested citizens) present to verify that the counting and handling of the votes is correct.
* Voting locations submit their counts to a central place, that assembles the final result.
* The central location publishes the counts from each location, so that the people present at the local locations can verify that the published counts are not tampered with, and so that anyone can check that the final result is correct.
Some countries have replaced this traditional system with ways that allow manipulation of elections, for example with voting machines.

So in that case you could make a transaction that exchanged normal bitcoins for a colored coin, faciliating trading of shares.  
How would the colored coin be recognized as colored after it entered some address with other bitcoins already in it?  Or do you need to keep colored coins in their own addresses?
Would it be possible to publish open transactions through some route where you give out a colored coin in exchange for some specified amount of normal bitcoins, or the other way, and then someone else could complete the transaction with their coins as the counterparty?  In effect, allowing you to publish bids and asks for different colored coins, in a way that would be very easy to decentralize (I guess one issue with this would be how to cancel a bid or ask you made).

Unlike bitcoin, the supply of oil varies according to availability in the ground and economic policies, and the demand is very inelastic, so you get intermittent periods of higher volatility later as well.  Also, early on supply was small, while it grew later (so price started out high), unlike bitcoin which has a steadily decreasing supply.  In that respect oil is not a good analogy.

What OP is describing is the number of possible bitcoin addresses, not the number of existing bitcoin addresses.
All bitcoin addresses with any transaction history are visible in the blockchain, and while there are many, there is a quite manageable number of them.  
I'm not exactly sure what you mean with passphrase for an offline wallet, but assuming you mean a brainwallet; if you use a brainwallet with a weak or non-existent password, someone will crack it about as soon as you move some money there.
However, when you generate a new address, you can be practically certain that it won't be the same address that someone else has already generated (and thus also posessing the same private key for).

In addition to the major credit card companies, large banks, paypals, western unions and the like, there are a lot of smaller banks in different countries, various smaller online payment processors, payment processors focused on a certain niche field or geographical area, and so on.  So if you count the smaller national competitors as well (the long tail), there is likely many more than 1000 competitors.
I also can see Bitcoin growing to equal the volume of one of the larger established actors, but currently it is at the level of a small mostly unknown niche payment processor.

Armory refuses to send money to that address, maybe because it starts with 3:


Mtgox also refused with a similar message.

Yes, essentially like that.  Of course you have to trust the originator to hold onto their side of the original contract (pay dividends for example), but there's not much point in investing into something you don't trust anyway.
The blockchain itself keeps track of who has what amount of shares, so for the bookkeeping you don't need to trust the originator of the shares or a third party exhchange, just the bitcoin protocol and blockchain.

[An estimated 75-100 people die each year in USA because of peanut allergy.](
There was [49 deaths by terrorists in USA 2012](  (2012 was an especially bloody year, most deaths on the list are from a school shooting and the Batman movie theater shooting).  2011 had 11 deaths by terrorism in USA, 2010 had 4, and 2009 had 32.
For comparison, [last year 28 persons died from lightning strikes in the USA.](
So on an average year, you have way more people dying from peanut allergy than terrorism, and a roughly equal magnitude dying from lightning.  Of course, 'normal' criminal murders are a much higher risk than any listed here.  And the real killers are naturally tobacco, fast food, and cancer.

If you want to store larger sums, create an offline wallet on an old linux laptop using Armory or a similar peer-reviewed open source client, and make a few paper backups and store them in secure offsite locations.
Webwallets have a pretty bad track record for security, in general you should not trust the safekeeping of your bitcoins to anyone else.
Edit: You could keep some funds in a webwallet for small quick purchases, just assume that you will loose all of them to a hack or theft within a year with a 25% probability or so.

Only use code from developers you would trust your money to, or read and understand the source before compiling and running it.  
As someone already said, any address generator could use a deterministic scheme, with the original author holding the root seed that can be used to re-create all private keys generated with the generator.

It would be feasible if you could withdraw and deposit both bitcoins and dollars to both exchanges.  
Unfortunately MtGox has serious delays and problems with USD withdrawals, so when people want their dollars out fast, they need to buy bitcoins on MtGox, move them to another exchange, and sell them there.  This drives up the bitcoin price on MtGox compared to other exchanges, and reduces arbitrage to a trickle due to the increased risk that the price moves before a dollar transfer to another exchange has been processed.

It's a result of other parameters: The initial block reward was 50 bitcoin, and it halves every 210,000 blocks (which works out to approximately every fourth year, as the target rate for blocks is one per 10 minutes).
210,000 blocks * 50 bitcoin + 210,000 block * 25 bitcoin + 210,000 blocks * 12.5 bitcoin and so on until the block reward is so small that it rounds down to zero, adds up to around 21 million bitcoins in total.

One way to invest is to invest in small portions over time, that way you get the average price and avoid the risk of buying just at a peak.
For example if you are ready to invest all of that $5000, you could buy $1000 worth of bitcoin five times, maybe a few days or a week apart, depending on how much you want to average the price.

Sounds a bit risky, wouldn't use for holding large amounts.  
Corrupt or incomplete transfers, or phone crash / error could lead to permanent loss of the coins.  And I've run into enough of those to not dismiss them offhand (android phones for example will kill apps if they are running out of memory, or you could accidentally drop the phone while fumbling with reading the card and the battery pops out, wiping the RAM before the key is committed to flash).

If 1 bitcoin goes to a value of $1 million, a microbit would be a nice $1, and a satoshi would be a cent.  
That would mean no really small micropayments, and minimum transaction fee would be a cent.  On the other hand, transaction with smaller values than one cent would bloat the blockchain anyway, and if needed it would be possible to add decimal places.
Overall I like the idea of using microbits in the future.  For now bitcoins or millibitcoin is sufficient, but it would be easy to add support for showing units in milli or microbitcoins to software.

People can always vote with their feet as well. 
If the developers did some unpopular change and all miners adopted it, people would sell their bitcoins and buy some other cryptocurrency that they like more.  In that case bitcoin price would drop and the value of better alternatives would rise.  
In general miners and developers have an interest in keeping the bitcoins valuable as they often own some themselves, but even if they went ahead with the change it would not be too hard for people to create / find better alternative cryptocurrencies.  
(This is actually a somewhat similar mechanism to the one that discourages forks in open source projects - anyone is free to create a better fork if the original developers do some unpopular changes, as the source is free to use and modify, so developers will tend to avoid unpopular changes to avoid loosing users and contributors).

That depends on how long each try takes.  One point of a strong password hashing function is that running it is so resource intensive, that bruteforcing a reasonably long password will take prohibitively long.  
E.g. if it takes a minute to check one possible password on a top end desktop, then even a three character password can't be immediately cracked, while a 15 character password probably will last several thousand years.

Sure, but was claiming that a 1970 microcomputer would be sufficient to brute force the password.
A botnet is a distributed supercomputer, and naturally has a lot more processing power.
Still, the effort to bruteforce a password goes up *exponentially* with the number of characters in it: characersToPickFrom^passwordLength.  Exponential growth is powerful:
If you use a hash function with enough iterations (e.g. [bcrypt]( with suitable parameters), so that it takes one second to test a password on a good computer, and use a random password with letters, numbers, and special characters, [**it will take about the current age of the universe to crack a 20 character password even if you converted the mass of the whole earth to a botnet of 4kg computers.**](

That sounds pretty bad for the Chineese exchanges.  If I understood that correctly, banks are not allowed to provide bank accounts for exchanges, and exchanges in themselves could also be seen as Bitcoin - RMB or foreign currency exchanges, and thus be forced to close.

Typical top of an investment cycle.  Total euphoria, people pointing at the unsustainably of continued exponential growth are shunned and attacked.
That said, people buying now will be very sad once it crashes, but if they hold on to their bitcoins for a few years they will probably make nice gains.
But when we reach the final mainstream exponential rallies before the price stabilizes, a lot of average joes will be burned quite badly when they buy into the last bubble at the top.  It could be similar to the dotcom bubble in 2000s.

Did some quick research about that claim of a built in 3G chip on vPro processors, and came to the conclusion that it is likely a false claim for these reasons:
* The original claimant fails to provide any proof of them
* If they were actually on the 3G network they would have raised attention at telcos around the world (as well as radio hobbyists)
* A metallic computer case acts as a [Faraday cage]( blocking most radio waves in or out of the box
* An antenna built into the actual chip will be quite innefficient to begin with, and there is no evidence of it [on the die (core i7 pictured)](
vPro processors *do* contain a built in extra processor, that uses the standby power from the power source to run even when the rest of the system is shut down.  It can be controlled over LAN, and can access other parts of the system.  It's [intended use is for remote system administration]( and there are some bios settings for turning it off, but it's anyone's guess whether it can be completely turned off and whether NSA has some master key for it.
This rumor might have started because if the vPro processor is used in a laptop with a normal 3G connection installed, [the comuter *can* be bricked remotely]( (in the name of protecting data in case of theft, of course).

Ask rather, why 50 bitcoins as initial block reward, why one block every 10 minutes, and why halve it every 4 years?
Because that determines the maximum number of bitcoins.  Those numbers are in my opinion a bit rounder and easier to understand than the end total of around 21 million.  
Four years was probably picked to give a suitable halving rate to encourage a fast adoption, yet provide block rewards to incentivize mining for some time, before relying on the bitcoin economy to have picked up enough that transaction rewards alone motivate mining.  
One block every 10 minutes allows the network ample time to propagate information, avoids filling up disk space with the blockchain too fast, while providing a reasonable speed for transactions.
And finally 50 bitcoins as the initial block reward is the right magnitude to end up with a total number of bitcoins that is of a size that can be easily represented by computers, and 50 is also a rather round number (100 might have been rounder, not sure why it was not picked, 10 or less would have given a fewer total number of bitcoins, and thus less precision to represent value with (fewer currency units)).

So, if a Finnish person was daytrading bitcoins, they would have to pay 30% tax on each profitable trade, but not be able to deduct the loosing trades from the taxable profits.  In a year, they could easily end up with tens of times more taxes than what their whole trading capital was.
Seems to me these guidelines are simply insane!
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:07:58
Sell them now at a profit while you can.  We are at the top of a speculative bubble, if you hold onto them for long they could loose 50% or more of their value for half a year or more (see the previous bitcoin bubbles on June 2011 and April 2013).
After the upcoming correction, you can reconsider investing in bitcoins at a lower price.  In the long term (5 - 10 years) it is likely still a very profitable investment.  
If you decide not to sell now, at least do not panic sell them at the bottom of the correction.  Even if they are overpriced now, you'll likely get return on your investment after a few years.

It might be possible to do something fancy with timed transactions, so that you could have something working like a [dead mans switch]( - if the wallet / storage service goes silent, the funds are moved to addresses controlled by the owners after some time.
[NeoBee]( solves this problem by having funds in accounts with three keys, out of which two are needed to move them.  One key is with the owner of the account, one with NeoBee, and one with an independent law firm.  It allows these use cases:
* The law firm and owners can move funds from the account to the owners in case NeoBee goes insolvent or otherwise goes unresponsive.  
* The law firm and NeoBee can move the funds to heirs upon the account owners death, even if the account owners password can not be found.
* The user can move funds in normal transactions as desired and accepted by NeoBee:s account policy together with NeoBee.

If you manage to break the bitcoin protocol, and generate new coins from thin air or spend large amounts of other peoples coins it would likely be discovered pretty fast, so you need either a quick way to convert your bitcoins to some other form of value, or else slowly spend other peoples coins and hope they don't notice.
There's [close to 15 million USD]( in bids to buy bitcoin on MtGox, probably a similar amount on Bitstamp.  However, if you bought all the dollars in the books there, your dollars would still be stuck in the exchange, or on a slow bank wire on their way away from there.  Bank wires are possible to reverse, and it's hard to get that kind of money out from the banks anonymously.  If you bought gold online with the bitcoins instead, the gold dealers would at least have your reception address.
So to safely and anonymously utilize the breach, you would have to try to keep it unnoticed for long, slowly converting bitcoins to other assets.  This increases the chances that the breach or your use of it is discovered before you can capitalize on it to the tune of a hundred million dollars, as suggested by the parent.  You could probably get some sizeable amount out, however, before the breach was detected.

Reviewing code for backdoors is a challenging even to experienced programmers.  In this case you'll just have to trust that others have reviewed the code, and would have raised an alarm if there was something suspicious.  
Old and popular open source clients have usually had most people review them, so to minimize the risk of backdoors in the wallets you use, try to avoid any new wallets or bleeding edge versions.  Also avoid web-wallets or closed source wallets, as no-one is able to review the code of those.

Spot-on description.
Near the top, many invested more than they could afford to loose, on a weak understanding of the long term strengths of the bitcoin protocol, sometimes even on borrowed money.  When the upward momentum starts to falter on it's exponential growth curve and crash down, their anxiety will slowly turn to panic, and they will sell their coins when the price is already plummeting.  Dropping prices and panic causes more panic, and people will be quite blinded, in the same way that this mania has people blinded to the unsustainability of continued exponential growth.
Trading well in any market, and especially such a volatile market as bitcoin, is about overcoming these emotions in yourself, and analyzing the market objectively, without regard to your own current position or the prevailing emotional atmosphere.

A transaction with a very small value.  For example someone moving 0.000001 bitcoin (about $0.0005 or so, if I counted the decimals right).
Miners are not keen on including them (unless they have a transaction fee), as they take up place in the block that could be used for transactions with larger fees.
They also tend to spam the blockchain, adding to the disk space requirements of all miners and full bitcoin clients, so people do not generally like them.  For this reason there were some changes to the default bitcoin client (used by many miners) recently, which requires dust transactions to have a transaction fee included.  The fee is often larger than the value of the actual dust transaction, making moving dust that has collected in a wallet problematic.

The seed is used to create a series of private (and public) keys for bitcoin addresses deterministically (meaning the series of generated addresses will always be the same for the same seed).  When the wallet needs a new address for receiving coins, it generates the next private key based on the seed and the number of already used wallets.  
Later if the wallet is restored from the seed, the wallet software starts from the seed and generates the same private keys, it can then use the public keys to check for the balance of each address.

It appears that they store messages in cleartext on their cloud servers in normal cases (although they have an end-to-end encrypted chat type as well).  Why not end-to-end encrypt all messages?  
It would require each user to copy private keys between any devices they personally use, but it seems that would be worth it if you can be sure that all messages are encrypted end to end.

The problem with online voting is that you need a system where:
* Each person with voting rights gets one vote, and not more
* Each vote is anonymous, and can not be associated with a specific person
* Voting result is verifiable by everyone
If you drop the anonymity requirement it's relatively easy to implement - you just sign your vote with a unique private key distributed to each voter by whoever decides on voting rights, and publish the vote - then everyone can sum up the votes and discard duplicates.  However, you usually want anonymity to ensure people can vote as they want without threat of retribution or promise of reward for how they vote.
