joining the pack never works if you are interested in alpha (above market returns) this is true by definition.
The 50% cut from the top is missing from your narrative.

of course it does. It gets all the rewards from the network (block reward + transaction fees) but then it takes fees off of that number.
Just because something has worked in the past, that does not mean it will continue to work in the future. No asset has ever increased in value as much as Bitcoin, thinking this will just continue is blatantly naive.
Success in investing is not built on doing what everybody else is doing but by predicting future outcomes better than the market average.

better to invest in the bitcoin directly, it is basically impossible to make money mining at this point.

it decreases the variance of the payout dramatically and lowers the expected payout by the fees claimed from the pool (the longer you mine, the less the variance aspect matters)

yes. It is not hard to figure out. the expected payout you will receive from mining bitcoin is your share (h) of the hash rate of the network (H) multiplied by the network payout from block creation &amp; transaction fees multiplied by the exchange rate minus transaction costs.
Here's the hash rate you'd have to fight against:  
The $50k will buy you mining hardware that quickly deprecates in value - you also have to pay electricity and take care of setup, maintenance, cooling and protection of the mining operation. At such a small scale and with conditions in most western countries that will be impossible to execute profitably.
