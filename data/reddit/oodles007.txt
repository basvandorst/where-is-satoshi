Your last post you dumbass, you said you were giving advice, so I was responding lmao I'm glad your memory is working exceptionally well for you these days...

Yeah if you aren't getting fresh seed keys from the device throw that thing in the trash

You call that advice? Haha it's a scam but yeah thanks for your sage advice encouraging me to get scammed. You're obliviously the one getting emotional, whining about "personal attacks". I don't care, I'm just laughing at people like you who think bcash is a solid investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:26:31
Yeah but look at the chart, the recent run was pretty distinct. Also Bitcoin has dipped 30+% multiple times, at once like 80% (not too long after I bought in, lol)
Just basic risk management tells you to dollar cost average your way in with multiple buys. Going all in at once is pretty greedy 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:35:04
I've done my part- not only have I pulled everything BTC from coinbase, all my ethereum is withdrawn as well. My business with coinbase is over- I will never be back, I will never miss it 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:57:42
Lmao you're really shaken up about this I can see. personal attacks wow those are personal attacks? Yeesh how sensitive...settle down there with your paper thin ego guy 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:42:44
The hodl people are the reason Bitcoin lives on. Every time people try to kill it, the hodl people buy more, essentially locking up more bitcoins, driving the price up higher. Hodl people are the support. 
Owning Bitcoin IS using it. It's decentralized wealth. That doesn't mean you have to buy coffee with it. That notion is pretty ridiculous. Sure we want people to be able to use it whenever and however they choose, but to say Bitcoin is irrelevant if people are using it to store wealth outside of the centralized system, wow... Not at all. You're missing the point of this movement sir
If storing bitcoins is a waste of Bitcoin then your bank account is a waste of money...
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:47:23
you mean the free coupon coins? That's a pretty sweet scam. Get little "copies" of your Bitcoins, call them Bitcoin cash as to confuse n00bs, sell them your Bitcoin coupons, profit
It's like an investment you don't even need to invest in, but the next guy does. Fuckin priceless 
I wonder who the idiot is that bought mine for 3k lol I got to load up on NEO with their donation. Idiots 
They don't even realize it until lightning network is fully adopted, then the "wait a minute" moment will kick in LOL

Correct! Though I would still protect my device in case a security vulnerability is discovered that hasn't been made a known issue yet. 
Though it protects against any kind of disaster. if you have your seed words in a fire proof envelope, and your house burns down- you're still good. 
I would also recommend incorporating your words into sentences or a story in a way that only you know how to make sense of- and putting it online or in another physical location somewhere, just in case. 
Btw with the new scam discovered as people selling scam devices and stealing the coins with the seed word, I'd use the same method I do with transactions- put like 1/4 in there, wait a few days to see if it gets stolen. I know someone who actually prefers to use multiple trezor/nano devices, just to make sure his eggs aren't all in the same basket. Better safe than sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:41:45
Oh I'm starting it? Because you didn't just call me a 5 year old in your last post? Lol wow everyone watch out, we got another "victim" over here. How pathetic.

I seriously highly doubt it when a couple weeks seems to be an eternity for you. I've been in for years, which is why I'm not freaking out about rolling lightning network out RIGHT NOW CAUSE OMG BITCOINS GONNA DIE IF NOT

Well core Bitcoin locked in a Trezor, nano, etc and daily Bitcoin just paid into by paychecks and spent on regular purchases. 
Lol but you need a sustained flow of hookers and cocaine, you gotta work up to that- if you spend all your money on one night then you're back at square 1 again
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:18:16
Good lord why would you buy a trezor off eBay for your fucking life savings. Holy shit. I wouldn't keep 20 dollars on an eBay trezor lol 
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:23:39
Apparently we are because you seem to be reducing the entire BTC revolution down into some cheap get rich quick thing where you expect the developers to sloppily throw together whatever they can to put money in your pocket in the short term, no matter if it all implodes 
Who cares if some alts get popularity? First of all Bitcoin isn't the only disruptive tech out there, second of all Bitcoin is going through a temporary slow down- and it's also the only one people are shorting. As a result it's becoming less volatile. It's just a matter of time before any other legit crypto will have the same growing pains. 
You must have bought in pretty recently to be so impatient and spoiled. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:20:33
When you're talking about selling, now we're talkin trading... Which can be very profitable but no it's not easy. 
You might be able to catch some of the bigger moves but BTC is a 24 hour market, I'm not cut out for that type of commitment. Can I go to bed? Nope, I haven't bought back in yet, and it could be +$2000 when I get up? Guess I'm staying awake tonight lol 
But if you want to go long, you just buy in, save some money for when it dips and buy more. THAT is easy. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:21:09
Try some homework- seqwit wallets and lightning network channels are increasing more and more every day. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:33:24
Nothing wrong with buying in, but you have to have a little common sense and not put 100% of your dry powder in after a big bull run. you should never complete an accusation during a bull run, you should always complete acquisition during a dip so that it brings your average down... 
Sure, buy at 20k- but if you really don't save some cash to buy a dip, you are asking to bag hold. This goes for every investment known to man 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:14:52
Not that anyone "deserves" misfortune but if you go "all in" at an all time high after multiple days of massive gains.... Let's just say you should stick to a savings account

Oh are they? Thank god we brought in a fortune teller guys. That was a good move 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:21:37
I got tired of people at work asking me about Bitcoin "dude it's crashing are you gonna sell? Are you selling?" 
For the last time fucking NO i told you I was holding 
*guy sells for 11.4k* 
*bitcoin bounces back*
"Dude should I get back in? Is it going to keep going up" 
Fucking hell. Now when people ask me I just go "idk" and nothing else 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:01:05
Yeah he did, he said his friend was the one who got angry at him when he said coinbase was insider trading, seems to indicate his friend was the one upset enough to cut him off 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:11:02
Then the hacker gets some weird ass sentences or story he has no idea what to do with in the first place, and even if he does, pick 24 random words out of like 500 to use as a seed as well as enter them in the correct order? I think it's fairly safe :) 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:37:23
My last transaction was less than that and I transferred hundreds of dollars. Soooo no 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:49:09
I'm glad you did, every Bitcoin holder got to sell their free coupons to people like you, who are now holding the bag as bitcoins transaction times and fees get lower everyday- soon to make bcash totally pointless
It was from the very beginning, a short term scam as a means of extracting as much money as possible from noobs, while getting to use as little capital as possible for the initial investment- all set to go down before lightning network is implemented, therefore making the scam coins and the entire point of the scam, useless 
I'm sorry for you. But thank you for buying my bcash. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:37:55
They aren't slow they're carful- bitcoins security and trust factor (meaning devs will never rush a rollout just to make more $ and risk fucking the entire Bitcoin project over) is what makes it so valuable. That's why Bitcoin is king. Lightning network is coming, this is a blip of time in the grand scheme of things, so I really can't comprehend why people are so impatient and think Bitcoin is going to get killed by another coin just because lightning net takes some time to implement. It's a twitchy, absurd assumption and line of thinking. Maybe people are just spoiled by some coins going 100% in a few days? Idk.
We've seen ETH isn't a perfect solution either- look at the transaction times today. ETH caps out at like 30 txps. That's not good compared to NEO which can do up to 10,000 txps. ETH is trying to change protocol to work similar to NEO but again, changes take time, and you don't want them rushed. Trust me. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:50:17
HODL since $500. Best move I have ever made in my entire life. Thanks everyone and happy new year!!!! 
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:02:06
Well to be fair it doesn't necessarily mean you don't spend in Bitcoin, just that you don't sell out your core position. If you're gonna spend 20 bucks on a pizza anyways sure pay in Bitcoin, why not? 20 bucks is 20 bucks whether you're gonna pay in fiat, or convert to BTC and pay that way 
Mmm I can agree that it's not a SMART use of your money, but it still maintains its value when sitting in your bank. A waste of money would be like blowing your savings on hookers and cocaine leaving you with nothing left lol 
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:46:37
I don't see that implication..? basically just states what is backed by what and said bitcoins value doesn't come from any kind of backing, it comes from its unique traits 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:17:56
When it feels like the market is playing YOU specifically, it just means you're fitting in perfectly with the overall market psychology. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:25:18
I see what you're saying but I'm more on the line of thinking that crypto and fait will co-exist for at least a very long time 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:02:52
It's brand new. most people who know about it have just heard of Bitcoin in the last couple months. And most people haven't even heard of it yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:26:23
Because it seeks to solve a problem that already had a plan to be solved. Lightning network is rolling out now, so literally the entire use case for bcash was valid for... A couple months..? And the people creating it KNEW lightning network was right around the corner. but they figured they could do a fork, invest nothing, and dump all their free coins on others who don't know any better.  
and better yet, name it "Bitcoin cash" and rip off the same icon to try and trick/confuse new investors so they don't know which is which, or that they're totally separate cryptos. 
The whole thing smelled like shit from the very beginning 
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:58:09
Are you serious? lol look at a Bitcoin chart. Their decisions did what exactly? 
If you're seriously saying that a rushed and sloppy solution would be better for Bitcoin simply because you want to gobble up as much money in a matter of a couple weeks as you possibly can, then honestly, I hope you sold BTC and won't be back. Because that's so absurd I don't even know what to say 
In 1 year we skyrocket from being some underground crypto project to being a 15 thousand dollar asset with futures trading, tons of news exposure, and incredible widespread acceptance and desire to own the coin. 
Yet, according to you, the developers *suck* 
Ooooookay whatever you say 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:54:08
You don't go all in all at once. You dollar cost average your way in. Don't be greedy/dumb 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:05:48
If this same formula is applied to 2016 data would it have predicted a rise over 19k in 2017? Would it have even predicted 10k in 2017? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:30:45
Don't leave your coins on exchange. Put them on a wallet where you have the key words to restore it if it's lost/broken/etc. 
Never use a hardware wallet from a source like eBay or anywhere where it doesn't come STRAIGHT from that company. There are scam devices, they look like the real thing, but the scammers already have the seed words and steal your money once you deposit. 
Buy a trezor FROM trezor, move your coins off of the exchange jn case the exchange gets hacked or goes down. Always test your transactions with a small amount first before sending a lot of money. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:59:04
I'm not taking it personal, anyone who wants bcash- fine with me, it's no skin off my nose. I just appreciate people seeing it how you do, because I got to sell my free scam coins for several thousand dollars each. Pretty sweet deal for me, horrible deal for whoever paid 3k for each of my coins lol 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:25:41
They probably have the seed already. Like those nano ledger scams with the scratch off seed words 
I would never ever ever use any device that didn't come straight from that company 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:48:30
Never going to 20k again? lol that's good. I think you should watch some videos on TA. 
We'll revisit this, trust me 
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:07:18
The point is it has unique traits that give it value as a currency

Well first of all they did it suddenly without warning, locked me from selling my BCH all I was allowed to do was buy, also pumped the price up 100% higher than everywhere else and ripped people the fuck off for 6k+ when the true price was 3k 
Don't see a problem? Really? Shill. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:03:47
Solution: HODL ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:29:58
I bought in for 500 and still haven't sold... I wouldn't say "no one" 
Some of us really couldn't contain our excitement for BTC

It's also pretty clear they are using the network traffic they have to rip people off. The price is ALWAYS higher on CB than anywhere else I see, and apparently now they are under paying when you sell on top of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:11:55
There are actually plenty of people confusing this for Bitcoin. So it's like mcdowells making their building LOOK like a McDonald's so that anyone who isn't Mcdonalds savy wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Then they sell you a fake Big Mac and you only realize after you bite into it that you were tricked the whole time. 
There's a lot of just average everyday people who have never bought any crypto who are just now looking to get some Bitcoin. And they are being tricked 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:11:45
What about your personal portfolio, are YOU invested in Bitcoin?
That's the right way to ask about this right? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:27
They have lost my business, price manipulation by an exchange? What the fuck. 
They really need to be investigated, if I was one who paid 8k for a BCH I would probably be checking to see if I had grounds to sue

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:35:31
Just because you can earn money by making good investments doesn't mean it's fair to dilute the fuck out of the money supply. 
You like stocks, so this should make sense to you. You buy stock in a company then they come out and say they're issuing new shares, diluting your investment. You get pissed. 
But when the government does it to your money directly, you just lube up, bend over, and take it??
Bitcoin is a currency and not a stock, a currency that you will be able to invest the same way once it's mainstream. There's no reason for us to be getting inflated every day just to invest in stocks.  
And If you want to compare returns on investment between bitcoins and stocks, yeah let's do that and see who wins. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:46:53
Do you still have a Bitcoin left? Or was that all of them 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:10:29

I'd trim some at some point but I think I'll always keep some Bitcoin. I'd sell off all my other investments before Bitcoin if I had to do that 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:02:13

@_date: 2017-12-11 22:11:50
I'm not sure coinbase is weird, I would tell you to reach out to support buuuut as we all know there are way too many users joining for them to keep up. Hopefully soon they can scale their support employee numbers so that we can hear back from them every now and then 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:08:30

A few months ago, someone at my work who is very inexperienced at investing told me he wanted to buy some Bitcoin. He wanted my advice as to where he could buy it and what price he should buy at. 
Not wanting to fuck up this poor guys life I just told him I couldn't say what the right price was but to only buy in when Bitcoin has been relatively stable for a couple weeks. Buy when it's boring again. 
My dude just made his first buy this week, plans to DCA in over the next month or so.

I think you're missing the point, it is meant to be a decentralized wealth storage. If you really look into how centralized and inflationary currencies work... If you really think about it, how you in a nutshell invest time and effort in exchange for notes which dictate the value of your time/effort, yet these notes are being printed off as fast as the central bank chooses to print them... You start to see the value and potential in having wealth storage in a decentralized, deflationary currency system.

It was also a bubble at 1000 again this year, and went to 9,500+ without popping, see what I mean? This is a new animal, no one can tell us when the next pop is, for all we know this could run way way more before any kind of pullback. 
That's why I'm going to ride it out and just add big if there is a pop, just like when it crashed off of 1000 back when.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:41:15

I have hopes that over time, these things will resolve themselves. Bitcoin has had larger problems in the past, but now that it's becoming legitimized as an actual world currency, I think we are well on our way. Sure, there will be more hiccups, but someone with a large holding of Bitcoin- what's the worst he can do, dump coins and bring the price down a bit? It will rebound as it has before. It's just the growing pains, we need these large holders to take some profits so that those coins get distributed amongst other holders with plans to ride those coins to a higher profit. As those get distributed, the value becomes less volatile, and more will view it as a stable form of equity.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:20:19
Which is why I called it a bubble. Point is, today's bubble can so easily be the "I wish I had bought in" price in a matter of a few years when you're talking about a powerful innovation.

That's assuming you know this will pop, and not just that, but when and where- what if this goes to 30k then the "pop" takes us to 15k? 
All I know is, I've been in for YEARS, been told the whole time "it's going to crash" and everytime it goes up "it's a bubble". People were calling bubble at $600-$1000. if I listened to those people and waited for the "pop" I would have missed out on SO many amazing and life changing gains

Would it be fair to say he could also be responsible for SAVING twice as many lives by providing an outlet for people to get legitimate drugs rather than resorting to just trusting the junkie down the road and injecting themselves with whatever it was he handed them? 
I mean drug addicts are going to get high, there's really no stopping it- it's not like they would be sober citizens without SR being around. So I would argue an avenue to acquire exactly what they wanted, rather than getting some fentanyl laced stuff that would kill them, or some research chemical that could cause psychosis- might have actually saved some people from overdosing 
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:34:22
what are the odds that an illiquid, hardly touched crypto has 50000 people in one country paying all of their taxes in it? Pretty sure that's a very very very low risk possibility at the moment. And for a regime in the current state they are in, that's not even a risk worth considering... They've got much bigger problems 
?? it isn't irrelevant, the less liquid something is, the easier it is to manipulate. Look at penny stocks for example. Super easy to manipulate. But manipulating Apple stock? That takes an incredible amount of capital to do. 
Unregulated market on top of it. Imagine what a crooked hedge fund could do with a penny stock if the market was a total unregulated free for all. We've seen this in cryptos how many times? Whales can manipulate, create fake volume, and get a bunch of idiots to FOMO money right into their wallet. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:02:33
What's your point? That manipulation wouldn't happen just because the stock market is bigger? That's absurd. If Goldman Sachs / JP and others will bash companies with 10-15 billion market caps just to make a low entry, they'll sure as hell do it with crypto at several hundred billion. And they do trade Bitcoin now, that's a fact. 
Get that into your head. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:42:26
Hahahah look at you try to worm your way out of the discussion you got absolutely fucking embarrassed on. Hahahahaha what a fucking twat you are 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:58:16
Big boys like the ones you see in the news taking an optimistic tone now. No way they will buy bitcoins at your sale price, they want you to panic and donate them to their hedge funds. 
Check out the trends where investment banks like Goldman rate stocks as sells and claim they are hot garbage, then pick up all the shares the scared people are dumping. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc are all now in the Bitcoin game. Famous manipulators, they don't even care to hide it. I think it was Jamie dimon of JP who once said something along the lines of go ahead and fine me for market manipulation, I already profited more than the fine will be 
So what they do is load up bitcoins nice and steady, then dump them all in a market sell. When small guys like us see multi millions in bitcoins being sold, taking out all the bids like lightning, we get scared and sell. They liquidate your futures contracts, then close theirs out profit on the downside and use those profits to accumulate more BTC. 
There's going to be an ongoing effort to rebalance the bitcoins into their accounts. You don't get to invest in something before wall st cuts off their own chunk, but you did with Bitcoin. That's pissed them off, they want your coins. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:17:38

All in saying is it takes a transaction to put a price point on a chart, doesn't matter who buys or sells
And you said he'd have to sell not buy...which first of all can't happen because the sale order for 1 million would sit at the bottom of the orderbook, but even if it were possible, why would he have to be on the selling side of the trade?

It's actually hilarious that you think a world class bank sets up a trading desk for something then just casually trade it during lunch for fun. No you dumbass, when these banks trade something like this they milk it for all they can, and yeah they could easily be making billions off these swings with their type of money.

To me it's more about the fact that you've secured 1 of the limited amount of coins and you have that for as long as you hold.

@_date: 2018-02-15 19:21:25
Bitcoin is called Bitcoin because it's Bitcoin. Bcash just ripped off the code and changed the block size, why in the world would a copy cat of the original take the originals name? That doesn't make sense

Well my point is even if something is way over valued all that matters is that they can sell it at the price it's being valued at, no matter what the valuation is. Fair point about fees, I would think they would tack that on for payments in cryptos to include the cost of fees, but with the state their economy is in...maybe they just don't care about eating the fees themselves lol 
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:56:42
Why are you assuming they're holding everything? You just sell it as soon as you're paid in them. I'd accept crypto as well, $100 worth of doge is $100.

Well it actually does look like it's going up from here huuuge volume on 6k bounce, 3 white soldiers on daily chart following it, typical signs of reversal. You can feel the tone of the news start to shift which almost always means the rich are ready to let it go up. We can see the biggest whales have simply added massive amounts of BTC to their wallets. they'll be looking for an ATH in my opinion, the ultra rich almost never lose.

Lol. This is such a flawed way of thinking. The haircut is 40 bucks, what difference is it what you pay in? I can give you 40 USD or I can give you 40 worth in Bitcoin and use my 40 usd to replace the Bitcoin I sent. 
People always assume because you hold Bitcoin you can't make transactions with it. That's so dumb. If I have $100 for groceries why couldn't I just convert that to BTC and spend it that way? What difference does it make to the person spending it? 
And furthermore, what difference does it make to a vendor? If you want to pay me in BTC and I want USD sure I'll take the BTC and just convert it. Who cares.

@_date: 2018-03-16 04:29:32
Lol someone's mad. Listen you dumb virgin. Selling on the open market knocks out buy orders, takes out stop losses, creates a downward pull. Buying a mass amount on the open market creates a push from the market as sell walls get taken out and momentum is sparked. A large seller makes less than their equity value because they knocked the price down with their dump, a big buyer pays more for his order as he takes out sell walls and raises the price. 
On a private market the large buyer and large seller can make the exchange at the market price and both save money. Win win. 
Is that simple enough for your little mind? Or do I need to ELI5 again? 
Now go back to your basement you dumbass. Learn how markets work as a basic level before talking shit, you just made yourself look like the biggest fucking retard hahahahaha

It makes sense with Bitcoin because the ecosystem is totally in the power of the community, i.e. It's decentralized 
Microsoft is a centralized corporate entity with a leader (bill gates) who is an identifiable and living person

Holding through a loss and adding more isn't something a person with the mentality "I'll never lose money" is going to do. Wait until your emotions start kicking in as you watch your $ value go down. People who expect to never lose money are at the heart of the panic when they start to lose money.

Because who wouldn't kill themselves after only multiplying their money x8 in 1 year right?? Yeah, it really sucks and Bitcoin must be dead. Those returns just aren't good enough!!!!! 
I love how people focus on the loss of 70% and completely ignore the fact that it went up almost 2000% in less than a year first. It's an interesting facet of human psychology, I have to admit. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:08:52
If a haircut is 40 bucks why would I give you any more or any less than 40 bucks worth of BTC? That's the current value, you can sell your BTC immediately for that exact price, it's the fair price to charge. same with any other commodity, like gold for example. You get what the current price is because you can turn around and sell for that price. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:53:25
This is tiny brained thinking. Who says there's a blood contract for BTC that says if you buy you have to HODL for life? I don't remember signing it. 
But yeah all this time I thought vendors were going to accept BTC transactions and just swap the BTC for fiat right away so that the volatility doesn't matter at all whatsoever 
But it's good that I found out about this binding contract to HODL every satoshi you ever receive, this whole time I thought people were allowed to sell their bitcoins 
Thanks for the info!!!  
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:21:27
Thinking it's going to double bottom at close to February's lows. Look for the soldier candles. 
There's no need to be the first to buy, the upside is so big don't get all greedy and shit over a few %. Watch for the big volume to pick this up on double bottom, after that I think it starts another uptrend again. 
Don't quote me bro. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:15:31
You wanna see a bubble? Even 3% tax haven accounts allocated into Bitcoin (even if just for a hedge in case of economic disaster) would send Bitcoin over a million dollars.

You're asking for advice then when people with years of experience say something you act like a smart ass kid who knows it all, it's all over the thread. Now you've been caught in a loop absent logic where you said you won't sell your investment when it's high, which means the only logical explanation is that you'll panic sell low, now you want "proof" that you directly said that 
"I want some of that pie" 
"Ok- Would you rather have pumpkin pie or cherry pie? "
"Well I'm not taking pumpkin pie" 
"Oh ok, so here's some cherry pie then!"
"Where the fuck did I say I want cherry pie? Link to where I said that" 
This is the most autistic conversation I've had to have with someone in a long time. Jesus Christ. 
I don't give a fuck when you sell. I won't care when you lose money.

People poke fun of this but this is serious. The unbanked and forgotten is an absolutely massive demographic who need financial services. It's time to stop leaving most of the world to suffer in poverty without any options for banking. 
Now we can drop a $20 android or cheap PC and a solar panel in a village, and they have an entire banking system. Look at sentinel chain, they are looking to give the poor a way to take out loans by using their livestock as collateral. One day farmers who need a loan to start a crop will have a way to do so and grow their business, much like the business start ups of the first world. Financial services like this are a huge essential in getting a large portion of humanity out of dire circumstances...

Can confirm. Gender is not a hang up in tech, at all. So few women are interested in the tech field, the ones who aggressively try to climb the ladder do much better than the men, judging from what I've seen during my career in the industry. More women should be looking at the tech industry, seriously

Lol no one is claiming credit for creating Bitcoin here, that's quite a reach there 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:27:20
Like is anyone surprised bcash will turn out to be an elaborate scam for him to duplicate his BTC for him to cash out without ever having to sell a single real BTC? From day 1 I knew what this shit was all about. 
Solving a "problem" that already has an incoming solution by air dropping yourself a bunch of free coins then telling everyone else to buy them from you, the most obvious scam I've ever seen in crypto, even ahead of Bitconnect 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:08:02
If this was me though I'd hide my seed words and smash my Trezor right in front of her. Whoooooops sorry babes I guess it's gone forever now 
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:10:16
I have multiple thousand % ROI so yeah I do know what I'm doing, keep being salty and jealous you didn't have the common sense to buy :) 
And enjoy your 0 hedge strategy I'm sure that will work out GREAT for you lmao 
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:42:13
Oh, family member stranded in foreign county? Yeah, go ahead and use those services you talk about... See what an ATM does for you 
Bitcoin, in that case, would be the difference between them sleeping on the streets, or having a bed and food. Your bank will leave them fucked for several days.
 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:38:41
Yeah you said that already and exactly the point. the idea is to sell high. And buy low. Idk why you're proud to do the opposite 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:31:44
This is how you get rekt. Don't believe me now, you will late. GL 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:58:20
Yeah sorry I should have specified OP of the comment, which I didn't even realize was you lol, that was confusing on my part. My b 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:30:17
"I'll just double my money real quick guys, nbd" 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:11:23
you said you wouldn't sell high which is the entire point of investing kid. Do you know what deductive logic means? If you aren't going to sell high, what's the other option? This is fucking common sense lol 
more or less your statement "I won't lose money" 99% of the time translates to "I'm gonna panic sell low" anyways 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:03:08
Libertarians typically don't give a fuck what you do but that also applies to not forcing people to pay for other people's abortions. Why should I go to work and pay you my hard earned money so you can go have an abortion that has nothing to do with me or my decisions?  
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:27:46
I've been in crypto since 2013 "kid" and maybe you should learn the difference between private and public market sales before you go acting like you what the fuck you're talking about. Moron lol 
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:51:24
My comment called out the mentally unstable guy generalizing anyone with a libertarian point of view as a nazi that is likely to commit a genocide. That's just insane. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:22:21
Good luck saying that you'll sell high? What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:34:23
That would be the exact opposite of what was stated by OP 
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:50:40
Because it doesn't make any sense you fucking dumbass. he's asking me to support the point of an entirely different user when i wasn't even involved in that discussion. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:05:39
This is so ignorant and stupid I don't even know where to begin. Holy shit lmao. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:05:48
Huh? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:48:47
And yeah, every sane business also locks their customers in the restaurant to make sure they don't dine and dash! I hear they'll start handcuffing people to the tables. 0 confirmation Bitcoin transactions are definitely their greatest risk! 
Hahahah your statement is so dumb I think I lost some brain cells 
@_date: 2018-07-28 23:21:13
LOL duude my bad! I thought you were calling ME cringeworthy 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:45:51
Did you read my comment before replying to me? The statement I quoted says he exact opposite of the example you gave me 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:22:28
'More good debt is worse than less bad debt'
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:08:44
My opinion? yeah it is. But So is USD, gold, jewls, fucking ANYTHING with value. 
Anyone claiming BTC should be "shut down" because of laundering should be consistent and also take the position that we should shut down every business in the US because some of them can be used to launder money. It's just stupid. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:01:38
Exactly, so when they buy on the open exchange it's not an effort to accumulate, but a signal to them lemmings that our overlords are ready for the run...
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:17:13
What's "Bitcoin core"? I only know of Bitcoin. Is it another shitcoin fork trying to steal the name? Those are scams 
@_date: 2018-04-19 22:19:19
*woosh* 
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:58:35
lol way to miss the point and get *extra extra* salty 
Who shat in your cereal this morning? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:28:51
Easy to say "just get along" but the truth of the matter is some dickhead came in and created his own coin, tried to claim it's the "real" Bitcoin, plagiarized the name, and works round the clock efforts trying to confuse new investors and trick them into buying his coin 
Pretty malicious and shitty if you ask me. No one has a problem with someone making their own crypto, it's the shady ass underhanded and scammy tactics we have issues with 
If roger called it cashcoin or something, I wouldn't give a fuck. But not only did he name it after Bitcoin, he tries to say that Bitcoin isn't the real Bitcoin anymore. Just real scummy. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:31:36
Lol what? Roger directly made it a battle when he tried to steal the name and lie to all new investors that his coin was now the "real" Bitcoin. 
Have a backbone and stand up against people doing shady things like this. He's free to make a coin and sell it to people, but trying to trick people and steal name recognition is a fucking shit thing to do whether you're talking about crypto, or ANY other industry. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:12:42
Logarithmic chart says so.... So yeah, maths back up that theory. The higher our market cap gets, the loss volatile things will become 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:15:21
...what? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:30:48
I mean in reference to your first sentence, asking why OP had that belief- I know I get the same belief as him from looking at the log chart
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:29:24
Once again trying to scam new investors and trick them into buying his shitcoin. Fuck that guy. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:05:30
lol that's hilarious. "Our money is backed by gold. Oh now our money is backed by oil. Oh now... Nevermind" 
All it takes is one peek at the inflation rates and some common sense to know we didn't suddenly magically find and extract a fucking massive vault of oil to "back our dollars with", the printing from 2010 on out is absolutely insane. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:14:38
there is literally mathematical support to this theory, that the higher our price gets the loss volatile it becomes....See logarithmic charting.  
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:00:28
Which is why I said I don't agree with what he's saying 
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:58:36
I don't agree with what the dude is saying but he means investing in Bitcoin is like giving your money away 
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:34:35
Which one was there first and which one came in later, stole the name, tried to trick people into thinking theirs was the real original one? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:11:06
Freedom and lawlessness/scamming are not the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:33:08
And I would bet my left nut Venezuelans are some of the most hostile towards petro shitcoin out of everyone. I mean the same group of people launching the ICO have already scammed the fuck out of them. 
That'd be like the savedroid guy coming back and saying he's launching another ICO, and the same people who got scammed the first time buying his tokens again lol 
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:52:18
This is what's usually referred to in society as a "joke"
A strange phenomena indeed

Hey, it's me, ur brother 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:55:30
If I see one more person compare this bear market to the last one.... do these people realize what the last bear market was based around? Full implosion. Massive amounts of people got mt goxed and rekt immediately. Then impending fear of those coins being dumped. Then constant fear about Chinese government due to the % of mining taking place in China. This was before major companies even paid any kind of attention to BTC too, and when I'd see people speculating that US government itself could make BTC illegal because of all the Silk Road shit. That was the most depressing time I've ever been through with Bitcoin. 
Does nobody realize the strides Bitcoin has made (and I'm not even talking about price)? If you would have told me back when I first bought that I'd be seeing my stock broker talking about Bitcoin one day, I would have gone six to midnight. It's amazing how accepting and interested many of the large players are, how many of them have changed their attitude towards Bitcoin. 
BINANCE SURPASSED DEUTSCHE BANK IN REVENUE. Of course they are interested. 
The market is what it is. We could still go down more from here, there's been no convincing bounce or support to say otherwise yet. But by the time it finds bottom, there's going to be more professional money involved, and therefore less volatility- they aren't reckless. When smart money is trading against smart money, the panic and euphoria are less and less extreme than when it is a bunch of retail idiots and computer nerds controlling a large portion of the market.
Every bull/bear cycle the smart players will accumulate a higher % of the market and therefore the highs and the lows will get less and less extreme until the market is pretty boring and stable. Then you can see full blown adoption, once it stabilizes. And by the time we get there, the world will be ready, and so will the network. 
   
But then again I don't know what im taking about either to be honest, I'm just a random guy on the Internet

I'll take an improved country over someone who just wants to nurture my feelings but we all have different priorities 
Do you know what business failure % is and the rate at which even the most successful businessmen fail? Apparently not at all lol 
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:48:27
Is the $10 really worth the risk lol 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:25:19
Lmao nice calculation there Sherlock 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:22:06
I mean if I was a business I would definitely want to associate myself with the guys that cloned BTC and tried to mislead people into thinking my clone had the consensus to be the real BTC, then those guys have a big fight and self destruct their own original scam? 
Sign me up man ive never been interested in crypto but I am now /s
