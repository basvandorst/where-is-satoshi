The app looks great, and more importantly the marketing of it is very attractive as a consumer.
The thing I notice right away, though, is that you’re rounding the value of each crypto significantly. This is a horrible design choice that makes the app, for me, much less useful for tracking smaller cryptos. I hope you’ll reconsider this choice in an update.

That’d be great! I’d appreciate it if you made a Reddit post announcement when you start offering this, hopefully soon :)

What really sucks is that you could just be a normal Redditor too, but the cost of manufacturing or purchasing Reddit accounts is so low that small companies can easily use them to astroturf. I hope you’re real, but I had to at least point it out.

Satire, downvoters. It’s doesn’t always need a ‘/s’

If you really want cheap transaction fees, just buy from a SegWit deployed exchange to a SegWit address like Electrum for cold storage HODLing.
Much, much lower transaction fees.

On top of what others have said, there are also *massive* transaction fees and very little anonymity.

Pardon my disregard for the severity of the OP’s very real and serious disease, but...
This entire thread is cancer.

Probably the United States. The combination of a lack of government-funded healthcare, massive overcharging and lack of price transparency in hospitals, and the relatively small number of doctors because of the unreasonably high cost of medical school and the predatory terms of student loans cause a ridiculously high cost for necessary healthcare needed to survive.
More controversially, that hypothetical free healthcare is impractical in the United States compared to other countries, as the political system and climate make true tax increases on companies and the wealthy nearly impossible. Those factors, overspending on defense, and large national debt make funding a NHS equivalent very difficult, if one could even be created due to insurance lobbying, the high influence of the rich through campaign contributions, and a general anti-socialism sentiment.
Please don’t downvote brigade me Reddit, just tell me if I got something wrong.

You both make valid points, r/iamverysmart

I have to say, it is very suspicious that a 3-week old Reddit account is making an advertisement-like comment in response to a company. This could just be a coincidence, but EA’s recent Reddit BS has made me very suspicious of this. 
Edit: Gotta love having all your comments downvoted in a thread.

All those poor alcoholics who bought right before bitcoin plummeted from $1200, all the way down to $600. Won’t people ever learn that bitcoin is just a bubble?! [Don’t you feel silly ]( /s
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:46:48
I hope we can get volatility to decrease eventually, so that BTC can be more useable as a currency.

I wish I got in under 10K.

So... you ended up being pretty much right already.

Good bot. This is one of the most basic rules of the English language.
