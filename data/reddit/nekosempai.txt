I know. I just get overly defensive when people mention it, in a perceived negative way. Misunderstanding. My apologies. I mentioned booze because I feel like if he drank normally. It wouldn't even have been mentioned as a factor into his judgment. Which is what I'm taking that you are implying its the weed smoke that made him come up with these ideas. Which that implication to me means his statement is thus less creditable since he smokes weed.

Man, just because I don't praise bitcoin. I get down voted. We have to get away from tribalism. I love bitcoin, but there are better cryptocurrency's out there. That scale higher than bitcoin. That's not a bad thing.

Why would that make any difference? Marijuana doesn't cloud judgment like booze.

Cryptocurrency is cheaper with things like nano and iota to name a couple. Litecoin fee's are so tiny, that it might as well be free. Bitcoin a better store of value for potential increases. Bitcoin fees are kind of shitty.

Solid proof of a bull run here, if I've ever seen one.

If my bitcoin was worth a million, I'd be crazy not to trade. I'm all for advancing teq, but I'd have to be crazy not too.

Bitcoin is better for store of value. Imho. Oh great thumbs down for having an opinion.
