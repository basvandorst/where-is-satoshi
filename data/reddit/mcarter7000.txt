Why do you call it a shitcoin?

Are you saying you think that BTC will be able to be used by anyone anytime as quickly and easily as a credit card or touchless payment?

I don't think it's necessary that only one coin be "the one" and that everything else is a shitcoin.
You say no "Bitcoin" will compete with credit cards and apple pay but Nano is literally just as fast as those.  And it has lower fees.  A lot lower.  Vendors might eat it up voraciously for that.  Every sale they make with it over credit cards nets them something like 4% more money.  That huge especially in proportional to profit.  Nano would thereby have nodes all over the world quickly.
Are you saying that you think Bitcoin could "code in" Nano's capabilities into Bitcoin?  What you write is a little unclear.
Not actually trying to argue for NANO, particularly, just trying to get it clear what objections people have to it are.  I'm afraid I'm not yet convinced that there is something wrong with it.  Still think the speed, cost, energy consumption are game-changing.

Of course it's premined.  That would be bad if it was Bitcoin but it's a completely different tech.  The faucet distributed them all over the world, particularly to 3rd world countries.  Why do you say it's centralized?  My understanding is that it's meant for everyone using it to be a node, so I would think that would make it extremely decentralized.
Genuinely interested in hearing the argument for why it's bad.  Seems like it's the only coin that might ever be able to compete with credit cards and touchess payments like Apple Pay.

No.  Deliberately being obtuse?

If NANO is good it's extremely exciting not as an alternative to BTC but as a complement.  I want to see cryptocurrencies actually be used for everyday payments.  Like credit cards, touchess payments (e.g. Apple Pay) etc are.  As far as I know, there is nothing else out there that even theoretically affords that capability.  It also seems like it's practically infinitely scalable, as every payment processor will be a node.
Please let me know where I'm wrong.  I'd be really interested in hearing what might be wrong with it as well as what alternative means there might be for providing this capability.

So you will be able to walk up to anyone and just send them money in seconds without knowing anything except an address or having a touchless reader.  I thought LN requires creating a channel and various things like that.

Don't you have to create a channel with them first?  What about fees?
