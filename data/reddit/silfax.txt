Nice. I'd suggest you align and center the three buttons (tweet/share/tip) under the get started button or at the bottom, they look a little messy as they are at the moment.
There are a lot of bitcoin introductory sites - it would be great somehow to be able to provide all the definitive answers people need in one place, but decentralized systems have PR problems. :)
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:46:11
I would imagine it would go into a multisig address controlled in part by both of them, so they would both have to agree to return the deposits to themselves and each other.
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:45:06
I'll take a look! Thanks @_date: 2014-04-27 03:57:11
Thanks for the quick fix guys.

Awesome. Thanks for the support and congratulations, @_date: 2014-10-27 18:51:54
Mod on here:
we push very hard to make sure that scams don't happen. When you just send someone money, you are going against the very core of Bitcoin, which should be a trustless system.
Here are a couple major things you should be doing whenever transacting without someone you don't know.
2. Use escrow! We provide an insured escrow system built-in (read the sidebar), or at very least use multi-sig.
1. Look at the account history of the person - in this case, the person you hired has been consistently downvoted.
It's unfortunate that happened, but you can't expect just sending money to a random user to go well.
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:16:01
I have to give a plug for  which is a slightly different model than you described, but a very interesting one that people are starting to use.
You essentially put a global price on a widget, and people start contributing, and once it reaches that crowdfunded level, the song is permanently released to the world (you can of course include as many formats/extra info as you like!
Consider using it to release a bonus track, or something along those lines.
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:25:41
The main problem with this system is that placing/removing an order costs a fee to broadcast, making bots and automated arbitrage difficult to pull off profitably.
But beyond that, it seems a great idea, and it might be worth it to avoid misplaced trust.
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:50:47
Bots keep the markets healthy, close spreads and ensure arbitrage is done seamlessly to avoid having one exchange much higher than another.
Also most large players will avoid a market if it doesn't have the above elements, so you'll lose a lot of liquidity in any case.
@_date: 2013-12-30 11:33:29
What he means is, if someone obtains everyone's private keys, then there is no way to tell (even if the blockchain is reverted) who the bitcoin belongs to. It only 'belongs' to you if you have the private key, but if an attacker or the public gets access to these keys, there's no way to revert to them not knowing them.
@_date: 2013-07-01 12:49:11
Yep, the plan was to use envelops like [these]( and put some extra paper for padding inside.
And definitely gloves. We all want clean coins! I sent a message to Casascius in terms of individual cases, we'll see what he says.
Yes, I sent the message out to most people, but then realized I wasn't certain about getting those shipped, so stopped. Sorry.
What might be useful though is a skype chat, so that I can just send messages once rather than pasting it into 10 different reddit messages...
@_date: 2013-03-13 16:34:43
I'm thinking of starting out with Bitcoin - does it make more sense to store the bitcoin (is that how you say the plural?) on my computer or on a site like coinbase? Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:46:35
"In other words, wallet addresses should only be used once"
Well, though this is mostly true, it's that they should send once. You can send a million transactions to an address, and it will be just as secure, until you send something from the address, and then the public key is exposed.
But something on a paper for newbies? Not sure if it's necessary.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:10:35
Well it would take some time, but ideally you'd just put a string at the end of the puzzle solution (like you are doing for your site, but a slightly more secure one, like a password). Then they would have to generate each sudoku solution for any possible string at the end, which would be essentially infeasible.
@_date: 2013-07-15 21:47:57
Cool - it's a little extra to ship there, so it's 2.35/coin, like it says up in the OP. How many are you interested in? If you get 3+, I can give you a discount, as shipping does cost more/weight, but the majority is the envelop+postage+overhead etc.
@_date: 2013-07-16 06:23:33
Once you send the payment, please sign a message containing your mailing address with the address you sent the payment with.
@_date: 2013-06-28 18:32:50
Yes, 4.36. Once I determine the exactly weight of the packages, I might give a small amount back, but for only 2, I don't think it will be much.
If you are buying 4+, then there probably would be a discount.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:41:48
right, but that's in no way automated, and would still require a third party to redirect funds. I believe he misunderstood the question, because of course you can make a transaction that sends to multiple places (blockchain.info wallet for example does this easily). The interesting part is automating this process.
If you are highly concerned about security for a specific project, I can license the code to you like I did for the GB I mentioned above.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:43:23
Done. Now the bitcoin logo is also a link to weusecoins.com, which has the animation and bunch of info. Maybe I can get funding via some sort of feature request system?
@_date: 2013-06-30 13:08:38
I did, and yes. One guy suggested to ask Casascius himself, so I'm waiting to hear back from him.
@_date: 2013-08-27 15:38:32
Sorry, can you clarify what you mean by dogfood? Also yes, I would be willing to open-source it, maybe I'll set up a widget to release the code.
@_date: 2013-07-13 18:45:10
Cool. There was a guy organizing a US group buy, but his prices (for US) were much higher than mine, and I'm shipping from the EU! :D The payment address is up, so I'll confirm when I receive payment.
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:04:28
They are in 20 coin batches, and it's directly from Casascius. He's come out with a 2013 batch.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:52:10
Right, but then combining is the issue. At some point one would have to trust the other to hand over the correct half of the secret.
@_date: 2013-07-31 23:20:40
My pleasure, so happy to hear you got it. Intact and everything?

Thanks for your business.
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:32:44
Yeah, he's waiting for everyone to receive I believe before loading them up. None of them have been loaded yet - I can check with him to see when he's loading them if you'd like.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:17:32
Yes. I managed to buy some at $48, but they still haven't been delivered yet. Bank transfered $48.
@_date: 2013-07-01 09:11:26
sorry, where is CDN? I'm already shipping to the USA + Australia + a couple places in Europe, so I might be able to fit you in if you're willing to pay a premium. All of the coins are sold out of this round, but if you want to pay extra, I can see if someone else will relinquish their coin to you. (if you pay 2.8 or something around there)
@_date: 2013-07-26 01:41:09
From skype chat: 
Received! Image:  I should be able to get them shipped out by tomorrow or the next day, and delivery, if everything goes according to plan, should be a couple days after that.
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:52:34
Okay, thanks. Do you also keep hold of your bitcoin in a bunch of places? It seems like you have a fair amount! I don't suppose you would like to test your bot out on me while I wait for my coinbase account to get verified? ;D
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:28:06

Try it out, there may still be bugs.
@_date: 2013-10-09 21:20:55
Yeah, from the RSA key you posted, that's just a way that GLBSE or security owners would identify you - it's actually the owner of the exchange that holds your coins. Unless you can get in contact with him somehow, I'm sorry to say that your coins may be lost.

It's written in Python on Google Appengine, so that I don't have to pay to host it myself - and it uses some blockchain features to help with stuff.
It's not actually open source at the moment, as I've got a couple sites that are using my paid version (on the site that I showed above, I charge 1mbtc per transaction), but if you are interested in using it on a larger scale, I'd be willing to send you the code and everything (without the 1mbtc fees) for a smallish license fee - that's what I did for another client who wanted his own secure instance.
It also has the capability to send you an email on new payments if you like that.
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:32:16
Okay, I sent him a message. Once he replies, I'll change the address in the OP.
EDIT: Okay, he's posted an address, and it's updated. Please confirm by sending your btc to that address and then signing a message with the address you would like to receive at.
@_date: 2013-06-28 17:40:42
Okay, I marked down two coins for you, will confirm upon receipt of bitcoins + signed message.
@_date: 2013-09-15 19:14:05
As a little bit of friendly competition to Bitcoinstarter, I'm the dev who wrote that widget from the post above.
The goal of the widget is to make it really simple to, in your own website, allow a huge group to each contribute a small amount to unlock some content. It's much more lightweight than bitcoinstarter, which (seems to me) to be built on more of a model of pay to fund the production of something, rather than the release of something.
If you want to give it a go, consider releasing one (bonus) song off the album through unlockwithbitcoin.com, in addition to whatever other method you use to sell the rest. Then once a certain amount is raised, the song will be released permanently.
Otherwise, if not enough is raised, the btc is refunded. Let me know if you have questions, and congrats with the new album!
@_date: 2013-06-28 19:55:54
Hey - just double checking that you are still interested? Otherwise I might have to give away the slot.

Hey! If there's enough interest, I will definitely do another. How many would you get? (the more you are interested in, the faster we could get the 20 required) I've already got another three people who are interested. I guess I can post another thread, see whether interest has increased.
@_date: 2013-06-28 18:57:24
Hmm... Well it would be difficult to actually carve a bitcoin address in there.
One idea that came to me was to use the serial number of the coin along with some salt to generate a brain wallet, and then it would effectively be a bitcoin... but not sure beyond that.
@_date: 2013-07-02 15:14:36
He hasn't responded... I don't know how got in contact with him so quickly - maybe he can try again.
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:33:23
I've already gotten most people's mailing addresses, you can wait to send it to me until we get the full number of coins if you wish though! Can I get your skype name for a group chat for announcements/notices? Thanks.
@_date: 2013-06-28 19:27:39
Okay, I marked down a coin for you, will confirm upon receipt of bitcoins + signed message.
@_date: 2013-06-28 15:00:01
Nope, that's it! I just need to verify the addresses so that nobody would be able to pretend that someone else's payment was their own.
The QT client (afaik) will send from any your addresses that have been paid to. One foolproof way is to just send the btc, and then check the transaction out on blockchain, which will show all the addresses that were used. You can then select any of those to sign the message from.
@_date: 2013-05-24 05:03:19
The small version? Hmm... there may be an issue if you use it on the same page as a different large version, but by itself should be absolutely fine. If you can specify, that would be helpful. The small version seems a lot more useful, can just be tucked away wherever needed.
@_date: 2013-07-10 09:31:33
This would have been perfect for @_date: 2013-04-24 00:23:03
Yes. As long as you don't ever let the ubuntu installation see the light of day, (i.e. connect it to the internet) there is no way that anyone could get access to the public key stored in it. You just want to make sure that you also write this key down somewhere, just in case the CD breaks or something silly like that.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:43:03
Yeah, there doesn't seem to be a really easy way with blockchain.info to get the number of tippers. Like someone posted before, it would be a trivial feature to add to the API though if it were added. Thanks for the support - maybe add it to the original post for visibility?

@_date: 2013-04-18 17:19:01
Hey! Still looking through, but a couple minor things...
On your main purchasing page, it says "Withdrawl" as opposed to the correct "Withdrawal".
When some illegal characters are entered into your fields ("/') etc, you show a "You are not allowed to visit this page" message, as opposed to a more helpful "You can't have these characters in your email address" or something like that.
Still looking for more serious issues, but looks like a good site - hope it works well for you!
@_date: 2013-07-16 16:00:41
A second one was actually organized - obviously the first buy has priority - Casascius said that tomorrow (Wednesday) is when he makes another large batch, so hopefully the long wait will be over.
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:20:38
He charges 1btc for the silver, the manufacturing, the novelty, I suppose.
The point of the group buy is that you end up paying an extra btc per coin if you buy in singles rather than in a set.
@_date: 2013-08-15 11:44:36
I agree with this is indeed circumstantial. If wanted to scam people, he would have done it long ago, for example when I trusted with with 40+ btc. This (which seems to have gotten only a couple of dollars so far) would definitely not be worth his time and reputation. I have no relation to him, other than I've gotten to know him through I'm willing to bet a lot that he's not trying to scam anyone.
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:09:01
Hey - just making sure you're still interested? We're running out soon, so just wanted to verify you're still in!
@_date: 2013-07-16 16:20:40
Ah. In the original post, I believe I said to make sure you sent it from an address you control - anyway, should be fine. The timing all matches up, and nobody else has claimed your payment! :P just a message with your mailing address please.
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:31:49
Well the thing is that the extra weight of the second coin may well bump it up to the next level of weight, they are awkwardly placed.
Let's say 4.5btc total (for the two), I believe that should cover it.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:09:57
Aww... I didn't get to the clue fast enough. Thanks for the fun anyway :D
@_date: 2013-10-09 20:52:59
Unless you magically have the actual bitcoin private key that holds your funds (that you could redeem at  import) I don't believe that you will be able to get your funds back.
Here's the thread in question. Tough luck, a lot of early bitcoin businesses were run by shady folks.
@_date: 2013-07-15 21:45:44
I'll probably wait until tomorrow or the next day. If you have enough for another, I say by all means go for it, so we can order asap.
@_date: 2013-07-16 01:05:01
You must have a lot of asciminer shares if you can buy two coins with a single round of dividends! :P I'm happy to reserve the two remaining coins for you if you send payment for one of them now, and the other on wednesday.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:27:24
The best way to do this is to simply load the page, and then turn off your wifi. The page works without a network connection, as at no point does it communicate with the server after loading the page. You can then generate some addresses, and close the page before turning wifi back on, ensuring that the address is never sent.

Hi! We're happy to have you joining our ranks.
In terms of getting the bitcoin client on the CD, you can download one from here: 
Place this on a clean USB stick, which you can then transfer over to the fresh ubuntu. The trick here is that there is absolutely no connection from when the addresses are generated to the outside internet, so nobody can steal your hard-earned bitcoin!
The bitcoin client will encrypt your wallet for you, or you can use something like  which makes things even safer.
Hope this helps, and good luck!
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:55:46
You can cash it in at any time, the private key is hidden on the coin. There is no relying on Casascius in that regard.
@_date: 2013-08-21 16:32:51
Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. Good luck, and keep us outposted with updates.
@_date: 2013-08-09 13:46:40
To use the api (or even to run your own instance) you don't need python at all, it's a web api.
In terms of understanding the code, python is also incredibly easy to understand, I like it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:17:10
Hey! Yeah, I'm running that service, and it's seen a fair bit of usage. Actually one of the main uses at the moment is for mining group buys, as you can stick a single address into the mining pool that automatically pays out percentages to different shareholders.
In terms of trusting me, I'm a mod on and have successfully completed a ton of programming jobs/transactions for people in the community, I can send you others who have done stuff with me if you like.
The largest group buy (~20Th/s) that uses this system is running on a separate instance, which I licensed to the group for a fixed cost, so that there's no way that anyone using the public instance at  could influence the GB.

Hey, assuming you're the guy who wrote this article, I have a comment for your use of the tip jar - It would be a lot better to put it inline (next to your &lt;p&gt; tags, so that it doesn't cover your text - also, grab the new version, which includes a qr code! :D

@_date: 2013-06-29 16:22:11
Yeah, sorry about the miscommunication. That would indeed have added more security, but I actually do not have 39btc on hand to pay with, without using what you guys paid.
You can verify that I indeed paid Casascius with the tx and signature in the OP. 
The main use of this escrow was to make sure that we would make it to twenty coins, which we did.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:21:41
Hey, so Australia is a little further out, so I looked up the costs, and it will be an additional .1, so a total of 2.28/coin.
@_date: 2013-07-15 09:07:27
Hey! You would send the bitcoin to the address in the top post, from an address that belongs to you. If you are using a blockchain.info wallet for example, you can then easily sign a message containing your reddit username and your mailing address, signed by the bitcoin address. Then I know that you sent the payment.
Otherwise, if you don't have a blockchain.info account or don't know how to sign messages, you can just send an additional 0.0009912 with your payment (as a confirmation code, essentially), as I know that any payment coming in with 9912 at the end is now coming from you, tomEc.
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:38:11
This is correct. The nonce found corresponds to the particular configuration of payout address, transactions, previous block, etc. One valid nonce found would have an extremely low chance of working for some other unrelated configuration.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:08:10
I have to give a plug for  which is a slightly different model than you described, but a very interesting one that people are starting to use.
You essentially put a global price on a widget, and people start contributing, and once it reaches that crowdfunded level, the song is permanently released to the world (you can of course include as many formats/extra info as you like!
Consider using it to release a bonus track, or something along those lines. 
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:21:58
do we get the length/complexity of password?
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:49:23
This is really well said. A great analogy - the guy seems a little nervous, but I think he captures the essence of the fears a lot of people have.
If someone takes this idea and puts it into a slightly more condensed video with possibly some diagrams, I think it would really be helpful.
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:40:23


is the address, escrow with Yes, nobody has sent payment to that address yet, but someone has to be the first! If we don't get the full 20 coins worth in a week or so (highly unlikely) then we will refund the coins to the address that sent them.
And then remember to PM me a signed message with your physical address.
@_date: 2013-08-09 02:15:49
Sure - the automatic fowarding comes in handy, because you can send all the money straight to cold storage without holding any of the private keys on the server. The money comes into a generated address, so you can see how much was paid, but then all gets sent to a single cold storage address for payments. (that's how I do it at least)
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:12:37
ideas for additional colors? If you pass me a mockup, I can add the colors. Also, as that other guy approximated a $200 cost, I'm wondering if I can actually make some money off of this... maybe additional color schemes behind a 0.01b paywall?
@_date: 2013-07-15 23:48:36
Update: 2 left!
@_date: 2013-06-29 15:17:39
Cool. Was that you who just sent the payment? Please sign a message with your mailing address using the address you send with. Thanks for getting in on this!
@_date: 2013-07-13 20:19:42
Unfortunately I can't offer full escrow, as I need the Bitcoins that are being paid to purchase the Casascius coins.
Once the coins are shipped from the first set (should be just a couple days, Casascius said that he was nearly ready to ship our coins), you'll have 10 happy customers to ask, but for the moment, you'll have to go by my pre-group-buy reputation/experience. As I wrote above, I've conducted many successful jobs/transactions on and if you are interested in names, I can PM you some people to ask (people I've worked with).
But I understand that you can never really be certain until you have the coins in hand. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 02:54:36
I do indeed do JS. What do you need help with? Just played - main problem seems to be that it is incredibly unbalanced...
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:08:56
Fair enough! Also, all the coins have been spoken for, so that works out :P I'll send you a message when the coins are delivered, so you can see.
Yeah, it's kind of weird, because over the past two buys, random strangers who don't know who I am have sent me ~$8000... but I won't run off with it, 'cus I'm not a jerk. Anyway, have a nice day!
@_date: 2013-08-29 11:04:53
Casascius coins can be purchased with 2-factor, so even he doesn't know your private key.
@_date: 2013-06-30 05:40:46
Good question, hadn't really thought about that. Well the set comes with one large case according to the website, but I could definitely buy smaller coin cases separately, and now that I think about it, I would definitely like that, and I'm sure you all would as well.
However, it would cost a little bit more - I just found a place where I can get a 40mm plastic case (our coins are 38.1mm), and I'd be willing to add a case per coin to anyone's order for 0.02/case. And I'll include one extra if you're getting at least 3.
Send your btc to 1KqL6BDWzQTmfN1d24mQvTAFyuFjNqrEq4 with your order number of satoshi appended. (order number is your name in the list in the OP)
So if you were order number 6, and you wanted 2 cases, you'd send 0.04000006
We'll have to get a couple people ordering these before I buy the set, but I imagine we'll have a couple takers. (I'll PM this message to everyone.)

Okay, I marked down three coins for you, will confirm upon receipt of bitcoins + signed message.
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:22:12
Looking at the database, looks like you made two, and sent your BTC to this one instead (with the address 1PYQ..). It was funded instantly when the transaction occurred.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:34:47
Awesome! Thanks for supporting the BTC community.
In addition, another neat way to monetize your creations would be to use something like  where you can release a certain piece of content (be it exclusive interviews/bonus chapters, or what-have-you) once you have reached a certain level of funding.
It's been used successfully in the past, maybe give it a shot!
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:02:33
If you can't figure out how to sign, just send an additional 0.0008333 with your payment, to confirm that it's yours, and then PM me your mailing address where you would like to receive the coins!
@_date: 2013-06-17 18:48:09
I believe I found the address, but there seems to be no btc in it... is the public key not 1FqniRvY58296G53wnWESnJCKSdTJPeEWA?
@_date: 2013-07-13 09:17:02
Yes, and yes. Shipping to New Zealand will be 0.1 extra though, because the shipping is a little more expensive. (So a total of 2.35 for one coin, or 4.65 for two)
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:28:11
I can definitely ship to Australia, but I'm not certain off the bat what the shipping costs would be, so it might be a little extra.
How many would you be interested in? The more coins, the less shipping per coin.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:35:24
Ah yes, wasn't there a post about how we need to call them hackers? Yup. Good reminder.

@_date: 2013-06-28 18:19:17
Oh, just saw this. For some reason reddit does not notify me when my name is mentioned... hmm.
I've only had a couple use it so far, and they were for simple tasks. For something like a code review, I do plan on charging a small amount. My plan was for a percentage like 1-2%, but with a minimum of 0.01.
@_date: 2013-06-28 11:09:05
You are... correct. Well then, I think I'll remove that option.
@_date: 2013-08-20 10:21:13
Hey - I'm the dev behind the Jobs4Bitcoin escrow site (and a mod on the subreddit) - I could definitely code your idea up, borrowing some code from the escrow site, etc.
I'll send you a PM, and hopefully we can work something out.
@_date: 2013-07-15 22:09:49
not sure that + symbol will work :p thanks for the thought though.
@_date: 2013-07-13 20:38:00
The first twenty coins worth of payment get the coins - once the twenty coins have been all paid for, everyone sends me a message with their mailing address, signed with the bitcoin address they paid with. So far, a single coin has been paid for, because I just put the address up. 15 coins are reserved though, so one of the remaining five can be yours!
@_date: 2013-07-16 00:49:32
Ah yes, I had a bug, but it should be all fixed now!
@_date: 2013-07-13 18:19:33
Yep - but same as for New Zealand, it will be .1 extra, to make sure that it can cover costs + import etc. (so 2.35 for 1 or 4.65 for two)
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:26:49
Fair enough, makes sense. I mean in Bitcoin, you send to a specific address, which has a singular private key. You could theoretically create an address, the private key to which is known partially by two different people, so you need both to unlock the funds...
But a completely trustless &amp; automated way? I can't think of one, which is partially why I made that app :p
@_date: 2013-07-01 11:47:56
not sure, you might be able to find someone on bitcointalk, like matt said.
I'll write your name down in case we get enough people to do a second round!
@_date: 2013-05-23 12:02:02
Hehe, I like the talk. 
Glad the widget ended up working out for you :p Thanks for the shoutout.
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:24:19
Yeah, I just stuck a semi-random percentage up, by no means will it stay there. I will most likely lower to 1%. 
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:23:51
I received the order label for Batch  so it should arrive with me in the next couple days, and I should be able to send out in a couple days after that!
@_date: 2013-08-08 14:49:28
Hey - I'm a web dev and have made a ton of sites that need this behavior, so much so, that I decided to make an API for it.
You can programmatically generate a new btc address that automatically forwards anything sent to it to one, two , or as many addresses as you would like, customizable with a simple JSON object. I use it for a bunch of stuff, and I trust it (because I made it :D) but if you want to use it for a big project, I can send you the code and you can host an instance yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:55:45
Sure thing.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:19:31
Selling now would probably get you the money by Sunday/Monday.
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:27:33
I was disappointed the answer to number 2 wasn't "your mom"
@_date: 2013-06-28 09:54:42
**If you are interested, post a comment to this with the number you are interested in.**
@_date: 2013-06-28 21:09:12
Okay, I marked down a coin for you, will confirm upon receipt of bitcoins + signed message.
@_date: 2013-07-15 14:20:17
Great - I can definitely ship to Australia, it's a little more than to the EU or US, so as in the original post, it's 2.35/coin, so 4.7 for two coins.
Once you send your payment, just sign a message with your bitcoin address containing your mailing address, and you'll be all set.
@_date: 2013-08-06 02:47:01
This is a pretty neat way to both make money as a graphic designer (or amateur humorist) and also generate traffic for your own budding site by tossing a small amount of btc at the site, and watching people make ads for you! You only pay when  people upvote ads for your site, making this a very cost-effective way of popularizing your site.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:31:18
This doesn't necessarily mean that it's CampBX's fault - if you use a similar system "company+email for different sites, an intelligent system might have taken entries from a different site you signed up for and replaced instances of that site's name with "campbx".
(At least that's what I would do were I a devious scammer...)
@_date: 2013-06-29 09:32:03
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:59:47
Yes, when the coin is spent, it is no longer worth any bitcoin - but you can tell because the sticker will have been removed, revealing the private key in the back.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:53:04
Hey guys,
so I implemented this, give it a look if you wouldn't mind!
Feel free to use it wherever you would like, and comment if there is anything you might prefer to see different.
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:20:20
Nearly half have been paid for... I really have no idea when Casascius will finally get to sending out the coins, but then it will take at least a couple days to get here to the EU, and then I'll send them out asap, but I imagine it won't be much sooner than two weeks before the first set gets theirs.
If you want four, I can reserve you the four coins if you pay for two of them, and then you can pay for the other two once the first group receives theirs? How does that sound?
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:24:18
In addition to other answers in this thread, a good way to earn bitcoins is at where you can offer your skills to other people in exchange for their coins! Mining is an option, but don't expect to make more than a couple cents without specialized hardware.
@_date: 2013-06-29 09:20:27
Those are the very last two - I'll confirm you as soon as I recieve the payment!
@_date: 2013-08-09 14:16:02
It definitely is helpful to understand how bitcoind works, good luck!
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:07:38
Hey - if there's enough demand, I might go for a second roll, but there are still some slots left on this first one!
EDIT: There's still one available for you if you want it! I'm going to try to finish this out today.
@_date: 2013-06-08 00:06:05
Ah yes, I'll post the code if anyone wants to check over it, and a warning. I'd like to think that I've built some trust through a bunch of successful trades I've made with people as well.
Checking provided addresses are valid... hmm, I suppose I should add support for that.
EDIT: support has been added for address validation.

+$13.37 verify
Keep up the good work, Sean. What are your plans for this sudden inflow of funds?
@_date: 2013-07-15 19:25:35
Yeah, maybe. I still have a couple people who may purchase some, but it would be a good idea to speed things up, in case they don't respond for a while. I'll post on a chat I'm on, would you mind posting a new link to this post on @_date: 2013-06-28 11:24:47
Yes, the Silver coins.
This is the first GB that I have personally organized, though I am co-organizing two KNC miner group buys, so I have experience with the whole system and understand how it all works.
I actually am in control of the Jobs4Bitcoin escrow system, so that wouldn't exactly work, but if you are interested in escrow (it would only be until we get twenty buys and I purchase the coins though) I'd be willing to ask the admin of Jobs4Bitcoins, to hold the escrow address.
@_date: 2013-08-22 00:32:20
Still in Beta, but perfectly functional. I hope it proves to be helpful! 
If we have any **graphic designers** in the house who would like to take a stab at a better UI for the widget itself, give it a go and PM me with an image, and if I like it, I'd be happy to compensate you.
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:51:44
[Coinbase]( a good idea - they take a small fee (1%) but it is worth it for the convenience. 
It will take a couple days to verify your bank account if you don't already have an account, but it would be done by Sunday.
Otherwise, finding someone in person who would like to buy them is slightly more risky, but could eliminate the 1% fee. If you live in a city, this shouldn't be too difficult.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:13:34
Great job pulling this together. Looking forward to trying it out!
