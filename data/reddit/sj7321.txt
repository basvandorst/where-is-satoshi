Appeal of Bitcoin will never reach majority of population at a serious level.
Stock Markets have been from centuries still it doesn't attracted majority of people in world.
Crypto will move to and fro between specific range..but certainly cannot reach 1 million US dollars.
Reason is non reliability..because buying and selling crypto makes Investor vulnerable to Exchanges.
Bitcoin has no value without middle man(In this case:Crypto Exchange like Binance/Gdax/coinbase.)
Also.one need to give huge attention to it.
Person with responsibilities might not give much time for it.
Alertness level of person decrease in case of other responsibilities.
It is an extremely good option for short term trading and short term Investments but never a long term.
Old days of Bitcoin hodling is not possible now.
Market Dynamics have changed now.
I am buying one farm that will cost me about 1 to 2 bitcoin(3 acres)..I will rather buy this and relax for 5 years and sale it again for confirmed higher price than buying Bitcoin at x and praying everyday to see my Bitcoin price go 2X or 3X or see my BTc growth everyday.
Bitcoin can also be taxed very easily.
Government will not give a fucc as long as you hold a Bitcoin/crypto with you.
but the moment you earn money via exchange...
prepare to get Income tax notice from IT department...

Crypto is nonsense..
Start some good business and become rich.
Don't waste time reading values on Binance and straining eyes,with no good profit.
Shitcoins are hopeless..
goes 50% on day one,goes  minus 50 percent on day 3.
