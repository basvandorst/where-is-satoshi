Development of BtcPayServer has been focused toward trustless solution - you can even use 3rd party hosting provider because all you do to initialize your store is set derivation scheme for public key.
So, server doesn't have private key. Also, BtcPayServer is great for those that want to bring up and host FULL Bitcoin node.
I understand it's different priority list - but eventually I think we'll get to more support for fiat conversion. In the meantime - it's more about focusing on features important for decentralization, trustless interaction and making it more easy to use.

I think m$ gets undeserved flak on this - they've been consistently been pushing out what I see as the best development platform for over a decade.
Plus open source push that's been going on in last few years is awesome... you can find both VSCode and .NET Core source on Github.

Definitely, I am really thankful to CheapAir guys for choosing BtcPayServer over Bitpay. 
And also lots of businesses choose BtcPayServer when they find out Bitpay forces BIP70 on them which lots of wallets don't support.
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:29:11
100% agree.
Let me know when you start campaign to educate people on how to generate wallet addresses and BTC transactions in command line.
WE CAN DO IT!!!
TERMINAL/CMD OR GTFO.

What says on KYC is pretty much nutshell of what's going on.
And yes - us developers of BTCPayServer do the same thing BUT (a BIG BUT) we are also giving you source code so you can easily add on missing parts to your system. Like if you want "crypto -&gt; fiat" you can add it on your own... and not need to beg Coinbase (or anyone) for thing you need.
@_date: 2018-08-18 08:34:03
^^^ Awesome guide
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:17:25
It warms my heart whenever I see how much love you people send our way. That makes developing BtcPayServer even more fun...  ;)
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:09:37
So 24 invoices per second, eh?
Hit us up on:  and we can make a test that tries to get that throughput.
My nick over there is **RockstarDev**... we also need to get and see how big of priority he sees this.

And in hindsight that interaction on Twitter looks awesome:

You can tweak setup scripts any way you want. If we look at what LunaNode does - it's just automation of bringing up virtual machine that will run Docker containers and that you can SSH into.
Once it has that it just clones  repository and executes `btcpay-setup.sh` 
So if you want you tweak LND fees all you need to do after completing LunaNode setup is to SSH into machine and use `bitcoin-lncli.sh` to send `lncli` command to LND container and set fees.
@_date: 2018-10-15 03:15:56
Pruning is supported... if you plan on running LND then that'll limit how aggressively you can prune. See  for options we support in our deployment scripts.

As someone involved with the project - I was really looking forward to this. It's easy for us tech guys to bring up "always online" Bitcoin+LN node, but it wasn't easy/cheap for average user.
With this launcher it is now both very easy and very affordable. Plus there is great update mechanism in place so users can easily update whole setup in case something like CVE-2018-17144 happens.
@_date: 2018-10-20 06:20:04
Thank you for being voice of reason. I've learned long ago not to argue with people about tech stacks... always feels silly discussing theories/meta vs actual code.
And you - man, you are something. I wish there was a way to utilize that combativeness and passion of yours for something productive...
@_date: 2018-10-18 14:13:52
I was a Trump Trainee when .NET 1.1 was released and he paid me big money to use it and hush about it. It just went from there...
@_date: 2018-10-15 02:26:23
My primary motivation for joining the project (besides coding with Nicolas ofc) was to see what can be done to simplify the process of bringing up tech stack for "financial sovereignty".
Reality is that amount of services you need to host and maintain in order to truly be "sovereign" can be very intimidating. So from my perspective - it's all about continuously lowering that barrier.
I do hope this thread will further increase awareness of the project and that we'll have more people join the effort... hopefully in next few months we'll get to the point where everyone will find it more convenient and practical to bring up new Full Bitcoin + Lightning Network Node with BTCPay Server on top... than swallow bitter pill and register for BitPay merchant account.

To just add a bit to what already said - .NET Core is fully open source under MIT license and runs on Linux. Microsoft has this history of being presented as "evil"... but most of that look today is very outdated. Sure, under Gates Microsoft was very ruthless, then under Balmer MSFT was just stupid (that whole Linux = cancer ordeal)...
But now under Satya they are doing a LOT of very cool stuff. Last big news I liked was that 60K patents they've open sourced. Google it if you haven't.
So, I wouldn't let past get in the way of future. You can get source code of pretty much whole tech stack from Github (bitcoind, .NET Core, BtcPayServer...) compile it yourself and deploy in any way you want. Our primary deployment is on Linux containers through Docker, but feel free to tweak it and use it in any way you see fit.

I'm sure CardCollector1 will handle majority of questions posted here, but if there is anything technical or me can chime in.
Especially if you have questions on how you can start developing or you saw Issue on GitHub you think you can handle - ping me either here or on Slack (RockstarDev) or Twitter (r0ckstardev).
@_date: 2018-10-18 14:45:56
I'll have fun in VSCode on Linux:

If you don't manage to resolve issue with VOIP definitely hit us up on Slack like Bitcoinshirtco said and we'll take care of it.

Sorry to disappoint you. Please crush us someone else, we deserve it.

Did you deposit Bitcoin or dirty fiat to your balance before trying to launch VM?

Great guide And for anyone curious to join development - we are welcoming everyone with open arms... just jump on Slack and let's keep improving this open source project.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:56:56
Hey everyone, one of the BtcPayServer developers here. One of the links I would add to your list is our Slack: 
There are lots of knowledgeable people in that channel, so if you are stuck with anything there will likely be someone to help. Also, is quite active here on Reddit... don't know how much time he has to answer questions though ;)
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:26:12
To add to responses - we did get issue opened for Ethereum: 
Nicolas has done some refactoring to make support easier - feel free to ping that developer on GitHub issue and inquire about status of feature. From my experience devs are always more motivated to do some work when they see there is interest for what they are working on.
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:49:31
"BTCPay open source community is awesome"  
&lt;3 
@_date: 2018-03-11 07:07:06
Don't be down about it - that's Reddit in nutshell. Majority is here for simple and easy content. You wrote great guide and that's all that matters... 
You mentioned BTC Pay Slack in your post so anyone who wants in-depth discussion will meet us there. Influx of new people in last few weeks has been great... there are new plugins, lots of new documentation. Nicolas has been pulling the boat mostly on his own... I've helped with coding but expected more commits by others. 
Who knows, Lightning Network integration is coming up next... and after that goes live we may see more coders on the project.
@_date: 2018-07-09 17:39:08
Sure on label... but my direct coding experience with LND and CLightning has me saying "solid" because is it kinda like "Gmail beta".
Meaning, devs are holding that "beta" label mostly because they don't want to be under scrutiny for potential breaking changes + they want to see more real-world testing. If you think there will be huge changes between now and "production" release - well, you'll be disappointed.
@_date: 2018-07-09 03:37:26
"3 lightning nodes"? If you mean implementations, they are pretty solid already... and there are already quite few Lightning Network shops, I love guide by that he posted in this subreddit a while ago:
@_date: 2018-07-11 04:58:33
Unfortunately this is true. You do need to support merchants to a degree. When I was reaching out to CheapAir to get them to consider BtcPayServer it got me thinking how someone needs to be there to answer questions.
It's understandable, even if business has like $10,000 in daily volume, they can't "play" with it. They want to make sure they are making right decision. So they'll ask questions until integration is complete and working.
So yeah - actively reach out to merchants. And also fiat conversion... that one is tough. Paying bills still requires dirty fiat. But, we do have some things come up related to this...
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:51:11
As says, if you have a channel pointing at you with enough funds you can use that. As long as there is route you are good.
If you run into any problems with checkout, ping me. I'm working on redesigning it to make Lightning Network payments more obvious, so whatever feedback people have on using the page - it would be valuable for me to hear it.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:22:48
Yeah, I still need to figure out how to also display Node Info on "Scan" tab and not only in "Copy" tab: 
Thanks for helping others and spreading adoption CardCollector!
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:27:34
I didn't see you comment on this picture during AMA... we are waiting. ;)
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:43:53
Yeah, and if BtcPayServer IS broken in your browser... that's likely also thanks to me ;)
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:22:56
Thanks for the mention ;). And if there are any C# developers around here that are willing to join us, hit us up either over Slack or Github!
