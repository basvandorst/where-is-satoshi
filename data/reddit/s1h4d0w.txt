Thanks for this post, just watched his “bitcoin for beginners” video and I finally have something for my lil bro to watch seeing as he wanted to buy some without any real knowledge of how it works.

The comment you replied to said: "it costs the relevant financial institutions very little if not nothing"
What I meant was, if it costs the institution nothing why would they charge for it? It's a part of their service, not their whole service. It's like saying "oh we got some stickers for free from our supplier, want to buy one?"

Ehm... if something is free, why would anyone have to make you pay for it? If it doesn't cost you anything why would you charge a customer for it? That just seems like pure capitalism.

The Netherlands, and these are just bank cards. They have NFC so you can pay wirelessly. Payments above 25 euros require a PIN code, and it will require a PIN if you’ve paid a certain amount wirelessly. The money is taken directly out of your bank account.

It’s weird, in my country we all pay by card, not a credit card but just a card that takes money directly from our account. Most stores prefer you pay by card, even if you are only buying something for 50 cents. A lot of them also don’t like to deal with a lot of cash, as they’ll be an easier target for criminals.

Yes, pretty much anything is possible if you make it

Pretty fun game, thanks! One nitpicky thing I’d like to see is to have the replay button more to the bottom of the screen. I play with my thumb at the bottom of the screen and it would be nice to be able to just go again without having to change my grip. I assume most people play like that to avoid blocking the character or track.
