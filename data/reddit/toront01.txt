Wow definitely don't use this wallet. It is likely a scam, but if not, there are too many red flags on their website.

No, that is a chart of the *value* of the transactions in the mempool, not the *size* of the mempool. This means that the total value of transactions at the time of the hack was 700,000 BTC. The actual amount of transactions (size of mempool) was not backlogged at 5 in the morning.

So why bother with all this nonsense? Why don't you put the code up on github so everyone can verify and install the apps directly from source?
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:03:32
All the automated checks do is make sure your app is properly built with all icons and that it doesn't call any private APIs or use any OS functionality that is prohibited. They can't possibly automate checking if they send signed transactions to their addresses or send private keys to their own servers or any other way of stealing your bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-30 21:29:12
Could be a mixing address. The whole point of it is to obfuscate where bitcoins are coming and going, so it is doubtful that you will be able to determine whose bitcoin also got sent to the scam address. Your bitcoins are still there though. You should be more interested in seeing where they will be sent to, not who else sent money to that address.

This would add a barrier to entry for new developers.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:52:35
No this is not a good solution at all. They can work with timed or remote switches that will only begin stealing once Apple has tested, and they can also only steal once you've deposited a high enough balance so you get comfortable with it.

That doesn't mean they don't use cold storage. That just means that they use BitGo as a third party to sign their transactions, from cold or hot storage.

Because banking apps only use real life customers of their physical banks. Nobody will download an app for "Totally Legit Bank" because that bank has no customers. For bitcoin, any app can serve as a real wallet.

You can still own the code if you put it up on github. Use a restrictive license. Also, you are giving the app away for free and not charging anything. Not sure how this would affect you staying in business.


No it isn't. People can't see how the code you show on your site is actually used in the app and can't see if it is actually the real code running in the app. People need to be able to build your app from source.


Then use a restrictive license and contact the various app stores to take down clones if they arise.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:38:53


Then your approach does not stop that from happening. Someone can inspect the extension versions and android app like you said and copy all the code. This is not a valid excuse for not publishing complete buildable source code.

Your fee rate is 40 satoshis/byte, but current fee to get into a block is about 60. The transaction fee was estimated by your wallet before a large gap in block discovery which pushed fee rate up considerably. It should confirm overnight though.

Nobody has said this yet, but this is because 0.13 ups the dbcache to 300 mib from 100 mib. This increases the speed of syncing. With your computer, you could probably put the dbcache to several gigabytes and you would sync so much faster.

No he signed a timelocked transaction that will send 1000 BTC to 1BitcoinEater at block 425000. So those coins will be burned if he doesn't send them some where else before then.

It seems miners intentionally turned off hashpower before the retarget so that the difficulty would drop. They've now turned it all back on and then some, so hashpower is up and difficulty is down. This means blocks will be found faster, so transaction throughput is increased.

I think Apple will have to go ahead and ban bitcoin wallets because of this. How are they supposed to vet every single bitcoin wallet that gets submitted to the App Store. The same will happen with Google Play. These companies can't vet every bitcoin wallet app. These few apps that are brought up here are infringing on real wallets names, but what if someone just put out a new wallet that was a scam? How will Apple distinguish between that and a legit wallet?

Tiny inputs don't fire anti-spam rules, only tiny outputs. If you send all 4 coins to a single address then the output is 4 bitcoins, so it won't be considered spam. You will need to provide more information on what the issue is. Do you have the transaction id that you can post here?

No, being able to view the source is not "mostly" open source. They need to have an open source license. Also, there is no way to verify that the code on the site is actually present in the app you are using. Stay away from Jaxx.

@_date: 2016-08-05 19:54:59
This raises a very interesting predicament for Apple, as well as Google and anyone else who runs curated and trusted app stores. 
Apple does not endorse bitcoin, and can't be held liable if people lose bitcoins because they use an app that they approved. What happens if it is a community trusted app that had their credentials stolen and the attacker uploaded a malicious version? How can Apple vet every version that gets uploaded? If Bitfinex can get compromised how can Apple say these apps are ok?

No, I said you don't know whose coins the others are, since they are coming from a mixer. You don't know that they are from the scammer, and they likely aren't. Someone else got scammed but they sent the coins from the output of a mixer. Creating a new address for each victim is more work just for a scam, so why would they bother?

So increase of capacity will reduce fees from $0.14 to $0.07. How does this realistically change anything? Bitcoin doesn't care if you want to use a credit card for anything under $25. Go do that.

[Current fee to guarantee the next block is $0.14]( How will an increase in block capacity affect your life really?
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:26:02
No, minimum relay fee is 0.00001 BTC. Blockchain wallet fee is ten times the minimum. When there isn't a spam attack that is more than enough, since a normal sized transaction is 226 bytes it works out to 44 satoshis/byte. [Currently 40 satoshis/byte will guarantee you next block]( However, during the spam attack last week it was not.

This is not possible to do with an exchange. Transactions do not happen on chain, so if a user makes a trade for 10 bitcoin he will not be able to see the 10 bitcoin on any address until he withdrawals. Similarly, if he has an open order to sell 10 bitcoin, what happens on chain when that order gets filled? If it was a truly segregated wallet how could the buyer verify on his own wallet that he now has the 10 bitcoin immediately?

The minimum is 0.00001 BTC, an order of magnitude less than that amount. You generally don't need as much as 0.0001 BTC. Your tx has 10 satoshis/byte, and would usually be included in the next few blocks. However, this could take longer if there is really high transaction volume coupled with miners having bad luck. As is the case right now. Your tx will go through, just have patience. This is a reason why RBF txs should become more popular.

This is wrong. Your phone is much safer than numbers 2 and 3, provided you have the backup phrase in a safe spot and your phone is not jailbroken. If it's jailbroken all bets are off.

No, they can only withdraw once the user reconnects to Steam. A simple attack would be to double spend the payment for an expensive single player game and download it quickly, then immediately disconnect from Steam and use offline mode. You can play the entire game for free.

Why do you wish ethereum the best? It is a direct competitor to bitcoin. People invested in bitcoin should be aggressively hostile towards it. Name calling against ethereum is helpful to bitcoin.

Hi Great job getting your wallet on Android! I was just wondering what security benefit hardware encryption has for a bitcoin wallet, as your team espouses on your blog. What attack vector is possible without hardware encryption, and how does your wallet defeat that attack?

Cool thanks for that. But going further as I asked in this thread, what attack vector is possible without hardware encryption, and how does breadwallet defeat that attack?
