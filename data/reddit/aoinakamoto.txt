777 mbtc big prize puzzle coming up very soon too, will double as solution of the 77 mbtc puzzle.
@_date: 2019-07-08 23:44:25
Part of my quizchain series of Bitcoin puzzles, second stage of this one will have 777 mbtc prize.
@_date: 2019-07-24 22:34:40
Number 155 in my series of Bitcoin puzzles called the quizchain. Will need hints to be solved. Hints will come up later. Prize goes to charity if not solved by 7th July 2022 or Mayer multiple goes over $100 per mbtc.

In Mycelium, look for the menu point "cold storage" (second from top after clicking on the three points at the top left), then use the QR code of your paper wallet.

If you have a paper wallet, you can just hand it to someone else without an on chain transaction (provided they trust you not to keep and use the private key).
If you have an opendime, you can just hand it to someone else without an on chain transaction and they do not need to trust you (since you would not know the private key in the first place).

There is only one seed. Use the seven sentences, seperated by one space and generate one hash and one only from that.

Part of the quizchain, an experiment with BItcoin puzzles where I gave away over 500 mbtc in prizes over the last weeks. This part has Satoshi's real identity as a topic.
I will keep your comment in mind for the next time I post a link instead of a text.

That was my understanding too. I have not checked if the download there comes with the 2015 blockchain, but it seemed plausible to me. If not, one would need to find a different URL in the archive.

For example, if you chose d) at question 1 and c) at question 2, you would enter
"There were were only two posts about price on the Bitcoin subreddit.  Franklin D. Roosevelt required all American citizens by executive order 6102 to deliver all of their gold at the fixed price of $20.67 before May 1st." (leaving out the leading d) and c)).
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:59:08
I am doing this experiment for the first time. One thing I want to achieve is getting the description process right, gaining experience.
Again, do one SHA 256 hash of all seven strings, seperated by one space. Then use that as entropy. Do not use strings directly as entropy. The Coleman tool would not accept them in the entropy field anyway.
@_date: 2019-04-21 14:05:30
You can use any information to create a brain wallet. I have written about that in detail in my introduction to my quizchain experiment, where I use brain wallet technology to play with Bitcoin quiz use cases.
For starters, search for Ian Coleman's BIP 39 tool, you can do lots of interesting things with that...
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:42:06
Sorry, I missed that one. Yes, standard BIP 44 derivation path. Default in Ian Coleman tool not changed.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:14:12
Update: Someone has swiped the address, thanks to everyone for playing.
My answer to the questions: 1 c) 2 a)  3 d) 4 a) (obvious at first sight) 5 b) 6 d) and 7 a).
Thanks to Ian Coleman for the tool at iancoleman.io/bip39/, which I used to derive the brain wallet from the hash of the correct answer.
Again, thanks for playing. Maybe we try this again on Pizza Memorial Day.
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:58:14
Very likely to be true, though not necessarily today.

I posted an explanation of my view of the questions above. Here it is again:
2 was the most difficult question, with 2c) being devised to trick participants. It is all correct except the last words. At "before May 1st" it must be "before or on May 1st". Confiscating the gold at below world market prices and defaulting on the gold clauses on government debt was much of the problem with this Executive Order. Anyone familiar with these matters would immediately recognize a) as the correct answer.
Question 1 is easily solved by going to the December 8 archive page (the first ever for the Bitcoin subreddit) at archive.org.
Right answer to 3 is "several hundred" as stated in a post by Satoshi in 2009 on bitcointalk.
4 is obvious at first sight but easily checked with a block explorer. Anyone except Yang isn't even on the map. 5 to 7 are also just a question of googling a bit. 
I did the whole thing on an impulse and didn't take much time to think about these questions.
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:43:14
All answers with final period.
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:38:08
You don't know. I might have spent some time to think about a lot of questions then post answers to comments here, because I am an evil person. I know that is not true, but you don't.
I am surprised that the funds are still not swept. I will give it another 12 hours, then I will send them to some charity and discuss how this experiment went in hindsight from my point of view.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:43:22
It is just a matter of changing the "0" in 2020 to lowercase o and then finding the correct checksum (the last 6 characters of the address). There is an online tool for that.
@_date: 2019-04-13 13:01:54
This is actually not a theoretical question. Somebody could use the word "Bitcoin" to generate a hash, then generate a BIP 39 wallet from that. Anybody guessing that weak password now has access to private keys in that wallet.
I am doing this all the time right now in an experiment to have people guess the hash for a wallet as part of a quiz. If you don't want people to access your wallet, be careful with brain wallets...
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:26:31
Does not matter. You will find the address right at the top in Coleman's tool. No need to actually input 12 words and load a wallet software.
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:44:44
24 words are only a method of remembering the seed.
You just input the hash in the entropy field of the Coleman tool and wait until it finishes calculating, then look at the first address at the bottom.
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:42:37
I will leave this discussion for some time now. If there is no winner in the next ten hours or so, those 7 million satoshis will go to the Wikileaks donation address. In any event I will explain exactly what I intended to be the correct answers and from there on how I proceeded to derive the public address and the private key.
Again, I am surprised that it took so long. I expect to learn how to do this better next time (maybe for Pizza Memorial Day).

This is block 67 of the quizchain experiment I am running. Introduction to the format available at my Twitter feed. Already over 500 mbtc in prizes distributed until now.

Legacy Bitcoin address starting with 1,

No, just copy the answer as is, with spaces and period at the end.
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:10:45
Still not swept after 50 minutes. Definitely taking longer than average block...
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:15:50
Looking back, I learned a couple of things from this experiment.
The positive side: This actually works. I was worried for some time that I messed up somewhere and made it impossible to solve. It was fun to do (one of the main objects here). And I think it was a nice way to celebrate Satoshi's birthday.
What I would improve next time: Don't answer questions on the format. It is part of the challenge to figure out how to find and use the tools like the Ian Coleman tool. Make that clear in the original post. Also, give a time limit in the original post after which the funds are sent to the Wikileaks donation address. Said time limit should be around an hour, which is ample time to figure out 7 answers and swipe the address, but not enough time to try brute forcing the quiz. After time runs out, immediately post a link to the donation transaction and an explanation of the questions as seen by me. Avoid questions like 5 to 7 this time which are obvious after googling a bit and aim for questions like 2 which require some more understanding of the matter.
Again, thanks to anyone participating.

What is new about this use case? Bitcoin was always able to do transactions.

There is nothing to stop him in my setup. For various reasons, I would be surprised if he actually claimed the prize.
@_date: 2019-05-30 05:27:18
You can make a deterministic wallet seed from any list of 12 words you want.
Just take a hash of that word list or any other data with enough entropy to be safe, then use that hash as a seed value.
I am doing this kind of thing all the time running a quizchain experiment (at the "grycoin" subreddit), where the answer to a quiz is hashed to reveal the private key to a prize I sent before to that address.
So short answer, this is absolutely possible. Just be sure you know what you are doing, you can lose funds this way.

778 mbtc given away in Bitcoin puzzle prize money over 77 blocks of the first quizchain run. Last block 77 uses puzzle written by Satoshi. Probably a couple of days left until last block is solved.

Thank you. Where did you find that?
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:40:44
This is not a clue, as I explain in new Wattpad story chapter, answer does not matter for solving block 77.
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:00:07
The seed phrase is just a random number, the words serve only to make it easier to remember for humans.
You can let a wallet generate that random seed or do it yourself. I am generating lots of seeds for the quizchain Bitcoin puzzles experiment I am running right now, learning interesting things about seed phrases.
You can use any information you want as input for a hash to generate the seed. If you use something easily brute forced, it will be brute forced in short order. Generating a seed yourself may be not safe if you don't know what you are doing.

I have posted 77 Bitcoin puzzles in my Quizchain experiment over the last couple of weeks, giving away prizes of 838 mbtc over the whole chain of puzzles.
This is the last block for now, using the Genesis Block address written by Satoshi as a puzzle.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:41:22
Thank you for your feedback.
Single blocks have the large advantage that it is less likely I make a mistake. It is open to debate if multiple blocks are unfair, since all players would challenge them under the same conditions.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:26:12
If you would like to collect a 77 mbtc prize, here is a chance to challenge two big prize blocks.
The quizchain is a series of bitcoin puzzles I am running since a couple of weeks, first series of 77 blocks concluding and second started just now.

It means that the address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa can't have been freely chosen by Satoshi as a vanity burn address, since it would be impossible to find the public key from the address.
That in turn means I have been wrong to assume this address was written by Satoshi. It is completely random data.
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:18:57
77 mbtc puzzle on the address here:
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:01:18
Thank you for that detailed explanation. So the short version is that yes, this public key is right in the genesis block.
