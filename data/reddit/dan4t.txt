Not very useful for buying drugs either. They are switching to Monero and Bitcoin Cash.

Cryptocurrencies as a whole have more in common with the internet, than Bitcoin specifically. Lots of early internet products failed.

It's not clear which Bitcoin fork he's referring to though.

I don't see how that helps enough to solve the problem. Fees will still be huge, even if slightly lower.

There are so many ways to launder cryptocurrencies by trading for coins like Dash and Monero, and splitting the coins over and over into different chunks.

That's way too much work just to make one anonymous comment. Plus by the time you get the karma, the thread you wanted to comment in will be old and no one will see it.

Are you claiming that Bitcoin Cash only has one developer? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:16:50
Not really. The code is still public, just not on Github specifically.

The problem with this is that lots of other subreddits are starting to do this. If almost all subreddits eventually use this policy, reddit will become closed to new user participation.

How could it be the future of money if the block size doesn't change? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:16:32
Meh, it's decentralized enough if I as a low income earner can store the block chain on my computer.

Can you give an example of of some of the things Ver ignored?

Why do you think they are troll accounts?

He isn't arguing that no one gets banned... He was pretty darn explicit about that. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:37:11
Why would the price of Bitcoin cause transactions to get stuck? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:36:59
It is. This one week old account is just evading a ban from previous account.
The rate limiting is due to downvotes, and applies to all subreddits on the website. Mods have nothing to do with this. It's not an option that can be turned off. You can create your own subreddit and see for yourself.

He also points out that another cryptocurrency could take over. Cryptocurrency will grow. But it's not clear which ones.

Open discussion does not mean anarchy where no post ever gets removed... 
Not saying I agree with the ban though. I just want to point out there there can be reasonable limits on speech and still be open. Obvious examples like calls for violence. Or in the case of reddit, spam, doxxing, etc.

Don't stay in one echo chamber. Use both and make up your own mind.
