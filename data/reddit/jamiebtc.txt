To be honest i think its going to take a good few years for the banks to get their heads round the bitcoin technology. Nothing like it has ever existed before. I am interested to see how they can reach the level of security that bitcoin has and who would be buying into their blockchain. How do they incentivize securing their bank ledger for example?

It's already been embedded into the Truth Machine. Presumably to stop regulators tampering with it:
@_date: 2015-06-20 00:31:18
It's definitely feasible but i can see a whack-a-mole scenario happening. Bitcoin gets hit and so people migrate to other digital currencies instead. I know there are no major competitors to bitcoin right now but i expect that to change in the next 5 years
@_date: 2015-06-13 13:59:54
Cringe. Stop separating bitcoin from the blockchain BBC. Ah i see, bitcoin is used by criminals but blockchains by upstanding citizens, is that how they are trying to portray it?  
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:23:32
That's my strategy. I've actually got more savings in bitcoin than i have in GBP. I'm bloody insane but worse things happen at sea i suppose

Same here. Doesn't seem 5 minutes that people were in a frenzy about them busting out the old 51% attack. They'd be hard pushed to give that a go now. They might have a hidden vault of toasters but not plugged them in yet however

Don't know about anyone else but i found that quite an engrossing read. There are some great observations and reflections in there 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:12:40
What are you involved in exactly? Have you been working on POE.com? I'm starting a non-profit and think it will be a good idea to embed the governing document, dissolution process, and other important things into the blockchain 
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:56:52
My other wallets are backed up. I didn't bother with this one as it was a small amount. Thanks for the info though
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:25:12
Agreed. I'm no expert but hearing his argument there seems to be a lot of advantages to faster blocks. You would require more confirmations but these would occur at a much faster rate. This would be appealing to shop floor merchants in the future no? 
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:19:06
I think the problem is that it is too early to rely on fees. If i wanted to spend 1000 bits but had to pay the same amount in fees just to get it confirmed within a few days, i (and most likely many others) wouldn't bother. I'm no expert but raising the blocksize seems like the best option and can give us breathing room whilst the LN etc are being worked on. If there was a peak in adoption later this year and there was a transaction backlog it could make the network unusable for some i expect
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:26:00
Nail on head
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:13:02
Spot on. I enjoy listening to both of them

@_date: 2015-05-30 12:46:27
They should accept bitcoin. I'm going to email them and suggest it
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:30:36
Agreed. The 21 million cap can never be touched and the rate of issue should remain the same
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:38:08
This sector is really important for growth and adoption imo 
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:50:37
Agreed, they know what exists now (and can guess about the future) but if they can keep their plans secret for such a length of time so can the competition. Still i think its good what 21 are doing for the ecosystem and will be following it closely 
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:22:34
It will spread naturally due to a combination of its utility and the greed of banks/remittance providers
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:48:54
Yes. I work with drug addicts and there are a multitude of factors which lead to addiction. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:12:28
I was thinking the same thing. They've got no idea what capacity China can add to the network from one day to the next 
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:51:58
Won't this idea be good for decentralization? What if 21 shipped 100p/h of electronic devices around the world and made up 20% of the global hashrate? I'm not saying they are capable of that but isn't it more desirable than having 5 big farms in China? 
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:06:00
This could really help millions if only they knew about it. Some of the things being built on top of the bitcoin protocol are really interesting and more importantly have utility 
@_date: 2015-05-13 11:02:30
If i'm not earning bitcoin for flicking a lightswitch on or off i won't be happy!
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:34:00
Also, does this site require more than 1 confirmation before the document proof is embedded? Thanks
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:06:48
Exactly. It could be a really good way of spreading out the mining if that were to happen
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:25:41
And spending it all on Agora. You have to kick your lightbulb out of the apartment  because its addicted to crystal meth 
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:28:34
I was one of the many who thought bitcoin would die out. I lost the 12 simply by storing a password in my phones vault then losing it at a gig. I didn't actually give a shit at the time but when the price hit $1200 a coin the following year i immediately started giving lots of shits. Not because i was money motivated but because i was unemployed at the time and 1 satoshi meant a lot  
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:17:51
Would it be wise to reduce it to 5 minute blocks, then 2.5 minutes and then finally 1 or just go straight to 1? Slow broadband speed in many countries would be an issue i believe

This did occur to me. How do these exchanges even know where people are located? If needed couldn't you just connect to Bitfinex via a VPN? 
@_date: 2015-08-21 16:52:53
Haha isn't dementia on the rise worldwide? We'll probably end up with about 5 coins by the year 2140 due to memory loss. I've lost about 16 coins through getting pissed and losing phones etc. I wasn't really thinking about making bitcoin more scarce whilst throwing up on the pavement admittedly 
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:52:29
Bitcoins algorithms don't give a shit quite frankly. It just rumbles on like earth orbiting the sun
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:24:02
To back this up i'd recommend experimenting with Shapeshift.io 
After one go you will be able to see how easy it is to exchange between digital currencies, and how brain numbing and tedious it can be when fiat is involved

The combined complexity and absurdity of this bitlicense shows to me how desperately the powers that be are clinging on to their power. I just don't see how they can properly enforce the ShitLicense and god help them when Augur and Openbazaar join the party

Yes. I think OP was asking if say 5 computers could each store 20% of the BC or something like that. I hadn't looked at it that way before and i'm not sure if there would be any benefits to it
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:23:34
Perhaps merged mining can come in. So miners may be mining and securing the bitcoin network whilst being rewarded in other altcoins at the same time (which they could trade for bitcoin if they wanted)

It's difficult to predict what Bitcoin is going to do in 6 months time nevermind in 5 to 10 years. It's still in its infancy and will just evolve and spread naturally as people seek alternatives to debt currencies. Bitcoin is the most advanced form of money the world has ever seen but only a tiny percentage of the world population has noticed this. Some Orchids have been known to take 25+ years to flower and some Oak tree's live to be 1000 years old. Things which become most valuable and sought after often take time to manifest. Gold doesn't grow on tree's in front of your eyes

Nice idea but as A.Antonopolous said recently 'Bitcoin isn't ready for Greece and Greece isn't ready for Bitcoin' 
The average Greek isn't going to convert the little money they can acquire into a digital currency that they can't spend easily on essential items (food, medicine etc). We also don't have the network capacity to cope with a huge influx of new users just yet

Does that apply only to paper wallet addresses or all? What if an organization wanted to use a single bitcoin address for transparency purposes which showed all the funds going in and out of it? Is that not recommended?

Thanks i didn't realize that. Do you know when the first sidechains will be available for the general public to use? Are we talking 1 years time, 2 years time, longer? Or is it not possible to put a timescale on it at this stage? I really think the confidential transaction feature is something that should be considered a high priority

A huge amount of time, intellectual and technical knowledge has been invested into bitcoin's design to solve the problem of coins falling out your pocket and down the back of the sofa.

A.Antonopolous said we need to reach the point where the average car = 1 bitcoin and the average loaf of bread = 100 bits for example. I think its too far in the future to comprehend or predict.

How do miners 'price it in'? Surely they have paid for all their hardware in advance of the impending halfing? Switching off isn't really an option as advancements in ASIC tech happen very quickly so will they just have to sell off some of their mining equipment?

So do all block explorers run their own node and only display the unconfirmed transactions in their own mempool? 
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:34:00
I think it's too early to say merchant processing is dead. It's not taken off like we (and Bitpay) expected but it will continue to grow steadily i think

This and Augur are the two most exciting bitcoin apps imo. I'm already planning a store for OpenBazaar 
@_date: 2015-10-23 16:46:53
I want to lock the absolute shit out of my coins until the block reward halves. No idea why that is such a big event in my mind as it'll probably not affect the price too much but i still visualize myself Yacht shopping and buying my own island regardless. Best add to those 2 coins..
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:13:25

Are Bitmain and BW the closest competitors to Bitfury? 
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:28:15
Good one. Many people are not aware they can be divided which may sound stupid to most of us
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:13:15
Only that they float away in the wind if you don't watch them
@_date: 2015-10-09 16:16:59
In theory but not in practice. My money is on OpenBazaar for the killer app and it's going to take a lot to dissuade me at the moment 
@_date: 2015-10-06 03:05:07
Coinkite and Armory will secure the shit out of your bitcoins. Copay is also good and much simpler to use

I see thanks for the info. Peatix do accept bitcoin but only in Japan and not the UK unfortunately. I've asked them why and suggested using Bitpay so i will see what their response is

By christmas do you mean when Agora is online? :D
@_date: 2015-10-13 05:55:36
So is it not possible for the 0.3 to go to the address where the 1.0 came from? I just wondered as i was told for security reasons you shouldn't reuse addresses
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:51:08
@_date: 2015-10-15 07:55:44
Why would people claim to use a more secure method when they aren't? I'll assume you know how to identify a multi-sig address

I've got a alot of faith in Bitpay to deliver in the future. Their apps and services are sound as a ~~pound~~ bitcoin

Gox was a mess for the people who got done but it's helped the ecosystem as a whole in my opinion. Security has been much improved since then and people often use Gox as an example of how not to run an exchange. 
Oh and i prefer to take responsibility of my own money and i'm much happier keeping bitcoin in cold storage than trusting my bank with fiat.

Looks good. Is Joinmarket up and running? I remember trying to use it several months ago but got a bit lost and confused
@_date: 2015-10-09 01:14:44
Can't this help keep mining decentralized in a small way? Also if your router has an assigned bitcoin address couldn't Bitmesh users pay into it automatically when that is up and running? 
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:53:12
I think that was a little different. I believe Karpeles was using his own personal bank account to do trading and Gox was a million miles away from being a professionally run business 
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:10:00
Haha nice one
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:18:23
Haha sorry Max. For what its worth ive used LB for two years and have bought most my coins there. It's been the best onramp for me besides mining

The owners of LocalBitcoins must be rolling in....well...bitcoins...sort of. I know some people have had bad experiences on there but i've never had an issue in over 2 years of using their service 
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:47:35
Copay, CoinKite, Blocktrail
@_date: 2015-10-08 00:02:27
I hope Coinkite bring out an app for Android/Iphone for their multi-sig especially

I'd say the miners are a pretty good bet. 3600 new coins mined per day and i imagine a percentage of those will have to be sold in order to pay for electricity

What this says to me is that payment options like bitcoin are badly needed so that customers don't have to hand over personal information which is then stored on databases and attracts criminals
