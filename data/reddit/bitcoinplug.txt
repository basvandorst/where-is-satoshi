Makes sense, even though I don't have more than 2 addresses and none of them match. Eh whatever, as long as it shows there. Ok this event has lead me to decide to move it to bistamp and try to play around with buy/sell.

Does this also work if I tattoo it on my bum?
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:55:17
how does this help him? He said the problem was that bitcoin is volatile and the comity is strict that every participant must be paid the same amount.
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:30:00
what makes you think that?
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:45:15
High Acceptance and High value.
Edit: I don't think one can happen without the other.

I don't feel comfortable with paper, is it possible to have it on a USB?
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:50:01
woops I meant to post this in bitmarket not bitcoin....
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:52:38
if those people are large enough yes, same works around the world, 2 countries can easily control prices if they mess around and are big enough. Open economies have always been like this and will always be like this.
But bitcoin is growing, the bigger it is, the wealthier the person has to be to affect the price. Think of it as owning a % of the shares of the market, the % is always the same, however the worth of that % goes up and down depending on the total market worth.
@_date: 2014-10-18 14:02:49
came here just for this
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:49:38
why in the heck would I do such a thing? I would lose my account... For no reason..... I would never do that since I might get more ISK and want to keep you as a seller, you can have my facebook etc
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:13:14
not if you dry it.
@_date: 2014-10-18 18:22:04
he was obviously reluctant to answer this because he knew he didn't have enough knowledge.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:59:15
yea but gambling is essentially.. gambling. aren't the odds always against you?
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:08:27
I disagree, I obviously don't see blockchain being even known by the average person, but society will eventually have a technological revolution, I do believe people like snowden and loads of groups are fighting for it right now.
It will happen, it's inevitable, I believe that blockchain technology, or technologies similar to it will run in the background of most future services.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:29:41
As someone having trouble getting bitcoin for the next 2 months I'd love a copy.
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:47:16

don't gamble dude, that's sad

I thought UKIP sucks.. but this video kind of makes sense
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:35:28
I did run it, it found nothing, I use Windows 8.1 The wallet is Bitcoin Core.
Thing is, if I was compromised wouldn't they have sent all the bitcoins? why send a tiny amount? I don't understand.
Also the wallet is new and never used before, could I have messed up fees somehow?
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:25:48
saw one just like this in glasgow city centre. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:28:50
I have no idea what is happening. Oh are you giving gold out for explanations, am I too late? Oh well.
Bitcoin is good because it provides freedom of expression, freedom to innovate and freedom to control your own financial funds. These are simple points, that have never in the history of man kind been viable. With the introduction of blockchain and the rise of the Bitcoin model I think we are entering a new era of freedom.
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:03:35
Only if you are trying to be unique. If you are trying to be in the top %, then 1/1million is best
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:23:52
by borders I meant in terms of economies and innovation, imagine an era where a guy in south africa can get funding from all over the world in minutes with no fees for a project.
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:49:46
Reason you don't understand this is because it's complex mathematics.
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:36:53
Total Input	     0.0551033 BTC
Total Output	0.0551033 BTC
Fees	0 BTC
Estimated BTC Transacted	0.01 BTC
It says this.... wtf.
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:41:15
opening bitcoin core, I'll tell you now, on blockchain it's all listed under 1 transaction but to 2 addresses
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:52:56
u wot.
I genuinely believe in the good a technology like Blockchain can do, I believe that by buying bitcoin and being active within the community I can make people more aware of the technology. I don't care if bitcoin goes nowhere, my thousands of $ will still be worth it if it helps society become more open.
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:17:12
huh? What do you mean? If there are only 21 million, and 1 BTC = 1$.
That's 21 million $....
That's nothing. What if someone wants to buy a house at 2 million, that's nearly 10% of all the bitcoins. Buying that many will just drive the price up.
It cannot both be 1$ and also be used for daily transactions.
@_date: 2014-07-24 11:16:43
Isn't that the amazon logo?
@_date: 2014-10-15 11:33:38
yea nah it's fine, as long as it's there, I have decided to start trading once it's over 450$ for a continuous amount of time, if it ever gets there again.
@_date: 2014-12-31 13:00:41
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:49:25
Well I agree with the stuff he says, but I'm scared to say I agree with him because he's most likely a rapist from what I've seen/heard lately. (Obviously I'm kidding but... I've only heard horrible things about UKIP)
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:26:11
I actually told my parents, who asked me about it, not to buy since the price was volatile and they might lose it all.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:59:55
Is there a guide on how to do metal storage? I will buy one of those metal storage cards.
I am confused, how do you use the public/private key to send bitcoins? I don't know how that works, I have mine on my computer  on bitcoin core
@_date: 2014-10-15 11:14:33
yea the balance is correct. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 20:49:04
either way he was clearly uncomfortable with the question.
@_date: 2014-10-15 11:41:57
How do I deal with teams with more experience/funding trashing my company? 
Basically how do I deal with competition before my project has even commenced?
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:34:30
now that sounds interesting.
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:00:30
I'll check coinbase out thanks
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:44:52
But the total balance of my bitcoin core wallet and my blockchain wallet are now different...
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:43:04
Just loaded it, there is no transaction and my bitcoin core says I still have the bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:45:57
from my Bitcoin Core balance nothing is missing ,but if I check blockchain it says it's gone.
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:40:00
The easy way with Trezor or Ledger, are there any premium looking wallets? I am worried about these getting damaged by water or just falling. I heard there are coins and such that are fairly safe for long term storage? I could get 10 coins 10 BTC each or 20 Coins 5 BTC each.
Are these considered safe?
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:00:26
lol at all those people offering 200% PayPal payment, so legit.
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:30:02
because I'm in the UK.
@_date: 2014-11-01 23:38:43
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:44:36
yea I just did that and sent my current 10 coins there to test it out, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:28:48
Ah yea I see, meh I don't like the idea of others buying it for me since I'd like access to the accounts to have receipts etc, it's for a business.
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:32:04
yea just buying goods and reselling, how much do you have? if you have the gift cards I can buy them at a good price.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:07:13
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:45:24
not for UK codes no
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:17:19
huh? Ah I don't have the tipping thing, still trying to learn how to secure my BTC that's in a hidden USB lol.
Any good simple guides on how to Cold store?
I really really wanted to maybe buy a custom storage thing. Like some kind of sci-fi USB or a golden coin or something to cold store 20 - 30 BTC
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:38:13
What do you mean? There is no way they make more than a 10% profit. Exchanges are NOT profitable. They cost so much to run / protect, but obviously there were flaws in their security so no idea.
I would at least divide their expected revenue by 3 to have an idea of maximum profit.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:23:58
uh I use bitcoin core right now. I would never use blockchain or bitstamp or something like that.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:24:26
I am confused.. what does this have to do with anything
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:36:01
Can everyone report this video so we can take it down please?
@_date: 2015-01-17 23:18:30
1. Check printer that you printed them from, search the model and find out if it could have saved the prints
2. Put up a reward for the laptops written "The laptops are encrypted, I had really personal photos of a family member that I've lost, please help me get them back I'll pay twice what they are worth. Thank you" So the thiefs will bring them back
3. Call all local pawn shops with serial Keys and info on the laptops
4. Pay someone or put out an alert to get scripts going searching for the laptops on craigslit, ebay and other sites
5. Try see if you have any cloud services or anything enabled
That's all I can think of OP, good luck.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:32:51
that only happens if the public is aware of it. I highly doubt russian media is free enough to talk about it.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:19:53
imagine a world where it actually costs $ to run an exchange.
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:49:07
Agreed, if I had to get cold storage I would need to find a time capsule and store back ups in it and bury it somewhere haha. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:03:30
get BTC, buy clothes, free clothes.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:36:46
I meant up to +3% of market price.
Cheap as in now that the market is crashing, I'd love to get a bunch of coins when the price hits near bottom.
