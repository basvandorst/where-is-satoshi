Liquidity will be a major issue in managing such fund. I'm curious to see how they resolve this...

Nice analogy!
@_date: 2014-05-20 11:16:53
Ah OK, thanks... :)
As you can see from the first edit, this is what I suspected is the case.

Thanks, Could you please refer to my question in a comment above: does the generation of this new address invalidate the wallet backups made prior to the transaction?
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:53:27
Sure, if you just happen to have a pile of BTC that you plunk into a fund. 
Realistically, you'd need to buy that pile on an open market during subscription, and then liquidate it on Fund's maturity to pay unit holders that wish to redeem their shares.
Not sure how closed-end funds work in exotic jurisdictions (I assume this instrument will be incorporated offshore), but I'm pretty sure it involves a helluva lot of buying on inception, and at least as much selling at maturity. 
Investors in such funds will potentially be exposed to a massive liquidity risk, possibly even larger than current individual BTC holders. As a risk manager at an asset management company, I am genuinely curious how they intend to manage that risk.

I think that they are simply arrogantly ignorant.

Brilliant, thanks... 
What do you mean when you say hat I should have the key to 19a? 
Are those funds available to me regardless of the fact that I don't see this address in the Bitcoin Core? 
The wiki says:


This could be a good moment to ask a few related questions: 
- How are balances of all those addresses consolidated (i.e. how can I keep track of all the addresses that get generated by transactions,and is that neccessary)?
- Let's say I back-up my wallet. Is that a snapshot of that wallet in that point in time, and do I need to make a backup every time that I make a new transaction (in order to capture those new change addresses), or the backup of my wallet makes sure I have access to all the addresses that get generated in the future?
Sorry if the questions seem silly, but I'm quite a noob when it comes to practicalities of transacting with BTC...

Yeah, what caused the confusion is the fact that I've mistook *addresses* as the equivalent for *accounts*. 
I'm using Baseline iOS app to track my basic addresses, and up until now I did not realise that they are an equivalent of sub-accounts. So when I saw that I've transacted 0.001 BTC and ended up missing 0.01 BTC, I got confused... :)
What I did not realise was the fact that this balance (change) appeared on an address that I'm not tracking in Baseline...

But isn't difficulty irreversible?

Looks like BTC is crashing badly... MtGox seems to be under a lot of pressure, I can't even load it...
@_date: 2011-06-16 08:57:16
Really? That's cool. It kind of balances out then...
@_date: 2011-09-11 20:20:09
Bought the app, very nice!
@_date: 2011-06-15 07:38:41
Thanks, didn't realize the difference is that vast.
But was the Phenom in the separate rig or the same one?
