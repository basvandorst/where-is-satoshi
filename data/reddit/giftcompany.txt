As a shopowner and ticketbroker for atractions and owner of the giftcompany i am willing to start up as good as possible at openbazaar. Ofcourse there are obstacles and there will be all kinds of startup problems or maybe a few. But the main thing here is to buld something completely new. And more important something completely trustworhty and healthy. For that you need people who wants to invest time.knowledge and money to achieve a new state of economy and trade. Everyone who is adding up to a project like this will look back in 20 years and know that you were a part of it. Maybe it will become something maybe it will become nothing. But i know one thing. Complainers will achieve nothing and dreamers sometime will live their dream. Therefore i want to contibute with a shop a soon it is possible and help to build a great platform. Not dor the money but just because i can and want to.
This message is for the more negative thinkers.
Best regards to everybody
