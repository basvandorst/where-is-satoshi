No, not really David. 
Bitcoin is a way better payment system than the fiat-biggyback model of Paypal.
I can make a payment to anyone in the world without needing to verify my identity, and I already do it all the time. That, in itself, makes Bitcoin a superior currency.
Sure, Bitcoin is also a great store of value too, but that's just icing on the cake.
"Whenever the regulatory framework is clearer, and the volatility comes down, then we'll consider it."
What you don't realize is that by the time Paypal makes this move, Bitcoin's price stability means it will have already taken over a significant market share in the payment processing area. Companies who adopt early will put Paypal out of business.

As a reminder, when someone brings up the alt-alt currency argument of, "You can make/clone as many of these alt currencies as you want, we don't even know if Bitcoin will be the one to make it in the future.", let them know that Bitcoin is a melting pot, open-source system, and the good parts of other alt coins can be pulled into Bitcoin's source code. In fact, this process helps to keep Bitcoin safe in that these variations make for good testing environments before being combined with Bitcoin. So being first here really was the most important in terms of market capitalization. Bitcoin will constantly adapt to become the most dominant currency in the future, and may not even be the same system as we know it today, however all the wealth that was moved into this new digital system can remain.
The other argument of intrinsic value is unfair. Bitcoin HAS intrinsic value. In addition to being an awesome payment processing system (and all the benefits that come with it), decentralized store of wealth, backed by millions of people, secured by 10+ petahashes of computer processing around the world... THE PEOPLE are in control of this system, and changes to its constitution (source code) can only be accepted democratically, not by a central authority!

It was one of the most awesome things I've done in a while :-D
It was $10 more than buying directly from the actual airline, but the BTC/USD price they used (coinbase) was based off of bitstamp's, so I felt like I was getting an even better deal at the time. Besides, I PAYED IN BTC! :)

If it gets to a point where this is reasonable...
**Seriously.** 
This is what will happen. This is how we vote on policy changes.
However, we do not, yet, have an alternative implemenation that will resolve this specific problem. If and when we do, oh hell yes -- fork away (if that is required) -- but until then, it makes no difference.
What we SHOULD do (in the meantime) is request, as a community, that EVERY person or company that accepts bitcoin publicly post that they are AGAINST "blacklisting" or "redlisting" or whatever... and that we will ONLY use their services if they do so.

Before alt-coins succeed, Bitcoin must first fight the good fight against the dollar and other fiat currencies. That means a concentration of wealth in crypto-currencies must, and will, be into Bitcoin. Remember, there isn't just one digital currency right now, there are dozens, and the dollar is the biggest of them all. If Bitcoin defeats the dollar and takes over the world, then I can see alt-coins making an impact in certain areas. Until then, yes, early adopters into Bitcoin will become "ridiculously" wealthy, and I can't wait.
I don't think you are wrong, but the timing for this event is too far in the future and betting on it happening now would mean missing an opportunity in Bitcoin's amazing near-term growth.

Finally, a better perspective ;-) 
I would have to agree that the stated "restrictions" were influenced more by their ongoing capital crisis, as opposed to the fear of Bitcoin's future success as an alternative currency, yes. 
It just seems like a way more realistic perspective for why they bothered at all.
However, would I go on further to (and you aren't OP, but some others here may) say that China's statements were the cause of bitcoin's recent price declines? 
This won't be a popular opinion, but I actually wouldn't 
A better perspective would be that bitcoin had reached gold oz parity -- a huge psychological point of resistance for Bitcoin traders -- who tested to break though it, leading to a double top, failed, and consequently sold en mass. Long-term, broad analysis also leads me to believe that the timing of this was in line with a global capital crisis, so people are beginning to cash out to more secure assets across the board. Perhaps, certain Chinese citizens were utilizing Bitcoin to prepare for that. 
On the other hand, it would seem more likely that there were actually very few Chinese users at BTCchina, since it could have realistically been largely US Bitcoiners taking advantage of 0% trading fees. If true, it would lend credibility to the gold parity theory, since the Chinese news would have no effect on US traders who always withdraw in BTC.
If someone could get BTCchina data and confirm the latter statement, that'd be great.
2014 will be interesting, regardless.

**pyramid/ponzi/bigger idiot scheme**
If this isn't you being negative, then you must be an idiot.
No one comes to looking for negative opinions like yours. It's like a foreigner going to a different country and shouting how horrible it is, while all the natives are completely happy and understand exactly what both countries are like. If you don't like it, you didn't need to go in the first place. No one cares or even wants to hear your biased crap anyway. You may not be a "devious shiller", but you're certainly annoying as hell.
Oh, or a troll... that's more likely :)

Nice site!
To reiterate, the two biggest issues in general are:
1. "In theory, Trent can conspire with Alice to split the funds fifty-fifty and leave Bob with nothing"
2. "Trent will contact Alice and Bob to gather evidence from both of them, and adjudicate the dispute."
The first one can be mitigated effectively by using high-rated, trusted intermediaries. So sure, it could be an issue, but that risk decreases as credibility grows. Not a big issue if you've got some very credible and knowledgeable people listed as agents.
However, the second issue is a real problem when dealing with transactions where all three parties aren't physically present. Trent can only gather as much information that Alice and Bob are willing to give, and both could completely falsify their facts to support a personal claim.
The main concern here isn't damage, it's trying to weigh the evidence for a claim regarding wrong or defective items. To reduce this type of risk, both parties can pay to have Alice ship the item directly to Trent first in order to inspect and verify the fulfillment of their contract (make sure its the actual thing ordered). Then, if there are any "shipping damages" to the item at any point between the three, it will be handled by insurance purchased through the shipping company by both parties.
Once all of these precautions are taken into consideration, the only major risk left comes down to the decision of who handles the escrow position (Trent), as their opinion and judgment in a dispute will play the ultimate role. The good thing is that both parties must come to agree on who that person is BEFORE the transaction is made. So really, all the responsibility is on them.
I like this particular model because Alice and Bob can go around Trent if need be (very important), the cost will be relative to the level of verification needed by both parties, and asking for a particular kind of escrow will deter fraud. If it's an expensive physical item, then both parties (if they're honest and smart) should agree to pay a premium on the escrow/shipping to transact. If the physical item is cheap, maybe not so much.
