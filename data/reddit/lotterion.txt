Wasn't me though..
I also have an older reddit account which i didn't want to use to advertise the site because providing the service could be.. legally challenging in my country ;)

That depends on the height of your stake, obviously.
Given a stake of 0.1BTC and a transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC, the transaction fee would amount to 5% and you would get 95%. 
This is not my doing though but the transaction fee of the network..
@_date: 2013-07-22 10:35:32
No, i really am not sending back less than 100%. I'm sending back exactly 100%. Nothing is left in the account afterwards.
I don't charge the transaction fee - the bitcoin network charges it.
@_date: 2013-07-22 09:59:29
No, it really is ;)
The full amount of your stake less the transaction fee is being send to your address.
What do you mean with the current jackpot? There is no jackpot which is filled over the time of multiple drawings as each drawing is payed out when it ends.

No, i actually cant. There is a minimal transaction fee for small transactions.
If i were trying to (which is not even possible with the official bitcoind) avoid the fee, theres a good chance the transactions will never be included in any block and the coins are basically gone..

Thats exactly what i'm doing


Also what i'm doing. If you would be interested (i somehow have the feeling you are not ;) you could test it for yourself by participating and seeing that your winning is payed out.
Sure, if you're not willing to bring a small amount of initial trust upfront when staking a few satoshis, this is not possible for you.
And thats ok.. If you are that highly averse of a risk, you are probably not in the target audience for a lottery.


You somehow fail to mention what systems that may be
@_date: 2013-07-22 10:27:35
No, he is not right. In case of a refund, i send 100% of your stake to your address.
You can't really be surprised that these transactions are affected by the same transaction fees as all other bitcoin transactions..
@_date: 2013-07-22 08:06:21
Thats true of basically every lottery system, don't you think?
What should i do / change in the process to build trust without going through the process of building a good reputation first?
@_date: 2013-07-22 07:41:20
Fair point ;)
If i were you, I would definitely start out with a rather small stake and see what it gets me..
When a drawing ends, all transaction ids of all payouts will be made public so if i were to participate myself, i would at least have to go through the trouble of using a bitcoin mixer every time prior to sending in my stake.
I was hoping the winners (especially the winners of the high stakes) would share their success with the community, so i would be able to gain more trust with time..
Edit: I think "Putting in some BTC myself" is exactly, what i should not do. You would have no way of knowing if i did it at an early point in the drawing, or close to the end after figuring out which stake would give me a pleasing return..
I would rather try to gain trust and get some long-term returns in form of the 1% which is not payed out than to discourage the players because nobody is never winning anything.. :)

I'm not trying to by nitpicking, but i fail to see where i said that
@_date: 2013-07-22 08:45:42
Why not? Being the first player brings the same risk as joining when others are already in. Again, you can bet an arbitrarily small amount (although something higher than the transaction fee makes sense). If one really winds up as the single player of the drawing, the stake is automatically being refunded..
@_date: 2013-07-22 09:42:29


Sure, that's my point and that's what i'm trying to do :) Until that happens, you have surely no reason to trust the site and believe me, i'm not expecting somebody to invest a high amount before that.
But tbh. i don't really get your hate.. so far i don't think you have a specific reason to mistrust the site based on the fact that it *could* be dishonest.


I'm not expecting you to do anything. I just wondered what you meant when you implied that there is a way of gaining immediate provable trust without building reputation.. because i don't see it :)


What do you mean by that? I'm not sure how these things compare to a lottery. Especially seeing how google's algorithms are not exactly open..


Maybe i should describe my thought better:
By betting an even amount (say 1BTC), there is a much higher chance for having to share your return with another player who also bet 1BTC. If you were to bet for example 1.043 or 0.993 BTC, this event is way more unlikely.
