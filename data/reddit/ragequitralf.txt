I' still have majority of my portfolie in bitcoin because I beleive one "king" crypto is better for mainstream adoption than having dozens of them confusing merchants which one to adopt. 
In my opinion the developement should be focused on fixing the first layer. Second layer can be a nice option but not if the first one is broken. Bitcoin could maybe just look at altcoins that work and then imitating the things that work. To be honest, I was never a fan of chaning anything about Bitcoin but maybe it's better to change something than totally losing ground. I hate seeing ripple doing well, I thought bitcoin was inventend to "destroy" banks and now bitcoin fans are switching to ripple.

To my knowledge the light bulb was not an open source project and there was no light bulb subreddit where you could talk about what to improve. So what you're saying is people should not even talk about how to improve it because that's only up to the developer. If that's the case we'd have to wait for satoshi coming back to fix it.

I'm not a software developer, just an average person. I did some research on bitcoin/blockchain but I'm certainly not an expert so if I miss any points making the proposal impossible please let me know.

I highly respect developers, people who can develop complex software like bitcoin are like supermen in my opinion but the bitcoin is not only a software model but mainly an economic model and to understand the economic model there are no coding skills needed, these are needed to implement the model into code later on. Afaik Vitalik argues to switch to PoS with etherum, so if you say only developers' opinion are import, maybe he can convince you.

Paypal is superior to bitcoin. Low and stable fees, instant transfers, widely accepted for payments and you can use currencies that aren't volatile like € or $.

Nothing has really changed as block space is still limited, so more usage means fees will go up again.
24h is also very slow.

Which three letter sub do you mean? Can you name it for clarification please?

It's not a fake, they have just a different view on the scaling dabate, which is totally fine. Let's be peaceful, stop the attacks and simply let the market decide what the better scaling solution is.

Bitcoin cash isn't "stealing value" from btc. You can't "steal" in a free market, you can only compete and BTC only dropped in market share because the fees went too high, so that many people that aren't extremely rich weren't able to use it anymore and switched to alts.
I agree with you in many points. I don't like the way Roger markets bitcoin cash. However, you can't really complain if you call bitcoin cash "bcash" yourself as this is equally and confusing misleading, because bcash is a fork of zcash. 
The ongoing war isn't helping either side but harms both. All would do better if we just stopped it and called bitcoin bitcoin and bitcoin cash bitcoin cash. No bitcoin core, no bcash, etc.. Both sides are way too aggressive in my opinion. There are no winners in a war.

Unlike bitcoin, street signs are not open source, so you should buy own signs instead of damaging others' property.

"the intrinsic value created by the expectation of the community"
Am I the only one who's thinking this is highly paradoxial?
