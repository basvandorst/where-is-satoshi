Well yeah, they wanted 10k bitcoin, they are getting it right here.

He will never down right say to buy Bitcoin or support Bitcoin because its not in the best interests of America, but him acknowledging Bitcoin as a competitor is HUUGE for Bitcoin.

LOL people can barely handle a 9k dip, I bet by next year 9k dips will become regular....like going from 250k to 240k back up to 260k.
It will be nothing.
HECK we will see 20k dips one day.

@_date: 2017-12-22 23:42:42






I still believe it reaches 20-25k before new year, this correction/sell off was needed.
This was all done in preparation for the Christmas boom. The big sellers sold in order to get the weak hands to sell theirs, they bought all of them back up and now have many more BTC heading into the holidays.
They will also begin to surge the price heading into Christmas, when people see 20k bitcoin in 3 days, they will feel impulse to buy, especially on Christmas, its all design folks.

Perhaps, I will say this though, two things happened, it bounced off the down trend line that it had broke, and it also bounced off the new upward trend line from the previous two lows. If it does hold here its a good sign.
The charts are much different obviously this time vs 2013-2015, we have a quadruple bottom, the last time it only hit bottom once, and there was no quadruple or triple bottom at any point.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:26:36

And for people will dispute this, I undertstand, I do.
But the absolute Best thing for the whales is to get more people involved than possible. 
You think people are going to be talking about Bitcoin on Christmas if it crashes? Heck no, it would be borderline embarrassing, that is the last thing these guys want, they want everyone talking about Bitcoin and how much money the have made. 
Just look at the charts, it's a complete shakedown, and they knew 10k was the bottom for people like us would probably start buying in.
This is going to be the most entertaining week ever, we might just see Bitcoin go from 19k to 10k to potentially 20-25k and perhaps even 30k. If Bitcoin hysteria takes over again, the prices might not stop.
Coinbase is expecting 2 million new users? Hopefully their site works, and as Much as we hate coinbase right now, if they get their shit straight in these few days, we will all be very happy.

They got the cash back which was an agreed price I believe of $320.. 
But, they now are going to be getting some of their bitcoin back, its going to get divided based on fair percentages.
My whole point is, that while I feel bad for all of the Mt Gox people who lost their BTC, there is NO CHANCE that 100% of them would have held onto their Bitcoin as bitcoin reached prices levels of $1000, $2000, $5000, $10000, $20000.......Some may have held, but the majority in my opinion would not have. So while many feel they have lost out on $1000s of dollars, a lot of them would have sold in 2016, and early 2017.
Its a shitty situation obviously so Im not trying to downplay their losses either.
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:22:39
When we went from like 4k to 20k there was so much fud and it didn't matter.
People make a big deal about fud and good news. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:50:05
In 2015 it was worth as low as $2000.  In a way they are HODLing for him.
Its like the MT Gox people, alot of them lost a lot of Bitcoin however a lot of them would have sold if Bitcoin got back to $1000, however now its at $6000 and was 20k
It could just be a blessing in disguise, if he gets it back.
@_date: 2019-11-17 00:07:39
I'm not saying it Will break it but we have moved faster this time, it would make sense that after we break 14k we get rejected at 20k then breakthrough after the halving

I use cointracker to link to your exchange and Wallets, it updates your amount automatically.
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:02:15
Thats why I think its hilarious there are people who are bearish (they are only bearish because of the price). Look at what the halving hype did for Litecoin......I think we will see Bitcoin run up to $20k again prior to the halving, maybe peak, then get rejected. Last time a month prior the halving Bitcoin peaked, so perhaps in April or late March we see $20,000 again before going back down for a little while.

Washington post has been predicting the stock market crash since the moment Trump hit 270 electoral votes.
The trade wars were supposed to crash it, the investigation was supposed to crash it, etc. Etc. 
At this point everyone is saying the stock market will crash, and it hasn't.... In 2008 no one was predicting a market crash and then it happened. The more I hear about the market crash the more confident I get that it, won't happen in the next few years, if no one is predicting it then I would be worried.

The moment it hit 8k, It surged up to 20k in days..... People view 50k as some huge number, far off and I agree, but Imagine the amount of fomo we would see if we broke 20k? 
When we break 20k we will be at 25k-30k within a few days time.

Bitcoin going to a million dollars is inevitable, of course it wont happen overnight, and a million dollars might not be as much as it is today when it does happen, however it will reach it.
People holding .1 BTC, 1 BTC, 10, 100 BTC are increasing
People holding Bitcoin are holding it longer and longer
Based on this alone, if demand remains the same,  inflation decreases after halvening, price must go up

@_date: 2019-08-06 05:47:23
I know that feeling exactly from 2017. This time around I have much higher goals so despite nearly getting back to where I was in 2017 in regards to USD worth, it doesn't excite me as much, which leads me to not checking as often. At the end of the day, I am very confident Bitcoin will end up at 100k-400k within 2 or 3 years, thats when the real excitement will begin for me.
However I am nervous to, because we could see Bitcoin run from say 100k to 300k in a matter of weeks like how we went from 8k to 20k in about 3 weeks. So the time to execute something you waited years to do, will be a small window in the big picture.
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:42:18






Exactly, what if you invest 100&amp; of your money into Bitcoin, then proceed to trade bitcoin with Alts and make profit.  Now you owe taxes in USD, yet you dont own a single USD. 
You shouldnt be required to carry USD if you dont want to. Also when you go to convert to USD to pay the taxes that TRIGGERS another taxable event because you are being "forced" to convert to USD. Its time for the government to start accepting any &amp; all crypto or just stop taxing crypto-crypto trades.

That would be more of a reason, if you had a million dollars and are wealthy, why would want to lose $5000 by keeping your money in the bank.....? There has to be a point where you will take that money and store it elsewhere. Perhaps not all of it, but even taking 10% is a huge deal.
No wealthy person is going to sit there and watch their money bleed after watching it grow their entire life. They will put it into something like real estate or metals or crypto. It's common sense.

Litecoin is cheaper fees because its not as popular as Bitcoin, if Litecoin got as big as Bitcoin it would be the same amount (from what I understand).
Regardless, not trying to promote litecoin but its worth taking a look at, especially with the LTC-BTC atomic swap.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:01:09
In about 2 weeks (or less) we should be at 10k, it will proceed with a dip back down to 9000ish that will last a few days, proceed by a run to 12K over the final couple weeks of December.
Also the geniuses on here will say I just drew lines, and yep thats exactly what I did, I drew lines, because thats exactly what this is. Lines.

Here is another guy, who sold his house and put it all in litecoin when litecoin was between $4-$10, and now is $55 today.
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:04:41
Sometimes the fees are worth it in a bull market. For example, Bitcoin was below $9000 when I did my bank transfer to coinbase pro a few days back....im still waiting for that money to come in. Now bitcoin is essentially at 10k, paying the fees would have been the better option at $9000.
Now when my money does arrive, I may wait for a pullback, but it might not pullback immediately.
TBH though, DCA is proven to be successful so its still a winning situation, I dont personally try to time the market that much, I bought at $6000, and I also bought at $3000, and bought back at $6000, either way I won as of today.

They tried their hardest to pour money out of Bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin dipped around 25% while BTCash rose around like 300-500%. They expected to create a death spiral, they also flooded boards and forums proclaiming that BTCash is the future and the better coin, etc.

Just over 2 grand, but thats was only from the last few weeks on Bitcoin.
Nothing special, just saying, the last 3 times I bought in, it never looked back. Just feel like we are going to 8k or 9k before the fork. (We saw 7.5k last night so we will get back there soon).
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:48:12
Its in two weeks, i wouldnt be worried, but we could see a dip after the fork, (people are buying in because if you own bitcoin you will receive "free" segwit 2 x (A new coin). (Im not the genius on forks though, probably have to talk to smarter people on this subreddit).
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:19:46
I would take the over to, I actually believe it could be more close to 225-250 than 200......

@_date: 2017-11-01 12:12:34
Yes considering, just since August alone the market cap of bitcoin went from 55 Billion to nearly 110 Billion today.....at the rate its going, it could be at 100k within two years or less.  (think about it, in the last 3 months alone, more money has poured in than in the previous 8 years combined.......)
It just depends, its hotter than ever and may continue to get even hotter. 100k could come sooner than any of us may even think (Next year perhaps).
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:26:54
Yep and its just Math to me, and I think now we are reaching the point where people are no beginning to accept bitcoin and are realizing its here to stay.
The best surge has yet to come imo. (I believe we could see a surge from like 10k to 25k in a very small time span.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:02:34
I know im looking right now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:55:35
Isn't it believed that most these exchanges only hold 80% of what they actually should be holding? They sell more than what they actually have but people who leave their crypto on there, allows them to do that.
Because when the forks happen they seem to run into trouble because they dont actually have as much bitcoin as they are reporting so they dont get reward the fork coin.......

How are you supposed to get money to venmo if you don't have a bank account? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:20:59
Yes but, but lets say we reach a point where BTC is universally accepted as a payment method, more and more people will be inclined to move more and more of their fiat to BTC.
Spending it will gets its price to rise quicker. Like if amazon started accepting it tomorrow, their are many folk who would feel comfortable about turning their USD into BTC because they would be able to purchase what they typically purchase at the click of a button.

At the rate we are going, we will be 100k by 2019.

Crazy people still believe it though.
@_date: 2019-04-14 21:49:56
Its definitely true, when I was a newbie back in 2014-2015 I didnt buy Bitcoin because I feared it would crash again. Once Bitcoin passed $1200, I started to gain confidence in it, and then when it got past $2000 I realized it was time.
The other thing is, a lot of newbies view $20,000 as a number Bitcoin might never get to again, a lot of people are unaware of the potential that Bitcoin could hit $100k, $250k etc......so until Bitcoin at least passes $20,000 and goes past it, such as $30,000, then people will gain confidence, it will give them verification that Bitcoin is on the rise and blew past the impossible number of $20,000. I know because I was in these peoples shoes a few years ago, I honestly though Bitcoin would never reach $1200 again, but I was a newbie, I didn't know what a market cap was, I didnt understand the limited supply, the halving, none of it, all I knew was that Bitcoin got to $1200 and came down, and that $1200 number felt so far away, the same way people view $20,000 as a pipe dream now.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:16:13
It doesn't feel like 2017, it feels like 2015, this reminds me exactly of 2015 when Bitcoin was sitting at $200, and the moved up, it feels the same.
The Parabolic move is still a year away, at least, I do believe this is another four year cycle so mid 2021 is when the fun will begin.

Why because there are currently only 10 million people in this world who own bitcoin. If that number reaches 100 million or even 20 million the demand will be higher.

I like Schiff but even just a month ago he started claiming he was right, and now he looks really bad.
Whats crazy is, people tried selling bitcoin to schiff at $2, $20, $100, and he never bought in. He must feel like he made a mistake.

Its on coinmarketcap, I have to find it, but you can see how many wallets there are in the entire world that have bitcoin in them. You can check other coins to.....
I was watching a guy on youtube go through them all so I saw it all myself. (obviously everything with crpyto is public)
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:23:56
Why because there are currently only 10 million people in this world who own bitcoin. If that number reaches 100 million or even 20 million the demand will be higher.
China is manipulating the price, they know more than anyone that bitcoin is the future and they will be the last ones to get left behind. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:42:41
I think if it is at 20k, its more likely it hits 50k then crashes down to 6k. It always potentially could but it would hit 6k for like an hour and be back up with hours/days.

Peter Schiff has been completely wrong and continues to completely wrong. He just keeps hyping up the "impending collapse", well in 5 years from now, when the collapse still hasn't happened, I hope Schifts just admits he was wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:33:22
No offense but some of you sound stupid.
Only like 0.001% of the world owns Bitcoin and its $6k, so if 0.01% own bitcoin it would probably be at $100k, heck it probably won't require that much more people getting involved anyway, just more investments from countries and banks does the trick....
It probably does head to a million within 10 years, nothing is stopping it, it would have happened already if it were to crash, it would have died when Mt Gox went down. The only thing stopping it now is if the whole power grid gets shut down from a solar flare....

Im in my mid 20s and put about 40% in, I dont care if I lose it all, to me its my one chance at a "gamble", Im very picky with my money and have saved a decent amount. I can make it back anyway, what I cant ever make back is the potential Bitcoin has. If Bitcoins ends up at 100k+ in a few years, it will take YEARS to make that back, what I lose now, I can make back in months if I honestly had to (which I dont). 
But I also firmly believe in BTC and understand it better than I ever have. Its doing what the internet did to the library, and what email did to the post office, and what digital streams are doing to the cable companies.

"Bitcoin trade in Japanese yen accounted for nearly 46 percent of global trade volume, up from about a third a day ago, according to CryptoCompare. US-dollar bitcoin trade accounted for about 25 percent, according to CryptoCompare. Bitcoin trade in Chinese yuan and South Korean won accounted for about 12 percent each.
The surge picked up speed in the last week, mirroring gold's climb amid a global selloff in stocks and bonds. Rising worries about North Korea's nuclear threat have sent investors flocking to perceived safe-havens and alternative assets.
"Bitcoin is benefitting from geopolitical tensions - trading in Japan and Korea has increased significantly over the last few months," Brian Kelly, a CNBC contributor and head of BKCM, which runs an digital asset strategy, said in an email. He also attributed price gains to investors buying back bitcoin after the Aug. 1 split and greater attention from the Russian government."

I used to view Bitcoin as a huge risk, but I realized recently it is not a risk at all. The only thing stopping Bitcoin is another cryptocurrency taking its spot, but I still feel it would not crush bitcoin either.
Other than that, Bitcoin has survived Mt Gox, China fake ban, etc
When only like .001% of the population owns bitcoin and its at 6k, it makes you realize where this thing can potentially go. I predict in 2018 we will see Bitcoin gain 200-500% of where it is now.

You are correct, I go to other internet forums, and if I even bring Bitcoin up, either:
A) people have no clue what I am talking about
B) people think its a scam and I need to go away
Now in real life when I attempt to explain it to my friends who are in their 20s/30s who use the internet 24/7, play video games, etc. they don't understand it and dont trust it, but trust the banks.....
So forget Grandparents and soccer moms buying Bitcoin, Millennial's who have grown up using the internet still aren't in the game yet

Im not saying we don't need a government, but why don't you look at what happens when government has to much control.....tell me how that has worked out in history.
We don't need a government that controls our schools or roads, just like how the government doesn't choose which car I drive.
Actually your response is completely ignorant, I never said no government at all. Who will pay for the police, fire department, courts? the tax payers who will pay their taxes in Satoshis. But we don't need the government to inflate a currency to pay for things, we will live in a world where the government won't be able to control our lives and determine such things. People can build roads and schools, we DO NOT need the government to do so and they wont have the ability to, because they won't be able to inflate their currency to do such projects. Schools under the government are costly and inefficient, most government projects cost way more and are completed in a non-timely manner.

It probably is near the bottom, doesnt mean its going back up though.
In 2015, Bitcoin sat in the $200s from January to October, 10 months before it broke $300.
Its possible we sit between $6000-$9000 for 10 months.
So far we have been in that range since early May, so 2 months. We may have 8 more months before we crack $9000.......which would be around February-March of next year.

I believe we could be at 20K+ by years end still. Last year we went from 8k to 20k in a matter of 3 weeks, if we break the downtrend right here, that could theoretically happen again. I dont expect it to however when it takes off like that people kinda hold off on selling to see where it goes. 
With the ETF thing coming, it does seem to be coming in timely manner. Things can change quickly, both ways, as we all know.

He actually predicted (in 2014) Bitcoin would hit $10k in 2017.  
He also bought millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin when Bitcoin was $600, it proceeded to go down to $200, he was confident in his investment.
He now predicts Bitcoin to hit $250k by 2022-2023.

I would Wait to hit $8100, however it's honestly not a bad time, it's way passed the trend line so  I don't see it dropping down that much if it does, and if it does it will come back up anyway in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:35:46
Yeah we are, so lets see if it breaks it or not.
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:55:03
My opinion, no I would not buy bitcoin right now, we are approaching the long term down trend line which is at $8000 dollars, if bitcoin breaks it, I would buy, however if it fails to break it we could possibly see it go back down to 5.8k again.
I would wait to see if it does breakthrough before buying, if it does break 8k it could easily reach 8.5k+ or 9k on the same day.

We dont need the government to create schools, hospitals or even roads. We can live in a world with less government involvement. We can live in a world where roads are decentralized, schools are decentralized.
If I want to buy a road with Bitcoin, I will buy road with Bitcoin. Then If I want to charge someone to drive on my road, they can pay to in Bitcoin. Sounds a lot better than the government taxing us, and then inflating the currency to build roads, everything can be decentralized instead.

HOWEVER Bitcoin will far exceed 30x, so while these people lose everything, we will gain everything.

Honestly thats my biggest fear, I know people who bought in during 2014, 2015, held to 2017, and then cashed out at $2000 because they feared a crash......obviously it went up to $20,000 and they could have made a hell of a lot more.

This bull market is looking more like 2012 than 2015. In the 2015 bull market, Bitcoin 16x from its all time high. It's likely that Bitcoin will exceed 16x so perhaps we see a 20x move from 20k, we would be looking at a $400,000 bitcoin at the top if this keeps up.
It also means we will reach 20k sooner than when we reach 1.2k
