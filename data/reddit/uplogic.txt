No coincidence. **One of the authors of bettermeans answerd to this on Quora:** 
[BetterMeans: How does BetterMeans compare to Pivotal Tracker?](
TL;DR: They were heavily inspired by Pivotal tracker.

I hate to say that, but the whole video is pure marketing. I don't want to down your motivation, but there must be a reason why the product failed, despite the good promotional video linked here. Project Management tools blossom and SaaS solutions spread around like a wild-fire. Really just goto  and see for yourself just how many solutions exist. And alternativeto.net doesn't list most of the newly available SaaS startups that try to solve the same problem by providing just another copycat solution with a slightly different UI.
**The real video starts at about 1:55 and what it shows is just a ['Scrum']( with Votes.** You can create the same in javascript in a day (that doesn't mean that it wold be any better btw.). All the "back-end" crap is needless. This is a) not scalable (you can try to scale ruby, good luck) b) it's another dedicated and central platform c) it's insecure by design d) there is no mathematical proof that shows the validity of the implemented models, other than some fixtures and unit-tests.
A real solution is to extend the original bitcoin client with this functionality and to solve it without polluting the blockchain. You need create a mathematical domain model (peer reviewed if possible) that can guarentee for the integrity and authenticity of actions, votes, offers. Also you need to find a way that identifies voters, voting-rings, manipulaiton etc. There are solutions to each, that I know of from various papers, but it's not possible to put that into code in one month, if you're alone.

Share your wisdom in a tutorial, there sure are newbies who need this.

A verily "unorthogox" decision that is.

Who won?

hmm, that's not different than Secret Sharing (Shamir's Secret Sharing) combined with Zero-Knowledge-Proofs, or does Bitcoin work using different concepts?

Can I take part at this? (I wish I could submit a solution/demo in 3months, because that's also how long my local deadlines are, otherwise I've to pass this to people who can dedicate a full month for it. Sorry, I'm poor, I can't work a full month on it neglecting everything else.)
**Sir, I think it would be a good thing, if you asked everyone to submit a scientific one-page project proposal** to you. Therefore people could understand why one particular group won. A groups proposal, even if mediocre doesn't mean the resulting project won't be stellar and vice-versa. Also creating multiple prizes instead of one grand prize is more motivating. I have read studies about this and the consensus is that usually you cannot buy great work with great money, but with great inspiration or motivation only. This requires positive feedback loops, which small $50-$200 prices could achieve. If a group reached a milestone that was set for example.
Would you mind giving more info about the 1month deadline? Was it arbitary, or has it a financial or political cue it's attached to? If so, how could the problem be reduced to solve 'that' exclusively.
I have a project assignment to a compsci masters course in **cryptology and system security**, where I shall propose a **"Secure and trustable solution to group and inter-group communication"**. [Fully Homomorphic Encryption](
Then I also have another project assignment to a **security modeling** course, where the topic is still in the open. I could choose to solve the create a secure model that solves the [**Paradox of Voting**]( and creates a system with an computer-aided socially compatible [Voting System]( The problem here is that you need to find a secure mathematical model and create a solution out of that solves multiple domain theoretic probems.
I hate to create projects that don't solve actual problems, therefore I'm looking to find another cause I can cover with my course assignements and client requests (am also freelancing). // Btw.: I'm transparent about what I do to clients and professors. 
The trojan horse I'm hiding in here is that I believe that this "could" also replace the established systems the government uses, given enough personal incentive and promotion, hehe.
