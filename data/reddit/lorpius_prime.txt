Being able to save "in stable currencies outside of the government's reach" is not the problem.  Merchants are *forced* to sell their goods at below-market prices by the Venezuelan government.  They aren't making enough money to maintain inventories, which is causing shortages.  Telling merchants that they should accept Bitcoin won't change that; I'm sure plenty of them would *love* to take Bitcoins, just as much as they'd love to accept any other hard currency out there.  But what most of their customers actually *have* are Bolivars, and a government willing to impose price controls.

Do you consider it "smart spending" when people put their money in a box rather than investing it?  Because deflation makes that a profitable savings strategy.

So in the economics portion of your education, did they actually neglect to teach you why deflation is socially undesirable, or do you just think you have some reason to disregard that lesson?

And surging demand doesn't mean that suppliers *have* to raise their prices.  But they do.
Deflation *will* reduce investment, because it makes *not* investing profitable.  If deflation is actually *expected,* the reduction will be even greater, because it creates *risk-free* returns for not-investing.
Bitcoins are an interesting economic experiment.  Their technical specs may have a lot of contributions to make to improving future exchange methods.  They may even be useful in their own right as a highly-liquid asset (especially if they displace the asset value of commodities like gold).  But any asset which continuously appreciates makes for a terrible *currency.*

I don't believe you understand Venezuela's problems if you think there's much room for Bitcoin to make a positive difference.  Venezuelans would benefit from a different currency, sure, but *any* stable currency would do the trick, and it would be a whole lot easier for them to use a currency with physical bills like USD or EUR than an intangible one like BTC.  And it's not like they don't know or can't get alternative currencies, it's that the Venezuelan government *forces* them to use Bolivars for many transactions, but has been ruinously inflating the currency for some time.  There's nothing Bitcoin can do about Venezuelan police or party thugs telling shopkeepers "you *must* sell your goods at these prices in our currency".

No, people invest where their expected return overcomes their risk aversion.  That has very little connection to investing where it's "necessary" from any sort of social perspective.  Inflation is a tool used by currency managers to try to align investment preferences with the public interest by increasing the risk of hoarding currency.  If people always invested in optimal patterns of their own accord, we would never experience systemic catastrophes like recessions or liquidity crunches.


People who *already have* cash can afford a decrease in investing in a deflationary environment.  The rest of the economy suffers because less is made available for lending.


Yeah... would you like to explain *that* nugget of wisdom?  How is stuffing cash under the mattress an "investment" in *anything?*


If you think people consume too much then tax consumption!  Deflating money just sucks value out of the economy and rewards anyone who makes an active choice to literally contribute *nothing* to society.  Seriously, the entire point of markets is that trade makes people better off; but deflation throws a wrench into the fundamental workings of markets by encouraging the *refusal* to trade.
