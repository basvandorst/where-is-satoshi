you should invest only what you can afford to loose guys
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:59:47
you are right!
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:09:50
buy high sell low
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:55:06
In a few days imho
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:41:04
Will be back to 19k soon
Also eth and LTC are pimping
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:25:07
When do I need to pay taxes? When I move BTC to $ in coinbase or when I move out $ from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:55:02
Love your nick, asshole :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:43:56
I did a panic sell at 14,5k then seen BTC going to 10,5k, then back to 14,5k and bought again :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:23:19
it is a ROTFL
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:52:16
You are correct, but what is changing if I sell and then buy at the same price?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:59:39
Looks like will go under 10 today :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:14:47
Thanks for the great explanation
1 is not my case as I have been holding just for 3 weeks, I am a newbie which did his panic sell ��
2 I didn't think about it, you are definitely right. That is insane
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:44:07
thanks for the great explanation. I will considering buying one once I have more $$$$ in CoinBase
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:51:21
that's why all the others are gaining LOL
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:49:33


is an hardware wallet really needed if using only CoinBase? I read that they have all kind of insurances, it could be more risky a failure on the hardware or if they it is stolen
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:36:52
It was 2 days ago lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:02:54
Yes but let's say this is the scenario and that I need to pay 30% of taxes
A) I have 1 BTC which I paid 10k. I sell it at 15k, so I have to pay 1.5k of taxes. Then I buy it again at 15k and I sell at 20k, so I have to pay another 1.5k of taxes. Total taxes: 3k
B) I hold 1 BTC from 10k and I sell at 20k. I still need to pay 3k of taxes, just like A)
Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:27:35
Did the same earlier this morning
I will go back to it if it falls under 8k
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:53:38


can you extend this? thanks
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:44:36


It is wrong what you are saying. Just 12 months ago BTC was 790$ the 20th December and rallied up to 1,200$ on the 6th of January
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:46:32
Not but soon. For now just Burger King and Taco's Bell
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:55:24
Better luck if you play in Vegas
@_date: 2018-08-13 11:43:37
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:05:20
Will go to 100%, then people will move BTC back to fiat. Imho
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:19:56
next time you may average at 4k$
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:03:59
9100 is not the dip but almost the top of the last few months
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:00:40
easily 14k within the weekend
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:24:37
in the bull market NEVER NEVER sell
if you try to daily trade you are going to be destroyed. Just hold for one year and you will see great things :)
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:37:22
I am also looking at it. Unfortunately I is totally unpredictable, it coul be at 2k or at 8k in a month
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:24:16
I'd suggest every $1000
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:24:15
:) :) :)
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:08:08
I am glad I sold in January, without loss. It was one of the wisest things I did in life. I don't lose time and am much less stressed. Sometime I come back here to read, and wonder how could I spend a few months in that condition. Honor to the few holders who really believe in the coin, but I believe this is like horses betting for the most of you.
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:13:12


no one knows. keep in mind that buying crypto at this time, including BTC, is nothing different from horses races playing
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:56:10
And which time zone
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:24:55
good for you that is funny to lose 5k :(
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:00:10
At 1.95k
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:47:47
looks a poorly made fake to me
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:10:58


yes sell it, I would say
worst case you gained a lot of money
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:52:10
Do you think it is safe to keep $$$ in CoinBase or should I withdraw it at this point?
Not sure I still want to invest
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:40:12
In the 5ish in a few minutes
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:13:16
crypto will be very useful in the future, but they aren't worth that much
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:19:39
In 20 minutes I'd say
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:27:33
In your shoes I wouldn't risk other money and rather buy more maseratis
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:19:53
Unfortunately with current trend that could happen in few days
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:35:38
Few days is not one day
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:47:19
I bet not under 5.5k
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:15:45
You look to have a great plan! Though, I would suggest you to sell now and re-buy when in 2 weeks it will be 3k so that your holding will be more fruitful and your loss minimal
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:46:00
but there will be a better dip after this one as well. So sell your coins and rebuy them later :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:53:41
so, if it goes back to 6k, not impossible, how much are you losing?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:51:36
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:12:54
I will buy at 3k
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:07:28
You could say the same when it was 700
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:40:27
the point is: you have a lot of money. Enjoy your 200k and don't risk to lose them ;)
Why do you need more money?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:38:24
Bad move. This could go to 2/3k in few days
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:09:32
I don't know but it will happen once
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:41:38
can you explain how this can be calculated?
@_date: 2018-07-23 01:15:33
You can gain maybe 1$ per year with such a thing
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:52:41
you will solidly avoid other losts selling now your assets now imho
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:23:53


wait, you sold because BTC went from 8,1k to 7,9k?
I'd suggest you not to re-enter the market then, this stuff is not for you LOL
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:06:06
I am waiting to buy my first BTC when it will be 1k
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:16:24
On his dreams. There are the same chances that it could be at 3k
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:30:48
drop? which drop? LOL
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:38:01
It is much more likely that it will go to 1k than to 5k imho
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:50:59
ahahah I am thinking the same lol
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:07:35
would mean that BTC is finally stable, so maybe in some years
