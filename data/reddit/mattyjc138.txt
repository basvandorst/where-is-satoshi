I (stupidly) downloaded the Freewallet Tether Wallet from the Google play store. I have used other wallets of theirs in the past.
A few days ago I loaded over $6000 USD on to the wallet. When I tried to transfer funds the transaction was held in processing for over 48 hours. 
The only response from their support was an automated email. 
After much cajoling from me on Twitter and the Google play store review section they restored my balance but I still can not move any of my funds.
They are blaming the Tether network but I have sent USDT from an exchange wallet to another exchange wallet without any problems. 
I have tried to take the problem to the Google play store help section but I was met with rudeness and indifference. I was cut off whilst filling a survey they told me to complete.
A "refunded" or "restored balance" is just a number on a screen if you don't have access to and/or are unable to transfer your own funds. 
Avoid Avoid Avoid this wallet. Absolute scam
