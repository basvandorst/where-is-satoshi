I’m probably around $7000, but I’m not adding it up because I have no intention of selling in the near future, I’m still accumulating. With that said, It’s easy to DCA into a bear and can be quite profitable when the market reverses. But how many of you are prepared to Ride the Bull?, it’s tougher!! So don’t add up your curn, just squirrel it away and live your life. Hopefully in 5 years it will be worth exponentially more.

Check out bitpiggys.com, it walks them through a simple process of verification and security. Great way to introduce nocoiner parents

It was 3, I switched to a smaller label 1-1/4” diameter, so I give (5) labels. If you run out, you can do it yourself with Avery labels, but the reality is, you will have the address on your phone after your 1st deposit.
Let me know if you have any questions.

I print the QR code on a 1-1/4 diameter round label. I include about 5 of them with the pig. The intent is to stick one on the side of the pig. Give one to grandma and grandpa, etc. instead of giving a savings bond them can give BTC. Trying to encourage long term savings.

Sorry, I did my best and I’m still working out all the issues. Mike in Space wrote this, he does a good job of explaining. Thanks for feedback, I’ll try and clean it up.

It’s 4:30 in the morning, just patrolled the house. Kids leave them plugged in all the time. Thanks again

Thanks, I’m recommending parents download a watch only wallet associated with the pub key. Again, this is really intended as an introduction, a nice gift to give someone who just had a baby.
@_date: 2019-03-25 06:48:50
It’s intended to be an introduction to BTC, an easy gift. Not for everyone, teach kids long term savings, and responsibility.

Good answer thanks

If you have files you don't want seized, Sia network may be the answer.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:20:17
It seems to cycle, it goes up , retraces, goes up, retraces, making higher highs , it really has very little bit of the market cap of all assets. This could go on for a while and if it is adapted, it could level out at a much higher price. 
At a market cap of 150 billion it could
Double in a month.
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:02:27
I agree with you 1000% and I appreciate your reply.

Yes but it’s deflationary because people are competing for a fixed quantity making the value go up. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:49:56
If I know my money will buy me more today than tomorrow, I am more likely to spend. (This is inflationary) if I think my money will get me more value in the future, I am more likely to save(this is deflation),
I’m thinking in the future BTC will have a huge market cap, not be as volitile, and be used primarily for savings. We will need another currency for our spending that needs to be inflationary. Because we need velocity for the economy to function for all.
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:57:00
Wish I knew how
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:12:31
I watch total volume traded and it’s been between 6-8 billion a day.
I think the 200 day average is a good indicator of its adaptation and rising price.

@_date: 2018-03-01 14:01:14
Thank you. 
Do you think it will eventually be used as a store of value and we will convert to something inflationary issues by our governments? And thrive to earn to save BTC?
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:43:21
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:09:14
If we all hoard it, it will limit the supply, if it’s used for commerce there will be a demand which will drive up the price making it worth more in the future
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:42:10
Will do thanks
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:33:36
If you think the 200 day MA is support or a benchmark in value on when to buy. Keep in mind it will go up because of the August and September days it loses. It’s like my golf Handicap. I could be shooting like shit but if they are canceling out a high score on the backend, my HC won’t move.

The divisibility arguement doesn’t hold water, more money that goes into x, makes x as a whole worth more
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:08:10
Excellent response, i think you make great points I will read this several times.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:04:31
Sorry if you think I was being anything but inquisitive.
I will take your advice and watch Anop in youbtube some more.
What is OP?
I am a holder/investor in BTC, I just feel like a tool because so many people say HODL, and I wouldn’t be myself if i did
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:41:30
Very well said
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:43:55
Agree, the divisibility by decimal argument doesn’t hold water because the more money that goes into x , x as whole will be worth more.
In my mind the only way I see this panning out positive for bitcoin is if it becomes the world’s reserve value. Where transactions are only initiated to save or convert to another crypto cash type currency for your spending needs. I believe that the cash type crypto may be a digital fiat issued by our government 
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:55:46
But why would a business man take a risk and start a business? If his capital was deflationary? We need risk takers and entrepreneurs

When you say shill, are you being sarcastic? or do you think he is a true believer in Gold and Bitcoin? or do you think he is just promoting for his own benefit or a little of both?
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:51:53
Economy needs velocity, I’m a business owner and if people stop spending I’m in trouble and I think that probably holds true for your situation also
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:41:47
What if it started with 100 stake holders? And allowed other stake holders via an investment into the mining hardware.

@_date: 2018-02-25 14:31:29
It’s a good idea, I’m sure someone will try it
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:00:44
Yes I am worried about hyper inflation, our governors have promised what we don’t have and have realized the only way to lighten our debts in today’s dollars is to make today’s dollars worth pennies.
In Trace Mayer’s words, “Run to gold” and Silver and Bitcoin.
Forget about dollars and value all your assets in gold. I bought my $600,000 house in 1999, it’s now worth $1,000,000, sounds great right? Well $600,000 was over 2200 oz of gold in 1999, $1,000,000 is around 700 oz of gold today.
I believe we are beyond the tipping point and u need to prepare yourself

If BTC flat lines, the 200 Day Moving average will gain about 35 points a day for the next 60 days based on the back end loss.
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:59:30
I read about sweatcoin, it tracks your location and movement and is not accurate. 
I like your idea, if a major insurance company and someone like Nike sponsored it, it could be huge.
They already have the customer base.
Imagine after your health insurance physical the salesman gives you two rates, 1) if you continue with your lifestyle and 2) if you exercise an hour a day.
Same thing with health insurance, the company could audit your activity and base your next year’s premium on it.
Imagine you go down to the unemployment office, ready, willing and able to work and they tell you, you need to shape up at the Unemployment office and use the machine an hour a day until you find a job to get your check? The applicant would eventually find a job or would be in great shape
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:24:34
I understand but if BTC is adopted by the masses, they will do the same if the long term trend is up, which would bring our economy to a stand still(everyone saves) We need people to spend and take risks.

I don’t understand? Yes the manufacturer of the initial miner would have a monopoly but we could eventually allow other manufacturers to make them. But the block chain would be decentralized amongst the early adapters and everyone who joined in. Everyone would have their own private keys.

we need a 2nd layer solution to avoid the taxes of an on chain transaction. I was thinking LN could give you the option to settle your channel with newly bought BTC and then return your original BTC escrow.
