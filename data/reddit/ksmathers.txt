Coinbase has the narrowest margins of any bitcoin seller in the US, at the cost of somewhat paranoid fraud detection that seems to frustrate a number of people.   
Other options include Localbitcoins (pricing is at a premium, but if you choose someone with a high trust rating then the purchase should go through reliably).   But if you really want to trade bitcoin then I would recommend opening a trade account with one of the major exchanges.  Bitstamp and Bitfinex seem to have the bulk of the traffic.  The only exchange platfom in the US, to the best of my knowledge, is CampBX and the only complaints that I've seen are that it can be difficult to deposit money, but you will have to complete the KYC questionnaires everywhere these days.

As an essentially unregulated market bitcoin trading is probably manipulated at all of the exchanges to the extent that it is possible to do so without losing a lot of money or violating the rules of the exchange in an obvious way.
In the community this has produced a certain level of indifference to news articles, and other forms of wide broadcast warnings.   We let the whales try to best one another in the market and dart in to snap up a deal when it looks good to us, and avoid overreaching so that we can't be squeezed out when the market takes an unexpected jog.
Holding for a longer term than interests the larger traders causes everything to eventually level out modulo the major runups that happen occasionally.

GHash.IO is a mining pool, and as a centralized mining pool they have pretty much direct control over the contents of the blocks that their member miners attempt to mine.   That means that for all practical purposes GHash.IO is now capable of performing trust attacks on the bitcoin blockchain.
The trust in question is that the blockchain represents a consensus view of which transactions are valid.   GHash can prevent any transaction they don't happen to like from entering the blockchain, and they can, if they wish to, prevent any other mining coalition from ever adding any blocks to the block chain by simply ignoring them and continuing to solve blocks faster than the other miners can do so all combined.
It is a little bit like suddenly having a central bank.   Not knowing GHash.IO's motives in gathering that much mining power into one pool, it is hard to guess what they will do with it.   For now, probably nothing at all, but maybe once we are all indifferent to centralized control over the blockchain (for example people might think that nothing bad has happened so far, so why is throwing such a fuss) they will decide to experiment with taking all of the blocks for themselves, or with reversing one or two block old transactions, etc.

Exchanges are involved in almost all Bitcoin to Product transactions.  Buyers need to get Bitcoin in order to buy.  Sellers need to convert Bitcoin back to fiat to pay their suppliers.
I am holding on to Bitcoin as an investment.  I am also buying Bitcoin to spend on goods.  I am also mining trivial amounts of Bitcoin that I either throw into my spending wallet or my savings wallet, depending on how I feel that day.  I also send bitcoin to my favorite podcasters to support their work.  So which category does that put me into in your mind?
And why is it that you think that someone who is saving Bitcoin isn't contributing to the community anyway?   Anyone who has money locked up in the Bitcoin marketplace is imbuing a level of trust in Bitcoin that is valuable in itself regardless of any other behavior they may or may not be engaged in.    That trust reduces Bitcoin volatility and raises the trade value.   It also provides a fiat base against which anyone who needs fiat can exchange their Bitcoins in order to cover expenses.

Without a change to the proof of work algorithm it isn't possible to take a valid solution to a block and deposit it somewhere other than into the account that it was constructed for.   There have been proposals for a new algorithm that would allow miners to steal block solutions from the pools that they mine for which would create a disincentive for pools to operate, but that isn't possible without making an incompatible software change.

I think the Danish central bank was trying to imply that like glass beads, any sense of the rarity of bitcoin is artificially imposed.  
Granted that alt-coins can create any number of alternate unpegged units of cryptocurrency, and that the difference between bitcoin and any other altcoin is technically slight, the
main difference in my mind (between beads and bitcoin, and in this context) is that even if the bitcoin community wanted to cash in on the rising popularity of bitcoin per se, there isn't any mechanism in the protocol for relieving the limited supply of bitcoin.   
In the specialty bead market you essentially have to trust the name-brand manufacturer of beads not to make more beads than the market values.  In the bitcoin market the rate of bitcoin creation is fully disclosed and unchangeable for all practical purposes.
However, since beads aren't actually used as currency, the lack of fungibility, transportability, and other issues aren't really comparable.

Bitcoin is too volatile to act as a basis price for sales.  If your suppliers charge you dollars for your inventory then it makes sense to price your products in dollars and convert to bitcoin on the fly.  Moreover, if you end up wanting to keep bitcoins, even if you think the price per bitcoin should be $10k, it still doesn't make sense to sell your products for less bitcoin than you would have been able to buy with equivalent dollars.
Merchants in other countries price their products in other local currencies I imagine.

You say you created the passphrase for your wallet by hand.  If you are using a brain wallet, that is a wallet in which the payment address is generated from a passphrase that you entered, then that is the most likely source of the problem.
Since you have your wallet.dat, and since you have never had more than 20 bitcoins, it stands to reason that the transaction bce3e00863125b5232dec01a2b8b8c620c40a75695211b0d2b52db1fa490ece3 isn't yours.  You will need to go back to your wallet and find the address that the bitcoins were sent from.  With that you can find the transaction that ensued.
Some thoughts on brain wallets:
In order to be unique a bitcoin address must contain enough entropy to reduce the likelihood of a conflict below about 2^64.   Bitcoin addresses themselves use a 160-bit hash function for address discrimination, so the chance of a collision is about 1 in 2^80 nominally.   That chance is so small that we can ignore it as a practical impossibility.
But there are ways to increase the risk of collision to the point where they will actually occur.  For example taking a random 1 kilo byte string on any hard drive anywhere in the world would have a total entropy limit of only around 2^62 (600 Exabytes) even if every byte of that data was randomly generated.  The chance of collision by having two people happen to pick the same string somewhere on every hard drive in the world would at most be about 1 in 2^31.
A passphrase is probably the weakest way to generate a wallet address and has been responsible for a large number of lost bitcoins over the years.  If you want to use a passphrase to generate a wallet then there is only one method that I know of that can be used to create a passphrase with enough entropy to be worthwhile, and that is the Diceware process:
A passphrase consisting of 13 diceware words would have an entropy sufficient to generate a unique bitcoin address that is as strong as bitcoin itself.

I'll second that, with the additional note that sending a payment and doing a withdrawal are the same thing.  If you can send bitcoin to an address then whatever that address references is what will be given the bitcoin sent.  If the address is a desposit address generated for you on Coinbase then it will be added to your Coinbase account.

First of all there is a lot more cryptography crap in Bitcoin than just in the blockchain.  The blockchain Merkle tree uses simplest algorithms in the code base.
Second, without the blockchain you wouldn't be able to verify that a payment transaction is referencing unspent transaction outputs since what it means to be unspent is that they are not superceded by another transaction on the blockchain.

The difficulty retargeting is defined in the code as 2016 blocks.  If you suddenly had enough hashing power to double the rate of block generation then blocks would get generated every five minutes instead of ten, and the time to 2016 blocks would halve.
Nominally the recalc happens every 14 days or so, but has been closer to 10 days over the last six months or so with the exponential growth in hashing power.   The current estimate is about 10 days to the end of the next difficulty cycle, so a doubling inserted today would cause a recalc in 5 days.

Perhaps has a different notion of what the flaws of Bitcoin are than the community does.  For example, we aren't especially welcoming of anyone who advises us that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme since it generally means that the author is simply repeating something they heard from someone who is grossly misinformed both on the nature of Ponzi schemes, and on the nature of Bitcoin.   
So if that was what he is referencing then I'm sure I have personally downvoted him.
Actual flaws such as the effect that rapidly rising valuation is having on transaction mining fees, limits on number of transactions per day, anticipated effects of mining coops on reliability of the blockchain, the impact of coin marking or invalidation, and many other topics are discussed in some depth, but not entirely with cool heads I think.

The problem of creating a decentralized digital currency is in part dependent on being able to create a shared ledger which records spend events and ensures that the currency can't be spent twice at different locations.   Bitcoin achieves consensus on the state of the ledger by using proof of work to ensure that each transaction registered in the ledger has time to propagate around the world before new transactions will be added on top of it.   The proof of work algorithm attempts to ensure that only one randomly chosen member of the community can add a new block to the blockchain once every ten minutes on average, which provides the time needed to propagate its transactions, and gives a global ordering to the transactions.   Choosing a member of the community at random ensures that the transactions that are omitted from the ledger represent no single member's interests, thus on average reflecting the values of the community as a whole.  
Satoshi's proxy for choosing a random member of the community was through provable hashing power, under the assumption that hashing power would be approximately evenly distributed through the community.  But even if it were not exactly evenly distributed, selecting the community member who will attach the next block to the blockchain through hashing will eventually represent all members of the community as long as no one member can expect to generate a majority of the new blocks.
What I mean by a simplifying assumption, is that there is no mechanism provided in the invention that controls or limits how often any member of the community is randomly chosen.   Satoshi simply claimed that the system would continue to work fairly absent a majority control of the hashing power, and assumed the problem away without any technical means of preventing it from happening.
Do you disagree with that?   It all seems implicit from the white paper to me.   Satoshi didn't see any need to address the problem of a single organization having 51% of the total hashing power because he thought that the problem was unlikely to ever arise, and that hashing power would tend to even out as the network grew.   Those assumptions have proven incorrect in part, in as much as miners will voluntarily collaborate in large pools and possibly in a single large pool all under the control of a single party who can choose which transactions to include and which to ignore.

Psychological resistance to the $800 price per Bitcoin may be a problem, but the position of the decimal point is arbitrary.   You can just as easily buy 1.0BTC, 0.1BTC, or 0.014BTC, and can likewise spend Bitcoin in any fractional amount.
Compared with using a credit card, Bitcoin doesn't charge your service provider 3-4% of the transaction value just for the privilege of being able to collect your money, so your service provider will be more profitable and can use that additional profit to make better products or can possible offer discounts.   Also, Bitcoins don't bill you, you pay them.  As a result you won't see random recurring billing entries on your Bitcoin transaction log that you would have to spend an hour on the phone with someone in order to figure out and cancel.

While there might be enough people exiting the market to drive the price down, the history of fiat currencies shows that it takes an awful lot of corruption to drive out all of the good money.
More likely IMHO, is that some group like GHash would liquidate a bunch of bitcoin, then purposely hit 51%, drive the price down some, then buy back in at the lower price, and lower their completion rate below threshold again until confidence is restored.  Rinse, wash, repeat.
After a few cycles people will become inured to the magical 51% number and GHash will have to find some other way to fiddle with the market, which kind of sucks, but miners are so deep under water right now that I don't think they are really considering their options clearly.

Sorry, I was using a tablet at the time or I would have been a bit more clear in my thoughts.
If you have 51% of the hashing power under your control then you can ignore any blocks generated by other miners and still have the longest/most difficult chain.  As a result you will have mined 100% of the blocks that are part of the accepted blockchain during the period where you followed this policy.
In truth I doubt that any mining group would do so.  There is very little advantage to be gained against the enormous bad will that would be generated.   
Although all of the blocks would be yours you wouldn't have any more blocks in the blockchain than you would if you had built on the blocks that other people were generating, it is just that the average block completion time would nearly double and would continue at that rate for nearly 20 days until the next difficulty recalculation.

MtGox was something like 20% of the market before this latest disaster, and had strong loyalty among a certain class of speculative investor.  We'll have to see how long it takes for those investors to decide to either abandon the marketplace or move their trading to a new exchange.   
If they are opening new accounts at another exchange then I would expect a minimum of 30 days to complete the KYC prerequisites.   But waves from MtGox will undoubtedly continue the volatility for months.
That said, I have been buying as well, just doing so slowly given the market turmoil.   There is a lot of good news in the market that is getting buried in the more obvious chaos and gloom.

As the oldest existing exchange, MtGox has had more time to discover and eliminate both software and process problems that would affect the success of their business.  Their trading platform, verification procedures, custom wallet, and banking relationships have existed for longer than anyone else has.
All else being equal, I would normally place more faith in a system that has survived and been improved for a longer time.  But I think there are serious reasons to doubt that the MtGox platform is actually a viable basis for a company, under any management.
Sometimes the original developers are simply too incompetent to build a platform that is able to become trustworthy within a reasonable period of time.  Sendmail for example was still bug ridden twenty years after it was first released, and this despite making the code available to the entire community to patch and fix. 
If anyone plans to buy out MtGox, I'd hold out for at least some level of a top to bottom security review, and at least some level of accountability - some publicly reviewable record of assets and liabilities.   And if the liabilities are only fractionally backed by comparable assets then some degree of risk/reward, interest, or incentive would have to be offered that is in line with the actual risk.
I can see multiple ways of accomplishing this.  I'm not sure how easy it would be to do on top of the already failed MtGox.

Ok, if that is the case then we should see a shortage of bitcoins as the GoxCoins that are removed from the economy are taken into account and we realize that real bitcoins are more scarce than the bitcoins + goxcoins that we previously thought were available.
Of course the same will hold true if the Goxcoins were stolen over a long period of time, if they were stolen but aren't placed on an exchange, or if they are actually in MtGox's possession but the keys have been lost.

If the future bitcoin blockchain were to be exposed to the rest of the network today then it would replace the current blockchain provided the rules for validating blocks remained the same during that period of time.  
There can be rule changes in the block chain however, and if there is no code to support those rule changes in the current code then those blocks would obviously be considered invalid as would any that built upon them.   Moreover, having now caused a change in history, any payments in the later blockchain that were dependent on keys not yet generated would likely never be generated (modulo your model for fate), so a lot of people's bitcoins would irretrievably disappear.  
I think we'd probably fork the blockchain (on purpose).
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:20:07
When Coinvalidation releases its first usable system there will likely be a blockchain fork to try to establish rules that confound it, and that blockchain will probably survive regardless of what the original chain does since there are a number of people who simply won't stand for the substitution of pseudo-privacy for pseudo-anonymity.
And of course actually making bitcoin accounts trackable will require a fork of the client implementations if not of the core protocols.
A fork that tries to rid the blockchain of GHash.io is tricky to imagine implementing.  Other miners could try to ignore any transactions that derive from GHash generated coins, but first of all that would be the same thing that Coinvalidation is trying to do, and second, the cure would probably be worse than the disease.   The best way of dealing with GHash is to convince miners to drop out of their pool.
Or else maybe the pool owners will finally grow up.

I don't think their business model works that way.  Probably they should have a closed loop sale feature, but right now I believe they direct most or all of their sales through one of the public exchanges.   Running out of bitcoins is actually running out of fiat with which to buy bitcoins at an exchange, which happens due to the time required to complete an ACH transfer, and sending cash to merchants won't help that.
I'd be happy to hear otherwise if I am mistaken in some regard.

Consider the motivations of the people you are writing about.  Anyone who is holding bitcoin will want to continue being able to use it and won't settle for a reduced stake in an alt-coin unless there is no alternative.
Given the size of the Bitcoin market, it seems likely to me that in the presence of an actual threat Bitcoin will be adapted to be quantum-computing resistant, and that those changes will be rapidly adopted.
At that point it will still be the new-Bitcoin versus a plethora of alt-coins with varied characteristics, and the size of the market in terms of goods and services that are addressed by the crypto-coin will still decide the winner.
In other words, it might be easier to switch coins, but that doesn't mean it will happen.

Most sites pregenerate five or ten years worth of nonces, then hash them and put a hash of the combined list onto the public block chain, usually in the form of a payment to an address made up of bits that use the hash output value as the recipient or the payment amount.   
After that you can reveal each nonce one at a time and leave it to anyone who is interested to verify that the hashed nonce is listed in your public document and that the public document was linked to the blockchain at some point in the past.

These are valid concerns.  The thing is Bitcoin is already suffering a huge dent to its reputation.   And unless we find a new concensus soon anyone who has the technical background to understand what just happened is going to be reducing their exposure until the rule isn't just 'Don't invest more than you can afford to lose', but 'Don't invest more than you are going to need to use in the next couple of days plus some "what the hell, maybe it will pan out" money.'
I for one do not trust GHash.io as benevolent controller of the blockchain.   Sure thinks that GHash will behave themselves rather than kill their golden goose, but I disagree.   GHash will, IMHO do anything they think they can get away with.   If they can sell high and buy low by periodically twisting the knife just a bit, I have no doubt in my mind that they will do so.

Difficulty recalculation happens at a periodic block interval, not time interval.  If a large proportion of miners were to drop out of mining for the next 2016 blocks then the time required to mine those blocks would go up proportionately (let's say 130 days @ 10% of the hashing power).  Any reduction in mining difficulty would then last for another 2016 blocks, meaning that any miners that dropped out would have given up chances at 2016 blocks in order to get a chance at another 2016 blocks that they could have tried for anyway and that will all get consumed very quickly (about 1.3 days) once the hash rate is restored.
The main impact on the visible hashing rate is that the actual hashing rate is only estimated by the luck of the network.  As block completion time slows (as miners are unlucky) the apparent hashing rate drops.  A 30% swing is well within the standard deviation for the network as a whole.

It isn't a good sign, but I don't agree that the conclusion necessarily follows that they would be arbitrating that difference away if they could.   
If MtGox needed to sell bitcoin in order to survive as a business, they wouldn't actually have to buy the bitcoin from the exchange in order to do so.  Whatever bitcoin they have is actually managed by the exchange, so they can take it and repurpose it without having to put any money into the exchange to do so.   
The same thing goes for cash.  The only act that adds cash into MtGox' purse is when someone deposits new cash at the exchange.   Any trades that are done visibly on the exchange are just for show, they don't add or remove any money from MtGox.  At best they can reduce MtGox's liabilities with respect to their users, but dropping the price of bitcoin does the same thing in that regard.

This transaction:
doesn't involve a 12.7 BTC exchange.   There are a couple of possibilities, but the most likely one is that you just made an entry error when sending the original transaction.  Alternatively the transaction that you remember entering may have been in conflict with another transaction (a double spend) in which case only one of the two transactions can appear in the blockchain.  Or else there could be a bug in the wallet you are using that resulted in an erroneous transaction being sent although this is unlikely.
Your two mystery transactions are from 13 months ago.   See the following blockchain page, where your mystery transactions are the last two (oldest) entries:
The oldest is a deposit of about 55 BTC (Sept. 2012), which was then paid out to two addresses (Dec. 2012) with 22 BTC going to one address and about 33 BTC going to another.  One of those two addresses should be a change address.  If you are seeing an unexpected balance of either 22 BTC or 33 BTC (plus your 6.7BTC) then the most likely explanation is that you have used this blockchain wallet before and have simply forgotten about it.  
If you don't see either value in your balance then your wallet has an address that is also listed in someone else's wallet.  The most likely explanation for this would be that you at some point in time added an address to your blockchain wallet that was generated from a brain wallet passphrase.  If that is the case then someone else happens to have chosen the same passphrase.

You wouldn't have to get the mining community to accept it; if you could get adoption by the major exchanges that would probably suffice.   Miners don't contribute to the fiat liquidity, they make use of it.  Take away that liquidity and the miners will come along whether they like it or not.

Sure is.  When the price goes down you have the opportunity to lower your basis price, provided you haven't already put in as much as you are willing to lose.  
That is why I say I am buying cautiously.   I haven't yet seen a turn around that feels like a change in the market, but I do want to get as much advantage of the current low prices as possible without overcommitting myself yet.   If the market gets down to $330 or so I will be all in and waiting to see how things work out over the next year.  At that point if price keeps dropping I might start chewing on fingernails a bit, but not as much as if I were overinvested.
For me, bitcoin is a highly speculative, but very exciting new technology that I'm willing to lose money in if need be.  Because I don't know what the market is going to do, I'm not willing to put in more cash than I am willing to lose, but up to that limit I am more curious than I am worried.

Cutting short the trade loop should be well worth the development time assuming that Coinbase can do so without holding Bitcoin longer than is supported by their business model.  
For example if a large sale involves some 100 bitcoin or so, the client will have of necessity had to buy the bitcoin before offering them to the merchant.  The merchant will then sell 100 bitcoin for which there may not be any buyers remaining that are asking for those bitcoin until the next morning.  
Coinbase can't tolerate the risk of holding bitcoin over a long enough period of time to ensure that any sale will be covered by buys nor vice versa.  Since they offer prices within 1% of the current market price, and daily fluctuation in bitcoin often exceeds 1%, it stands to reason that Coinbase must sell and buy on the market as expediently as possible.
On the other hand, if buy and sell orders can be matched against one another, they obviously save themselves both the spread and the trade overhead of the markets.

Coinbase doesn't allow you to maintain a balance at the exchange.   Each new trade you make will result in more cash being taken from your checking account before the previous trade is deposited.
The Coinbase instant buy option is essentially a short term loan which you have to pay back from cash already in your checking account.  If you sell and immediately buy again the cash you gained from the sale wouldn't count toward the cash needed to complete your purchase.

A paper wallet is proof against loss until the first spend is made from the wallet provided that you protect the paper itself from loss or theft.
After the first spend is made you should use a new paper wallet.  Or more to the point, you should probably include all unspent transaction outputs in the first spend you transmit against the paper wallet, with change directed to a new paper wallet if you want the same level of protection for those bitcoins.
After the first spend a paper wallet is only as safe as a hot wallet.

I suspect that the difficulty of that divorce is in large part responsible for many of the features in Bitcoin.    Applying innovation to money was like tilting at windmills five years ago.  We were dreaming of experimenting with micropayments but without control over the payment networks any attempt to experiment with them resulted in more of the same old thing.
Take Paypal as an example.  Paypal did not set out to become yet another credit card processing company.  But chargebacks have given their business model the same fraud avoidance overhead of every other payment system in current use.
By making a decentralized electronic currency bitcoin attempts to escape that trap.  Politics may influence bitcoin holders, and constrain the services built on top of the currency, but trying to constrain it too strongly will just give incentive to move to an alt-coin chain.

...my point wasn't that we are in the middle of a 51% attack, but that absence of evidence isn't the same thing as evidence of absence.   We really badly need some method of showing on an ongoing basis that there is no attack instead of waiting for evidence that an attack is in progress before we panic.




A single entity having 51% control of the hashing power on the network can be very easily hidden by through the use of multiple reward addresses, and by avoiding the types of misbehavior that would be rapidly noticed.   Have you checked to see if the abandoned block rate has gone up by 1% in the last few months?   Have any of those abandoned blocks included double spends?    If either of those happen to be true can you positively associate them with 51% control of the network?   They are both possible evidence, but as long as the controlling organization avoids being obvious that evidence is likely to be ignored as refutable.
The altcoin 51% attacks that have been successful have been very obvious, and were probably conducted in an effort to discredit those coins, not for profit.   I wouldn't presume that the same would hold true for Bitcoin, presupposing that anyone actually has had that control.
Before you assume that other people don't understand the core concepts of bitcoin, you might want to check that your own house is in order.

There are several possible approaches, and which you use depends on what you are trying to accomplish.
To make it easier and cheaper for users to spend small amounts of bitcoin, off block chain transactions means using the blockchain as a settlement protocol used to exchange balances between markets.  
Trade within a market becomes just a database transaction with no blockchain presence at all.  
Trade between markets (such as when buying something inexpensive in a market hosted in Germany while using funds hosted in a US market) involves a protocol for agreeing to exchange debts for value and then settling those debts.
Another alternative is to use the scriptability of blockchain to put a certain amount of bitcoin effectively on escrow until a series of micro transactions have been completed.  The micro transactions can be completed off blockchain with just the final state recorded in the blockchain.
A related approach is to make each microtransaction be a valid transaction in itself but not transmit the transaction to the network.  To complete the transaction either party can transmit the last received transaction together with their own signature to finalize it in the block chain.   The Mastercoin work has proposed additional changes that would allow an initial transaction to be recorded which could then be redeemed by the longest transaction chain received within a given window once at least once end transaction is received by the network.

Bots trading as if they were humans means that you can't rely on market volume as a metric to determine the size of the market.  Since the exchanges generally charge a percentage on trades, there would have to be some reason that someone wanted to bump up the volume, but I will grant that those reasons might be sufficient to impact the overall trade volumes.   
But what you can reasonably rely on  IMO is the market depth at each of the exchanges.   If the depth is $20M then you know that there is at least that much cash invested in the market right now.   Any real person who buys bitcoin is throwing a little bit of money into that pool, and anyone who cashes out bitcoin (which is the accepted practice for most businesses that accept bitcoin, but of course anyone with bitcoin can do so) is withdrawing a little money from the pool.

The range check you link to restricts known weak ECDSA keys from the generation range, which was the first part of my statement.  The second part, that some keys are interrelated so that knowing the relationship between one and its public key provides enough insight to find the private keys for the others isn't something that needs to be filtered at generation time.
Although these keys will be effectively hidden from one another by the RIPEMD-160 hashing, the first spend event will reveal them.  Lucky then that they still only amount to a 1 in 2**120 event.

Looking at the trade volume on Bitfinex, my guess is that some whale decided to squeeze out the margin traders.   The price has been in a generally upward trend for the last couple of weeks which encourages traders to take on more leverage in order to multiply the benefit they get from a later sale.  But by successfully pushing the price down a large trader can force the sale of any margin traded bitcoins as the price drops to the point where a trader has to either put up the rest of the buying price, or else sell off bitcoins to raise enough cash to cover his exposure.

BIP 0070 relies on X.509 PKI for establishing authenticity.  The advantage of this approach is that you can match the certificate of the website you visited to the one that requests payment.  The disadvantage is that you are subject to the whimsy of the certification authority and their possibly limited ability to keep names consistent with the entities they are meant to represent.

dskloet was probably asking for examples because there isn't a single reason to answer you with.  Some people are always pissy, so maybe that is what happened to you.  Other times people ask questions that have been covered hundreds of times, are listed in the FAQ, and haven't done the minimal research needed to be considered worth spending time answering.
Downvotes come in waves and everyone gets them.  There are people on this list who believe that Bitcoin is evil or at least extremely misguided and who will stop at nothing to let everyone know how wrong we all are.
There are also people on here who are just here to either prop up the current buy in, or push down the current sell off, and they will downvote anything that doesn't help them in their goal to either sell high or buy low as the case may be.
In between the idiocy though I think you will find that there are some useful discussions.
IMHO it helps if you take part by upvoting anything that isn't being intentionally derogatory, or is adding to the discussion, whether you agree with it or not.  That is what I do.

Commerce site?   Could someone have hacked the site and stumbled across the bitcoin by chance?
If the server is only for your own use then the likely avenues of attack are much smaller.   The locked IP address probably rules out cache poisoning, and most forms of external threat other than hacking.   Some app developers have complained in the past that operators at their hosting service providers may have had direct access to servers and have stolen bitcoin from those servers.  
A partner or employee could be a vector of attack.  To eliminate this as a possibility ask among any employees with access to the server whether there have been any calls from your hosting company with requests to maintain or lock down the system.   Anything that could have been a social engineering attack.   Actual embezzlement is harder to identify in the short term, but if you have any ex-employees with possible access to the server I'd recommend rebuilding the server from installation to deployment.
Last are external attacks.  It might be worth hardening the server (Bastille is a good tool for Linux), redirecting logging to an external host, and adding a firewall between the server and the Internet if you don't have one already.   Other than that you probably need a security review of your code.

There are a number of well known attacks in distributed systems research, and the one you describe is one of them.  Reaching consensus when an adversary can see or hear communications is the Man In the Middle (MITM) attack, but it is only loosely related to the Byzantine Generals Problem.   It can be adequately handled by key exchange protocols such as Diffie-Hellman.
In the Byzantine Generals Problem, the attacker is one of your peers, with as much trust as you have, not a third party.  The question then is not how to reach consensus between two participants, but within a group that consists of a unknown number of traitors.

Almost all ASIC hardware is sold prior to manufacture with the development costs paid out of the income from presales of the miner.
Thus manufacturers primarily sell mining equipment because it pays for the hardware development.  
That said, it is also far more profitable to develop mining hardware than it is to mine with it.  Most mining hardware will not break even in terms of its ability to mine enough bitcoin to cover the cost of purchase.   
If the value of bitcoin drops then the problem is exacerbated; you can't mine enough bitcoin and the bitcoin you do mine isn't worth as much.   
If the value of bitcoin goes up you might turn a profit in fiat, but still lose out compared to an equivalent investment in bitcoin, with a better ability to divest or change investments if you hold the coin instead of the hardware.
The one really practical thing that mining does is to give you really untraceable bitcoin.   If you mine solo.   If your mining rig is only connected to the bitcoin network through TOR.  
However.  The first deliveries of new miners that can hit a new price per gigahash point do have the capacity to turn quite profitable if you can get them online before any of your competitors.  This is a widely promulgated complaint against mining equipment manufacturers, although I think it happens less than most people imagine.  You can see the changes in hashing power on the network graphs, and I just don't see strong evidence to support the claim that most mining manufacturers predeliver equipment to themselves at the expense of their customers with a few exceptions.

You haven't put yourself in the right frame of mind for accepting Paypal payments in exchange for bitcoin.  I suggest you consider it from the perspective of a thief who has just paid $20 in exchange for a stolen credit card number with personal identification on a carding forum.
Your thoughts as a thief are: how do I make my $20 investment pay off without leading the cops to my door.  
Try to wrap your head around how you would accomplish that feat, and lets see if you can come up with a better approach than sending a Paypal payment to someone on LocalBitcoin in exchange for a Bitcoin payment.  
Until the original owner of the card happens to notice the spurious charge or the fraud reduction bureau gets in touch with him to verify the transaction, Paypal will assume that the transaction is valid and show it to you as complete.   Then when the payment is challenged you'll lose out, but the thief will have made off with your Bitcoin with no recourse and little chance of tracing it in the future.

@_date: 2014-02-08 02:12:43
Yours is a common misconception, but there is quite a lot you can tell about a transaction at zero confirmations.  
For example you can tell that the transaction references unspent transaction outputs.  You can verify that the signature is correct.  And thus will be eligible for inclusion in the next block.  If you continue listening for more transactions to be broadcast you can even tell if someone is attempting to send a conflicting transaction into the network, possibly in time to intercept your customer before they leave the shop.
Even if the blockchain happens to split during the next block, the most likely outcome is that your transaction will be appear the same in both blocks.  Either way it remains eligible for inclusion until a conflicting transaction is included in the blockchain so you can resubmit the transaction yourself once you hear it, even if the rest of the network inexplicably forgets to include it.
The blockchain has only one purpose in the bitcoin network, and that is to serialize transactions.  If you generally trust your customers not to mess with you, which seems like a reasonable assumption if you are selling coffee, then you can accept zero confirmation transactions without the least bit of idiocy being involved.

MtGox is a serious problem but also temporary, and it doesn't IMO reflect on the long term prospects of Bitcoin.
Thus what I see when I look at the MtGox implosion is a discount on the purchase of more Bitcoin, and I suspect many other people react the same way.
The limit to that resilience, at least from a US perspective, is that Coinbase has cash flow limits set by their own cash reserves and the time required to complete bank transactions.   Regardless of the pricing it isn't really possible to inject cash into the market via Coinbase at a rate that exceeds that.
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:45:53
Mining ensures that transactions are serialized on the blockchain.  It solves a distributed trust problem by requiring a large amount of work to be done before a transaction can be considered valid.  Given that large amount of work, it is very difficult for anyone to create two chains which have conflicting versions of that transaction.

The part of the internet that is still up will continue processing transactions as usual.  For the people who are disconnected their best bet will be to print paper wallets in small denominations and trade them for goods.   Anyone who accepts them would have to trust the wallets not to be duplicates, or else have a way to transfer the data to a clearing agent outside the affected zone.
The work on side chains might make it possible to run a mostly disconnected regional network without having to refer constantly to the common blockchain, but would require at least a couple of days advance warning to be effectively up to the task of trading Bitcoin per se.
Sneakernet dumps of bulk transaction requests could also be used to move transactions from an affected region to one not affected to get eventual recording on the blockchain.

A fee of 1 Satoshi isn't enough to be considered a transaction with a fee by any mining pool, so what you are waiting for is confirmation as a free transaction, which is what your below threshold transactions will be treated as.

The basis for my bet would be that the Bitcoin community as a whole could find a technical solution to avoiding an indefinite extension of these attacks.  If no such solution could be found then my bet obviously wouldn't pay off, but I expect that any such attack would be sufficiently identifiable to be filtered at the protocol level.
One such proposed filter is to ignore or disallow blocks that do not carry high priority (old/large/fee paying) transactions when there are high priority transactions awaiting confirmation.

When you write that only your IP address can use the API key, do you mean that you have an assigned static IP address?   How is the IP traffic routed to the machine that performs the API calls?

I presume then that your confidence is already utterly shattered.   The hash rate reportedly owned by GHash.IO has no technical reason for representing their entire hashing power.   GHash.IO could be hiding any amount of hashing power they want to under other private keys.   The only link between the key that collects GHash.IO's main hashing pool mining profits and the organization itself is the inference that payments arriving from the pool have their key as a prior owner.   If GHash has other keys that they don't need to use to pay mining profits there would be no evidence to that effect in the blockchain, there would just be additional unknown miners who happen to be GHash.
The 51% margin for safety in Satoshi's paper is a simplifying assumption, not a guarantee, and not really even testable on the blockchain.

For the purposes of subverting the blockchain, all that miner A and miner B have to do is agree to only work with blocks that were signed by the other person or by themselves.   In doing so, assuming that A and B have 51% of the hashing power, they can control all mining on the blockchain by outcompeting any possible coalition of other miners, subject only to their ability to maintain their cartel.   
In other words, your proposal doesn't prevent a 51% attack, it just makes it harder to tell when a 51% attack is happening.

I don't think it is related to any bad news at all, just an increase in bitcoin supply related to someone who needed to convert a fair amount of bitcoin to cash.
The most likely culprit is the sale of a Villa announced yesterday at 'well in excess of $500k.'    Current demand is driving small enough volumes on the exchanges that such a purchase would stand out, and may have pulled in a stream of speculators hoping for a larger dip.
Watching the price dip can be a bit daunting, but it also presents an opportunity to extend your position and lower your basis provided you still have cash left to invest and wouldn't be overextending yourself.   To me it doesn't look like this one is going to go very deep, but I'm still hoping that there will be one more dip into the $400-500 range before the next cycle of uptake.

You would have to come up with some mechanism to non-linearly improve the efficiency of hashing if you want to make it more efficient to concentrate hashing power.   
If the efficiency gains are merely linear then there is no effective advantage over just assigning a separate token per miner.   
Even then though, the problem of a 51% attack isn't that the mining is done from the same IP address, but that all of the miners are influenced by a single person.   If you have two miners with 30% and 21% of the market each, and they collude together, then they effectively have a 51% attack between them.

Mining, even in a mining pool, is a matter of luck.   Your miners check hashes at a rate dependent on their hardware, but your ability to prove that you've worked on the hashing problem is dependent on your luck in finding a partial hash conflict.   Sometimes you find one right away, other times you are searching for ten minutes for something that should have taken a minute or less.   
Miner payoff is paid by performance, not by hardware.   If you are lucky you get paid more, not lucky paid less.   There is no way to make two miners match exactly, and that is by design.
In addition, as others have written, there will be minor differences between miners in actual hashing capacity.  That is because miners are built to run flat out, gated only by heat generated within the chip.   Differences in the mask quality and how well the actual transistors were formed varies performance within a predictable range.

This isn't just theoretical, it is a number of small attacks, each one with a small enough impact that it can be ignored, but all showing some degree of disruption to the market.   Is it all GHash.io?   That isn't proven, and possibly isn't provable, but GHash is a problem.

Ok.  From the Bitcoin-QT console you can extract any private keys that you need to unlock any specific bitcoin payments you have received, whether or not you are in sync with the blockchain.
If you are worried about your bitcoin balance I would go to blockchain.info, verify that the address has a balance, then verify that I have the keys to the address in question.
Bitcoin-QT hides internal addresses that are generated to hold change (the leftover bitcoin after making a payment), so the specific address holding a bitcoin balance may not be visible.  If you have the transaction though you can verify that you are holding the private keys that match the destination address.  You can also verify that the transaction is part of the blockchain (which is what it means for a transaction to be verified.)

I wouldn't characterize the Austrian versus Keynesian arguments as interesting arguments to the bitcoin community.   Which ever model of economics is ultimately correct, bitcoin has certain characteristics which will either prove themselves in the market or be disproven by the market as the case may be.   Arguing with scholars over which model will ultimately promote more bloodshed, or wealth, suffering, or happiness are little more than Platonic musings.   As distracting as arguing over schools of thought can be, putting an idea into effect and seeing the result is much more informative.
The bitcoin technology is open for experimentation.   Bitcoin itself takes an Austrian approach to managing the wealth of the system, but you are free to take that same code and create a new blockchain that implements some other set of rules much better adapted to the "real behavior of economic systems" whatever that may be.

The author is just describing the current pattern, which while it describes human behavior doesn't take into account market forces making it reactive rather than predictive.   Essentially it says that if the pattern remains consistent with recent history, this is what the price will do.   
But if you didn't know that the price was declining over recent history you weren't paying attention.
The real question is whether we have gotten to the bottom of the bad news, and whether the current bad news has been adequately priced in.   There are opinions on both sides of this, but to outline a few of them:
If the MtGox bankruptcy court continues to go down a path of full liquidation then we should expect to see an additional 200k Bitcoins available for sale.  Buyers who were on MtGox might conceivably try to repurchase some of those at the exchanges where they will be liquidated, but there is little reason for them not to wait until the declining trend has reversed more substantially than can be explained by the charts provided here.
The Bitcoin seizures from the Silk Road closure also remain unsold at present, and represent another very large block of available coins.
I would argue that the China news has mostly played itself out, though I could be wrong about that.
Balanced against the bad news yet to be absorbed are a variety of investment funds and startups that are likely to be coming in over the next year.   Whether anticipation of those entries can offset the trend is hard to say.  I'm buying right now, but cautiously.

The bitcoin bytecode is much more restrictive than x86 opcodes, and moreover begins with the input transactions that reference the bitcoins to be spent.  This is not something that will look like text.  Actually it will look more like random data, which unless you are pretty good at distinguishing nearly random data from random data, isn't really the sort of thing you should be signing.

It isn't spaghetti code, so it should be maintainable.   There aren't any obvious SQL insertion attacks in this code, but it also isn't maintaining balances so there isn't much in the way of user specified information in this code anyway.

It would take about 24 hours to penetrate through the most active users, and perhaps a week to make its way through the body of users who pay any attention at all.

Of course it is about the psychology of decimal places.  
The difference is whether you still call the result a 'Bitcoin' if the decimal place moves.   After a stock split (whether by multiplying the underlying tokens or by moving the decimal point) the resulting token would still be called 'Bitcoin', not Millis, nor Bits, nor mBTC, nor Micros, etc.

The potential for success of any alt-coin is going to have to be based on its applicability within some protected niche that Bitcoin itself can't or won't adapt to.   In game currencies or credits for example, or in-store, regional, or community based credit systems are all good places for an alt-coin to find a protected footing.  
Regional protections could range from legal mandates, to tax and reporting issues, to government backing or prohibitions.   Corporate backed credits like Microsoft Points or Nindento game points represent access to a specific library of products and services within a self-contained community and can easily be protected from competition with Bitcoin by the businesses that create those markets.'
I think that Bitcoin can still lend fungibility to these protected markets by making it possible to exchange (for example) WoW gold for Microsoft Points, or Amazon Gift cards.  Whether it lives up to that potential will be interesting to watch.

I don't know.  I'm pretty skeptical of strategies that multiply threat vectors.  Blockchain for example solves the data storage vulnerability by keeping multiple copies of your wallet in different locations.  Of course since the wallet is being duplicated hither and yon it has to be encrypted for security, which means that you have to have a key to unlock it, and that key has to be protected somewhere else.  If you want the storage of that key to be secure and resilient then you are back to paper or some other non-computer storage device except that this time you might be duped into believing that your mind is a good place to store such a key, or that you can make up your own passphrase that has enough entropy to not undercut the security of the bitcoin addresses themselves.
Moreover there are several new layer of security to consider and protect from attack.  Do you trust DNS to point you to blockchain.info?  Do you trust all of your CA's enough to verify that you have actually reached blockchain?  Do you trust the governments where blockchain is situated not to order blockchain to inject an attack into their code?  Do you trust blockchain themselves not to do so?  
These are needless additions to the threat vectors when putting the unencrypted wallet on a piece of paper would be just as effective at protecting your information.   Or if you need multilayer security, then IMHO multi-signature N of M transactions provide a better ability to detect and prevent a partial security breach than any computing technology could do.

Making identity reporting mandatory would first require having an identity, which if we use existing techniques would mean building a centralized system of identity management.

The only block that is affirmatively linked to Satoshi himself is the root block.  Every other block is a matter of either intuition and conjecture or hearsay.

To explain what they mean by this note you would have to understand their basic business model.  In exchange for a 1% margin, Coinbase offers short term loans of USD so that you can buy at the market price today using money that is still in your bank account.   To do that Coinbase has to have money in place at an exchange, or close enough to an exchange that the exchange will let them trade with it.   When bitcoin is more or less flat, there is very little cash movement, instead some buyers put money in, and some sellers take money out.  But during a surge, a lot of money has to move through Coinbase and into an exchange, and the rate at which that can be done is limited by how much cash Coinbase has on hand, how long cash has to sit between transfers, and how long the ACH and international wire transfers take to complete.   Divide cash on hand by the total delay time, and you get an approximation of their expenditure limits per day.

One of the algorithms for removing bias from a fairly good hardware random number generator is to read random bits in pairs, reject any in which both bits have the same value, and then take the first bit of the pair as the output of the filter.  This approach assumes that you are equally likely to find a leading edge or a falling edge when testing adjacent bit pairs, which without making a further assumption about the wave function of the generator is a pretty safe bet provided that the generator doesn't tend to hide one type of edge in favor of another (or more directly, that there is an approximately equal distribution of 1's and 0's in the raw input stream.)
CCD base band noise will have a strong statistical bias that depends both on what you are reading (a JPEG stream will tend to normalize the noise) and on the amplifier circuitry.  Whether these could be adequately filtered out I don't really know.

The best strategy available to MtGox right now, I think, is to let the people who are spooked get out.  That will decrease the fear among those who remain, and give them a reasonable foundation on which to build trust and improve their competence.
They should also consider opening the Kimono (so to speak).  Any assurances that they could give that BTC deposits are in safe storage would tend to improve trust.  Since the banking issues don't seem to be likely to resolve themselves in the near future, anything that could mitigate those problems would also help.

From my perspective the mods have to walk a narrow line between too much and too little moderation.   Every time they delete some scammer's post they risk backlash from the scammer who will often try to drum up sympathy against censorship.   If they delete the censorship discussion as well then they get general community backlash even though the censorship discussion itself is (IMHO) almost entirely off topic and disingenuous.
That is what I mean by thankless.   Very few people can imagine how bad this sub would be absent any moderation, but if you have been around for a while think back to Usenet during its heyday, then throw in a profit motive for anyone to post outright lies.   Signal to noise in the old newsgroups was nearly intolerable even without being able to draw a profit from spamming.
I appreciate the moderators because I can imagine what this sub would look like without their help.  It is tedious and time consuming to check each report, and I doubt that even with the best of intentions that the moderators always get every decision right, but I find this sub worth reading, and that is what ultimately tips the scales for me.

The most likely outcome is that it will create a dark liquidity pool that will reduce upward price pressure at the exchanges, which in turn will cause prices to drop as cash is taken out of the market and not replenished.   How deeply that impacts the market will depend on the buyer and how much bitocoin traffic is directed to the exchanges versus to their own pool of coins.   If they just hold the coins then there will likely be no impact on the market other than the loss of some upward price pressure from that particular buyer.

You might be a completely honest person, but without any history at all it is impossible to tell.  It takes about five minutes to create a reddit account and start making wild accusations against anyone you choose.  And Coinbase in particular is accused of malfeasance every day, and about 90% of it is poorly informed B.S.
If you are really having a problem, then talking to your bank and their support group is exactly the right way to solve it.  Coinbase support is slow, so that is a known problem for which there is unfortunately no better alternative available that is convenient within the US, with the possible exception of LocalBitcoins.
Any other problems you are experiencing may be due to the somewhat unique denial of service attack that happened last week, and which almost all of the exchanges have needed some work to resolve.   But to find out for sure you'll either have to wait for Coinbase's admittedly sub-par support to get back to you, or if you don't have time for that then go through your bank.

In the existing banking system there isn't nearly as much real money as you might expect.   What money there is, is dwarfed by debt, and debt on debt.
It seems to me that the author is trying to evoke a similar response for Doge.   Rather than saving your Doge, just spend your Doge.  If you need some Doge someone will sell you some Doge for whatever they are worth and you can spend those.  If buyers and sellers agree on what Doge are worth then the money will have a fairly stable value and instead of competing to own the most Doge, market makers will compete to create the marketplace that makes Doge accessible at the most convenience.   No one will consider selling Doge for too much because there are billions of Doge out there, all equivalent to one another.  No one will consider letting Doge go too cheaply because, darn it, Doge are worth what they are worth.
It is an interesting point of view, and might work given either a central banking structure, or else a sufficient level of regulation that banks are forced to cooperate in the valuation of Doge, but I can't see it working as a standalone system.

There are also numerous startups that are committed to Bitcoin, and the Agora community has embraced Bitcoin.

If this purchase of 7.6 BTC was the largest purchase you have ever made, and it was made after you should have been asleep, and your password was recently changed, etc. then you will probably have your purchase rejected even if it is completely legitimate.   Since we are coming out of a general downturn in the market, you will also likely be going up against general fraud in the community as people demand refunds (my account was broken into, I accidentally typed 1.0 but meant to type 0.1, etc.) in order to avoid losses.
 
As a rule of thumb, if you want to be able to get Bitcoin at a specific rate that you have control over then you should be using an exchange like Bitstamp.  Coinbase really only works well for trading when you are buying semi-regularly, in similar sized amounts, without special regard for the pricing.   Trying to time Coinbase is often frustrating.

Don't use Coinbase for arbitrage.  Problem solved.
Seriously though, you seem to have mistaken Coinbase for an exchange.  Coinbase takes five days to deliver bitcoin because it takes them five days to complete your ACH transfer and get your cash.   A real exchange has you deposit cash or bitcoin in advance of any trading you want to do so that trades can be completed in realtime.  See 'bitcoinwisdom.com' for graphs from the exchanges.

Bitstamp may have had a hiccup in withdrawals after the malleability denial of service attack on the blockchain last week, but if so it was shortlived.  Personally I trust them as much as I trust any exchange, which is to say enough to trade, but not enough to use as a banking service.
MtGox reportedly has a solution in sight for the malleability problem and will reopen bitcoin withdrawals as soon as it is available.   Personally I would be tempted to take the risk for cheap bitcoins if I had an authenticated account on MtGox.

To successfully perform a 51% attack Bob either needs to convince a majority of the existing miners to help him, or else he needs to buy a little more than the total mining equipment that exists in the world today.  
The latter strategy costs a couple of billion dollars.   The former strategy is harder to accomplish without giving everyone a lot of advance warning that it is coming.
Recovering from such an attack would probably involve donations in order to make some participants whole who had lost money on transactions.   Or else the loss of some businesses who revise their estimates of how risky it is to do business in bitcoin and rethink their strategies.

You will want to combine the block hash with an unpublished nonce that was provably generated before the wins and losses were calculated for the block.  If you don't then the miner that calculates the resulting block will be able to add a bet that is only included if it wins.
You can publish the nonce after the wins and losses are calculated to prove that the game is fair (again assuming you have linked the nonce to an earlier point in the blockchain in some way.  If you can't prove the age of the nonce then you could calculate one that is of benefit to the house post hoc.)

No, I don't think they 'lost some coins'.   Any attack on Blockchain that could take bitcoins would require assistance from the wallet owner since the only place that private keys are ever decrypted are on the client side of the web browser connection when using a blockchain wallet.
That design just doesn't lend itself to any kind of mass scale loss of bitcoin, and anyone who loses bitcoin would know it because it would be obvious in their own wallets.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:56:59
In all likelihood the value of those bitcoins will grow at a pace that won't be possible to reimburse in the same units.  It simply wouldn't be feasible.  
Let's say that 750k BTC are missing from MtGox.  Right now in order to pay that back in Bitcoin would probably exceed $1B, and that bill will only get more expensive year by year.
If MtGox were in banking then they might have loans out totaling some percentage of total deposits and be operating on a fractional reserve, but in that case they would have debts owed to them that were secured by whatever due diligence they had done before offering those loans.  In this case what they presumably have are business records showing accidental 'loans' to scammers whose ability to repay their take is at best speculative.
What I expect MtGox to do is offer to buy out unredeemable Bitcoin at a set rate based on the last trade price on their own exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:45:03
But what can you do with the money that money?
Let's say that if MtGox invested $10M they could get a profit of at least $30M by selling any bitcoins they buy on their own exchange on another market.   
What can they do with $30M.   If they put it back into the exchange and buy more bitcoins then they have just increased their liability and don't have the cash to spend any longer.
If they hold onto the $30M and use it for business expenses then they just spent $10M to buy bitcoins that were already in their possession and that they could have sold without putting any money into the market at all.   
Backup up a level, if they just appropriate the bitcoins and sell them then they aren't worth as much to their own customers as if they buy them and sell them, so their liability is lower if they take them than if they pay for them.   If it comes to shuttering the exchange, it is less expensive for them to leave the price per bitcoin at ~$200 than lift it up and end up owing more $/bitcoin to their users.
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:39:20
The effect on exchanges is indirect.  Buyers who might be headed to an exchange might instead be able to buy elsewhere.  If Coinbase buys up a couple of blocks of bitcoin at some discount and then sells them to their users, those become transactions that never make it to Bitstamp.
Or maybe they only redirect half of their sales to their own cache when they represent at least a 20% margin, so that pricing on the exchange continues to be supported by a part of the incoming customer purchases.  In that case the exchange price drops more slowly, depending on what proportion of business has been redirected.
There are a lot of possible outcomes, and they depend heavily on who the buyers are and how they plan to use their purchases.

I think I understand the journalistic ethics problem they were trying to resolve, but by destroying the keys they also weren't really reviewing the hardware they received.

The obvious way would be to add a 'watch only' address to a blockchain wallet.   It would appear to have an active balance and you would be able to send bitcoins from it up until it asked you to supply the private keys needed to sign the transaction.
Verifying that the seller is holding the keys (such as by signing a message using the private key) would help to mitigate the problem, but really blockchain wallets are not designed to be transferred reliably from one person to another.

Bitcoin is exchangeable to and from cash or cash equivalents.  To get bitcoin you can either offer goods or services payable in bitcoin, or else exchange some cash for bitcoin.

Honestly, level 2 verification is a mixed blessing anyway.

If the people being affected by the central bank statement had their savings in bitcoin then they wouldn't be interested in buying cars in the first place.   The whole point of buying a car (in Argentina) is to protect your savings from inflationary depreciation at a rate faster than the depreciation of the car itself.
The problem for Argentinians is that they need to get their cash out of Pesos and into something else, but there aren't that many things that they can buy for Pesos.  Cars sellers used to accept Pesos because the government would exchange Pesos for USD at about 10x the market rate (imagine it costs $4000 a week for groceries, but only $200 a week for a car payment due to fixed exchange rates.)

Coinbase's assessment of high risk trades probably doesn't have anything to do with your debit card, your credit history, etc.   It is just their own custom fraud finding program that has a lot of false positives, and could be based on something a trivial as that the previous three times you logged in were in the afternoon, but the time you made a purchase was late at night.  Or vice versa.   Or some other random bit of trivia.
I would suggest trying again, and contacting support and politely informing them that the previously canceled purchase really was authorized by you, and was caught by their fraud detection erroneously.  They might even whitelist your purchases.

IIRC BTCGuild will let you withdraw any amount you mine provided you pay your own withdrawal fee and that it isn't otherwise prevented as a dust transaction.   So in theory it would take the OP about 5 days of mining to cover a minimal .0001BTC withdrawal fee, followed by another half day or so for the penny.   
Of course once he had the penny he still wouldn't be able to spend it.   For that he would have to transfer another .0001BTC to his account, so let's add another 5 days.  Thus for a spendable penny he would need about 11 days of mining on his equipment.

Apples and Oranges.   The credit card 3% fee includes the encompasses the entire cost of operating the credit card network, all transaction processing, fraud, and all fraud prevention.
An equivalent comparison for Bitcoin should include the block rewards which go to support the network of miners and which dilute the value of every Bitcoin.
Yes, the original poster's point is disingenuous since he is complaining not that he is paying ourageous fees, but that he is paying 'more than he ever paid in bank or credit card fees' which he says are -$50/mo.   Even though bitcoin has every chance of becoming more efficient than the overall credit card industry, right now our network costs a quite high for the amount of money we move every day.
But to me the most important feature distinguishing Bitcoin from legacy banking is that it is Free as in Freedom.  There are no barriers to the movement of Bitcoin, so it can and will move anywhere that there is an Internet.

In two years Flooz burned through ~$50M in VC funding.   At the time of the dotCom boom the main worry for most startups was that they would be beaten to the market by someone else, so a large proportion of every development budget was assigned to marketing.
Bitcoin has no organized marketing at all.  Some few individuals have bought billboards here and there, and companies like Bitpay, who stand to profit from new customers, go out and actively seek businesses who are willing to add a new payment system, but I doubt that everything combined comes close to the marketing muscle of a dedicated startup marketing team.

The Byzantine Generals problem is a question of how to generate trust when everyone is only out for themselves.  
The solution used in Bitcoin is to create a system in which every participant in the trust generating mechanism (but one) has an incentive to use confirm the same transactions, and only one participant has an incentive to confirm an alternative transaction.
Moreover, every participant has an incentive to build on top of already confirmed transactions rather than revise and rebuild the transaction tree because only the longest/hardest chain will be used by the clients and only fees and awards that are in the longest/hardest chain will have any value.

Units of Bitcoin don't really ever get sent anywhere, so sending them to offline storage is just as easy as sending them to any other address.  
The only time you need access to the private keys in your wallet is when you want to be able to spend some of the coins that the blockchain says you own.  At that point you have to be able to sign a message that is formatted correctly that authorizes the transfer of some of your bitcoins (listed on the blockchain) to someone else's address (still listed on the blockchain).   If you can sign that message and get it by some means to the peer-to-peer mining and blockchain sharing network then you have completed the receive/send loop.

Instant transfers in the legacy banking market are kind of a lie.  What they really mean is that you are being given credit until the actual transfer can be completed, and that introduces all kinds of failure points.  
What happens when you 'instantly' transfer $10k to Coinbase from your bank account, and then an hour or two later 'instantly' transfer $12k from Coinbase to your bank account?   
The answer is that you have $22k locked up in ACH transfers that won't complete for up to a week, but which appear to have been credited so you can't accurately figure out what your balance is.  If something goes wrong with one of the ACH transactions you might be stuck with a surprise loan fee, and in any case you are stepping close to whatever credit limits the institutions will offer, so your money is actually only pseudo accessible, not really transferred.
I do think it would be desirable for Coinbase to hold USD deposits in order to avoid the need for ACH transactions that you might plan on quickly reversing.

Actually I tend to agree, but to someone who has money on MtGox the problem for them is that the current price movement can't be entirely explained by the withdrawal problems.
If MtGox had frozen trading while the problem was being worked, there would have been a hiatus followed by an immediate attempt to catch up with the market.  Given that trading was still continuing, it is probably very difficult to decide whether MtGox is artificially flooding its own market with Bitcoins that they don't have, if the bitcoin balance being traded before the closure was already in short supply, or what.
And since there is no distinction between pre-closure BTC and post-closure BTC not trading isn't really an option.   
The reopening of the market will probably give strong indicators as to which is really the case.  If like the fiat withdrawals, BTC is 'temporarily' restricted to small amounts 'while the bugs are worked out and the new code is tested' then Gox users will probably see that as an indicator that the numbers in their own accounts are meaningless.   And like monetary controls everywhere, the result will be monetary flight.

You can't do off blockchain transactions without a settlement protocol.  I suppose you could do off blockchain transactions and use ACH as your settlement protocol, but that would not be globally accessible, it would be subject to fraud, subject to money services licensing if you hold deposits from your users, and would take about a week and a couple of bucks to complete the settlement process.
Bitcoin as a settlement protocol for off-chain microtransactions has a lot of potential advantages.

Bitcoin isn't a fiat currency, so deflation has a somewhat different result on the bitcoin community than it does on communities that have deflation in their primary unit of exchange.
As bitcoin deflation takes effect, you, by continuing to hold on to your bitcoin, are increasing the buying power of anyone else in the network who needs to buy something now rather than later.   They convert less of their bitcoin to fiat in order to buy the product they are interested in, or are able to consider a much larger purchase than they otherwise would be able to.  
How well this will work out in the long term depends a little on how much those purchases add value to the community, and how much is used to just siphon value out of the community and into other things.   
My current belief is that the people who are just in it for the money are also the ones who get out of the market first and thus have the smallest relative impact on the community as a whole.  Anyone who has tons of bitcoin (relatively speaking) also has a strong incentive to increase the value of the market as a whole, and thus an incentive to create new services with the bitcoin that they relinquish.
Whether this is sustainable or not I don't know.  I do think that we need to gain some kind of control over bitcoin theft though.  Value departure as a result of bitcoin theft is IMHO very unlikely to be of benefit to the community.
Digression aside, I think that it would make more sense to compare the internal bitcoin economy to that of a collective, or of a commune.   Efficiency of the collective as a whole has a much more substantial impact on its economy than whether the internal economy is inflationary or deflationary, whereas the voluntary nature of joining or exiting this particular community means that it will never be worth more than the sum of its market services plus its speculative value.

MtGox has a surplus of cash left over from making it impossible to withdraw USD, thus prices are higher there.   BTC-e and CampBX are both a bit careless with your USD deposits, so people tend not to want to put a lot of money there, and prices are thus lower.  BitStamp and Coinbase are the most liquid exchanges at present for Europe and the US respectively, although in the case of Coinbase you can't really call it an exchange as it just brokers buys and sells through other exchanges.

Excellent, I see we are mostly in agreement then.
Corruption of all types is damaging to society, but regulatory capture, which is the type of corruption that leads to decisions that banks can be 'too big to fail' is particularly pernicious in the US.
I am probably a bit less worried than you are about the size of government *per se*, but there is room for a lot of different experimentation for addressing a humane approach to dealing with crime and poverty if we can get the graft under control.
On the other hand, advising people to break the law is, as I see it, a corrupt social stance.   It does absolutely nothing to reduce government corruption, but extends that corruption into the lives of the people.   I speed on the way to work just like everyone else, but I don't pretend that this small and selfish act improves our society.

If it were to happen entirely off blockchain then that is true, but for microtransactions the cost is in making repeated changes to the blockchain.  At the cost of one start transaction and one end transaction an arbitrary number of off blockchain transactions can be completed without the need for a third party.
For example I could start a transaction at the beginning of the month and close it out at the end of the month, with all transactions that were conducted in the mean time integrated into the open transaction. The way that a client like Bitcoin-QT would present such a transaction is in development, but the underlying bitcoin protocol is quite flexible.

Can you explain what kind of problem you are having?
If you have read the code successfully you should have a code that starts with '5' that is your private key for spending the coin.  You can import that key into bitcoin-qt from the debug console.  Other clients have their own means for adding private keys directly.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:30:39
There is a hash (actually a pair of hash functions) associated with the public keys, but they are used to make the public key smaller, and are not related to mining.
The mining hash values are calculated over the contents of the block, which are transactions.  These include public addresses, signatures, inputs, outputs, and scripts which are about a kilobyte per transaction typically.

In the case of Bitcoin-QT what this means is that although it will look as though you have a new address the client will also keep track of your old address and your wallet will include payments to any of your addresses.
Different wallets can behave differently, but none of them should be throwing away private keys.

Honestly, this sounds more like a personal trust issue than a bitcoin issue, but to answer your question, you don't try to convince someone to buy in to bitcoin if they don't want to.
You give them information and let them decide for themselves how much they want to be involved and whether they want to risk anything at all on this.  
I find myself more often in the position of discouraging friends and family from taking a position at a bad time in the market.  For what it is worth I have personally been buying back in over the last couple of weeks and if the news from MtGox sends more shudders through the market the price to buy in will drop even lower, so I actually think that this is a reasonable time to invest, but I still wouldn't try to convince someone else to take on risk that they don't need or want.

He is obviously confused by something.  Blockchain doesn't manage your wallet, rather it sends javascript that implements a wallet in your browser.  As a result there simply isn't any way for Blockchain per se to fail to credit some deposit to you since if you sent it to the right address you will receive it there.  
The possibilities as I see it are that he mistook Blockchain for someone else, which could either be some other online wallet, or else someone who has an imitation web site for the purposes of intercepting bitcoins, possibly assisted by cache poisoning, DNS overrides hacked into his system, or a MITM attack.
Alternatively he may have been using a passphrase generated address that had been previously used by someone else and simply sent his bitcoins to some other address not represented in that wallet.
Or as another alternative someone might have injected some malicious javascript into his browser session by means unknown and be showing a simulation of the blockchain wallet that is generating nonsense.
And, admittedly, he may just be too stoned to read numbers.

Most people on this list who don't have a vested interest in getting you to behave in one way or another will just advise that Bitcoin is risky and that you shouldn't invest more than you are willing to lose.
I would hesitate to accept advice from anyone who is either trying to depress the price or trying to pump it.  No doubt there are people who will use any means at their disposal to try and convert whatever position they are currently holding into one that make sense.   If you aren't holding bitcoins then you want the price to go down.  If you are then you want them to go up.  If you can help the market out by a denial of service attack or whatever then there is probably someone who will.
What most of us do though is ignore them.  They might get a moderate up or down swing, but over the longer term it is just bullying and flim-flam.

It is really a question of how you expand the monetary base.  Any currency needs to expand its monetary base to cover all of the extant uses of the currency.  For Bitcoin the decision to limit growth to 21M bitcoins means that as the monetary base expands any increases in value will essentially be spread out over the then current stakeholders.
Much like PPCoin's proof-of-stake, Bitcoin absorbs value and distributes it over all of the coins in existence.   An alternative approach would favor mining as the point where new monetary base is distributed, but ultimately Bitcoin's goal was to reduce the value of mining to the minimum needed to protect the blockchain.

I think that the risk of insolvency is what is driving the panic among MtGox users.   As to the actual state of their finances, I have no opinion, and no data to base one upon.   The $1M USD estimate may not be very useful to MtGox though if the fees were all from deposits already present in their accounts and not from new deposits.
Bitcoin, as a commodity, is kind of unforgiving compared with other traded commodities.  Any bitcoin that they have lost over the years will eventually be noticed as withdrawals continue, and the only choice they have to replace those losses are either to supply them from their own savings, or to buy them on the open market (or I suppose they can buy them back from their own users).

It is an artifact of how payments actually work in Bitcoin.  To make a payment a set of input transaction have to be referenced in a new transaction that creates a set of outputs.  Each of the input transactions must be spent in full so for a simple payment the standard Bitcoin-QT client sends outputs to two addresses, one for the payment, and the remainder to a new address that holds any funds left over from the payment (the change).   
Input transactions tend to be chosen from small to large, combining as many inputs as needed to make the payment.  As a result your 0.00008 BTC will end up being combined as an input for your next payment, but since 0.00008 is too small to be used as a mining fee and is smaller than the typical payment amount, it will go to your change address thus indicating which of the two output addresses is yours.
Over time as the .00008 BTC hops from transaction to transaction it will tend to link together your accounts giving someone who is interested an idea of which accounts are related to one person.  
Of course you can spend the 0.00008 BTC as easily as you can spend any amount, but the transaction fee will be higher than the amount spent so not very many people will do that.   Some clients will allow you to mark certain inputs as to be avoided, so you could try using that feature if you have an appropriate client.  Alternatively you could just bump up your transaction fee to e.g. 0.00018 BTC for your next payment.

Coinbase is designed for consumer use.  They expect users to make small somewhat regular purchases, and have typical banking relationships.   Any attempt to avoid the limits they set for things like instant purchases, etc., will dump you in a high risk category.   Any odd behavior may put you in high risk, especially if that same behavior has been linked to scammers in the past.   Any purchase they consider high risk can be canceled and often is.
The best strategy for buying from Coinbase IMHO is to buy when the market is flat for a couple of days, and in amounts that are reasonable for your income, your credit rating, and your current savings.
The reason I recommended using an exchange is that you won't have to deal with the chancy nature of Coinbase's 'maybe you aren't trustworthy enough to place this purchase, but I won't tell you about it until later' type of business.  Coinbase is useful, but not for real trading, just for a more convenient way to move money slowly into and out of the market without the international wire transfer.

The idea of scam chargebacks costing 10% is that a merchant who sells product to a scammer is out both the product and the payment for that product.   Scammers aren't expected to continue ordering that they can't pay for.   At the same time, bitcoin promotes saving rather than immediate gratification, so the overall impact on the planet of a complete adoption of bitcoin would also likely include a reduction of manufacturing capacity, or more likely just a reduction in the rate of expansion of manufacturing capacity, with consequent contraction of the economy and follow on reduction in the environmental harm caused by excess production.
The way that the community deals with customer disputes right now is by reputation.  A vendor who makes promises, accepts payments, and then refuses to refund payments when those promises are broken engenders distrust from the community and cannot do business long term.
For a vendor with a long history of adding value to the community who suddenly experiences problems leading to inability to perform will likely be handled by the court system, as it is in the case of MtGox.
But in a wholly bitcoin world, the customers will probably put more faith in quality than in volume.

That is a different problem.  Since the Bitcoin block chain is fully public there is no way to get someone off your trail if you are being chased other through obfuscation.

If I buy your Bitcoins and liquidate them, and then someone with a gun comes up to my house and asks me politely where I got the Bitcoins from, I'd be tempted to point them to the transaction I sent to you, which would put you right back in the same situation you were in to start with.

One possibility that might work would be to alternate between two or more different proof of work algorithms (for example every even block is SHA256, every odd block is Scrypt'').   The result, I think, would be to extend the likelihood of having a different market leader within each specific proof of work group.  GHash might dominate SHA256, but the specialized hardware required to do so would tend to find a different market leader for successive proof of work algorithms, and if there are enough variants in the algorithms it becomes infeasible to specialize in each area individually.

Double spending doesn't create new coins.   It steals coins from someone who believed you were sending them and gives them to a different wallet instead.
The only way to create new coins is to mine them, and with 51% of the network hashing power you actually could mine 100% of the new coins on the network (by ignoring any blocks not mined by your own cartel).   To do so you would have to maintain a 51% majority of the mining power for about 228 days, of which the first twenty would be mined at half speed (assuming 51% of the network hash rate), and after which you would mine at full speed assuming the network adjusts difficulty downward to match the 51% that you are controlling the network with.
The cost of such an attack would likely exceed the value of the bitcoins obtained by a considerable margin.

This is an interesting point of view, but I disagree both with the premise and the conclusion.  The majority of the value of Bitcoin may be speculative, but the core value comes from the market it serves and the goods and services that are dependent upon it.  I can't think of a mechanism for converting to an alt-coin that would preserve that core of investments, and certainly not in the time span you are suggesting would be required.  
And without that infrastructure there just isn't any basis for the speculative value, so I don't think that the value would transfer to an alt-coin either.  If it were really dire enough to be imminent and fatal then the end result would be a flight to fiat not to an alt-coin.

My first guess would be that it is someone doing independent research.   Market cap is a really dicey way of estimating the total size of the Bitcoin marketplace.  By doing some tracing I expect someone is trying to figure out how much Bitcoin is really worth.   It is certainly something that I have wondered about (to less effect).

One proposed solution is to discount the difficulty of chains that don't include high priority transactions, the theory being that one type of abuse that a 51% miner can enact is to prevent high priority transactions from ever getting into the block chain.  (Priority here is defined as in the whitepaper, containing a mix of age of the inputs and the number of bitcoins being transacted, diminished by the size of the transaction in bytes.)
Another solution, and the one that has actually been put into effect was to ask GHash.io nicely to limit their user base, and for miners to move to other mining pools.

Exactly.  I trust Coinbase with my bitcoin about 90%.  I trust myself to create and use paper wallets correctly 99%, and I trust my ability to keep my hot wallet machine virus free 85%.  Thus while I don't rush to move bitcoin off of Coinbase the minute they are available, I also don't leave them there indefinitely.  I do move some to my hot wallet because Coinbase has been known to be slow when generating payment transactions, but I keep that down to petty cash levels.

In order to interact with the non-bitcoin financial world, bitcoin markets have to sustain a liquidity pool.   Trades between bitcoin and USD that happen within that liquidity pool have no impact on the size of the liquidity pool.  Buying bitcoin as an outsider adds to the liquidity pool.  Selling bitcoin for conversion to USD in order to withdraw it decreases the size of the liquidity pool.
I can't make it any simpler than that.   If you think that the trades within the pool take money away from the pool you are in error.

If you create a new premined crypto currency with a billion units and I buy one from you for $10 then the market cap for your currency will instantly become $10 billion, thereby outshining even Bitcoin.
Market cap is just a stupid way to measure the size of any currency.  So why should anyone care what Coinmarketcap says?   At best it will let you know when the value of the currency is inflated relative to its market size, but the real value of any currency is in the market that it supports, not in its total valuation.

Once the code is written implementing the new hashing function it would go into new clients as they are released and downloaded by users but not be in use until a specific block number is reached.   Or alternatively clients could write their transactions as unlockable using either of two hashes
When the blockchain hits block  every client that has been updated since the new code was implemented would start writing their transactions using the new hashing algorithm.   Anyone who hadn't updated their clients would be encouraged to do so by an increasing inability to receive and spend transactions written using the new hashing algorithm.
After some point if SHA256 is sufficiently broken it might become important to disable transactions secured with that algorithm.   Perhaps clients could first automatically sweep any balances that are secured by SHA256 into a more secure wallet.   Later miners might stop accepting scripts containing the SHA256 opcode as valid transactions, depending on how many dead bitcoins are flooding the market.

Wealth doesn't come from empty air though.  Someone has to work to build the BMW, the house, and the margaritas, which really means that someone has to be willing to work in exchange for bitcoin in order for bitcoin to have value.  
The risk of hoarding isn't that you won't ever spend it, but that the redemption value exceeds the labor put into the system.  It that were to happen then the value would decline until consumption is consistent with input, absent a new round of adoption or investment from external sources.

Welcome to the world of cryptography.   If you know the secret you can read the message.  If you don't know the secret you can guess it and read the message.
In that kind of environment how do you protect a message from random attack?   There could be hundreds of millions of random messages, so obviously there are hundreds of millions of chances to match any key you care to try.
The answer is to make the key that much harder to guess.   If there are 30 bits worth of hidden keys that have been generated and you want at least 100 bits worth of difficulty in finding a key, then you expand the range of guessing from 100 bits to 130 bits to hide any of the billion odd addresses from being guessed by a factor of 2^100.
In practical terms you can bury any amount of data in any amount of entropy to make it arbitrarily difficult to find.  For Bitcoin, the authors chose to use 256-bit ECC keys that have been hashed into a 160-bit RIPEMD data space.   There are 21x10^14 Satoshi, so if each Satoshi were to be placed in its own address the largest number of addresses that could be generated and hold value would fit in 47-bits, leaving about 2^113 addresses to sift through in order to find one Satoshi.

This is a interesting problem, and one that I have been thinking about in part for a couple of months now.  
I'm pretty sure that it is possible to solve the distributed reputation problem in a way that substantially duplicates the features of a centralized reputation system by using voluntary assignment of the tracking of agreement or contract progress to a set of escrow agents (enabled through multisignature transactions to reverse or fulfill completion of a contract) each of whom also places some of their own reputation at risk by acting as agents, and who can authenticate that real business took place between two parties.
I think that public distributed discussions are already a solved problem provided that the goal isn't to keep them private, but merely to allow them to happen.
The voting problem might be solvable by a combination of reputation and burning bitcoin days as a limited resource.   This admittedly is at risk of gaming as wealthy individuals could maintain separate anonymous high-reputation pseudonyms and still have enough unspent bitcoin-days to invest each pseudonym with a vote, but fair voting may be a best-effort kind of problem.
Do you have a place set up for architectural discussions?

That thread is slightly misleading.  While it points to one state department document that lists a bunch of specifically prohibited businesses, it doesn't point to the more general policy document that makes it illegal to import nearly everything from Iran and sets the fines and jail time associated with those.
I, as a non lawyer, read the rules as follows:
1. You can't import or export anything.
2. There are some general licenses to import a few things; food, medical equipment, drugs, some types of computing equipment, anything made by Monsanto, etc, despite the general prohibition.
3. There are some general licenses that apply to a few specific groups.
4. Oil exported from Iran and then turned into retail goods in other countries can be imported into the US.
5. But you can't import to this set of listed businesses regardless of the general licenses.

It isn't a question of what it is possible to do, but how likely you are as a business owner to have a serious problem.  
If you accept checks you have to accept the risk that they might be forged, or that the account balance might be empty.  If you accept credit cards you may get chargebacks on forgeries or on false credentials.  Most small businesses around here keep lists of customers posted at the registers of people who can't be trusted.  On the other hand, I've walked into my local feed store in the past having left my wallet on the mantle at home, and walked out with everything I went to buy and an IOU in the register that I have returned to pay off the same day.
The thing is, it doesn't take that much trust to sell a cup of coffee.  Just a little bit is enough because the downside of not selling a cup is almost as bad as the downside of having the payment withdrawn later.
I don't put cars in quite that same category.

Purse.io has an interesting business model, but it looks like an incredibly strong fraud magnet.
Stolen credit card or Amazon account gets converted to goods sent to a third party in exchange for bitcoin.   When Amazon or the FBI finally gets around to tracking down the shipped-to information all they find is someone who received goods in exchange for untraceable currency.   Purse.io never holds any currency (since bitcoin isn't a currency), so they never have to collect KYC info, and in any case the person who originally used the credit card is long gone.
This is all hypothetical of course, but think of two other good reasons for paying a 20%-80% premium when buying bitcoin (based on a 15%-45% discount for the bitcoin seller).

If you want passive income generating cash then you are better off not choosing an income source that drops in value logarithmically over time.  As long as the difficulty continues to grow exponentially, the value of a plain Bitcoin investment will always outstrip the value of a mining equipment investment with minor caveats.
If you can get your hands on next generation hardware before anyone else, or if you can get someone else to pay for your hardware then you might be able to make enough money mining to cover any increase in Bitcoin valuation.   This is all assuming that Bitcoin doesn't drop in value though.  If there is a significant drop then mining really can't pay off as exponentially more equipment is competing for a share of a smaller overall prize.  On the other hand, if Bitcoin is rapidly increasing in value then you will have to generate at least enough bitcoin to cover your investment expense in Bitcoin to beat the invested value you would have had if you had purchased Bitcoin instead.
All in all it is very risky.   Either way Bitcoin value moves you stand to lose out.
In the interest of full disclosure, I have about 8GH worth of Butterfly Labs mining equipment that has paid for itself in USD but which is running about $2500 below what the same investment would have returned as a Bitcoin investment.

You can't day trade on Coinbase.  Open an exchange account (Bitstamp or BTC-e come to mind) and trade there.
If you've been reading books on day trading, I would suggest forgetting them.   Don't ever use stop loss trades.  If you start feeling that you should use a stop loss you are over invested.   Don't ever use leveraged purchases.   Don't ever short sell (assuming you can find exchanges that support it.)  
Bitcoin has more than enough volatility built in to satisfy any trading strategy you care to devise, you don't need to up the ante with any of the other tools that are used in the stock market.
Lastly, when you start feeling that this is a great time to buy you should probably be selling.  When you start feeling so depressed that you think you should really sell off your remaining bitcoin and take the loss you should probably be buying.   Getting in over your head will make it hard to take this last bit of advice, so don't get in over your head.

This just isn't true.  The miners don't make up the rules of the network, and no full bitcoin client nor any other miner would consider blocks that contain an unlimited number of bitcoins to be valid blocks, so the entire hashing power of GHash.io would go to waste if what they produced were invalid blocks.
The problem with 51% is that the order of transactions on the block chain becomes mutable.  Someone with more than half of the network power can go back in time, pick a block, and working forward from there include as many transactions from the original blockchain and as many as desired from some alternate set of signed transactions and eventually catch up with the end of the block chain.
Eventually could obviously be a long time if the attacker decided to start very far back, but for a short span of time, say ten or twenty minutes, someone with 51% could be reasonably certain of reversing a bet (effectively unpaying the casino) within a couple of hours.

You've missed the point.  
Buys and sells are paired as trades are completed, but 'buying bitcoin' as someone investing the the market, or to spend it in a bitcoin only marketplace adds USD into the market.   That cash will be in the hands of some other individual who may leave it there to increase his or her reach thereby increasing the pool depth.   Otherwise, as people with money in the market decide to withdraw it the pool depth is decreased, but you can judge the effective pool depth at any point in time by looking at the order book.
The real world markets that Bitcoin is able to address are effectively limited by the rate at which money can be transferred in or out in a full loop, factored with the depth of the pool (and of course the willingness of merchants to accept bitcoin as a payment option).

Backed isn't really how I would describe it.  The community imbues faith that the currency is worth some amount and won't sell below that amount, so that is what it is worth.   As bad news comes along people who are primarily interested in Bitcoin for speculative value lose faith that it is currently valued correctly and sell, creating a dip in the price.  As newcomers arrive the price is driven upward and some people will sell part of their stake as the price crosses boundaries of what they are personally willing to bank that their own Bitcoin is worth.
But the true backing of Bitcoin, I believe, is in the market that it serves.   The goods and services that are dependent on Bitcoin as a means of exchange give it its real value because the Bitcoin network only trades in Bitcoin.

Check the transaction number and see if it has been transmitted to the network (blockchain.info will have it listed if it has been seen).  
I don't believe there is an outstanding queue of transactions right now though, so given that the transaction hasn't been added it either got lost before being included in the blockchain, or else never got transmitted to begin with.
MtGox can be singularly unhelpful though in resolving issues in their UI.   If you had the private key I'd just suggest sending a second transaction to supercede the first.  Without the private keys you really have to work it through MtGox.

If you show up at a Satoshi Square without any advance notice that you want to buy on the order of $60k then there won't be enough liquidity present.

Personally I buy on Coinbase for ease of interaction, but even with Level 2 verification, buying $60k feels chancy in a small number of transactions.

Think about it.   If Bitcoin is itself appreciating in value then its own volatility means that there is no other investment that can keep up with it.   Whatever anyone borrows Bitcoin to do, they will go on to convert their borrowed value into cash, do something, and then try to buy back Bitcoin to repay the loan.
That works fine when Bitcoin is dropping in value (I borrowed $10k, but I only have to repay $8k, yay) but is unachievable in an up market (I borrowed $10k, and now I have to repay $10k + $4k (interest) + $8k (appreciation in Bitcoin) or $22k total.

This is mostly true if you choose random keys.  If your keys are not random because you are using a brain wallet, or a deterministic wallet, or your random number generator was compromised in some way, or you exposed your ECC key by signing a bad transaction then it could take as little as a couple of seconds to crack your key.  
The brute force approach attacks the strongest feature of Bitcoin private keys; there are many weaker features that might be worth exploring instead.    But even perfectly random 256bit ECC keys are widely regarded to be only about as strong as a 128bit symmetric key, which NIST estimates will be considered insecure by 2031.

If spread out over the course of a year a billion dollar investment would raise global trade in bitcoin by about 5%, and at the current valuation would take more than a million coins out of circulation, or about 10% of the current monetary base.   
I think the only effect such a change could have is to create enough price pressure to send bitcoin up a couple of orders of magnitude in valuation.
I can't imagine though what Apple would get out of such an investment.  When they tried to liquidate they would just end up buying back their own money unless other similarly ginormous investors came along with them.  Otherwise they would have to have some particular in house use for Bitcoin.

What is unfair is leading your sister to believe that she will be able to count on a certain amount of money when she turns 21 instead of giving her the facts that she needs in order to plan her life.
If you want to risk it all on a big payout then you at least have to let her know that she can't count on it being available.  She might be making plans based on having a lot of money available that just aren't feasible.   Starting her own business for example, or putting a down payment on a flat in San Francisco, or pursuing a graduate degree.   By hiding financial information from her you make it impossible for her to plan her own life realistically.

It depends.  Coinbase mostly executes their sales using the Bitstamp exchange.  Bitstamp occasionally runs with a pretty wide trading zone, so you might simply be encountering that.  But more to the point, Coinbase is intended as simple and easy to use source for Bitcoin, usable by either your Grandmother or your teen daughter without much coaching.
If you want to be able to actually trade cash for bitcoin with some awareness of what the market is doing, I suggest moving money to an actual exchange and executing your trades there.   There is no margin trading, and no short sells (other than a mostly broken pretense of shorts at BTC-e), but other than that it should look pretty familiar.

I think the common belief is that the price drop is due to the troubles at MtGox.  With MtGox locking USD cash withdrawals any withdrawal involving extracting USD has to move to another exchange or else incur the double penalty of extracting e.g. EUR, and then converting to USD.   So a lot of sales have had to move off of MtGox, less money is available from the other exchanges, so they are depressed.  Any cash deposited into MtGox can't be retrieved, and the price there is higher than anywhere else anyway, so it seems pointless to put a lot of money into the market right now.  Basically the MtGox problems suck down the value.
But another part of the equation that I think is overlooked is that there is also a lot of new business development going on in the Bitcoin community right now, and at least some of that is being funded by investors with Bitcoin holdings, so as cash is withdrawn to support the venture operations the value will also be depressed until the new ventures develop cash influx at least sufficient to offset the cost of operations.

To me it looks like they are setting out the terms under which the device operates, which essentially includes a 50% markup over spot which is to be split 30% for the operating company and 20% for Robocoin until the purchase price is paid off, at which point the entire 50% markup will be allocated to the operating company.
How much markup seems reasonable for convenience purchases?   50% seems a bit high to me.   For an all cash transaction you would expect something more akin to 5% at most.

The first spike was pretty clearly led by BTC China and followed about two months after extensive positive media coverage there, previously discussed on this list.
The first spike ended when BitStamp customers got spooked by two days of spotty performance and half a day of downtime.  The other exchanges followed when BitStamp users moved their Bitcoin over to the alternative exchanges to improve liquidity, but cash can't be moved as quickly as bitcoin and the supply exceeded demand.
When BitStamp finally came back online a lot of very frustrated traders found that they could get much cheaper bitcoins than they had been expecting to buy, and jumped on the opportunity, dragging the other exchanges up with them, and boosting investor confidence into a second round.
I don't think that the new customers from the Senate hearings have even started showing up yet.  That is still in the future.

The aphorism for this situation is that you don't try to catch a falling knife.  If you aren't fully invested already then the best time to buy more is on the way back up.
Panic drives a sell-off down below the value that the market will eventually settle on, but there is no equivalent behavior on the way back up until you get to an investment runup.  The easiest time to buy and get a good price is as the price is in its slow recovery phase.   IMHO of course.
Buying more does allow you to lower your basis so that you don't have to wait as long to get back to even, provided that you still value the underlying market.

This is speculative supposition on my part, but it appears that their definition of high risk may be that they don't have the right kind of money in the right place to execute your trade.  I don't think that they purposely try to game you; if they did the number of reported problems would be much higher than it is.  But I do think that they sometimes quote a price based on the current trading rate at an exchange and afterward find that they can't actually execute a trade at the price they quoted you.
The way I think of it is that the price they quote you is what they will enter as a buy order soon-ish on one of the exchanges, possibly Bitstamp, and if it fails to execute they will refund your order but won't take the loss for you.  Fail to execute could be because the price moved between the time they quoted you and the time they actually had money in place to place the bid.  Failure to have money in place could easily be a result of the vague deadlines inherent in international wire transfers and a tendency to commit as much of their available cash to transactions as possible.
I doubt that the risk has anything to do with _you_ though.

It is very rare for a blockchain split to survive for more than one block.  Two blocks being solved at the same time is rare to start with.  Solving two at the same time, and then two more based on the first two at the same time would be daunting.
There was one blockchain split that survived for several hours.  It happened as a result of a split in the network opinion over which of the two forks was valid.  One side had less compute power but thought that the other side was invalid.  The other side had more compute power and thought that their side was valid.  As a result there were perhaps a dozen double spends that happened over the course of the split, and several transactions had to be untangled or reimbursed from community resources.
I hope not to see a problem like that arise again, though it is certainly possible.
Normally what happens is that if one transaction is on the blockchain then the other transaction will never make it into a block, it will be considered invalid to start with and no miner will include it.
If your input transaction has been confirmed three times, then to invalidate your transaction there would have to be a disagreement in the block chain about validity of blocks that survived for 30 minutes, and the input to your account would have to be different in each of those two branches.  
If your branch eventually lost out, then you would lose your bitcoins, and so would everyone else whose transactions were only listed on one of the two chains, including the person you sent your coins on to next.
But as above, that isn't the way the system is supposed to work, there is no incentive to do so for miners who lose a lot of money when the blockchain splits, and absent a bug in the source that affects different versions of the mining software in different ways, it shouldn't ever happen again.
Satoshi's 6 block recommendation wasn't meant to protect against the rare pair of blocks that are solved almost simultaneously, but against a concerted effort by a large number of miners to defraud someone.  
I don't think that small businesses need to worry about being conned by a mafia level organized attack on bitcoin.  If that happens they will have bigger fish to fry.

Usually the first indication you will have that someone has stolen your wallet is that your bitcoins are transferred unexpectedly to an account you don't control.   
At that point having a backup is pretty meaningless.  Indeed, I've never actually heard of anyone 'taking' a wallet by deleting the original copy.   
What is more likely is that someone will make a copy, then do a dictionary search for the encryption pass-phrase, and upon finding the right pass-phrase move all of the bitcoins that the wallet manages to a new wallet address.
Unless you catch on to the loss of the original file before the password is guessed you'll have no way of recovering your coins.

25MH is worth about $0.001/day of mining provided you can get work units small enough to participate.  To avoid stale packets you need work units that can be solved in at most a three to four minutes.  Since the world has moved on from that kind of workload you might have to look around a bit to find a mining pool that still uses the getwork protocol.

Right now, worst case, it would double the bitcoins in active trade, thus halving the price.  But the actual impact on price would probably extend much deeper as speculators drop out of the market to wait for it to restabilize.
All this assumes that whatever auction process the Fed sets up ultimately results in the coins making their way into the exchanges.  
If the coins were sold off in large blocks to companies with a foot in the market, like Coinbase or similar companies, then they would likely be liquidated over a much longer period to cover active purchases.  This would depress the market in the same way that mining inflates the currency decreasing the upward price pressure brought by the adoption curve.
However, since the Feds have said that they won't liquidate the seized bitcoins until the trial has been completed, the near term impact is solely on expected future value.

I would say that Bitcoin is primarily an open settlement process with a substantial but not yet enormous market attached to it of bitcoin dependent goods and services.   Whether it is currency or not is irrelevant since it can be traded in lieu of currency, and is readily convertible into currency in nearly every country in the world.
As far as the conversion to USD goes, as long as it is happening in the US and is being done by a business, it is subject to AML and KYC, so your wish is already granted.  
Outside the US most exchanges follow KYC to some degree or another.  In person exchanges by individuals are impossible to regulate, and thus pointless, to constrain, but the inefficiency of in person exchanges means that this will always be a more costly approach to exchanging bitcoin and thus less used.

If Coinbase loaned you the money for the transfer then the purchase was probably already completed on your behalf.

If you have a cancel option available then it will be because Coinbase was out of funds and offered to buy a bitcoin at the current market rate when your ACH transfer completes.
But to answer your question, you could probably get your bank to cancel the transaction.  (If you are in need of a good lie to tell your bank, you can always explain that you were browsing the website and left for dinner, and that the cat must have jumped on your keyboard while you were away.)

Most of my own negativity stems from looking at my bank balance and realizing that the money put into mining would have been 5-10x better if I had just bought bitcoin instead.
Bitcoin itself is growing in value quickly enough that getting a positive ROI in USD isn't all that rare.  Getting back the number of bitcoins you had to sell off to get the equipment though is very unusual.  And the information you would need in order to determine that your mining equipment order will never produce &gt;1 BTC or whatever, is main information that is kept private by every mining equipment manufacturer.

Bitcoin isn't really a currency so much as it is a market with an attached unit of exchange that is limited in volume and not fixed in price.   
People may decide to hold on to their Bitcoin balances against future need, but that doesn't prevent the investment of capital into the bitcoin marketplace.  Since the value of Bitcoin is derived from the market holding Bitcoin without investing in the market constrains the value of the Bitcoin you are holding.   Because Bitcoin is worth more the more you use it, there is a strong positive feedback loop for new investment.

Bitcoin balances are secured by public key cryptography.  Without the private key that corresponds to the public key it is impossible to transfer a Bitcoin balance from one key to another.   So depending on what exactly you mean by his lost backup, that balance will never be able to be transferred and are effectively lost for good.
If your friend has a backup of his wallet but it hasn't yet downloaded the complete block chain and he is seeing a zero balance on his client then that will automatically be fixed when the block chain download has been completed.
The wallet only contains your private keys.  Bitcoin balances are kept on the blockchain which is shared among all of the Bitcoin clients in the network, so as long as your private keys are backed up you will be able to see your balance again once the blockchain has fully downloaded.
The bitcoin-qt client uses a new keypair to hold the change from each transaction (this helps make transactions less traceable), so wallets that are more than a hundred transactions old may be missing parts of your balance since keypairs are generated in blocks of a hundred at a time.

Having bought coins from Coinbase for the last two weeks I get where you are coming from but, seriously?
What do you expect Coinbase to do?  They have to ask your bank for an exact amount of cash to start the transfer.  It takes a bank transfer about four days to clear so if they credited you before that you could buy without funds to back your purchase.
They have to buy your bitcoin when you ask for the purchase or they will get stuck with the additional cost when your payment clears.  Given bitcoin volatility there is much less risk for them in floating you a provisional loan for five days than in buying you a coin on the price from five days ago.
Personally I think they are pretty cool just for being willing to loan me up to about $1300 for five days for a 1% fee.  Sure I wish the banking system could clear transfers faster, but I don't gripe at Coinbase for the banking system's problems.  When bitcoin is going up in value the change is to my advange.  When it is going down I have the choice of halving my loss by investing more in bitcoin, or sucking up the loss because I knew what I was doing when I started the transaction.  
So be a man, take responsibility for your own decisions, invest wisely, and don't expect someone else to protect you from a 30% loss in your investment.

Yeah, same here.  With the cash I invested in mining hardware I could have doubled my initial investment in bitcoins, which would have paid back ten-fold over investing in mining hardware.  
Worse, since my overall goal is to develop a position in bitcoin, not in USD, even if the USD value of bitcoins increases, I will still come out behind because I can't possibly mine enough coins to cover the coins invested in mining hardware.
The only up side (for me) is that I'm only in the tinkering stage of investing so whether my basis is $100 or $200 is pretty irrelevant in the gross scheme of things.

The feather coin attack was &gt;51%, granted, but it is by no means limited to only situations where someone has more than half of the total compute power of the network.  As compute power drops below 50% the likelihood of winning the race to 10 blocks drops, but not at the same rate that the probability of winning each of ten races drops.
For example, at the 1/10th current difficulty (1 minute predicted intervals) someone with a 1TH capability at current difficulty should be able to win a race to 10 blocks with the rest of the network an average about once a day.

b.) The sum of the outputs is less-than or equal to the sum of the inputs.  
c.) The request to insert the transaction has been signed by the private key corresponding to a public key to which the input transactions were previously sent (this is one option, the actual evaluation is of a virtual machine which can execute a variety of operations.  As long as the VM exits with a success state the transaction is considered spendable).  
d.) The transaction to be added either comes from well aged transactions, or is for a large quantity of bitcoins, and the size in bytes of the transaction is not too large, or a mining fee has been offered to make including the transaction worthwhile.   (This rule tries to reduce spam in the blockchain.)
e.) Whatever I am forgetting.

You haven't really described the payment systems that you accept right now, but for someone who sells services within a community, if your customers aren't asking for the option then the main reason to accept Bitcoin would be because you want to.
There are some other considerations as well.   Clearing a payment doesn't take 60-90 days, or skim 4% to VISA.   You won't have to worry about bounced checks either, although you might worry about changes in the exchange rate if you need to pay for something now and your finances are tied up in Bitcoin and it happens to be a disadvantageous time to trade out.  But you could mitigate that risk by trading Bitcoin for USD or whatever as soon as you have been paid.
That said, most(*) small businesses that accept Bitcoin right now do so because the owners are interested in Bitcoin, or they have been asked by customers to accept Bitcoin.
 (*) No factual basis has been used in arriving at this opinion.

Are you asking about the blockchain or about Bitcoin-QT?   The blockchain is never pruned.  IIRC Bitcoin-QT keeps unspent outputs in a memory structure that it uses to verify new transactions sent through the network, and this structure has been slowly growing with time such that it is now quite large.  It has been suggested that the memory requirements of Bitcoin-QT could be reduced if some of the unspent outputs could be marked permanently unspendable.
Moving unspent outputs out of memory that haven't been used in a long time would weaken the protocol to denial of service attacks since the entire list would still have to be checked for each invalid transaction.

The blockchain is a record of all of the completed transactions. Each transaction links bitcoins from a set of inputs to a set of outputs and locks them so that only someone who is holding a particular key can create a new transaction using those transactions as input.   It protects the network from people who try to spend their bitcoins twice, writing valid transactions both times, but where only one of the two transactions can be accepted without invalidating the other.
Inputs reference other earlier transactions, and these chain backward until ultimately all bitcoins are accounted for as originating from a mined block reward.
Even if all of the miners decided to change the rules, the clients wouldn't accept the newly mined blocks without changes to the client source code, and a majority of users would have to adopt the new clients before it would be possible to spend bitcoins that had those attributes.  So they could mine 'em, they just couldn't use them without acceptance from the world of bitcoin users at large.

Paypal doesn't have any way to pay for bitcoins, and their policy is to shut down the accounts of anyone else who tries to offer bitcoins for sale who receives payment through Paypal.
In the USA, the most reliable way to get bitcoins in small quantities is Coinbase (coinbase.com), paid by electronic funds transfer (at a 1% markup over spot).  Alternatively you can look for someone local who has bitcoins for sale by going to Localbitcoins (localbitcoins.com), paid in cash, for about 10%-30% over spot.
If those don't appeal then many individual sellers on Etsy offer cottage industry goods in exchange for bitcoin, which you could do as well.  There is the beginning of an ebay-like marketplace that handles used goods auctions at 'bitmit.net', or you could offer your services on 'bitgigs.com'.

International wire transfers aren't usually something that you can set up online, you probably need to actually talk to your banker about it.  
There are a number of reasons for this.  Each time money crosses a political boundary it is subject to the laws of the jurisdiction it is entering, and that can make transfers prone to seizure if badly routed.  
Your banker may also want to warn you about being taken in by scams, etc.  Just explain that you are interested in investing, and want to transfer to an international exchange to have money in place for that investment.

For someone to truly be able to deliver an interest rate in bitcoin their business would have to be indexed in that same currency, and the regulatory structure for bitcoin indexed securities just isn't in place yet.  In essence you would be giving someone a completely unsecured loan on blind faith.

Typically the seller has to generate a different payment address for each sale in order to tie the transaction to a specific customer.
For this reason you should be wary whenever you have an address on file and only send Bitcoin to that address if you have first determined that the address is still one that the vendor is checking.   Likewise, if you are a vendor, it is very important to save all of your old addresses so that you can recover funds that were sent erroneously to an old address.

Ultimately, what difference does it make whether MtGox is solvent or not.   The price pressure is caused by having money stuck at the exchange regardless of the reason.
To put it differently, suppose MtGox hired an independent and well respected auditor to go over their books and show that they have assets far in excess of their liabilities.  The end result would only be that your money is still stuck in MtGox until they solve their banking problem.  And their banking problem is waiting on a six month or longer process of getting a new company up and running that is licensed as a money services broker so that they can reliably transfer USD to US citizens without having it seized by the Fed.

Nah, the engine just lost steam.  
Bitcoin generates a lot of press and a lot of interest when it starts going up in price.  People decide that they want in, and look up how to get Bitcoin.  It takes four to five bank days to authenticate a new account through Coinbase, and that is one of the fastest onramps.  Through Mt. Gox or Bitstamp it will be more like two weeks to complete the authentication and complete an international wire transfer.
This isn't anywhere close to playing out yet, at least not in my opinion, not that I really give a damn.  I'm in for at least a couple of years and while I'd appreciate a chance to add a little more balance to my portfolio, I'm not really expecting to have the chance to buy cheap coins again this cycle.
Give the banks a chance to open, the wire transfers a chance to complete, and I am pretty sure you'll see the whole thing repeating itself again next week.   
And if you are bored you can go through the daily open and close positions from the last runup.  I know it looks exponential from the long view, but from close up every three or four days there would be a down close or two.

The candlesticks represent a trading period, selected from the bar on the top, of from 1 minute intervals, to 1 week intervals.
Each candlestick contains five points of information.  The top whisker is the highest trade made during that period, and the bottom whisker is the lowest trade.   The body of the candlestick specifies the opening and closing prices.  If the color is red then the close will be the bottom, and the open will be the top.  If the color is green then the open will be the bottom and the close will be the top.  
When specifying an interval that is 30m or less, the right side of the chart will also contain a narrow view of the market depth.  The red line shows sells and the green line shows buys.
The two trend lines, one blue and one gold, are moving averages.  They simply average the price over several intervals (gold longer than blue), to give you a sense of where the bulk of trading has been.

Still with China losing steam combined with a bit of hyper sensitivity over the high prices in the current runup, I doubt the additional investment will drive prices upward so much as keep it from dropping for a couple of weeks.

Bitstamp (for example) did about 56000 bitcoins in trade today.  A hundred bitcoins wouldn't even be noise.
But taking your example to a higher level, if you wanted to exchange, say, $100,000,000 into or out of bitcoins you would have trouble doing so today, and even that is a paltry amount by the standards of Fortune 500 companies.   So in that sense, Bitcoin is too immature to cover use by large businesses at this point in time, which is why the current valuation of ~$600/ea will have to move up several orders of magnitude as it matures if it is to become a global currency. 
As for the overnight deadline to have money in your account, there is no mechanism for sending fiat currency in that timeframe other than courier delivery.   The bitcoins could be sent in about an hour to whoever you sell them to.  Then you would need to have a courier deliver the cash you receive to your bank.  Of course, this being a free country, actually depositing that much cash in your account might be a bit difficult.

Here is a nice article on the 11th circuit's ruling with regard to computer passwords:
For what it is worth though, I think that the article misses the point of how the court interprets fifth amendment protections.  In allowing that protection, self-incrimination must involve the revelation of the password itself, not the hard drive contents that are protected by the password.   In other words you have to demonstrate it is your password which may itself be construed as evidence of an illegal act.  The fifth amendment has never applied to the contents of the locked safe, only to the combination needed to access the safe.
In practice though it may not make a lot of difference to law enforcement.  If the court won't compel disclosure then law enforcement can install clandestine monitoring equipment to capture the password assuming they can obtain a search warrant (or a FISA search warrant).

Based on previous experience, I can almost certainly promise that you will very likely get delivery of the 600GH card that is scheduled to begin shipping next month before November 2014.
But the main problem with your calculator is that its estimate for decreased profitability year over year is laughably out of touch with reality.   Bitcoin difficulty has been increasing by a factor of 10 every 2-3 months, so the loss of profitability year over year could vary between 99.99% up to 99.9999%.  In other words as little as 10
 seconds of compute time at the beginning of the year could produce as much bitcoin as an entire day to trimester of compute time at the end of the year.

For now there isn't any support in the clients for double spending, although it can sometimes happen accidentally if you forget to update an offline client and there are coins in it that are associated with more than one wallet.   It is a pretty unusual scenario, but sometimes happens with paper wallets that are imported into multiple places, and you could go out of your way to make it happen if you knew what you were doing.
Trusting a black hat app to play with my money seems pretty far out, but I guess that is within the realm of reason as well, just not available yet as far as I know.   And even if it were available, the second spend would have to be added to the network with a higher payment reward quickly enough that it would have a chance of overtaking the first one.  Waiting five minutes would be too long about half the time.  It just wouldn't work very reliably, and the store owner would be alerted to the problem almost immediately.
For a high price physical item where the bulk of the cost is in the physical object, not in the services surrounding the object, I would definitely wait for at least one confirming block before letting the customer leave with it.   
Blocks only build on each other sequentially, and there is a disincentive to miners ignoring existing blocks when they solve their own blocks since the new block will only count if contains more difficulty than the block than any other possible chain.  
But in building the blockchain there are sometimes race conditions where two miners calculate blocks very nearly at the same time.  In this case either of the two blocks could reasonably be used as the basis for the next block in the chain, although in practice miners will still choose the block that happens to demonstrate more difficulty.
The rationale for waiting two blocks is that at that point it isn't feasible for a miner to come along and calculate two blocks in a row that supercede the existing two blocks that include your transaction.
But even with one block completed, and even if the block chain has split temporarily and your transaction was on the losing side, there is every reason for the miners to pick up the transaction in the next block.
In your case, how much time is there between the customer selecting their item, and the time that they leave the store normally?  I imagine that it takes a little time to secure it in its case, demonstrate the care of the instrument, verify that the case key works, and possibly fill in rebate forms or warrantee forms.   All of those can, I think, be reasonably moved to after the bitcoin payment is in progress when using bitcoin for a transaction.   Worst case they have to amuse themselves walking around the store poking through sheet music for a bit.

To manipulate the market at an exchange you would have to commit enough bitcoins to take effective control over the order list.   That would take something on the order of 20k bitcoins minimum per exchange, maybe ~60k across three exchanges to have a really noticeable impact.   Of course the net result might simply be that your sell off would simply be bought up at bargain prices and then you'd be buying back your stash at a big loss.

Bitcoin is a global shared ledger containing a bunch of signed transactions.  Each transaction references a set of inputs and a set of outputs.  When you spend bitcoin you are taking one or more of the signed transactions that assigned some bitcoin balance to you, and splitting it into a set of outputs.  Change is the part of the output that you send back to yourself so that you don't spend more than you intended to.  The outputs have to add up to no more than the inputs; and input quantity that isn't accounted for in the outputs is given to the miners as incentive to mine.  These are usually called transaction fees.
If you don't make change for yourself then you are limited to spending bitcoins in complete quantities of the transactions that you received them.  You can't partially spend a transaction.  Once you've signed its replacement the old transaction is superceded and no longer kept in memory.

To the OP; It is really easy to scare yourself with some of the things that Bitcoin-QT does without actually causing any harm.   Bitcoin-QT pregenerates about a hundred addresses that will be used to hold change when you make a transaction, and these are stored in any backup copies of the wallet.dat that you have, even if you don't know it.
Until you fully resync with the blockchain and rescan using your wallet.dat, it simply won't know which addresses have been used or what your real balance is.
If you really want to skip the 3-day wait to download the blockchain you can use the console to verify which keys your wallet.dat is holding.  Using blockchain.info, locate the transfer you made that resulted in change going to a hidden address, then open the Bitcoin-QT app, go to the debug window, and use 'walletpassphrase' to unlock the wallet for a few minutes, then 'getaccount' to expose the private key.  If it comes back with an answer then you have the info needed to spend your coin.
So if you have *any* readable copies of your wallet.dat, you should be ok.

Rather than make the general population out as sheep, my tendency is to describe it as a deeply ingrained pragmatism.  In order to effect change you either have to appeal to the community as a whole (which is politics), or else the impetus needs to pierce the shield of pragmatism.  
In this case the bitcoin community already values liberty.   The population as a whole values liberty in so far as their political leaders describe it as a good thing, and not otherwise.   As the two cultures mix either there will be pragmatic reasons to continue with the same set of values, or they will fall by the way side (as happened with the Internet in the late 90s).  But as long as a technological means remains of circumventing any new control points, I think you can rely on the general populace not to wander so far from the original values of Bitcoin that it actually causes any immediate and obvious consequences.

The whole reason those who have been through this before give advice not to put in more money than you can afford to lose is precisely because of this behavior.  
Of course anyone who has invested more than they can comfortably put at risk should withdraw while their losses are still tolerable, but the process of buying low and selling high has to involve points where the market seems to be tanking and you add to your risk, and points where the market seems to be soaring and despite that you decide to sell.
It is in the nature of supply and demand that you don't get low prices when everyone is exuberant, nor high prices when everyone is in the doldrums.   Not investing too much is the key to having the right attitude.

From a technical perspective it might not be possible to ban bitcoin, but from a political perspective it is as easy as writing the legislation.  I think the worries are well justified.

"Do you remember the good old days when you could buy a decent stake in Bitcoin for $400?  I'm think about buying in now, but it seems so overpriced at $1000 for a mBTC, I'm just not sure that it can go up from here."
Does that help with the decision?   Sorry, fiction aside, Bitcoin is an experiment, and looking backward it is always easy to say "I knew I should have bought then," or "I knew I should have sold then."  
My advice is don't put your life savings into Bitcoin, and don't regret putting in only as much as you were comfortable investing at the time.   There is no crystal ball into the future, and worrying because you have invested too much or too little isn't worth it.

GBL was an exchange, the others are online wallet services.   
Trusting your money to an online wallet is like giving money to a complete stranger and saying, here, hold this for me.  Even if the person is honest the concentration of deposits creates strong incentives for thieves to come along and take anything they can.
The common advice is to move bitcoins offline if you aren't using them, either into paper wallets or into a wallet hosted on an unnetworked computer.
GBL was an exchange in mainland China that was supposedly suspect even before they disappeared, but that would have been discussed on the Chinese boards, not here.
The thing is, Bitcoin attracts a lot of cons.  It puts more emphasis than ever back into the old phrase: A fool and his money are soon parted.

I think he was making a joke; in the aftermath of the Tulip bubble investors were left holding a Tulip.  If Bitcoin were to prove itself flawed beyond redemption you would be left with bits of data, i.e. nothing.
This of course neglects the value of the Bitcoin network, the businesses and people who place faith in Bitcoin as currency, and who use it to conduct business that cannot easily be conducted without Bitcoin, or that they do not wish to conduct without Bitcoin.  But it is a humorous comparison none the less.

There simply isn't any way to do this.   Mining difficulty is growing exponentially as new miners come on line.   As a result, Bitcoin rewards will decline and the best you can hope for is an income in fiat that is dependent on your mining rig.  And even that is only possible if the value of Bitcoin is growing at the same pace as the growth in difficulty.
When looking into mining equipment you can assume that anything that doesn't pay off 90% of its value in three months at the time of delivery is a losing proposition compared with investing in Bitcoin itself.   If the time of delivery is in the future then you should assume that the time required for it to pay off will be 10x as long as it would be right now for every three months it is in the future.  And these are optimistic estimates.

As an investment strategy buy low, sell high is easier said than done.   My advice wasn't quite so trite.  If you spend 0.1BTC of bitcoin on a sandwich, then replenish that 0.1BTC from your bank account the next time you have a chance.  Or if you are in the middle of a runup like the one going on now, add some BTC before spending it.  
You may end up with a small amount of really expensive BTC in your account, but averaged over your entire holdings 0.1BTC won't stand out enough to damage your overall investment point, and you won't run down your stake in a way that makes it much more expensive to replenish than the sandwich was worth in the event that BTC continues moving upward at its current pace.

Two points.  If the price of bitcoin increases then you will be better off having your investment in bitcoin than in mining equipment.   When comparing the two you can only look at the return in constant bitcoins; comparing in constant dollars assumes you would be out of the market altogether.
Second, I didn't bring up BFL because I thought you were investing in them per se, but because you are putting yourself in a similar position to the one I was in on April 2nd.  New company, no deliveries yet, lots of very attractive promises, and even if they follow through on those promises, it is very easy to underestimate the effect that yet earlier purchasers of KnC equipment will have on the ecosystem.

It really depends on what happens during the intervening weeks.  If there isn't a huge runup (and I don't think there will be for a variety of reasons), then people may be loathe to sell at a loss and the inflection might be a (for bitcoin) fairly mild drop as the market slows.  
If there is a big runup beforehand then people will likely be less comfortable with the price at the time of the inflection and the drop would likely be sharp.
All IMHO of course.

Otherwise the policy in China is that RMB is the only currency that can be used for commercial use inside the country.

I wouldn't put it in the form of a promise.  I think that a world economy in which bitcoin plays a significant role would be much less prone to terrorism.  
In part that is because it opens up markets that are currently closed.  Producers of goods and services that are not themselves embargoed, but which are run by individuals who live in embargoed countries are effectively given the opportunity to compete on the world stage, to earn money, and to hire employees.   Those employees instead of being bitter because their borders are closed and their pockets are empty are happier because they are being productive, and they can earn enough to live on.

The bitcoin technology will have to mature before it can reliably address those concerns, and this is true across the spectrum for in person sales.
People haven't gotten used to the tools, the number of bitcoin sales that happen in a week so tiny so they end up forgetting what they are supposed to look for, and what rules they should apply.  The cell phone that they use to take bitcoin transactions ran out of charge and no one remembered to plug it back in.

It might make more sense if MtGox is hanging on to the cash it has on hand to get itself out of the crisis.  Transferring USD to another exchange, buying bitcoin, and selling again on MtGox would give MtGox a greater share of ownership of the cash on deposit, but would decrease the actual cash available.
Since they have the cash in hand anyway there is very little reason for MtGox to try arbitrage on their own exchange.

BFL reports that their production line is conservatively producing about 400 units per day.  If correct then that implies that early April orders will arrive in about 5-7 weeks depending on what the average number of units is per order.  An order placed today would take a minimum of an additional 15 weeks based on an April to June delta of 17k orders.  
The network capacity is currently growing by an average 20TH per week.  For an order placed today, using the optimistic estimate that the order will arrive in 20 weeks, and if the current growth rate remains constant, the payoff time for the equipment will be 11 weeks (flat adjustment), versus 6 week payoff (flat adjustment) for an early April order.  All of this assumes that bitcoin retains a value of about $105 ea.  
The total network capacity at the end of 31 weeks would be an estimated 770TH leading to a $20 profit in the next week after payoff on a $274 investment, dipping to about $12.50/wk over the next six months.

Reddit is a little too emotional and TL;DR to have this kind of discussion.
That said, it is difficult to imagine a digital currency that doesn't fit the definition as given of Seigniorage.  Anything that moves over the internet and is of intrinsic value can also be duplicated indefinitely so has no duplication cost.  Anything that is backed by something physical with intrinsic value requires shipment of the resource to settle debt, so it isn't really a currency, just a debt tracking system.
In the case of Bitcoin and related technologies, if the Seigniorage aspect becomes onerous it is trivial to create a rival currency to replace it.   Indeed, I expect that any third world country would do so in lieu of using Bitcoin directly.  The neat aspect of Bitcoin and its ilk is that given a set of digital currencies the ability to establish an exchange to convert between them is almost trivial.  My digital download supporting currency can then compete with your digital fair trade coffee currency where it matters most, in terms of real utility.

Supply and demand is the mechanism for determining the price.  The value itself is embedded in the faith of the community that the supply and demand will have gradual upward price pressure over time.
That faith is founded on the structure of the market place as specified by the rules that are embedded in the Bitcoin application code, the historical performance of the marketplace, and the anticipated and actual utility of Bitcoin for payments through currently available goods and services and through investments in new goods and services.
Rapid price fluctuations such as the jump from $20 to $200 and back to $90 are a direct result of changes in demand relative to the available supply.   Since the price has remained fairly steady around $90 one must assume that the faith of the community supports that price, or that any individuals holding Bitcoins who do not have faith at that price have already sold their Bitcoin assets and are now out of the market.
It is also fairly clear that the faith of the community does not extend to a price of $200 per Bitcoin at this point.

For Bitcoin mining a fast Radeon card can mine around $0.80 to $2 a day on a shared pool (.01 - .02BTC) .  If your energy costs more than that you will be losing money, but for playing around with it is one way to get a small stake to move back and forth between accounts.
The current technology is ASIC based, with 150nm chips in common supply, and 65nm chips just being released.  Waiting time for 65nm parts is quite long at present, but the 150nm chips are fairly easily available on Bitmit, ebay, or Craigslist though the prices being asked for ready to deliver chips won't pay off very quickly.  Look for ASICMiner USB Eruptor offerings if you are interested in the 150nm.
The generation before is still capable of generating a profit as well assuming you don't pay too much for the equipment.  These are FPGA miners and the most available equipment that I've noted are the ZTex Quad FPGA boards.
I definitely wouldn't go into it with the idea that you will earn a mint mining.   No one can tell for sure where Bitcoin will be headed, so consider investments to be high risk and keep them within your means.  
That said, I think there is a lot to be learned from mining, and from the Bitcoin marketplace as a whole about alternative currency, its benefits and shortcomings.

Magnetic storage is in its own league for failure rates.  Paper is orders of magnitude more stable for data storage than a hard drive can offer.  If you are using magnetic storage and you want it to remain stable for decades then the only way to reliably do that is to keep the data online, managed, redundant, and maintained.  
Paper is by comparison much easier to retain reliably.  Acid free cotton rag paper should last at least a century without degrading or needing duplication in order to retain legibility, and vellum has a demonstrated life-span well in excess of a millennium.  Thus for paper storage you merely need to ensure that it isn't placed in an uncontrolled environment such as fire, flood, insect or animal damage.
Except that insects are a bit less likely to be attracted to a hard drive than to paper, pretty much the same environmental requirements apply to both types of media.

Just a word of friendly advice.  You sound upset.  Because you are upset you are making unreasonable demands, like insisting that I answer all of your questions about your Coinbase account.  
I don't have those answers.  Only Coinbase can tell you what exactly happened to your account, and if you are flooding their email with 'tones' of requests they might not see quite the same urgency you do.
I was explaining one simple aspect of Bitcoin that your post seemed to be overlooking.  I do not claim access to a general godlike power to explain everything about your experience.
If you are interested in figuring out what happened you will need to set aside your worries for now and open yourself to finding whatever you can.   Look back at any old records you have and see if your assumptions are correct.  What was the date and time that you received payment.  What time of day was it, and what was the reference source used for valuation (how did you know it was worth $50?)   What time did you spend the money?   What was the price on Bitstamp when you sent it?   
From that information you should be able to deduce what your account balance should be, and you can then give that information to Coinbase and ask them to explain the discrepancy.
I will tell you what I would probably be thinking if I were Coinbase.  "Huh?   A hundred new support requests?  Hey they are all from the same bloke, let's see what's going on.   Hey Charlie, look here.  Some dude is frantic because we lost 0.1603 bitcoins.   Think I should investigate?   Fuck that.  Just give him back his .1603 bitcoins.   If he keeps on yammering after that close his account."
"Close his account?  How can we do that?"
"We're a private company, we can do business with whoever we want to.  There is no bill of rights guarantee that everyone shall have the right to open a Coinbase account you know."
"Yeah, really."

The large buy order defines a wall below which it will be difficult to buy any bitcoins.  This doesn't raise the price in itself, but it does make it so that anyone who wants to buy some bitcoins has to place a higher bid than that.   It also means that any large sell orders that come in won't drop the price beyond that point unless they are larger still.
My guess is that someone is trying to buy a large number of coins but wasn't seeing enough market depth on the topside to buy at a point that he wanted.  So he is trying to tempt someone to offer a bunch of coins for sale at a point he is willing to pay.   
That said, if the coins are being sold quickly and it looks like the market wants to move down, the buyer will probably reprice at a lower point to let his cash go further.

The reported circumstances indicate that the transactions were not structured to avoid a greater than $10k deposit, but to conform with the expectations of their insurance agency's limits, which happen to have a $10k reimbursement limit.   Assuming that the law as written speaks to the intent of the business then their activity was presumably legal, and in any case there is no indication that the government is pressing forward with a criminal case, just that they have seized assets on suspicion of illegal activity.
If the government does open a criminal trial then I trust that a jury will rule on the actual legality or lack thereof of whatever this company did, but absent that I'd like to believe that it is still possible to enjoy the liberty of conducting business for cash, even when the business is selling groceries, and even when the proceeds of a week's business are well in excess of $10k.

Difficulty is adjusted on a periodic basis such that the previous couple of thousand blocks to be completed would have taken ten minutes on average if the difficulty had been in effect at that time.  In theory difficulty can either increase or decrease depending on whether hashing power is increasing on the network, or is decreasing.  But in practice difficulty almost always increases.  Take a look at a history graph of difficulty and you will see that the algorithm isn't fixed but adaptive based on recent history.

There isn't a canonical answer to that question, but a lot has been written about data security and almost all of that research is applicable to Bitcoin.
Grady Ward wrote a pretty good article on Passphrases, and the bibliography at the end is well worth reading as well:
I would caution though that any passphrase that you only use very rarely will be subject to memory lapses even with the techniques described in the article above.
This article on Coindesk describes brain wallets and how they can be used to avoid keeping a written copy of a key.
  
The next article on paper wallets allows you to keep keys on printed media, which reduces the opportunity to conduct computer based attacks on your wallet:
There have been a number of academic papers on erasure coding as a way of improving data longevity.  The same techniques can also improve data security.  The idea is to break the wallet up into several pieces, each one insufficient to reconstruct the original wallet without help from the other pieces, but able to reconstruct the wallet with some number of pieces missing:
For a N of M erasure code one would then need a method of securely storing M erasure coded data blocks such that at least N would eventually be possible to retrieve.
An implementation of erasure coding which may or may not have the security aspects you need, for Python can be found at the following link:
Using a cryptographic package to encrypt the wallet before it is erasure coded would eliminate the possibility of retrieving a subset of the wallet keys from a single redundant block regardless of the erasure coding algorithm:

Varying the price of goods in bitcoin to match the local currency doesn't bother me at all.  If you are sensitive to the price you can watch the charts and buy when bitcoin is up.

There are a number of possible answers to that question.  First, the seller may not be selling much in the way of bitcoins right now.  Alternatively his buyers may not have bank accounts, or may prefer to conduct business in cash in order to preserve their own anonymity.    Or the buyer's banks may be causing difficulties with international wire transfers.   Or they may not feel comfortable sending large quantities of money out of the US.   Or they may only be interested in buying small amounts of bitcoin and the cost of an international transfer might outweigh any savings on the bitcoins they are purchasing.   Or the seller may have cash tied up at MtGox and be unwilling to take a loss on the sale.
It isn't a scam, it is the effect that an illiquid market has on pricing.  A small number of sellers doesn't offer the same pricing opportunities as a larger market.  Without the same price pressure pricing won't stay as low.

If you study statistics you will encounter the concept of stochastically independent events.  
As human beings we want to find links between things.  If I flip a quarter ten times and so far it has come up tails 8 times out of ten, then it feels as though the next time is more likely to be heads.
The problem with being human is that we find links where there aren't any.  The next coin flip has a 50% chance of being heads, and a 50% chance of being tails.
To relate this to your own case, having lost $450k doesn't give you any special advantage over anyone else when making your next investment decision.  If anything it probably means that you have a tendency to misread the market and therefor are at a statistical disadvantage compared with everyone else.   
Your job then is not to make back $450k before your sister turns 21, but to invest $280k as wisely as you are able to until your sister turns 21.   Sure it sucks to go to your sister and say mea culpa, I tried to make our savings more valuable but blew it and lost a lot.  But it won't make her happier to have $0 in four years time.  Even $200k is a nice nest egg to start with, and provides a safety net to fall back on when both of you are so young.
When your living expense outpace your income it is time to reduce your expenses, or to increase your income, or both.   But if $2800 isn't enough of a risk, then what is the amount that you are willing to lose and say, oh well, that didn't work out?   If you go over that limit then that is what gambling addiction is; the inability to find and set limits on your financial exposure.

Susceptibility to fraud isn't solely a feature of Bitcoin.  You can be defrauded in Bitcoin, Dollars, Gold, by credit cards, and by check. 
But if you value being able to take responsibility for your own actions instead of having the government try to protect you from anything you could possibly do that might mess up your own life then Bitcoin offers a return to the "a fool and his money are soon parted" way of doing business.
As a buyer that means that you need to do more research before you give your money to someone else to avoid being defrauded.  As a seller it means that the 2% overhead caused by credit card fraud reduction disappears, along with the chargebacks that result from individual cases of fraud.
But it also means that you can participate in markets that Uncle Sam has decided for whatever reason that you don't need to.   It also means that you can buy or sell something, let's say men's size 30 frilly pink stockings, without having your identity sold to every marketer in the US.
Privacy.  Responsibility.  Liberty.  Civil disobedience.

Every currency in the world is dependent upon the faith and good will of the people who accept and spend that currency.   This is even true of gold for which, although it has intrinsic value, it isn't typically on the basis of that intrinsic value that you accept it in trade, but on the expectation of being able to trade it in the future to someone else for a thing that you need.
The only alternative is direct barter.   But that doesn't work so well when you need access to any of the myriad complex systems that our society produces.   Even if I have some very useful chickens, and even if someone working at a generator plant for PG&amp;E eats chicken, it just isn't feasible for me to exchange my chickens for his electricity without first converting to currency.

It is Sunday night.  I'd wait until at least Monday afternoon before getting too flustered.   
For first time buyers, Coinbase doesn't actually credit the coins to your account until your electronic funds transfer is complete, so before that you can't actually withdraw, your coins are in limbo awaiting the transfer.
If you just got a notification that the coins have been added to your account then perhaps the pending transfer that you had set up on Friday has started being processed.  I haven't actually ever tried to transfer coins out before they've been credited to me, so I'm not sure what the standard behavior is when doing so.

I think that the stratification of wealth is pretty much built in to Bitcoin without the need for war to enforce it.  You can't make me spend my Bitcoins; and you can't take them and give them to the poor without my assistance.
But I think you have a strong point that any Bitcoin economy that exists must by necessity be an economy of association through desire not an economy that is captive to law (nor war and violence).   So if the economic value derived from accepting Bitcoin becomes too constrained by the stratification then people will simply stop accepting Bitcoin and move to a different currency instead.

No, with deflation a gain of 0.1% relative to the basis of currency would be great for a zero-risk investment, but since the currency itself is deflating, the actual rate has to exceed 0.1% plus the rate of deflation, plus overcome any risk factor involved in converting your currency into a concrete investment.  
By contrast in the inflationary currency any investment that gets your currency out of cash and into investment assets is usually worthwhile since the cash will be losing value while any investment that isn't failing will at least keep a constant value negating inflation.
For example, consider the miners who invested bitcoin in Butterfly Labs mining equipment last year.  During that time the value of the mining equipment on the open market has grown by a factor of about 4:1 (a BFL 5GH miner on ebay will easily sell for $1100+), for a 400% return on investment.  Yet in the same time Bitcoin itself has grown by a factor of 10:1, for a net loss to every miner who invested in mining equipment any money that they otherwise might have had available to invest in Bitcoin.
Now consider how miners would feel if Bitcoin were inherently inflationary.  If Bitcoin had lost 20% of its value over the last year and would reliably continue to do so year after year, it would make sense to convert Bitcoin to almost anything else, and a 400% return on investment would look very attractive.

Hmmm... an excess of coins are sitting in cold storage? 
Every Bitcoin worth of value in the system belongs to someone, there are no bitcoins in cold storage that we could put into the market without first taking them from someone who owns them and doesn't think it is worth selling them at the current price.
That said, I do think that the current prices are encouraging people who have had long held balances to begin investing them.  The price is currently dropping, and while some of that may be due to reduced demand over the MtGox troubles, I think at least an equal part of the movement comes from investments that people are making in new Bitcoin ventures.  A lot of cash has been withdrawn for the ASIC manufacturing lines, but the conference last month in San Jose also demonstrated that there is a vast array of green field venture work in progress and most new ventures carry heavy legal burdens, and least some of which is probably being funded from investors holding Bitcoin.
It will take a couple of years for those investments to pay off so for the time being prices will drop as more coins flow into the market in exchange for cash.

It is a speculation bubble with a very long feedback loop.  Ultimately what will happen is that devices will become unprofitable to continue operating and people will have to take a loss on any unrecouped investment, or continue mining despite the economic futility.
At that point presumably enough people will drop out to make mining only marginally unprofitable, as opposed to the current state which is a near total loss.

Honestly, you would stand a better chance of making money by putting your cash into Bitcoins and waiting a year in the hope that they increase in value than by getting into mining right now.
Bitcoin makes a risky investment in itself.  Bitcoin mining makes a risky investment on top of a risky economy.  
There are a limited number of Bitcoins available each year to all comers.  Your investment in mining equipment is more akin to buying a set number of lottery tickets, good every ten minutes or so for the next year.  Each lottery pays out 25BTC.   Right now there is such an incredible influx of new mining equipment coming on line that there is no level of investment that should be considered to provide a guaranteed return.

It is unlikely that bitcoin-qt overwrote an existing wallet.dat file.  The more likely problem is that you haven't yet synched with the blockchain so bitcoin-qt has no way of telling what you what your current balance is.   Since you are still downloading blocks from 2010, your balance (as of 2010) is still zero.
If you remember which addresses from your wallet had bitcoin balances you can use the debug window to unlock your wallet and extract private keys for those addresses if you want to be sure that you can still access them.  Otherwise wait for the blockchain to sync.   If you can't remember which addresses were in use there are some python tools for extracting all of the public/private keypairs from a bitcoin-qt wallet, or you could use something like blockchain.info to trace out transactions from an address you know had bitcoins at one point in time to whichever change-making address they ended up in.

Coinbase accounts don't maintain any cash balance.  Any balance you see there is indexed in bitcoins, not USD.   Given the variability in bitcoin valuation, you may very well have received $50 in bitcoin, have spent $40, and have been left overdrawn as a result.

I placed an order with Butterfly in early March about two weeks before they shipped their first units and got an order number somewhere around 30000; just placed another order last week and the new order was around 60000, so I'm thinking that there will be a minimum of 300TH added to the network capacity over the next couple of months.
If growth stalled there the payoff duration for some Bitcoin Erupter equipment I was considering would have run about 14 months to Butterfly's 2 months.
The problem with Butterfly is that they've leapfrogged the technology curve and have managed to get some 65nm chips that actually kind-of work.  Net result is they can underprice and outperform anything else on the market until everyone else catches up.
Obviously this is just my own opinion and we'll have to wait and see how it all really plays out, but this is the way that I figure it, and I put my money where my mouth is.

Fun fact.  In the event of a prolonged and serious disagreement over the future of the protocol, the most likely outcome would be a blockchain fork in which both sets of rules are carried forward to be used by distinct communities.
If this happens then any bitcoins that exist before the fork will most likely be valid and spendable in either prong, while bitcoins created or acquired after the fork will only be spendable in their own prong.  To some degree this may represent a long term benefit of getting in early, although the ramifications of a prolonged fork would be difficult to predict.

I suspect that having a credit card on file mostly means that the credit card company trusts you to pay your bills.

A week is the time that it takes for the automated clearing house (ACH) to complete an electronic funds transfer from your bank to Coinbase.  
Coinbase's profit model is to charge you 1% against the loan of money on deposit at an exchange, to be paid off in one week when the ACH transfer completes.   If they trust you they will give you the bitcoin immediately, but absent that trust you will have to wait for the transfer.
To automatically give you the bitcoin before they trust you would require charging an overhead for fraud, which isn't part of their current profit model.  Such an approach would require at least an 8% margin, but probably more to handle the risk involved.

In addition most wallets have ways of exporting the private keys in a form that can be imported into another wallet.  Using this feature you would be able to spend bitcoin from either wallet.

Yeah, assuming that you provided the wallet passphrase, if needed, that error indicates that you don't have that key.  (If your wallet is encrypted and not unlocked then that error will be returned regardless.)
I haven't known bitcoin-qt to delete wallets peremptorily, but it does rewrite the file if it can't find it, and there may be other circumstances which would have the same effect.   If you have any other copies of your wallet.dat you can test them using the same command.  Otherwise, there is no way to rediscover an old set of keys other than by retrieving them from some sort of storage, be that brain wallet passphrase, wallet generation key, a backup copy of wallet.dat, stringified private key, or QR-code.

Thanks for the correction.
Mining equipment typically currently costs between $10/GH and $50/GH depending on the manufacturer, the delay in delivery time, and the technology.  At the upper end of the cost scale $50/GH will deliver about 1GH of hashing power for 10W of electricity.   At the bottom end the rate is about 2-3W of electricity per 1GH, but the equipment is less available, either because it has yet to be manufactured, or because it is in high demand and has a long waiting list.
The current difficulty is 8000TH/s, translating to about 800MW for the current network at the 65-150nm technology level.

Every number in the world exists, but that doesn't mean it is in the network.   Private keys and public keys are just very large numbers that have a mathematical relationship to one another.   The relationship is one that makes it easy to calculate the public key from the private key, but impossible to do the reverse without checking every possible value.
When you make a payment to a public key you are letting the network know that if someone has the private key associated with that public key they can spend that transaction.  The network doesn't know the private keys, so it can't spend the transaction itself, only with help from a user who has those keys can it ever be spent.

Disclaimer; I am not an economist.
For a deflationary currency which has its value founded in the faith of its users, I believe that there will be a fundamental disconnect between stored value as represented by savings in user accounts and the capacity of the economy it represents to preserve actual value.   Long term that will lead to inequities in earning and savings potential between generations that will prevent your children of late bitcoin-adopters from ever being able to develop a significant stake in the economy in comparison with the children of the early bitcoin-adopters regardless of their actual contributions to society and economy.
Historically this kind of economy led to feudal structures.  In ancient Rome the Senators had enough cash to buy the entire gross product of the empire at the rates the general populace paid, and the Emperor could have done so all by himself, leading the a highly stratified society and serious conflicts between the Emperor, the Senatorial class, the Equestrian class, the Legions and the citizens.  For that reason I doubt that it can actually survive over the long term.   Late non-participants will end up having to build a non-bitcoin economy in order to preserve a reasonable stake in their own future.
Without any mechanism for rebalancing wealth to promote growth and creativity a society is very likely to stagnate (if the society is generally benevolent and their are no external pressures), or experience upheaval (otherwise).
That said, Bitcoin is certainly very attractive right now.  With the economy expanding exponentially leading to exponential growth in value it is very difficult not to want to be in Bitcoin right now.  And even once the economic growth rate begins to tail off, the natural tendency to compress value into fewer Bitcoins will continue as people tend to save coins thus leaving only a relatively small number of coins to represent the entire active economy of Bitcoin.

But that is only a slightly more succinct way of stating what I wrote earlier:  "On the contrary, companies like Bitpay represent a large part of the core value of Bitcoin..."  
If it didn't convince you before, I don't see why it would convince you now, and I didn't see the need to repeat that argument when I wrote: "Then you've missed why bitcoin has value."

This would be easier and less expensive to accomplish at a tiny little exchange.  At VirWox, for example, you could run the market dry of BTC for under $40,000, at which point your price would be the selling price of BTC at that exchange until people were able to move more BTC onto the exchange (about an hour), or if they already have bitcoin there, until they notice that their standing orders have all been fulfilled.  
The smaller the exchange, the easier it is to manipulate.
You could argue that even the largest exchanges in bitcoin-land are tiny in comparison with the NYSE.   The result is high volatility as the bigger fish move in and out of the market.

Most businesses that accept bitcoin price and bill in local currency, and then convert to bitcoin at a rate dependent upon where they exchange their bitcoin.  For an ongoing subscription you might want to identify which market your prices are set against for the comfort of your subscribers.
Given that you already accept credit cards, you may find that anyone coming to you with bitcoin payments is doing so for the specific features that bitcoin offers, which in this case may be that there is a hard stop to any payments absent an affirmative step by the buyer to continue.  Or it might be something else -- micropayments for example, or international subscriptions, or some other thing that bitcoin does differently or more cleanly than the standard financial system.
Rather than try to recreate the credit card environment for your bitcoin purchasers, perhaps it would be better to think about those differences and see what unique value it could provide both to your business and to buyers coming from the bitcoin community.

Using Armory in offline mode is very secure as well, and could be a bit easier to use if you often need to pull bitcoin from secure storage, but requires that you dedicate a laptop to the offline transaction signing.
Bitcoin-QT will take a couple of days to synch up before you can use it effectively.  The same database is used by bitcoind, which in turn is used by Armory for its network facing support.

I think that upward pressure will continue for at least a year.  The end of the Silk Road may decrease utility in the near term which could decrease some of the upward pressure, but growth in Asia seems to be overriding those concerns for the time being.
Once the Silk Road lawsuits have drawn to a close government controlled bitcoins seized in the raid will probably be liquidated, which will eventually create a possibly large downward pressure depending on how many coins are ultimately seized and how quickly they are liquidated.
Difficulties at MtGox are continuing to leave a margin between trading at that exchange and other bitcoin exchanges.   Regulatory hurdles to be overcome before MtGox can freely distribute funds to US citizens, followed by likely problems obtaining bank accounts will continue to limit the role of MtGox in setting a realistic trading price for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin mining equipment is over committed in the market, which will likely lead to some downward pressure as the mining companies with reserves in bitcoin liquidate them to fund ongoing operations in hopes of surviving this next competitive stretch.
Many bitcoin startups are in the early stages; as these companies mature utility should swing upward, increasing demand.

In the near term Bitcoin is too volatile to be used to index prices.  When it evens out, where ever it evens out, it might be usable until the next big event, but that could be a very short time if a surprise comes along.
What most sites do, and what makes the most sense in my opinion is to price goods in local currency, and accept bitcoin at some amount near market price for those goods, listing the converted bitcoin cost next to your local currency cost.
What you do next depends on your business strategy and how tolerant it is of swinging valuations.   If you need most or all of the purchase price back to renew stock then convert it immediately and send the bitcoins back for a new purchase/sale cycle.   
If you have more leeway then it can make sense to keep part of the purchase in bitcoin to help invest in the market that is powering your business, and to benefit from the long term prospects that we hope it has, and which you as a member of the community deserve a part of if you want and can tolerate it.

The primary risk you are running by leaving bitcoin on deposit at Coinbase is that the government will step in and seize their assets on some technical legal violation that no one knew about a month before it happens.   Since bitcoin legal compliance is rapidly evolving this is more worrisome to me than any other specific factor.
I suggest moving your bitcoin except for spending money to paper wallets, which are fairly easy to secure.  If you will need to move bitcoin very frequently (like daily) between savings and active wallets then it might be more useful to set up an offline wallet like Armory, but for rare transfers that is more trouble than it is worth in my opinion.
Experiment with a small amount first to verify that you know how to use a paper wallet correctly.

50btc is a ghost town.  Looks like it is running, but the place is dead.   If you stick around long enough they might eventually solve a block and be able to pay you something, but I wouldn't hold out much hope that it will happen soon.
Of course, even if they do have something to pay you with you will have to wait for them to solve their database problems before they will be able to do payouts.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:40:14
What they wrote previously was that on earlier occasions where 50btc was hacked and had 1140BTC stolen from their accounts, the loss was absorbed by 50btc and not passed on to their users.
I suppose it was meant to reassure everyone and keep them all mining.  If you take a look at their hashing power graph you will see that it has tailed off rapidly despite those assurances, so that was pretty much a lost cause.
In any case, I wouldn't hold my breath.  When they wrote that they lost their user balances, they mean that they don't have any idea what any user on the site is actually owed.  Whatever balance you think you have is pretty meaningless since the whole database is corrupted beyond repair.

Think about it this way.  The people who are driving the price up to $600 are the ones who decided a couple of weeks before you did to invest in bitcoin, and they are only having impact now.  
By going to LocalBitcoin you can jump the line (for a convenience fee), which may or may not actually be a good thing.
If you do decide to wait you'll be coming in with everyone else who got excited by what ever news interested you in Bitcoin.  Maybe that will have worn thin in the interim, or maybe the current price drop will be just what they were hoping for.  Who knows?
The point though is that even if the law allowed anyone and everyone to buy in within a few minutes, the net effect would just be even more instability in the valuation.  This way at least you have the chance to rethink your strategy and maybe decide it isn't such a good idea.   Or maybe it is, who knows?

Coinbase, like MtGox, appears to sweep deposits into a collected deposits account, and the pay out bitcoin from whichever company account has funds sufficient to cover the transaction.  So I believe you are right about Coinbase.
It is possible to use JavaScript code to generate both public/private keypairs and use those keys to sign transactions.  That means that the web site does not need to have access to your keys in order to give you what appears to be an online wallet, but can instead store just an encrypted copy of the keys that can only be unlocked using your password.   
Blockchain.info reputedly uses this approach.   An attacker could still appropriate your keys though by pretending to be Blockchain.info well enough to get you to enter your password.
When generating accounts on you own computer you have both the halves of the keypair, and must protect the private keys yourself.   Common ways to do so are by storing them in paper wallets, offline wallets, or by encrypting your wallet.dat.

Any full exchange will let you buy instantly, but you have to have money on deposit to cover the purchases.  Bitstamp is the obvious exchange to use, but BTC-e has lower prices if you don't worry about keeping money on deposit in a Russian bank.  If you prefer a US exchange the only currently active exchange in the US is CampBX, but my feeling is that it is a bit of a shoestring operation.  YMMV.

Ah, you are wondering what the lifespan of the Bitcoin market is?   That kind of depends on what barriers exist to competition, doesn't it.   
Right now Bitcoin can compete assymetrically with national markets by depending upon a couple of advantages.  The first is that as an open settlement protocol it can attract new types of payment businesses that have not existed before, subject only to the abilities of those companies to remain legal within their jurisdictions.   Micropayment services for content delivery, mail filtering, content development support, and collaborative development are possibilities that spring to mind, but there are a world of possibilities I can't begin to imagine.
The second is that as Bitcoin units consist entirely of data, the market is free to extend into regions which are otherwise not served by current financial services either due to foreign monetary policy, or because the risk of operating in that environment is too high, or the value represented by the market is too small.  This includes businesses such as gambling, businesses that happen to be located in countries behind monetary barriers, but whose goods are not themselves embargoed, and businesses that experience high rates of fraud, among others.

Maybe they do, but it is hardly any more effort to buy bitcoin than it is to pay your credit card bill.  The question was why would you tolerate the loss of bitcoin, and the answer IMHO, is because you have them and you want to buy something and you know how to replenish your supply.
Cash costs me about 1-2% depending on how much money I pull from my ATM at a time and the specific ATM fees involved, plus 2% per year in inflation less 1.22% in interest except for the cash that I keep in checking which draws 0.2% interest.
Credit cards cost me about 4% in hidden costs associated with the 90 day settlement time and about 2.5% in fees, although those costs are spread over both cash and Credit Card customers due to the way that credit card companies negotiate their contracts.
Bitcoin balances on average over the last three years have paid a very nice return, although there is no guarantee that they will continue to do so in the future, nor even a guarantee that I will be able to use them for any specific payment.
Ultimately I keep a balance of bitcoin to cash that makes sense in my situation, not so much that I'm forever worried about the market, and not so little that I feel underinvested.

I meant favorable to the Bitcoin community.  If someone got a government office to send an official cease and desist to anyone it was because a political adversary took an interest in making that happen.  If you still want to be able to use your Bitcoins legally in California within five years you will want to establish case law that supports that legality.  It is meaningless to argue here that this should be a question of personal liberty when it is the courts that decide what is criminal behavior and what is freedom.  
I homeschool my kids.  Personal liberty, right?  Not without litigation it isn't.  The teacher's unions bend the ears of the institutions they support arguing that homeschooling does a disservice to the children; legislators believe them and try to pass laws banning or restricting homeschooling; members of the executive branch believe them and press lawsuits under existing child welfare laws and mandatory school attendance laws.  So as a homeschooler it is in my own best interest to support the organizations that litigate to protect homeschoolers and thereby preserve my freedom to do what I think is best for my kids.

Admittedly my potential losses are also limited, but I know that accepting delivery of my current order will result in a loss, and I'm not willing to triple down for a potentially much larger loss, so my options all suck.  You at least have the option of converting to a potentially profitable new platform without throwing good money after bad.

The problem is that Coinbase doesn't really sell Bitcoin.  What they sell is a one week loan so that you can buy Bitcoin today for cash that won't arrive at an exchange until a week from today.  
But when Coinbase runs out of cash, they can't really guarantee you any particular price any longer, instead they have to wait for more cash to arrive at an exchange or for someone to sell some Bitcoin so that they have cash in position to buy for you.
Right now Coinbase has run through all of the cash they have on hand for today.  They will happily take your cash and issue a buy order for you after it arrives at an exchange, but they have no way of predicting what the price will be at that time.   Thus the checkbox.

Q7. For anyone in the USA who wants to acquire Bitcoin to complete a Bitcoin enabled transaction, making ATMs available would decrease the time required to obtain Bitcoin and thus increase the opportunity for conducting that business.

It is already hard for a person to acquire 500 BTC even if they have 500 USD.  
What you don't seem to understand is that the value of bitcoin isn't controlled by anyone, it is a free and open market, and if someone wants to sell you 500 BTC for a dollar they damned well can.
The current supply and demand is what sets the price of Bitcoin.  If more people are willing to sell than buy then the price will drop with each trade until supply and demand are once again in equilibrium.
Trying to artificially control the price of Bitcoin would be pointless.  Either you would giving BTC away for less than people are willing to pay for it, or you would be giving money away for fewer BTC than people are willing to offer for it.  
No one in the world has the kind of money required to maintain a fixed relationship between two currencies because any difference between the stated value and the actual value provide opportunities for arbitrage, and that arbitrage will suck money out of whoever is trying to set the fixed price   as quickly as the money orders can be arranged and sent.

You are making the mistake of thinking that anything at all can happen.   Realistically there are a couple of factors that combine to give Bitcoin its value: systemic growth, and speculative growth.   Systemic growth comes from goods and services that are dependent on the Bitcoin ecosystem for their continued operation.  Bitpay, and Coinbase are good examples for the US, although there are hundreds of others around the world ranging from small businesses to large VC backed ventures.  
Speculative growth on the other hand is both cyclic and undependable.  It is valuable to the community because increased investment extends the business reach of bitcoin, but business growth can't expand instantly to fill the new niches that are opened so it is a see-saw, and you should expect downsides to each investment run-up.
As far as dropping to $.01/BTC, of course it is possible.  It would require really bad news.   If for example the result of the Senate hearings in the US had been emplace restrictions on Bitcoin such that it could not be traded without a $1M security bond in place, that would have effectively taken access out of the hands of the public, and would cause the failure of a number of bitcoin based businesses.  Another similarly bad piece of news would be if we discovered a problem in the protocol that made all current bitcoin transactions unverifiable the result would be to suddenly stop all Bitcoin commerce.
But those are black sheep events.  You also limit your investments so that you don't have to worry about black sheep events, but you don't otherwise change your strategy for them unless you think you can predict a specific event happening at a specific time.

Coinbase has to endure more attempted fraud than most businesses do.  If you could get away with a theft you would be holding cash equivalent value that is virtually anonymous, and you don't have to walk into a bank toting a firearm to get it.
So you tried to buy bitcoins with an invalid bank account number, and that does make you high risk.  And unfortunately the mass influx of new customers means that you won't be able to talk to anyone to sort the issue out until the business has expanded its support staff.  Right now, to the best of my knowledge, Coinbase still consists of two employees and a massive investment.  They know that customer service is lacking and are trying to set up a new support group, but haven't yet got it in place.  Until then it most likely will be frustrating, but an email to the support address might get an early response.
There are other alternatives as well.  You can buy or sell bitcoin through Localbitcoin by meeting an actual human being in exchange for cash.  Or you can start the account application process at Bitstamp to get verified and transfer money in for purchases that are more directly under your own control.

I don't have quite that much faith in bitcoin.  I denominate profit in USD, and keep the bulk of my savings there, so while I might not invest 20btc to create a car, I would invest the equivalent 20btc in USD to build a car as a hedge against poor performance of Bitcoin.
That said, if I am specifically making a Bitcoin investment, and it doesn't pay off in terms of Bitcoin, then it isn't worthwhile as far as I am concerned.  This is the case with Bitcoin mining equipment, which I have no interest in except in its ability to produce Bitcoin.   If the mining returns aren't up to the initial investment in Bitcoin then I see no reason to buy in.

Yes, Coinbase fixes your price at the point at which you request the purchase.  After that it takes about 7 days to complete the electronic funds transfer (4-6 business days), during which time your purchase is held in check.   
After being level 2 verified the bitcoin is credited immediately to your account and can be withdrawn as soon as it is purchased and Coinbase will wait for the EFT without holding any collateral.
Level 2 verification requires that you have a verifiable credit history and can answer questions from that credit history correctly.  The questions are similar to ones that you would see when getting your yearly free credit report.  I didn't find it particularly onerous, but others on Reddit have reported problems getting level 2 verified.

Putting your eggs all in one basket works well if you know what you are doing and don't make any mistakes.  Splitting things up gives you some time to learn from your first mistake before risking the rest of your coins.
As you noted with regard to the recent issue with Android wallets, someone who had all of their savings in a single wallet would have risked their entire wallet every time they sent a transaction.  Splitting their balance between multiple wallets would reduce the risk of a total loss even if all of the wallets were Android wallets.
Splitting up savings over multiple distinct technologies or implementations would vastly decrease the risk of a total loss, which is a well known effect of heterogeneous systems.
The risk of a partial loss may be increased by being unable to do a careful review of the security of each storage system leading to additional errors that you might otherwise have been able to predict, but that is generally less of a problem than that a single unexpected bug will leave you wide open.

You explain to your financial advisor that you want a small part of the investment to go into a speculative fund that has unlimited upside potential.  A good advisor will help you figure out what you need to set aside for your anticipated needs, and what you can afford to put at risk.  
It may be, especially in a rural area, that any advisor would consider bitcoin too far out to even consider.  But you don't need to worry about that, what they can help with is deciding how much you are willing to risk, and thus how much you can afford to bet on this promising but volatile technology.
My own recommendation would be to invest no more than 1%, do so up front or dollar cost averaged over a period of a couple of months, and sit on it for two years before deciding whether the investment is paying off.   The goal is to be at an investment point where you don't look back and say: I wish I had bought 10x as much bitcoin to start with if it goes up, and don't say I wish I had bought 1/10th as much if it goes down.

Q1. Who is they?  The Bitcoin community?  The question is almost nonsensical.  Bitcoin is traded like a commodity, but is only redeemable as itself, and is only backed by the faith of the community that uses it.  It has no credit, and no debt.  It has no profit or loss.  It has no revenue, nor any projected revenue, but is run on a volunteer basis by miners who are rewarded with a share of newly created bitcoins according to a fixed schedule that is encoded in the system.  Violating the schedule is impossible without creating invalid blocks, and thus bitcoins that cannot be exchanged.

If I were buying in now, I'd put in about half now against the chance of a sustained climb that doesn't peak until &gt;$1k, and half later against the chance of a correction that drops below the current price point, which I would then use to rebase my initial investment as soon as it looked to be bottoming out.

Every time you sell bitcoins to buy an investment (as opposed to for living expenses), you run a risk of missing an event like that of April this year.  After that event even if you sell your investment you won't be able to get back as many bitcoins as you would have had if you simply held on to them.   Over time events like that one level out though and you can point out that on the whole Bitcoin has some average rate of deflation.  
Let's say that the long term average rate of deflation is 10% per year (right now it would be more like 300%).  In that case if you could live on 1% of your savings your buying power would increase every year by 9% without investing in anything at all, and any investment you make that earns less than 9% interest would bring you less buying power at the end of the investment than just leaving your savings in bitcoin would have brought.

But if you wait one more month you will be offered an upgrade to the Luna Moth chip, which is in the process of tapeout, and will be delivered by November with a performance of 4PH drawing only 600W, for which you can convert your $2800 into a $2520 credit on the new mining platform, but you will have to make up the $2480 difference in cost out of pocket.

I'm not a technical investor, so my goal isn't to get a best price on bitcoin, but to get a fair price.  To do so the easiest way I know of is by cost averaging, that is by buying a set amount of bitcoin on a semi-frequent basis until I have as much as I'm interested in holding, and I typically do that when the graph has flattened out a bit.
I don't know where the prices will settle, although I'm guessing around $400-$600.  It may be difficult to catch them at their lows though.  There is clearly a lot of pent up desire to buy in under $600, given the hard bounce that Bitcoin took last week, so I doubt it will be that low for more than part of a day.

Not *what* if the money is finite?
Bitcoin clearly has an early adopter bias, and there is no built in mechanism for redistribution of accumulated wealth.  Is that what you mean?
Inflation effectively allows a society to tax all savings at a flat rate and use the additional cash for the social good, but there are other means that governments have at their disposal for redistributing wealth so I'm not sure that a criticism on that basis is entirely valid.

The article references Blockchain as a source for how much energy is used in mining, but Blockchain's estimate of 650W/GH is about a 100x overestimate.
Current 65nm to 150nm technology runs about 40W for 5-8GH (5-10W/GH) and the newer 22nm chips are 2-3W/GH.  This makes the whole article pretty pointless.

Best case is MtGox is having problems with their banks that they optimistically believe can be solved rapidly and you'll get your cash in a couple of weeks as the backlog continues to be serviced.
Worst case the MtGox problem continues stringing people along for the next six months while the exchange pricing becomes increasingly disconnected from the market.  In the meantime the MtGox money transmission applications are being processed through USGOV, then just after MtGox announces that their backlog will be completely cleared 'real soon' some set of states refuse them a license and they ditch the whole US market and announce that they will only be allowing withdrawals to European and Asian banks leaving US customers to withdraw via Bitcoin.
My bet is on the second.

Look at it on the bright side.  One of your fellow Paypal enthusiasts decided to complain to Paypal about Eobot thirty some odd days ago, and Paypal took immediate action to ensure that every other customer doing business with Eobot would get their money back.   The way they do this is by putting a hold on all payments.  This is fine because businesses expect payments to be held up for settlement for 180 days and have that built into their fee schedules.  No one else complains and life goes back to usual three months later.
Or someone else does complain, or they complete their investigation and find that Eobot is selling Bitcoin (evil), so shut them down, scammers that they are!  Bad Bitcoin.

Were you using a brain wallet?   If so then the most likely cause is that someone guessed your passphrase. 
Converting passphrases into a wallet is done using a publicly defined process that is standard across accounts, and does not require anyone to guess your account or that your account  is associated with a particular wallet, or is hosted on blockchain.info.  
Guessing passphrases can be done both remotely and across the entire history of addresses in the block chain in a simple generate and lookup sequence that allows massively parallel and high powered attempts at breaking any passphrase you might choose.
For this reason, you must not choose passphrases that are easily derived from song lyrics, poems, speeches, or popular quotations.
If you did choose a breakable passphrase you might try posting a note with your public wallet address here on reddit and see if any of the grey hat hackers here happened to be the one to break your encryption keys first in which case they will probably return your bitcoins to you.

How a wallet manages bitcoin balances depends on the implementation of the wallet, and is varied depending on the wallet software.
For example in Bitcoin-QT any payment at all will result in a split transaction where one part goes to the payee you designate, and the remainder will go into a hidden account managed by Bitcoin-QT for holding change.  This makes it difficult to use the blockchain to check the balance of your wallet since you may not know all of the accounts that are associated with your wallet, and looking at any one account will show you an incomplete picture.
So, depending on which wallet you are using you could have had your funds stolen, or else you could still have access to them.
I personally recommend moving bitcoin out of online wallets and into a wallet that you control, and then understanding what you need to do to protect your personal wallet from loss due to disk failure, loss of passwords, etc.   I only ever keep pocket change in online wallets, and if the sums are large enough I think it is worthwhile moving them into either paper wallets or into an offline manually processed walled instead.

Mt. Gox used to be quite accessible from the US, but didn't file the right paperwork to continue operating as a licensed money transmitter after the government decided that Bitcoin currency exchange was equivalent to money transmission.
Other competitors have often been scared away by the legal restrictions on operating in the USA, and some of those that have been willing to jump through the legal hoops have had difficulty getting access to the banking system since U.S. banks have pretty much universally decided not to expand their business with any bitcoin based businesses.
That leaves overseas banking and overseas exchanges as the main competitors for Coinbase, although Bitpay covers some overlapping areas, and there are other startups in the planning stages that are ready to come out if they can resolve the banking issues.

That is a long time to hold on to a bad position without trying to either rebase the investment, but people can be stupid sometimes, and he may not have been willing to invest more while the value was down.

Mining equipment is paid in advance, thus any sudden growth in BTC value would apply equally to a direct investment in coins without the added risk.

Carol now has GoxUSD.  
No matter how many sales there are the GoxUSD balance never decreases, but Bitcoin keeps moving off site, thus USD is plentiful while Bitcoin becomes sparse.  By simple supply and demand you should expect GoxUSD/BTC price to increase.

Yeah, people tend to underestimate the potential damage that can be caused by hoarded coins.   When savings in the network vastly exceeds the actual storage ability of the encompassing economy it becomes difficult to reconcile savings value  with redeemable goods in any useful way.

The algorithm that is being solved is designed to have a continuously adjustable difficulty so that the combined power of the world of bitcoin miners can find a solution on average once every 10 minutes even as the number and power of miners changes over time.
Other than that, the algorithm is designed to be difficult to cheat.  We believe that there is no faster way to solve the algorithm than by laboriously checking trillions of possible answers one at a time.  
Together these two characteristics are used to secure and serialize transactions in the blockchain, which is the primary reason for including the mining algorithm in Bitcoin.

I pulled 10% out of thin air, but taking a moment to consider the factors involved I'm not sure it is an unrealistic long term average.
Deflationary pressure would come from several sources but would include at least: Economic Growth, Personal Savings, and Lost Bitcoins.
In gross terms the US has averaged a real growth rate of 2.5% per year over the last 50 years after discounting inflation.   Over the same period of time the US personal savings rate has dropped from about 8% to about 4%.  Bitcoin is designed to encourage savings, but let's use the lower end of that scale at 4% for the deflationary pressure.  
That leaves about 3.5% for various forms of shrinkage in the Bitcoin supply which could reasonably include data storage failures, forgotten passwords, thefts not returned to the economy, unexpected deaths, errors (transfers to addresses that have no owner), and fire/flood damage.   Does 3.5% really seem excessive?

Bitcoin is risky by its nature.  Mining doubly so.  
But a one year profit of $364 (or $595 if you start counting from date of receipt instead of from date of payment) on an investment of $274 is stratospheric from an investment perspective.
So I respectfully disagree that the potential for gain is insubstantial.  
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:25:34
Yes, of course, but the limitation is primarily one of constraining the rate at which storage requirements increase.  Provided that we are all willing to accept the increased storage requirements, the block size can be made arbitrarily large.  
Running into the current limits on the number of transactions that can be processed per second will increase the pressure both to move transactions off of the blockchain, making the blockchain itself a resource for settling charges between markets rather than for individual payments, and to increase the block size.  
The point I was trying to make though is that credit transactions don't need to be on the block chain at all, and as they become more expensive to attach to the blockchain it will become increasingly easy for external payment systems to move bitcoin credit around off-blockchain and then settle those credits on demand.

Since blockchain doesn't have access to your bitcoins there is very little reason for them to intentionally close up shop.  Blockchain crypto is handled in JavaScript from within your browser, and in my opinion is the most secure of the online wallet services currently available.
That said, they could lose their encrypted copy of your wallet leaving you high and dry if you haven't made a backup.  
They could be taken down by a DDOS, but this would have a limited shelf-life; at best a day or two, although it might be particularly badly timed from your perspective.  
A third party could put up a site that looks like Blockchain and trick you into using it, complete all of your authentication for you, then spend your money without telling you.  And since you don't ever actually check to see if 'https' is enabled and that the certificates you've received are valid, the attack might not even be that difficult.  Just an email with a bad link might do the trick.
But those problems are true of any online wallet.  To be safe I'd recommend moving savings to an offline storage location.   Paper wallets are the easiest of these to use.
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:11:03
That isn't the only possible attack.  I was specifically thinking of the recent Feathercoin attack in which the alternate chain of computations weren't published to the network until a couple of hours after they began computing the split tree.
So the chance isn't required to be that you solve 10 blocks first in a row, but that you solve 10 blocks in the time than it takes the rest of the network to solve 9.

Just a hint for anyone who is looking at the Bitcoin prices now and thinking, "Ooh!  Cheap Bitcoins!  Let me transfer my savings account to _TradesiteX_ and turn it into Bitcoins!"
No one knows what the near future pricing will be for Bitcoin, it is too volatile and there are too many unknowns.   
Rule one is that you almost certainly should be splitting your investment up into several smaller parts.  If you invest $150 for your first bitcoin, and $100 for your second then your average basis is $125; not as good as it would be if you had perfect foresight, but not as bad as if you caught the market at a temporary high.   
Rule two is that you almost never want to invest while the market is dropping rapidly.  Markets drop more rapidly than they recover.  You will have a lot more time to invest wisely on the way back up than you have on the way down.
Rule three is never invest more than you can stand to lose, especially when the investment is risky.  All Bitcoin investments should be considered risky.

I think it is a matter of pricing to the market.  Demand is so high right now that miners available for immediate delivery are selling for more than they can reasonably be expected to generate in direct income.

But with the alternatives all experiencing multi-month delivery queues it is hard to see what alternatives are reasonably available for someone who wants to experiment with mining now.

As a rule of thumb, you never overwrite a 'wallet.dat' without first copying the old one off.  You cannot get it back later if you just overwrite it, and although you may not believe you need any of those addresses, it is almost always easier to just keep a copy.
That said, yes, you can backup your new wallet.dat (to 'wallet-I-don't-think-I-need-this.dat') then copy from your old hard drive over the wallet.dat on your new drive.

0.2486BTC -&gt; $50 translates to a valuation of $201.12  
During the lows on 10/24 and 10/25 bitcoin valuation dropped to about $161 on the Bitstamp exchange.  At $161:
0.2486BTC -&gt; $40.02
So if you caught the low when sending $40 you could have emptied your account assuming the initial conditions are correct.  If you want to know exactly what happened you'll need to contact Coinbase and ask them for the data.  
I should add that there is clearly some error in your initial conditions.  The entire day of 10/26 the valuation of Bitcoin never got to $201 on the Bitstamp exchange (Coinbase's primary market), so you can't have received $50 in the form of 0.2486BTC on that day using Coinbase as the arbiter of value.

To keep the hard fork going, you would also have to either have more hashing horsepower on the side of the change than on the side of the original rules, or you would also have to refuse to accept blocks that were valid on the original chain.  Otherwise your fork will disappear as soon as the primary chain difficulty exceeds yours.
Moreover, even if you had more hashing horsepower on your side, unless you could also convince a majority of the users to accept the change, any blocks on your chain would simply be rejected as invalid payments by clients still following the old rules.

I also hate loose money.  Always hanging on you showing off gilt curves, trying to ply you with whiskey.  I propose a ban on loose money; who is with me?
Seriously though, if you can't bear to lose any money then the right level of investment in Bitcoin for you is zero.   If you have some money to speculate with then split it up into several smaller parts and invest a bit at a time, say once a week, for a couple of months.
At that point you will have a stake in Bitcoin and it will either be worth more or less than the average that you have put in so far.  If it is worth more then you can cash out part and wait for a drop.  If it is worth less then you can invest more and thereby decrease your basis, making it easier to hit a profit point, but eventually you'll have to wait for the price to increase.
At no point should you invest more than you can afford to lose, and there are other fairly simple rules of thumb to use when investing in a volatile market, like avoid investing when there is a rising or falling knife edge.   It is very difficult to make a good investment decision when prices are changing very rapidly and you are less likely to catch a rapidly decreasing market at it minimum than you are to get a good price when it is recovering.   Similarly it can take weeks or months for a market to settle back to its minimum from a high bubble.   If you are investing now you should be prepared for the market to go either way so keep cash in reserve to invest at a lower point if it goes there.
In terms of fundamentals, the main risk right now is that new federal legislation could harm the US market, and a substantial risk that MtGox will have worsening problems further decreasing liquidity although other exchanges seem to be prepared to pick up the slack.  On the up side there is a lot of new investment in Bitcoin based businesses that has yet to be felt in the market; if these businesses are successful then utility will increase and prices should follow.

If you put a $2000 offer up on one of the exchanges it is unlikely that you will be buying from yourself, or even that you will be buying for $2000 since you would first have to buy up all of the offers that are less than $2000.   If you privately trade $2000 to yourself in exchange for a Bitcoin that won't be reflected in the price since the listed price is an exchange price, not a private transaction price.

2-3 Months is always a tricky point to predict, but if I were to put a post in the ground, I'd say that the current runup will peter out and the price will begin to collapse to its post-runup norm about the same time that a bunch of new investors begin arriving from the positive news at the end of last week surrounding the Senate hearings.  That will probably add new input to a second runup, continuing out for another three weeks or so, probably followed by a double correction, one for each of the investment runups.   
My guess would be a final valuation around $1100 or so.
The truth though is that whichever way the market moves is irrelevant to my own strategy.  I'm already all in for money that I'm willing to invest in this market at this level of maturity, and I'm not planning on divesting regardless of the valuation since I'm in it for the long game, not the next two months, regardless of what they hold.

Many small businesses have to compete for consumer attention with much larger businesses.  Because large businesses are slow to adopt new payment systems the Bitcoin ecosystem is primarily made up of small businesses, exchanges, small and specialized hardware manufacturers, and small charities.
If you accept Bitcoin and there is someone in the ecosystem who has Bitcoin to spend, then they are more likely to notice your business than one of the large businesses because there is less overhead in choosing a business that accepts payments in the form of currency you are holding than in having to first exchange the currency and then select a business, and because the Bitcoin community tends to support businesses within the community in preference to other businesses.
Non name-brand coffee shops, restaurants, B&amp;B's, and hotels tend to benefit most from this effect.

Paypal, when they suspect that a chargeback may happen, places a minimum 180 day hold on any funds in the account, which happens to match the typical time that your credit card company will honor a request to reverse a charge against your account.   It also happens to match the typical interval required for a credit card company to settle any payments it owes to a merchant.
Paypal doesn't allow you to get hold of any funds in your account while it is being held.  You cannot touch the money except to refund it to the purchaser.

A rule change on that scale would have to go through some sort of concensus building process with feedback from the entire community including miners and users.  Implementing such a change would be done by placing a marker in the code; blocks beyond point X must conform to this new rule set.  That would allow the world to transition to the new rule set as one.   The actual source code implementing the new rule set would have to be broadly distributed well before the rule was to come into effect.

Ah, I get it.  You are expecting the volatility to decrease uniformly.
The three events of note on the chart are April 2011, April 2013, and November 2013, corresponding to the increase from $1 to $30, $10 to $250, and $130 to $900.
Each of those events has had lower volatility than the one that precedes it.   Comparing July and August 2013 to November 2013 is pointless because the market isn't in the same state during those periods.

And wouldn't it be nice if you could get 600GH/s for less than $48k for immediate delivery.
Alas, the Monarch first units will not be delivered before the end of December (according to Josh, who is reliably 'optimistic' about delivery goals).  If you order now you would be in the follow-on set, which Josh has helpfully estimated at being delivered by the end of February.  Based on previous experience, I can almost certainly assure you that the February scheduled orders will be delivered before November next year.
Meanwhile difficulty is growing exponentially.  In two months 600GH may be earning $600/mo, and in four $60/mo, and in six $6/mo.  By the time you get delivery you will be earning a dollar or two.
Actually, cancel all that.  I have about $600 tied up with Butterfly Labs, currently attached to 1 year mining contracts because I badly misestimated the rise in difficulty over the last 8 months about 7 months ago, because what they were going to send me would have been even less useful than the mining contract, and because they won't refund purchases under any circumstances.  So by all means, join my folly.

So, what happens if Coinbase cancels one of your orders?  If the cash was transferred out of your account it will be refunded in full, and you are back in the same position as you were a week ago.  Since you aren't trying to time the market, and you aren't investing either strategically or tactically you haven't lost anything.  When you eventually get a purchase to go through you'll have some USD value worth of bitcoins, just as you would have had before, and you don't care how many that is because you aren't interested in investing.
If you want to profit short term, then Coinbase isn't your best bet, in my humble opinion.  If you want to profit long term then buying in today or in a month, is all very much the same.  The short term buy in price doesn't affect the long term prospects of bitcoin.   If you aren't interested in investing at all then you plan on buying and selling at a whim, and it really doesn't matter whether you get in at $200, or $2000.  You can buy your bitcoins and play with them to your heart's content regardless of your buy in price.
The thing is, I'm not trying to say you are wrong, I'm just trying to point out what I think that Coinbase is useful for and what its limitations are.  If you know those limitations it can be a useful tool.   If you don't understand them you may end up being disappointed, depending on what the market conditions are like when you happen to buy.

It is hard to draw much in the way of conclusions from purchases on MtGox.   With the USD withdrawals experiencing extended delays it is easy to get stuck with USD deposits that are impossible to withdraw in any other way than by buying Bitcoin to transfer out.
My best guess would be that someone finally managed to cancel an International wire and has decided to move to a more fungible exchange.

Right now you mostly know by reputation and experience.   If MtGox was going to suddenly abscond with all deposits, they would have done so already.   They clearly have had problems, and indeed are still having problems.   There have been rumors that someone at one time might have gotten access to the MtGox account reset email server.   They clearly have problems with withdrawals, making their pricing out of alignment with the other exchanges.   But despite those problems they still seem to be in business for the long haul.   They used to have trading system problems that would lock up their system during DDOS attacks, or when trading volume became too high, but the most recent runup seems to show that those have been solved.
I would ask around and determine what the risks are and try to come up with a plan to mitigate against known risks.  Other than that, you have to start somewhere.   MtGox is probably the most mature of the services, BitStamp seems to have problems defending itself from DDOS attacks and high trade volumes that are similar if less intense than the MtGox problems a couple of years ago.  BTC-e and BTC China both appeared to weather this last runup quite well.

Speaking as someone who bought X amount of hash to be delivered at an unknown date, I concede the point, but would also note that it is a poor business strategy to screw your customers.

Butterfly has delivered a huge amount of new compute power into the network, and from their own order sheets would have known the rate of tail off for devices ordered in this year; but since they never published those numbers it was impossible for anyone buying the devices to accurately estimate that impact.
Net summary, Butterfly purposely continued selling devices well after they knew that anyone buying such a device would be losing money.

Well, the India announcement today did just that.  Is that near term future enough?  Or is it too past?
The good news in the pipeline is pretty well known.  Bad news tends to be a surprise.  Although the eventual sale of the bitcoin seized from the Silk Road is predictable, most government announcements seem to come as a bit of a surprise to almost everyone concerned, and very little of the possible negative news seems to be priced in.
I suppose there could be some exceptionally good news announced somewhere, but bitcoin isn't really the type of invention to attract support from legacy infrastructure.  Much less when the legacy infrastructure is under duress as in Argentina.  Mostly I think that people hope it will stay under the radar until it has become a fait accompli, and when it doesn't they try to figure out how much of a burden the new state restrictions are going to impose.
On the other side of the coin, I think that the US Fed response making it possible to mine bitcoins and exchange them for cash without registering as a money transmitter is a bit of unexpected good news.  Probably better news for mining equipment manufacturers than for bitcoin per se, but good news none the less.

All of the popular exchanges are in operation 24x7.  Or at least attempt to.   Banks, of course only operate on weekdays, so the exchanges *tend* to drop some over the weekend as cash dries up.
For future reference, LocalBitcoins is usually priced above the main market.  You will usually get better prices at one of the exchanges, or from an online site like Coinbase, although these will take a few days to complete their customer identification processes, which in turn can also result in higher prices if the market is changing rapidly.

I get that it feels unfair not to be able to get Bitcoin at the price you thought you were going to pay (and perhaps Coinbase will cover that loss for you, as they have in the past), but it doesn't really have anything to do with 'if you happen to make a short term profit'.
My model for Coinbase's behavior is 'here is the price we will bid on Bitstamp for a bitcoin on your behalf'.  With the recent price volatility those offers just aren't going through.
An intelligent trader would adjust upward as needed to be in the trading zone, or go ahead and buy off of the list of offers, re-entering the bid at a higher price if it didn't get matched to an offer on the first try.  Whatever automatic pricing algorithm Coinbase is using isn't nearly that intelligent.  Watching the bid list on Bitstamp you can often recognize the Coinbase bids as they sit there stacked one on top of the other as the trade price moves away from them.

There are on the order of 11M bitcoin available worldwide to share among all of the users of the currency.  If you want some you will have to find someone who has it and is willing to sell.
If you aren't willing to verify your identity then the exchanges are out, which leaves asking around among your friends, or using LocalBitcoins to find someone who is selling and who preferably lives pretty close to you.  But when you restrict yourself to a small market you can't expect to get the same pricing that you see on the global market.  Supply and demand will affect local markets as well, but most sellers are willing to go through the 'bullshit verification nonsense' to get global prices when they need to, and you live in a society that is flush with local currency, so the question becomes whether you can offer enough to make it worthwhile for someone to sell to you locally.

This misunderstands both what a credit card transaction is and what a bitcoin transaction is.  
A bitcoin transaction does not require mining a block.  Confirming a transaction requires that the transaction appears in a mined block, but there is no technical limit on how many transactions can appear in a block, nor any special requirement that every transaction appear in a block until it needs to be confirmed.  As such bitcoin transactions are more nearly analogous to the payment protocols of a credit card processing system, from fraud examination, to check clearing, to payment processing, to deposit.   
On the other hand, processing an instantaneous transaction on credit is no different for bitcoin than it is for any other payment system, with the exception that there hasn't yet been much call for credit based transaction processing for bitcoin so the infrastructure is limited to a few small test applications such as Coinbase's off blockchain transactions.

Your evidence basically amounts to five people who had their purchases canceled and who believe they shouldn't have been canceled, some of which have since been made whole.
How many people buy from Coinbase in a typical day?
How many of those transactions would result in increased valuations, percentage wise?
How many purchases are cases of actual fraud, and how much does Coinbase typically lose in case of fraudulent sales?
Do you have any evidence that they aren't trigger happy on the risk assessment?   Because that seems a hell of a lot more likely to me than that they are engaging in outright fraud.
What other explanations have you considered and rejected for their behavior?
I can make up rationales for Coinbase just like you.  I say they are being scammed by thieves who steal peoples bank logins.  They use a Bayesian tree to calculate the distance between your order and past cases of theft, and the tree triggered on the amount you happened to buy.  Or the time between purchases.  Or the time between logins.  Or who you bank with, and where you live.  Or the time of day you made your purchase.  Or some asinine parameter that has practically nothing to do with scammers, but what else can they fucking measure.

Each independent miner, and each mining pool in the network checks the validity of your transaction before considering adding it to the block they are currently calculating.  That effectively means that about 30% of the time BTCGuild will be the first validity gate.
Every node in the network, every full client, every web site, and every other miner verifies that the miner that solved the last block correctly checked the validity of its transactions.   Other miners will only consider building on top of blocks that are valid when generating their own next block in the chain.

What assumptions are you using for the mining difficulty, and the delivery date?
For reference, the profitability of mining has been dropping by 90% every two months since June.   So if you begin mining in February (an optimistic estimate) and continue through December, your last month's income would be .001% (0.00001 x) of your first month's income as long as the current trend continues.

I apologize that my information about the NYSE was so woefully outdated.
Anyway, the point I was trying to make about the NYSE wasn't to meant to disrespect the exchange, but to point out that a very large volume of trades can be conducted despite high latencies provided there is enough parallelism in the transaction processing to cope with the overall work.  Even the old ticker-tape trade floor was able to conduct vastly more business on a daily basis than the total value of the bitcoin economy.
My experience with magnetic drives was done using HP 10kRPM SFF drive arrays about four years ago RAID1+0.  We benchmarked them for random throughput over the full surface and over 10% of the surface.  We also benchmarked enterprise grade 1TiB Seagate drives for comparison and got a range of 10 to 100 random seeks per second per drive for queued overlapping asynchronous full surface writes on Debian Etch.   For 10% surface writes on the 10kRPM drives we may have gotten as high as 250 random seeks/sec IIRC.
SSDs are as you point out orders of magnitude faster for random seeks, and that is their primary strength.  We did end up using SSD for our application for exactly that reason, but to mitigate against data loss we also had to write full recovery of the index in the event of SSD data loss since we couldn't guarantee avoiding a three disk event (at 5 sigma) over ten years.
I am aware of some research on in-memory transactions using system uptime guarantees and redundancy to replace persistent writes, but that is currently published theoretical research, not something that I've ever seen in an implemented system.  If you have more information on in memory transactions than I do, I'd really like to read the research or white papers.

It was a mix of reasons.  The technical traders were nervous because the price was high, and the exchanges were having problems due to order volume and denial of service attacks.   And the trading problems popped up at a particularly inopportune moment when China was having a bit of a price correction.
This led to a bit of a panic with anyone who could access their coins transferring them somewhere that was still working and where they could be sold before the dreaded bottom dropped out.
Of course the whole thing was overblown.  I do expect prices to dip some more, personally, but I don't think anyone needs to be worried about long term prospects.  
 The overall news coming out of the US political space was actually much better than I had planned for, and I am still optimistic about the new businesses that are coming online over the next several months.  
US participation was also limited by Coinbase's ability to satisfy demand, so not as many people got carried away with the runup as happened in April. 
I'd expect the next recovery cycle to be a bit shorter, personally.   These are all personal opinions obviously, so feel free to disagree with me.  If you have some strong opinions to the contrary I'd like to hear about them.

Exactly.  Your wallet only contains your keys, the balance that you see is kept on the blockchain, stored on every machine that runs the full bitcoin client anywhere on the network.
If you copy your wallet.dat to a new machine that will be sufficient to see and use your full balance once the new machine has downloaded the full blockchain.
You can check the current up to date balance of any public address on blockchain.info without revealing your private key, or having to wait for Bitcoin-qt to fully synchronize with the network.
For what it is worth, your next most likely heart stopping moment will be when you realize that your address no longer has any coins in it.  Bitcoin-qt creates an invisible change address every time you send any money and deposits the remainder of each transaction there.  Those contents are then used in further transactions and the Bitcoin-qt authors decided it was less confusing to simply hide the additional addresses.  Your wallet.dat will have those addresses as well provided you haven't generated more than a hundred transactions since the last time you made a backup of wallet.dat.  (Keys are pregenerated in blocks of 100)

Yes, a paper wallet is something you can keep and send Bitcoin to that can be unlocked later using a string of numbers and which is not stored on any computer anywhere, and thus not subject to loss by virus or other computer based attack.  
Typically you print both the address and the unlock keys onto a piece of paper from a computer that is disconnected from the network, then remove the information from your computer before reconnecting to the network.  
A reasonable alternative if you want to have quick access to your bitcoin but still want effectively the same level of security is to use an offline wallet (Armory supports this mode) to sign transactions then copy the transaction from your offline computer to a network connected computer by using Sneakernet (aka flash thumb-drives).

It was a simplifying assumption.  My own long term goals are to develop a small stake (~1% my net) in Bitcoin as a medium term investment.  Mining seems like one way of reducing my buy in cost below the current market rate for coins so I don't actually have any plans to dispose of the coins once they are mined, thus present value suits my modeling of the investment value since my own interests go toward constant Bitcoin as opposed to constant dollar value.

The difference was that using Ripple didn't, for me, engender any faith in the future of the technology.  
I say this even though going into the experiment I was very hopeful that Ripple would solve some problems for me.   Ripple claims to be able to convert freely between currencies, and at the time I investigated, claimed to have a degree of cooperation with the Bitcoin community.   I saw Ripple as an ideal way of being able to transfer cash into an exchange to buy and sell Bitcoin instead of the slow and tortuous routes that were offered at that time through payment processors like OKPay, MoneyGram, &amp;c.
What I found is that once inside the Ripple community it is very difficult to get money out.  Even if I bought XRP in the US and transferred them to Bitstamp, I couldn't then use them to buy Bitcoin in a form that could actually be used, just in the form of a credit that I had no control over and could not use on Bitstamp's trade engine.  I couldn't use it to transfer USD to Bitstamp at all, but even if they permitted it, Ripple USD aren't the same thing as USD, just as Ripple Bitcoin aren't the same thing as Bitcoin.  
In the end it was all very disappointing and at its core, in my opinion, useless.

Real people don't spook quite as easily as technical traders.   Granted that a lot of the valuation in Bitcoin is speculative, neither I nor anyone I know personally has the time or inclination to put more money into Bitcoin than we are willing to risk 100% loss of and then watch the price like a hawk.   
I am in Bitcoin because I like the long term prospects.  I think it has advantages that have a good chance of outcompeting existing closed settlement systems and reaching unserved markets.  The daily price changes really aren't that interesting except that they sometimes give me a chance to buy or sell some pocket change without materially affecting my overall strategy.

If all investments were ever to become indexed in bitcoin, which isn't likely IMHO, then the dollar would have no value (no faith implies no value), thus your credit would be easy to repay by liquidating some valuable bitcoin for some worthless dollars in order to pay off the loan.
But while bitcoin makes a useful tool for remittances, especially across long distance, and is likely to become very attractive as a savings instrument, I believe that most business income will continue to be indexed in local currency, just as it is now even when bitcoin payment is accepted.

There is at least a small chance that both of you are telling the truth as you know it.  If the place was busy this dude could have walked in and given 7 bills to someone else, not that it would be your problem if he did except that you'll need him to verify that you aren't the same person he met. 
Alternatively the dude may know where the security cameras are pointed, and have a pretty good idea of how to position himself so it looks on tape like he was headed straight toward your table.  (I doubt Starbucks keeps any cameras pointed at the actual customer tables.)  Then he could wait for you to leave and exit right behind you to make it look like you concluded your deal together.
What you need is a PI to track down this dude's story and verify the documentation until he finds a discrepancy that wasn't planned for.  Where did he withdraw the cash?  Does he have a history of incurring debt, or petty theft?  
It seems to me that this was either an honest mistake or a fairly carefully planned attempt to steal your Bitcoins.   You may know which of you is right, but the escrow company doesn't, so you need to provide ample evidence to support one of these theories and make it stick.
Well, either that, or you could be lying through your teeth.

A post-modernist would argue that upon encountering ideas that violate epistemological assumptions a person bound up in that episteme will label them dangerous nonsense.  I would say that this sounds like just that sort of reaction.
 
In some fundamental way this violates his world view, his core assumptions about how the world works, and that is a very difficult starting point.   To change requires a paradigm shift -- a new way of looking at the world -- that can be very difficult for someone who wants or needs to understand all of the implications of the new paradigm before accepting it.   What will America be once this shift has happened.  Will it still be like us?  Will my job, and my role in society still be secure?   Will my family be safe, and will I be able to feed them?
My view is that Bitcoin could eventually, if it is wildly popular, take away one tool that government uses to shape society, the largely invisible tool of monetary policy.   In addition the philosophy underlying Bitcoin itself tends to value savings over spending which would represent a sea change for American behavior, but the government still has many other tools at its disposal that could be used to mitigate or even invert that tendency.  Taxes for example, while not as invisible as monetary policy, can be used to move money in nearly the same ways, and are more politically responsive to the will of the people.

It really isn't likely that Coinbase would steal from you.  They are at least a couple of million dollar company so the down side for them in good will would be much too costly to warrant thieving a couple of thousand dollars from your account.
On the other hand, Coinbase has frequently had growing pains that have led to failed transactions that have had to be resubmitted, and although I haven't heard of it being an issue in the past, I can imagine that support delays could be lengthening as well (their standard for support requests seems to be about 2-3 days from other reports here.)
But the first thing I would guess at is that your support request got lost in the system somewhere.   I haven't used Coinbase support yet: Do they email you a response?  Or is it sent to a messaging system within the Coinbase web interface?   If I had assured myself that I hadn't missed their response in a spam filtered folder, etc., then I'd resubmit and wait another three days for a response.

Banks have had to live with scams for a lot longer than Bitcoin has.  One of the popular scams run on banks in the early 1900's was using the disparity between deposit credit time and check cashing time to run up very high balances on the interval between them.  With numerous high value checks being deposited on a regular basis, and more waiting to be honored, banks would routinely honor outgoing checks even though inbound checks hadn't yet been cleared.
The last step of the scam was to send one check from each account to a final bank and cash out as soon as they cleared.
ACH is slow because it duplicates the manual process of clearing checks that became necessary after this scam became popular, and involves a series of holds, verifications, and waits.

Bitcoin-qt pregenerates a hundred keys and stores them in the wallet.dat well before they are used.   When using an old wallet.dat it can take a while before the correct balance is displayed though.

What actually gets spent when you conduct a transaction in bitcoin is that a transaction (or a group of transactions) that references one of the addresses that you control as outputs are rewritten as new transactions that reference your addresses as inputs.
When you look at your account on blockchain.info they have no way of knowing what addresses are associated with your wallet, so they only show you coins that are attached to a single address at a time.   When you make a payment the change from that payment typically gets sent to a new address that is linked to your wallet, but not to your old address.  Thus when looking at blockchain, when you examine your primary address you will only see transactions that have not been spent.  You can recombine all of your transactions by making a payment to yourself that collects all of the inputs and places them into a single address.

It seems pretty clear to me that the OP read some books on day trading strategies and thought it would be fun to apply them.  Stop loss is something you do in order to raise the level of risk/reward in a fairly stable market by investing more than you can afford to lose.  Bitcoin has plenty of volatility built in, there is never any reason to invest more than you can afford to lose, thus your stop loss level should be zero.
All I can say is that it is lucky for him that the markets are too immature to have added short sells and margin trading, or he would be sitting on complete losses of investment.

Perhaps not.  Bitcoin isn't applicable to every niche of every market in the world.
For clarification, what is the cost to you of challenging a chargeback?  How much time does it take?  How does it impact your record keeping if at all?  How much attempted fraud do you encounter?  
While double spends are a plausible problem, a customer would have to go out of their way to make one happen.   Still, zero confirmation sales are usually limited to situations where either you know and trust your customers, or the sale can be voided without significant loss in the case of a double spend, or there is a third party guaranteeing the transaction who already has the coins on deposit, or takes place entirely within an off-chain micro-transaction provider (like Coinbase), or double spends cannot arrive soon enough to displace the first spend (most Gambling sites).
In many services industries the total bill amount will be available long before the customer is ready to leave; in these cases it is often worthwhile to ask bitcoin customers to pay up front so that their transactions can confirm before they need to leave.

Stop loss generally isn't worthwhile with bitcoin.  If you are over invested just liquidate the part that you don't want to risk.  Bitcoin is more than volatile enough on its own so that over investing just makes you over exposed to risk with no upside since your limit is likely to be hit even in unexceptional trading.

I agree.  
Among other things Ponzi schemes don't ever recover after they collapse.  
In a Ponzi scheme what was seemingly a very successful investment fund consumes itself paying off early investors and when the scheme collapses there is no value left to build from.
Bitcoin the unit of currency is arbitrary and possibly hard to value, but the value isn't in the unit of currency so much as it is in the network, the payment infrastructure, and in the trust of its users.  It has that worth even when speculation results in over valued units of Bitcoin, and even when the speculative bubble blows that value remains to be built upon.

In the image that you linked above, the bid at $210 is in the process of executing (green).  Since it still has 728btc to go before completing it will have to be matched against a fairly large number of smaller offers before it is complete, and the buyer decided to place a limit on how much he or she is willing to pay for those BTC.  The highest price that the buy order will execute at is $210; as it is matched against specific smaller offers the buy order will be completed piecemeal and probably at prices below the offer, and completed as quickly as the trading platform can perform the transactions.

If it really isn't going to be a loss then the right thing to do is rebase your investment.   So the question is do you believe in the technology or not?
As it happens I do.  Thus I am slowly buying right now, although I'll wait until I've seen the bottom before going all in.    But lets say you invested $1200 to buy 1 Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is now half that, so for less than $600 I can increase my holding to 2 Bitcoin for a new basis of $900.   Doubling my investment for a 50% increase in my risk profile is usually a good idea, but it depends on how close you are to your investment limits and thus what you are still willing to risk.

In itself mining only ensures that a large number of machines have looked at the transactions in the block.  The validity of those transactions is ensured by having at least a majority of miners running a set of validity checks on the transactions that they all agree on.  
But because the longest valid chain (actually the chain with the highest cumulative difficulty) is consider the most reliable one, someone with 51% hashing power could out pace the honest minority and eventually publish a set of transactions that contradict what was earlier agreed to be valid.
The actual check for a valid spend is to check the new transaction against a list of unspent transactions, and verify that each input is previously unspent.  If someone tries to double spend in the same block then one of the two transactions will be included in the actual output block.  If two different miners come up with solutions at nearly the same time then only one of those blocks will eventually form the basis for the next block in the merkle tree, so one of the two solutions will have to be abandoned.  Which one is abandoned depends on the next block, but splits in the tree tend not to live for more than a block or two.

There are not Bitcoin for Credit Card sites for the same reason that there are not Cash for Credit Card sites.

It depends on where you keep your Bitcoin.  If you are holding them yourself then you will generally need to wait about an hour after someone has sent you Bitcoin before you can send it somewhere else.  
If you have them send directly to your exchange (your Coinbase wallet for example) then you can cut that time in half, but the ACH transfer will still take 4-5 banking days to clear.  If you go through a service that converts Bitcoin to cash directly they will charge an exchange fee of about 1% and convert your receipts into local currency automatically as they are received and deposit them by the method you've agreed to, but typically this will still have the same 4-5 day ACH clearing duration.)

In the US, by far the easiest and least expensive way to buy BTC is through coinbase.com.  
The barrier to entry is high right now because most of the old exchange mechanisms relied on various payment systems each of which added a point of failure and a mandatory profit margin to the transaction.   
The old exchangers have mostly been either shut down due to regulatory issues or their bankers getting cold feet.  The new set of exchangers are just now coming on line and doing their paperwork properly with an order of magnitude more backing than their predecessors.
Of those, only coinbase is actively exchanging USD for BTC from direct bank transfers right now, and even they have had a few growing pains.
If you are near NYC or SF you could also try going to a Buttonwood Satoshi Square exchange, or check LocalBitcoin to see if those fit your needs.

The source code for the Bitcoin client is open source.  You can rewrite it to enact any set of rules you consider valuable.  The end result will not be accepted by the other Bitcoin miners so it simply wouldn't be possible for you to use that to get your client to make new Bitcoins without following the rules that make your blocks acceptable to the network.  
But that won't stop you from setting up your own network, and accepting your own blocks.  If your bitcoin clone is vastly superior in some respect to original Bitcoin you might even eventually supplant Bitcoin.  Many many people are trying to do so, which is why there are dozens of so called alt-coins; other cryptocurrencies based on the same code with modifications to parameters or algorithms that their authors hope will make them more useful over the long run than Bitcoin.

I should add that payment delays aren't necessarily your problem, they could easily be the purchaser's problem.  Even if you want to wait out the full 6 blocks recommended by Satoshi, most bitcoin users understand that the currency is experimental and will accept the limitations that have to be imposed to handle transactions to a business' required level of trust.
To a degree then, we are still working out what the protocol should be for buying things in situations like yours.  Perhaps the solution is to provide the buyer a receipt and tell them to return after an hour, or even a day to pick up their instrument.  They always have the option of paying by more usual means if they want the instrument immediately.

If you wanted to you could alter the source code to make it look like you have more bitcoin than you do.  What would be the point?
Bitcoin uses a global distributed ledger to track the creation and exchange of bitcoin transactions.  Regardless of what your computer shows you, you won't be able to transmit any transaction that references an account you don't have the keys for, nor will you be able to transmit any transaction that doesn't derive from a previous transaction (or set of transactions) or from a mining reward.
There is no central server, but your copy of the file isn't important, it is everyone else whose copies you have to be compliant with.  If you try to transmit an invalid transaction then no miner will incorporate that transaction into the ledger blockchain, and whoever you are trying to send to will point out that they never received your coins.
Sadly, in order for you to even attempt to replace a block in the original blockchain with one of your own, you would have to recalculate all of the hashes from the point at which you changed the history up to now, and you would have to do so faster than the entire network of miners is calculating new blocks, and your block would still have to be compliant with the rules enforced by all miners or it wouldn't be accepted despite being more powerfully hashed.
At present you might be able to technically accomplish this feat for less than a billion dollars.   But it would not go unnoticed.

ASIC/FP resistant hashing isn't a bad thing.  It is much too insignificant to be either good or bad outside a very narrow band of interest.
What lends both LTC and BTC their value are the market opportunities that are enabled by the technologies; the infrastructure of goods and services that are built on top of the core technology.   
Between competing markets there will be winners and losers provided there is an open field in which to compete.  Bitcoin is partially protected from competition with the USD by barriers that are in place that prevent the dollar from being moved in certain ways, or to be more blunt, Bitcoin can effectively compete with legacy proprietary closed settlement protocols by being the first open settlement protocol open to all comers.
LTC has no such protection from Bitcoin, and unless it finds a niche in which Bitcoin can't compete, or unless it can consistently outpace the growth of Bitoin by extending its goods and services more quickly than Bitcoin is able to, it is not going to win.

I usually advise friends that while I think that the outlook for Bitcoin is very positive, that bad news could quickly change that prediction.   And further, I find it easier to invest when the price is at a plateau than when it is racing upward.  
From a plateau it is easy to cost average your buy in price which reduces the risk of buying on a really bad day.   Also from a plateau it really just takes patience to see your investment increase in value assuming you are bullish on the long term prospects of Bitcoin.

It isn't even similar to a Ponzi scheme, and nothing you have described above has anything in common with Ponzi schemes.   
In a Ponzi scheme there is no point in creating new investments; you put all of your effort into showing that your investment strategy is working by using new investors deposits to pay off the guaranteed returns promised to earlier investors.   Creating a new investment would be counterproductive and cut short the time you could keep people believing that your first investment was legit.
I see no evidence that BFL is doing anything of the sort.  BFL isn't guaranteeing a return rate, they are delivering hardware with a performance guarantee, not a profit guarantee.  They appear to be using income from presales to develop new hardware; not something I would recommend buying into normally, but not a Ponzi scheme.  Ponzi schemes don't need any real hardware or performance plan since all of the apparently good returns can simply be delivered by lying about where you got the money from to pay people with.

Yes and no.  You could sign a transaction, give it to someone to prove that you could pay the fee agreed, but ask them not to submit it to the network yet.  The net result of such a ruse would be that they receiver of the transaction would not be protected from a double spend.  
In the event of a double spend (sending the same bitcoins to two different destinations), it is the first one to make it onto the blockchain that wins.

If it were to follow the same pattern as last time the price would peak at ~$1100, then crash to ~$400 over a period of several weeks, followed by a 4 month malaise before slowly climbing back up.
I don't know that it will follow the same pattern though, and the situation doesn't exactly match.
One thing I think works in Bitcoin's favor is that all of the exchanges operate 24hrs a day, meaning that as technical traders get more uncomfortable with the current pricing they eventually have to cash out to get some sleep.  
This limits how out of control the prices can get before there is a correction.

It isn't a bubble in that sense.   Bitcoin valuation is dependent upon the utility of the market that uses it.  If the market is used the the currency will be used, and as it is used for more things at the same time its value goes up.  If the market dwindles the real value will drop and speculative investment will drop as well.
The question is whether the market will survive competition with existing payment and settlement systems.  Right now Bitcoin can compete asymmetrically with existing payment systems by ignoring the political and social boundaries to monetary exchange that artificially restrict certain payments.  Even payments for legal goods can be confounded by barriers such as risk of fraud, or confiscation by parties that may or may not themselves be operating legally.  
Bitcoin solves some of those problems.  You can use bitcoin to pay for online gambling for example, which you can't do with credit cards due to concerns over transmitting funds for gambling through US jurisdictions and having them seized.   You can buy from countries that have currency controls that make it very difficult to wire money to a perfectly legal business.   You can also make payments that incur relatively low processing fees and that are for relatively small cash values.

There have been on average about two reports a week of thefts from MtGox by a variety of means over the last three months.   Such reports are so routine actually that the first question out of anyone will be "did you have two factor authentication turned on?"   
The only one to make it to the front page was one where two factor authentication was enabled and someone managed to access an account despite that precaution.  Hopefully your warning will make it to the front page if only for the magnitude of the loss.
At this point I consider it fairly likely that someone has come up with a method of either intercepting or predicting MtGox password reset emails.  In addition there are clearly several Phishing sites dedicated to capturing logins intended for MtGox, and numerous people trying to attack the site though its programmatic API (which may have been default enabled at one point), or by password guessing using automatic tools.
MtGox is at this point probably one of the least secure places to leave Bitcoins on deposit, if only because a huge proportion of the attempted attacks on Bitcoin are directed their way.

How much do you think the liquidated assets of Butterfly would be worth?  
I am plenty pissed at BFL but trying to get cash back out is probably a losing proposition.  The only realistic way to get value out of BFL, in my opinion, is to encourage them to drop prices on their equipment to the point that they are at least break even by offering performance upgrades at cut rates to customers lost on the tail end of this performance curve.
Chips are relatively cheap in bulk.  If they can pull down board manufacturing costs or fully populate the boards they deliver then I think they would stand a chance of satisfying customer expectations without having the cost of developing a new chip on very limited new income.

So around half of the orders are abandoned before being paid and the impact of the current sales on the hash rate might come in around 150TH.  Of course if the KnC chips become reality, their reportedly 25nm process should be able to bump that up another order of magnitude assuming they eventually bring their pricing into proportion with the unit cost of their chips.

Smaller transactions (in bytes) with larger transaction fees (in bitcoin) will be prioritized when blocks are full.
Ideally small transactions that don't need to be on the block chain shouldn't be on the block chain.  Even without damaging fungibility, if there are multiple market places where you can trade in small transaction values the only transactions that need to make it onto the block chain are deposits, withdrawals, and periodic cross exchange settlements.
Within an marketplace customer accounts can be kept distinct within a local database, as is done for example at Coinbase.

Apples and oranges.   An exponential runup in value is unsustainable in practice.   An exponential runup in inflation in the referenced currency doesn't run up the value of Bitcoin, it just inflates the value of the referenced currency and is a red herring.
Since the economy doesn't grow exponentially, Bitcoin can't grow exponentially and still represent economic value.  And adoption doesn't grow exponentially -- adoption curves can look exponential at early points, but have a well defined shape that tails off as the market matures.

The point about regulation is with regard to the creation of ASICs but the regulation of Bitcoin by application of pressure at a small number of points.   If there is one (or a few) main mining companies then it is relatively trivial for those companies to change the rules for bitcoin by for example, only signing transactions if the source and destination addresses are both registered public addresses vetted by an identification agency.
By splitting the mining up over a very large population Satoshi hoped to ensure that no small group of individuals, corporations, or countries could come to the point of generating enough hashing to alter the fundamental principles which bitcoin was trying to establish.

Instant is awfully fast.  On the NYSE trades will realistically take a minimum of several seconds up to a minute to execute.   For an all digital exchange it depends on the transaction volume and how many transactions their back end can execute at a time.   
Each transaction has to pair an ask with a bid.   Completed orders need to be removed from the order list.  Incomplete orders need to be updated.  Orders cannot be executed multiple times so the system must lock the entries while they are being matched.   Each transaction has to be fully persistently logged or needs an ACID commit into a database before it can be considered complete.  
Considering that magnetic hard drives can do between 10 and 100 random seeks per second, I'm not certain that you can expect a much higher transaction rate than what is being demonstrated without losing either accuracy or requiring dependence on hardware such as SSDs, that don't have a great track record when it comes to reliable records management.

If you are interested you can read the charts and judge for yourself:

Yeah, pretty close.
You have a crypto key which is a public/private keypair, and that is represented by one account, or payment address in your wallet.  The private key is used to authenticate transfers of incoming transactions to outbound transactions.   The public key is used to verify that you have the private key for the wallet account listed as the receiver in the inbound transactions.  Inputs and Outputs in a transaction add up to zero (or almost zero if you are paying a fee to the miners for including your block in the block chain).

It sounds to me like you want BFL to have delivered before the difficulty went through the roof.   
My opinion is that it is because BFL is delivering that the difficulty is going through the roof.   If their products had been available six months earlier then we'd have been having almost exactly the same pain six months ago.  
Obviously there have also been other ASIC deliveries in the same time frame, but frankly those guys are having the same problems we are; any equipment delivered after the first batch or so is going to be profitable about the time hell freezes over.
Now the 22nm parts are breathing down our necks before we can finish paying off our own parts, but that, in my opinion, was the gamble I took when I bought the parts.  Complaining about it failing to pay off now is trying to blame someone else for my own inability to predict the future.

It would require a loss of faith in bitcoin and its future on a scale that isn't very likely, but there are a couple of plausible scenarios that I can think of that would do that.  Global thermonuclear war for example would play havoc with the internet, and thus internet based currency would be fairly irrelevant in the overall struggle to survive.
A less destructive scenario might involve the discovery of a new branch of mathematics that suddenly exposes any of the cryptographic algorithms used in bitcoin to cryptanalysis.   This is a bit less likely than global nuclear war, but still within the realm of possibility.
Lastly, if any one person who is holding say $100M in bitcoin suddenly needed to liquidate their holdings then bitcoin might reach $2 before the end of the sale, though bargain buyers would probably flood the market at that point to some level of recovery.  I know I would.

Personally I don't even like allowing an instant buy of 10BTC.  Have you considered what would happen if someone manages to break in to your account?

You and every monkey's uncle.
Coinbase's maximum throughput is limited by the amount of cash that they have on hand.  When they run out they have to wait for some to arrive from earlier purchases before they can buy bitcoin for you.   Thus the error message you are getting.
If you check back in periodically you might happen to catch them when they have released a new block of cash for additional purchases instead of having to wait for Monday.
Otherwise you'll need to have cash on deposit at an exchange so that you can make the purchases yourself, or else trade with someone local who already has bitcoins and is willing to sell them: localbitcoins.com

I thought about it for a while and updated my previous comment in more detail.   The problem, for me, is the lack of negotiability of the Ripple based credits.  This is particularly onerous when the thing being negotiated is a virtual currency like Bitcoin which should be universally negotiable among retailers that accept it.   But even in the case of fiat currencies like USD, the transfer of the credit should be the same as the transfer of the currency itself.  That isn't the case though with Ripple, which because it doesn't provide any agreed settlement protocol among creditors, doesn't encourage those creditors to treat their credits as equivalent to cash.  So even with USD on deposit somewhere, I can't actually use it for anything.
I don't think integration with a big bank will help nearly as much as integration with Cirrus, or Star would, or some form of credit clearing.  Likewise for Bitcoin, after conversion to Bitcoin what you get out should be Bitcoin, not something else that might or might not be exchangeable for Bitcoin but can't itself be used.

The real value of Bitcoin is derived from the size of its market, including the goods and services that are dependent on Bitcoin as well as the speculative market represented by the trading depth at the various public Bitcoin exchanges.
It is possible to treat Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, in which case you are fundamentally investing in the future growth of the Bitcoin market.   Any bargain you may think you are getting has to be mitigated by how much speculation is going on in Bitcoin at the time you choose to buy.   Bitcoin has periodic speculative runups in value.  These provide valuable liquidity to the market and expand the potential base of Businesses that can use Bitcoin, but anyone investing speculatively should assess for themselves how comfortable they are with the current prices and should avoid investing more than they can afford to lose.

I'm not a cryptographer, so take this with a grain of salt.
My understanding is that ECC is widely regarded in the crypto community as having about ~~three~~ twenty times the strength per bit as RSA public key crypto.

Arguably the value of all bitcoins combined cannot exceed the combined value of all of the commerce conducted in bitcoin by more than some factor (lets call it a trust factor) without hitting a wall of disbelief.
As bitcoin valuation begins to exceed that wall those who don't believe in the current valuation will begin selling bringing the value back in line with trust.

You might be missing out on some of the best hand crafted shoes made in the world that are available for under $1000, but some people will buy, and the world market will open up to small businesses, even ones located in backward Iran.
The point about embargoed versus non-embargoed goods is that it doesn't have to involve smuggling or blockade running, or even run afoul of the law.  Payment processors won't forward money to Iran because it is risky.  Money sent to Iran can be seized for months or years while the US or some other intervening country works out whether the payment is legitimate or not.  But it doesn't have to be shoes.  It could be information, WikiLeaks for example, which had all of their other payment processors close their accounts -- not for any legal reason, just for the sake of politics.   It could be an online Casino running out of a jurisdiction where such things are legal.   There are many ways in which money policy shapes and controls access to perfectly legal endeavors at the behest of political interests.
Bitcoin is just data, and the data never needs to leave the blockchain.  It remains where it is, shared between all of the users who care to mirror it.  Anyone who is interested can build goods or services on top of it, without reference to which country, political affiliation, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, or race they may be.  The prerequisite is that you have access to the internet, and that is all.
As for how subversive Bitcoin is, in my opinion Bitcoin is just as deeply subversive as only freedom can be.

In principle I'm inclined to agree that Bitcoin is currently overvalued, but I don't think that it is overvalued for a year from now which makes it risky to sell off a lot now since there isn't as much time as I would like to wait for a market correction before it would be back as high or higher than it is now.
Bitcoin will grow at least another 2-3 orders of magnitude in market depth before it will support a wide variety of international manufacturing, and another couple of orders beyond that to support daily global online business transactions.   
Of course it may never grow to encompass those uses, but that is the long term basis for my optimism regarding the future of Bitcoin, and to me it seems well suited to those uses if currently too small in volume to make them practical right now.

If you are already at your investment limit then your only choice is to either take the loss or stay in and wait for the price to increase.
If you aren't yet at your investment limit then you can reprice your investment by buying more coins now that the price is lower, giving you more flexibility when you eventually decide to sell.
My own interest is in developing a small stake in Bitcoin as a long term investment, so low prices now are dropping the dollar cost of developing that stake making me a pretty happy person these last few weeks, although a deeper drop would also be welcome.
My intuition is that Bitcoin utility is increasing, new businesses are coming online, the scope is expanding.  There is a lot of current investment that hasn't paid off yet so prices are depressed while those new businesses come on line, (and to an extent I think that MtGox's troubles are also causing price problems, although I don't give that as much credit as most people because I think that the dark liquidity pools probably have an equivalent power to convert currency) but I fully expect Bitcoin to gain in value in the long term provided there isn't any really bad news that surprises everyone.

If you sell through an exchange then you have the opportunity to place buy and sell orders at a set price and wait for them to be fulfilled at that price.  If the price moves away from your order then it will remain unfulfilled.  For this kind of trading you need an account on Bitstamp, or another similar exchange, and you should examine the fees involved in depositing, withdrawal, and trading.   Some will be from the exchange itself, and others will be from your bank, or from the intermediate banks that enable the international funds transfer.
For trading using a customer oriented exchange such as Coinbase, provided that you have gotten to the stage where you can make instant purchases, any sale you make should be executed at the price quoted to you and deposited to your bank account within a week.  If you can't make an instant purchase then you would have to wait for your payment to clear before your purchased bitcoin will be unlocked for sale.

On the plus side, even if the FBI were to dump all of the Silk Road stash onto the market in a day (presumably because they don't give a damn), the ultimate effect would only be to increase the actively traded monetary base.  Regardless of their intentions, they cannot put more bitcoin into the market than they have seized.  
So yes, the market valuation would change to encompass the new bitcoin, but the value of the market wouldn't be significantly affected, just the proportion of the actively traded market that you have control over.  
If you believe in the market then what that really means is that you have an opportunity to invest at what may be a generational low point.  You could also divest beforehand of current holdings, but if you do you bear the risk that the market won't react the way you expect it to.
My expectation is that it will put a damper on growth as the end of the trial draws near, possibly mitigated by whatever guidance the FBI offers on how they will liquidate the seized coins.

You can send bitcoin from one wallet to another.  There is typically no fee involved, but there can be a smallish fee depending on how small the transaction is and how old the coins that you are transferring are.
You can also export a key from one wallet and import it into another one, in which case the coins associated with that key will be able to be spent from either location.   This is how you spend coins sent to a paper wallet for example.
You can have as many active wallets as you care to keep track of.

Actually with 1000 coins you could probably attract an investor who would pay a modest premium to get them all at once without alerting the market to their acquisition.   There have been several buyers who reportedly want to invest at least $1M in Bitcoin provided they can find someone who will sell at a reasonable markup over Mt. Gox.  See for example sfbay.craigslist.org.

The stability of Bitcoin is already improving.  The average volatility during this runup was less than half of the volatility during the April runup, which in turn was significantly less volatile than the runup two years previous.  
This is purely observation.  My expectation is that the volatility will continue to decrease as Bitcoin survives regulatory hurdles and as the market becomes more broadly adopted by business.   
That said, any period of rapid adoption such as this runup will obviously have more volatility than a period like June-September where growth was much more systemic.

Like most things, the reasons are complex, but the main contributing factors were excessive speculation in land trusts that overvalued swampland in Florida, and excessive leverage combined with mania surrounding the aforementioned trust driven valuation bubble.
The dropping of the gold standard happened as a result of the stock market crash, not the other way around.   Cash based on the gold standard caused restricted monetary supply as anyone who had money elected not to loan it out given the high default rate as the market constricted as the stock market crash proceeded.   This caused a severe shortage of capital bringing the economy to a standstill.  To combat this the government decided to start printing money without adequate gold reserves to back the currency, and upon doing so anyone holding gold certificates decided that it would be a better strategy to exchange them for gold than to be left holding a promise for gold that could not be fulfilled.
This in turn forced us to drop the gold standard.

Kind of risky right now, but at least your dad was interested in the benefits of Bitcoin, not just in the speculative value.  The difference is how you behave if there happens to be an inflection point in the next couple of days.
If you value what Bitcoin can do for spending and saving then you might wait for the bottom of a sharp drop and be happy that you can buy more and lower your average cost.  If you only value it as a get rich scheme then you tend to invest too much and buy high/sell low.

It is surprising how often this gets posted.  50BTC was the victim of a hack a few months ago, and the thieves accomplished the deed by badly corrupting their database.  They have no clue how many BTC they owe to anyone, their online payment wallet was emptied, and they have no idea where the vulnerability started so they are in the process of rewriting their accounting software from scratch.
Or not.  Anyway, suffice it to say they don't owe you 399 bitcoins, any more than they owe me 279 bitcoins.  My balance pre hack was about .005 BTC IIRC, but even that is moot since they are broke.

It is kind of funny reading your comments to me, one praising me for being insightful, and the other suggesting that I should take advice from semi-literate buffoons.
Although it was clear even at the time that bitcoin was due for a correction, was clearly just trolling the forum.  His bald statement that the OP's dad would 'lose it all' simply isn't borne out.  There is immense value in the bitcoin marketplace and I remain convinced that it has long term promise.
But there is a line to walk between the systemic growth of the market and the speculative growth of those who see bitcoin as a get rich scheme, and while the latter can be of value to the community by bringing cash into the marketplace and thereby extending the business uses that can be reached, there is a cycle to such things and speculative investment deep into the runup was indeed risky.

In the US it is possible for law enforcement to seize the storage device or devices that you use to store your keys which effectively will freeze your wallet if you don't have backups that are beyond their reach.  
In most states law enforcement can also order the forfeiture of any asset associated with the commission of a crime, and you can be held indefinitely without bail in some cases if you refuse to hand over any evidence related to a crime.  
You could also be charged with obstruction of justice for destroying or concealing evidence related to a crime.
Lastly, if you are the subject of a sting operation and your computer is being monitored in connection with that sting, you may end up revealing your keys in a way that allows law enforcement to seize your wallet balance by moving those balances to an account that you don't control.
Still, even with all of those caveats, it is possible with advance planning to make it effectively impossible for law enforcement to seize your account without your cooperation.

Remember that checkbox that said that your purchase would be completed at the current market rate once your funds were received by Coinbase?   That is what happened.
If the price had continued to drop for the last two days then you would have received more than 1 bitcoin.
When they have cash in stock they buy in advance and give you the full amount purchased regardless of the current price.   In your case they were out of cash and posted a warning and required you to check a checkbox before you could check out.
If you believe that this doesn't apply to your situation then I would recommend contacting Coinbase.

Over the long term I am pretty sure that, absent external forces, a deflationary economy would tend to decrease efficiency, emphasize small business over large scale manufacturing, and bespoke or custom products over mass created products.  Instead of buying a new car you would have your car serviced and repaired as needed.  It might even be worthwhile to have parts custom machined rather than buy a whole new vehicle.   Quality would most likely win over quantity in such a world.
In Japan in the 1990s taxes were used as the main incentive to continue gross manufacturing investments going.   In that case losing 2 bitcoins to a manufacturing cycle might be preferable to losing 4 bitcoins to taxes.

What I'd really like to see is a way to do the reverse.  Pay with a Coinbase Visa debit card and have it convert enough BTC from my account to cover the charge, or refuse the charge if my BTC balance won't cover the purchase.
The upside is that it would be much easier to keep a pseudo-checking account in BTC if I didn't have to remember to move BTC to my usual checking account several days before I need it, and it would work almost anywhere.
For Coinbase it would represent an additional source of profit since they could take advantage of the float and the top fee paid by the merchants.
The only downside (AFAICT) is that it replaces the cash-like aspects of Bitcoin with the typical credit tracking policies of Visa, which is substantial, but not enough to make me not use it in businesses that don't accept BTC.

To actually get colored bitcoins to work, if they ever do work, the wallet clients will first have to add code to keep the colored coins compartmentalized.  A general marking of coins as unspendable wouldn't really be feasible without that support as coins are intermixed.   Without such support at best you could say that a transaction chain includes a transaction that was at one time colored; say 1% orange and 99% uncolored.

What is unsubstantiated are claims that: "[Coinbase] take the money from your bank account and sit on it a few days to play the market. If the price of BTC goes up after you order it, they make serious money and just cancel your transaction..."
I get that you don't like having your transactions cancelled, that it feels completely unfair when they won't even tell you why their system considers you high risk, and that whatever business problems they are having separating out transactions that are high risk shouldn't be affecting honest customers.  
I would even agree with those statements.  What I find appalling is making up stories about outright fraud without a shred of evidence to back it up other than that you are pissed off.

There are several assumptions in this that don't add up.   First the primary expense of mining (and thus its limiting factor) isn't the electricity but rather the hashing hardware.   And while users will probably operating their hashing hardware up to 100% electrical cost, inability to pay off the hardware will limit the rate of increase.
~~Secondly, even if all of the cost of mining could be attributed to electricity, 8.2Mt of CO2 is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the value of the bitcoins that will be mined this year at $1k/Bitcoin.  Using the method as described, 90% of 1.3M bitcoins   the most CO2 that could be assigned to bitcoin mining would be 1.18Mt of CO2, and that value will of course drop every four years or so when the block rewards are reduced.~~

An ACH transfer is a little bit like an automatic electronic check.   If you buy a bitcoin then Coinbase will initiate a transfer ASAP.  At that point the 'check is in the mail'.   
Your bank might give you the ability to stop a check, or dispute an ACH withdrawal.  Indeed you might not even have sufficient funds to cover the transaction in your account.  Each of those are problems that Coinbase no doubt encounters several times each day.  But I doubt that they allow it to happen with the same customer twice.

There is no good balance of price and speed right now.  Presales have made the ASIC mining market sell far more equipment than can be profitable, and new generations of equipment are arriving only a month or two apart from one another.
The two newest entrants are KnC Miner (predicted delivery in November), and CoinTerra (predicted delivery in December).  Both claim to have experienced teams working on their hardware, and to be on schedule for release.  KnC comes in at about $20/GH, while CoinTerra comes in at about $7/GH.   
If you order from either one you will be up against everyone else in the world who thinks they can make a quick buck mining Bitcoin; but as you should know, more hashing doesn't mean more bitcoins, just smaller slices from the same pool.
Your best bet is to choose the newest hardware available, but almost any hardware you choose could suffer delivery delays, startup failure, or be made obsolete by the next company to announce their products.

Buy an ASIC miner, connect it to a computer you can leave on 24x7, join a mining pool, run the software.  
There are instructions on almost every mining pool web site for how to connect.  The most popular mining software tools right now are probably cgminer and bfgminer.
You will probably need to build them from source unless you have a windows machine you will be using for the mining host.  
Here is a typical setup page (this is for Butterfly Labs equipment which is about $50/GH for the current generation miners, which will currently pay about $0.50/GH/day, dropping to $.05/GH/day in three months.   Break even is 4-7yrs with free electricity at current Bitcoin prices established in Bitcoin, but without the flexibility of owning the Bitcoin up front.)

It seems to me that if you can deposit USD into MtGox you should be able to deposit USD into a foreign bank account at any brokerage service.  You might have better luck pulling money from eTrade than from MtGox when in the USA.
Putting your savings into Bitcoin would only be of particular use if you can get a reasonable exchange rate from RM to XBT, covering the amount of coin you want to buy, all of which depends on local conditions, or if you need to transport value that you can't export from Malaysia in any other way.

I used Ripple for about six months, performing several exchanges along the way, including to USD, BTC, DYM (silver dimes), and of course XRP.
For me the fatal flaw in Ripple is that it requires the user to establish a trust in a Ripple exchange, and then uses that trust to move debt from one person to another, but when it comes to actually using that debt to do something the system is completely opaque.  You end up having to read through the web site at each exchange where you have credit to figure out how to withdraw the kind of currency they are holding for you from the exchange, and that information is often completely buried or even undocumented.
I could 'trust' Bitstamp to hold debt for me, but to actually turn that into bitcoin that I could withdraw requires me to submit ID to Bitstamp, then send the bitcoin to Bitstamp care of myself as a new ripple transaction, all to get the bitcoin into a non-ripple bitcoin account, before I could send it out.   It was slow and painful, and I ended up losing about half a bitcoin in the experiment, mostly due to the way that currency is converted.  Every currency has to be exchanged with XRP before it can be converted into another denomination, but holding XRP is nearly useless, hard to get, and even harder to sell without taking a sizable loss on each exchange.

I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456.   If you can guess my number you can unlock my bitcoins.  Good luck.
The science of cryptography is based on keeping some small piece of data secret that unlocks a whole message.   Anyone can examine the algorithm used, and the keyspace is well defined.   Consider for example the use of a pass-phrase to identify yourself to other spies.   Yes, you know that the passphrase consists of words from some language on earth, so you could guess the phrase, right? 
Within cryptography there is the concept of entropy.  At a certain point if you have enough entropy then a key becomes unguessable because the space in which the guessing is to take place is too vast.  This is what happens with Bitcoin.  Yes, the keys are just numbers and could in principle be guessed, but they come from an entropy pool that includes enough randomness that there just isn't any way to go about guessing them before the sun turns into a red giant and consumes the earth.
Now, that doesn't mean that all wallets are secure, but for an attacker it would be cheaper (electricity costs money) and more lucrative to play the lottery millions of times than to attack a well secured wallet.  Where wallet security fails is when the private keys are generated by a not-very-random process.  Let's say you are using a passphrase to generate your keys, but you don't like the random phrases that are generated by the DiceWare algorithm.  You want to use the lyrics from your favorite song.  Or the first ten words of the last page of your favorite book.   While these might be memorable to you, the problem with passphrases that you pick yourself is that they don't have any provable level of entropy, and there are people who will try every line of every song ever written to break into wallets.

Coinbase has multiple areas of potential vulnerability that you would not have.
First, they are a single incorporated entity, subject to anti-money laundering, and other financial laws some of which vary from state to state.  A temporary restraining order on Coinbase could affect many customers not directly related to an open investigation.  A money laundering charge might cripple or bankrupt them.  A sudden change in the market might leave them without operating capital.  A hacker might subvert their payment system, or their accounting system through their public web UI.
If Coinbase is still around in ten years, or if they begin offering deposit insurance, and they have developed a reputation for strong security, and there is some reason to leave bitcoins on deposit in lieu of safeguarding them oneself, then I might keep some at Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-08-26 03:22:24
Coinbase's 1% markup above spot is pretty low; and well below the daily volatility of the currency.  
The Coinbase business model is to avoid any and all risks on their part and essentially loan you the money to buy bitcoins at a stated price until your ACH completes.  Your bitcoins are deposited into your account at the purchase price in effect when you initiated the request, but it will take a week or so for the transfer to complete and the coins to be deposited.  
Also in rare cases they will be unable to buy your bitcoins at the price they quoted you.  In that case your funds will be returned, but they don't take a loss to get you the bitcoins if they can't buy them at the anticipated rate.
For a purchase of at least several thousand dollars it could be less expensive to transfer cash by international wire to one of the exchanges and buy bitcoins yourself.  That would also give you more flexibility in the kind of buy and sell orders you could enter, but wire transfer fees can be pretty high for international account transfers.

Q5.  Bitcoin decreases friction in international transactions, and lowers the cost of sending currency for online business transactions.  It can also decrease the cost exchanging money for in person transactions but is not currently very well suited to those.
Economies that are experiencing sudden inflation may be stabilized for individuals doing business in Bitcoin.  Economies that are subject to partial embargoes, especially where the embargo is primarily monetary, or where the state currencies are exchanged at legislated rates that do not match their actual value, will have an easier time doing business with Bitcoin.

... And you haven't even touched on the most unfriendly features of Bitcoin yet.   
But Bitcoin is still in its beta development phase.  The current pricing is speculative and is based largely on what it will be, not what it is right now.   As Bitcoin goes through its 0.9 release toward 1.0, which I predict will happen in about a year, the current speculative investment will turn into the currency pool that we draw upon to make it live up to its potential.
If you are just a consumer you are probably looking at it before it is ready for you.   If you are interested in crypto currency for what it can do for your business or for internet commerce in general then now is a cheaper time to buy in and get the base of coins from which your business will operate in the future than a year from now.
That said there are some groups of consumers that are already using Bitcoin in regular commerce, but they value the structural philosophy underlying Bitcoin more than the average person, and are willing to put up with the current difficulties in order to bring those philosophies into their purchases.

Adding a fee to your transaction ensures that it will be taken up by the miners and added to the block chain quickly.  Free transactions will be added when there is space available on the blockchain and when the miner isn't short of memory and doesn't already have a couple of hundred free transactions that need to be added.  (Mining pools need to pay individual miners for their contributions to the pool, so that can absorb a lot of the empty space in a block.)
There are points at which you must include a fee in order to add a transaction, and those are outlined in the protocol.   They relate to the age of the bitcoin inputs, the size of the transaction in bytes, and the value of the transaction in bitcoin.   Your client should let you know when there is a mandatory fee.
Smaller bitcoin transactions have lower priority, so are more likely to need a fee to be included.   Very small bitcoin transactions cannot be included without a fee.

Bitcoin is a beta quality product.  I believe it holds immense promise, but for someone who isn't an enthusiast, the market as a whole may just be too immature right now for you to get value from it.
Buying and selling Bitcoin has gone from really shaky to mostly kind of reliable over the last year.  Services like Bitpay have allowed an array of new merchants to start accepting Bitcoin.  But it still is missing a lot of ease of use and security relies on the user far more than you may be comfortable with.
Eventually I believe that Bitcoin will simply be another payment system; one that reaches markets that credit cards can't.   And you will use Bitcoin because you want to buy something that isn't available any other way, or because the fraud prevention program at Visa has proactively cancelled your card for you for the third time this year and you haven't yet gotten a replacement in the mail.

In addition to the previous comments, I'd add that it is free primarily for first world citizens, in as much as any costs associated with bitcoin are subsumed in the services you already take for granted.  You need a computer, a bit of electricity, an internet connection, some bandwidth (about 7GB for a full client), and enough free time to do a bit of reading about how the security model works and form a plan so that you don't lose your bitcoins due to excessive security measures, or have them stolen due to excessive naiveté.

If you are currently in possession of some mining hardware that is never going to show a return on investment then it is easy to become disappointed.   I don't think that Satoshi ever envisioned a situation where investment in mining equipment would get a year ahead of initial returns, which makes it hard to invest rationally.
As recently as April difficulty was staying mostly flat.   As recently as July difficulty still appeared to be increasing linearly.  
The problem is that if Satoshi had allowed blocks to be generated by a fixed amount of processing power, then instead of difficulty growing exponentially it would be the rate of inflation that would be growing exponentially.   And hyper-inflation isn't exactly a useful feature for a currency.

On the contrary, companies like Bitpay represent a large part of the core value of Bitcoin, in particular its negotiability.  It is because people are building applications like this that Bitcoin has the value that it does.
Or perhaps you believe that every alt-coin should be valued the same?
Perhaps you need to stop worrying about what you think bitcoin is, and look at what it really is.  If you think that there isn't enough differentiation between the bitcoin ecosystem and existing payment systems then fine, you don't have to use it.  I for one am quite impressed with the level of infrastructure that has been created in the last four years.   So laugh away if you are so inclined, I know I do, just not ironically.

Chains don't fail by their strongest link.  Thieves are smarter than you give them credit for.  Rather than brute forcing a key that will take more than the heat death of the universe to crack, a thief will take shortcuts, like disassembling your OS and every program you run to look for flaws.  Indeed it would be a better strategy, and a lot less work, to break into every house in the world and search it for paper wallets than to brute force private ECC keys.
When private keys fail it isn't by brute forcing, it is by attacking the method by which they are stored.  Easy to remember brain wallets are easy to brute force because they look like a famous quote from a movie, or like a popular saying, possibly misspelled, and so on.

Yeah, thus my question.  Since Bitcoin has no earnings it isn't possible to calculate a P-E ratio, so calculating Market Cap is meaningless.  Actually it would be meaningless anyway because P-E is only useful for comparing stocks within an industry, but that is a moot point.
But calculating the number of actively traded bitcoins over the course of a year would size the market as a whole year over year.  Market cap can't do that effectively.  
If you were create a billion Whatzits and I give you one dollar in exchange for a Whatzit, and that is all you sell in your first year, you haven't instantly created a billion dollar economy.  You've created a one dollar economy with a billion dollars in unknown limbo.
The bitcoin days destroyed metric does a pretty good job of measuring the rate at which Bitcoin's unknown limbo is being leaked into the active economy, but doesn't do much to describe how much value the market as a whole contains.

It isn't complex.  The crypto function that is being solved is simply a proof that you together with the rest of the computers on the network all spent about 10 minutes trying to solve it.  Because it takes an exhaustive search to locate the solution from the entire solution space, the work involved can't be shortcut, thus no one person or even group of people can mislead everyone about which transactions are valid and which are invalid.
It ensures that we all have the same history.

If you look back at the inputs, those appear to be lagging as well.  To me it looks like they are trying to spend outputs before the transactions have confirmed, but since they trust themselves they can go ahead on the assumption that the input is valid.  But if any of the transactions in the chain gets lost then the whole chain has to wait for the 24hr timeout before it can be cancelled and retried.
What they should be doing is collecting funds for a set of transfers into a common account and then split into multiple outputs in a single transaction instead of trying to create a separate transaction for each destination.  Or else they need to maintain a super-reserve to increase liquidity of the bitcoins they are holding.

The bitcoin network is open so there is nothing to hack into per se -- anyone can participate.   If a large percentage of the peer to peer network were bad actors they could attack the network by selectively forwarding only some of the transactions they see and purposely ignoring others, and that could be a problem under certain circumstances.  
But they can't forge signatures using private keys that they don't have access to, so bitcoin balances would still be safe, they'd just be hard to spend reliably, and the attack wouldn't really benefit anyone for the most part.
Hacking into an individual computer that is part of the network could result in stolen bitcoins provided that the computer that is hacked actually has access to some coins.  The prudent way to protect yourself from this is to move bitcoins that you won't be needing any time soon to offline storage, such as a paper wallet, or an offline wallet application such as Armory's offline transaction signing mode.   The latter approach is used by large organizations like Coinbase.

Coinbase supports directly importating paper wallet keys, so assuming that you have split your paper wallets into amounts that you trust Coinbase to hold they can be pretty quickly converted into cash that way.

Yeah, I read it when it was first posted.  The problem is that the expose, such as it is, isn't very interesting.  Basically every complaint turns out to be either Bitcoin isn't yet widely adopted or that Bitcoin is designed to increase in value as the market expands instead of printing more coins to keep the value flat.
The argument about fungibility doesn't really make sense.  If people are using Bitcoin to buy products on Amazon then they presumably will have to buy bitcoins to make those purchases, thus putting cash into the system at about the same rate that it is being depleted.  The market just wouldn't run very long if the only input was cash already in existence in the market, and there is no reason for a company like Amazon which itself run on USD to keep funds for more than a couple of minutes in bitcoins.
The reason that Amazon would adopt bitcoin would be to reduce fraud, settlement time, and fees (at least among a class of users), not IMHO to speculate on the value of bitcoin increasing over time.

I suspect that using individual transactions made it easier to link the transactions to Coinbase's representation of a customer ledger, but that is pure supposition.
Confirmation of transactions is done by bitcoin miners.  You can set up your own bitcoin mining equipment, but the common set of rules that all miners live by dictates that the difficulty of mining increases in proportion as the gross capability of miners working on the problem increases.
So, while you could help confirm transactions, that wouldn't make them complete any faster, it would just make it harder for other miners to confirm transactions (by a trivial amount unless you have many millions of dollars to throw at it).
To make the problem easier would require a change to the agreed protocol, which would in turn require all miners (and all clients) to agree to the reduction.

To my mind Bitcoin holds promise as a lingua franca of currency exchange.  Right now the USD acts in this capacity, but transfer of dollars is expensive, highly regulated, and slow.
Bitcoin is cheap, doesn't respect national boundaries, and is fast.
What it is missing right now is value.  The total value traded on all bitcoin exchanges combined wouldn't pay for a one day chip fabrication order.  (Well maybe it would some days, but if so only recently.)  It would however easily pay expenses for a reporter in the Phillipines, say, to be hired on a temporary basis to report on local conditions.
As the currency is used and speculated on more cash will move through it, which in turn will make it more valued, more speculated upon, and more useful for transferring value.   I see that as a self-feeding system, which will eventually grow to be significant on the world stage.  We'll see if I'm right about that as time goes on.

Here are a few types of taxes that I can't imagine being impacted by Bitcoin:
1. Property tax.  Why?  You still own property, it has a value, you owe tax, and the government will still put liens on your property if you fail to pay them.
2. Income tax.  Why?  You still have a job.  Your employer isn't a scofflaw, so they report your income.  Your government still has the ability to compare the taxable income you report with the income that your employer reports and will still be able to throw you in jail for tax evasion if you fail to pay them what you owe.
3. Sales tax.  Why?  The businesses that you buy goods from are not scofflaws and report their sales to the government and collect and pay sales taxes for you regardless of the payment method you choose.
4. Gasoline tax.  Why?  This is just a special case of sales taxes.
5. Auto registration taxes.  Luxury goods taxes.  Why?  These work the same way as property taxes.
6. Social security taxes.  Why?  These work the same way as income taxes.

If Bitcoin were really worth $4 then people wouldn't be willing to sell goods and services at the current $120 valuation.   Bitcoin pricing isn't a controlled market; anyone who holds bitcoins and believes that they are overpriced can sell them, and no one else can stop them.   Anyone who believes they are overpriced and who isn't holding them can refuse to buy in at the current price and instead conduct business using other currencies that are more readily available.  
On the other hand there is a lot of price speculation in the market.  Because the value of a bitcoin grows as the size of the total market grows, many people are hanging on to bitcoins on the expectation of future value, and this makes the gross value of all bitcoins in existence larger than the gross size of the market.

Bitcoins always have to be owned by someone, so they can't just go nowhere when not in use.

I'm not arguing that ASICMiner would work against their own interests (for example by blowing past 50% of the network mining capacity), but there are a number of more subtle attacks on the network that would be more in their favor.  
Miners have the option of ignoring any transactions they don't want to include in a block, so a miner with enough clout can slow the movement of balances in and out of certain accounts giving a competitive advantage to some participants over others.  Miners with a lot of capacity can temporarily slow the production of new blocks distorting the statistics that Bitcoin uses to set the new difficulty levels.  A set of miners with a net capacity over 50% of the network could form a consortium and agree to ignore blocks calculated by anyone outside their consensus effectively blocking smaller competitors from the market.  A large miner could be subjected to governmental or personal intimidation and required to vet accounts against a governmental do-not-fly list.  
The opportunities for suborning centralized systems is endless, and whether you believe the intentions of the organization are noble or not is really immaterial if that weakness can be exploited by someone for whom it is in their best interest, and who has the physical ability to make it happen.

Back in early April I was looking around for some nice mining equipment and found the Butterfly Labs web site which was offering devices for about $50/GH.  "Wow, good deal!" I thought.  "At that speed the device will pay for itself in two weeks."
So I ordered one.
It is now almost September, the hashing rate on the network has grown from 140TH to a little over 500TH.   My estimate, based on Butterfly's web site was that in the worst case the device would be delivered in two months, and that the rate of increase in hashing would remain at about 30TH per week.
Those weren't even close to worst case guesses.  
It turns out that 30TH per week was the rate that ASIC miner was adding hashing power to the network.  Once Butterfly really got going the rate was more like 100TH per week, and being far back in line my device is still well back from the front of the order queue.
Gambling is when you stand a reasonable chance of winning.  In this case everyone in the world who has enough cash in their pockets to buy in also thinks they can win, but the actual payout will be split among all of us so the actual return on investment is going to be small to non-existent.

Security in the context of crypto currencies means that there is a considerable weight of hashing calculation behind your transaction, so much so that abandoning that set of calculations to another set would be computationally infeasible.

There are so many misunderstandings inherent in this thread that it is hard to know where to start trying to explain.
First, any individual miner has less than a one in a million chance of being able to confirm a specific transaction regardless of how kind he or she might be.  Every miner in the world competes to find the next block in the chain and only one will succeed, so appealing to a friendly miner is almost pointless.
Second, once a transaction has been confirmed into one block it is never really looked at again by the miners.  Multiple confirmations just mean that your transaction has moved down a couple of layers from the top of the tree making it progressively less likely that your transaction (along with every other transaction in the affected blocks) will be abandoned in favor of a different set of transactions.  The bitcoin client always chooses the longest set of valid blocks when deciding what constitutes the real tree, so a transaction with two confirmations would have to be superceded by someone with the ability to write out a least three new blocks to the tree before the network as a whole can produce one block, which is a staggeringly unlikely proposition.   
Third, the required transfer fees depend on several factors including the size of the message that encodes the transaction, the age of the bitcoin balances being transferred and the size of the bitcoin transaction.  For a transfer in excess of about half a bitcoin the minimum transaction fee will often be zero.  Most clients (and I presume blockchain.info is included here) automatically calculate the minimum transaction fee required and you would have to go to some effort to override that.

The only physical 'wallet' with any degree of security are Casascius coins and even those I would be wary of if you are getting them from someone you don't trust.
The only reason they are trustable is because Casascius hasn't ripped anyone off yet and they have a miniscule bit of tamper resistance.  It would be trivial for any of the paper wallet formats for the person sending them to you to keep a backup copy of the keys.
So regardless of the form that you receive your bitcoins in, your first step before turning over cash has to be to initiate the transfer to a wallet that you control yourself.  
Note that even Casascius coins have been demonstrated to have defeatable security with a little solvent and a couple of minutes of uninterrupted access.   
The cheapest and most secure way to invest in bitcoin would be IMHO to choose a reliable service (Coinbase comes to mind in the US), and buy there.

The central problem of micropayments is in handling billions of transactions per day at as nearly zero transaction cost as possible.  In doing so payments must necessarily be accumulated off block-chain and then reconciled at some point with other providers.  I think that bitcoin would provide a plausible method of clearing balance adjustments across micropayments providers, but it cannot in itself host micropayments in bulk due to the unrealistic volume that would dump into the block-chain.
The main competition for micropayments would be ad generated revenue which is already essentially a micropayment system, though one in which the payment is made by the advertiser, not by the reader.   To outcompete web ads there would have to be some advantage to this new micropayment system that satisfies both a consumer need as well as a web site owner need.

Every sell has a set of standing orders, called bids, against which it is fulfilled.  Likewise every buy is fulfilled against standing orders called offers. 
Sure, someone ends up with the BTC that were sold, but the difference is that the sell moves prices down through the bid list lowering the price, while buys move the prices up through the offer list raising the price.
By the way, the current drop in price is probably good news assuming it comes from MtGox.  If people are selling Bitcoin heavily on MtGox then that likely means that they are betting that MtGox will resume USD withdrawals tomorrow as promised, and want to take advantage of the MtGox price advantage over the other exchanges before it disappears.

The Jalapeno mines at about 8GH/s.
Lets compare that with computer mining.  If you have a high end graphics card of the Radeon line you might be able to mine at about 250MH/s, or about 1/32 of my Jalapeno.  (There are a few cards that will do more than 250MH/s, but they are rare outside the mining community, so I think this is an upper limit for most home users.  A more likely scenario would have each computer producing about 40MH/s)
Using that information you can estimate that this week you might be able to mine about $0.90 in bitcoin mining 24x7.
When someone tells you that it isn't worth it to do mining what they mean is that running your rig all out for a week will use about $5 in electricity, so your net income will be about -$4.10.  If you had taken the same $5 and put it into bitcoin you would end up with more bitcoins at the end of the week than by mining.
Next week the mining difficulty will go up by about 30% making your ability to profit decline by about $0.30, give or take, depending on the value of bitcoin at the end of next week.

Bitstamp also requires ID before bitcoin withdrawal (or any other kind of withdrawal or deposit)

Mostly they don't start with much liquidity, but develop it over time as a result of earned trust.

I specifically omitted embargoed goods from my list.  There are many goods that while not embargoed are simply impossible to pay for due to restrictions on money movement.  But regardless of whether I or USGov approves, the djinni is well out of the bottle at this point.
See for example:

I just buy a couple of hundred dollars worth of bitcoin on Coinbase to spend as pocket change.
Recent purchases:  A gyft card for Whole Foods (I left my wallet at home that day and was hungry), and a game credit code for the Ouya (my credit cards were all canceled over the Holiday after the Target SNAFU.  Replacements are yet to be mailed.)

Judges tend not to be unduly influenced by flim-flam in my experience.  If it works like money then it is money is a great way to cut through the bull-crap.

In Palo Alto I'm getting that error about 30% of the time.  Definitely unpleasant, but still functional as far as I can tell.  I don't personally trade on MtGox although I have an account there.
The last trade I see is about 30s old.  Where are you looking?

Probably your USD balance.  You could use it to buy BTC if you like.

IIRC the only thing closed to US users is the web site.  The gaming deposit addresses are, I believe, open to anyone.

The market is on a knife's edge trying to figure out what China is doing.  My bet is a partial rally followed by deeper drops tonight.

*How is bitcoin not a pyramid?*
Pretty simple really.  Markets are synergistic.  As goods and services are added to the ecosystem the whole really is more valuable than the sum of its parts.  
Bitcoin as a set of numbers that get traded back and forth has negligible value, but Bitcoin as a protocol that links together and creates a market for goods and services, exchanges, speculation, and incidentally has numbers that get traded back and forth to represent value transfer within that market is enormously valuable.
*Is there a concern about bitcoin on the upper echelon level?*
Bitcoin is not classist, and has no upper echelon.
*How fucking cyberpunk is bitcoin?*
Bitcoin is more fucking cyberpunk than anything else I can think of off hand.

The gross supply has a fixed upper limit although the volume of bitcoins that are actually traded is somewhat lower.  So really there is no reason to think that bitcoins would be harder to get on the whole, barring the unlikely possibility of large scale seizures.
At least initially the value of Bitcoin would drop as buyers started withdrawing from the market, and new buyers failed to materialize to take advantage of the now lower prices.  
Where prohibited by law, being harder to get would make the prices in those countries rise above the publicly traded rate, but that would not be likely to make up the loss in value due to decreased participation and penetration even in those countries.
At the same time the legitimate businesses surrounding bitcoin would close, decreasing the market size, and with it the real value of the currency.
Within a year or so the price would stabilize based on the remaining economy, which would consist of black market goods in prohibited countries, as well as any legit businesses in unaffected countries that manage to weather the price instability.
How noticeable that will be will depend on how large a slice of the overall bitcoin market is destroyed by the newly enacted laws.

The reason that people say you should move all of your bitcoin off of a paper wallet and never use it again is because it is no longer as secure as it was when it was paper only.
There is no more risk to using a paper wallet key on blockchain.info than leaving any balance at any online account, which in the case of blockchain, which seems pretty well managed, is small.
So, what are you trying to accomplish with this process? 
If it is just to transfer some bitcoin from a paper wallet to BTC-e then I don't really understand the point of creating new paper wallets.
Otherwise, I'd recommend holding on to your blockchain.info account information.  It isn't really advisable ever to lose track of accounts that you have used.  If you have made payment to an address in the past it is possible that you might have that address in one of your send slots and accidentally send to it again.  That is more painful if you don't have the keys to unlock the account any longer.
Your paper account key can be imported into most wallets, not just online wallets, and not just blockchain.info, so if the balance on your paper wallet is large you might want to consider importing to an offline wallet like Armory instead, and signing transactions offline then moving them by sneakernet to the online system.   For more usual amounts I would probably import the paper wallet into a local wallet such as Bitcoin-qt instead of using a web wallet, but then I rarely use blockchain wallets at all.
