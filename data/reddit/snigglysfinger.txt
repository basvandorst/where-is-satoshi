That is where we are. Besides...it would be odd to drag a 7000lb. trailer on vacation. 904 is our home.

A more appropriate word would be 'self interest'.  The word 'greed' has been hijacked by a social movement that does not hold the concept of a free economic system as a value.  It has twisted the concept of free economics to mean something bad and immoral by adding 'greed' to the manner in which the subject is debated. I will say however, that I will accept your statement because I fully understand it and all it implies.

Thanks lclc

Each person that engages in commerce is free to use whatever value system they deem important (to them) to make their decision. Having said that, I use other additional factors to hire people.

You make a good case.  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:06:40
I will consider that advice.  Thanks.

I wonder how many times this guys has cried like a baby on his knees, or asked a catholic priest..."WHY!?"....or looked up at the stars and cursed them like they all just called his mom all the bad names.  How many times has he wished he could give that pizza back?  Just wow......

If your statement, given the framework, can be true.....then the converse can be true. What then? Let me say this a different way. The risk is the same between the two parties.

If someone were to call me and ask if I took DogeCoin I would take it.  I considered putting the Doge logo on the trailer but decided against it for clutter reasons.

Hi everyone!  I am the owner of the company to which that trailer belongs.  We lettered it about 2 months ago in an attempt to capture whatever portion of the Jax market might exist (in the bitcoin ecosystem.)  We get a LOT of people asking some of the craziest questions.  Everyone is curious about it.  No business transactions just yet but we are dedicated to it.  Those logo's aren't coming off!  And a big thanks to the guy that snapped that photo.  I've received some correspondence from him that might help me further develop this effort.

Littlejohnnyjewel's concern is an unnecessary mental effort.  I don't mean that as an insult.  We quote in US Dollars and accept the BTC decimal equivalent of that amount.  We do use Coinbase.  Once we receive that portion of a bitcoin or several bitcoin (depending on the scope of work)  it's up to us what we do with it.  Whether or not it goes up or down in value is not material to the transaction at the moment the transaction takes place.  It's also worth mentioning that even in the case of fungible fiat money, US dollars in this case, the 'property' of fluctuating value (which occurs in a different manner but still occurs) still applies, even though it is not considered at the moment any given transaction takes place.
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:22:09
We quote equivalency in US dollars.  Consequently the expressed value in decimal format can change depending on the then current value of BTC.  There have been times where I've spent more time than necessary just simply educating someone on what Bitcoin is....and what it is not.  Can't get to technical most of the time.  You would not believe the number of people that have a hard time conceptualizing things that fall outside their zone of experience.  It's laughable sometimes.

Our wallet address is not on the trailer.
