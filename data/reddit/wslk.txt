Nobody academically benefits, that is to say - it is not as though some organization is cleverly using the combined computing power of the network to solve math problems that are to this day unanswered. The network benefits insofar as the more mining participants that exist, the more improbable it is that the network would be susceptible to a [51% attack]( &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;
The assertion that mining involves "solving complex math problems" is a bit of a hand wave that black-boxes (obfuscates) the mining procedure. The problem being solved is in fact always [the same problem]( which has many acceptable solutions. This problem hinges on how encryption works. SHA2 encryption is a one way function that can take an arbitrary amount of input data and spit out a fixed length encryption of that data (we call this data a hash). The output looks something like this: 
60446632D493AF087A10DB85B57702122A01EC2E4D1536406F7E72C6EA87B2F2 &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;
The problem is simply a search for a hash that has a special quality. For bitcoin, this quality is the number of 0's that are at the beginning of the hash. &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;
The encryption is very easy perform in the forward direction. The SHA2 encryption method (as with any other good method of encryption) has a quality called [avalanching]( this means that inputs with only slight differences result in outputs that look nothing alike. This makes it so that whenever I run an encryption method on a unique set of information I will get a hash response that I cannot predict. In order to give miners as many tries as they want to solve this problem, there is a special field in a block that may be altered (called a nonce), choosing a new nonce makes the data of a block unique again, therefore I will get a new hash response when I put it through my encryption method. So, the process of trying to solve this problem is as follows: &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;
**1).** Take a chunk of transactions write my name at the bottom (my pubic key) &amp;nbsp;  
**2).** Pick a random nonce, place this in the chunk &amp;nbsp;  
**3).** Encrypt this information using the SHA2 encryption method &amp;nbsp;  
**4).** Check my fixed length response for the number of 0's that the network is requesting.&amp;nbsp;  
**5).** If I have found an acceptable answer to the problem, I can let the network know. This results in me collecting the mining reward and publishing the next block in the blockchain. If I did not find the answer I repeat steps 2-4. This continues until someone finds and broadcasts and acceptable answer. &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;
This problem, while it may seem vapid, is actually very clever for a couple for reasons. First, it is very easy for anyone to 'check-my-work' since they can simply put the unique input data that I claim gives an acceptable answer through the SHA2 encryption method and observe the desirable quality of the response for themselves. Second, the problem is constructed in a way such that it is very easy to make exponentially harder, or easier. I can simply request more or fewer 0's. Each additional 0 I ask for will increase the difficulty by a factor of 16 (since the hash represented in base-16). The bitcoin network evaluates how quickly these problems are being solved, and picks a difficulty in order to regulate the rate at which solutions are found by the combined efforts of the network. The difficulty seeks to hold the average time required by all participants at 10 minutes. The network protocol reevaluates the number of 0's a correct answer requires every 2 weeks. &amp;nbsp;
Apologies on the long-winded answer, but I think it is necessary to truly understand this topic. &amp;nbsp;
**TLDR:** &amp;nbsp;
Who determines what problems they are solving? - The network determines the problem, and its difficulty, to make it so solutions are found at regular intervals. &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;
Who stands to benefit from them?  Academically - Nobody. Miners get bitcoin reward as a financial benefit. Users get added confidence in the integrity of Bitcoins blockchain as more miners join in and the problem becomes harder - this is because  a 51% attack becomes less reasonable. &amp;nbsp;  
Additionally miners receiving the rewards are incentivized to be virtuous actors as they themselves are being paid in bitcoin, so it would be detrimental to them to threaten its stability.
