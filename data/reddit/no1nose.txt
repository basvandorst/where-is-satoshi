Thank you. Can someone point me to a walk-through for Node Activation? I have the required ports forwarded through my router. I saw several commands for registration on the Bitnode page ( but I am not sure where to run them from. Can my node be activated from my Windows 7 workstation, or do I need Linux?

How difficult will it be to install a larger SD card to accommodate a larger blockchain? The Bitcoin Core client on my PC is near 30 GB now. As transactions increase in frequency I expect we will outgrow the 64 GB card that is included in the near(ish) future.

I think we will see a rise in BTC during the election and it might stay up for a while afterwards until people start collecting their profits.

They certainly picked a good day to sell.

Holy crap, I was upset when they lost a $10 transfer of mine.
