Alright.  
Without even going into the details of why this just won't work, let's look at it from a very basic numbers standpoint.
Scotland has a population if just over 5 million people.
Just over 13 million Bitcoins have been mined.
OK, even if all of the coins were available to the people that still works out to only around $1,000 USD per person anyway.  Now, we know that all of the coins aren't available, so that number is considerably less.  The numbers simply aren't there.   None of this is even touching on the other painfully obvious reasons why this wouldn't work.

What the fuck are you tallking about?  He is the one that said he would only donate if they accept Bitcoin.  I don't donate based on whatever technology I am trying to pump, I have morals.  Get your head out of your ass.  
@_date: 2014-12-29 12:28:03
That's some doublespeak shit if I've ever heard it.
If you use a service like Coinbase they are reporting everything, including where those coins have gone.  I've also never had my Visa statement available for public scrutiny, how about Bitcoin though?
If the general public can sort through my purchases with Bitcoin, what is stopping all of those scary organizations that you just mentioned?
@_date: 2014-12-29 12:43:22
Wow, seriously?
Anyone that knows your Bitcoin wallet address also knows your purchase history.  Sure, you can do things to make that less of an issue, but that really hurts the whole ready for prime time argument.
I want to start an "Outed by Bitcoin" website.
@_date: 2014-12-29 12:58:06
Don't you realize that it's not really the idea of sorting through a random address that could be generated and ignored as much as it is blocking your entire history from being viewed though skimming someones common address?  The kind of stuff that regular people use.
Please don't mention off chain crap or tumblers or anything here.  I am talking about someone having an address with some money, buying things, and having it remain public.  Unless you are someone that doesn't value privacy at all, or you are someone that is completely familiar with the steps that need to be taken to launder money, your shit is completely public.
Seriously, just give an honest answer.
@_date: 2014-12-29 12:20:47
Wait... someone fucking scammed Bitcoin enthusiasts?  Someone please comfort me and tell me that my investment isn't worthless now.
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:37:26
I asked you how the numbers would work out when they simply aren't there.  
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:21:47
What is your point then?  It's douchey to not donate just because a place won't accept something with a value that fluctuates 30% or so in a matter of days.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:10:13
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:20:07
Hey, I thought you ancap twats were all about donations?  Not all of us are selfish ponzi fiends.
@_date: 2014-10-19 22:40:18
I've donated a double digit percentage of my income according to my last tax return.  That was in fiat though, I didn't make people take my donations in the form of Beanie Babies then stomp my feet and refuse to donate if they wouldn't.   That seems like something a dick would do.
@_date: 2014-08-20 02:13:33
You're pissing people off!  Right now one of those captains of industry is looking at this post and before they know it their slightly soiled purchase is lying on the desk to free up a hand to downvote you.  It's fine though, because they can now say that they have dropped panties with their love of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:06:34
The donation was dependent on them accepting Bitcoin or not.  He is a dick.  He should feel alienated.
@_date: 2014-09-06 22:28:08
First, I am not the one downvoting you, I would legitimately like to hear an answer to this.  I am familiar with Bitcoin, and I am familiar with people avoiding these questions like this.  It's almost like it's not something that was really thought through.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:52:02
Please, tell me.
@_date: 2014-12-29 12:31:38
Uh, most of those entities would have to be aware.
Pease refer to one of my other posts regarding Bitcoin privacy.
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:32:54
I need think I need some explosives and a bulldozer to cut through this irony.

I'm interested in the blockchain that could be built off that beard.
@_date: 2014-12-29 13:11:09
You've gone back to full mode.  I'm not trying to be difficult, I would really like to see some honest answers.
All of these fancy wallets and things that you mention are things that really shouldn't be needed to use Bitcoin.  If my mother decided to use Bitcoin, should she get some third party wallet?  Should she stay connected to the internet?  Would her coins be safe?  
You guys keep looking at it through the glasses of a meh level programmer, you don't actually try to process it working in the general public.
@_date: 2014-12-29 12:16:03
They mentioned anonymity as one of the key points.  I can purchase whatever the fuck I want with a credit card and nobody else knows.  If I did the same with Bitcoin there would be a trail of things linked to me for who knows how long?
@_date: 2014-09-06 22:16:26
Please explain.
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:00:35
Do you feel better now?  Listen to yourself.  YOU FUCKING TAKE MY BITCOIN AND YOU LIKE IT!  That sounds kinda rapey, no wonder you guys can't get mass adoption.  Can you use Bitcoin donations as a tax write off?
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:30:06
That's actually not what it says at all.  
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:00:00
Let's not talk about hypotheticals here when you are suggesting that a country uses Bitcoin as its currency.  Please actually answer the question.
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:22:45
You are fucking delusional, I guess that's the Bitcoin way.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:06:12
Did you not read the post at all???  The person said they won't donate unless the organization accepts Bitcoin.  How else do you spin that?
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:59:25
Moving the goalposts.  The Bitcoin way.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:31:08
Keep dreaming, maybe you will find that moon some day.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:42:21
You're joking right?  They have enough cash to buy all of the Bitcoins, all of the mining farms, and ASIC companies combined.  They could destroy it if they wanted to.
@_date: 2014-10-20 01:41:34
It's not any more complicated than an individual holding a potential donation hostage because the charity doesn't want funbux.  Try to spin it any way you want, but that's not me being evil or hateful.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:43:03
We aren't talking about the market as it is right now, we are talking about the market with Apple as a player with billions to throw around at it.  I'm sorry that you can't see outside of your narrow view.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:13:58
Apple buys enough mining gear to 51% the network.  
Price crashes, people unload their coins cheap.  Of course they wouldn't do this, but they totally could.
Apple says that they will buy Bitcoins for $500, TONS of people would sell them millions of coins.  They own the market then.   If people try to bring the price up, Apple dumps a a portion of their coins back on the market at $200, tanking the price again.   They could straight up own the market.  Just think about it a little bit.  They have the money to own Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:25:01
Even if the hodlers were holding out for a silly high price Apple could destroy the market making their coins worthless anyway.  The point is that Apple could steamroll Bitcoin if they wanted to.  This isn't even debatable yet you guys try.
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:32:00
I'm being downvoted on I've never felt more validation in my life.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:17:20
You understand what was implied by saying "buying all", no need to be pedantic.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:09:52
Buying then selling at the volume Apple could afford to would have a huge impact on the price.  Don't kid yourself.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:28:00
This is some scammy shit, don't click it.
Free tip for you Bitcoin guys, I don't want to see you all get totally wrecked right now.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:31:46
So a "USD bubble can't keep going" but you were unable to see a problem with $1100 Bitcoins?  Maybe your judgement just sucks.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:00:58
It dropped like $100 in the last 24 hours, how can you honestly tell someone to buy right now and not think of yourself as a total piece of crap?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:41:57
Give me a few minutes before we continue this conversation, I'd like to put some hip waders on if I am going be knee-deep in shit like this.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:13:57
I never called you a name.  If you feel that you fit the bill that's on you.
Seriously though, up $100 in 24 hours.  Not happening homie.  Not to mention, why would you encourage someone to hop into something with such extremely volatile nature at this very moment unless you have something to gain from new blood in the mix?
@_date: 2015-01-03 09:35:00
This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-18 10:12:03
Such as?
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:37:42
Don't talk to me about being a decent human being when you are defending a person that is encouraging another person to buy into something that lost $110 ($262 to $152 on Bitstamp) at one point in the last 24 hours.  Don't even try.  That's not decent advice.  That is scummy and self serving.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:07:56
Get over yourself.
Yes, buying Bitcoin today is a bad idea.  Yes, you might be a piece of crap if you try to encourage someone to do that.  That's not name calling, it's just not acting like a faux nice guy while trying to peddle something that will make you profit.  Some of you guys are so far back up the other side in this that you can't see how ridiculous you look to the non-belivers.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:08:39
I remember people shitting themselves over Tickle Me Elmo too, I don't see that making a grand return though.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:52:52
If they bought millions of Bitcoins they could also dump millions of Bitcoins and manipulate it down without much more cost.  Your lack of perspective on this isn't surprising.  Apple could steamroll Bitcoin.

Yep, this is Bitcoin 101, get yours... fuck others.
@_date: 2015-05-30 05:32:18
His $159 billion Bitcoin is worthless though if the rest of them have tanked.  If Apple put even a tiny amount of money into ASIC they could 51% the network in no time killing it entirely.  It's frustrating because you guys seem to just look at one tiny sliver of the overall picture.
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:06:55
They could throw away billions in Bitcoin too, you guys seem to only see one part of it.   
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:57:32
Thank you for highlighting the lack of understanding among your peers.  I am not saying that they will dump that much in, not at all.  That would be the single dumbest business decision in history.  I am saying that they have the money to do whatever they would want with Bitcoin.  It's simply the truth.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:41:14
Please elaborate, I can't wait to hear this.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:22:01
 Apple has $159 billion on hand.  Are you guys REALLY saying that that couldn't buy Bitcoin with a current market cap of $3.3 billion?  REALLY?  With a straight face?

It's the pseudo–intellectual shit post.


Are you an alien?
Why would your handwriting tip me off?  I have no idea what it looks like and I didn't search your history either.  I am not interested in doxxing like Bitcoiners, and I don't need to pick apart what you have said in the past either to laugh about your losses.
@_date: 2015-04-07 05:13:03
Cool, I just looked it up, I am nowhere near there but it looks like a nice  place.

Legit question, are you under 20?
@_date: 2015-04-07 04:46:54
This is even more of that kind of out there talk though.  What you are saying is NOT what will grow Bitcoin or help it gain mainstream traction, and that is a lot of what is behind Nobody is demonizing anyone for wanting it to gain value, it's the people that want to hold onto it like Gollum and the ring.  It's not even about selling either, it's about USING it.  People don't use it, Bitcoin enthusiasts don't use it... either because they don't want to lose their ride to the moon by parting with them, or they don't want to lose more money by exchanging them for goods or services well under the value of what they paid.  This is just reality.
@_date: 2015-04-07 05:40:32
Blame someone else, OK.  Obviously this isn't about it's use as a currency for you, it's a way to get rich.  This is exactly what I am trying to say.  Thank you for so clearly making an example of my point.
Aside from people using it and creating a practical application for it, what is going to drive the price up?  Is it just going to do it on it's own?  Why on earth would the average Joe becoming involved with Bitcoin at this point?  What can it HONESTLY offer them?  Maybe if it had some incentives in the marketplace because of an active base of consumers there could be some programs or benefits to draw people in, but none of that is taking place because you guys aren't spending them.
If you guys aren't spending them, and businesses aren't taking them, and people don't have any reason to get involved, why do you really think the price will go up other than being used as a get rich gamble?
@_date: 2015-04-07 03:13:33
You guys just don't get it though.  I really thought crypto was pretty cool at the start, but it's different now.  It's not an experiment or people using it to buy things and just do stuff against the grain.  It's just a bunch of people that want to horde it now because they think they can get rich from it, or they don't want to have losses because they have bought into the idea of holding come hell or high water.  They bought at silly high prices and they feel that they really haven't lost if they don't cash out!
There isn't a post explicitly saying that every day, you know this, but you don't care.  By him not being able to post exactly what you want it gives you an out, a way to write him off without having to face the facts.  Should he keep pumping blindly?  Will that help?  
How about that bar in Manhattan that made front page here yesterday, none of you guys gave a flying fuck about it UNTIL the Bitcoin ATM was gone, then someone went on the Yelp page and made a comment about them not being Bitcoin friendly.  The fucking place had an ATM and tried it out!  Not friendly?  Shit, they would have been better off not even touching it, it always comes with this fanatical baggage.  The person making the comment was never even in the bar but they felt the need to shit on the page over the thousands of other bars in NYC that never even tried BTC to begin with.
Try to think about it all for just a minute, you guys create your own problems.
@_date: 2015-03-16 05:06:45
This is good for Bit-Coin.
@_date: 2015-03-24 11:12:39
Oh come on, this is just being a little baby.  Options like bank draft and paying by check as well as Amazon payment are all on that other payments page.  The only payments on the primary donation page are the most common, debit/CC and PayPal.  Why in the world would Bitcoin be added to that page as well before the other options?  It's obvious what the real motive is here.
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:03:42
Wait, isn't "fuck you got mine" the official Bitcoin motto?
