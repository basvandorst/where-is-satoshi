So you post the text of the whitepaper with BTC knowing this coin is not what you signed up for. Fast, electronic peer to peer cash doesnt sound like BTC to me.

Without memes sure not

Okay so even without 2 coins, you got banks controlling the LN. We'll see how future goes my friend.
Bch has got 8mb blocks which can scale up to 32mb. So i guess for a long time there wont be problems with tx fees and times. 
Have fun with your 1mb blocks and blockstream and the lightning network :)

So on one hand I have BTC which needs the LN and LTC for cheap and fast transactions and on the other i got BCH which needs none of them.

Okay but why use 2 coins+ LN when BCH solves it all.

Thats a nice idea I think I'm gonna go with this for some months now. Thanks!

Okay so what do you think about blockchain or which wallet would you recommend for me?
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:35:03
Got an s6 edge plus but how does that affect that? I'm willing to spend about 3k Euros.

Yea sure you just create an acc on bittrex.
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:51:45
How about private persons?

If I were you I would take like 10k and put in on bittrex. Then learn trading and reading the candles. When you feel safe trading -&gt; go in with bigger amounts.
ICO's are great aswell though its high risk high reward.

It's not really a gamble when you know what youre doing. Also I dont go all in.

Paper wallet - free, can't get damaged if you care
E wallet- costs, possibility of hardware defects exist

Altcoins are raising due to more and more fiat pairs exchanges offer. Altcoin summer we are coming :)
