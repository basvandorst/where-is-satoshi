Total drives = x
missing drives = m (m&gt;1 where i assume mt gox issue is) 
if you have the data on x-m drives doesn't that reduce the problems space of brute forcing the private keys many many orders? probably to the point that its possible on modern equipment?

I agree with many of your points, though I do think you are using many assumptions from your time on wall street that you must reevaluate when addressing a value system like bitcoin. 
The most important distinction I would point you towards regards: 
"Each of the top 50 private equity firms in world has raised enough money RECENTLY to buy the entire currency outright." 
If you fully engage in the thought experiment of how exactly an entity for whom 8B is a pittance would go about 'buying the entire currency outright' you will find after many attempts thats it would be implausible, arguably impossible.  _Most_ bitcoin are simply not for sale anywhere near current prices, many are not for sale in dollars, and many cannot be seized or acquired through _any_ means. 
If someone where to assign enough value to the bitcoin blockchain to make a meaningfull attempt to buy even 10% of it outright, then we would be in uncharted territory for price. 
I caution you against underestimating the _truly_ fixed 'money' supply of bitcoin or the unique ownership properties that the blockchain allows. They are economic beasts that have never existed, its closest analogue is gold, and, to extend the beast metaphor, might only be killed by starvation.

Fascinating, thanks! Would you mind pointing me to some discussion of the on chain incorporation? 
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:27:58
You can burn oil for energy, inexpensively extract hydrocarbons for plastics. You are probably wearing some cotton right now. the vast majority of the economic activity to deliver those things to you was denominated it dollars. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 13:07:15
You can do those things now, they are valuable now, which is why buying them then was a good idea. It would only be rational to buy oil then if you had any reason to believe that it would have utility in the future. 
On the other hand bitcoin has an algorithmically defined purpose, to incentivize miners to secure the Bitcoin network. There are no future cases where a bitcoin does something else, because its only function is algorithmically defined. The primary difference in your analogy to Oil is that unlike oil, we know _exactly_ what a bitcoin can and can't do. Right now. There are no 'futures we don't know about' on the Bitcoin chain. There is plenty we don't know about on other chains, but not the one you are buying bitcoin on. 
Current break down of economy on the Bitcoin blockchain(the one that you own bitcoin on): 
~97% - A greater fools speculative game which has utility only to the lesser fools. In this kind of game f you don't know who the fish at the table is... you might want to sell your bitcoin.
~3% - Dark market activity that is wuickly drying up because the Bitcoin blockchain is very very public and the more visibility it gets the less utility it has.
There may be some other smaller uses that I havent mentioned.  services built on Bitcoin scripts and deployed on the blockchain you own bitcoin on, but those are damn near impossible to write anything useful with and, well, ethereum.

Thats the one. Thanks!

I'm confident that he simply forgot a 'not'
The sentence structure would make quite a bit more sense if that was the case.

fractionally reserving the dollars silly.

After looking at market caps and assets of banks, bitcoins 4B market cap looks WAY too high.

And now he works for ethereum. I wonder if he thinks they have solved the political problem.

Never mid I was mistaken about the address I was sending it too and now the transaction is there and its an address I have control over. I have deleted the post. 
thanks for taking the time. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:36:16
will do, I'll also get all my ducks in a row as far as the totals and such. 
There doesn't happen to be a way to export all transaction and details, does there? 
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:03:47
Thank for the response. What happened was: 
1. most important : i was mistaken on the destination address. 
2. transaction was rejected by breadwallet for too few peers, but would try again later. 
3. i sync breadwallet and the new synch doesn't contain the transaction because it was rejected, but had already been broadcast again by BW. 
4. the destination address did receive the btc but i didn't think it did because i was mistaken on which address i had sent it to, couldn't confirm while the transaction was missing from BW. 
5. Now the transaction is there, was in the next block and I have confirmed that the BTC went to another address I control. 
Again, thank you so much for your response. I did learn something new about how transactions are formed. :-) and its nice to know people like you are out there to help people like me. 
I have deleted the original post. 
I have also learned that deleted post can still be accessed by the people who have commented already and that new comments can be made... hidden threads within the original subreddit... cool. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:34:59
Thank you for taking the time to be concerned. 
I cannot provide the from address because the breadwallet transaction is no longer in my list of transactions. 
4-5 block have been solved since then, but I wouldn't be surprised if they haven't made it through to my devise via the breadwallet mechanism. I only have 2 peers right now. 
I'll keep syncing and trying not to be too worried about it. 
I suppose I can take all the received address from the prior transactions to find out which address has the coins. The transaction must not have ever made it to the network since the receiving address doesn't have the transaction on it. 
Can a signed transaction be intercepted by the first connection and altered? I wouldn't think so, but i also don't know exactly how that whole process works.

Vinay is an awesome guy and this is a bit of a sketchy answer, but maybe its as simple as 'they told me to sell out of egold so i wouldn't piss of the government'
