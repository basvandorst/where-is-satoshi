I cant imagine what a lightning transaction would do for his file transfer thing. Really I cant imagine what a regular transaction would do for him, but for it to do anything I think it would need to be on chain. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:09:12
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:06:34
I'm sure we can handle the transactions. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:49:25
Whatever, I am done speculating about his vaporware.

Are you sure mechanical turk people can get physical cards?

Don't fucking day trade. It's just gambling.

Amazon is paying a bunch of people in amazon credit for doing data entry and shit. They are the target market. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 22:08:29
My understanding is that a lot of people that use it don't have bank accounts. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:09:08
What market is that? 
@_date: 2015-12-30 04:24:41
Bitcoin cant change right now without core consensus do you really think a radical altcoin feature could get consensus?
@_date: 2015-12-26 01:58:17
How is bitcoin going to "take advantage" of altcoin innovation when something as simple as the blocksize is already written in stone?
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:33:44
The combination of the power that reddit gives mods and the network effect means reddit becomes shitty for a topic if the main subreddit for that topic has shitty mods. People are probably going to sites like coindesk for their bitcoin news now.

Hey Evan, I love your work. My concern isn't with the technical problems of changing the bitcoin code but the political problems with implementing that code. I imagine there would be at least as much controversy and associated unpleasantness about making bitcoin a 2 tier network as there has been about changing the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-12-30 04:18:39
Are you so sure about the adaptability and anti-fragility in the light of the current blocksize debacle? 
@_date: 2015-12-30 04:21:41
Do you really think the core scaling roadmap is compatible with network effects accruing solely to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:13:12
lukejr is literally in favor of decreasing the blocksize. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 03:36:26
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:34:36
Is that even right? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:40:38
Also how can BU be responsible for preventing replay attacks and not core? They seem to be asking for BU to actually create an altcoin and not a bitcoin fork. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 04:03:47
Welcome to the new bitcoin. It is not meant for use by the average person but as a settlement network for companies. You may resume using bitcoins for convenient person to person transactions when Blockstream gets the Lightning Network going. 
Sorry for the inconvenience. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:17:49
You are being scammed. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:15:58
I am so grateful to them for dramatically changing what I thought bitcoin was going to be without consulting the community at all.

There's a 600 petahash miner being constructed in the Republic of Georgia. If this is that going online then we actually just moved the majority of the hash power out of china.

I am 100% ok with Roger taking Satoshi's role.  
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:24:44
You cant make money off of the lightning network if people can just send bitcoin transactions. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:06:01
I cant justify putting my money in anything these days. 
Stocks? We might already be in recession.
Bonds? Bond bubble.
Real estate? Previous bubble wasn't allowed to pop. 
Gold/silver? If paper you cant trust paper, if physical you cant trust whoevers holding it, if you hold it it can be stolen. 
Dollars? lol
Other fiat? see dollars. 
Bitcoin? Blocksize debacle.
Altcoins? lol
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:01:35
Sounds like you could use a [more fungible]( currency. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:15:20
How are they supporting 8mb blocks without supporting a specific implementation? Does the encoded message really just mean "8mb good" without endorsing a specific BIP or whatever? Whats the fucking point in that case? 
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:17:11
Probably working on a business model that makes sense.

Sorry, pointing out the obvious is the best I can do.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:42:32
And nothing of value was lost. 
Edit: Sure, downvote me. They are attempting to destroy bitcoin whether through malice or stupidity we would be better off without them.
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:27:19
GET OUT OF THE WAY
@_date: 2015-08-16 05:06:04
Why is it that massive douches out of touch with the community always end up as mods?
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:03:54
Fuck the mods.

@_date: 2015-08-05 23:06:11
Eh, I think it would require calculus to make a decent guess and I forgot how to calculus.
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:13:06
So the miners are actually supporting BIP101?
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:26:32
Can someone tell me anything useful about[ identifying bitcoin as being in a bubble](
