Maybe I am reading this wrong, but is the price supposed to be [16 BTC per shirt?]( Must be some nice quality...

Gonna ask the obvious and assume you didn't sign into your YouTube account to view the video? If you did it would be in your video history.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:04:25
Lol shit, must be nice.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:42:21
Well then I would quite enjoy for this this frequent occurrence to occur to me.

Like OP said, I am not 100% sure if they allow US residents to join (I thought I saw something saying they do however) . I would probably just go through the signup process and if US residents are not allowed to join I am sure you'll be able to tell pretty fast (no state fields, zip codes, etc). Could always message support? They're pretty quick to reply.
Edit: Did some digging and spoke to someone at VoS,  they said this:

Any tips I receive typically go right back out, spread the love :p
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:30:33
I think that one dude popped a blood vessel.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:12:31
I think we're all in the same boat lol. I bought .15btc (or so) at $700, I don't think I'll be purchasing any more until at least SOME sort of correction happens. Just hoping it doesn't fall far below that $700 mark, but who knows at this point. I'll just continue to ride the roller coaster with everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:55:34
This tipping system makes my day, I think this would be a great idea to get some more interest going. I got sent $0.25 worth of BTC a little while back and I felt like a kid on Christmas. Hopefully I'll have enough coins soon so I can help spread the love!
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:32:34
I was actually going to start with Virtex but the fact that I don't have a debit card with any major institution (I'm with a credit union) made it really difficult to get funds into my account, actually caused me to hold off on buying BTC for a few weeks (which I of course fully regret now lol). 
I stumbled upon VoS in [this]( thread and decided to give them a shot. The fast approval was a good start, then I went to BMO and sent US funds directly into their account (actually asked the clerk uhh, is that it? Thought it would take more work, easy as making a normal deposit), then within an hour the funds showed up in my account. So far I'm really happy with them, fee's are pretty reasonable too. Rumour has it they're looking to implement new deposit/withdraw features (like debit transactions), hopefully that happens soon!
Good luck with your trades!

OP has a serious vendetta for litecoin.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:16:08
I think this guy might be lying.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:51:27
This is a question that can only be answered by you, start reading and decide for yourself.
PS: You're more then likely going to find plenty of positives in subreddits dedicated to Bitcoins specifically, just remember to keep an open mind when reading.

Dude, you have to login and shit. What is this, the 90's?
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:39:23
I have done it twice now (I am not with BMO) and it was super easy. Walked in, gave them US funds and a print out of VoS deposit info, was done in 2 minutes, just as easy as a normal deposit. Actually asked the clerk uhhh, is that it? haha
One tip I received from them is to help speed up the process (if you can), make your deposit end in an odd number (helps narrow which payment goes where) and when you email them to let you know you've made a deposit, attach a picture/scan of your bank receipt.
Good luck!

I have implemented [these coin widgets]( on [my site]( and it actually works/looks pretty slick!

I appreciate it, thank you! :)

Is that VoS? I got approved by them almost instantly (under an hour).
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:31:58
If only little 8 year old Kendrick actually existed, this would be quite amusing.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:42:40
Wow, this guy. Good guy vbuterin.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:46:33
I've had nothing but success with them so far. Lot's of other people on Reddit are using VoS as well, plenty of [posts about them]( if you want to read up.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:12:58
Something tells me they thing they're getting 1 BTC, not .1
Still though, jesus...
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:17:31
**PLEASE** get some more sellers in there.

[$20]( is expensive?
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:30:50
I just heard about  Fee structure seems very fair and they can accept cash deposits (go to BMO, get them to send $x.xx cash to xxxx account and you're done).
[This]( is the thread that pointed me to them.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:13:17
Kinda sounds like they are just doing this to get user information...
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:26:51
[Gooood, gooood.](

I would be okay with that warning...

And the oncoming car is the "PANIC SELL?" thought.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:28:50
Yup that's exactly where I am at, wish I could say I know for a fact it will rise, but I certainly have faith that it will. Even if it drops to $500 I won't be getting rid of my coins, if I am taking a loss I'll be taking a loss of 100% lol, riding it out to the end!
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:35:06
Absolutely positive that it is possible it may or may not.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:01:37
The general rule of thumb around these parts is don't panic sell. Seems like you learned the hard way.
Hopefully you didn't sell at a loss to boot, riggghttt?
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:46:24
I am 100% positive it is possible that it may or may not stop at around 800 btce.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:03:18
I'll bite! This looks like it will be much easier to get funds into my account. I have been having problems doing this because I'm with a credit union and not a major bank. The fee's are much more reasonable as well. 
Thanks for the post OP!
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:27:16
I had some USD laying around so it wasn't an issue for me, but yeah it does kind of suck. They are supposedly adding CDN within 1 to 2 weeks however.

Usually asking for tips/donations doesn't get perceived so well on Reddit as a whole, it especially doesn't get perceived well when its the the 2nd rule on the sidebar.

CoinURL pays for impressions when using their interstitial advertising (ads that overlay on the site, user must wait a few seconds, then click skip to view page) and pays per click when using their banner advertising. From what I have heard unless you have a lot of users clicking your ads, the banner ads tend to be less profitable then the interstitial ads, however the interstitial ads are much more annoying to your users.
I have personally been using [anonymous ads]( (ref link) and it seems to be going well so far. They pay for impressions and clicks which is nice. Ads seem to be pretty normal (not super flashy/annoying). With 72 impressions and 3 clicks I have made 0.00013817 ($0.11), which isn't much but I have only just stated running these ads a few hours ago.
At this point I am still experimenting and trying to find the best BTC ad network, let me know if you come across anything. Good luck! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:19:04
But Newtons law does not apply to bitcoins...
lol seriously though, I hope you are right so I can get in on a few more!
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:13:28
So... I should, orr?
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:47:15
The worst? Your £10 becomes worth £0 because Bitcoin crashes and no one wants to buy it. Probability of that happening? At this point, fairly slim.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:55:30
I am absolutely positive that it is possible this man may or may not actually be able to predict the future.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:36:18
I'm with VoS and have had no issues as of yet, support is excellent and they seem to be a stand up business. If you're unconftorable I always recommend doing some research before hand. A fair amount of other users on Reddit are satisfied with them as well.
It is a bit unfortunate what you have to do to get coins at this point but it may change in the future. Options are limited so if you wanna play you gotta decide whether you think it's a worth the "risk".
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:51:33
I am absolutely positive that it is possible people may or may not actually be able to predict the future and perhaps know what they might be talking about.
