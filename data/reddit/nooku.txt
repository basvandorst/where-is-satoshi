No, BTCs can never disappear.
They are either going to be sent, be stuck in limbo which is always only temporary, or stay in your wallet.
I don't know the technicals on what you can do to cancel the transaction.
But they are never going to just disappear so don't worry about that.

Patenting technology which was created, or came forward out of the ideas of other people, is just plain "stealing" in my book...
So if every developer just ignores the patenting ever happened, maybe we can get society / politics / justice so far to just ditch this whole patenting bullshit.
Banks patenting blockchain technology is harmful to society since it can stop these technologies from flourishing, which costs society. And banks profit from it.
We started Bitcoin and the entire block chain technology to get rid of banks, 
NOT for letting them to become even stronger.
I see banks patenting block chain technology as nothing less than a declaration of war.

That's disgusting. Some things in the system are really broken.
Cars could only have been invented because everyone was free to use the Wheel. Everything that's being created, comes forward out of the ideas of others. Ideas should always be free accessible and usable for everyone.
That's really too bad for companies, but companies ain't people, and companies aren't there for the people but only for their self-interest. 
If patents and copyrights wouldn't exist, yes, that would be bummer for the current companies. But if the rules are the same for everyone else, then people will keep inventing, more than ever before. Knowingly that ideas get copied and reused. That's a shift of mind everyone must make. 
We are a society, we are on this earth together and we should share ideas instead of hold onto them as our babies. 
And do that in the knowledge that our ideas that we supposedly made up by ourselves, were actually spawned and molded by the ideas we received from everyone else. We just bring the ideas together in our minds and make something new out of it.
We shouldn't be so selfish about our personal ideas, but instead, we should give our new and fresh ideas back to society, for free, as a sign of thankfulness to all the people who gave us the info we needed to create that idea in the first place.
It's a different way of thinking, maybe a different way of running a society, but it isn't new. It's the way the world worked for the past 100 000 years, it's only since the 1850's that patents and copyrights were invented. The world thrived on the free flow of ideas. 
We should get back to that way of thinking, instead of shooting each other in the back for some fucking green useless dollars.

Just wait until it falls down to $200.
But that won't happen so you'll buy it at $900 after it first reached $1100 
Oh no, you actually won't buy at $900 because at that point you think it's in freefall.
Your actual buying point will be somewhere around $3500 after having reached $5000 - then dropped down to $2000 and than up again to that $3500. Because that's the point you are panicking because you missed the boat.
So, until then, just keep passively following it.

Bitcoin hasn't caused this misery. Bitcoin is just an alternative that was created because this kind of shit was expected to happen, and will continue to happen.
Events like these, just reconfirm the need for something like Bitcoin. Something that exists next to the "regular" financial sector.

It's worth noting that this ad overstates Bitcoin's advantages over Western Union. It's true that you can transfer funds from one Bitcoin user to another with very low fees. However, for the system to be useful to ordinary people, there needs to be some way to convert from conventional currencies to Bitcoin, and back again. Right now, the fees for this kind of service often makes Bitcoin-based money transfers as expensive as — and more cumbersome than — Western Union.

Why are you laughing at the statement that the dollar is going to reach zero sometime in the future?
The US Dollar was created in 1786, meaning it only survived a mere 228 years. 
Claiming that it will reach 0, is the same as saying that the 228 years is not a period long enough to show that the dollar will keep existing forever. Which is a perfectly reasonable claim to make.
But you laughing at it, assumes that you are a person who believes it will not reach 0, which is the same as saying that 228 years ago, humanity came up with a currency which will be proven to be THE currency that would stay in existence till the very end of the human era.
Wait, you seriously believe that? And you are laughing at others? 
Economists and all of their theories only work when everything stays the way it is. They've been educated to know everything about the current system. But as soon the current economic system either collapses or transforms in extreme ways, all of those theories they learned in school are thrown out of the window. And they'll know shit.
What strikes me the most about Economists, is that they all seem to have their strong opinions on deflationary currencies, saying "it can never work". They are right, in school they are taught that deflationary currency can never work **in the current system**. What they are forgetting is that a deflationary currency leads to an entire different system, which will turn out to work just as good within its own laws and boundaries. And economists can't seem to grasp that since they have learned **what** but haven't learned **why** (with the smarter economist, who actually has the ability to think it through, being the exception, of course).

We need Satoshi Dice to "break" the Bitcoin system so we and the developers are all forced to change and build Bitcoin in such a way that it can withstand such a usage.
This is so important to avoid any bigger problems in the future.

It's even better: 
* The donation process is more personal since a small message can easily be added to the tip, 
* everyone can see that YOU tipped someone (some people do care about that), 
* no changes on websites are required to provide an extra spot for a Bitcoin address,
*  the system isn't limited to articles but you can tip just any type of content: YouTube videos, tweets, music, ...

Without going too deep into the subject, I'm just going to say this:
The current economic system only exists for about 100 - 150 years.
All the textbooks / educations about economy are based on this single type of economic system.
A deflationary economy has never been able to exist since it required something that was truly deflationary. 
Bitcoin is the first practical currency in human history that is 100 % deflationary and transparent as such, because we have designed it that way.
Saying that it wouldn't work is just a wild guess and fear for the unknown, since it is new and untried territory.
There are very good arguments out there which state that a deflationary currency is actually better for the durability of goods and services:
A deflationary currency promotes hoarding and being picky on what to buy (so quality starts to matter a lot), 
while an inflationary currency promotes spending and produces tons of waste because companies are rewarded for making products that are **not** durable.
Mother Earth wants us to build durable products.
A currency which gains value overtime can become the solution to that since it will make us punish companies that produce trash. Who would want to spend his valuable coins on trash that breaks in a year when another company offers solid material that's proven to last 10 years and longer?
Lay your textbooks down next to you and come out of your comfort zone. Start thinking out of the box, so we can build a better society.
We must keep evolving.

Companies are having privileges that real human beings of flesh and blood don't have.
That's the first issue that needs solving, if we want to bring some humanity back into the system.
Companies can send one of their employees ( = CEO ) tax-free on a vacation, while a poor person has to pay the full price. Just one example of one of the biggest flaws in the current system which creates and increases the gap between the poor and the rich.

Bitcoin provides a service.
The service is transferring value around the globe in seconds / minutes without any significant costs.
This service is worth value.
That is what gives Bitcoin value.
Additionally, you'll need Bitcoins to use this service, but these coins are scarce and everyone who wants to use the service that Bitcoin provides, needs the coins, so it creates demand.
The more people that want to use Bitcoin, the more value each Bitcoin or part of a Bitcoin has.
The value is related to the amount of people using it. The more people use it, the lower the average amount of Bitcoins per user will be.

Bitcoin gains value overtime, so it's fuel for a sustaining environment and it also equalizes the world money supply. It redistributes wealth all around the world and gives poor people access to money who do not have access to dollars / bank accounts.
So before you "blame" commies for being "anti-bitcoin", I just want to tell you you'r just full of shit.

For me,
all I see is a dude saying he closes his Coinbase account, I'd have to guess why, my best guess would be because he no longer wants to have any Bitcoins... 
I don't understand why nobody is asking questions, everyone here seems to know what it's about but the comments aren't really useful to explain it though.

@_date: 2014-10-26 13:55:56
I don't know why but the documentary / trailer never picked up any pace with the public.
When you look at the votes on youtube, it's almost 100 % positive but the views themselves stay very much down.
A few months ago, I've posted about this documentary before and it never picked up any upvotes on Reddit either, no negative comments or anything.... but just no upvotes, just that.
I don't know why that is. It looks pretty promising to me. Maybe it's just because it's in a non-English language. English is not my main language so for me just about anything is in foreign languages ( including English ) so I'm used to that.
But it seems that English-speaking people are turned away from non-English / foreign language films and documentaries?
Just a guess though.
But the fact they wrote the crowd funding page solely in Hebrew wasn't very smart marketing either, no English version was available. I don't know what their plans are now.

Your comment about the medicines is a valid argument. 
But I see it as a real issue that we need to solve as a society. A lot of people won't like hearing this, but, we should not solely depend on profit-driven companies for the development of medicine.
What we as a society need to build, is a global research system, paid by all the countries in the world, which is not profit driven but result driven ( allowed to make losses ), and who's goal is to invent medicines that the world need. Then they need to be distributed freely among the world citizens who need it. Basically a system by the people, for the people.
Of course, such a system would be a nightmare for pharmaceutical companies who will see their profits and power dwindle as a result. 
But we must figure out how we can move forward as a world society as a whole, instead of wondering how to keep private companies alive. In the end, they are "just" companies: lifeless, artificial entities.
Then we move the discussion to the capitalistic system itself, which has a variety of supporters and opponents in the world and it's for a lot of people a very emotional or selfish-oriented debate.
I can only hope that we will never forget to keep in mind that the goal must be to create a better society and that a company must always be seen as just a tool to reach a goal. Not a goal itself, as was originally intended back in the 1800's when the first company was founded.

I actually think that "charging customers less for using bitcoin" won't do much.
Despite that it's slightly cheaper, it still gives people the option to chose between spending deflationary Bitcoins (which in theory gain value in a months time) vs spending inflationary Dollars (which in theory lose value in a months time).
Customers could choose for paying with Bitcoin for a short-term gain, but it keeps their Dollar-wallet more full while dollars should be spend asap. 
So I would still want to get rid of my Dollars faster than my Bitcoins, due to the inflationary vs deflationary argument, despite the small % that its cheaper.

Thanks, interesting links. I'm pro copying too.
Thanks to copying things during the past thousands of years, we have evolved to what we have today.
Our brains have evolved into copy-hungry meat and it's a trait that separates us from chimpanzees.
It's only recently, with the invention of copyrights and capitalism, that we have become such a selfish beings.
That's not our legacy.
As a programmer I'm guilty as well. I personally don't like to give away my code for free. But I'm aware that it's a result of how I was brought up, as well as the fact that it's a (required?) mechanism for survival in a capitalistic society. If I would be giving everything away for free, I'll have no food on my table since the butcher probably won't be that noble (well, you can't copy a cow anyway though).

Better durability doesn't automatically mean higher costs. You can have materials that are of equal cost where companies are simply choosing the less-durable route so the product will wear out within the foreseeable future.
The argument that more durable products will always be more expensive doesn't hold.
Companies simply won't make products that are 100 % more durable and 1000 % times more expensive.
Instead, they will be pursuited to find the sweet spot where products are 100 % more durable and *less than* 100 % times more expensive.
And that's the thing those Bitcoin-consumers will then reward.

Call me old fashioned, but I believe bits should be the smallest possible amount, just as it has always been in computer science, which would then be 0.00000001
And Satoshis should be 1.00 bits, to have an equivalent notation as $1.00 and €1.00 so you would write [S]1.00
That would be the most logical but who am I.... I was brought up with just the metric system.

What are sidechains?
From how I understand it, they are the only way to prevent Bitcoin from collapsing under its own weight due to the blockchain size that will grow exponentially during mass adoption and misuse.
Sidechains would take this weight off of the main blockchain.
Sidechains will be connected to the main blockchain through tokens and carry the weight of the petabytes of data.
The Bitcoin currency itself and its transactions will stay on the main blockchain.

I just wanted to make clear that, when we would have the right incentives, we can have the required technology, knowledge and resources to solve the issues mentioned.
So it's "politics" in general. I (mis)use or abuse the world "politics" for any type of politics, as for example company politics which are dictated "profit motivation".
Banks, who basically rule the world of financial transactions, have chosen fiat currency &amp; the FED as "the best system there is" and won't steer away from that by themselves.
Now that the power is in the hands of the people, through the networks I mentioned, people can organize and make up their own politics, creating the required incentives to actually have the development of a payment protocol, like Bitcoin. It's the people, mainly programmers, but also small businesses, libertarians, who not only have the need of a payment protocol, but also the required technology and the programmers ( = the open source community ).
Of course, it's also general technological evolution that's important as well. The combination of these things, is why we are seeing something like Bitcoin only today and not earlier ( like in the 80's for example).
I hope that clears up what I was trying to share.

I know that there are a lot of skeptics who might think it sounds "too good to be true" but there is actually a very logical explanation why this works.
* the persons at Bitcoin builder are buying MtGox BTCs at a discount ( they pay 1 BTC to get more than 2 times that amount of BTCs in their MtGox accounts ). These kind of people are thinking that MtGox will stay alive, and seeing a nice opportunity on doubling up their BTC stacks.
* The BTC price at Gox is crashing because the clients don't trust Gox and think the BTCs there are worthless, resulting in a price that's 1 / 5th of that on other exchanges.
* This combination of factors, means that people with $$ in their accounts, are the ones who can profit from this. 
That's all there is to it.

Just look at the current hottest topic here:
*"Contact Senator Coburn and tell him you want to bid in the US Marshalls Bitcoin Auction, but need clarification whether Bitcoins are 'illegal' as Ken Hess has concluded from his statement. If he replies they are 'not illegal', Ken Hess is finished. It's time we stand up to corrupt journalism. (coburn.senate.gov)"*

50 % of the world's wealth is in the hands of 10 million people.
These 1.4 % are more criminal and more unethical than hackers. We can also assume that these people have an intelligence that's just average. It doesn't take intelligence to get that rich: you just need to get born in the right family, with the right connections.
Now, compare this to the 1.4 % of Bitcoin, and yes, let's assume that these are mainly hackers. In order to be a hacker, you have to be an excellent programmer. This requires intelligence: The 1.4 % of Bitcoin is in general more intelligent than the 1.4 % of the Dollar Economy.
Also, consider this:
The 1.4 % in the dollar economy has no interest in spending their money: they get all their possessions from "living in the dark", meaning, if they buy a house or a car, it gets leased by the company they own, they'll pay 0 taxes. They will never touch their personal credit cards: they'll always have some "special black company card" that buys them anything they want, tax-free. They will never pump any of their money back into the economy, that's how they get to keep their wealth and even increase it.
Comparing this to the 1.4 % of the Bitcoin economy: these people are using their skills, not only to hack, but also to build something that's productive for the Bitcoin economy. They spend their coins on products they like, without the shady company schemes that the dollar economy uses. They exploit weaknesses of the Bitcoin economy and sooner or later show to the world what those weaknesses are, so they can and will be fixed.
**tl;dr** the Bitcoin Economy Top 1 % consists of an entirely different type of people than the Dollar Economy Top 1 %. And please trust me on this: The Dollar top 1 % will always be more powerful and more criminal than the Bitcoin top 1 % will ever be.
The dollar top 1 % are the ones who can actively change laws at will, denying democracy. While the Bitcoin top 1 % are merely technically savvy intelligent geeks, who I believe will actually do something productive with their stolen coins.
EDIT: Oh, and, the dollar 1 % has the additional advantage of printing money and making sure that more than 50 % of that newly printed money gets distributed to themselves, to only pump the rest back into the economy, increasing their lead of wealth in the process. **Not gonna happen with Bitcoin.**

It can't be applied to super market chains,
but it can be applied to a software developer for example, who provides his services solely in Bitcoin, given he has enough projects to choose from, prioritizing all the paid-in-Bitcoin orders.
Product-related merchants could for example prioritize all the queue-ing orders of rare-availability products to Bitcoin-buyers above dollar-buyers, or for example: 
"Pay in Bitcoin and you receive your product in 3 business days. Pay in Dollars and receive your product in 5 business days."

Your comment, and all the upvotes you are getting makes me wonder why nobody seems to be taking the time to actually read what I'm saying.
Every single Bitcoin faucet out there, is in fact a centralized system distributing a decentralized currency.
Every single Bitcoin user is a centralized person, trading his decentralized currency.
So what's your point?
The government would be doing nothing more, and nothing less, nothing else, than simply mining Bitcoins and getting their coins in a normal way, just like every other miner does.
The **only** difference being that this miner is owned by the public community (=government) and the coins are distributed evenly to the members of this community (=citizens).
The government is the only entity maintaining the database of which human beings are its citizens and which are not. Thus they are the only ones to check which citizen has received his monthly free Bitcoin income, and which citizen has not. That is why I brought up the government. There is currently no more reliable way to distribute coins in an honest way across the citizens. All of the other ways, are more prone to double-giving.
I **am** thinking, but are you with your circle-jerking one-liner?

Capitalism is all about consumers, people must consume as much as possible.
Bitcoin rewards hoarding instead of consuming.
The consumer has to become smarter and more picky, capitalists hate that.
Companies are actually going to have to do their best in a Bitcoin world to convince consumers to buy their crap, because Bitcoins are valuable and the consumer won't just trade their coins for anything.

I saw this coming.
People told me a few months ago that the owner is neglecting this exchange since the time he became a millionaire and no longer cares much about taking it serious nor taking his clients serious.
*"all bitcoin not withdrawn will be destroyed"*
This attitude and his actions fit right in his mindset. He's blatantly going to steal all those coins and he isn't even trying to do it covertly, instead he's going to put the blame on the customers in the form of "Didn't you read the statement / warning? That's your own fault. We destroyed the wallets." 
Yeah sure, "destroy".
A few months ago, I've withdrawn all of my coins there and stopped using the exchange indefinitely since I knew he no longer could be trusted.
I advice you all to stay away from mcxNOW, withdraw your coins NOW. 
He knows at least ~25 % of the people with sleeping accounts will have missed the notice and won't have withdrawn their coins in time and he's going to rake in all of them for his early Christmas.
And he believes he's going to get away with it ( and probably will so ), that's an arrogant self-confident millionaire right there.
I wouldn't be surprised that this is just his endgame and mcxNOW is never going to come back online at all since he's probably tired of running the exchange. Any decent software programmer would have a mirrored development environment and doesn't need any of this "off line for maintenance".
@_date: 2014-10-26 09:22:25
Ok, I'm no expert.
But I do know how to read an orderbook and looking at the bottom of the ask-side as you are doing doesn't say anything: Nobody would ever pay 14 % per day to loan some Bitcoins.
It's just the same as anyone can put up 1 BTC for sale at $ 1 million anytime they want, and you will see it showing up in the orderbook but that doesn't mean the value of a Bitcoin suddenly increases to $ 1 million.
Also, the bid side is important as well and there is almost no demand for Bitcoins, and the demand that is there is at a maximum of 0.1799 % which is nowhere near the 14 % 
Correct me if I'm wrong, again, I'm no expert, but this screenshot doesn't say anything.

I believe it depends from country to country.
In Belgium for example, we have a very solid healthcare system etc.... which is saving us tons of money compared to the US system where insurance companies are sucking peoples pockets dry.
So I'm fairly OK with paying taxes here. If I go to the dentist, it's free. If I need to get hospitalized, it's free.
If I have to go to university, my total cost is just $1000 per year... and so on.
Our taxes are fairly high, but it doesn't make us poor in any way.

In order to go short, you need people lending you coins.
Mine can't be lend out to shorters, since they are stuck in cold storage.
Only a small amount of the Bitcoins in circulations can be (ab)used by shorters.
And what happens when they have all been lend out to this very wealthy shorting entity?
Then there is no more supply to meet the demand, and price will skyrocket again.

Bitcoin has mining, yes, but it's temporary and not lasting.
If we compare the current rate of mining versus the rate of adaptability, we can conclude it has an overall deflationary effect already at this point in time.
Gold has never been deflationary, there has always been popping up more and more gold in the past ( dug up ). And even if it would've been deflationary occasionally (locally, like, in a town before we had any big transportation), it's never going to make it as a digital currency that can be transacted globally, while that's exactly what we are looking for in the digital age.

It doesn't exist where I live ( Europe ) and we've got one of the best education systems in the world. Here, it only takes a vacation job of 1 month to pay for an entire YEAR of college.
No seriously, what's wrong with you people. How do you even consider it to be normal?!?
We may speak the same language and like the same stuff, but apart from that, our society thinks and is very different. Corporates and money are running the US, not its citizens. All for profit. Nothing less. Nothing more. 
Having debts is just like slavery. It's financial slavery. 
The difference between financial slavery and Egyptian slavery is this: 
the slavemasters provided free food and free housing to the slaves, in exchange for the work. 
Americans however, get money to pay for the debts they need to make to be "free".

A bit is, just like in computer science, the smallest possible number, so 0.00000001 BTC
Then the term Satoshi was introduced to make it look more like other currencies and so 100 bits is written down as 1.00 Satoshi, equivalent to the writing of 1.00 dollar and 1.00 euro.
So a Satoshi is 0.00000100 BTC

Everyone who sells their GOX BTCs at the current rate of 112,50 USD/BTC
Because they could get 0.371 real BTC for each GOX BTC and a real BTC is worth $571 ( Bitstamp ). So that's 0.371 x $571 = $211.841 through Bitcoin Builder
So again, it are the sellers at MtGox, who are selling at $ 112.50 who are basically throwing away their money to everyone who would follow the above steps. 
They are selling something for $112.50 that's worth $211.841

I saw this coming.
It came to me a few months ago that the owner is neglecting this exchange since the time he became a millionaire and no longer cares much about taking it serious nor taking his clients serious.
*"all bitcoin not withdrawn will be destroyed"*
This attitude (and soon that action) fits right in his mindset. He's blatantly going to steal all those coins and he isn't even trying to do it covertly, instead he's going to put the blame on the customers in the form of "Didn't you read the statement / warning? That's your own fault. We destroyed the wallets." 
Yeah sure, "destroy".
A few months ago, I've withdrawn all of my coins there and stopped using the exchange indefinitely since I knew he no longer could be trusted.
I advice you all to stay away from mcxNOW, withdraw your coins NOW. 
He knows at least ~25 % of the people with sleeping accounts will miss the notice and won't withdraw their coins in time and he's going to rake in all of them for his early Christmas.
And he believes he's going to get away with it ( and probably will so ), that's an arrogant self-confident millionaire right there.
I wouldn't be surprised that this is just his endgame and mcxNOW is never going to come back online after the 15th since he's probably tired of running the exchange. Any decent software programmer would have a mirrored development environment and doesn't need any of this "off line for maintenance".

There is no need for Ruble / Bitcoin conversion.
I mean, an apple product could be sold in a Russian store priced in Bitcoin (at USD rates....).
Then it completely dodges the Ruble volatility, since the Bitcoin / Ruble price would then take care of the volatility through the exchanges instead of through the Apple store.

Bitcoin is a technology, a computer network.
The Internet wouldn't have gotten a black eye in the 90's if people would've been sending letters to postal offices saying "internet is going to put you out of business hahaha"
Neither will it have much effect on Bitcoin.
We are not selling a product here. We are not a company trying to sell something.
We are just fans of a technology, because of the technology itself. 
These jokes are only affecting the uninformed who are always behind anyway, and will follow the crowd eventually.

[A week ago, I saw traffic increasing on Google Trends](
Today it's happening on And in the near future you'll see it happening in the price.
In that order:
1) a person googles Bitcoin for starting points ( last week )
2) Uses the found websites to gather information ( this week )
3) Buys coins and price increases ( near future )
4) Media sees price increasing and increases their article output on the subject ( right after near future )
1bis) people read it, and start googling it ( minuter later than right after near future )
2bis) .....
And then a new feedback loop will have started, till at least the end of the year. 
Such a loop has just started, the signs are there.

Aren't the predictors of 1929 pretty much dead in the current era?
I mean, ideally speaking they should've been about 20 years of age when  making the predictions in 1928 so they were born in 1908.
That means those predictors are currently 107 years old. 
I wouldn't call them the most reliable source at that age, if they exist at all.

2014 - 4 - 4 = 2006
Make sum of the numbers from 2 0 0 6 , that gives you 8
Now substract 8 from 2006 and you get 1998
Put 1998 upside down and in reverse, giving you 8661
Make sum of the numbers 8 6 6 1 ==&gt; 21
Now you get a 2 in the first position and 1 in the last position.
Now follow this pattern, by taking 8661 and substract the 2 from the first position.
Also substract the 1 from its last position.
This converts 8661 into 6660 but we all know that 0 can be removed anyway, so you get... **666**

Gold can't be used for online transactions, and that is unlikely to ever change as well.
In the past, all economy was based on face-to-face contact, so gold was useful.
Today, more and more (and in the future almost everything ) parts of the economy will be based on digital contact.
Then people will start to care less and less about gold, and since less people will be interested in owning physical gold, its price will collapse. Until it's seen as obsolete.
As a result, it will no longer be a deflationary asset. So it's very likely to change.

To all the people here who are questioning the relevance of Bitcoin vs a Mathematical Pattern course:
I'm sure this teacher knows what his class is all about and which side-quests are important or just interesting.
The posters here don't. Especially considering they've never heard of side-quests since most of them were brought up with a broken educational system.
In my educational system, our history teacher teaches us a bit about economy, maths teacher about physics, physics teacher about biology and biology teacher about math. **These side-quests are informational and are never to be graded.**
And that's why it is appropriate that teacher Jzenemig is teaching Bitcoins in his Mathematical Patterns course.
My country? Belgium, which has one of the best educational systems in the world. Just mentioning this before you start questioning my seriousness.
Courses should never be solely limited to the main subject. Because once schools start being like that, you gonna have a broken educational system, dear Americans.
I'm glad there are still teachers out there who know how to teach.

This is clear proof of how this whole mempool FUD is is false. This is clearly just one of those spam attacks again, and it shows that normal transactions will just go through.
The only transactions stuck in the mempool (and thus making the mempool increase in size) or those from attackers like these.
Actually, the increased mempool shows Bitcoin's defense system against spam in action.
Anyone trying to use this FUD for arguments for hardforks and what not, is making a mistake. Bitcoin is perfect just the way it is. A hard-fork might break things and undermines the legitimacy of Bitcoin as a currency.

Maybe this might sound childish but I'm going to post it anyway.
A few years back, all of my Bitcoins got stolen but I moved on (owner of a mining pool robbed everyone before it was public knowledge that Bitcoins aren't safe on a pool).
Fast forward to December 2013 - January 2014: MtGox.
I figured out a way, the only way, for people to get dollar funds out of MtGox. Better yet, people would not only get their dollars back but make huge profits in the process. Everyone who took my advice, was gaining 70 - 130 % on their dollars that would otherwise have stayed stuck during the MtGox shutdown.
I first figured it out and tried everything myself, then wrote a step-by-step guide, and posted it here on Reddit. At first people were skeptical but after a while people tried it out and were reporting it actually worked and as a bonus they indeed realized profits during the process.
The thing that I was gutted about, is that almost nobody ever thanked me. Nobody gave me tips or whatever. 1 guy, just 1 guy thanked me.
I wish I had people helping me when I lost all of my personal Bitcoins but that didn't happen: I lost everything.
Now I figured out a way to help others and decided to make it public, and the community just shrugged.
And then in the months after, I see people getting tips, donations, and what not, for the sometimes most meaningless comments...
I know this might sound childish but it's something I have a hard time forgetting.

You are making a mistake concerning that it shoots down the possibility of giving bonuses. Unless I'm missing something.
But bonuses are paid from the rake you are making.
So 100 % of the rake goes to the casino, and through bonuses, any % of that 100 % can be paid back to the player.
Thus bonuses are perfectly possible.

1) The difference is that the people have the free choice and option to buy a fair amount of Bitcoins.
Nobody has the free choice or option to buy a fair amount of $$ or €€
2) People with the right power have the option to create new $$ and €€
Nobody has the power that would give them the option to create new Bitcoins.
The (re)distribution has many more degrees of freedom than in the Dollar or Euro systems. The numbers you've written down is what the people have chosen it to be so far. 
People not embracing Bitcoin is people not embracing their freedom and power to redistribute the global wealth, but sticking to the old systems and powers instead. Their loss. They'll figure that out in the end.

From how I understand it, they are the only way to prevent Bitcoin from collapsing under its own weight due to the blockchain size that will grow exponentially during mass adoption and misuse.
Sidechains would take this weight off of the main blockchain.
Sidechains will be connected to the main blockchain through tokens and carry the weight of the petabytes of data.
The Bitcoin currency itself and its transactions will stay on the main blockchain.
Or am I talking complete bullshit here? ( serious question )

I can somehow live with the removal of the price prediction since I've indeed didn't give any price predictions, although it's something I genuine believe in. I also saw it more as a joke, since we are $100 up since Sunday and I like bringing some euphoria to the subreddit. That was my way of expressing myself.
But this case just reminded me again of the subject stated in my opening post, and it triggered me to post about it. I believe we must encourage democracy, freedom of speech and utilize the voting mechanism as much as possible in achieving this, and only use moderation as a last resort against cases of criminal activities and things alike.
Also, I have to say I don't believe that non-filtering would always automatically lead to uncontrolled chaos like many believe, possibly because they were told since childhood that we always need rules to avoid chaos. 
I've experienced this first hand in some kind of experiment I've participated in in the past: We had a huge community with a chatroom that had 300 people in it and a handful of moderators. We collectively decided to do absolutely nothing, no moderation whatsoever, and let people say whatever they'd like, do whatever they wanted.
The result was interesting: there was no chaos whatsoever. When someone says "fuck" to troll, and another one says "fuck", and 10 other people say "fuck" in reply, it's fun. Then, it gets boring and people stop posting "fuck". 
From that moment on, nobody is interested anymore in writing the word "fuck" for sole trolling purposes. So we managed to filter the trolls saying "fuck" out, by doing absolutely nothing. 
Since then, I always use this (somewhat simplified version since we ran that experiment for months) experience as an argument that a lot of systems that concern human interaction can be very self-regulating, if you would just give them the chance and freedom to do so ( which is exactly what we are currently doing with Bitcoin the protocol and Bitcoin the currency: we have hackers, and we have people making Bitcoin wallets more secure, all happening without laws! Bitcoin is self regulating, in trying to become safer. ).
With all that said, moderators are still very mild compared to some other subreddits that have become outright fascistic. So again, don't see it as an attack on itself.

That's all true, yes, I agree with you.
But gold will always stay just that, gold, a mining resource.
That's why Bitcoin is nicknamed the "digital gold" because digital gold can actually be transported in matter of seconds to the other side of the world.
Paper money has already been disconnected from gold in the 70's and people accepted that because of usability issues. So gold, as good as it might currently seem as a store of value, might actually not be perceived like that forever. Just like beans have had their time.

@_date: 2015-01-21 00:45:22
I didn't know the rake was 2 %
Pokerstars runs at a rake of about 4.5 %
So to compare your rake costs with a site like Pokerstars (4.5 % vs 2 %), means that at your site the players would be getting the equivalent of 44 % rakeback at Pokerstars.
Pokerstars only offers about 5 % rakeback for recreational players, and about 30 % to regular players. (70 % to the pro's but they are a minor group who scare all the others away so those can be ignored)
So 44 % "rakeback" (technically it isn't rakeback) is already a very good deal. This nullifies the need to have bonuses.
Therefore you can ignore my initial comments. Just a rake of 2 % is a good deal already as a basis, and you could / should market it like that. Bonuses aren't needed.

Are you fully aware of how the wealth is currently distributed?
The people who have the most wealth, haven't earned it. Instead they've just grabbed it by inventing the monetary system. Then manipulating it.
A redistribution of wealth means that people who truly earn it will receive it, who are now not receiving it.
The biggest growing sector in the past 30 years has been the financial sector, who have created almost no value. They have sucked up all of the earnings from the other sectors who did create value.
Redistribution means the dismantling of the financial sector and giving those earnings back to the sectors who truly earned it, the sectors that truly manufactured products and technologies which have advanced (and still are advancing) society. And giving those earnings back **to the people** who've been working in these sectors: society.
The amount of automation has never been as high as today, and yet people are forced to keep working 5 days a week to "earn" a living. That's because the wealth has been sucked up by the financial industry through shady constructions and systems that were unbeatable by the other sectors.
Bitcoin is a first step in the redistribution of the wealth.

Your best shot to gain popularity quickly, is organizing freerolls and guaranteed tournaments.
Some of the people you can attract with tournaments, will stay to fill your tables.
For example:
Post the following on Reddit: 
"There is a 1 BTC freeroll running tomorrow 9 PM."
And you get an instant hundred+ players. Some of them will stay.
Make sure you are also running Guaranteed money tournaments, they are less expensive for you than freerolls. 
The people from the freerolls (bait) will stay if the guaranteed money tournaments are interesting. The constant traffic that gets generated lets more and more people stick around because people prefer to see crowded places.
The more people that stay, the easier your cash tables get filled.

They don't consider the time value, because right now, it simply doesn't matter as much as with a deflationary currency.
I come from a country were money saving was the big thing in the 20th century.
That has changed due to the fact money keeps inflating and a culture of credit card purchases / consumption has been imported from the USA.
But those things (buying on credit / heavy consumtion ) is a direct result of the inflationary currency.
You are assuming that consuming behaviour in a world with inflationary currency will stay the same as with a deflationary currency.
You are missing the point that consumer behaviour is always **a result** of what the game mechanics really are. 
Change the rules of the system, and the way people play the system will change as well.

And the CPI's standards are the holy book of rules that defines what a good economy should look like? 
This system was man-made and defined by rules. These rules are fulfilled because that's how this system was designed. That doesn't mean anything.
It's like playing a game of Monopoly where the winner is declared because the rest is bankrupt. That's not a good economy, that's a monopoly. But that's what the game rules were designed for: to give someone a monopoly.
That doesn't mean a monopoly is good in its own although the result is good in terms of a healthy monopoly by the monopoly game rules standards.
The same goes for your "CPI's standards" that define a "good" economy.
An inflationary economy is generally a bad thing for our natural environment since it rewards mass-production at the cost of the earths resources. Think about that for a second.

This is a Reddit-level issue.
In the private message, 
* 1) click "Report", 
* 2) "Reason: Spam"
* 3) click the big REPORT button
This way it gets forwarded to the Reddit admins who can update their antispam system.
**Do not:**
- Do not click on the link the spammer providers. It redirects to innocent users of Ethereum who have written something for other Ethereum users with no intent whatsoever to have it having spammed around by another person, on other subs. 
**These users are not in any way responsible for this spam.**  Do not brigade their topics. Do not harass them in the comments.
Do not report the linked topic itself, because that in itself is not spam **and** then it also doesn't get forwarded to the Reddit admins. This type of report will only be forwarded to the Sub moderators who **can do absolutely nothing about these spammers**.
Just report the spammers themselves who have sent this private message. It's the only effective solution and they are the only one responsible.
If you are going to harass other people who have nothing to do with it, frankly you are not much of a better person than this spammer himself. Because then you've become a spammer as well.

Depends on what you see as important. The fundamentals that made Bitcoin big in my opinion, have been destroyed.
So from my perspective, I can no longer see Bitcoin growing the way I imagined it.
That's personal. But I'm not alone, there is a big group of people who think the exact same way. That are the "serious problems".
If you think they aren't problems, then for you it might still be a good technology.

I don't fully understand Bitcoin, true.
And I don't have an opinion on the blocksize debate.
But I do have an opinion on censorship and free flow of information. 
And that's exactly what this debate has turned into.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:35:33
With Bitcoin, I can write code like this (try to read and understand it):
    IF ("Lethalgeek.linkKarma &gt; 2000","onDate = 20th August 2015", "oracle=api.reddit.com")
    THEN("10.0","USD",3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy)
    ELSE("10.0", "USD", 1PtxQWVYaSuFvat23yM1owgokHSWMHKvZx);
That's something I can never do with any other money. That's a big deal. 
It are possibly only programmers who understand how big of a deal the above example is.
Does this still sound like garbage to you? 
**The above is all that you and I would need to gamble on your link karma.**
Now imagine trying to do a same kind of thing without the Bitcoin protocol... 
Without Bitcoin, the First thing you'd need is a 3rd person who acts like an escrow. We need to find him. Then we both have to trust him. If he runs away with the money, we are both scammed. If you and him run away, I'm the one that's scammed. He would want a fee for his services. 
With Bitcoin however, we just agree on the above programming code, sign it with a signature, and the bet is on.
Just imagine the possible future applications that will come out of this...

This one was accidentally pushed through the spam filter.
A mod said that ETH topics aren't allowed here, but he pushed it through because he only read the Bitcoin part of the title before realizing, and he didn't want to bother to remove it again.
I argued that it deserves its place on this sub because this is about the  (actions, thoughts, focus of) Bitcoin Venture Capitalists which matters a lot to the Bitcoin space imo.

My post wasn't really for you personally, 
but it's just some education for all of the 40 people last night who hijacked my ETH topic because some spammer linked to it.
The most ironic thing is that I've started conversations about Smart Contracts on since 2012 and it didn't draw any attention for discussions. 
Now I started a conversation about Smart Contacts in (Ethereum) and it attracted the attention of 40 Bitcoin users, but for a whole other reason.

That failed too.
The third attempt is to harm the development process by hijacking the community.

Why don't people get the choice to actually keep their money in a shoe (without losing out)?
And people who are investing in companies that produce as many consumer goods as possible, aren't doing society any favor by helping companies to destroy earth's resources for the sole sake of winning this stupid race for money.
The point is, if you work and earn money, you should get to keep that value forever. Bitcoin is one of the only few "assets" that give me that feeling that my value is somewhat safely stored.

That's.... sharing ideas.
If only more people would embrace sharing instead of trying to claim and then do only so little with the claimed idea.
Then we could've evolved far more than we have.
How many ideas have been patented and then were just put behind locked doors? Where nobody could do anything with it except the lazy inventor who doesn't really has the time to do anything with it ?

There is a new technology out there that's currently already showing more resemblance to a Bitcoin 2.0 than the current live version of Bitcoin.
And if you are doing any research, you must be knowing which one I'm referring to.
I've entered Bitcoin for the idea behind it, and for that same reason, I've already had to move away (partially) from Bitcoin because Bitcoin has left its original idea more than other technologies out there. OP's article is just one of the many symptoms of that.

I also just completed withdrawing everything after a LOT of hassle. 
For a moment, I thought I was never going to see my money back again. Needed to get outside for a moment to not faint, lol.
But I kept my cool and started to try out stuff and devised a plan to get everything away from that exchange ASAP. 
Don't know how much I lost in fees and price differences in the process but I think I've recovered about 90 % of what I had there, which is still better than nothing. The price of the coins I used for the hassle happened to rise throughout the process so that helped a bit too.
I ignored all of the warnings in the past year but now I felt it was really getting time to get the fuck out of there.
But to stay fair: They are also the one exchange that made me the most money in the past years, so it's really a shame I now felt forced to leave them.
I think they are insolvent.

In order for Bitcoin to go from no value to full value,
the Bitcoin price must go from 0 towards some big unknown number.
However, this move to full value can not happen overnight, nothing rises from 0 to full value overnight. These things take time and depend on adoption.
That's why we have gone from 0 to 1200 to 200 to .... that's the road towards full value. That's math. 
There is nothing wrong with that, you just have to accept the fact that in order to reach full value it has to go through extreme volatility: adoption grows (UP), while others dump their coins for the thousands of $$ in profits that they can cash out (DOWN).
There is no need for QE, policy, law, rules, .... All we need is time, and time is moving forward so we're cool.

**Option 1 [inconvenient]:** Wear a heart-rate monitor that keeps sending "I'm-alive"-signals to a central server. Program an API on this same server which returns a true or a false on the "Am-I-Alive API request".
**Option 2 [convenient]:** Contact the government instance that keeps the official civilian records. Ask them to implement an API on their servers that will give back a true or false on the "Am-I-Still-Alive"-request, authenticated with your username/password. 
**Finally:** Now write a Smart Contract right on the Bitcoin blockchain that uses either your own central server, or the Civilian Records API as the Oracle.
If this Oracle ( = your personal API server or the civilian record API server ) returns a false multiple times for an extended period of time ( say, 7 days, to count for network outage etc... ) the rules in the Smart Contract are met and the coins will be transferred to the wallets of your kids.

**pro-choice:** *"An embryo is basically just a bunch of cells that grows and grows and grows, but it takes a long time until consciousness arises. As long as the embryo is not an individual self-conscious human being, it's both technically and philosophically the ownership of the mother, who's carrying and growing this egg. It are her own genes that are growing into an organism. Therefore, it's her call to decide on how to proceed."*
**pro-life:** *"I don't understand anything about science but God made the heavens and the earth including this little baby, so every mother killing her unborn child is a murderer! Killing a child of Gawd!"*

I didn't want to make the text too long. But let's face it: the father didn't had to do shit. It's the female body that will grow this baby for 9 months, and 50 % of the genes are coming from this female body. The combination of these elements tips the ownership shares to the side of the mother. Especially in the 9 months before birth, where the mother is effectively building this entire baby body with her system.
The only thing the father did was giving 1 copy of 50 % of the DNA blueprint. That's not even a milligram.

The people that banks employ are people who's talents could've otherwise been used to actually create value for society.
Banks do not create any value, so each person that works as a bank is a person who isn't creating anything of value.
Those people should feel bad about themselves, for not doing anything useful with their lives. They are just going to their daily bank job for a salary and that's it.
I'd never want to become such a person.
In the last 3 decades, the most growing sector out there is the Financial sector. They've grown solely by sucking money out of all the other industries, industries who've employed people that actually created value for society. These industries gained growth by themselves and should be keeping the fruits from that. 
If society would be responsible, everyone at a bank would give up their job and all of society adopts systems like Bitcoin. But people will always be too dumb, sort-sighted or selfish to lay down all the pieces and understand the puzzle. All they care about is doing their little daily tasks in return for a salary at the end of the month.

Comparing a baby to an embryo and seeing them as equals, is the uneducated comparison.
It's like comparing a human being to 3 potaties, a bottle of ketchup and some apple juice.
Because you could make the argument that the contents of the potatoes, the ketchup and the juice are about to build a new human in the future. So throwing potatoes, ketchup and juice away is murder.
But nobody does that, do they?
It's the same thing with an embryo. But that's only something that you can learn through education. Education about biology, proteins, DNA replication, etc... All of those fields show that an embryo is **not** a human being but just a temporary stage, and as I said before, it's the mother herself who's fully responsible and has full ownership over the carrying and development of this embryo.
If the mother decides that this embryo should not evolve any further, then everyone has to respect her choice in that. It's just not someone elses choice to make. Again, only educated people can understand the reasoning behind this, because they are looking at it from a mechanical point of view: how nature works, how embryos works, what proteins are, what DNA is about. DNA is not life, DNA is just a blueprint that can lead to life depending on whether the natural environment allows it. The mother is the natural environment, and the mother can make a consious choice that is only hers to make.
People taking away that choice from a mother, are selfish short-sighted and uneducated human beings who only care about their own personal feelings about an embryo they have absolutely no business with.
So please, don't compare this to a full grown born baby who's breathing autonomously. People who are supporting "killing" embryo's (abortion) are not automatically supporting the murder of newborn babies. They know and make a very clear educated distinction between the various stages.

The flaw in your logic: Opposite from what you assume, Deflation is not bad.
Americans are brought up with the idea that debt is good and that you have to live on debt.
In other parts of the world, people are brought up with the idea that saving money is something good.
Inflation is bad for savers, good for people who go in debt.
Deflation is good for savers, bad for people going in debt.
It's just a matter of in which attitude you were happen to be brought up.
Deflation is not going to stop people from spending. It only makes people spend **when they need to**. It's against consumerism, it's against the throw-away society. It's good for a sustainable, environmental aware society.
Of course people who depend on consumerism will not admit this and say a deflationary currency is bad, but, we can ignore them.

You are making one big mistake in your reasoning.
We are now living in a world that fully relies on technology.
Bitcoin is a technology that can and will enhance various processes in society.
If one country decides to ban bitcoin (as in, shuts down all exchanges and fiat tarnsactions, ban establishments from accepting bitcoin, rendering it virtually useless within their country),
they are automatically putting their country in a **major technological disadvantage**. Rendering themselves useless on a global scale. It's like banning internet and throwing themselves back 2 decades to the past.
Some naive 3rd world country with an incompetent government might try this. But their experiment won't last for long.
Game theory makes it virtually impossible for a country to "ban bitcoin" per your definition.
Just like it is impossible but "possible" to ban the internet, 
it is similarly impossible but "possible" to ban bitcoin.
The "governments can ban it" is an argument that was original made up by people who thought that Bitcoin is a product, comparable to how a random R-rated videogame is a (bannable) product.
But Bitcoin isn't a product. It's a technology.

I think it just means the "large audience" is not ready for it, today.
Before 2013, people were estimating that Bitcoin would go mainstream in 2018 or something.
Now, with the sudden price rise in 2013, you see articles showing up "Prices surge as Bitcoin is going mainstream". It's not surging because it's going mainstream, it's surging for other reasons. Businesses and Bitcoin services probably need to mature first. And once they are, it will go mainstream and the large audience will be reached.

I haven't explained another important function of ripples in my post.
Your account needs to have a minimum amount of XRP in order to function.
Each contact that you have, costs 50 XRP. You don't actually have to pay 50 XRP but you just need to hold 50 XRP in your account for each contact that you have. Each Bid or Ask order that you place, also requires 50 XRP. 
This is a mechanism to prevent abuse of this "free" system. If nothing would be required, then bots could be placing millions of orders, overloading the Ripple network with garbage.
The more XRP you have, the more you can do with your account. 350 XRP are enough for regular users, but for businesses or trading bots, it would be more interesting to have a few thousands XRPs. The more you do with your account, the more XRP you need.
But again, these XRP stay in your account, if after 2 years you decide to quit the Ripple network for some reason, you still have all your XRP and you can give them away or sell them to someone else.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:07:27
You are correct in case you are expecting Ripple to become a currency.
But it's not the (original) intention of the creators to see XRP as a currency. XRP must be perceived like post stamps. You send Bitcoins, Euros, Dollars, Yen, etc... from one side of the world to the other through the ripple network, while incurring 0 % fees. But the 1 thing that you do have to pay, are XRPs, because they act like a post stamp on your transaction.
You have to see the Ripple as a P2P exchange and XRP's as post stamps for the transactions within that exchange, NOT as a currency.
The whole fuss about XRP is the fact that it COULD be used as a currency, but only if the public would decide to do that. It's the same like a store selling a tomato for post stamps instead of cash. People on the internet could decide to sell digital games for digital post stamps ( XRPs ) instead of cash ( Bitcoins ).
Ripple is not doomed to fail as a P2P exchange. But if you decide to perceive XRP's as cash, then you could say that XRP's are doomed to fail as a currency, because indeed it's all premined. 
XRP's get their value from the ease of transporting any currency ( BTC, Euro, Dollar, Yen, ) from 1 place to another. 
It cuts down BTC transaction speed from 10 or 60 minutes down to 10 seconds: you no longer need to wait for x confirmations.
The bottom line is: 
Ripple is great for Bitcoin because it solves some major problems that Bitcoin has concerning safety, useability, and transaction speed. 
But at the same time Ripple is dangerous for Bitcoin in the case that people would decide to see XRPs as currencies instead of just post stamps.

Keep in mind that the economist news sites have started talking about bitcoins since 1,5 week.
People always need time (at least a few days) to digest all that information when they hear about something the first time, and when they are convinced, they need to get their funds moved to MtGox and other sites, which takes a few days again.
I think that next week, we'll see loads of fresh money pouring into the market as a result from this, and that's why I think we'll be hitting $100 in 2 weeks time. You don't want to miss this rally.

Bitcoin currently uses the equivalent of 7-8 wind power turbines.
The competition: PayPal alone, with 13,000 employees and 40,000 servers, runs on around 8 wind power turbines. The credit card companies use an order of magnitude more power than this.
With only this power usage, Bitcoin can supplant everything, that is: 
* all the credit cards (MasterCard, Visa, American Express, ...),
* all the payment providers ( PayPal, WorldPay, Western Union, .... ),
* and potentially, all the banks ( Barclays, HSBC, citi, ...).

The thing is that, if criminals know that innocent lawful citizens don't have guns,
these criminals will not carry any heavy weaponry because a small gun will suffice.
Smaller guns mean smaller wounds. Smaller guns mean less bullets. Smaller guns mean less casualties overall.
**In fact**, most criminals don't even have a gun! They use knifes. That's even less deaths.
But that's something that your weapon lobbyists will ignore and you will be their puppet who brainlessly repeats their arguments, for their pockets. 
No, we don't have that type of slavery, and "your" ( = actually their ) arguments, are not going to convince me that my country is wrong concerning the gun ban: 
I don't know anyone in my family or friend circle who ever stood face to face with a criminal pointing a knife or gun at them.
We don't live in the wild west anymore, cowboy.
And we are all feeling very safe. 
Feeling safe by default, is something that you can only dream of it seems. Now that's something to think about.

Well said,
I got bashed by libertarians for some non-libertarian advantages that I saw in Bitcoin.
They can eat the shit.
I don't like greedy companies ( banks are companies too) and greedy companies thrive on the broken monetary system of USDs.
Bitcoin fixes that and takes the built-in bankruptcy out of the system, so companies have a harder time to put each other into bankruptcy, because more equality emerges out of the fairer Bitcoin system.

I've been in the same situation as you, but that was 3 years ago.
I had build my own computer ( a desktop tower ) with 4 graphics cards ( Radeon ). It was profitable back then, because:
a) not so much competition, so more Bitcoins / day
b) I could resell some of my hardware afterwards at the same price as I bought it, because my graphics cards went up in value
I learned how to assemble a computer, I learned a lot about heat management ( I used the coolest place in the house which would become the sauna of my house 2 months later )
Half of my Bitcoins got stolen by the mining pool owner, who shut down the website, so that's another lesson I've learned: fuck people.
So by all means, do it, it's fun and you can learn a lot by it, but don't expect to turn a profit, or a big profit. Nowadays, you are competing with professional miners that use high-tech hardware.
I used this chart:
for calculating how to get the most btc / price.
Don't be cheap on CPU or RAM, that was my mistake. My miner is now my main game computer, and I had to throw away my RAM and CPU for more RAM and a better CPU. Should've bought good stuff from the start to avoid unnecessary costs.

I'd rather stay away from the dollar, which was disconnected from gold in 1971. Why did they disconnect it you think? ==&gt; In order to open room for manipulation. 
The government and banking systems don't like gold anymore: They prefer the dollar. That's why they disconnected it from gold. And now they start to criminalize gold, because the dollar is sacred.

I've started testing Ripple.
It's the first P2P exchange I've ever used, and it works pretty good, the system looks promising: it includes BTC, Euro, Yen, US dollar, Australian dollar, British ponds, XRP's, and some others....
The only issue currently is the low volume so you get huge spreads, so you have to set your order at the fair price ( by looking at MtGox ) and wait some time until someone decides to buy your BTCs ( or someone sells you his BTCs ).
Low volume is because there are only 5000 users at this moment. Registration is limited, because you can only be activated by an existing Ripple member. This other Ripple member must activate your account by sending 350 Ripples ( XRP ).
*I have bought my own ripples so I can't give them away, but I'm willing to trade Ripples for BTC's to anyone who wants to start rippling. I charge $3.5 dollar ( or 0.038 BTC) for account activation which includes 350 Ripples. This is only a good offer for traders and people who want to invest in Ripples quickly, today.*
*The rest should wait for free Ripples giveaways ( = account activations) that will be coming in May and beyond.*

Bitstamp is just an example of 1 Gateway that currently exists.
Anyone can be a gateway, if he has the legal authority to act like one. Bitstamp is, by coincidence, an exchange as well.

Ripple still has some things to prove.
We should wait until it's open-sourced because closed-source as it is now, is of course a very bad thing. They've promised to make it open-source so now we have to see if they are keeping that promise.
The guy says *"Every single premined cryptocurrency has failed, and Ripple is no exception."* so he hasn't really understood the fact that Ripple is not meant to be a cryptocurrency.
His points about debt are valid, I haven't researched yet what would happen if a gateway can not repay. But that's also a known flaw of the current fiat and banking system in the real world. That's why the financial system is collapsing and banks are stealing money from the accounts to cover the losses.
So for now, staying on the fence is the best approach, certainly for a merchant.

The way the dollar system is built, is that the people in power ( = the central banks ) get WAY unfairly compensated, by printing extra money themselves, for themselves.

Not entirely true though.
You need to have ~50 ripples in your account available at all times just as a reserve for **each** order you place or for each node you trust. So 1000 ripples in your account means you can have 20 outstanding orders at any given time.
But the main issue with that is that they can change these numbers at will. Today it's 50 ripples, non-scalable. They can make it 100 ripple tomorrow or 20 ripple per order. This randomness makes the value of a ripple entirely unpredictable. They can change the value of a ripple artificially at will by changing these variables.

Analyze what type of people were in Bitcoin before the media coverage. To sum them up: believers, people who carefully analyzed Bitcoin, trying to understand as much as they can, who just buy because they believe.
Now after the media coverage: 
the believers see they have done a better research on their own which the media apparently didn't do, so they don't really care about bad press.
Of all the people who get to know Bitcoin through the press, there are 2 groups: people who say "wtf is this bullshit" but they didn't have any coins in the first place so they can't sell to press the price down. And then you have many other people who hear about Bitcoin for the first time and say "hey, this is interesting" and they register at MtGox, to end up in a queue of 30 000 other newly interested persons. These are all buyers, not sellers.

We have all been brought up with the idea it's all about competition and beating the rest. I think there are better ways to build societies. If money becomes valuable, people need to work less. A typical job week can be cut from 40 hours to just 20 hours. This can create jobs, because more people will be needed to fill in a 40-hour work week. Additionally, individuals will have more spare time. In the past, it were rich people who had plenty of spare time, who used that time to come up with some of the greatest inventions that we depend on today. We should not live to work, we should only work to live. Fuck competition at the cost of those who end up at the bottom of it: there will always be someone who finishes last. And in the end, society as a whole pays the price for that in the form of human costs or environmental costs. We need to step away from such a system.


Product prices will stay dependent on supply and demand. Poverty and homelessness is build in into an inflationary system, because it is a game of musical chairs, where in every inflationary step, a chair is being taken away and someone ends up in poverty. 
A deflationary system will give those who are left behind with the least, an edge overtime and a chance to catch up. It equals things out overtime instead of leaving people behind at an ever increasing distance.
There are no records of a deflationary system in human history which would be comparable to Bitcoin. We have never attempted it. The deflationary spiral you are referring to during the great depression, had nothing to do with currencies. 
We have never had a deflationary currency because it was practically impossible to implement such a system. That's what's so unprecedented about the Bitcoin system.

During inflation, everyones money is losing some value.
This value must have been transferred to somewhere, it doesn't just "disappear". It moves to people, entities, companies, banks, you name it which play the game better than others.
It's like a game of musical chairs. There are 10 chairs.
Inflation means someone takes 1 chair away. 9 will still sit down, at the cost of 1 going broke.
Inflation means that losing wealth, bankruptcy, being poor, is baked into the system. It makes it an absolute certainty that someone is going to lose out. You could walk up to the person and say: "it's your fault, you didn't do your best enough, you should have worked harder, been smarter, make better decisions".
Now imagine you could go back in time and help that person making better decisions, it will help him to not lose out and keep a chair. But now someone else is going to lose out, because it's a certainty that someone is going to lose out.
That's inflation. And that is the problem I have with inflation: We force the weakest ones to pay for their weakness, while none of them chose to be part of such a system, they just happened to be born in it.
Compare that to deflation. 10 chairs become 11 chairs. It distributes the wealth. It works towards equality of people. It was practically difficult or impossible to implement such a system in human history, until Bitcoin was invented.

It's funny how people try to see a logical pattern in the charts, while the reality is that everything that happened today / yesterday, was just caused by software issues @ MtGox, causing a lot of randomness from panickers.
Actually, they are almost claiming that they saw the MtGox software issues coming by looking at the charts, because "hey, the pattern predicted it".
Sorry, but it's really a bunch of bullshit. At least in this case.
*There will always be a pattern, if you look for it.*
Let me end this post with some fundamentals instead:
**MtGox**: *The number of new accounts opened went from 60k for March alone to 75k new account created for the first few days of April! We now have roughly 20,000 new accounts created each day.*
Basically, a lot of people were and are registering accounts with only 1 goal: to buy ( not to sell, sellers already have an account ). 
These new registrants are mainly Europeans:
I assume this, because of 
* the recent European trouble 
* the high media exposure of Bitcoin in Europe in recent days because of that
* the timing of the server trouble, it always starts to happen when Europeans get home from work till midnight when they go to bed
But, importantly, they haven't had a chance yet to buy, because the servers of MtGox crashed as we have all witnessed. The servers are now back up while _now it's the middle of the night_ in Europe and they are all asleep. New server upgrades are going to arrive in the next 24 hours to handle all that upcoming trading traffic.
*If this is all true, you might want to buy* **now** *@ 130 EUR / 172 USD.*

Decentralized P2P exchanges which can't be DDoS'ed,
and international transferring of money at 0 costs. 
That's really the main thing.

But the fact remains they are getting a $200 tip at the BTC price of next year, so I think they shouldn't be too lazy about it.

There are special nodes in the network, called "Gateways".
Bitstamp is such a gateway. MtGox could become a gateway as well.
Gateways are used to transfer USD and BTC into Ripple or out of Ripple.
An example:
I send 10 BTC to my Bitstamp account. In my bitstamp account I can choose to transfer 10 BTC to my Ripple address.
10 BTC is removed from my Bitstamp balance and added to my Ripple BTC balance. At that moment, my 10 BTC is still physically stored at Bitstamp. I send my 10 BTC to Anne, and after that, Anne sends 5 BTC to Mark and 5 BTC to Jeffrey.
Jeffrey has an account at MtGox and lets assume that MtGox is a Ripple gateway. Jeffrey can transfer those 5 BTC to his MtGox account. Jeffrey can now withdraw 5 BTC from MtGox to his wallet.
By backtracing the route, MtGox knows, that Bitstamp is now owing 5 BTC to MtGox. The gateways know from each other how much they owe to who.
Exchanging BTC to USD works with the currency exchanges within Ripple, where you place orders "125 $ for 1 BTC" and if someone accepts that order, your account balance goes down 125 $ and 1 BTC up. The transaction itself happens automatically and the gateways can now backtrace the information they need to settle the amounts they owe each other.

It's culture based.
From what I hear about the USA, it's all about spending. They invented the credits card for it and encouraged having a debt.
In European countries however, people are putting a lot of their savings into their bank accounts. In 2010, the *average* Belgian citizen owned slightly more than $86,000 in their bank accounts.
The *average* US _family_ however, only owns $3,800 in their bank account.
This is a huge difference, these are two different cultures.
The worldwide printing of money these days is affecting Europeans more than Americans: 
* Europeans see the values of their savings diminishing because each positive $ is losing value
* while Americans see their debts diminishing because each negative $ is losing value.

Here's the thing:
1 BTC is still equal to 1 BTC
It's the dollar that's making such a crazy moves. You should ask yourself how can anyone do business in such a volatile dollar?
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:45:09
The thing you forget is:
The current currencies like Dollar / Euro require additional services/conveniences to be build on top of the currency.
Bitcoin however, has a big part of these services build in already, and more is going to come in the future.

DDoS'ing is only temporarily. It wont affect the relation between Bitstamp and MtGox.
Anyone who sends money from 1 place to another, has to pay XRP. XRP's are a requirement to have when using Ripple. No XRPs means no actions. Currently, XRPs are being given away freely. If ppl want more XRP, they can buy them from others.

If you look at the order book and you see hundreds of 0.01 BTC orders passing by, priced at the lowest end of the spread fork, you have to be incredibly naive that hundreds of people are sincerely buying Bitcoins at 60 cents per order.
It's ok to laugh with conspiracy theories, as long as they are ridiculously far-fetched, which currently is not the case.
This is market manipulation.

It's true that people will hoard to a certain extent. But people still need to eat. People still need to buy a house.
Would people really prefer hoarding + living under a bridge above buying a house?
People will still spend when they need to. But ONLY when they need to. And I think that's a better thing. 
**Light bulbs:**
In 1900, men invented light bulbs that would last for a 100 years. Today, light bulbs need to be changed every 5 years. Inflation makes it more interesting for companies to make stuff that breaks, and that same inflation also means that people don't really have to care to replace broken light bulbs: they better spend their money quickly on new light bulbs than hoarding it. 
Compare this to a world with deflation. Would you still spend your valuable coins to buy a light bulb that breaks after 5 years when another company offers a light bulb that shines for a 100 years?
Deflation makes money a valuable thing. It makes people think twice before spending. It forces companies to put quality above quantity. Our environment will be thankful. [Our planet needs deflation, not inflation.](
Bitcoin is the first technology in human history that can offer us a **usable** deflationary system.
