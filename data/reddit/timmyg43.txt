Legitimate question: what is with the beef between BTC vs BCH? BCH is for everyday use and BTC is a store of value.

TBH, I’m a fan of both. Bigger blocks, on-chain to me seem to be the better solution.

In person or via internet?

You can buy from just about any exchange. The trick is to find an exchange to convert fiat into crypto. In the States, Coinbase and BitStamp are popular.

Lightning sucks. Bitcoin shouldn’t need it.

Nope. I’m a Bitcoin fan but seem to lean towards BCH than BTC.

I like where you went there. 
Who could “certify” the paper wallets in a decentralized society?
Bitcoin could be expressed into fractions of Satoshis but do you think the Developers would actually do that? 
Power consumption, yes. 
There would have to be more than SegWit and Lightning because those are failures. Second layer solutions are in its infancy and would need to be way more mature than today’s current state.

No chance. If BTC can figure out scaling issues and keep the transactions less than a penny then it has potential. Until then it is a pipe dream.

I agree with the post. Not even remotely possible. There are close to an infinite amount of problems to overcome. BTC would have to be worth at least $1M and would be dealing in microtransactions, would need to figure out the power consumption problem, infrastructure problem, scaling problem, every human on Earth would need a phone/device for their wallet, etc.
