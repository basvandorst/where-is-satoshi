Very serious. This is a statement made from the comfort of good old hindsight. We know of course that since 2011 the price rocketed, but we only know that thanks to hindsight. 
We don't know where the price will go from here. I expect it to be up, but we don't know that, it could go down, might never come back up. It might settle at $50, but get global adoption and become the reserve currency. Who knows really?

I don't think you can compare houses to bitcoins. People have lived in houses for over a thousand years now, and its an essential item (food, clothes, shelter). Bitcoin could possibly be replaced by another tech, but a spot of land with a building on it is always going to be a demand.

It could be though. Whats to say at some point an authority enforces regulation on it? If a shareholders group has the autonomy outside of PoW to create more currency, then there is nothing to stop another authority enforcing regulation and control over those shareholders. That might be via the law or the gun.
That is not possible with bitcoin as creation of new coins is both finite and based on proof of work. No one can manipulate the math at anytime to change that.

I actually did my first purchase yesterday. One whole coin via UK bank transfer. 
I actually got into bitcoin last year, but never bought many. Now i intend to buy one coin a month instead of putting it into a savings account. I had planned to keep saving cash to buy a house, but savings rates in the UK are around 1.3 % (lower then inflation) while the housing market is seeing gains of between 8 to 10%' even though wage increases are not there. Its insane and its left me disillusioned. The money i have saved is being chipped at and devalued everyday.
I understand there is some risk in this, but fuck it, i have had enough of the old rigged system and i fear if another recession hits i cannot see any limits on what might happen to disenfrancise the common man.
I know want to do everything i can to get a new system going, so not only save, but try to make as many purchases that i can in crypto.

With bitbargain.co.uk you verify your identity with the company and then after that your on a level playing field with everyone else, just click buy, bank transfer and send your coins to your wallet. 
Already used them to buy two coins, both times took about 3-5 minutes to complete.

volatility is not permanent, nor is it a bad thing considering the innovation going on and means to negate flucuation already in place. consolidated mining becomes less of an issue as more coins are created. Bitcoins issue is more user tools and transactional performance.

The big fat 'deflation is bad' argument is as cancerous as the 'too big to fail' argument.
Deflation is nothing more than a response to previous inflation. Its a correction. 
So why would anyone claim its bad?
Deflation does hit the debtors as you rightly said, with the likely outcome being they will default on their debt. The default of debt is the main concern here as that then impacts the systemic flaws within the financial sector. A sector that has debt pumping through its system as its life blood. 
Debt is spun and dressed in thousands of complex derivatives. When those derivatives fail as the debtors start to default (hello subprime mortgages), the banks fall on their ass again. We then see an obscene amount of QE invoked to magic up more money to replace the previous 'out of thin air' money since defaulted by the debtors.

Up-voting you as I love a good devils advocate, so important to debate. 
Just one point, we don't know that they are dumping to fiat. It would not surprise me if a few of them are taking 75/25 or even 50/50. We know a good number of vendors are taking 100% BTC.
These companies have already made a vote of confidence in BTC, especially Microsoft. With the money they turn over, its obvious they choose BTC as a future strategy, not an immediate return of investment. They will have a long term plan of sorts - every business does. I am fairly sure its not been implemented as bitcoin is cute. So with that in hand, its very likley they would have a plan to build up a operational reserve of BTC funds and perhaps even then accept bitcoin direct with no payment processor. 
My view on what their plan consists of... 
With xbox and gaming in general its become very centered on micro transactions, e.g. selling hats and unlocking new guns, DLC etc. Often this stuff is sold for as low as $0.75 and with someone like visa in the middle, it reduces the footprint of such a small payment. Even more so when the fund needs to be shared between the content delivery platform (xbox live) and the developers (indie game studios). BTC would make micro transactions scope to whole new level. 
I expect Minecraft will be one of the the fertile grounds that grows the business model. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 07:57:04

@_date: 2014-12-07 08:54:57
Lets be honest, bitcoin is not ready for mainstream use. I expect we need another five years yet to develop the supporting tech needed to provide a main stream user experience.
I like the way Andreas puts it...at the moment bitcoin is like early email. The concept sounds great, but to send an email in the early days, you needed to use vi or emacs, save the content as a text file to /var/spool/mail and then use some sendmail commands to push out the email to its recipient. You needed to be a complete geek to handle the tools.
Back then a few people would have laughed if you told them it would become the majority form of written communication..some people even mocked the internet becoming anything big.. But once the protocol was in place and functioning well, then the innovation followed and people developed pop, imap, nice looking GUI clients with full word processing type format tools, webmail, exchange, smartphone clients etc, etc.
This is how it is with bitcoin. The core functions are present, and they are very sound, we just need time and innovation to happen and right now innovation is a hotbed of activity with no shortage of VC's wanting in on the action.
Tl;dr to early to make that call.

@_date: 2014-12-11 08:59:24
I have two young kids that are already starting to get interested in gaming and techie things. Mainly stuff like mickey mouse fun house or despicable me 2 platform jumper.. Its only a matter of time that they will want to buy something transactional based. That would mean daddies credit card would be used, fixed into an account and open me up for all sorts of unneeded hassles. 
With this model I can just send a few bits to there account and its up to them to manage them, and purchase what they want. 
**That blows my mind**. Under ten year olds using bitcoin and not seeing it as anything out of the ordinary. "Daddy, can I have some more BTC?"
I can see myself giving them pocket money in bitcoin soon. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 11:50:44
I am guessing its not that simple though. They are local laws to adhere to and technical stuff such as geo-redundancy. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:35:48
Exactly. A bitcoin is a token / transaction and could take form as a share in a company, vote in an election, token of ownership, currency etc etc.
That is what reddit is doing, which is what most of the great minds in the bitcoin community are excited about. Its running corporates transparently on the blockchain.
Also it uses sidechains. There is no premine. 
A good intro here:

@_date: 2014-12-10 07:54:03
Not a challenge, a sincere question. When all of the blocks have been mined, what will be the incentive then?
I am guessing it won't matter, as only the transactions need to be verifed which could be done by a smaller subset of nodes?

As states, the price is based on demand. So even though amazing good news, its not enough to change the price unless people act on the news and buy.
Now, if its news around an occurrence which affects peoples wealth, such as a major economic event (like cypress) where people need to quickly move money into other stores of value, or else lose it to hyperinflation or a government grab, then you will see the price go up a significant amount.

My comment:
I briefly read over the whitepaper.
As I understand it there is an offline key. If the users private key is stolen they can use the secondary offline key to transfer the funds back to another address. To prevent abuse, the developers are talking about there being an 'open window' time where within a certain time-frame, transactions can be reversed.
I see an issue here.
First off lets look at the time-frame. If the time-frame is for example one hour, this would not be sufficient time for people to discover there private key has been stolen and the funds have been moved else where. Most people check balance around once a day, if that.
So lets assume 24 hours. Well the problem here is that for any major transactions where you want to be sure you really get your money, without the other side doing a reverse back, 24 hours would be far to long. Right away all the beauty of bitcoin is lost (fast transaction / confirmations).
Another issue I see is this. Someone steals your private key, or you somehow mistakenly send the money to the wrong address. A lot of recipients won't use the same public key address that receives units to store units. So if someone transfers the reversecoin to a first address, and the recipient decides to send it on to another second address (with a different private key, not associated with the senders offline key), the original senders private key will not be able to reverse the transaction.
Seems like there are a lot of flaws with this approach
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:00:09
They are not referring to overall security, but how the private keys are protected.
When it comes to this domain, hardware security modules (HSM's) used by banks from vendors such as [thales]( or [realsec]( are very, very secure and if not already, will I am sure be adopted for crypto currency private keys.
These are the same babies that often store root CA's for verisign etc.
@_date: 2014-12-07 09:14:59
Cost combined with the amount of BTC i own. I don't own enough to merit spending $100 dollars for protection.

Interesting, but a lot of security measures would need to be built in. Otherwise people would have BOTs crawling around repeating making GET requests with no purpose but to harvest BTC from the advertisers.
I expect would also need to develop a browser or someone who add a wallet address to the http headers. Addons are not secure enough.

To be fair, you put that woman on the spot and I am not surprised she behaved as she did.  
She had to do that, as for all she knew the situation might have been set up. She likely did not care about you / him keeping the fiver, but as she was in that position, she needed to follow company protocol (as did the cleaner) as to do otherwise could mean losing a secure job (its pretty good working for the underground) and in turn not paying a mortgage etc etc.

I wish these lot the best of luck, I do, but I can't see how they will deliver anything past phase one (usb dongles).
For them to be given chip real estate in hardware, with no return of investment to the vendor, well its just not going to happen.
Even more the case for smartphones. Every single millimeter inside a mobiles casing is optimized to try and make it a thin and streamlined unit that dissipates as little heat as possible.
Device vendors are going to want to see a seriously big ROI for giving up precious chip real estate and taking on risk.

Well, this has not been confirmed by Microsoft, so its speculation. For all we know Microsoft might be taking bitcoin from bitpay.
Think of it this way. Microsoft have just shown a lot of confidence in bitcoin by today's news. If they believe there is a future for bitcoin, then what better way then this is there to build up reserves for should they decide to start taking payments direct, without mediation from a company such as bitpay.
In another thread, a bitpay employee just confirmed that %50 of their merchants were not converting to fiat and were instead directly taking bitcoin.

I was talking about pre-mass adoption. 
When email was first made available, I needed to use vi / emacs to create a text file, write the email, copy it to /var/spool/email, call the sendmail binary and then run a series of commands to send the email out. Anyone back then would have been, "yeah, right, I can just see myself wanting to use that"
It was only when the user experience was improved, that the masses took the tech on without needing to now what SMTP was.

Whats in it for the Telco? They are businesses at the end of the day. 
Your suggesting they migrate their billing systems which have costs millions of dollars to implement to a system which accepts bicoin. Why? Its cool for bitcoin, but you would need to sell it to them. Telcos will immediately look at ROI (Return of Investment). What is the ROI here? 
Why would they do that?
A better option might be to allow users to settle the monthly charges using bitcoin.

Satoshi already had this covered in the whitepaper, its called Simplified Payment Verification (which is what Electrum / Smartphone based wallets implement)
8. Simplified Payment Verification
It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch
linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for
himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,
and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.

How on earth will they get device vendors to buy it into this?
I really cannot see Apple, Microsoft (Nokia Buyout), Samsung or HTC Corp agreeing to this. Chip Real estate within a smartphones is already under huge pressure to get thinner and less heat intensive, more battery optimized. There is no way on earth they will accept a mining chip which does nothing for them. Not to mention they need to also convince end users its ok.

There is no problem, unless competition worries you. The worry is all to often rooted in a perceived threat to investment and its anti innovation. Bitcoiners complaining about alt coins, reminds me of MasterCard complaining about bitcoin.

Nubits is flawed as it has all the attributes of a centralized monetary system. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:38:51
There is a group of shareholders who decide which currency to peg to. This is not to different to a centralized system and is suspectable to hostile take overs.
It is also closed source as you mention. A motion was made recently to open source the code, and it was rejected by the shareholders. 
I discussed the whole thing with a group of nubit guys here, that makes clear my stance on the currency (I want nothing to do with it)

It might well be, I have not bothered following it since it first was released as it was flawed from the onset. It negates the whole beauty of cryptocoin, by constantly fluctuating supply, and all for what, less volatility - which in the light of BTC stabilizing, leaves it even more redundant.
