The same reason I buy the Humble Bundle with Bitcoin?

This is getting really old, really fast.

Dude! Awesome! Any plans to add support for alternate currencies such as £?
@_date: 2014-08-21 09:53:59
Outstanding work! Really like it. I guess as an expansion to this, any way to set a Default?
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:06:02
I'll leave larger tips as both a mix of cash + Bitcoin, but this is just more more raising awareness of Bitcoin in general.
Just need to find somebody who can do the translation now.

Absolutely love this Wallet, got around 150mBTC stored in it for daily spending. Keep up the good work guys!
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:26:22
Exactly why I plan to keep the Private Keys. My thought train was to make sure the description on the Wallets were simple enough that anybody can understand. But at the same time I can see the high potential failure rate.
That, and Beer sounds good.

Agreed, I'm a huge fan of pfSense but 'Corp' is not something I'd call them. They're a 'Company' or 'Business'. Not a Corporation.

To the best of my knowledge. But then never store Bitcoins on a Jailbroken or Rooted device unless you REALLY know what you're doing.

Didn't somebody say that about E-Mail once? As did Western Union regarding the use of a 'Telephone'... idiot.

To the best of my knowledge, Finger Prints are stored in the Keychain. And to the best of my knowledge there are no known exploits for any of Apples Keychain implementations.

Hmm, I just learning how Bitcoin tips work via ChangeTip, this is pretty cool!
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:37:54
Thanks dude!

Works fine here, as their service has had an overall good rep via this Subreddit I'll go out on a limb here and fix your title.
"After waiting for so long, I've had an overall bad experience with Circle"
Circle is not a piece of shit, I've used it a few times now with a completely flawless experience, if their support teams are investigating this you're best off waiting and not being rude to them. Working in Corporate Customer Service myself I can tell you we don't give high priority to rude people. Be patient and I hope you get your issue resolved.

Original Thread for those asking... 
@_date: 2014-06-28 11:08:48
What have I created?! :D
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:40:51
I just wish what printed out was a pretty as what the BitcoinPaperWallet project generated. 
But I do understand they serve two different use cases.

Nothing is stopping anybody installing Enterprise Signed Apps via MDM or Safari. I've pushed a ton of apps to my iPhone, including Torrent Apps etc, via Safari. Hell, Pheeva the Bitcoin wallet is AppStore AND enterprise signed.
@_date: 2014-07-16 09:48:51
Anything like this available in the UK?
@_date: 2014-09-03 06:16:15
Ahh man, this is a real shame. I've posted this page on - my favourite YouTubers requesting that they consider Bitcoin donations in future (
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:11:49
Not yet, I think BFL are busy with their lawsuits over the miners!
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:38:54
Pheeva is my favourite. Now it's on the AppStore too.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:11:34
I tested this a while ago, was fairly unstable and unreliable. That said, great idea. Except the logo, that's terrible.
@_date: 2015-05-06 06:34:28
What a great idea! Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:49:13
Really like the idea of this! I figured it'd be using some kind of MDM to handle an Install Application command to bypass the AppStore, but it installs without needing any MDM. Awesome!

It's a good thing Time Inc. aren't a corporation!
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:04:30
For me, this is that product.
But what you've got to remember is most people will probably use Mobile Devices to manage this. So we don't need an iMac like product, we need a simple, clean, App. For me Pheeva does that job.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:27:48
Thanks :)

But tipping is so fun, just not to those who ask! 500 bits @_date: 2015-07-08 12:03:11
I had exactly the same issue yesterday. Bread wallet should get some fixes for this soon hopefully.
@_date: 2015-03-29 13:03:54
The only thing I don't like about Namecheap is that 50% of the site is a dream to work with and the other 50% is a pure UX nightmare. That said, I use the service and am very happy with it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:22:06
Dude - exactly the same thing. Word for word happened to me. Mine was 0.8 BTC and worth £490. Really killed me. I plan to pay PayPal back over the next 100 months @ £4.90 a month.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:55:09
Has my bank details so I'm sure they could take me to court eventually by tracking me down.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:38:28
Well, my account is -£490 at the moment and I cancelled my Debit Card and Direct Debit to them. So they can't take it from my bank Account. So I'll trickle feed the money in from another PayPal account for the next few years... lol.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:04:20
Yeah - PayPal screwed me over big time on a Bitcoin deal and I 'almost' lost out on £500. Thankfully I was able to prove my case and got my money back. But yeah, Bitcoin &gt; Centralised Payment companies!
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:10:04
Dude - I'll be signing up in the next few days! Bitcoin could be a semi-solution to the sheer amount of Porn Piracy out there. I'd be happier to pay with BTC than with my Credit Card.
