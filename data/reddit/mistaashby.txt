How about a physical fabrication of our digital hopes and dreams (corny af) lol but i thought they would be cool to make. And I would accept btc only of course. Sacrilegious otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:09:51
You idiot. This can crush the US access to crypto and mining.

I cannot put net neutrality in my headline, I get kicked from the group I’m asking. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:56:23
Because I believe in it and will buy more with this shit paper we call a dollar. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:02:08
Inflation is a mfer. Good thing I have some bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:07:02
Net neutrality... :(
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:23:25
Just curious if there would be a market for these. I personally think they would be super cool.  Kinda like the letters you may have on a mantle for your last name maybe 12-24” in height 1-2” depth. Something like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:38:06
Thanks, that’s why I’m asking. Will try to design one tomorrow. Maybe I can sway your interest!
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:17:43
I sold all my holdings the second Pai mentioned btc and btc mining at the net neutrality hearing. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:07:31
Net neutrality... :(
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:16:34
Okay, this is why I asked. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:22:00
It’s in my fuckin mind bro lol I see paywalls for mining and exchanges ect
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:17:53
My post was blocked when I put net neutrality in it. I’m asking the brain trust of Reddit’s opinion. I will edit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:34:47
I’m not going to worry myself to death over it. I have lost some sleep over not keeping up with it or saving that wallet. Hurts my heart to know that I had it in my hands and we lost it. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:38:12
He just cites that btc mining consumes “major bandwidth.” We know this is untrue, we can mine on dial up. But just the fact that the cockroach mentioned it scared me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:27:25
I know what you mean. Good thing I have a heaping .02  unfortunately my cousin and I mined this back in 2009 or 2010 but I didn’t know or understand what we were doing. Probably have a wallet lost in space with a few btc in it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:51:18
This was relevant. And Pai just mentioned btc mining in his statement. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:07:11
Net neutrality... :(
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:27:39
Like don’t let the cat out of the bag? Or like Trump you have a lot to gain so don’t say anything about grabbing pussy?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:19:13
Edited. Seriously, wtf is going to happen!?!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:19:35
lol right? just makes you want to put your btc address on here and panhandle for satoshi lmao
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:16:22
It’s a total shit show and I’m terrified. That’s why I ask the question. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:04:09
Please explain. I’m seeking answers or ridicule. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:09:00
YES!!! They can block our access to crypto exchanges or put us behind a pay wall and the same for mining!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:23
No, it was some broke ass discarded PCs with whatever we could scrape together. Think we have about 6 computers put together. I think only one of them had a case lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:25:59
Not yet. But I’ll try to draft my waterjet file at work tomorrow. (When no one is looking lol)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:28
I mean I recently bought btc. We did mine back in the infancy with several rigged PCs. My cousin spent all his buying better pc equipment. I never used mine. And never kept up with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:14:59
Do you even know what’s going on?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:48:43
I’ve only mined for a few days now. I’ve earned about .00148984 btc in about 4 days. I did this a long time ago and earned several btc but it wasn’t valuable, probably have a wallet with several btc in it sadly. That was 7-8 years ago. But I figured I’d buy a gpu and hoard up some btc before the masses get into it. The gpu/electricity cost isn’t much concern, I’m betting on the value of the btc earned. But I’m also interested in building a separate rig for mining altcoin, but I want to mine several alts and just sit on them for a few years and cross my fingers. I don’t have the money to buy 1.0 btc, but I do have the money to gamble on the micro coins. But I don’t know where to mine them or store them. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:58:53
Well, I don’t want to lose it. My life isn’t over if it tanks lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:59:33
Is that the same as a cold wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:09:32
You can buy an entire mall for 330 btc lmao
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:36:35
Prop from the show How I Met Your Mother. This was MarshalL and Lily's Long Term Bet Box from season 7 episode 17 "No pressure"
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:24:19
What’s the best way to enter mining? Bit or altcoin? My cousin pushed GPU over the asic type so I could get alt coin to trade for btc. I’m open to change. I haven’t bought the gpu yet. But it’s literally in my amazon cart.

I’m running NH. But looking to earn various other coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:59
Oh I get down voted for asking a prominent question in our investment?
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:28:03
I have purchased $100 of btc and wanted to mine. I’m open to alternatives eg cloud mining, alt coin, or other. I just wanted to try to get into it and have a bit of a hobby. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:54:16
Lol well Kentucky is fucked. Might as well be kensucky. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:44:42
What about MinerGate?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:18:47
Okay thanks! I’ve been running NH but looking to earn other cryptos and diversify my interest. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:15:32
I have a little more than basic computer knowledge. Pirate Bay and probably a terabyte and a half of media. But idk enough to get around these things if this comes to fruition. What kind of class/classes could I take at my local college that I could learn how to do what I want to do on a restricted internet such as the proposed net neutrality dismantling. Where do I begin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:39:52
I created a blockchain wallet a while back but Coinbase just seemed easier to deal with upfront. Should I switch wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:47:18
I like the appeal of Coinomi, I mined six years ago and I’m interested in making a go of it again with all the little altcoins. And the variety this wallet can hold seems unparalleled. Can I sell any altcoin on Coinomi for a bit of $ or is it strictly a wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:38:24
Is it true that Coinbase isn’t a true wallet?

Called my senators and representative today. Even tweeted trump. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:26:29
I just started tonight with my 1070 ti using nicehash. It’s fun, idc what happens. It’s just exciting and worth the potential payout. Would like to get a little more advanced and mine specific coins and hoard them for a few years. But idk wtf I’m doing lol just learning as I go! Thank you all for the words of wisdom and I hope it yields something of value. If not oh well, sometimes life sucks lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:25:23
I was urged to get a gpu to mine alt to get btc in the long run. Is there a better way?
