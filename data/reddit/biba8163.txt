- When creating the OP_HODL address, you'll be providing the public key to an address which you should have the private key for.  
- You will be provided with a Redeem Script.  You will need both the Redeem script AND the corresponding private key for public key you provided in the step above to create and sign the transaction
- I actually have some signed transactions from my OP_HODL addresses and save it in case the coinbin functionality stops working. I have broadcast transactions generated by Coinbin using Electrum and other tools to make sure I can get things working without Coinbin

I would taper my enthusiasm a bit.
-  So far, it takes me some time to open a channel.  I wasn't able to open a channel with a lot of node addresses I had.  I think they have to be online at the time. (EOF error)
- Opening a channel took time (Pending-Open) and some hang for a looong time.  I think you should have your LN Wallet (BTC checking account imo) funded and channels established if you want instant transactions 
- Then the payments don't go through "payment route failure" a lot of times
I think the concept and implementation is amazing but it's probably a lot of things need to be ironed out in order for it to be usable by most people and for it to be stable.  Also, considering that exchanges can't even implement segwit addresses, adoption of this will take time.  
I wouldn't be expecting LN to drastically change everything this year.   It's very exciting and promising but game changers like this take time.

Addresses are not people.  There are over 22+ Million BTC addresses over 10 years.  ~50% of addresses contain just dust.  If you base it on that and say a small percentage of addresses own the majority of Bitcoin then:
- If you hold 1 or more BTC or more, then you are also in the top 3% of addresses that owns 96% of Bitcoin
- If you hold .1 BTC or more, then you are also in the top 11% of addresses that owns 99.1% of Bitcoin
- If you hold .01 BTC or more, then you are also in the top 30% of addresses that owns 99.87% of Bitcoin
What you judge by is a rich list of what percentage of the supply do the largest 100 or 1000 addresses hold.  The top 116 address do own 16% of BTC and that is counting the top exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:09:13
-  Buy Bitcoin @ 1k
-  Bitcoin @ 2k, spend $500
-  Instead of $500 you now have $1500
-  Rinse and Repeat
-  end result = your net worth is always going up, you're not constantly worried about losing everything you put in, after awhile even if Bitcoin drops to zero you may have put in $25K but spent $50k so and you can stomach a complete loss of the remaining $50k 
The point is you can use Bitcoin to really increase your purchasing power and savings rate at the same time while reducing the uneasiness about being invested in a highly speculative asset.  This means you benefit from bitcoin now and also helps the market as a whole since you have less jittery people panicking on every dip/mini-crash.

People who don't see fees and the congestion as a problem have never used bitcoin as a currency but are only in Bitcoin to get rich and speculate.
DNM have used Bitcoin has a currency since the early days and here is a typical transaction of people who depend on Bitcoin for purchases on a weekly basis if not more.  
-  Buy Bitcoin at exchange
-  Deposit bitcoin to mixer (fee + time) (or Shapeshift to Monero nowadays)
-  Deposit bitcoin to DNM (fee + time) (accpetance of Monero is rare)
-  Damn price change and fees, might not have enough!
-  Oh, shit I missed the vendor's cut off ship time by seven hours!
-  Vendor finally gets money from escrow but now must take out bitcoin from DNM ASAP - you think keeping money in exchanges are risky, DNM exit scam all the time.  (quick processing fee + time)
This is sucking money dry out of users who are the ones that made Bitcoin succeed.   Not just stealing money from them but sometimes they can't even carry out their transaction and get their product for days.  
Mocking any attempt at discussions about high fees and a lagging network that is unusable at times is not good for Bitcoin.  I don't think the idea was for Bitcoin's success to rely on speculation, HODL memes and hoping institutional money starts flowing in to make us rich.  I believe in the Core dev team and have high hopes for the LN but doesn't mean that I have to like high fees and an unusuable network unless you're willing to overpay.   It doesn't seem like a good option to keep things the way they are until LN.  I mean through the crypto space, DarkNetMarkets and users with casual interest, Bitcoin has now developed a reputation as being a high fee unusable network.  
This is not good for Bitcoin.  I was listening to one of Andreas' talks and he actually said a good time to do a transaction is to plan to do it late night US time when it isn't clogged up.  As much as I respect Andreas, I mean WTF?!  To a noob who can't get a transaction to go through and who doesn't know how to calculate sat/bytes, Roger Ver sounds more reasonable when they hear this one weird trick to make Bitcoin actually work!

We're losing the DarkNetMarkets which is is the main reason Bitcoin succeeded.  Not Roger not Andreas but some of us who spent thousands of bitcoin over the years on DNMs.  Now we're shitting on them. 
Some of you might never have used bitcoin much but DNM use bitcoin AS A CURRENCY.   Call then whiners or whatever but they have been using it as a currency almost as long as Bitcoin existed and DNM and Bitcoin grew up together.  
Dream the largest DNM is about to implement BCH.  I fear others will follow.  It's easier to do this than implement Monero which is what they should be doing.  
I would support a blocksize increase to help Bitcoin's earliest and strongest supporters even if it just provides temporary relief until LN which they'd have to make changes implement anyway.

 Books will be written about Bitcoin Behavioural Economics.  A common behaviour cycle:
-  Bitcoin price anxiety, cash out
-  Regret cashing out while watching gains
-  Buy back in order not to miss out on further gains
Nothing to beat yourself about.  I think a lot of people have done this - I cashed out 50% myself before.  Take some risk of the table, know your risk tolerance, don't invest more than you're willing to lose and get back on the train.

It's both.  The value of satoshis has gone up and the the number of satoshi some people are willing to pay to get their transaction in the next block has gone up also.  If you calculate how much you paid for a transaction in January what was coinsidered cheap then is now expensive.  But to do a quick transaction now you might have to pay even more satoshi so it hurts more.  
This is why you Segwit is so important.

I bought it this week
- Slightly over 1 BTC in my Fidelity HSA
- About to buy slightly over 1 BTC into my Fidelity BrokerageLink 401K  (Edit Update: Fidelity won't let me buy this in my 401K Brokerage account)
- I have a Vanguard Account Roth IRA and created a linked Brokerage ROTH to buy but right when I was buying it said CXBTF purchase was not allowed at the time and to call.  
BTW, I think the price per share is 0.005 and you need 200 shares for a whole BTC.  This has been available in the Swedish Nasdaq since 2015 and they are purchasing real Bitcoin for your shares.  
-   Divisor shows 0.005 and x 200 you get a whole Bitcoin (Someone correct me if I am wrong)
-    Look at Historical Data --&gt; show more and you'll see that the number of shares thus Bitcoin changes over time and peak in December 2017
Think about how bullish ETFs will be.  It's really hard for me to get that cash liquidity to buy a whole Bitcoin.  But in my retirement accounts it's easier to allocate and  risk a small percentage of your portfolio.  Also the purchase is so much easier for normies.

Well Andreas.  In a way it's already happened. 
- GBTC controls a few hundred thousand Bitcoin
- XBT PROVIDER AB BITCOIN TRACKER ETN - It's been in the Swedish Nasdaq since 2015 and has 25K Bitcoin.
- I just got CXBTF which is the US version of the XBT ETN in my Fidelity HSA and that was a huge win being able to get actual 1-1 backed Bitcoin in a tax sheltered account
I think a lot of us would love to have Bitcoin backed ETFs in 401Ks, IRAs, HSAs.  Also, this is appealing to those for whom it's not technically feasible to buy and safeguard Bitcoin.  
*Why should Bitcoin be limited to only the technically savvy and why can't I have probably the best investment of our lifetime in my tax sheltered accounts?*

- There are applications for Bitcoin ETFs where the share price is going to be $200K
- Places like Fidelity which manages $7 Trillion in assets are building custodian services for Bitcoin (first followed by other digital assets)
Institutional money is coming for sure.  And it's...
- Coming to Bitcoin first
- It's coming slow as fuck, if you've worked in technology at banks and financial services you know how slow this is (these aren't some exchanges like Binance built overnight)
What this means is...
- People are dummies who are expecting to get rich in a matter of months
- You've got plenty time to accumulate, be patient.  You don't even need to throw entire paychecks.  
- That $800 Billion market cap is going to be a joke in 2030.  Like Novogratz and Tommy Lee say, there isn't even money in crypto yet.
- Bitcoin is going to be the first and most highly invested in digital asset.  You're going to look very foolish if you write it off.

If you think crypto is a tech arms race like it might be with innovation and marketing between tech companies, you've got it wrong. Bitcoin is a monetary phenomon based on technological innovation. But monetary value is all based on trust, brand value and network effect. That is a huge acheivement that is difficult to establishe and difficult to overcome. A better tech will come along every few years but this is not suddenly going to replace the established trust and network effect.

*  Koreans pumping like crazy, they did that with XMR put it at $150 got off the train
*  FUD created that BCH is going to come out the fork as Bitcoin.  They've spread this in lots of places saying this is what Miners support and miners have collected tons of cheap BCH and want BCH as Bitcoin (ie, Flipening bogus again). If Miners ever have enough power to flip the switch and make BCH as Bitcoin so that the cheap coins they mined gaming the system is the one everyone has to buy as Bitcoin and Bitcoin that everyone has been buying is a phony, crypto itself will come crashing down hard. Casual investors who brought this market cap to over $100 billion will flee and never come back as it'll be seen as a Chinese mining scam.
*   For those that want to speculate on BCH, I'd be careful about the Korean pump, the flipening FUD and also the fact that  173K of BCH being dumped on the market starting November 6th and ongoing for a 90 day timespan as GBTC starts selling its BCH.

I always find the most interesting thing about Economist articles the reader comments since they have a user based that is well educated and tend to have some background in economics/finance. 
**Comments from 2013 Bitcoin Article:**
* They sense the danger Bitcoin poses to the global financial order. They'll try to shut down the network, to discredit and slander Bitcoin. But it's too late. The cat's out of the bag.
We now have a way to make our own money. They can't stop the signal. 
*  Governments have manipulated the money supply since 1913 (Federal Reserve Bank) in the USA, and since I don’t know when, in the UK (Bank of England). Inflating the money supply is a tax on each holder of that currency and is deeply dishonest and ending those governments ability to do so is honorable and helpful. Both of the central banks mentioned are privately held and owned by a group of banks that are unknown to the public.
Maybe if the government was reined in we could use our computing power in other ways.
*  The Economist is the old-guard.....bitcoin is in the early adopter stage of the S curve. The smart money is buying while media tells YOU to stay away.
Instead of listening to rags like The Economist, how about doing YOUR OWN detailed research.
*  The bitcoins that are left will become more valuable for it. Each bitcoin can be divided to up to 8 decimal places i.e there are 100 million satoshis in each coin. So there will never be a shortage of coins or a problem of lack of divisibility.
*   The thing with Bitcoin is that you have to keep that old saying in mind and never judge a book by its cover. Bitcoin is ugly on the surface. You have to look past that and then you'll see the beauty of it.
Of course there were some people calling it tulips in 2013 and are still calling it tulips in 2017 but now they have comments such as..

*  Selling right before 10K and expecting a dip is risky.  It's possible that once Bitcoin eats thorough the sell walls, it's going to go nuts and you're going to have to buy in at a higher price.
*  I sold half at the China ban expecting a prolonged bear market like 2014.  I paid off half my mortgage. If I had HODL, I could have paid it all.  Either way, I'll never accumulate the number of Bitcoins I once had. 
*  I now hold the few I got in staggered time locked addresses not even trusting myself.   Hopefully there isn't a big network protocol change until the last of my coins are released in mid-2020.

I don't just want BTC as a savings account though.  Besides the DNM, the only places people can consistently use bitcoin seems to be VPN and domain renewals.  Even porn sites lack bitcoin support which is a really good use case.
The more widely bitcoin is directly accepted the harder it becomes to control.  If a large number of businesses accepted bitcoin, the threat of exchanges being shut down for conversion to fiat doesn't hurt bitcoin as much.  
A good option right now is bitcoin debit cards.  I've gone almost 100% bitcoin for non-retirement accounts.  This has really encouraged me to save since everything I spend is Bitcoin.  I should have done this earlier because the 1% return on high yield savings accounts is a joke considering the dollar is getting weaker -- I've paid Swedish loans for 3 quarters at around -2% and I owe more than I did last year.

Didn't we just have a fork with Bitcoin Cash? And miners are making money gaming the EDA and getting easy coins.  They might even see S2X as another cash cow to milk.   
And miners chain jumping between 3 chains is going to cause chaos with either one of the chains grinding to a near halt at times.

You joke but Bitcoin pretty much saved the US Escort industry after Visa and Mastercard blocked Backpage from using their payment networks during the last months of 2015.  
Escorts didn't have bank accounts or Coinbase etc, they started using Paxful to exchange gift cards for Bitcoin.   Maybe coincidence but it was exactly during that time that Bitcoin started consistently creeping up.   
Very few knew about Bitcoin and a lot of Bitcoin hodlers were making 30% or more selling Bitcoin for an assortment of gift cards and probably discounts on services.

I don't like the term that On-Chain is a settlement.  That makes it sound like LN transactions are not finalized.  
Once LN becomes the defacto way to carry out bitcoin transactions, why would you move your coins on-chain except on rare occasions?  
If I have a wallet, funded it and have opened some well connected channels, from that point on I could make payments, receive payments, buy more bitcoin all on LN in perpetuity without ever going on-chain.  You could not say that these transactions are not settled.  
And in most cases, why on earth would you want to go on-chain where the fees are more expensive and the transactions a thousand times slower?

As a developer with about 20 years experience working at big banks and financial services companies, I can tell you the crypto skillset is difficult and rare.   I don't have it and I don't have the technical background in some of the skillsets to work with it even if I tried to educate myself.
Programming, networking, cryptography, security, blockchain tech, etc.  It is HARD enough to find a competent developers for application development in high level languages where frameworks pretty much do everything for you.  
We're acting like crypto/blockchain dev is easy.  There just isn't enough talent to support all these crypto platforms and myraid ICO projects on each of these platforms.

If I am buying bicoin at Coinbase or Shapeshifting to bitcoin I expect to get BTC and not Segwit2X coin.  I think right now Coinbase would deposit Segwit2X and most users would not know.  Most users would want to buy the bitcoin supported by the Core team.  
If Coinbase is going to use Segwit2X it's important to at least notify users that this is an implementation of bitcoin that is not supported by the Core Dev team that had been developing it since the beginning and it does not have replay protection.

Sure BCH is the result of Jihan and the miners and they are gaming the system.  But there are BCH supporters who truly believe in the coin, big blocks, no-segwit, on-chain scaling, etc.  That doesn't make them idiots.  Just like believing in the technical leadership of Core, segwit and careful blocksize increase when needed, LN, etc doesn't make us idiots.  
You can argue a BTC/BCH fork was necessary.  There is no justification for B2X? wanting to keep his agreement with the miners!  You can't call it an upgrade when there is no development team to support the upgrade.  Add to that there is no user support.  People argue, 80% of Hash but that is just signaling.  Ok one cpu-one-vote but the hash will follow price.

A fork probably would kill Bitcoin Cash though.  Can't see miners spread over 3 forked implementations.  The whole thing is a shitshow and the only reason according to Eric Voorhees is to keep their word with the miners - the same miners who forked into Bitcoin Cash.

We want Bitcoin to be upgraded.  But how do you call B2X an upgrade?  It has ONE developer and NOTHING is being worked on.  It is just something pushed by an agreement between the miners and some businesses that think increasing the block size will solve scaling problem.  Bitcoin Core Development team developed Sewgit which has resisted for years by the miners and is slowly gaining adoption, this will alleviate a lot of the problems, effectively increasing block size as already shown.  They also have plans for off-chain scaling with the LN and are in favor of increasing block size safely and slowly as needed.

B2X is not a small cash grab project like BTG to make a little money.  It's also not an ideological schism like BCH.  B2X wasn't even intended as a fork.  B2X was intended as a way to Bitcoin off the hands of  Bitcoin Core development team which has been leading Bitcoin development and progress until now.  
S2X already has 1/5 the value in futures trading where the coins are labelled BT1 and BT2 for instance.  With the Bitcoin Core supported coin  remaining labelled BTC, who the hell is going to buy a forked alt-coin called B2X?  The price disparity is going to be huge -- Hashpower will follow.  At least BCH has an ideological, almost religious cult that will buy BCH.  B2X has no user support.  Other exchanges will have similar stances and some already have.  
So the miners last play would be to mine a coin that hardly anybody is going to buy (B2X) and hope the hashpower in BTC is so lacking that it grinds to a halt to kill the chain.  How likely is that to happen?  Miners will jump to mine the chain where there is millions to be made. If they don't it's economic suicide.  I don't think it'll come to this.

BCH actually had an ideological reason to fork.  Big blocks, anti-segwit, on chain scaling, etc.  They also actually have user base that supports that vision and will buy those coins.
B2X is the mining cartel and a few misinformed/misguided businesses trying to subversively take control of Bitcoin.  There is no ideological reason, no vision, no technical leadership, no development team and most importantly no user support.  There were people actually excited about buying Bitcoin Cash.  I've not come across anyone saying, I can't wait to buy B2X.

Cutting off nose to spite face.  A few weeks ago, there were anti-S2X comments saying that going against a S2X is something WE could all agree on.  But their hatred of Core seems to have turned them pro-S2X.
A S2X fork will probably kill off BCH because I don't see miners supporting 3 Bitcoin forks.  The support for BCH right now is just gaming the EDA system and getting easy money to dump - this will not end well with the downward price trend of BCH and 3rd Bitcoin fork.

**From May 2013**
- BTC +5000%
- LTC +2000%
- Every other coin - pretty much DEAD
**From December 2013**
- BTC has outperformed XRP and LTC and every other coin again is pretty much DEAD
**From June 2017**
- BTC has outperformed almost every coin in the top 100 I think other than XLM and if you look back the top 100 and top 25 have vastly changed from what they were 2 years ago.
Coins get hyped.  Coins will outperform BTC in shorter timeframes.  But over the long run, almost everything dies out or becomes irrelevant.   Even if they survive, it's hard to outperform Bitcoin in the long run.  One of the problems is that most of these coins are premined, have founders/developers rewards or most of the supply belongs to the founders.  Bad distribution and people keep getting dumped on for years.  Bitcoin has by far the best and widest distribution over the longest period of time AND the most growth as far as new users entering the space.   Bitcoin is more like a naturally occurring resource mined and distributed over time vs most other coins which are like personal chucky cheese tokens handed out by developers where they keep most of the supply.  I am not saying don't even own other cryptos/tokens but make sure you own Bitcoin if you are in crypto.

I am so glad I focused on paying off my mortgage in the bear market.  Almost there and hopefully paid up by the time it's time to stock up for the next halvening bullrun

This seems like a flash crash.  Coinbase being down probably saved people new to cryptos a lot of money.

The video makes it seem like BitCoinMagazine was talking about Breeze Wallet when it was it was referencing TumbleBit.  Totally out of context.  "probably one of the most promising technological advancements built on top of Bitcoin to date"...they took out the "Tumblebit" part that the sentence starts with!
Really could not find anything of technical substance or business value that it provides.   Also they talk about integrating Stratis with Microsoft Azure in BaaS but really could note find anything in Microsoft Azure Blockchain pages about Stratis where they name several other blockchains.  
Also, this guy seems to have done some very extensive research into Stratis which might be worth a through read through before you invest:

He might be a douche but I sense a lot of jealousy here.  "Fifty percent of baby boomers also have $100,000 or less saved for retirement" - USA Today.  Considering that he is 18 and has $1 Million, he has about 50+ years of the magic of compounding to be quite comfortable.
