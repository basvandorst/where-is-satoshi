Incorrect, only *Math* is acceptable.

Like Yoda, truly spoken it was. ;)

I’m not assuming in any way that all problems have already been resolved, but I also don’t think it’s reasonable to reject the fact that this tech which still going through it’s early birth pangs has already moved us light years closer in a very brief span.  
  Crypto currency / Blockchain / distributed ledger was just born !  Who knows what it will ultimately become.  Give it time ;)

So it could!

Any issue affected by the Byzantine Generals dilemma, of which there are a potentially near infinite number of.

I fully agree crypto is the future, but it’s worth noting that when you purchase a stock you legally own a piece of that company and have legal protections.  
When you buy a crypto coin, you do not own a part of that company at all and have no legal protection whatsoever.

Those examples are only just the first 3 that came to mind.  If you don’t see how centralized fractional reserve banking, counterfeit goods, or the current state of election systems have real problems that were they to be improved would have benefits to all of humanity, then I doubt we can have a productive conversation.  I’ll leave it at that.

This reply tells me you don’t understand the Byzantine Generals Problem.    The most common example would probably be:  How can we effectively decentralize banking.   Others:  how can you be sure without relying on a centralized authority that the new   brand named good you just bought isn’t a fake.    How could we solve the problems with voting over the internet.  Etc etc etc etc 
Really any problem where you are exchanging value and need some form of trust.   Blockchain moves the trust from a central authority (i.e a central point of failure) to a protocol, which is to say logic / math / cryptography.   Frankly I trust math a hell of a lot more than any human or group of humans who have been granted or claimed authority.

From 100 billion all the way down to 2 billion?  That sucks :(  /s
