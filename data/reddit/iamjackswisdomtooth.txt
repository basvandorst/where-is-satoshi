Agreed, I think we need to just get over it.

How is it your brand? Isn't it open source open license etc? Meaning I can call a coin Best Bitcoin In The World and you just have to get over it and worry about your business?

I think government registered bitcoin addresses being the only ones a registered company can accept is very likely. 
But that doesn't really change anything, it will be like paying by debit or cash, but instead registered bitcoin or anonymous bitcoin. Some large companies like Apple (just for example) will only accept bitcoin and smaller more local shops will accept unregistered because there is enough demand.
It goes back to the argument will the government gain more control or less in the future because of technology, personally I think the world is a lot smaller than we envision and we will find sustainable balance with innovative networks and technology before we create ww3/police state.

He made his point as clear as day, we should respect him, and leave him alone.

Totally understand your logic. Would be good to find examples in history of similar situations and see what happend there. Did beanie babies start buying second hand bears to create scarcity and drive price up? Lol jk just messing.

Agree, however a lot of cold storage will come out at 100k, that's pretty much moon for most holders and they would at least secure a large portion of that by selling and buying the billion dollar houses they can now afford.

You really are wrong, he is right. It may still need transactions on chain, but it definitely reduces the amount, which is the point.
