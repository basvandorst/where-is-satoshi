But I would have had $2,000 if I'd held onto them and sold when it was $1,000 a coin.

Yeah, I feel like a lot people have stories like this.

They're insured by the SIPC

I used to use VirWox to buy Bitcoins, but due to new regulations they deactivated all accounts of customers in New York. Do you know of any good exchanges which accept debit cards?
@_date: 2015-08-20 02:10:43
I checked and they can. Linden Dollars can technically only be used in Second Life, so the new regulations don't apply to them.

If it was staged, they probably would have made judge judy seem more competent.

Sadly no. I looked, but that was it.

I know that, but it's the main reason why banks are so evil. If the government were to pass a law making fractional reserve banking illegal, and declaring money in the bank still property of the customer, where banks would have to get the owner's consent to loan it out, then banks would finally be good organizations which are responsible with consumers money.

This is exactly what I'm saying.

Sorry, I didn't think it was a problem. I hope it didn't crash your computer or anything like that.

The entire show is a joke.

I honestly think health insurance companies just wanted a way to raise their premiums without people getting mad at them, and Obamacare gave them that opportunity. They simply raised premiums and blamed it on Obamacare despite the fact that they could have absorbed the cost by paying their executives less.

I'm tired of people criticizing Obama. He did literally all he could. He got health care reform passed, and even though it wasn't as massive an overhaul as people thought it would be, it's still better than what we had before. He didn't close Guantanamo Bay, but that was only because congress blocked the funding to shut it down.

I think most of these companies just used Obamacare as an excuse to raise premiums. They were probably waiting for health reform to pass so they could jack up prices without people being mad at the company.

I know, the worst is that a print out this powerpoint was given to me by my computer forensics professor.
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:44:24
I'm a college student at a college in New York, a printout if this powerpoint was given to me by my Computer Forensics professor because I'm writing a paper on Bitcoin.

Everyone seems to forget that the bailouts were loans. Almost all of the bailed out companies have paid their loans back in full, with interest. The government actually made a profit because of these bailouts.

I guess, but I honestly didn't think of that at the time of the post.

The way I see it, a bank is just a place to store your money. I see no reason why it needs to be this big complex system. Basically, an employer deposits money into an employee's account. The employee than uses a debit card to spend that money.
