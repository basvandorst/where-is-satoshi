Would you prefere paying 7 to 10% in transaction fee? Moving 300$ in BTC will cost you more then converting it... Just use GDAX... They don't have a fee for BTC withdraws... 
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:56:53
For this or general? But since it is not BTC it should not be that hi. 0.001$?
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:46:43
Not if you use GDAX... There is no fee
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:50:12


I would not touch them... They control Tether and from what I see they are printing it like crazy... And they are really exposed to it when it will blow up... I would not use any exchange that has Tether at the moment...

Reason is that at the moment real SegWit doesn't work. bc1 address... You have a fake one that is working at the moment. Some addresses starting with 3... And exchanges are not ready to invest work in something half done... or they would have to do all that work two times... It is not just implementing. You need to be sure it works without a bug or you might end up loosing a lot of BTC...

What is a statistic on lost BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:49:06
Well BCH transactions are up over 700% and BTC transactions are down 20%... So I don't think it will do much...
I use LTC to move BTC from exchange to exchange...
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:00:15
Well not really with such a low fee. Orphaning risk might be higher then fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:46
I used Normal fee 1 or 2 week ago... Trezor can't even increase a fee... I get no solution from them... Only it is not posible to do anything... If you go to Trezor sub you will see that I'm not the only one...
That is my transaction stuck and I can't do anything...
I know the fee is too low for today... But I can't do anything... I was transferring everything to Coinbase so I don't have any additional BTC on Trezor and I'm not ready to send any there...

Yes and no... this part of OP


@_date: 2017-12-06 18:42:57
Well it could be more then 0.01 since 0.01 is paid once per week. I had 0.015 that would be paid 2 two days... At that time it would probably be about 0.017....
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:23:37
Only if blockchain is not full. If it is fee are hi and it needs to be large...

**BIG WARNING!!!!!!**
For some reason I see that a lot of you think that you can't spend OP_HODL coins. **THIS IS FALSE!!!!!** v3 block can still spend them. See BIP65


New rules at 75% are only enforced on blocks v4 ore more... v3 is not bigger or same as v4.
You need 95% so all v3 blocks will get rejected.


@_date: 2015-12-15 11:51:01
OK please tell us about routing. Tell us about insurance Adam talked about. No idea? Good to know... And still less then 6 months away? Really? Will that be usable "wallet" or just protocol? How long for the "wallet"?
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:40:32
How. If goverment come and take controle also rented miners will be controld... only miners not located with them will not be...
@_date: 2015-12-06 09:42:15
Sorry to say but there isn't one. They can take controle if they would like to do so... Only miners and hashers that have hardwere with them can't be taken over...
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:25:29
KNC and Bitfury are 100%. Antpool did see about 10% drop when DDoSed. So lets say they have 85 in hands. Not owned but they can controle it. BW is also mor or less hashbank. Only F2Pool and BTCC are a bit of a guess...
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:08:39
Yes since they can make 51% attack by adding just "small" amounts...
So argument about mining centralization just went out the window... You can't make it worse...


I guess you are talking about centralization
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:13:59
So lets soft fork to 1GB blocks double every block. We can move all transactions off a block same was as SegWit... That is nice... Didn't know is that simple...
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:12:25
You do know what you just asked do you. I have no clue why is so hard. It just is for some reasen...
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:34:43
It doesn't work like this. Channel have expiry date. For calculations how many users can be processed with 1MB size they use half a year. I think this is tooooooo long. If someone scams you it would take up to half a year to get funds back. I think a week is more likely. So that is a first problem calculating number of users. Second is that small blocks will centralized LN. You will open a channel to big hub so you will need minimal number of channels. But what happens if that hub stop playing by the rules(hacked or whatever). Blockchain is full... How long would it take for things to get normalized? How long till you get funds back? Can you afford to wait? Will you use RBF and pay more for fee? How much more? Will you use BTC after that if you were "normal" user who likes credit cards?
@_date: 2015-12-08 20:10:00


Read this since this is important... Do you see anything about v3 blocks get rejected or tested for new rules?
@_date: 2015-12-08 11:20:53
What are you talking about? It is not activated. Only v4 blocks needs do be BIP65 valid. It is only 75% at the moment. When we will see 95% then it will be activated...
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:13:25
Well he was forced at 75%. And he was for a hardfork not softfork... So that is deployment...
@_date: 2015-12-29 05:46:30
I like the idea. Get all nonmining nodes on this and we are ready for any blocksize increase at the moment notice...
EDIT: no more BS we can't do it because it is not safe...
@_date: 2015-12-15 12:36:08
Guessing that is insurance... Right? So you don't know... I guess same goes for Elizabeth...
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:55:28
Read BIPs. BIP 65 uses BIP 66 activation  that uses BIP 34.
Just to be clear this are rules for BIP34 that changed v1 to v2. So replace 1 with 3 and 2 with 4








@_date: 2015-12-08 18:25:23
For v4 blocks but not for v3...
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:16:11
Totally agree. Just living of it is starting to get pain in the ass... Need to send much more then I would like to XAPO(not controlling private keys) so I don't end up paying 20$+ in fees... And paying bills using Cashila is also getting expensive since there is one transaction per bill...
EDIT: It looks like using bitcoin is somehow wrong since I getting downvoted and holding you private key is also something you should not do. So using centralized services is a way to go by the looks of things...

It is if you need it to be...
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:02:36
Yes I agree with this part. But if you use this rule nVersion&gt;=4 &amp;&amp; nVersion!=0x2000007 only for activation and not enforcement this problem is only hire from 75% to 95%. After that it would be gone forever... Unless we are stuck in a middle 75% and 95%...

As long as you get one in your currency is grate. If you travel in another country where they have different currency you do get hit with exchange rate. But that is every VISA card not just Xapo...
I don't like 6 conformation for any amount. That could be dynamic. And there are also some small bugs left that are not that problematic and you might not even notice it.
Exchange rate is good in a lot of cases. 99% of the time I can take money out at ATM and it cost me less then if I use BitStamp and I'm in SEPA zone...
@_date: 2015-12-08 07:27:51
More users, more different interests, more FUD, hadwaver devices that can't be changed and so one... 1MB was antispam and now for some reason is magic bullet that makes bitcoin works... Who knows what it will be in 3 to 7 years... And how would that be a softfork? It can't be... 4MB is a joke right...
EDIT: Are you talking about segregated witness? This is max 1MB block with one extra block of whatever size...

@_date: 2015-12-08 19:54:57
LOL. So you can't read too? Any miner will build on v3 blocks even if it spends locked OP_HODL coins till there is 95%... Go and read BIP or what I have copy/paste hire...

/s means sarcasem
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:36:27
No you just demonstrated that you can't read. Please point to me where I say you will loss founds. But there is scenario where you can loss them if blocks are too small. Big hub hack. Full blockchain and locktime expires... Than you can loss your funds...
SegWit is 1,5 to 2MB at best... So I don't see it as a solution... You can read FAQ can you...
Also channels from node to node have expiry date. I would guess that one would be even smaller since it will be for higher amounts...
@_date: 2015-12-15 02:11:12
Again not... Since XT now support BIP65 and would had to when BIP65 gets 95%. The only difference is that the way it was done XT had to support it at 75% and not at 95%. Biased on what I know I still think it was made that way just to add insult to the injury... Could be wrong but until I see a link from Peter I will not change my mined. Save way for SPV would be hard fork and that is why Mike asked for it... And core is removing a support for SPV anyway...
EDIT: I already had 2 core devs telling me things I know they were wrong and when I linked a code to show they were wrong I was just told that this code was out of date even if it was last published and not linking any code to show me that is realy the case. They just stop responding. Since then I'm really sceptical. I think this is a next case of that.
EDIT2: Unless you thought BIP101 activate before BIP65. In that case BIP65 would be on hold until Peter made it a hard fork since Mike would like to have it that way... Still not a problem...
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:44:36
OK I don't get why.
If you don't look for 0x20000007 after 95% any more I really don't see a scenario how would that make a problem...
EDIT: can you point me to the first mail...
@_date: 2015-12-15 14:04:11
BTW how do you know how hi fee will need to be. If uncooperative party will not use RBF and why would they it might be even low enough for network to remove it from mempool.

Fumy thing is that he has no clue that this is not moral of a story if you are not brain dead. He would make me buy Bitcoin right now if I would't have them. It went up from 6 cents to 36 and crash to 21 then go up to 21 $ and.... and it is now 241$... So moral of the story is that he is an idiot who made exact opposite point to what he was planing to do.
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:37:18
Sorry. Yes 104 is not size. There are so many right now that is imposible to keep up. But if we are talking about jokes there some other numbers that came to mind. 102, 103 and 105. Also 2-4-8. To some part 100. Not sure if it is best or worst of the rest... 32mb limit could end up be enough or create IPv4 problem...
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:58:49
Yes but it is not compression and optimizaton... It makes more not less traffic. But you do get 2 blockchains and you only need one if you are not miner...
And yes hard fork would make it batter. I already told Adam that I will not upgrade my mining node if it will be softfork a minute before I have to since not doing that would fork me of the chain... With hardfork you can make structure batter. See how hardfork upgrade will go and let conbase use for time when hard fork would be impossible....
@_date: 2015-12-06 09:58:41
No. But out of that 90% of hashpower i would say they have at minimum 70%. More then enough to pul 51% if needed...
@_date: 2015-12-08 14:59:35
Why? Block v3 will be rejected when v4 is 95%. And there is no if...


@_date: 2015-12-08 11:34:01


So blcoks v3 can still spend OP_HODL funds...
But yes I made a mistake. I was sure it is other way around... Enforcing rules for v4 blocks and activating when v3 no longer works... Would make much more logical...
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:31:27
So were is a 4MB blockside for witness limit? He is not talking about any limit. So it is 0 to infinity... I'm not sure how hi theoretical attack can get this but it is probably not only 4MB... Anyway without a code it is just guesswork...
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:26:20
v3 blocks are not validated for OP_HODL... Only v4

@_date: 2015-12-14 19:06:11
You are right... It is &gt;=4 so BIP101 blocks are included... That way Mike was forced to include BIP65 in XT even if he doesn't agree with the process it was introduced... If he didn't all BIP101 blocks could end up invalid since 75% adoption on...
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:51:53
Well you do know what they are saying. No blocksize increase for who knows how long and even then just a small one...
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:03:13
Yes but in that case it takes time. That is a point...
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:21:40
Even if you can't use it as a result?
@_date: 2015-12-01 06:19:10

@_date: 2015-12-28 10:13:24
None pays spot price of electricity in mining... It is price you get at distributor or in a power plant in my case. In my case that changes 1 time a year. Also price of Bitcoin has noting to do with mining without adding hashpower in a mix...
So price of electricity hashpower and price of BTC corrected by ASIC improvement...
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:15:23
OK I'm talking about one thing and you about another... WE AGREE ON WHAT YOU ARE SAYING!!! I will attempt that only one more time. After that I will call you troll.
Imagen all wallets set to Opt-in by default and 99% of the users don't change that in any way(for whatever reason). Is this still Opt-in or is as close as you can get to Full RBF as you can without using Full RBF and end to 0-conf? I have problem with anyone who would like to set that as default in any way... It is Opt-in so you should opt into that
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:50:29
Read BIP deployment... They are not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
EDIT: 
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:21:47
I thought you were saying I was wrong... v3 blocks can still spend OP_HODL. Only v4 are checked... So no milestone till 95%...
@_date: 2015-12-06 20:02:08
This has noting to do with SPV mining...
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:20:15
Not really... Only for activation. Unless you would agree with Mike for a different 0x2 number for BIP65 client... If you would add blockversion != 0x20000007 for enforcement all BIP101 block would be rejected... So not really a problem don't you think...
EDIT: For non technical. This rule would only be active from BIP65 be at 75% to 95%. After that the rule would be gone...
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:29:54
So am I right?
EDIT: I'm 99% sure I am but would like to add that 1%
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:27:40
OK. 2 friends is as close as you can get to one person without making it one... But one would be a bit worse... Unless you are talking about F2Pool have all hashing in there control...

Thanks! I hope I helped someone not get scammed since this is an attackvector of everyone thinks BIP65 is in effect... That is why I did not care how many - I get to my karma...
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:23:04
Only Mike as far as I know. And not BIP65 but deployment method used. Mike would like hard fork so SPV client would not get problems with hi number of forks where noneupgraded miner find a block...

I'm not that sure it is trustless... I think China pools killed that.


I don't agree that it can if you can't use it... that makes it useless and complicity without any value... If I need to wait for 1 year to get one payment... Even if it is censorship resistance 1 year will kill that...

@_date: 2015-12-01 21:37:30
OK now we are finally talking about same thing. Now do you understand what I was talking about. I have no problem with Opt-in as long as it is not default. And I'm worried that Peter is pushing it to be default. He managed to push Full RBF to F2Pool(luckily for only one day) and I don't get it why is he doing that... I see no reason to destroy 0-conf. If we would have a QR code ready that say no Opt-in it would almost be OK. But we don't. So that is attack on a POS systems... At lest give them time to upgrade to check for nSequence... For someone who is called to be really smart by so many people that is really stupid thing to do...
@_date: 2015-12-15 14:21:51


As far as I know it is not implemented and well you would get penalized so that why Adam was talking about insurance... So another fork we would need... 6 month???

The question is when will we have BIP101 blocks again... And will they be any easyer to setup for miners. Last time they added instructions just before they stop and you needed to change miners configurations. I hope this time it will just be a switch in dashboard...
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:23:46
If every transaction is Opt-in ?Full? RBF it is Full RBF. Opt-in has no meaning... What part of that is not clear? Trolling?
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:23:13
Well 100 nodes controled by one person is same as 1 ultrafest node.
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:50:37
Well fact are that everything I told you in last post could be. It is just not hi possebilety... And I do agree that BIP100 shuld not happen. Or any other BIP that would not remove blocksize limit or make it really hi so it is removed becouse of that. We lived with that for 6 years and nothing bad happend.
EDIT: How we get to that point is something I am ready to talk about but since it took that long to came close to maybe increasing blocksize limit I am not ready to have this talk again...

It is half that. 2 MB at best at 100% adoption and really hi multisig usage. If you recalculate current blocks is more like 1,5 to 1,7 MB
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:25:14
I don't. But miners started to ignore that transactions. Problem solved...
You have data from 0 to 1MB... I would say nothing strange or problematic happen... And we did not get 1MB from the start. We don't have full 1MB now 90% of the time... So we will probably not have more then 1MB average for some time...
If we would get from 1MB to 2MB simple I would agree. But since it is that hard I would like to remove this limit or get it so hi it is effectively removed...
@_date: 2015-12-08 20:04:55

BTCC always sends 0.001BTC to 1CzcTWMAgBNdU7K8Bjj6s6ezm2dAQfUU9a when they mine a empty block. This is accounting and if there were no SPAM send to that address they would know how many empty blocks they mined just looking how many transactions are on that address. But they can still see if the look at number of 0.001 that they send... It is just a bit harder...
Empty blocks are do to the way big miners are working this days. They have stratum, GBT, direct node... connections to each other so they can get blockhash ASAP. They then start mining empty block and wait for block to arrive. Then they verified that block and start adding transactions to a new one that is empty. If they manage to find a new block before that process ends the block is empty or in case of BTCC with 1 transaction that is accounting of empty blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:48:57
I don't think so since this data is irrelevant in pool case. They are connected directly not over 1000 of nodes. Even if I ran a pool on my connection I could push a block of 8MB to 4 biggest pools under half a minute. And pools should have a better one then me at home. If I would still live in a city I could do that on my old connection in 3 seconds. So really not a problem... And that is normal home speed connection in my country. And only miners care if they got the block they need fast or not. The rest of the network don't or if it dose for some reason can do the same as miners. But only one direct big pool connection will do.
Anyway my post explaining why this is BS got down-voted but it is based on tests on multiple pools connected at once and looking at new block announcement and facts from this article.

Not really... Would you like to see 50% 50%. I can do that in minutes... Or is there any other node that you would like to see gaining 10.000 nodes? And since about 12% of XT nodes were DDoS of the network would you like to see me drop numbers of QT nodes(well I would not do that but could be done)? I know it is probably not posible but what if 50% of nodes are XT in stealth mode? How many are QT+BIP101? Anyway with all FUD and saying XT died 8% isn't that bad. If it looked like it would succeed how many more would we seen? And that is just BIP101. What about other BIPs? BIP100 that is not even made or worked on would have about 60% miners support. I think we can safely say this metric is useless. 90% of the node could easily be controlled by 1 person...

No to stop spam at the time Bitcoin was worthless so users could easily download blockchain at start when this was the only way and should be removed when SPV wallet come out.
And node count is drooping since node is useless as a wallet to 99% of the users. At the start you needed node to pay now you don't.
And I like your ilusions. But yes we can always say reality has noting to to with what is happening... Blocks are too full at times. Not all the time but it is already happening at times...

No hardfork. If you do that it will no longer be a p2pool but altpool. Even if it will be batter this should not be done since it will centralize you and make running a node too expensive.

Yes and that is what I'm afraid of when I see Peter pushing something like that. Unless he is stupid there must be a reason. And I did see him do lets say "interesting things" to get his way... Is this signal to Coinbase and BitPay don't even think about BIP101? Who knows... It looks like he did use some interesting things to get pools to push for BIP100 day after BIP101 got big support from industry. And BIP100 has still all that support even now when it is clear that it was not even worked on. Unless that changed in last 2 weeks... And it is clear that core will not support it so it would need alternative implementation to work. I know this is all speculation and no prof but I really don't see other reason why someone would make that push that early on... It might make perfect sense when we will have LN but now not that much...

or weeks or months(depends on how full blockchain gets and how much you are ready to pay for channel). Unless that was a big hub then you would need insurance since there would be a lot of transactions dumped at once and your funds could still get stolen when locktime expires. Well not if they get stoptime or something like that to work  but your founds will get locked for even longer in that case... Depends on how much you would be ready to pay or in case of insurance how much insurance would pay...
But if you would increase blocksize those problems would go away...

What I'm saying is that Peter shuld agree for a difrent 0x2 number for BIP65 or not assumed that all 0x2000007 blocks are BIP65. This would work just OK if he assumed that 0x2000007 blocks were nonBIP65 till 95%. It would be more accurate and less dangerous... But I think it was done that way just to add insult to the injury... Anyway Peter did not respond. Not surprised. So I can add him to the list(with Gregory and Adam who also attempted this till they figure out that I can read code and also do some programming)...
EDIT: Mike also tell on a mailing list that he will not add support for BIP65 until he is forced or it is made as a hard fork not soft one... So he was forced at 75% not 95% or all blocks mined with BIP101 could end up orphaned....

First you do need to know that 8MB limit is not 8MB blocks. Like 1MB limit is not 1MB block. There are soft limits that worked in bitcoin thruout a history. And optimazation is happening in paralel. XT is adding them all the time to test clients. Like making mempool work faster. Creating blok faster. Setting spead limits in bittorent style not some geaky style. Geting verification faster. Decreasing chances for network to forget transactions when mempool is full... But to have them done and tested takes time...
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:54:54
You might be right...
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:46:49
It is not the longest chain. It is the one with most work. So if you have 3 dif 1(network difficulty) blocks and 1 dif 4 block diff 4 block wins. Longest chain is just simplification since splits and difficulty adjustments usually don't happen at once.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:15:00
First of all this idea is not new. And you would not believe what the problem is. It is such a stupid scenario that you can't think of it... I think it is BS to make bigger blocks a problem... In short the problem they have is that you need to trust your datacenter... And bitcoin is trustless... Well as long as 3 top miners are trusted...

@_date: 2015-12-28 20:01:28
No. It is much less then 2MB even with 100% adoption. 2MB is best case scenario. 1.5 to maybe 1.8 is with 100% adoption with blocks we have now. And it is more 1.5 then 1.8MB.
Anyway since it is that hard to get 2MB I'm not taking that as end of "war" it is not enough even to run LN. So unless we have a solution in place that will increase that 2MB without a new "war" don't think 2MB will end it... I don't care how it would be done as long as users or maybe miners can trigger next increase and the next and so on...
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:11:38
If every transaction is Opt-in ~~Full~~ Full??? RBF there is no 0-conf since it it Full RBF and Opt-in is just there. That is my argument... Not sure what argument did you see...
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:11:01
I call BS on this. Someone has a agenda or has no clue how Bitcoin network works...
First of all miners are connected directly so all data are wrong.
Secend we see that 100 kb dasen't take twice as long as 200 kb 200 kb not twice long as 400 kb... So 2 MB will not take twice as long as 1 MB.
And final one we see 1MB blocks now. And one 1MB blocks don't get noticeable more orphans then smaller ones. Just as experiment I connected my miners to multiple pools(also small ones) and new block notification in less then in 3 second on all. There might be some delay on putty connection as well... So even if we take linear increase in time for 8 MB we are talking under half minute.
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:37:15
For this to happen to me we would need 100Mb blocks... Not every home user has creapy internet. I have no problems with testnet 9MB blocks. I agree I would use pruning... Anyway XT has a solution that reduces blocks to 17% of the size. It is not perfect at the moment but it is getting there. And p2p protocol we are using is far from perfect and can easy be optimised. But till now there was no incentive to do that.

I'm not talking about that. If blocks are bigger there will be no retransmitting. And if the argument made against Xtreame  ThinBlocks is correct(That it only saves 12%) that means that it only reduces trafic from 10MB to 9MB. Or 11 to 10 depends to what you are calculating savings to... That means that the rest are retransmits... Get it now? Now I'm sure you will now point out that that is a BS argument and I agree with you. I'm sure it saves more then 12% and there is less than 8MB or retransmits so that is a BS argument to start with. So why was made? Why?
And well it could save a lot more then just 1MB. One 1MB on a way in and 1MB x number of transmits on a way out.

300$ VS less 30$ or 43.200 VS 3.928 per day...
Any i core processor that is now standerd has more then enough cpu power to validate 1 or 2 MB blocks and that cost less then 300$ for a full computer...
I can only say for EU. 10/10 including TV and land line(not sure what that is:) ) is only 40€. For additional 15€ I can get 100/100 and if I add another 10€ I can get 100/1G. And if I look at cost of electricity at 0.04€(price inside hydro power plant) 1 PH operation with S7 cost 9.400€ per mouth out of that only 40€ is internet. Or less then 0,5%.
For 2MB blocks I would not need to upgrade my CPU but I might upgrade the line. More CPU usage might add some power usage so lets say 1KWh(I know it is much less) or 0,04€. So cost would go up for 15,04€ or about 0,15%.
There are other cost like rent and work but they don't change(well they will with SegWit since I need to make more modification) and they are company secretes...
Validation is not quadratically unless you have only 1 transaction. That is BS put out by Core. And even then Classic and Core have 2 different solution for that... One for SegWit and one for 2MB... And also some other limits like 100kb transaction limit that is already in them that would in 99.99% of the cases stop that transaction...

Anyway I think I made a mistake. This is how core devs were defined...  And I see that that changed from last time I looked. Luke is included in this now... Maxwell was removed and Luke-Jr, Nils Schneider, Cory Fields were added...
@_date: 2016-03-14 07:37:19
I see a clam but no evidence... I see IPv4 addresses for thus hosted nodes. Unless you are talking about others I don't see...
EDIT: I see. You are talking about this  Yes for them I would agree... But there are also fake Core nodes there since they have no IPv4 IP...
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:12:21
Only if softfork happens fast and all wallets implement it and optimistic estimates are right...
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:41:27
Large? Small! Well depends of what you consider large. But 5% is not big in my book. I was at some point 0.something of the network and it was not big by any stranded. And if I were to activate all my capability(also ones with higher price of electricity) and replace miners I could get back to about 0.2%... And I don't think of myself as big or close to that... Even with 5% I wouldn't. It is not that much power or hardware. Even 90% that Chines miners would like is an overkill...
@_date: 2016-03-23 14:05:07
No sorry I am not talking about that. But if you say I am then go ahed. I don't care.

What about TheOtherCoin that just hit 1B?
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:23:03
That is not the evidence of that. It is evidence of you can put anything into blockchain if you pay the fee. He shuld know better and I think he does... EDIT: or he is cluless about bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-14 09:30:57
So I would say if core will not implement this the reason we can't have more them 1MB blocks is not decentralization(bandwidth costs) but something else... Hard drive argument was dropped some time ago...
EDIT: even if we don't get more then 1MB that would by there logic help decentralization in a massive way...
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:08:55
Well I do and it is a complex change to Bitcoin. Saying anything else is dishonest. They are right in this way. It is also a hack that can be done as SF but we are wasting space in BC if it is done that way... So I also think they are right in saying it should be HF. And that is the part I don't get... More or less anyone is for SegWit and we could test HF with it to see what happens. It would be better code that would be more efficient.
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:27:48
Well if you don't count in short blocks is more 95 to 99%. Short blocks will never be full. And they are in 90% of the time empty.
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:50:44
No core devs are saying July 2017 soonest not 2016... You are off by 11 months... And how would not be contentious if it is the same as Classic the way you are saying it needs to be done(month is really close to 28 days)? I don't get that part... Or you are just trolling?
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:30:19
What is the difference. The way you are saying it will work is the same as Classic. Point me to a difference...
And BTW you are wrong. Core devs are saying that soonest posible activation is July 2017
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:38:48
We don't know... But 1.7 is optimistic with close to 100% implementation. Even with 100% could end up only 1.5. So guess what if we get 70% we could end up with only 1.3.
EDIT: And since core is saying HF to 2 mb where you have to change only 1 number in any special implementation you might have or download new one would take 1 year... Well this is much more complicated and if they are right we are talking about years :) of course I don't think this is a case. But when we have a working Xtrem Thin blocks that compress blocks to about 15 times less and core devs say they don't work even when BU is ruining them now as default and no problems reported to this point you get the idea. It is not bandwidth or propagation problem since that fixes it. It is not storage since that is fix too for some time(can't say it is not working since it was in core). It is not validation since that is fixed to(in core). So what is a problem? Something we are not told...
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:40:00
Trolling? I'm talking one thing you are answering something else? OK test might not be a good word but sooner or later we will have to HF bitcoin and I think SegWit is the best way to do it for the first time.
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:11:09
Who made Core The One? Isn't this decentralized?
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:12:43
Yes that why he is manipulating. Even with blocks full and fee 100000000000....000000$ per transaction you could still do that. You would only need to pay enough...
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:54:08
Zoom out... Go to transactions... It is normal...
@_date: 2016-03-14 11:37:19
Yes and that is great isn't it? So 2MB for price of 1MB and less drooped and retransmitted transactions so maybe even 5MB for a price of 1MB... From what I can figure out 2MB blocks would result in less bandwidth usage without any optimization right now since we would not have retransmitting of transactions...
So I really don't get that argument...
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:01:00
Stop trolling? That could help. I answer you 2 times. I don't think I'm the only genius that see waist you have using SF. But if it turns out that I really am I will write a code when/if HF happen. Before that I see no way to show you short of writing the code... As I already wrote. I don't care if you see it or not...
And header is not waisted. It is just used... 0s replaced with data...
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:46:45
It is still linear. Classic have 1MB transaction size limit...
EDIT: Also SegWit but more complicated... + added relay limit at 100kb in Classic and Core. So no you are wrong...
@_date: 2016-03-13 16:06:14
Same argument can be used for every node.
@_date: 2016-03-26 12:12:55
So 2MB fork is not in roadmap at the moment...
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:58:08
You don't get it... So that would be you. And Nick is just manipulating... since he can't cluless
@_date: 2016-03-14 11:32:03
I'm not trolling. It was used as a argument before you could use pruning nodes... And I'm not saying it is HDD space. I don't think we know why Core devs will not allow it to increase but I don't think it has anything to do with arguments we know...
@_date: 2016-03-14 08:25:28
Yes a good way to split the community and create 2 echo chambers. Way to go...
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:31:13
This is just conformation that I was right that 2 mb HF is not in roadmap... Nothing more...
@_date: 2016-03-29 20:43:47
To fill a 2MB block today you would need to pay 11x more then for 1MB. If you have block naturally full block(90%) you don't need to fill it that much(10%) as a more then half empty block(10+100%)... And you would need to pay hi enough fees for that 110% to give users the same problem... So no BS that fees would drop...
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:20:22
So what. I'm right he is wrong and he knows it.
@_date: 2016-03-13 11:10:08
They do. They used to accept 15 now 125 to be as big of a target for DDoS as they can be...
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:32:18
No. Withdrawals were not halted for all the time manipulation by MtGox was going on...
Anyway you could buy a token at MtGox at the end that you couldnt take out. Same as Bitfenix tokens. And they were hacked to and they have one token already on sell... Why would any real user use them...
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:41:02
Oh... So we changed that already... What happen with bank being to slow and so on... Not bitcoin I was promised and sold... I can control gold to and it will be soon easer to move :)
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:07:12
Yes if they make a change that will fork Classic of the network...
@_date: 2016-03-05 07:45:49
Well last time I looked they were cluless what heppened. So they know now or is this just your speculation?
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:16:47
Yes. And there was a lot of talk that this is wrong if BU do the same thing... Not sure how is this different...
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:34:41
This is not a quote from the source... Where did you get it...
"If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017."
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:02:06
So only 60% for and 40% against. Luke and many others are not core dev. They are "core devs"... But if contribution is enough to get you core devs status this has less than 10% I guess...
@_date: 2016-03-13 10:06:00
Why would you have to filter out AWS nodes? I think it is much batter then some slow home connection that can't handle 1MB blocks. I used to have it home but now I'm paying for hosted machine that is immune to DDOS and help network much more... And don't give me some BS that you need to control your HW...

You are lucky it is not a big number. USB keys are not safe way to backup or store data. Next time make a paper backup...
For less then 15$ you probably will not be paying 100s or 1000s of $ to recover private keys... Look for programs that might be able to get data off your USB. As long as it is recognized by computer there is hope...
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:56:32
Agree I would be happy with Classic...
EDIT: With promise that if needed we could HF it again...
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:20:31
Well you can do that anytime if you pay the fee. You only need to pay enough so his tweet is dishonest since we can't say he as no clue how bitcoin works
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:58:17
Well not native English speaker...
No you don't get it...
Node one and node two have same block ready and are only waiting for hash(Bytes) from mining farm... So you are transmitting on every side...
But there are so many more things you need to know about mining. Look up Fast Rely Network for example. Than look at Xtreme Thinblocks. Then P2Pool. Than direct pool connections. Then fake stratum miner pool connections... there is a mash of connections and nodes that make sure you know there is a new block much sooner then 95% of the network... You might not know what is in it but you know is there and that is why you see an empty block from time to time. You start mining next block before you see what is in a block that was just mined. If you add any transaction in it that might be in a block that was mined block get rejected. So you wait till you get it, verify it and then start adding transactions in it when you know what is in a block. And if verification fails you go back mining on top of previous block.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:53:55
You do know there is a alternative to that right? SF&amp;HF&amp;magre mining*... So 1MB chain could be killed easily. You are wrong about this... I would suggest stop listening to propaganda and do a compromise... HF can be forced... Same as SF is forced by definition...
*SF 1MB so no transactions are allowed, HF unlimited chain to BU rules and marge mine BU chain off 1MB chain...
@_date: 2016-03-04 21:52:10
Still shouldn't happened... What if a miner hire runes a old code... Unless it was 51% attack...
@_date: 2016-03-14 12:29:47
So you didn't looked the video?
@_date: 2016-03-22 08:34:10
Yes but if you save some space in one place and waist more in another... And I never seen a HF be a part of core roadmap. You are talking about Round table and I'm not sure Core did accept it... It is more like some core devs and miners. I can't find approval by core but I didn't look it that much.
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:46:45
No it was not. Same happend with XT and OP_HODL. And it could be solved with nVersion &gt;= 5 &amp;&amp; nVersion != 805306368 to 95% and nVersion &gt;= 5 after 95%. No version bits lost and it even works if Classic devs add blockversion for SegWit...
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:28:08
Who is MP? Well in that case any argument that it is a longest valid chain goes out the window...
And you also forget that bitcoin miners have GPU farms to mine for ETH and I'm sure your old GPUs will not be good enough...
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:24:28
It is clear that you are cluless to what was in HK consenses...
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:45:10


I would not trust core for that. Not safe enough... All that needs to happen is a 0 day exploit and some monitoring SW added to your computer and your keys are gone... You need HW wallet or paper wallet...
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:18:51
So core dev make a pull request to Bitcoin Classic and they see core that made that request as save? That is as stupid as it can be...
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:11:09
Only for clients that are newer then 0.3.0. So you can't say it is not Bitcoin unless Bitcoin was not itself at that time:)
@_date: 2016-03-07 15:10:14
Well a lot users are moving out of Bitcoin so it might be something like that... I know a lot of them who haven't sell for years that are now selling...
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:01:02


You could do SF&amp;HF&amp;Marged mining. So even if it splits old chain is useless... You would need to HF it to work again...
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:02:21
Agree. And ETH cost now about 200% more and ETC is about 10% of original value. I see no downside...
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:26:03
Well you might look at Hitler history... You are talking myths about the way he came to power. Unfortunetly they are even in some history books... He was not elected. It was much mor complicated...
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:38:05
I don't remember any DDoS attack on core nodes made by XT or Classic supporters... But I might be wrong... Anyway just imagen if it were a separate chain...
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:12:35
But if you reject a SF with old rules you create a fork... That is my point...
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:41:51
Yes one node 100.000 IPs... Passes that test...
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:08:51
Short answer nobody...
Long answer. By definition that is sometimes used I'm core dev... But to get any meaningful credentials to you I need to change my mined to follow core team thinking. If I don't do that I will never get any change to make a meaningful contribution. So I'm nobody by Core definition... And I don't care. I don't think you will ever see more then some bugfixes in core from me... But you might see something in BU or Classic...
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:45:46
And I'm saying this is the same as SF... It is also forced on users... You can't opt out and use old rules... 0.3.1 client... 1MB fork...
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:23:41
There was a soft and hard limit. And it worked just OK as long as we did not hit a hard one... Well Luke was saying blocks are full of SPAM all the time and that soft limit shuld be 100KB at best but that is the only one I can remember. And as far as I remember he was and still is to many a joke... If you disagre he is then go and implement his HF system and drop blocksize to 300KB
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:28:11
So somehow we came from core saying split needs to be avoided by any cost to this when it starts to look like core might be on a loosing side...
@_date: 2016-03-23 08:03:46
Didn't seen this one... I haven't been on BCT for mounts now... Yes it is BS as far as I can figure out what he think he is talking about. I already told you where but you are keep saying ather things... I don't think I see a batter way of implementing SW with HF then core devs but you save space if you don't need to trick old nodes to work... You don't need anyone can spend part... I don't see a point of making a code for that since it will get rejected. It is SF but I will make it if I see it will be HF in future and core devs will not do it the way I would...
@_date: 2016-03-14 08:03:48
You have been living to long in a echo chamber...
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:46:12
Not if you have 51%+ hashpower... SF would be an altcoin in that case
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:39:24
Yes but 1 year grace period...
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:10:55
Yes but can I pretend that 0.3.1 1MB fork did not happened? Some are opt in but some are not...
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:28:04
So no argument just you are not worth talk to. Tell me why you think it is bad and I will tell you why I think it is not a problem for me... I might even change my mind if you have a good argument...
@_date: 2016-03-22 08:36:14
Yes and the only way to have a say in what is going to happen is to follow what they say. If you don't you don't have code to have credentials to have a say... So you get echo chamber...
@_date: 2016-01-21 08:47:00
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:20:00
So MtGox is OK in your book?
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:04:18
If that is unreadeble then I guess you don't know how mining works... So don't talk about it...
Node one has a block ready on one side of a bottleneck
Node two has a block ready on other side of a bottleneck
When you find a wining hash you push that hash to node one and node two. Hash is same size no mater the size of a block. So it makes no difference...
Now there is also a Fast relay network and P2Pool and direct connections to pools, Xtreme Thinblocks(on average 24x compression) but that is advanced staff... I'm saying this whole argument that bigger blocks will take out small miners is strawman invented by Core... Without upgrade my setup could handle 30MB without a problem and probably up to 100MB with minimal additional costs(about 1000$)... or just mine empty block for about 10 to 30 seconds with same equipment. Yes that is nothing if you look at other costs...
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:32:32
When you can't put out a contra arguments you start insulting... Nice... You should argue why I'm wrong not that I'm stupid and that why you win...
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:50:14
No. We were promised bigger blocks so I didn't. But if what Satoshi wrote doesn't matter... Well why would anything else he did matter?
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:26:00
Nope... I don't see a big enough hash-power change on Antpool...
30 PH... That is about 1% so at best that could drop BU for 1% and increse SwgWit for 1%. But it might be a old mining farm shutdown do to price drop as well... I know I need to shutdown my A1 and S2 now... I know they are old but if you have a hydro power station I could still make more money then selling electricity to a electric grid. Well not anymore...
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:10:46
Yes but if you look at size of L0+L1 you have more data. I'm not saying the extra is not useful but what is your point? If bandwidth is a problem(or has that argument now changed to something else) why add extra in transaction...
I'm from a country with a weary different sentence structure so I'm not sure what you don't understand...
I'm saying L0 SF to no transactions allowed
Add L1 as marge mine chain or chain with a hash of a block in coinbase of L0
Make L1 with unlimited rules
Add L0 history to L1
And you have a SF to unlimted size and a way to do safe HF as SF...
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:08:24
Nodes mean nothing... I can fake 100.000 of them today...
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:51:53
Not an option in Slovenia and not sure for UK. Anyway much batter option is CEX.IO
@_date: 2016-03-14 11:53:29
No you don't get it. I'm calculating retransmitted transactions that are drooped from mempool.
If it only saves 12% reduction as argument say it is that is 1 out of 10MB that you get per block. That means that network is retransmitting 8MB of transactions. 1MB for block, 1MB of block data and the rest is retransmitting... It works out to that. So with 5MB block you would get 5MB of transactions, 0.5 for block and probably no restansmitting. So it is not 10MB of data as a only 12% saving argument says it is but 5,5MB. But I was conservative and told you 5MB for a price of 1MB... So even 2MB blocks would probably clear mempool and we would end up with only 4MB usage without any optimization. But again lets say 5MB.
That is usage per block...
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:15:44
You might but majority didn't... And chain split is one of the reasons Core is ageist HF... To be fair the only one I see as one that is reasonable to me...

Edit: or I forgot that it already was 1st of April in China
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:49:59
No you just told me that I should have a problem with 2 chains but not not the reason...
Unless you are saying 25M is somehow a reason whan it is not. You have 21M of a BTC and 21M of an altcoin. Is BU or 0.3.1 chain a altcoin I can't say at this moment.
Or that price should be higher. Well it could be lower. That reality didn't happened...
I really can't see anything else that would be "I told you..."
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:31:35
Not relay a problem. You need 2 nodes on every side. You are making a same block on both sides and send a hash of a block when you find it to both nodes... That is blocksize independent. And you are also listening on both sides...
There are solutions just not told hire so you you think there is a problem to control your thinking. Small miners are not stupid or they were already out of businesses...
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:29:50
I agree it is dumb. But I was following exab logic to a point where it brakes and he needs to be inconsistent.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:21:53
I lost over 1BTC do to a bug in a 0.9.0... And I was probably not the only one... It happened about 10 hours before I seen alert on Bitcointalk.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:21:56
Well I arguing that it is same inflation as creating any other altcoin... Coins will probably never going to be the same they will only have a same history to some point in blockchain...
So by that logic you would hate me since I created a altcoin for me to learn how this works. I'm the only person on a world that have ever mined it but still... 
EDIT: If that is a logic there is no longer ony 21M coins but 26,25M (assuming bitcoin dominance at 80%)
@_date: 2016-03-23 20:42:55
If we can believe Round Table changes to roadmap they plan to clean SW at the time. So I guess they see what I see. If not I will made a pull request. So I do kind of planing to help if needed. But I'm the only one in a family that currently works and I have code and other computer staff coming out of ma ears to make enough for all.
Anyway I will made one last attempt. Also add another part that I think could save some space but I didn't had time to look into it.
To make SW work as SF go to 11:13...
Now this is a part I'm not sure and my understanding of English kind of limits me to what he meant by defecate signature. If there is still space left there it is loss of space. So if we had a HF we could drop it completely... With script-version we could then use old system and not drop it or SW or whatever we came with in a future and use a specific structure for any of them. That would save some space... Agree? But to be sure about that I need to look at the code... And have no energy left to do it... So the gains might come in a future.
Now if we look at output. It also has a unneeded part in a HF. Anyone can spend part that tells you this is ~~SF~~ SW could be drooped in HF... You just need script after that...  The rest is told be scripting version...
All extra data are defecated signatures(not sure if that takes any space) and Anyone can spend part of the output.
The rest of the data that are extra I agree that they are useful and I have no problem with them. Would like to see joined Merkle tree since you can do optimizations with multiple cores processors... But that is not a critical gain but if you have HF there is no reason why not to do it...
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:55:59
Market manipulation... It doesn't necessarily works like that... It could even be manipulated my terms and conditions or exchange itself...

Only if you are sh*ting on it...
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:10:21
As it will not be or no as something else? Like it was not 0.3.something client... I google that and it was 0.3.1 that changed that rule.
@_date: 2016-03-13 11:02:32
Well what is a difference if I make it or he/she/they make it for me? Just make the same thing for core if you think you need it...
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:12:36
Yes but that is not my point. What I'm saying BU only reject 0.3.1 client fork. It is still bitcoin. It only eliminates a fork introduced by 0.3.1 client...

You are buying at about 470$/BTC and credit card do the exchange. So probably about 480$/BTC. Spot price 433$/BTC.

You have no idea how small cost of internet are in a mining operation. I know. The biggest cost is a rent on a hydro power plant. Then miners. Then maintenance then we can start talking about internet at about 0.1%...

They are on week and strong side of a bottle neck and I'm using them to listen (and I'm using fake miners on pools, have some direct connections, Fast Relay Network, P2Pool...). The moment I see a block I start building same block on week and strong side so I don't get your point...

Centralised rules in one place...


Not sure what you are asking but this is a general answer. Yes if there is enough PoW there... And since you need electricity to run miners price of a BTC controls PoW and price is controlled by users... So not just miners...
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:24:27
Yes I can. If you ask me it was good. Price? Who knows... It might be more or it might be less...
I'm ok with anything that was in original rules. 25M was not... And only the chain with most work is bitcoin. The rest is altcoin that forked. In case of a blocksize it was SF in 0.3.1. But it is altcoin only in case it has less work then BU... And BU chain would fork back if it had less work then 0.3.1 chain...
You might not know that but Bitcoin forked with first halving... There was always 50BTC chain... I know it is not a good exmple since that fork was not compatible with original client and could not be considers BTC with my criteria but it did die since it didn't had enough hashpower and support...
EDIT: Did you edit your answer? or did I missed your last two things...
What lost resources? I would not call them lost. And not sure what you mean with basic economics... We don't know what DAO would do to ETH...
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:44:03
Yes I do. But it is irrelevant when looking at what a OP argument is...
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:25:39
That is BS. 2 reason...
If needed you can get it. If that was relay a case US wouldn't had any internet business...
All you need is to send out hash to a good connected node where you have put together a block that you are mining. That is blocksize independent...
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:04:50
Where? I don't see anything that would prove what you are saying... O you forgot /s in a title, right?
@_date: 2016-03-13 10:10:52
Well it is isn't it... Unless you would like to manipulate numbers then you can get any data you like...
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:48:05
It is... Look at this:
EDIT: 
EDIT: Read more 
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:23:40
Well first of all if they are my nodes they wait for hash from me... That is the part you don't get I guess...
And it is not just a connection. It is all the infrastructure... Like extra CPU speed, faster disks, RAM and staff like that...
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:57:59
It is... It was there for a perfect storm of 24 hours variance. Now it was overtaken by F2Pool... But 4 days is still Antpool... It looks like Antpool had about 70% luck in last 24 hours
@_date: 2016-01-15 10:25:37
That looks like magma...
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:23:19
Well this article is BS for sure... Classic didn't had that bug...
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:13:08
So now we are not talking about original client. And yes you are right it will not work without a patch to P2P or a translater for P2P. But that is all it needs...
So you are for what Sathosi told as to do? Not would/might
 
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    
  maxblocksize = largerlimit
EDIT: Or are you using custom criteria to fit what you believe?
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:50:12
I didn't. As far as I know... BU is not PoW fork and I pointed that out. It is in line with original client that didn't have any blocksize limit. Well it was limited by P2P message size. But that was 32MB... So technically it was limited by the max size of a variable...
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:25:26
Well client can process 32MB+. It is supporting code that have a probelm with 32MB+. P2P massage size. But if that is a problem. Well then I have a problem for you. P2P protocol changed. So if you would like to sync original client you need to fix that anyway... So no if something is limited by a size of a variable it is not a limit.


Have you ever attempted? How is a indirect democracy doing?
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:10:08
But original rules would apply to BU chain... I believe it was in version 0.3.somthing that it was forked to this rules... So for original client and many other it will be the longest chain...
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:04:58
OK if you are running a home operation you will connect to a pool and blocksize is not an issue. If you are a real operation you can pay to get that infrastructure... it is small cost when you look at other costs. Or just get a line that is capable to send hash to a node where you are making a block... It is just Bytes and it is size independent...
There is always a way... You might look at this 
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:33:26
SF&amp;HF&amp;Marged mining fork...
SF 1MB chain so no transactions are allowed, HF chain so you don't have 1MB limit and marge mine BU chain of 1MB chain...
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:54:56
OK so since BU flows all 0.3.0 it is not a altcoin as long as it has the chain with the most work... Hire you go...
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:55:15
With SF you can start ignoring rules at any time... That is because SF don't violate preSF rules..
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:38:16
I'm a miner and I know this is BS... It is just something you were told... bandwidth cost are far from a problem. Electricity cost and miners are the problem. Internet is 0.1% of my cost... And to get 10x more speed it would probably cost 0.1% more...
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:15:39
Where did I say that? All I did say it that SegWit would be something to test HF on...
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:16:40
That is propaganda talking... And with that kind of propaganda there is no way this can be solved...
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:25:33


This is from nullc(you can ask him if you don't believe me):
The original client will not sync at all, because the p2p protocol changed in 2012 (to add a checksum to the version handshake). You can gateway it over to the old protocol and then it will process the blockchain.
0.3 will accept the chain if you either adjust the bdb locks count configuration parameter or (last I checked) make sure it doesn't see any reorgs during the sync.


How do you know that? How did you figure that out? Did you ask every user and know how many will take BU as Bitcoin and how many wouldn't?
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:42:49
Why would anyone buy a token that expires by the end of a year and a thing that represent doesn't even exist?
But I have some tokens BTS(SegWit) as well. Would you buy them? They expire if there is no fork by the deadline... Would you buy them? 1BTC for 1BTS... No? Why not? You see why this price is BS now?
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:06:17
How do you know node is a node? I can fake 100.000 node realy easy...
Biggest wallet support BU
Do users of blockchain.info support BU?
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:42:21
Well you can't. But you can't validate it with original client. So it will never be the longest chain... But BU chain can be validated with original client... That is the difference...
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:14:30
You can't ask this hire since I can't answers... If I do I will get deleted or banded... But since Blockstream already admitted that LN might never happen for BTC short term solution is on chain. Extreme thin blocks have already solve any core argument that core had. I can't link to any of those things since it will be promoting alternative client or subredded...
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:36:11
I'm just using it differently to get something else. I know what L0 and L1 do in SegWit... 
And I don't buy into decentralisation and censorship-resistance BS... Unlimited size doesn't take way layer 2 solutions in any way... And even with LN we need 133GB blocks for anyone to use it... And if I remember right that is with 0,5 years channels... So blocking blocksize increase to no limit is stupid in my book. It will have to be done and sooner we do it easier it will be... And it can be SF down to 1MB again if needed...
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:51:45
Yes and your point is? What is the longest valid chain? Can you tell me that without centralisation of rules.
My definition is one where every block can be verified by original client. The rest of the rules are only there if they are voted in and removed if they are voted out...
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:14:28
Agree. I'm just saying that it is not the bitcoin network if chain with the most work has overtaken it... It is an altcoin created with client 0.3.1
EDIT: Same as any other fork we had...
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:25:03
So how would you move coins to exchange if no transaction is allowed on a network?
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:13:16
See that why I made a clear one. The only clear definition we have before we got "core devs" that is whatever it needs to be...
@_date: 2016-03-25 09:50:15
Thanks... I know I'm not the best to explain things...
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:00:26
Yes but we have no idea what segwit will do since it is not down to miners... So it could end up as 1mb or at best 1.8MB and I did indicated that if you would read forward...
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:12:59
Well not. It is not the longest chain as such. It is a chain with most work. But since chain with most work is the longest unless you change difficulty code there is not difference and you can say the longest... But in case of a fork that will no longer be a case... And we will have to say chain with most work...
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:22:29
You don't know much about BU and plans it has. But that is not strange since it is not allowed to talk about it hire. Go and use google... BU has "segwit" plans as well as layer 2...
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:59:42
Original client at this time is not able to sync. And this is this way for a long time. As I told you P2P was changed and is no longer compatible. So I'm OK with changing supporting code...
No more like enough space in a block all the time without a problem and miner can increase a blocksize if needed...
@_date: 2016-01-28 22:05:56
That page looks like it is from end of 90's
EDIT: And it is below forum quality writing...
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:15:06
Nope. 0.8 has only a problem if it see a reorg...
Yes but now we are again from rules to something community is saying. So OP argument is destroyed my your argument. If community say BU is Bitcoin...
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:04:25
Better question is will core force Classic to use SegWit as it did with XT. XT blocks in last OP_HODL fork were used as votes for BIP no matter what XT code was so XT miners had to upgrade at 75% not 95% as the rest of the network. Will core use the same tactics again...
EDIT: Yes they will force Classic to support it... Every Classic block will be vote for SegWit...


@_date: 2016-03-14 05:55:14
It was at the time... EDIT: and it is again by a big margin...
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:45:46


Well if you could do e2e encryption in supporting code I have no problem with it... And I guess this is something you can do...


But what is the same? Sometimes not changing things change things...
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:38:44
Who knows... There is a lot of propaganda but almost nothing that can't be ~~say~~ said for Core at some point in time as well... And when you have so much propaganda you get division that will take time to end. So I guess we will not have a stalemate for a long time... So for bitcoin to move pass this propaganda must stop...
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:54:32
Why? That new to me.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:58:12
I know what SegWit is... And if I would say lets SF L0 so no transactions are allowed and have L1 as unlimeted marge mined chain or have a hash in a coinbase... Is this something you would support? It is same as SegWit isn't it...
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:20:50
I thought we are talking about 21... And politics will be involved in everything. Even animals have that...
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:28:28
For a client 0.3.0 there is no rule change to BU... So if you ignore everything to 0.14.0 there is no point of change. And as long as a chain has more work there is no reason not to ignore that... 
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:15:30
Well for BTU there is a condition in futures(Bitfenix) that they expire at end of a year. So you will lost them if there is no fork.
And I would do the same for BTS tokens. When SF expires they are gone...
Now tell me why would anyone buy them at full price?
EDIT: The only one who is sure to make money is a exchange that sells them at the start... If you buy them at the full price...
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:45:25
Why not? Show mi a hole in my logic... At what point is a line from original client to BU broken...
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:18:28
They plan to implement something close to segwit. That why I used "segwit". They have flexible transactions as one option and simple HF segwit as a the second option...
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:12:48
Like that one will not get attacked... Just look at all DDoS XT, Classic... have suffered... Slush got forced to shut down Classic mining for weeks...
EDIT: and if we look at SF process. It is a same one as 2 two steps Peter is talking about... It also orphans blocks that don't signal SF before it activates... And a step 3 that orphan any block that is build on "old chain" with old rules...
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:47:52
BIP91 ~~is~~ was activate and is now inactive. NYA is also using bit4 and is still active. So bit4=NYA not BIP91

@_date: 2018-06-03 07:36:12
So you are saying it is implemented but not implemented since it is not merged? I don't get it...
And I wrote as it is not as it will be... or are you saying you can support 5.000.000.000 people? That would take 50 years if we would just opening channels and nothing else... If nothing else that makes it impossible... But I would guess we would hit problems with tracking balances of channels long before that...
EDIT: and that just solves initial sync problem...

Well disk is from 2007 so it is posible...

I asked the same question at but not get an answer...
Are we sure about 140.000 KW number? I have problems believing... That is 10% of what my whole country is using...
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:27:33
No... This is stupid... If it happens it will not happen with 3.1 MB since EB will not be 3 on a miners side. And miners will make sure that EB is big enough and that EB will have 51%+ power. Unless they are stupid... So what you are saying will never happen... It will look more like that...
50 blocks - EB=2MB, Cumulative hashrate 2,5%
1800 blocks - EB=3MB, Cumulative hashrate 90%
150 blocks - EB=5MB, Cumulative hashrate 7,5%
But even that is a risk for miners so it is more likely to see all of them to have the same EB size... edit: and the network will set EB for real...
1. No hardcoded block size limit.
2. They will not let it happen...
3. Well they can do 51% now. So what has change?
4. Not sure what your point is since whole idea is stupid...
5. Assuming miners are stupid yes you are right... But again. Same can happen now...
6. You are right you don't understand it...

If you can sync original client to the network I would agree. But you can't can you. At lest 0.8 fork is a problem... Read a definition of a hardfork. I don't care if it was a bug or not. By definition it is a hardfork.
I know I sew a list of forks that included 2 hard ones from Satoshi time...

What TOR DOS is doing to XT nodes is that is asking for a big old blocks that are not in memory so you need to look on a disk. So weary little traffic is necessary to stop node operating...
And it is not block. They might get drooped if you get DOS. But when dos stops they can reconnect. So much batter then FW.

51% anyone?
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:02:00
How. That way we will never have to see this debate again. Blocks will never be 8GB unless there is a demand for that and miners could handle it.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:14:26
You say 75% is easy?
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:20:00
Good luck on this one. Not sure if parallel universe where this happens even exists. MS Apple and Google would need to include that in default installation. Unless you make it same way as early BTC did. The only option to use BTC and/or LN.
I do plan to run one of them. OT and LN(same as I run BTC, LTC and DASH nodes) but that is just because I have more then enough CPU diskspace and RAM on my server and live in EU(good internet). And well I have lease hydro power plant to power miners and that server too... Hell I'm CPU mining on it for DASH. It is not costing me much. So I don't think there will be a lot of users like me to run it just because they can...
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:15:42
OK so we use corporation instead of conglomerate. It is written a bit different but it sound about the same. So Google for examples international conglomerate in English? We would just call it a corporation if we were referring to all the companies around the world or a company if we would referring to the one in our country. I guess that comes from the fact that there are states in US and it is complicity different situation...
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:35:57
Yes but that increases value of 8MB BTC from 56% to 100%... And 1MB is only 6,25%. So 51% make seance... There can only be one...
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:36:10
Yes but they can't set same limit to the rest of the pools. But with this BIP 25% can set hard limit to 8kb...
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:13:34


I would call that an attack...
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:52:08
Nope... If I get a QT with bigger blocks and reasonable dynamic limit I'm all for QT. But if I make QT with BIP101 and run it it is not saying big blocks. It is saying small blocks. So XT is currently the only node to run and I'm using it to push my agenda... XT and QT are more or less the same and differences are small.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:09:58
Yes I'm reading it. But I can't see any argument that is not BS or speculation without any data or something I can dismiss. But I do see a lot of things that worry me. Like proposing fake XT nodes to block XT...

Why everyone assumes that the moment we will have 8MB limit we will have 8MB blocks. We had 1MB limit and we did not have 1MB blocks... Miners do care about orphans and will not include every transaction out there...
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:49:17
70% of the one who gives a cares... The rest couldn't care less... It is just a number. They would care if BTC stop working for them.
And why 30% could dictate 70%? To change constitution you only need 66%...
And there are different level of impotence. Coinbase or BitPay is more impotent then user or small pool. And miners will look at big players so you are right. They will go with economic majority but I would say there will be also big part of users.

@_date: 2015-08-18 17:43:11
Well yes if smallblockers play dirty game... But you would need to fake 25% of hashpower... I don't see big pool doing that. Only p2pool nodes...
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:27:48
Well I would call that attack as problematic as the one my node is getting all the time from TOR. Request for old blocks. Just some additional work on a block would not change things... It is not that CPU intensive... But if there is a new vector it looks like you are keeping it secret even with davs asking about it...

To get 51% there must be something wrong with core or current process so this isn't that easy... 8MB XT would need 75% for example...

2016 January earliest... But hard to say when conditions will be met. You need 75% of hashpower and then you start 2 week countdown...

So KNC supporting BIP101 blockade BIP100 and f2pool supporting BIP100 blockade BIP101
So if this is Peter again as he was with  he found good way of blocking blocksize... That change by f2pool made bitcoin more of a settlement layer but by doing this you manage to make it even more so... Removing SPV clients is also on the way and was even suggested doing it in LTC... 
So really I can't see why someone else doesn't see this as a problem...
Freeze blocksize [in progres]
Make it easy to double spend 0 conformation transactions [supported by f2pool]
Disable SPV clients [proposed to BTC  and proposed to LTC]
What do you get by doing that? Settlement layer...
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:46:54
Pool name?
To this moment you can support only BIP101 by mining on the right port(a lot of new miners probably don't know that since it is not in help) on Slush. Pool hashrate more then doubled but I guess most miners pointed miners on default port.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:21:23
This is not adoption of BIP100. Article if wrong. They are mining version 3 blocks. It only shows they changed there mined 3 times already(F2pool) and if the speed stays the same they will change there mined 9 times to January 11th...
@_date: 2015-08-25 09:55:39
So KNC supporting BIP101 blockade BIP100 and f2pool supporting BIP100 blockade BIP101
So if this is Peter again as he was with 
Good way of blocking blocksize... That change by f2pool made bitcoin more of a sentiment layer but by doing this you manage to make it even more so... Removing SPV clients is also on the way and you even suggested doing it in LTC... 
So really I can't see why someone else doesn't see this as a problem...
EDIT: This are not BIP100 blocks. Version 3. Article is complicity wrong... This is just a signature not BIP implementation... So what we just learn it that f2pool changed his mined now 2 times...
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:17:18
Well network affect...
If we have 75% to 25% split you will have 75% chain that is 56% of current value of BTC and 25% that is 6%. So there is a insensitive to put 33% hashpower of the 75% bitcoin to attack 25% bitcoin. You get additional 10BTC per block that way. If you split hashpower on chains you only get 15BTC of original value. So 51% anyone...
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:12:02
Give me a reason to open changetip account...
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:11:12
8 big players that are not exchanges or just miners... So way to use BTC as a currency not something you trade on exchange. All wrong... Yes that is the case for sure...
Sorry but I'm really loosing my trust in devs. Look at this 
And when you will not be able to use P2P android wallet but you will have to trust a node by developers of that wallet remember this... I know you need to trust a node in this case but you are connecting to a random one... So no central point of failure...
But I must say. This blocked any change in blocksize unless someone changes there mined... This is what you do wham you know you can't stand your ground on arguments. Make multiple options to stop the change that needs more then 50% vote.
It was clear that blocksize will change and now they are doing it impossible to make a decision any time soon.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:56:11
Thanks I was looking for a way to help make a first XT block. My pools support 8MB blocks but will not upgrade to XT soon enough for me. How do I use your node to move my miners there...

It is not factual
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:07:54
Yes and if 1MB will not die in hours after it will be killed... For get a 44% increase in value you need only 33% of the hashing power of main network...
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:21:03
Agree. You could also be leaving in a virtual world and you don't know about it... You just made wrong conclusions on your data...
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:51:36
Really? Are you sure. They will be on altchain and unless attacker was the first transaction you used Bitcoin with since fork you would figure out that something is wrong imminently. And even with the attacker conformations times should be a clue... You really should be clueless for this to be an option...

@_date: 2015-08-18 16:26:35
Nope. For this be a factor 25% of hashing would have to do that. I don't see big pool doing this. They have ASIC and that would cost them... Only miners on p2pool... Noneissue... Too small. But that shows what kind of people are out there for small blocks...
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:23:17
Well EU has more then 100x more in this time... I had 20KB(not bits) download and 5KB upload 10 years ago... Now I can get 1MB+ download and upload for same price. And can get even 1/1Gbits line for reasonable price(less then 150€)...
And I don't believe you that US had no change.
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:37:26
It will not get there. That is my point... Fell free to test it... But no changes to the code...
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:32:42
So this is your interpretation not really what is written... I though so. English is not my first language but I was sure I was not reading it that way... So 21% attack is posible after all...
What I'm afraid is that there will be no time to implement new BIP... and this is only a blocking maneuver now that big blocks are more or less done deal... Not the first time F2Pool was manipulated to make something like this...
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:02:13
OK. Opewrt is for HEX miners from 
So I guess punting S1 to S5 on would be a challenge... Will see how that goes...
Minepeon is runing BFGminer running a variation of a Klondike. Will just test that.
SP20 will work OK then...
Coincraft I will just test...
And yes I use hydro to... Leasing power-plant... And if you decrease voltage on S1 it still makes more then you would get selling that power...

I give you this to a point... But for people who 1$ is fortune will not run a node. It is to expansive to them at the moment... So why plan for them to run them... If it gives you a benefit OK but it doesn't give a benefit to most users at the moment...


It was invented as a alternative to current one and be p2p.


Hope you are right and it is not 2 more weeks...


You might than edit wiki... 


Every presentation I sew was talking about a server that process transactions. I know there will be more then one but server is centralized and you need to move on a difrent one if it will not process your transaction... It can't take your BTC but it is still centralized...


Not what I'm saying. If you would have to run nodes over Tor do to governments any central server can be found turn off or DOSed. And ask DPR how good Tor is...

@_date: 2015-08-18 22:31:49
I not sure it is a small group... I would say at lest 70% of users would like to see bigger blocks... But if it is a small group then there is no need to worry. It will not happen... Miners will not change to XT if they think none would like to have bigger blocks...
@_date: 2015-08-15 08:11:27
Well I don't agree. I agree we have more miners. Even if we don't know unknown we know it since there were and are IP listed. We can also say that miners(pools) didn't had own hashing. Now some do have it. That means that they don't need outside hashers as much and outside hashers have much less to say who big pools are. So hashing is more centralized. But I agree. We don't know if number of hasher is higher or lower. But do you count someone with 1 ASICminer 333MH USB stick the same as someone with 10TH or 10PH? Percentage is also impotent... and decentralized part is smaller for sure...
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:57:53
Depends on what you would call a change. If they do anything outside the rules that most nodes are using they would fork themselves. But they can still do some damage inside the rules. But that is not really protocol change.
And it would be visible, expansive and useless. So only theoretical example... It is like cutting off your feats and arms...

@_date: 2015-08-14 05:02:04
Only miners make blocks. And this is a block size decision. Who else is there who makes blocks... It would be extremely unsafe to stay with small chain so even if users stay they are exposing themselves to 51% attacks and slow transaction... But please do present a counterargument not just words... I might miss something...
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:15:20
How long it takes you to download 8MB file? When download starts I have it in about 8 seconds. If I would pay just 10€ more I would have it in less then a second. If you have dial-up network don't run a node... And only miners needs blocks as fast as possible but they are no longer using node network to get block data anyway...

Isn't that making censorship of some kind? And making network too expansive for a lot of users. And isn't one of core properties that is cheap to use.
I pretty much call BS on all this centralization will happen... This makes centralization. Coinbase ofchain transactions, XAPO ofchain,... it makes a lot of banking problems...
But yes 1MB will decentralized Bitcoin into altcoins...
And to finish up. Luke-jr idea to decentralized mining with changing PoW is something that I really hope that the rest of core devs aren't really considering. To him is less controversial then 8MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:05:07
I was not talking about miners with 51%... But miners are security. Would you use a chain that has only 25% of the power. If miners would like 8MB and have 75% they can and will 51% attack 1MB chain do death... So you are wrong...
@_date: 2015-08-26 08:05:47

It is permission-less so it doesn't matter what you think or feel since you can't do anything about it.
But I think it would be good. All free publicity, giving legitimacy to technology show users how to use it and then lets show them Bitcoin... The next step will be simple... That why I don't see a snowflake chance in hell for this to happen.
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:37:50
Expansive to a point that is only theoretical... First of all you will never know when you will find a block and best you would get on 1 conformation is 1000$(I guess much less). How much is 25BTC? It will never happen that there will be someone who would double spend 1000$ and lost 7500$...
EDIT: And "SPV" miners were not SPV mining. Do you really don't know what happened? You really should know what big pools are doing...
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:30:29
102 is 2MB right? I can tell you it is. And miners(well I did and there are evidence that big pools did too) have ad some SPAM filters so I don't think we need a limit to protect against SPAM. It could be short disruption but not a long one. The network adapts... It will stop relying on that hard limit and add automatic soft limits. There will be small miners that will ignore that but there is a balance with orphans and size...
@_date: 2015-08-29 23:55:32
Now I need to find all the "specialists that knows all" that told me that we don't need to increase block size because of LN is coming out at the start of next year. And that OT will be out Q3... I think we know that none of this will happen now... Q3 is over and LN is not coming out at the start of next year according to this...
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:06:47
Yes I agree...
You know what would be badass. Implementation of BIP100 and BIP101 together in XT. BIP101 block counts as BIP100 as well. First threshold reached wins... That would increase chances...
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:21:40
Someone mined XT block. Any idea how to figure out who?
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:33:00
That why I said doesn't help much... And I don't see a problem in my lifetime....
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:36:19
Yes but not the same way as users would react. Fee were low and it happens for limited time... There was also some spam filtering done by pools so some transactions were drooped. Including some legit. One was from my pool that worked day earlier... Imagen now what would happen if attack(since we can't call that a stress test) used higher and higher fees. It could stop the network. With bigger blocks that would cost way more since amount of space he will need to fill will not be just 8x more. Why? To get things simple lets say we have 75% full blocks. He needs to fill only 0.25MB with hi enough fees. To stop a network at 8MB he would need to fill 8,25MB or 33x that. So it would cost 33x more to pull that attack.
EDIT: spelling

If it is regarding a fork not dying it will get killed by slow transaction and low hashing power that can't protect it from 51% attack...

It is not. It is waist of time... Unless you can explain why. There are soft limits so I really see no point of having hard limits...

@_date: 2015-08-02 22:41:43
For this to work Parcoin would need the ability to produce and destroy BTC or other altcoins. I don't see how you would produce it.
Just make a mental test. You sell 2 BTC at 250$ and get 2 Paracoins. Coin must now "destroy" 2 BTC. BTC is now 125 and you would like to get 4 BTC for 2 Paracoins. Where do 2 extra come from?
That why you need counter party for this to work. If it is market you have no guarantees that it is 500$ and you can't make it so it will be EDIT: "unless you make it same way as BitUSD or NuBits". Best posible way is BitUSD or NuBits where you buy and sell a pegged coin...
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:36:52
Double spend with higher fee would be nice. F2Pool has as far as I know replace by fee policy...
Send from multiple accounts. Phone account and Trezor for example...
EDIT: and thanks for all your work.

@_date: 2017-11-21 10:04:52
There are the same as making one after you make it... Well until difficulty changes that is... If you haven't yet make one then you are looking at odds of making 2 blocks but the moment you create one you are looking only at odds of making 1 block... Block you already made has no impact on odds...

@_date: 2015-08-18 17:39:34
By this logic every time Blockchain forks(orphan block) you have twice the amount of coins... And since there is about 1% chance of a fork you have now 77.790 millions. But one dies so not really... But you could stay on any of them for some ideological reason...
That why you don't have 42 millions Bitcoins and that is my point... You have 21 of something and 21 of something else...

Just = now not 2013...
And attacker did do a good job. But it has noting to do with bloom. That would not change a thing. Just block requests making my node full. I drooped of a network... DROP rules had to be added to FW... So that is something more serious than bloom...
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:29:12
No BIP100 from what I understand takes away top and bottom 20% and then takes lowest agreed value.
What that is I have no idea. If someone can make an examples or pseudo code...
Miners vote by encoding ‘BV’+BlockSizeRequestValue into coinbase scriptSig, e.g. “/BV8000000/” to vote for 8M. Votes are evaluated by dropping bottom 20% and top 20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen.
What is this most common floor (minimum) is chosen. What is minimum? How do you get common floor? Is this the lowest that has more then one vote? The one that has the most and how is determinant? By pool? By hashrate? What is the vote in this context?
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:04:54
25% will realy not be safe... So no I don't think you would have even 25% at the time of a fork. It will not happen when 75% gets on XT side. It will happen 14 days later. And I think we would see exodus from weak chain. So I don't think there is a big chance for it not to die. And I'm sure that there will not be too many exchanges ready to risk 51% attack on weak chain... Or they will ask for much more then 6 conformations.
EDIT: and yes since value of bout coins will be less there is a big reason for miners to make sure there is only one.
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:39:24
On no... I thought BIP100 was a big-size blocker but now I'm even more sure... 
What I don't get is why you need to take top 20% off. They don't make any kind of a deference. Can someone explain that part to me...
The secend part I don't get is why bring back 32MB limit. It is not historical anymore. It was a size limit of p2p message to save ram(first client was made for NT/2000/XT) but was moved to 2MB since there was a 1MB cap on blocks... So why not just removed it and if you are worried about the size make a dynamic max limit that is going up with time...
P.S.: NT had a min of 16MB ram and max of 4GB... So clearly not needed anymore
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:54:33
By 2020 2MB? Is that the one? 2GB at 2063? Yes really radical... And really we have smaller and smaller private pools to avoid block withholding attacks so I really don't see it. You mean by country? Or less and less home miners(hashers)? Block size will not change that. Changing PoW will not change that. The only thing that would change that is a way to get electricity and miners at same or lower cost then big miners.
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:40:50
Give you total control and all responsibility. If it is updated you know transactions are valid. None can spay on you(more or less) and control or stop your transactions. It also depends what type of online wallet are we talking about. Do you have keys or not. If you don't you don't control your money. That type of online wallet could be hacked or run fractional reserve system. But you do need to know you might get hacked too. You are just a smaller target but there are pros and cons.
If you would like to run a node just run it but don't use it for hi amounts. For that you could buy a Trezor or use paper wallets... I hope there will be something added to a core to use this...
@_date: 2015-08-12 06:55:24
It is probably you who is doing that. I will give you a clue. 0.8 fork. Go look at it. It will stop there if not sooner...
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:02:21
There was no SPV mining. Someone call it that who had no idea what it was and it stuck. To understand what happened you need to know how miners are doing mining this days. So stop this BS... I will give you a clue. How many transactions were in so called SPV blocks? Only 1. If it would be SPV mining that would not be a case. It was a bug in something miners are using to start working on a new block of any size in less then a second. They have additional mash network of mining connections(same way as workers on pool) so they can get hash from block that was mined by pool. And when invalid block was mined they didn't drop it after some time(that was a bug). They were building invalid blocks on it and waiting for bitcoin network to get them that block so they would see what transactions they need to remove from mem pool then verify it and start putting transactions in new block. So they were just missing time-out. A bug in new protocol that came out...
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:43:20
Economic majority isnt the only thing that matter. Miners provide security they can argue that the value is where the security is, BTC may end up on its own chain with very little hash power leaving is open to a 51% attack. Its not as simple as you may think.
If we have a switch there will be 75%+ on XT
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:19:00
You have 1MB BTC and 8MB BTC. 8MB has 75%+ hashpower... Guess who will get killed and why...
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:30:48
Hm... They stopped. They mined only one block...
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:31:29

Well you care about Tor and I care about using it for 1 $ transaction. You know how much that is in parts of Africa?


Depends on how you look at it. It is/was for 6 years... So it is a Bitcoin property. And it is P2P network not something centrally controlled...


Yes but this is what we have now. How far are they off? Are they centralized?
Open Transactions (a centralized transaction system) is complementary to Bitcoin...
I can't find same quote for Lightning but we all know it has a central server...
So if you are saying we will need to run nodes on Tor this is not a solution.

Well first of all there is no webmail there. So I guess this should be first clue.
Than you see invalid certificate from a VPN provider. So I would guess this is one of there dynamic or static IPs they are selling. I see no other reason why would that page that be there if that is not the case... It doesn't look like that still offer any kind of mail services...
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:19:14
Without a valid certificate... Yes armature hour...
And he can prove his identity. He has one of the 3 keys for Bitcoin alarm and maybe keys for early coins...
EDIT: thanks that helped a lot... It looks like this page is controlled by secureanonymoussurfing.com, and no mention of a mail service... But we do have VPN service...
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:05:20
It is important since it can be easily fixed without any performance penalty. Fixing SPV mining has performance penalty. I guess they already added something like this:
Work on new hash
If no new block on a network in X time then
 drop hash
 work on old block
 If verify block is successfully then
  add transaction to new block
 Else
  reject block
  work on old block
 End If
End if

That I would really not advised to use for hi amounts. Online system is not safe. If you are running node you have or should have port 8333 open. Hackers see that and know there is a good chance you have bitcoins there... And if that is a general purpose machine that runes your windows(I hope not XP)... On no...

I know what you think happened and what should happened but did it? It was not BIP66 style problem...
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:12:21
It is more then 15TH but one worker are less then 100GH and biggest is less then 2 TH
Anything I should know about Antminers, Coincraft desk, Minepeon and Openwrt miners?

No I'm saying that is already happening in my life. I don't use fiat anymore and need to use LTC in same cases...
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:21:14
A hardfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade.
Download original client from 2009 and do your best to get the chain without changing the code... If only consensus is the problem you should be able to... without changes... Good luck I see at lest one problem but probably more...
@_date: 2015-08-27 08:38:50
It is like voting for republican or democratic president before you know what who it is. But a lot of Americans do that too. They are sure to be voting whoever he/she might be... Stupid but it happens more offend then not and it is made on ideology...
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:32:18
Same as BIP101 or BIP102 or "BIP103" or any other BIP on size...
EDIT: Now I get what you are refering to... Well when BIP takes blocks made with wrong version number will no longer be valid. So you will have to mine with right BIP but could use whatever soft limit you think are for you. If you don't adopt BIP you are running a risk to fork yourself even if you fake version number...
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:10:56
Do you by any chance using BCI desktop client we don't know of and you found MtGox coins? 404? :)

I'm not sure how can you see number of hashers with this. You can only see pools that are mining. And hashers are just that. They hash for a pool but you can't count them from this. But from what I seen I'm sure that hashers are declining. And if you call hashers miners then so is the number of miners. But if you call mining process creating a block pool is the miner and everyone is a hasher that is just doing hashes for a pool... So you could call hashers a big decentralized ASIC and pool the miner that is using that ASIC. And hire we defiantly see a centralization happening... I'm the only one out of my friends that still hashing since I adapted and lease a hydro power plant to get cheap power.
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:04:39
Not just direct conections but paralel mash system where they get next block hash long before they get block.
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:59:04
As far as I know coinbase votes and public coments makes:
Antpool, F2Pool, BTCChine, Slush, BWpool, 21 inc on that side. That is more then 34%... More like 70%+
But they didn't all say that they will run XT. Some would like devs to make QT with 8MB...
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:57:02
Well you are wrong 
See blocks are BIP101 and not XT. Only cores are XT since they are saying they are Xt and not QT. You don't see QT+BIP101 hire.
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:43:05
Please tell me what can happen with 2MB. I would really like to know. Not even Tor gets effected... 2MB is nothing today. My computer takes longer checking for viruses then downloading that...
@_date: 2015-08-12 06:58:16
To increase value to BTC. Just look at FTC... PoW had to be changed...
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:00:19
How? I don't get it....
What makes 3 3 5 5 5 10 = 5
What makes 2 2 2 4 4 4 = 4
What makes 6 7 8 8 8 8 = 6
EDIT: OK I think I get it for increase and decrease but not stay the same... Why first example doesn't change it to 3 or 10? First one smaller then current size and last one bigger? What if they were 3 4 5 5 5 10 or 3 4 6 6 6 10...
Also are you sure this is right. Reading how it is written doesn't sound like the method you used...
EDIT2: Smallest change wins?
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:17:53
I'm still a zombie since I only manage to sleep for 2 hours but you help me to focus on my work today... Yes the only size limitation I see is overflow ones... The rest are self imposed... And calling this a historic limit is stupid if you ask me. It was already changed to 2MB so changing it back to 32MB... What worries me is that this moves it far enough into the future that it can get into IPv4 type problem...
@_date: 2015-08-27 10:43:53
Sorry what? Every BIP will have a block version number if that is what you are referring to...
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:34:42
OK it was slush
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:38:29
I would say they have more rights.
They have money. If you don't have it you have no rights. I know theory say differently but reality says I'm right...
They can kill people with there actions and they don't get jailed or destroyed(people do). In most cases they only have to pay a small fine.
They can live forever... So dose copyrights...
And now right to encrypt...
@_date: 2015-08-12 06:51:31
OK I get it. You think that 1MB would go on... Dream on. It will die or be killed to get back to 100%...
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:31:32
Not sure. There was a XT block but now we see core blocks coming out...
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:19:14
It will make them 10BTC per block to attack it... So yes...
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:37:46
If you are referring to 8MB fork and can't be bothered at looking what is going on ruining XT would help. If we fork it will work and if we don't it will work...
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:16:08
How that works? Do they have some other stratum addresses for that?
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:02:02
No it didn't.
Older clients then 0.8 still have this problem. And will not sync...
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:18:12
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:21:25
Something was forged but it could be a proof of forging as well. And in any case v7 or v8 they ware not honering the contract. I would guess they figure out they lost a lot of users and give in to some deal. Just look future contract. About 60% of what they were. I'm also sure there is alot of fake data. Since every China exchange is saying that competition is doing that.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:38:51
No fees are not the target. Disrupting competition that might have let say 25% of activity and 10% network power... Let say that they change 6 blocks with empty blocks and than mine some empty blocks for about 1 hour. If that doesn't help make a bigger fork...
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:01:34
In addition to blockstream you might look into chief scientist of Viacoin... That is also conflict of interests.
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:43:47
Or 20%... It is not clear. And it kind of makes them collude...
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:57:43
Yes but running XT also shows devs we would not like to see IPv4 upgrade problems... How much easier would it be if that upgraded happened sooner... Well I'm not sure if we can even say that it happened...
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:51:17
You do know that vending machines don't use and probably never will use core and if they did that the guy who supplied it will inform buyer or will even made an update. But for now BitPay take care of 1 or 2 in existence...

But if that is the case I'm really sorry.
@_date: 2015-08-27 08:35:41
You are wrong. It is also hard fork. That means no compatibility...
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:49:15
You just need to change a flag in config to stop node from droping TOR connections when attacked with DOS from TOR. But I would advised you not to do that. If you run TX you get a lot of DOS from TOR...
EDIT: Just adding this: 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:19:48
Well that only show that you know what a code dose. Not what implications of it are. Two different things. And I think they changed there mined since they were told that loud and clear... It would never happened that fast if that was not the case...
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:35:44


Every server is centralized service. Same as Coinbase, XAPO,... You probably don't call them competing nodes right? You are replacing more then 6000 nodes with probably less then 10 big central servers... There will be a lot of small ones but there will be centralization problem as it is now with pools exchanges wallets...


Agree it doesn't have them now but that is just because it is not working. It will have some big ones that if you shut down you stop Bitcoin for some time... And not all servers will have same rules as it is a case with BTC. So you only need to shut down or block one you do not like.


What about a bank that needs Tor protection because of government? Really good one? I think not...
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:36:03
In case of F2Pool I would say it is thing of a moment... That is there 3 option that they support.
Anyway from what I read I have not mistaken anything. Article is wrong. And that is it...
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:59:18
Yes since it is completable and I would see when it would stop being one plane so I could get on a bigger one that will not crash...
And open source protocols also get forked... So no I don't see a difference... There are protocols that were forked... One example is IPv6... It is probably not open source but do you say we should not fork it? All the mass we did to stay on IPv4 and at the end we had to hardfork it... Same as bitcoin but we can do it sooner so it will not be that hard...
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:33:25
Yes it means something else hire. Multiple LTD in multiple countries connected in one large international monster...
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:25:36
Well you also have multisig so two times more... But that doesn't help a lot...
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:34:28
Any code can be changed in any way... So saying it can't be used for that is a lie. I can always make it do the thing you say it can't. So how it that an argument...
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:13:50
You do know this shows smallblockests in really good light...
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:39:20
BIP number please. As far as I know 8MB is max... Unless you are talking about future... And well I think I can handle that(32) as well. Probably much better than Chines pools.
Let ma ask you a different question. Do I need to assume 51% attack too? By Bitfury, Antpool and F2Pool? Or any other combination that give me more than 50%? We did see more then 6 blocks generated by one pool and nothing happened. Yes we will see full blocks from time to time but nothing will happen. It will be more anomaly than businesses as usual.
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:05:24
Are you sure? Because there is a good chance you are wrong...
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:28:46

Yes but when fork happens it will be exodus... And you will not be able to get forks back together again... There is no way... You really don't know what are you talking about... Why they fork they fork...


You don't need node for this... Just make a paper wallet. You can then spend it with 90% of light clients. And I see no issue with that. Even if you are somehow on LTC network you will not expose any sensitive data doing that. You will just need to resend it on the right network... So not sure what are you saying...


If you are concerned about that you are dealing with big amounts of money so it should be worth to you running a node. Upgrade internet to be safe or hosting solution for 1MB and 8MB node cast the same...  If you are afraid... BTW. Do you have your own DNS list at home? Would you like me to tell you how a theoretical DNS attacker could empty your webbank account? So you really should have all DNS addresses at your router... The problem is that this theoretical attacked are expensive and make seance only where they would not work unless you are an idiot.


As long as you control the keys sending out with light wallets is really not an issue. And if the amount is big enough for you to need a node you would have no problem running a node since you are loaded...
@_date: 2015-08-02 09:53:37
Have you read BIP 103? 2MB by 2020...

Also certificate on that website is not valid for vistomail.com so it is probably not even Vistomail server. Anyone knows if Vistomail still exists or is accessible? DNS change?
EDIT: Also if you look what some are doing...  hacking is not out of the question...
Not Bitcoin XT
This is a special fork for those who do not agree with the blocksize scheduled increase as proposed by Gavin and Mike in their divisive altcoin fork, "Bitcoin XT".
This version can be used to protect the status quo until real technical consensus is formed about the blocksize.
This version is indistinguishable from Bitcoin XT 0.11A except that it will not actually hard fork to BIP101, yet appears on the p2p network as Bitcoin XT 0.11A replete with features, yet at a consensus level behaves just like Bitcoin Core 0.11. If it is used to mine, it will produce XT block versions without actually supporting &gt;1MB blocks.
Running this version and/or mining with XT block versions will make it impossible for the Bitcoin XT network to detect the correct switchover and cause a premature fork of anyone foolish enough to support BIP101 without wide consensus from the technical community.
It prevents correct detection of Bitcoin XT adoption in the wild since usage will be known to have been tampered with and thus all statistical data gathered by getnodes can only be considered unreliable.
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:18:07
Well I asked my pool long time ago how they will vote so if you care about it you are already on a pool that represents you... if not it will not matter...
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:20:42
I'm small miners(well by a big pool standards but big compeer to home miners that are using pools anyway). I have 100Mbits/100Mbits that cost net to nothing if I look at electricity cost so that is BS argument... It cost 70€... If I would like to get 1/1Gbits I can get it for 120€... I don't have electricity bill but lease on power-plant is 2500€...
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:20:30
To what?
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:55:20
If it will be anything but really small there are big incentives to kill it.
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:08:59
Sorry I meant 7 not 5... But thanks it is clear now.
Are you sure that is implementation. If so I guess it is OK. 21% is not posible... You need 80%... So that is OK in my book than... We just need to get only one BIP... But problem I have with BIP100 is 90%... I don't see this happen... BIP100 will probably failed BIP101 but failed itself too. 90% is too easy to block...
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:09:53
Well I think I have batch 1 or 2. And I can't make it work. Unfortunately... So only about 12TH from me :(
Also some of the HEXM and HEXR are crashing...
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:30:19
No I'm not. Miners are lifeblood of the network. They can do whatever they like. They can censor transactions, stop network, enable double spends,... and there is not a lot you can do about it in a promisesless network... But if you know a way to force miners to do something they don't wont to do please let me know.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:16:46
Any way of seeing what the reword is and hash-rate? Workers?
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:44:20
25BTC at 100% = 25 BTC
25BTC8 at 56% + 25 BTC1 at 6,25% = 15,5625 BTC
So 10 BTC more in relative value...
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:55:39
Who cares if it is XT or QT+BIP101 as long as it is BIP101... Or anything that makes size bigger and not static...
@_date: 2015-08-02 20:47:59
Sorry but who guarantee 500$ value? What is logic used... Central authority or same as BitUSD? This is first time I heard of Parkoins and Google have problems finding it... Sure it is not a scam?
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:51:20
With only 25% of a hashing power it is not safe so even if it will not die it will be attacked to death and exchanges and payment processor will live it... So it will really not be worth risk. One big pool can 51% attack it... You know why did FTC change POW? Yes LTC miners... Hire will be even bigger reason to do it.
@_date: 2015-08-21 12:11:54
Yes it works for me. Next day on my account... As good as it gets...
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:09:31
If XT is altcoin so is Bitcoin an altcoin. It already had some hard forks so if we use this as a reference it is as far as I know 2 generation altcoin... and XT would be 3 generation.
Unless for Bitcoin to be a Bitcoin you need to run the Core. Than we need to start saying we can't fork core devs even if they destroy Bitcoin.
If we fork core devs with XT then XT will be Bitcoin and nothing else. Core will be forkcoin... or oldcoin or whatever...
Edit: See that chinawat beat me to punch. I was looking for a list of forks...

@_date: 2015-08-15 22:53:10
Your coins will be on both forks if you had them before the fork. But one would probably die really soon.

@_date: 2015-08-02 21:14:06
Sorry but are you talking about altcoin or idea for one?
EDIT: If it is not the idea it sounds like a scam...
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:58:14
Yes but that is only 21 and 21... You can't say you have 21 cars and 21 bikes and that is 42 cars...
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:06:31
If it is useless... You need like 200 conformations or more... And there are empty blocks mined to block transactions?
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:12:13
Well according to Luke that was a hard fork and it will not...
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:52:41
Yes but if limit is 5 than what? Stays the same?
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:15:24
Right... Like you can't implement it on XT. It only works on QT...
I hope I'm wrong but I really don't see it that soon...
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:54:20
Yes but the big difference is block size. The rest of the changes doesn't do anything that would fork QT. And only XT nodes are counted. If you run QT node with BIP101 you can't see it as a XT node... It is a QT node...
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:02:26
Not really... They did that already... But there was peer review by core devs of BIP101 so it is pretty safe to say it should be OK... If it wasn't they would use that to stop XT adaptation...
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:00:13
Thanks! Will update as soon as it is out...
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:16:14
You don't when you say miners have no say in this.. This is a problem why you don't understand what I'm saying. They can destroy any chain they don't like any time they like... Even if alternative chain has 90% of activity but only 25% of power and the rest 75% of miners decides that they will have a different blockchain and stick with it that will be the only safe chain... I know it is not likely to happen since everyone knows that 75% of miners is something you need to follow as long as you have at lest one big exchange and wallets there...
@_date: 2015-08-26 05:20:05
Now you know my frustration... But I was lucky enough to fall a sleep about 2 hours ago. So I did had some sleep... The problem is that this will now bug me whole working day and I shouldn't look at it...
EDIT: Ohh I was to sleepy to figure out that EDIT2 was the answer... I will be really efficient at work today...
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:55:03
Well I agree but number of BTC costomers will be low at the moment and it would work out I guess. When this number changes so will number of places accepting them...
But I must say I can live more then OK of BTC in Europa. Xapo for buying in shops that don't accept BTC(more or less all unfortunetly) and Cashila for paying bills. Cash only is the only problem and in this case someone else needs to pay for me.
@_date: 2015-08-19 07:14:50
Yes but they stop mining XT blocks. After that block there are QT blocks :(
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:31:32
It is an open source project. This is a normal process you should know about... I call this as BS.
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:58:58


Depends on your definition of technical expertise...


Years is hastily???


What makes them so impotent? Commit access? Number of updates?


Why are you so sure about this?
I was always told if there is something I don't like in Bitcoin it could be forked. So why this is no longer the case? Was that a lie?
@_date: 2015-08-13 08:09:14
OK another core dev that say otherwise
You need to patch it...
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:55:14
I would really like to see a pool that supports XT. Over 50% of my miners don't play well with p2pool so I can vote only with about 12TH.
If anyone is interested in mining on a XT node.
EDIT: That is not meaning I would not change to core if there was a way to say increase block-size with the core edit2: but make it dynamic...
@_date: 2015-08-14 19:46:49
Yes if we make a distinguish between hashers and miners. If not I would not agree.
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:13:38
Not enough data to tell. If you would like a minimum number is 2 to be distribute... Would work with one. So this are technical limits. Also you didn't give me user data or connection speeds so the rest would be a guess... We know we have more then enough nodes right now even if numbers drops for 10x so no worries there. And if problems appears there will be users companies and pools that will put up good nodes. So really don't see a problems.
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:15:15


So lets make a change so we see if we can then make a change... OK sounds stupid but I guess there is a small change with consensus there that is not with the real increase present. But as far as I know there is no consensus even on 2MB. I would like to see an addition that could change limits without another hard fork. It can for all I care work same way as Bitcoin alarm system.


If you are not ready to relay on a past data this is useless since it will be past data at the time of next fork. Bigger change would also help to see more clearly what happens. So useless.


Agree with this one to a point. Put a dynamic limit in. Don't care how you raise or what algorithm it starts it just put it in. Why hard fork Bitcoin again. I do not won't to see this debate and 100 BIP on size again. Do something that avoids this in the future.
I'm all for big blocks, LN, OT, sidechains.... We need all this and more. But would like to see core changed first since it will get harder and harder to change because more and more people will need to agree.
EDIT: So you see no danger in 2MB. That is what I was talking about.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:46:02
Yes and that was change on a Chinese proposal...
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:40:46
You are not geting it. If I fork I need 51% to still have a Bitcoin. Altcoin is useless. I can live of BTC even with all problems 1MB blocks are doing for me right now including forcing me in use of centralized services. I can't do that with LTC or DASH without using Shapeshift that gets me back into Bitcoin and all the problems that it has. So even with 1MB it is still better then much better made altcoin.
EDIT: for now...
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:34:55
Yes but can you tell me how voting will work? Not for sure...
How long betwen the votes? No!
You also know things republican candidate will do more or less. Same as democrat...  Do you get it now?
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:00:57
Nice and simple but useless. We need something that can increase limits in the future. I don't like this war on size... Something dynamic. As far as I know there is a presentation that say that even if everyone would use lightning network we still need 133GB block size if everyone on the planet is using BTC.
In addition I think making 1000 proposals just make any difficult since vote get dispersed and some might even be made to stop any change... This is a grate example of someone who should just make changes to BIP 100 and not make a BIP 102...
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:58:56
No 51% attack is a lot of attacked that can be done with 51% of the hashing power.
Empty blocks
Selfish mining
Double spends
Excluding transactions
Excluding all other blocks...
So no this is 51% attack you are talking about...
But for the blocksize. If they would not take the smallest but the average after removing top and bottom 20% that would solve the problem. But I guess author has a problem with too big blocks. And that is why we will need another had fork to change 32MB limit... Stupid...
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:16:31
Than 90% of users should not run a node... Old node is a problem for SPV wallets. But that is not the case... See nodes versions. So I call BS on this...
We will not go to 8MB. Now we have 1MB limit but not every block is 1MB... So why would you think you would see 8MB all the time? So BS again...


NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO... ROTFLOL... That is really not the case... If that was the case we would have much more nodes. Like 1.000.000 not less then 7.000. And no it is not because it is hard. They don't care...


Agree and it will happen...


I don't plan to accept 1MB as 90% of economy if a fork happens. Not safe enough. So they will die... And there is a lot of insensitive to kill it to...
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:44:54

For filtering SPAM we need something batter. This can as easy block legit transaction as it can relay SPAM. We need to  include other criteria or people will find themselves not be able to send transactions that worked days before... Bad antiSPAM is even more dangerous than SPAM.
@_date: 2015-07-21 07:53:33
I'm talking about big vs small miner and how 20MB blocks would effect them. Small miners do get less mining time with 20MB blocks(or any size blocks for that matter) but not more orphan. And as far as I remember that simulation was done without any optimization like SPV mining until verified or anything else that miners are doing...
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:07:21
Miners are security. 51% attack anyone?
@_date: 2015-07-10 18:51:48
Yes but I don't think Greeks have any savings... Andreas talked about that...
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:29:48

OK I will agree that I might be reading it wrong but I still see that you got paid by government agent? Or am I wrong about this to?

That is not given. It might have a higher bandwidth. EU might have home connections that can be batter than China datacentres...
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:48:11
Well something you can think to add down the road... I'm not saying you need any of them in first realise but those are things I'm missing in XAPO... But since with XAPO you don't need app to confirm the paiment the bar code cards are not an issue since you only start one app. But with you is a bit different and could be more practical...
For Trezor you could look at Mycelium code. It is integrated and open source... So no need to reinvent the wheel...
BTW I live totally of BTC. Haven't used € now for about 110 days... Using XAPO and Cashila...
EDIT: Hoping to add OneBit to this
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:03:05
No that is not what this is about. It is about changing rules of transactions by creating fee market. Also a lot of users would like to see that changed but are ignored and have no way to fork the chain since it is too risky. You need much more then 50% to make that happen(and you need to organize). So devs are making decisions on there's behaves without listening to users(even call them stupid since they don't understand) or get any kind of vote(there was one unofficial with Google forms made by a user on reddit and it was about 75% for some kind of bigger blocks). And when you see that some of the devs will have financial profit from status quo you start asking yourself for who are they working for or what are there interests. Realy not sure if it is a technical one since I can more or less call BS on all technical reasons I know of the rest are just political ones...
BTW I'm running XT so I'm already doing that... But that will not give me big blocks. I need 75% of hashing to get that. And I don't look to get altcoin. I would like to get Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-07-23 11:42:25
For bitcoin to work yes but you would need to trust it and that will never happen. So some might and use it and some will say I will run my own(even if the don't really blocks) and some will make a good node... So one node will never happen so why talk about it... It is like what would you do if you would get hit by a meteor while being on fire while havering sex... It is just a theoretical example that can happen only in theory...
Number of nodes would be increasing if node would not be needed to have a wallet at the start of Bitcoin.... One user one node... Now that is no longer a case and users that were forced to run it have stopped ruining it... And there are a lot of users who would give a network a favour if they stop running it... Just look how many old nodes are out there... There are 0.8.0 still out there...
EDIT: 8 time more space also means about 8 times more users... So you need less of them to run a node...
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:52:19
Well I have a 10/10 that is the second cheapest option in my country. If I would pay 10€ more I would get 10/100 and additional 5 would get me 100/100. Ping times outside the country on speedtest servers are less then 50ms. So good connection in EU is cheap. And 10MB/s+ upload speed with TV(with premium channels like HBO) and phone line would cost me about 60€... Datacenter including server hosting with 1000/1000 is 120€...
EDIT: Currently I'm paying only 45€. I was talking about 100/100 connection cost. Just in case...
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:58:02
It could be just miners luck.
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:58:44
In that case Apple pay will not work anyway...
XAPO is Visa and OneBit is Mastercard Paypass
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:57:10
Personally I'm all for offchain solutions for some transactions but even they will need bigger blocks. So I really don't see rational reason for 1MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:11:55
Sorry for this but I'm like a child before chrisms. The problem is that I don't know if chrisms is tomorrow or mounts away... Any guestimates?
@_date: 2015-07-21 07:15:40
That was a bug not a SPV issue. They were checking blocks. But when verification failed they didn't reject it. They just didn't include any transactions in block and build on it.
So what they were doing was start building on a new block as soon as posible and start verification it. If it verified they would start including transactions in there block. They were missing rejecting block function...
And your theory is missing a small part. Big miners find more blocks that they get started to work on at once. I think it was calculated that this is like 0.1 or 0.01% advantage. So not really advantage but enough to say "it will centralize a network and destroy a bitcoin" BS from opponents.
EDIT: but this has nothing to do with orphan rate but internet speed if I remember right
EDIT2: jstolfi explanation make more seance and what were doing and why they couldn't reject blocks. They were missing time component... Like if you don't get a block in 20 seconds start working on an old one again...
@_date: 2015-07-28 10:14:45

I have some ideas what to add.
Make an option to scan in cards with QR or bar code for gift and loyalty cards.
Add an option to top your wallet of trezor or other hardware ones EDIT: maybe even paper.
Don't make same stupid 6 conformations for any transaction in your wallet as XAPO have. For 10000$ I see a reason but not for 20$... I think one is enough... So set limits to dynamic from 1 or even 0 to 6...
EDIT: Shapeshift.io integration... Receive and send altcoins...
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:24:14
Just ignoring p2p patch... OK...
And argument it will work if stars aligns works also for 8 MB fork. If none mines big block it will still work...
You can call that whatever you like. It created a hardfork even if it was just a SW update. Since there is no bitcoin specification it is specified by SW. And different implementation made hardfork. If there would be a set of rules I would agree. But there isn't one.
But if you are not OK with luke-jr calling this a hard fork and nullc saying you need to patch 2 things to sync for sure and also other devs saying it will not work without changes then I have no idea how can I change your mind. There was a post about it less then a week ago someone also saying what he needed to do to sync original client. And it was that 2 things...
Now go and read a definition of a hardfork...
EDIT: And I'm not talking about 0.4. There are older ones out there  the oldest on this list is from 2011 and it is 0.3.21... But what about 2009?

@_date: 2015-07-23 12:41:36
Now you are putting words in my mouth. How could be 600 nodes centralized? And what about centralization that small blocks have already made. Tipping with Changetip offchain transaction with Coinbase or XAPO or... less onchain gambling... Is that not a problem too?
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:20:18
First of all anything anyone has written is more or less a guess. We have no idea what would happen until it happens. We can only make a educated guess.
I think fee market exists but you can't see it with that small blocks. If they were bigger you would see it more.
It is Block rewords vs Fees vs Size. Bigger the blocks size bigger the chance of an orphan block. Orphan block means you lost 25BTC. So you need transactions that justify risk of on orphan blocks. There is a natural balance. You will not make 1GB block even if there will be no limit on size and 150BTC of fees since it will get orphan 99.9999...% time. But then again you might add 1MB of transaction for 0.25 BTC of fees... That is why we see that not all blocks are full even with unconfirmed transactions still remaining. Not sure how smart miners algorithms are at the moment but they do have them.
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:43:47
No I didn't. Point me where I say this. I was talking about number of users and number of transactions... If you are loosing users number of transaction drops. And since everyone knows Bitcoin doesn't work you don't get new users.
I agree fees will eventualy droped and you will find a number of transactions that Bitcoin can handle but you will lost a lot of time and momentum...
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:03:08
Sure about next year. As far as I know it is about ready. Some bugs were found so it is not in this version of XT.

@_date: 2015-07-07 18:13:23
OK set limit to 100MB... And if we are talking about 100 or more we are talking in post 2025 I guess. From reword going from 50 to 25 miners are making 5 times more now then they were at 50 BTC per block... So if you don't have a crystal ball you just speculating...
EDIT: As a miner I have change a way I work. I was buying electricity of a grid now I have leased a hydro power plant to run miners in it. Don't worry we will adapted.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:43:01
Well Peter Todd has even bigger conflict of interest. Chief scientist of ViaCoin. So make a Bitcoin settlement system and altcoins can be more P2P if you don't like Lightning network...
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:37:46
They do make blocks and that is BIG part of BTC. Anyway I was talking about users not miners...
@_date: 2015-07-31 06:38:49
Depends on architecture but you would need about 20 to 50 of them to get on a level of BTC network... I don't think that will happen since the number will be much higher in the future.
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:08:02
8MB is not BIP100.
2. Remove static 1MB block size limit.
3. Simultaneously, add a new floating block size limit, set to 1MB.
BIP100 is 1MB limit at the start... So 8MB can't interpreted as BIP100. It could be interpreted as BIP101 but even that is not necessary right... But yes format is from BIP100 but it is not voting for BIP100
Adoption means implementation not support so you are also wrong on this one...
7. Changing the 1MB limit is accomplished in a manner similar to BIP 34, a one­way lock­in
upgrade with a 12,000 block (3 month) threshold by 90% of the blocks
You will need a version number change since that was with BIP 34. It chaned V1 to V2...
So you are wrong 2 times... Artical is saying that there is 10% of BIP100 blocks mined and it will go up to 25%. That is not the case... And I think you are right. They are supporting unexciting code...
@_date: 2015-07-21 10:33:16
And that will limit the blocksize where fees will make it worth risk of on orphan. So we have a fee market... No planing with hard limits just demand and supply...
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:20:59
How do they stop 51% attack?
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:37:33
Not a dev but...
It is not FUD. BIP66 made some changes. Miners did impliment them but not all of them also inforce them. It take time to verefiy a block. If you skip that you can mine more time on a next one. Big pools were doing that to get more BTC. They assumed that everyone else is doing the checking and invalid block will not get to them. Big mistake. Antpool lost 1 block f2pool lost 4. And BTCnuggets that started all this is still mining invalid blocks(not upgreded to BIP66).
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:35:39
All I have to go by is this






















And it doesn't sound like you were doing nice things...
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:29:37
Yes but what is price per coin or market cap? Or network effect? That why it makes no sense to attacked it...
@_date: 2015-08-03 10:47:20
First get verified. If you don't you will have to do that when making first deposit.
But yes if you would like to buy with credit card(see fees) you can get not only BTC but also some altcoins. And if you are ready to wait for a right moment you can get them at normal princess. If not it will cost you about 2 to 4 $ or € per BTC more not including credit card fees.
But to cash out is one of better option if you are in EU and you sold your coins for €. Not so much for $... So go and look at fees they have. You also can't exchange $ to € without going in one of the coins...
@_date: 2015-07-25 10:04:06
This looks like art to me. Is this a normal picture you get with chain of transaction? If not this could be someone making blockchain art.

@_date: 2015-07-22 20:13:26
The problem is that you are not getting it how it works and I really have no time to waist going into details. It works and pools are doing it.
EDIT: reply from there:
No think again. There is no central point. It is just hi speed p2p network inside a p2p network... You also have a big mash of stratum connections... All this is part of a BTC. I think you just don't understand it how it works and you are confused.
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:14:19
Sure about North America? Everyone is saying that geting more then 1MB upload there is mission impossible and any size increase will make running node impossible for everyone... You are after all behind Estonia...
But I think miners in China might get advantage since they don't need quick connection to the rest of the world just to 51% of the mining power...
EDIT: Anyway china has cheaper electricity then practically everyone. So they can afford to loss some advantage.
@_date: 2015-07-21 10:35:41
Lets say you have a fork. And one has mining power the other has a big part of activity. So killing that fork will increase activity in there fork in a long run so killing it is in there best interest...

@_date: 2015-08-19 06:55:06
Short time maybe probably... And how is 75% expose to attack? And I think that in 14 days that you would have time to switch there would be a exodus to XT... And at forking time massive dumps of QT coins...
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:56:36
It is democracy...
And no 12000 blocks is a diffrent number... It is number of blocks BIP is looking at. If 90% of them are BIP100 BIP activate it self...

@_date: 2015-08-18 22:07:28
Not really if you could make money out of keeping blocks small(LN). Or even be chef scientist of altcoin... You do have big reasons to fight against change that would drop your earnings. And use your influence to change things.
One example is that one of big supporters of small blocks convinced F2Pool to start using replace by fee. They might changed that since there was a lot of complains from community but that doesn't change the fact that it was done on advice of someone. So this is a problem for 0 conformations but not for LN... Do I need to name names or we know who I'm talking about...
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:09:49
Thanks for sum up. You might edit this a bit... List of BIPs is confusing...
EDIT: "The network does not actually fork until having 90% miner support"
Really? That is only the case with BIP 100. Not the rest...
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:10:53
Well I got verified in that time but I was doing that in a day time in EU now is night. I was guessing you would do the same since you were in a hurry so I didn't add time frame. Sorry for that. But I have told you that you need to get verified. And they tell you that you need to look at limits and commissions just above Proceed button so I really don't know how could you not know.
EDIT: I see you are chaining a story a bit... So start of your verification did take a bit longer then a hour... You did manage to read 1 hour for verification but not that you need it. So not surprised that you missed this even if it is one click after you see that your limit is 0$...
Verification process instructions:
Below are the obligatory requirements for documents and selfie. Please, make sure that your scans correspond with the following requirements:
Documents should be valid due to the issue date;
Both sides of documents have to be scanned;
Scanned images should be in colour and in high resolution (at least 300 dpi);
Allowed formats: JPG, GIF, PNG, TIFF or PDF;
File size should be no more than 15 MB;
Scans should not be older than 3 months;
Documents should be issued using characters of Latin alphabet or have Latin transliteration of main fields.
So if you would look at verification you would see this.
Also using someone else credit card is a stupid idea. She should register. This scream credit card fraud.
And I really don't believe you that they will not send money back.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:43:36


The way you write it is not clear if they would run a core with a fork to 8MB or only core. I assumed you ware talking about forked core. But then I found that Chinese are no longer supporting there own proposal... So go figure...
@_date: 2015-07-28 09:55:57
I know I will get downvoted but devs are also political leaders who are taking decisions in ours names. And they are not even elected or necessary represent our opinion. So point to me where a dictator is not personally attacked? Maybe not in his face but still.
Decision that have noting to do with science but only personal ideas or guesses how things will and should play out are political decision(even if you mask it as technical one) personal attack is contribution. If you don't like it don't make political decision and change Bitcoin so that we will have failed transactions that worked days before or introducing new components like fee pressure to it...
To date I have not seen a technical argument for 1MB that I can't dismiss with political argument(since it is a political one) or/and point to technical solution...
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:53:07


Yes. And what is a problem with that? If you need a node for some reasen you can still have it. I have run a node on a 384kbit upload limit. I wasn't sending out a lot... And I'm told that that is tipical US upload for home users. So even now you are not a full node on a slow conection. Everyone gets blocks way before you can upload it to them... It is like a torrent that just got uploaded... Have you ever seen that?


I really don't see why. If you are ruining it with a reason it is the main traffic and not an issue. If you are ruining it to help the network you should have a good connection. If you are just ruining it on a bad one you really shouldn't doing it even now since you are not helping... torrent distribution...




Yes they do in 90% of a cases...  And why would we need this nodes when we can get better one with new businesses and users... It is also qualety. And 8MB still shuld not be a problem since numbers have shown that 20 would not be... I think there was a mistake in calculations and it was number for 10 but still.
Anyway who is saying we will have full blocks the next day?

Yes and I told you full node is not needed on tor. Hire I agree with core dev that this is pointless... And please read carefully. I didn't say running a node using tor but other ways... Tor isn't safe or anonymous anyway... This is more or less public by now...


I did and it looks like you are not reading it. You even comment on it as a central solution. 


Yes but everyone has them at 5% with less then 1%(0.1 or 0.01%) difference do to size in case of 20MB... So it is more or less the same... And that would only apply in case of a old way of doing things... So really how is that a problem. You can solve that with adding DVC merge mining...


No think again. There is no central point. It is just hi speed  p2p network inside a p2p network... You also have a big mash of stratum connections... All this is part of a BTC. I think you just don't understand it how it works and you are confused.


"Can you give me ETA for that?" No, but clearly you can: "Lightning will not be ready in time"
Can you give an ETA of transaction-volume being so high people are forced to use centralized solutions?
For lightning network I can't since even the one working on it can't. So it is long way away... For full blocks I can tell you that projections are showing. We have from 5 to about 9 months.
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:24:22
That I can change a code myself. According to you ther is no problem and I can just fork the code and have a Bitcoin if I don't like what devs are doing...
@_date: 2015-07-21 10:24:33
I'm not. All I'm saying is that they will attack chain that is taking money from them wouldn't they... That is why I used 51% attack...
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:59:42
Oh so you are one of Mycelium team. Thanks for grate app... How is Bitcoincard going? Any guesstimates on release date?
EDIT: I have some worries that it might brake in a pocket...
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:21:53
WTF? This has noting to do with what is going on. It was just a bug in implementation and not SPV... But from a style this is written I guess facts have noting to do with purpose of writing this... Now it is clear why we needed BIP66 and others so... I guess this must be a joke I don't get...
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:14:09
No you don't get open source and Bitcoin... You can fork it and if you have 51% you have a Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:40:57
As long as they don't push there agenda and making thing controversial... This way someone who thinks that someone is pushing there agenda can bypass 5 and asks users... Wouldn't you agree that that is more decentralized? If you would like to vote download core or XT. Buy a miner... Slush is mining XT blocks. I was mining on p2pool XT node till Slush start using XT core... Put your money where your mouth is...
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:51:42
Google PayCoin and see what happens...

@_date: 2015-08-19 01:43:18
Yes because over 50% of my ASIC don't play nice with p2pool. If they would make it ASIC friendly I would stay there... I had to fix problems entire day... From cgminer creasing and for some reason not restarting to creased controllers. Also I was getting about 6% smaller hashrate...

US not, EU yes...

This one has or had trecking firmware(mastr cooke) and a bug in a loader. Not sure if it was fixed. And it is incompateble with trezor firmware(buttons works in difrent way) so you can't just change it. So not such a good choice.
@_date: 2015-07-21 10:28:52
None. I just pointed out that if you don't have miners on board you don't have it. So significant holders will loss everything do to 51% attacks on chain miners don't like...
@_date: 2015-08-01 10:20:04
I don't think it will happen but 1CF9QmxPAJPDaVSzz4yzUJyShiKnC3z3Ke
EDIT: But it might help someone who needs to make QR code...
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:54:27
Well it could also be a position of power. Or any other asset that some have.
By your own words you were hi in intelligence so you might even pushing government agenda in your case... Double agents are hard to find and they don't need to do a lot to make a difference... They just need to be smart. You sure are. And seeing what happend to Snowden or Assange... Well... You see why I think you should not be trusted on face value and doubt anything that I can't find a reasonable... It could as well be that you know what NSA can do but it could also be that you are doing something for them that will be clear in 50 steps from hire...
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:22:25
Number of transaction on a BTC network can drop. If I stop using it since fee is to hi number of transaction will drop and if I'm using it all the time number will increase. Now multiply me by a 1000 or 10.000 or more... I do my best not to use € in my life thanks to XAPO and Cashila.
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:18:37
And you got censored...
But I know Antpool and Slush are for 8MB blocks. As far as I know there is about 65% of the mining pools that started casting votes...
EDIT: Hope this helps 
@_date: 2015-08-01 20:50:46
Well it kind of works already I guess. XAPO credit card connected to Apple pay... But I'm not sure if they are still available in US. You have some crazy regulators there... xapo.com
Android will work soon. OneBit... They are in close Alpha and will soon open it to others. Register at getonebit.com
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:10:04
The only time I need it is when I use torrent so I don't have to wait too long... and windows updates when I install a new machine... You might think you need it but you might figure out you don't. But not sure about what you are doing with internet. I know you have Minepeon but I guess this is just a small part of your work...
P.S. I made a small mistake datacenter price doesn't include electricity. And it cost about 30% more then on a market. I guess air-conditioning costs included...
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:29:51
I thought it is just number of grains of sends on earths you get from creating earths from grains of send on earth. It is still astronomical number but that makes the number even bigger...
Thanks for this info.
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:09:53
Well you do know your argument that you didn't signed up for is kind of contrary to what apoefjmqdsfls is saying just below you and arguing that there was no promise...
And but we can also do this. And I didn't sign on to 5 devs but to something that anyone can change with enough support.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:46:27
That is called 51% attack... But this introduces 25% attack...
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:36:15
Well we can say 50k(same as now) for hi priority transactions(can go even if fee is 0 if enough days are destroyed) 1MB for low fee transactions the rest for hi fee transactions. Miners can set the limits... Spam probably solved unless miners are setting limits too low... And you have fee market that you more or less know how it works. Big pools can give a quote on there pages or in Blockchain...
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:15:01


OK node number is not a rational one. It is decisioning because we don't need it to run a wallet. New core client makes need for store full blockchain unnecessary. So no problem with that. Internet connection for someone who is not a miner is also not an issue as long as he can get 8MB in 10 minutes.


The one that needs to will have a way. But do we really need a node in Africa running off a solar panel for a year longer when we will need to increase the limit anyway in exchange for more centralized off-chain solution?


Why not. If you are running a node not to mine you have 10 minutes to download a block. Running a tor node is something you for your own security not for the network.


No it was something complicity different. A bug in a code.


This was a bug. Miners have a solution already. Connect to pools and get block hash. Than start making an empty block till you get block from network. They forgot to add if they don't get a block in some time they switch back to old one...


That is again far from rational. Even if all the world would use lightning network we would still need 133GB blocks(that is from presentation of lightning network), so we will need to increase it anyway. And this gives us time to make lightning network.


What X is for Luke-jr? What X is for Peter Todd?
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:26:04
Than it is time to move to Slush
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:41:16
Well that would be a news to a lot of users hire...
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:00:42
Or get a orders of magnitude more transactions... Oh 20 MB would solve that. And mining network doesn't need to stay same as it is now. If it doesn't pay for mining miners will stop and difficulty will adjust... Just look at LTC. Price went from 50 to 1,5 and mining drooped but coin still worked...
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:34:32
Yes I was listening to that. And he only has a problem with miners propagation time. But that is no longer a way miners are doing things... They have direct connections to each other and mining accounts on ather pools to get block hash as fast as miners on that pool... So problem is already solved... But he will find new X...
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:35:52
Don't see MIT as a problem but please let me know how it is. But competing altcoin... How that not a problem?
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:48:22
There will bee a fork of core that will only had a 8MB patch and XT will also be 8MB. Just reading all before commentating would help you know that...
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:05:04
Block version number. But they didn't go over transactions. Just assumed that block was valid and start mining the next one.
Edit: I guess they were enforsing it just in there own blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:45:02
There is no IP blacklist that is just FUD...
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:13:08
You buy direct. In that way it is p2p...
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:21:22
So not really 42 millions
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:28:30
It will probably happen without attack. But would you say no to Bank if you would have to replace all dollar bills with one with different picture(you don't like) on it to use them? When money is in a play it isn't that hard...
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:57:32
I agree. We need something better than QR codes. I think we need processors and wallets to integrate in easy way. Like entering some numbers and the rest is done by processor and wallet.
Let say you need to enter 182934 where first numbers are for processor and last invoice... For security reasons there would still have to be some address seen and some indication that you connected to processors but that can be solved with certificates. Than all you need to do is press send... You would need to update list of processors but you end up with something you can type.
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:35:02


Didn't know that... Thanks!!!
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:39:14
Not sure about collapse but I guess you are just being dramatical right? Bitcoin would still work just in a different way and it might have some problems on the way there. Unless that problems kill the momentum then it will be just another altcoin to whoknowswhat. Maybe even Citicoin...
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:31:43
Don't see a problem with that. It will not happen. Chain with less power will die soon or get 51% attacked to death... And I guess dumps to... And the way fork rules are done it will be small block not big block as you are implying... So dumping BTX will be a big problem for dumpers... As far as I know big Chinese pools and exchanges are behind big blocks.
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:08:23


We all know SegWit is about 1,5 to 1,8x and they are talking to decrease discount for SegWit data. So it is 3MB best case...
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:10:03
It had 7 dips in node count last year so no... It is just not publicised... And it might been one this year. Hard to say. It might be just fake nodes shutting down...
I lost about ~~1,7~~ 1,6 BTC do to core bug... About 1000€ at that time... EDIT: 8.4.2014... Hours before a warning was on bitcointalk...
@_date: 2017-04-19 06:59:28
That is like only one unlikely scenario. I think UASF would be seen by miners as attack on them and they would attack UASF... I know I would just to show a point... And if you would fork to GPU I would attack that too... I moved a lot of mining of ASIC back to GPUs since that makes more money...
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:55:36
For this you need to know how miners are working now a days. They don't use just nodes to get hash for last block. They are also getting it from competition directly same way as miners on a pool. But since they didn't get block over a network they have no idea what transactions were included in the last block. To avoid rejected block they start mining empty block. When block comes over the network they verify it and start adding transactions in block they are building. Since getting blockhash is taking less then a second and getting block and verifying it takes much longer there is a good chance to see empty block.

Roadmap... Nothing in it solves bandwidth problem any batter than alternative...
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:16:33
Why would you pay 0.17$. That is the last fee I pay to buy more ETH with Shapeshift... If I do it with LTC it cost me less then 0.01$... If you would like to just hodl OK. But I used to live off it. Stopped and changed back to €... It was getting more expensive then using a bank. I lost 1% per exchange and then fees were getting to account for about 5€... Bank account in my country cost about 1€ or 5€ if you are stupid... You have web-banking credit and debit card and 0.3€ per SEPA transaction... It worked for some time. I was using Trezor and move what I need over the day to XAPO and pay bills with Cashila that was also converting my paycheck to BTC. But if you don't know if money moved from Trezor will be on your XAPO account hours later and you can't buy things because of that and in addition you pay about 5 to 7 times more you give up... I'm waiting for alternative crypto I can live off...
EDIT: and local discount coupons for food and other staff could also be bought with BTC.

O really? Than I'm sorry to say you are a liar. I have admitted that I have taken things out of context. You can't even admit that one of brothers has noting to do with Classic and what he did is totally legal where he lives... Than I'm guessing you are talking about Mike who has noting to do with Classic, that why I'm guessing... Do I need to go on?
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:22:46
Yes sorry got that around... Fusion is deuterium tritium and fission is plutonium or uran...
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:52:46
And it is only anti TOR attack tool. My node was attacked and I had to block about 100 IPs on FW. This way you don't need to black the TOR on FW. It is batter for TOR since whan attack is over you are again serving it.
@_date: 2015-07-28 10:07:51
And result will be Bitcoin XT and not BTC so not really..
EDIT: To make another point. China is for 8MB blocks but only in a core... Not XT or fork of a core...
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:33:23
I dont undersend why Bitreserve dont have one... I would used there gold option way more.
@_date: 2016-02-03 00:08:10
OK so still no decentralized routing...
@_date: 2016-02-03 08:08:23
From reading abstract none of them makes routing. It is just a way to increase speed or decrease traffic... But they are both using existing routes or using other routing methods that end up on IP, DNS,... level. So it needs some centralized architecture that helps. I didn't read the full thing so you can tell me the part I need to read if I'm wrong...
@_date: 2017-04-11 10:06:12
You do know there is a limit how fast difficulty can adjust down right? It will be much longer then that...
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:48:05
Even if I were sure BU would win I would not buy on Bitfinex(or any other exchange) any token with expiration date build in. And if I remember right "Loaded" just suggested but not agreed... When Roger agree he was gone...

Now I know more about it so I know there is no need to open it to internet. At that time I didn't... I fowerd port 8333 and 8332 to computer too...


I did...


Then give me a reasonable explanation... No viruses with found online and offline scans. No traffic that can't be explained and in last 3 years no problems with LTC wallet...
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:18:59
Like bailin? Suspicious actively report? Civil forfeiture? Identity theft? Paying for privilege for them to gambling with your money? Money londering for Mafia? Bank works to the moment it don't and if you would read how insurance works... Well it works as long as we are talking in small numbers of not to big banks going under... Just ask Greece or Cyprus people.
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:18:28
If I answer you I will get banned from hire. There are places you can ask this kind of questions to get full answer. This is not one of them.
Anyway. You will have to retransmit your transaction. Network rejected it...
@_date: 2017-04-27 08:57:51
It was... Not sure why it is big deal now... Wait! Yes I know...
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:43:12
That only works if you have more then 33% of power... EDIT: And even if your chain temporally "dies" you can make it alive again... Also you can just fake signalling and then take anyone can spend transactions... Who knows what miners will do...
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:42:53


EDIT: Just to clerafay.
1. No SegWit is not 2x and can't even in theory be 4x... Picture is also misleading. For SegWit you need 2 houses... And together they are just a bit bigger then same size 1 house would be.
2. Libsecp - OK no problem...
3. Bips, No problem. But selling LN Big problem... For now routing is centralized(yes even or anyone else can tell us of an other way) or with big hubs that LN will end up making anyway(same way as mining is making big pools)... EDIT2: 
4. Thin Blocks that were beta in XT were killed by changes in core 0.12. IBLT is still theoretical... Weak blocks to. But they look more simple to solve...
5. They might think that(I do my best to assume good faith) but I don't think this will be endgame with this roadmap. I would say we would end up with 5 to 20$ fees on a blockchain and 3 big LN hubs that will process 75 to 90% of the traffic. Why. Cost of blockchain transactions will increase centralization. And since we don't have decentralized routing for LN even in theory... Well routing would work best with small number of hubs. That why you use highway to travel(faster) and that why everyone will use big hubs. They might have some other channel open if they justified fees but I don't see that happening offen...
@_date: 2016-02-03 00:15:24


What you told me to be a solution unless it is very clever alternative to what I think you are talking about can't scale...
@_date: 2016-02-25 09:55:32
So I guess we can say that it was not clear who represents who in this meting. So this might not be the only misconception.
@_date: 2017-04-04 09:55:02


Like that will ever happen after all that 1MB is key to Bitcoin coming from core right now... If not forced there will always be some fundamentalists that will mine 1MB chain. The only way I see it done is with soft 1MB to no transaction, hard fork to bigger blocks and merge mining of big block chain of 1MB chain...
Edit: and can you tell me why some of thouse arguments don't applay to SegWit?
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:36:24
But will it fail or not? We might not know that for days, weeks or months
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:43:24
Well accepting bitcoins for her services would work to... I'm sure some costomers would love this option. And I would guess it is safer for all involved.

Money in a bank is not yours... You have a IOU from a bank and if you are really nice they will let you do things they think you can with their money. They might even give it back to you...

If you say so... I didn't see any difference from the past and even if you say it is just SPAM this SPAM is paying fees that are really hi so I don't think it is a SPAM... It might be tumblers...
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:06:15
And I don't agree with this. It will since less users means less transactions...
@_date: 2016-02-03 07:19:25
That is same as if I were ask you about bitcoin and you were link me to private key incription and hash functions. Something wery importent is missing...
@_date: 2016-02-04 16:09:26
That is my point. I did what you did. Didn't make it up but put it out of context.
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:32:39
See my edit that was added before your question...
@_date: 2016-02-04 15:22:31
Well I can do some scamer claims and even NSA money takers claims for core devs. And make same clam for classic as you did for core. But what is the point? But we do know that smear campaign was promised. And we know you...

@_date: 2016-02-03 00:03:08


That why it was not implemented in anything production at the moment. And now it can't even be implemented when testing would be done. And after reading what you wrote none of this was an issue since it was not implemented the way you are saying it was.


Link would be nice... But I don't think that would scale... It would get too loud relay fast...

Do what I did. Run Bitcoin XT and not a core.
@_date: 2017-04-21 08:39:29
Luke presented a code in 2017. As I told you I can make HF code in 5 minutes. If there was something there it was not ready for core demanded standards... I will read all but keyword search just didn't find anything I would say ready HF... But you can point out what I missed and save me hours of reading...
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:42:11
BUT THEY HAVE ALSO VERIFICATION. And they are also fast... They contacted me in about 2 hours if I remember right. Also credit cards. But there are limits on how much you can get as new customer and price isn't that grate...
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:44:23
Well you are missing one important point. Orphan blocks. Bigger the block higher the danger of it. So it is not as simple. Fees must justify danger of an orphan block. So you do get a point where you will need to balance block rewords and fees.
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:20:51
To make sure everyone gets the masage it is not safe and end fork and 1MB religion... Why did LTC miners attacked FTC? It also make no sense...

WTF?!?! If I was the fire-fighter behind a wheel there would be one more person on a way to emergency room.
Why? I could not listen to a word you told so this was pointless... You should just move. I had to close my eyes and listen.
@_date: 2016-02-03 00:26:50
OK so from what I understand what you are talking about is a general way routing on internet works. That only works because you have IP addresses. So lightning would need something like that... How would you do that is beyond my imagination since "IP addresses for lightning" would need to follow some format biased on connections and be related to payment addresses... That why I'm saying that will not scale... If routers would need to know where to send data for every address not just subnets they would need a lot of storage...
EDIT: That why you can't use MAC addresses outside subnet... MAC addresses are also unrelated to destination as are bitcoin addresses...
EDIT2: Adding "LN IP" as additional layer would also need central authority or they would be random and useless...
EDIT3: OK I will assume that you were bluffing that you know for a solution that would work... The best solution that I can think of would be ping all channels and asking nodes to do the same with TTL increasing until you find a way... If both nodes do that you decrease traffic by much but that is about as scalable as blocksize increase(Yes I do know it is not a solution but is the best one at the moment) and is just asking for big hubs...
@_date: 2017-04-16 01:05:37
I'm just pointing out why I would not buy them and that why they can't represent market... Just the gamblers...
And no. It was not gambling to me. I use them everyday instead of fiat. But at current fees and conformation times I stooped... That broke about 2 years living and getting paid in bitcoin... Since EU banking system is much batter then US it would cost me about 5 to 10% of my salary to use BTC(exchange to BTC, fees, XAPO, Cashila, Bitpay fees) to about 1% when using bank... Days I used Bitcoin again and it cost me more then 6€ to move about 600€ and I still had to use ViaBTC transaction accelerator to get conformation when I figure out that 24 hours later is still unconfirmed... And wallet(mycelium) assessment was 3 hours. Bank would do that for 0.3€ and less then 1 day in EU.
@_date: 2017-04-12 08:21:40


You are assuring miners will not strike back and mine empty blocks. They might... Are they still BIP148 blocks if there is a PoW change. What if there is another attack and so on... Miners in China do have GPUs... It is only for gamblers and only Casino is sure to make money... And BIP148 can kill bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-04-20 09:11:50
Well as long as you don't reorg new one enough time to make new one useless... Then you start mining the other... You can even mine new one just to reorg it and then start mining old one again when you kill it...
EDIT:

Nope. You are changing what was in agreement.


That is only one interpretation of what wos in it but all deadlines were missed in any case...


Nope. They agreed to run core but F2Pool just modify the core to signal but didn't change consensus rules after you started to change what was in the agreement to send a signal to you.


Well it looks like everyone was under the impression that you did that. Just look at the news at that time and miners got that impression as well. And you did nothing to change that for some time...
So don't play stupid now...
EDIT: In addition someone was pushing consensuses to make money with long position he bought. We learn that from F2Pool operator...

Not really. At lest not for long time. One will die and it will probably take hours to days...
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:14:16


Nope if you are slow there is no need to relay... Everyone will get blocks from someone who is not... Like it is happening now...


This has noting to do with what I wrote... Read again... What I was saying is that you no longer need a core to run a wallet and even 1MB blocks will not change that. The one that runs core to run core will also have no problems since it is no longer necessary to store full chain.


Well do we need ones with caps to run them. First they have slow upload so they more or less just make loads on better nodes that we need... And to have them we need to use centralized solutions since there is no ETA for decentralize ones. I say no... But if it brings benefits to user he/she/it will find a way... Also I'm relay sorry if you live in US but that is what happens whan you have a dingo as a had of SEC.


Again you don't need to relay. All you need is a block in 10 minutes... You are not running it to relay blocks. If that is your goal you can do in differently.


Yes it was. And If you don't understand it I can't make it more simple since it is not. Read again what I wrote.


It was.


Find out how pools are doing it and come back to this. That is the old way of doing things... But even with this old way it is less then 1%... I think it is 0.1% or 0.01%... Something extremely small.
I will attempt again. But if you don't get it I will stop. Pools have "mining" connections to other pools so when pool finds a block they get old block hash as fast as miner on that pool. But they still have to wait to get a block the normal way. So not to get rejected block miners start making empty block from the hash and wait to get the block over the network. When they get it they verification it and start building transactions in a block. The BIP66 problem was that block never came and that why they mined 6 empty blocks. Bug was that they waited for a block without time limit. Like if you don't get a block in 1 minute return to old one...
So in this process block size is not a factor...
EDIT: That is why you can see empty block if one is find right after another...


Can you give me ETA for that? Sorry we will need some centralized solution before that if we don't use bigger block size... Lightning will not be ready in time... So we all just move to Coinbase(you can replace it with any other company that has offchain transactions) and use it as centralized offchain solution till we get Lightning?

Yes but that is like doing internet with MAC addresses. You can't do that since they don't follow specific rule. But with IP addresses you get structure but you need central authorety that issues them or you het same thing as with MAC addresses.

It was not acid. It was pot and that is legal.
Yes he did setup consider.it. So yes he did that but the way you say it sounds complicity different. Add a interface to a web page.
~~And he is not on a side under developers. I can't even find him anywhere else.~~ Missread. So can you provide me with a prof that he was under developers or the only relevant thing that he is a part of a team. Next why him doing something that everyone did is a problem. Using legal substance... I put in this basket also coffee, then is pot then cigarettes and at the end alcohol.
So stop your lies. If I were using your standards I can say that core is private company owned, made and paid by government agents, Viacoin investees scamming and VPN backdooring project... And I could find some additional things if I would really took some time to look into it but again what is the point. It has some bases in reality but totally unfair and out of context as it is your claim.
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:02:04
It looks like it was not core who made that roadmap...
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:39:25
No. I agree that first step is lower fee but you are missing the part that pools don't include all lower fee transaction in a block... Look at memory pool. I'm sure it is not linear with fee. Probably something exponential...
@_date: 2015-07-28 16:01:04
So do you see my point?
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:57:54
More users more new good connected nodes. Bigger blocks more users. So what I'm saying is we don't need nodes that will have problems since they already have problems... I think reason to run a node should be a need to have it. And if you are doing it for the network do it with good connection or not at all. Also I really don't get we need more nodes. We need good nodes not more nodes... And good nodes will came with with new users with good connection not limited low upload ones....
So what would you like to know about distributed databases(ripple)? I know it is not accurate but that is what I think about it. Central control "blockchain" that could be done with database...

What is confused about it? I don't get it... Please address everything you find confused... There are a lot of things that I would do if my mining power would be big enough...
And what I'm saying you can do 41% attack and let old one die... do a big reorg with empty blocks of a new one and go and mine old one for some time. Than again do a reorg of new one and so on... invalidateblock would work just fine for that...
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:21:38
Well if that was a case I would lost LTC and BTC on other addresses in same core... Eligius had some problems and there were big payments at that time. So I don't think so... Unless you are saying R values...
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:54:18
How this works? What if a non-segwit miners mines anyone can spend transaction? That would be a invalid block from my understanding...
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:30:53
So please tell me how roadmap solves that? By adding centralized LN? Routing is for now unexciting or centralized. Your pick...
@_date: 2016-02-07 20:53:04
Well other way around would not change that in any way. This is just a myth that 1MB is somehow immune to that. Even SegWit would do that. And I don't see anyone fighting it... Anyone who need to run a node will still run it. Anyone who doesn't will not... This is what is happening and will go on. Mining centralization will not change unless cost of electricity increases in China and ASIC producers stop selling them at premium to home users...
EDIT: And p2pool get somehow optimized...
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:04:42
I would guess they upgraded to 0.12 and didn't changed default soft limit. Same as BTCC... Core refuse to change it to 1MB... There are even arguments that 750 it too big...
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:39:20
Yes. They took one of my down and I turn 2 more up... :) Will they go for another double or nothing?
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:27:03
That is not finding route just sending data... OK I did skip over parts so I might missed something but I don't think so. But if there is a route finding part in there please show it. But I still think this is just a privacy layer and not finding paths...
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:12:23
They will do SegWit soon... So best case we get 1.8MB if it gets implemented to everything... But it will not be enough to get us to July 2017...
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:01:54
Depends what you call a block.
If you call a block what we have today it lives it the same at best(no SegWit transactions) or reduce it.
If you call a block what we have today and SegWit data than it is a same size at worst(no SegWit transactions) or bigger. Max theoretical size just below 4MB but in reality it will be in 1.6 to 2.3MB if everyone is using it...
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:38:30
Well there was... I remember reading it on Bitcointalk... And it was not just LTC but BTC that were not stollen from that wallet. Only one address was compromised... There were also BTC on other addresses but were not moved... Again I see only two explanations. R value or hearbleed.
Win 7 Pro x64, no password, (sketchy bitcoin: links) not sure what you are talking about, and yes my intention was to help bitcoin network as much as I can...

@_date: 2017-04-25 07:24:58
What would you call a proof? I didn't make any screanshots of tests I did. I'm still using same computer without reinstalling it(I was that confident I was right) without an accident since... Only thing chained was upgrading to 0.9.1 and so on... But I did stop using core at that time. So only LTC wallet has some money in it. Currently about 400$... So if there was anything else then that I would know by now... Only alternative I can think of is reusing R values. But it was about 20 days since I send something out...
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:23:51
Sorry I don't have tweeter so I was guessing but as a reason goes I don't believe it now that you told me... I don't see how that would change blocksize. I would say they have problem admitting they didn't look at settings...
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:50:18
What? I see dates in it. And I see parts with todo... How is my statment FUD?
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:33:36
First I thought it was my computer. But after hours of looking and sniffing traffic and only one key bean emptied I think it was that. It was mining that came to core from Eligius... After that I start using different pool so I could send direct to exchange and then I got Trezor that works great...
EDIT: 
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:28:00
So please give me some dates then. SW was not ready in 60 days. But if you say it was then HF was not ready 90 days later... Luke-Jr put that out this year... I can make HF code in hours but I would not say that is something ready for production...
EDIT: If HF was ready we would know that it was since we were told by someone... What you are saying is totaly new to me
@_date: 2017-04-22 06:21:41

No SegWit blocks are even bigger than normal block. They are 2 not 1 per block you do know that right?
EDIT: "quadratic scaling function" That sound fancy... What part is quadratic scaling function in increasing the blocksize. Please do tell.
@_date: 2017-04-14 18:59:45
You are wrong for a large part of BU crowd... Seeing that core is ready to compromise would help a lot...
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:46:15
SegWit increases blocksize. Well it adds another block you need to download with original block. So how that doesn't increases bandwidth problem? It adds even more data so total of 2 blocks is even a bit more then 1 normal block would be.
EDIT: I don't think you know what SegWit is...

@_date: 2015-09-14 12:50:54
I don't care how specification is worded... I didn't say it needs to be in English. But it needs to be hardware and software independent... And as you say you need to be on a right side if it is not. But that is just luck not running a core since it could be something connected to hardware or OS or even some compiler or... I think you see my point since you kind of made it yourself too. Even running a core is not 100% safe. It might be a bit more then something other or it might not be...
@_date: 2015-09-14 12:04:34

No. It is limit added and it is as artificial as 1MB limit. It is to save RAM(in old WinNT computers). It was 32MB but with 1MB limit was drooped to 2MB. It can be anything you code it to be. You just change a number... It is not a problem... And it was already done once...

@_date: 2015-09-03 21:40:00
Yes but if you don't take it from 2009 but for this year you get different sets of data... My point is if you can make 8GB block that doesn't mean you will make it. Or we would have 32MB blocks and then 1MB blocks... We didn't and that is a point. This will just get as in IPv4 situation.

@_date: 2015-09-02 21:04:18
Removing 32MB limit so we don't risk IPv4 situation would also be a good thing... It is no longer historical since to was already changed once. And if there is a WinNT computer out there I will pay for upgrade... And making lower limit dynamic based on average size x 1,2 to 1,5 would also a good idea. If you are ready to give miners so much power you need controls in place...

My guess is if you look at hash distribution per server is that they are using all servers to balance users around so attacked needs to attack all servers.

No it came out like weeks ago not last year that it is blocking TOR and that next step is blocking Snowden and Wikileaks... And there is no blocking. Only if you get attacked you drooped connections over 120 coming from TOR...
BTW look at core code. If node is misbehaving it blacklist it...
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:21:02
Yes it was pull out of retirement since source of attack is TOR. As this was introduce final solution would be to deprioritized attacking IPs and not downloading a list... And even TOR deprioritized has noting to do with transactions... WTF are you talking about...
@_date: 2015-09-14 13:01:03
Well if you need that level of security you should run multiple cores on different OS and different versions... I think it is about the same chance that XT core will accept invalid transaction as 32bit core running win8.1 but 64bit core on Linux Ubuntu 14 will not...
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:53:46
I did read and listen to presentations. And I don't see it happening as some are saying it will. Everyone running hubs... I see 3 to 5 big hubs controlling 50 to 70%. Why? To run a useful hub you need to have a lot of BTC... And if someone scam you you will need to dump that to overloaded blockchain and pay a hi fee. Small blocks can even become attack vector on LN. Blocks need to be big enough to dump all traffic on LN to BC if there is an attack by one big hub... If not it can run away with a lot of BTC... If I get time I might write something about that...
But that is not the point I was making... There are different criteria when it comes to things some peoples agrees with or not... And I don't like it... Especially since they are acting like that is not the case...
@_date: 2015-09-03 07:06:40
No. 32MB limit is to hi. If it was 8MB or maybe 16MB then yes. By the time we get to 32MB limit another hard fork debate will kill me... We can start having it right now so we will finish by the time it will be 50 years too late...
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:28:30
My core was dosed 1 time in 1 year. XT 1 or 2 times a week... And when we got a fix for that it was called blckslisting, blocking... sky was falling... XT will kill BTC... Even after explaining that this is just a start of much batter fix that will not use lists...

No there is a bigger chance that something goes wrong if you run QT for 32bit for Windows then XT 64bit for Linux.

@_date: 2015-09-20 16:35:37
From what I seen it is a great application to centralize bitcoin on hubs. I know that for some reason devs hope that everyone will run a hub but to run a hub you need a lot of BTC committed... So only big players will run it... It is even in presentation that you need persons with a lot of money for this to work... Also if a blockschain transaction is to expansive you will not committed a transaction to blockchain if just small amounts were taken from you.
It works in theory but I don't think it will work as expected in practice...

That would not be a problem if we would not have a protocol by implementation... EDIT: and it dosen't make one node more right the another. You just need to be lucky enough to be on right side of a split...
And even different version of the core have this problem... Like 32/64 bit different OS that we now know about and BIP66 fixed(if I remember right). So not really a argument for running a core since I need to run the right one on right OS... It would work if we should all run same OS with same hardware and software...

I can tell you that it was and it wasn't. Peter did find an error(he should double one of the numbers) but proposal was not changed because of that since Gavin didn't see it as a big problem. It was China...
I can't give you a quote since it was ether on youtube or soundcloud and I can't remember where or what show... I just remember I didn't read it... And I think there was also Peter who brought that up. But I might be mixing 2 interviews... It is so long back...

Add something that removes 32MB limit. Like if blocksize is 32MB 3 changes in a raw and 90% miners vote for that it is moved to 64MB and then to 128MB... IPv4 can happen at 32MB. If we had a 8MB or maybe 16MB it would probably not happen but at 32MB enough time will past that it might happen. How long is a change to IPv6 and still far from finished...
@_date: 2015-11-26 19:51:23
Just to be clear. I know what we are talking about in general but everyone definition of this is different and for some reason requirements of the level changes too. This is something I would like mathematically or programmable defined if you plan to use it against XT or BIP101. So it can be used against I don't know let say BIP65 being soft fork... That was a point of the question. With this link you are saying we/I will tell you what that is since we/I know best...






I know I'm putting this a bit out of context ~~a bi~~t but still this is what can be done. You decide it is Sybil attack and 5% is enough but in other cases 95% is not enough since you decide it is Vote stuffing... By you I don't necessary mean you but someone from core or someone making a decision do we have consensus... And yes we do have a Sybil attack on reddit(and other places) to help core...
That is why I would like to see clear rules that are then followed and not changed when needed.

No. You have no clue what is happening. There is a program masking as a XT 10.2 node and it is running on TOR. It asks for old blocks that are all close to 1MB and it is using multiple TOR exit nodes... It dose 2 things. Overload your HDD and make as many as posible connections to you. So it overloads you ability to connect to other nodes. You no longer sync... There are variance of this attack. It could be just one of those 2 things... This is a attack deprioritizing is protecting against...

How do you know fee needed in future? What if blocks are full? Nodes will not relay do to too small fee? What if there is an attack by a big hub and tons of transactions need to be broadcast on 1MB blocks? You need blockchain that can handle that.
Fee market? Yes but not the one we were told we will see. We seen this in this spike. See number of LTC transactions... It is BTC fee vs altcoin fee.
EDIT: What about microtransactions that are lower then a fee... Will you transmit that on a network? What if a person who you have channel open to didn't scam you and your channel is more important to you then the loss...

When blocks were full in last price spike yes... I remember looking in MyCelium wallet seeing minimal fee 0,5$ thinking I will not change that to normal fee since it has to be an error... It wasn't... That time it was not spam attack but users competing for space...
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:36:42
Still not sure. You might have take that out of context with


So I'm talking about bitcoin as a payment network. Any type is instant or not...
Yes LN will work yes(in some distant future when it will be done). That is my point... It is nominated in bitcoins. Core devs are taking steps to force us use LN or merchant will have to nominate value in BTC not $... Not sure what will happen first. LN or BTC be stable enough to do that...
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:31:06
Since you can't read I see no reason to answer you...(hint: Mempool) But yes RBF is additional step in destroying something that worked good enough. It just needs to be as good as credit cards and it was batter... So it worked good enough but core devs are adding posible attacks on it. My guess is to destroy competition and push LN...
EDIT: But RBF is Op-in so not as big of a problem if you know what that is...
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:16:49
Or crashed at 2MB... I can see this code only do this... And not anything close to make sure this won't happen because a way fork was made... Miners can still mine small blacks if they don't agree... So how this forces miners to do anything? Users can force them not to inflate beyond 21m but they can't force them to implement something that is softforkeble to old rules...
@_date: 2015-11-19 22:59:04
Well I do have LTC so do I need to go to buttcoin now? The only thing I'm sorry is that I didn't get more. But profit isn't everything...
EDIT: You edited more then you wrote you edit. Anyway. Flexcaps(had to google it) do not necerserly resolve those problems. Or CPFP that you added. CPFP add cost and could add attack vector if blocks are full and you wait too long so attacker can broadcast timelock transaction too and put really hi fee on it. For him all is the profit. Flexcaps would penalized miners that would like to help and that would drive up fees to levels that dumping transactions to blockschain would not make sense since you would loss more money then was stolen from you on LN...

Go google it. It was represented at one of the conventions. It was done using testnet...
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:37:39
Short answer no.
But if you use Bitcoins without fiat is not too big of a problem if you know what are you doing... Fiat is a hard part... Using ATMs and LocalBitcoins and than tumblers or shapeshift would probably be closest to what you would like to do... But you need to know. Bitcoin is not anonymous. That why you need long enough chains of transactions from any address that can be identified to have plausible deniability. If you do something illegal you can get caught if you make a mistake and someone is motivated to connect the dots... So use TOR, be careful about change addressee used, how hard is it to trek coins before you got them and how hard it is to track after you send them... But you need to know. You are just making things harder not impossible... There is always theoretical possibility it will get tracked...
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:56:16
NO. You are not getting it. You will do that only if it is profitable in long therm. That was my point. Destroying 25% chain is profitable long therm. Anything else is not. Would you for 828.000$ in BTC or $ destroy BTC if you have 2.000.000.000$ in $ invested in it? NO. So cost of that is close to 0.5 market cap of BTC... To get that much out of attack you need much more then what you are saying...
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:25:18
I think this is a catastrophic idea by core devs... This makes bitcoin as a payment network more and more useless... And it is an attack vector... Let assume next scenario. You have service like Cashila. They work on 3 conformations but on exchange rate at 0 conformation. You create a big SEPA(Cashila is BTC to SEPA gateway) transaction and pay with low fee. See where a price moves. If it goes up you flood network with higher fee transactions so nodes forget yours and then double spend it. If price go down let your transaction confirm...
XT implemented this better. It takes 2 transactions at random and drops lower of the two. That way you can't predict when your transaction will be forgotten(it probably never will be since chance of all nodes drooping it is really small) by the network and double spend is detected... This uses collective RAM of all nodes to store different data not the same data...
Core is really killing bitcoin as a payment network...
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:57:37
@_date: 2015-11-27 07:39:11
Yes but why make things worst then they are? Pushing some network? Could it have something to do with storm?
@_date: 2015-11-10 11:55:36
First of all. Who is talking about double spends? What about a group of miners mining offchain and than reconect to chain and take away all BTC from honest miners for smallblocks. Dump coins. Do it again... Miners will stop mining... Let assume same margin of 5% it would not take a lot...
And you do need to know that there is only statistical probability when block will be found. So there is a big possibility that you would not notice if 33% of hashing would go away for 5 hours once a week or so... And that would probably be more then enough to kill miners profits...
@_date: 2015-11-23 10:16:47
OK but closing the channel is expansive and with relative timelock also opening new one in a small block world. It also takes time... Do you have it? That why I'm saying small blocks are attack vector...
EDIT: And I think this LN also decreases velocity of BTC... You can do a lot do transactions in one block with 0 conf but with LN you need to wait for locktime to use same BTC again...
@_date: 2015-11-26 20:02:52
Stop saying BIP103 is ready. It crashes when we get to 2MB. P2P massage was not changed to something bigger then 2MB. And who knows what bugs are there I did not find in 10 minus... And no this time don't tell me I have old data. It is in current code... net.h line 51...

@_date: 2015-11-05 17:26:42
Yes but we do know where big miners are right... Did you took that into account. And small miner can compensate with small blocks... But talking about that is stupid since mining works differently and it is size independent... Bigger blocks would just made more 1 transaction blocks... If you are who I think you should be you are really unaware of a code and how bitcoin really works now a days... Or is this just an act?
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:09:19
No. It looks like lost in translation. We call sudocode also code that is not implemented in any workable way. It can run but as it is is unusable... I might use just the wrong word... Code that can be completely correct but not implemented and used just as a discretion... And this is just code that describe how things work but you can use it as it... You need to add it in a program and it might even have to be changed...
But BIP103 is the stupidest of all so I don't even plan to test it. It is just a distraction to stop baby crying... But if you are not a baby you know what it is...
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:58:05


Only if the block is 1MB transaction and only then. So... BIP101 limits this... For now to 1MB but it might end up 100KB... And there are optimizations in pipeline...


Yes but only if you have same number of transactions that are 8 times bigger... If transactions are same size it is linear...
After that I stop reading since you are full of it...
@_date: 2015-11-22 20:39:54
Small blocks that can be used as an attack. If blocks are to small you can't dump transactions on network. You don't know what fee to set at the time you setup payment chanal. Fee might be higer then what someone scam you for. And who knows what heppens if big hub is hacked and stop playing by the rules. You need a lot of BTC to run hub so there will be big ones...

How? You would need to be connected to a mining node. But none of the miner who is not stupid will let you connect to him. And what are the chances for you to be connected only to 1 node and it is a miner that just fund a block in seconds it takes to verify it... And 0 conf are low value...

@_date: 2015-11-27 07:15:23
Not if you can't setup exchange rate. This is my point. You need to set exchange rate at 0 conf. And if 0 conf gets destroyed by the changes they are making well that is a attack vector on payment mechanism. You might use 6 conf but you need to set exchange rate at 0 conf... And if that is attacked based on changes of exchange rate then you have a problem...

Yes but assuming that price splits 25% 75%(just to make things smiple) this attack still pays it self with about 1,25 times more then just mining... And you get 33% more coins on BIP101 side. And when core fails and bip101 get all the value you gain 25% on you BIP101 coins... As I told you there are incentives to do it... With that you eliminate 25% of hashing power and 25% that are paid by eliminating it...
Anyway even where there is mining arbitrage and all there are incentives in same form so yes expensive but profitable... Up to 1,7 times more profitable long term then just mining...

OK you don't get it and you never will I guess... You don't need perfect...
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:14:50
Opt-in is OK what was not OK was that next thing was push by Peter Todd to make that default. To make it more like Full RBF. Stop destroying 0 conf.
EDIT: And don't give me BS that 0-conf doesn't work. It works good enough...
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:23:03
Yes but that brakes bitcoin as payment system...
@_date: 2015-11-20 21:46:41
Don't forget exchange. And you get secondary supply of "bitcoins". You can run fractional reserve system... All you need is settlement that average to minus something since you are mining...
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:02:41
Unlimited then... I'm all for it. Unfortunately here is a overflow... So computers don't like unlimited... Every number that computer can work with has upper limits... When you pass it it jumps to max negative value or 0 or even worst. It crashes a program...
@_date: 2015-11-27 12:24:25
No I'm talking about not making 0 conf unsafe to the level that you can't even use them to set exchange rate. It will not be a problem as long as there are hi enough numbers of XT nodes out there. But this is just a example how core is making 0 conf even more borken.
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:36:41
Well miners are doing it so... BIP66 accident probably add some time-outs... And there is a fast relay network... And I don't see how we just destroyed SPV assumptions... Empty block will not make other nodes accept invalid block... And mining nodes will not accept SPV connections... Unless they are stupid... So please explain...
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:21:19
At the moment there is only one alternative to blockchain. Coinbase wallet and Coinbase as processor... So you are all for centralization. We need system to work now not in distant future...
0 conf is more secure then credit cards at the moment. But that is getting fixed with things like this mempool. It will soon less secure... or stop working altogether...
But I'm not talking about delivering on 0 conf at all. I think you are not getting it. If you destroy 0 conf to the point that is completely insecure you can't use it even to setup exchange rate. And bitcoin as payment network is dead... Then you MUST use LN and bitcoin is only settlement layer...
@_date: 2015-11-10 11:19:19
And short lived since it is not safe. Bigblock side can put 25%+ of that 75% power it has to kill it of without any risk to security... And it has economic incentives to do so...
Anyway it happened before. First time we had halfing there was a hard fork that changed code for reword to stay at 50BTC and when we got multisig some miners refuse to mine on blocks that had multisig...
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:29:47

I found a bug in 103 already... It took me 10 minutes of thinking how code works and what needs to change. So it is not ready... Agree it will not play any role till 2021 since blocksize will be less then 2MB but it is there... net.h line 51 needs to be changed to something dynamic or max blocksize with 103... So don't call 103 done... It is not... And to get to 2MB by 2021... Is this a joke?
@_date: 2015-10-18 14:19:18
Good luck. Unless you are natural talent you will lose money...

They can change sorting... And that what they did. They used a different algorithm...
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:11:26
OK I thought you were talking about 51% attack... OK you do know where the problem with your scenario is. Exchange will not let you take that money out if they see something strange... I don't think you can organize this in secret or in just days. So someone paying for an attack will not work. But attack that kills old bitcoin and pay for it self would be something completely different and would be considered heroic from big part of community...

Well even blockstreams devs have told us that sidechaines are not a scaling solution so why is a problem to say it is not...
@_date: 2015-10-18 13:41:47
Well there is a variant of that attack. You can mine a blocks with transactions you like(or without) ignoring the network and then go back in time and transmit it about 10 seconds before the network found the next... You could use ASIC to mine blocks when there was just CPU and GPU mining... But since you are travelling you don't need speed since you have all the time in the world... You can even go back and tell yourself that you need to look at different place for a nonce so you don't waist to much electricity...
Ofcourse I'm ignoring all paradoxes...
@_date: 2015-11-21 10:32:47
No. LN will need more then that. LN will need blocks that can handle attacks on it. If you need big % of LN traffic dump on network 4MB will not work... If not small blocks are attack vector... And there are CT that are bigger then normal ones. As far as I know 10x bigger. Unless that changed... So 2 or 4 is way to small... Especially if OpenBazaar is as big of a deal as they say it will be... Even 4 is kicking the can at best... Just LN needs 133MB blocks for it to work well as global payment system if anyone play by the rules and there is no attack on it(not taking into account that you need long-lasting payment channel that are attack vector on there own)... And that is just LN... Why should LN be the only thing that can run on blockchain. What about OT? Lets make only one blocksize fork and stop. It will only get harder and harder to agree...

Hashcash doesn't make him an expert... Hi is saying BIP103 is ready. It took me 10 minutes to find a bug... P2P message limit of 2MB... net.h line 51 needs to be changed... I do agree that this would not be a problem till 2021 but guess what. If I can find a bug in 10 minutes what else is wrong with code that he is saying is ready...
EDIT: And to 2MB by 2021... Is this a joke?
@_date: 2015-10-18 20:27:08
For me that is the Bitcoin... And who are you to say that it is not. Or anyone else even me. If 50%+one agrees it is. If not then it isn't.

Agree... Some info on old page would go long way...
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:11:43
Yes but they are saying you should not use 0 conf for anything... OK. So how do I fix exchange rate then. If I have 5% margin I can't say it cost that much in BTC. Do I say it is 1BTC but add 0.2 so if the exchange rate changes. When we have 6 conformations we will see what happens. If I will have something extra I will send that back... Would that work for you?
Just suggesting a method that might drop hi fee transaction(this one can) to core devs is blasphemy...
Standard response is you should not act on 0 conf transactions and hi fee transactions can't be drooped(but they don't get drooped by whole network do they)... But this is something that can't be explained to them. I personally didn't attempted but did see others do that...

@_date: 2017-05-30 12:24:57
Can I just ask a honest question and forgive me if you already explain that somewhere. But isn't BIP148 same as any other incompatible implementation? Like XT, Classic, BU... Why do we have about 50% of all posts on front page about BIP148 but if I would promote Classic same way as BIP148 I might even get banned and post would get deleted... Without 51% miner support BIP148 is a altcoin. And even if you say EM you just told us it has no way of getting that...
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:33:02
Yes I'm correct when more users realise what your 2MB BIP do... It is even bigger BS as you HF BIP... It will have more then enough users disagreeing getting smaller blocks... It is just making more space for nonSegWit transactions but limits number of SegWit transactions and I think it is a blocksize reduction for about 0.3MB but I didn't jet look into it...
And I find it interesting you are pushing for a BIP148 to be a switch in a code(mailing list) but you are not ready to give users control over blocksize...
You are just pushing your agenda. Not giving users a choice...
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:02:07

@_date: 2015-11-23 03:25:43
OK sorry for going over the top on this.
60 days ago was the last time I have looked at LN in details.
I see so much missing and as a programer I know that last 5% are the hardest. Anyway main problem I see with LN is that you need BC that can handle settelment of a big part of PC in reasenable time. If not that is attack vector. Lock time needs to be short. You can't ask users to wait lets say 90 days on everage to get there founds. I think 7 days locktime is something that we need. And there are also small payments. Assuming 20$ BC fee. Will I dump transaction on a BC if it is less then this and I still have 90% of funds in PC? What if I don't have any BTC left outside PC and I need to buy food and locktime is 6 days away? Hubs can get hacked so we can't just say this will not heppen.

UASF and BIP148 are also binaries that are promoted under assumption that consensus has already been reached. Google it. BIP148 is second hit(first is github). UASF is the first hit.
So I realy don't see a difrence promoting BIP101(to me it is same as BIP148) or XT(for me is the same as UASF)...
EDIT: If there were not binaries on  I might bought this argument...
@_date: 2015-10-15 09:17:25

That has a BIG BUG... net.h line 51... And I would not call that implemented... It is just a function that needs to be added to code compiled... and if I found a bug in 10 minutes... Well...
And then will it be added to a core? From what I seen no unless consensus is no longer important...
Will users accept it? I don't think so. 2MB by 2021? This is a joke...


Yes and no... Even after it was pointed to him he was OK with 20MB. 8 is lucky number in China... Gavin didn't pick that number... China miners did...

@_date: 2015-10-01 00:42:35
Agree. But this one can make a lot of short-lived splits... There were miners with BIP66 still running preBIP66 code... How many orphans did we had with version 2? I think 10+ and the longest chain was around 6 blocks? Right?
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:11:11
Well not sure. There is no old chain left so I can't show it to you but I did find this:


Why using word forking block if there was no fork...
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:09:35
Yes it looks like it only almost did that and it was reported by coredev by mistake that it did that. But if that node was mining 6000 blocks per day maliciously it would do exactly that. Unfortunately there is no way for me to prove if there was or wasn't a fork. There is no node running with that code. It will also be impossible to provide a prof if the one that did this shut down his node... Situation is a same in any case. Same thing happened to core... But if there was no fork:


Why using word forking block...
@_date: 2015-10-01 20:23:12
Well again it is a thing of definition. Software was forked to use different database... It was unanticipated fork that changed consensus rules and since implementation is specification in Bitcoin...

BitReserve was never a Bitcoin company... Now it is just official.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:40:49

I used it as example because I couldn't... So your staitment is wrong. Also ~~hot~~how to install BitcoinXT was also removed... 
There is a theymos quote where he told the world that he will do everything to stop XT... And we have a quote from him saying he likes UASF. So I really don't see any difference but this one...

There is a cost for increasing blocksize. It is called orphan blocks...
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:06:04
Yes but this is still centralized... Why core devs only... I know it is close to impossible to have one user one vote but I don't see core devs  the only one who matters... I know that if they do something stupid it will not get adopted but you can't force them to do something they think should not be implemented... And you see a reaction to the XT...
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:46:55
It is same as 21 bitcoin computer... But this one doesn't cost arm and a leg... It cost about the same as normal router... You might need to reconfigure it a bit but it would work the same...

And I would not say it is all there. This is only a scenario where anyone agrees with SegWit. And if that was the case SegWit would gave 95% already... It is like playing a chess and think you are the only one who can move... This scenario is missing so many alternatives outcomes...

Point out a difference then...
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:19:21
Yes old one that don't have HF build in... You can read right? And they are stuck since none has mined with new one bigger then 1MB block...
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:49:51
By that logic every block on Bitcoin network is mined with manual workaround...
Yes it hanged and wait for transactions... That is how it was programmed... If you can't produce 1MB+ block it will be rejected... Unless you are saying you seen all config files.

@_date: 2017-05-31 06:31:39
It is not promoted. I can't see a argument where first hit under UASF is promoting specific binaries under the assumption that consensus has already been reached. What am I missing? EDIT: How is it difrent to BIP101 or XT? EDIT2: There were also how to install BIP148 and so on...

You send it to mutisig address. Than your wallet is credited after 6 conformations and then you can use it. It is converted in a moment of use... You don't own keys for multisig. It would be nice if they would upgrade to Thunder network so I could own keys. You can also use XAPO app as a Bitcoin wallet or Vault... Access over webpage and Android app. Not sure about iPhone...

How many ASIC works good on p2p? S5 can even destroy itself... I'm running my SP20 on p2p put I only have 5... There is no option for Ants...
Not sure what you are talking about a fee market. You can have one without max blocksize. But if it takes 20$ to use BTC I will use LTC. So not sure if that will work as you think it will.
Anyway when core will do nothing and there is an alternative you will see what will happen... And if in December all of the players that told us upgrade there clients to BIP101...
LN will never work as advertised if blocks are too small since that makes an attack vector. You will not be able to dump transactions on a blockchain if you got scammed for a 0.001BTC. Fee will be just to hi to close payment channel unless it was a person who scammed you the one you have payment channel open to... And what if big player stop playing by the rules. All that transactions on a BC... You need to change blocksize to something that will not give as IPv4 problem...
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:55:37

This is like giving your miners safe passwords to mine on a pool. What is the worst thing that can happen? Somebody is mining for you... The tragedy... There are theoretical attacks but none of them easy as long as you have more then one node out there and if you are really paranoid one in house just to be sure... If someone would be after you even in house node would not solve anything...

Agree. So sine the last conference was just a show... Interesting but still show with solutions that will not work near future it was a nice attempt to make it appear that solutions are ready but whan you look closer you see that are years or in bast cases year away. That why I agree that it is just a waist of time. I was told by somewhone with book next to his name about 45 days ago that OT will be out in 2 weeks. Now i know for sure that was just a Butterfly code... So that is why I don't look at this as enthing else as a show of teoretical solutions. Agree they are cool but they are not implemented...
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:59:54
No it was not. It was miners voting for BIP16 OR BIP17.

Agree about detection with softfork. But I was talking about attack vectors not detection. You know what will happen and it give you an attack vector. If it is a normal orphen block you don't know what will happen so you can't use it with any kind of certainty...
With never-ending split unless the attacker is the first use of your node after a split you will see something is off. Also small number of blocks and connected nodes... You do know you are off main chain... But you do not necessary know you are not on the right software in case of a softfork
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:37:28
on testnet but not on testnet5... As soon as testnet5 got enough transactions block was made...

Lightning can be dismissed for now from one simple reason. Even creators are saying it is a year away... So it is probably more then that... I was told that OT were just two weeks about 45 days ago... So that is Butterfly TM infringement... So my guess it that LN is also more then a year away of anything practical... For now we can say there are someone unknowns that we only know how it theoretically work. For now we don't even know how will address looked...
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:35:00
You are not infringing it. But I agree you can get sued... And problem is US law in this case. If that would happen where I live troll would had to pay legal fees for me as well... So that shit will only happen in US...

Where did it burst in flames... It was attacked by someone who made like 6000 blocks in 1 day with difrent rules... This is what it should do...
And look 
SegWit did the same thing... And yes it also should do that...

Well we know what happens to pools that mine BIP101 right? You guessed. It is DDoS. They took Slush offline...
EDIT: And yes I know code doesn't change that. That is a compiled version by someone(forgot who) for anyone who would like to run BIP101 but not XT and still show support... There is also stealth mode...
EDIT2: Anyway if we don't change blocksize to something big enough or dynamic we will end up with IPv4 problem... It still works but it is a mess...
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:26:34
Well I can't show you a fork if there was one since incompatible clients are now offline so there is no way to know but if you read words devs are saying I think there was... And potential for it was there for sure if someone would use that client to mine. So it is same in this way.
But read this. This is from a replay to somehow shows there was no fork.


Why would you say forking block if the client was just stuck... I would say there was a fork...
EDIT: And I can do a fork right now if I run old client to mine. Same thing as happened in this case. It would also happened on mainnet... Nothing new...
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:09:55
Well we don't know at what time bitcoin.conf file was modified... Miners do that before first start. So it might be just a start not a restart...
And who is saying there is no testplan. This attack moved dates from future to now... But I still don't know what would you like to test. You still didn't told me...
Waiting for HF activation is not a testplan I agree.  But if someone move it at a sooner date that is also not a problem if you are not ready since you planed it days ahead...
And thanks for concern trolling and FUD...
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:12:18
Well not sure. There is no old chain left so I can't show it to you but I did find this:
22:26:32 &lt;cfields&gt; sipa/morcos/CodeShark: as suggested by jl2012, I added the sigops-counting change to my old/busted segwit node, and verified that reconsiderblock is now happy with the forking block
Why using word forking block if there was no fork...

Not really. Default settings were but miners are using config files for years now since core is still using default size of 750kb.
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:07:55
Then attacker would use 200 ASICs... It was planed attack and has only show that code works...
@_date: 2015-11-23 18:37:36
Agree. Part that you are missing is that we could see 20$ fees for that. And we might even see that fee that is set will not be enough in a future...

I'm not sure if btc1 was mining at all at this point. 6000 blocks were mined with incompatible client that might not even be btc1... But you can start a client and test for yourself and come out with some data or stop guessing. If mining doesn't work it is easy to provide evidence... As far as I know there were not tests planed on testnet...
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:04:38

OK I forgot /s at that point since I thought it is self evident. And you should also notice that I wrote  that miners were using it at 350kb that is really close to what Luke would like to see. Miners would be using it at any size...
And I don't use just that. Even if there were no relay network I would not suffer in any way other then fees... There would be more empty blocks since xthin and compact blocks are slower but for blockhash I don't use any of thous... Getting blockhash is size independent since you only get blockhash. So again no you are clueless about how mining works and would work at any size bigger then 0... And with bigger blocks empty blocks would not be an issue... You are arguing that we can stop sea level rising by taking one bucket out...
EDIT: spelling
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:34:16
So if you need to set something that is created to be set by user it is incompatible?
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:10:36
Well it was nonevent with SegWit and it is nonevent with btc1... It was created by a incompatible client. But hire we also have a atack. There were 6000 blocks made in one day. None was ready for HF. Normal block production is 144 blocks per day...
@_date: 2015-10-01 10:00:57
Thanks. So whan will BIP101 be mearged? Or BIP100? Since all that is needed is knowing how Bitcoin works.

Good luck forking yourself... I wouldn't do it since you are not big enough...
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:46:10
You can't add 50x more hashpower to mainnet and to time travel exploit that can be done on a testnet.
And you would not have to wait that long on a mainnet for 1MB+ of transaction since there is a transaction already made.
None was ready for HF to happen so we just had to wait for someone to make necessary transactions...

@_date: 2015-10-18 08:27:53
Would not work. You need same transactions so you need blocks and transactions. People would notice that they were send without them sending them... And this is not what you were asked. How long would it take for a laptop from future to be able to 51% today's network.
EDIT: There is also max timedrift...

You always had display issues with conformations. So this is taking a long time. I have send some bugs in beta testing time together with pictures(including conformations). Some are all still there... As far as I can see only one was fixed...
BTW why 6 conformations. If I send 0.001BTC one should be more then enough... For 0.01 two and some reassemble limits up to 6.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:40:52
Yes. And you don't even need a bunch of them. Just one with a lot of IPs would do...
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:59:45
Till about half a year ago it was the same. Not 100% sure what version broke it... Now it will not shutdown even if you live it for 30 minutes... Even deleted the chain... Didn't help... And I'm not the only one with that experience... Could be something connected to win version. I have win server 2008 R2 x64... I think win 7 is based on that.
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:44:51
So your point is it works as it should and that is a problem? And you do know there is a over 100BTC fee bounty transaction ready for first bigger then 1MB block that will only fit in block that is bigger then 1MB right?
Anyway. If a hard fork bit was used nullc would call a different problem. Miners can fake it...
So that is kind of no win situation...
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:28:45

@_date: 2017-07-10 23:21:55
Yes but at that point you need someone to test a network. And HF might not happen for days since no miner is ready to take first step. This forces this step to happen. So we are saved from a lot of uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:51:21

@_date: 2017-07-12 08:28:30
Go on github open a issue and propose it... Explain why is it needed and if it turns out you have good arguments I'm sure they will do it... But do test just to do tests... That is just a propaganda move...
I also didn't see any core testplans but I truest they are there...
Chain stalling issue only showed that it works nothing else.
Let assume there is a test plan and HF test was planed on 15th since with 144 blocks per day that would be a day it would happen... Then someone mines 6000 blocks in a day and move HF 5 days. And since the plan was that tools needs to be ready on 13th and they will coordinate on 14th... So you see my point?
Testnets stall all the time. They even go offline and start from first block... Why is this a dealbreaker for you? You know this is testnet5 right? Do you even know where are all others testnets? Do you care? Do you look at them?
This is only news since from my guess this was a coordinated attack used for FUD about SegWit2x... Nothing has gone wrong... It is nonevent.

BIP91 would not activate SegWit or 2MB fork. So no...
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:46:40
So it is not done. You wrote the steps needed for this to be anyting more then just explanation with code... It could be in C, C++, VB or J++ or php or B or assembler or... It would not make any difference. It is still a working code not implemented... So your point. I already explain that it looks like we call this staff differently. But do I really need to link you to a implemented code? This is function. And it will NOT WORK when size is biger then 2MB since max P2P was dropped from 32MB to 2MB. So this is not a BIP code!!! It is only code representation how this would work. Go look at the code. And I'm sure it is also missing some other parts. Like do we fork or not... So don't give me it is OK it will work. It will not!!! This is not the whole BIP just a small part of it. I really can't think of a reason why you don't know that.

No phone so I didn't read it cerfuly... But general point is that there is no longer a botlenack there. We now have at least 2 networks that sends blocks to and from china as fast as the rest of the world.
Also only mining nodes needs to get blocks fast. The rest don't care. So datacenter is realistic scenario. My mining node can get data from any china pool in same time size independent for me to start mining on a new block. It only takes me time to get full block to start adding transactions to my block. And FRN and xthin are able to get me that data in about 10% of the time it took befor that...

You are unbelievable... I give you an example that they have chips that do ASICBOOST and give you evidence that it makes no sense to do covert ASICBOOST and now you are saying they are doing regular ASICBOOST. Yes this is how it works. If they have chips that can do covert ASICBOOST there chips can also do regular ASICBOOST. That profit is not part of covert ASICBOOST but just ASICBOOST that you need to have covert ASICBOOST...

@_date: 2017-07-11 01:35:37
Found another reason for that:
See Jeff's post 11 days ago in   (comment)
A hardfork bit would require SPV nodes to update whereas a &gt;1 mb block would not. A &gt;1mb block is strictly the distinction between the legacy client and s2x client's, so it logically works as a requirement.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:57:33
yes 80% but there are prerelised versions wout there that have all the signalling but no HF programmed... Someone is using that. Or fake btc1 client... Who knows...
Yes it is working as intended. As long as there is no block bigger then 1MB smaller then 1MB blocks are not allowed and will be rejected. Testnet is diffident then mainnet. There is not a lot of miners if any at any given time. So at the moment someone just started up a old version without HF or is using fake btc1 for FUD. And it worked...
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:57:33
Well and it looks like it is working as intended in this case... You could add that...
Link to someone who copy/paste specification for you: 
It is a non-event since it did what it shuld do. And it looks like it was an attack. Normally you see 144 blocks per day... There ware 6000 blocks mined. And code worked as intended... Wipeout protection works... I would call this is a fantastic success, in the worst possible situation it does exactly what it is supposed to do.
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:44:22
Well nothing crashed. And F1 is still running on it but it is now ignored. But since F1 was so much faster and track was looking at the fastest care drivrs of a radio controlled cars were not ready for a new race in time. That is way we had to wait...

@_date: 2017-07-18 18:27:40
Yes and following this logic bit4 might not activate BIP91...
Bit4 activate SegWit2X if you run the righ client. Same as running right client only activate BIP91. Or nothing if you run something else... So your point is? If some miners back off of this there would be war...

Sorry there is no orphan chain to show you so I have to use words of core devs. And cfields is saying forking block if they really figure it out there was no fork and client was only stuck...
And if we are talking about segnet and testnet we should be talking about testnet5... You are impossible...
And I can fork a segnet right now with an old version of SegWit if that is needed to prove a point. It will fork on block 22130 or 22132... It will prove same thing this proves...

Segwit. All that is needed is changing signalling bit and activation threshold... minus of work...

Took 2 offline since DDoS attacks on BIP101 nodes(but will not run core any more unless they change blocksize) and running only one on really Hi speed line. But it is windows server and it looks like core devs don't care to much of making it work good. So it not as stable as it was...
 and that is the attitude... Will not run a Linux machine just for that...
EDIT: That DDoS cost network about 400 or more new nods...
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:23:41
Yes since you need bigger then 1MB block. You are dishonest right now...
EDIT: Old implementation that is mining has no HF build in... Anyone knows who read anything on btc1 knows that. I would not be surprised is someone did that to make this post...
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:31:08
Yes and how is this a problem then? It is a default setting but not something you can't change in config file...
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:46:45
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:17:33
Point to part of a code that will not allow you. You are talking about user editable default settings.
So no you are the one doing that. None was ready with transactions and probably none had change settings since HF came much earlier then expected... But this is user editable setting not hardcoded...

bit4 activate SegWit2x and nothing else... SegWit2x then activate BIP91... 
EDIT: Now I see. You would like another signalling? bit4 is the signalling... But I agree that 2MB fork should not happened if bit4 doesn't activate... In that case I don't see miners running btc1 anyway...

Pathents don't prevent users to use them. Only thing patent holder can say is who can make staff(miners having ASICBOOST) using there patent. Once it is approved. For now it is not AFAIK... And I don't think it will be do to prior art. ASICBOOST is just a bogieman...

OK you got that point. But since in normal conditions HF would not happened yet I'm guessing none was ready for it. There was not transactions and it looks like only Garzik had the right settings...
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:51:57
ROTLOL. You do need to look at some maps... About size of Germany or France... And since small block size is removing people off Bitcoin(and there are small blockers that say this is OK) I have no problem saying if you can't don't use it. There are altcoins... If bitcoin is not for someone who lives on 1$ per day it is not for someone on poor internet. But then again they don't need to run a node at home or at all...

Plus you edited that so much just to make me look stupid. It is clear that you will not tell the truth. That makes me think this is orchestrated attack since you are using expected beehive as a bug...
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:48:19
Read a code. Someone attacked testnet with eough hashing power to produce 6000 blocks in one day(normal 144 blocks)... That is not just 51% attack. That is 99% attack... You can't do that on mainnet but can testnet is much easier since it has a difficulty reset rules and low difficulty. Sometimes you can CPU mine it...

Don't know I'm not a dev but since code worked as it should. I don't see a problem if this happens in testnet...
I guess since none was mining for tests at that time none was watching...
And no since at there will be miners on mainnet. And there is a 273BTC+ fee transaction ready for first 1MB+ block... So it can't happen on mainnet...
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:24:28

@_date: 2017-07-12 08:58:09
OK. There is a small problem with some of your ideas but I don't think it is a big deal... I think only btc1 can connect to testnet5... But then again I never used testnet with anything else then default settings. So it might be posible to run any client with some additional options...

 I hope that is also not to manually for you...

HF happened days to early so there were no SPAM transactions ready to make big enough block and that was the only problem. The rest worked as it should. And it give core devs some FUD to put out...
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:21:45
So code did what it should do right? So coding is fine. How is that incompetent? Your point is that  they shuld protect testnet better? Why? Should they use 20% of mainnet hashing power since that is a theoretical attack... By that logic coredevs are incompetent too. It happened to SegWit too. Someone was running incomparable(older version) client there to... So either everyone is incompetent or none is... Your choice...
@_date: 2015-11-23 02:08:30
Add small blocks that are full. You are missing this part. What heppens then?
Who was talking about micropayment? That is a problem on it own if it needs to be dumped to blockchain.
We have no idea how routing will work and everage user will care only how much it cost.
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:57:45
Don't see how. Miners showed they don't care. Luke give up on a concept of wipeout risk and made HF with POW change so it would do nothing to BTC but we would have a Luke coin... So SegWit2x give you an olive branch to safe face... But as I suggested it will be reinterpreted as victory to stop 2MB part... Original plan was bit4 would only be needed to activate SegWit... No bit1.
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:30:00
Still you can make a transaction just in case...
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:51:16
Well old version did make core dev think it did. And if that client would mine 6000 blocks in a day maliciously it would...
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:35:21
Well when mempool got 1MB+ transaction in block followed soon so I guess someone already did have this settings in config file... And no you don't need to change configuration option to unstuck a block. You need to change configuration options to make block bigger then 1MB. You can do that ahead of time since client will not make a bigger block without it...
@_date: 2017-07-04 09:36:48
Really? Saying that 1MB is way to big but 4MB with SegWit is OK even if we have to force a chainsplit?
And there were no need for BIP148 if Luke would do what he promised to miners. If he didn't had that mandate he shouldn't be there...
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:34:51
I'm talking in SegWit2x terms... And read what I'm replaying to and explain to him that he is clueless... Bit1 signaling comes later in a game...
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:54:58


I am still saying they were talking about FPGA(and there was a problem in translation to english)... but they were getting ready to implement it to something...
And I really like that about experts. I just know it can be done... And then finding a "demonstration" shows it can't even be replicated... But I'm open to possibility there is a chip out there... Just not the one we are talking about or the way we were told...
And I also find it strange that core devs are saying we need to disable ASICBOOST since it is evil but now that I think... You are right... SegWit will not solve covert ASICBOOST adding additional prof that I was right in calling it boogeyman... and was just a smear campaign to force SegWit...
Also look at what we have for antminers and you are saying we would not have a ASICBOOST activation?
And there is a lot more...
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:57:39
So somehow he can't even make them signal EC but he controls them... LOL
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:17:22
There is already 1MB+ transaction with 100+BTC fee ready...
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:50:41
Small sample size... And there is a bias. Naming it after Luke or running it on his server will make sure his supporters will be answering and his opponents will not... Especially if they have to give access to there Coinbase account... If ti were on Antpool I'm sure there would be a different outcome..
@_date: 2017-07-10 23:53:57
Yes but didn't a same thing happened hire too? Old softver and 6000 blocks at the time none was using testnet...
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:14:53
Yes but then garzik say it is not and it is working as it should...
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:09:27
Not true: Source: Google...  you can do it for lend lines yourself...
It is also interesting to see this maps...
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:13:15
So how did they mine block soon after they got enough transaction in mempool? User can set this in a config file so you don't need to edit any code.
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:41:47
If you think there is not enough details about it and have good arguments for some test I wold say yes... It is a open source project and anyone can put in his 2 cents... There might be a testplan already out there and it is just not public or it is but you just don't know a location. And if you have good ideas they might add some of yours... But just to say run tests is not enough. Linking a webpage where I could not find any test by clicking on 3 links is also not OK...
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:51:45
If it would be easy someone would done that. It might even be that someone did that and figure out it doesn't work... That why we don't have a working example...
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:49:43
No. That would be done in any blocksize bigger then 0. Miners care how fast they get new block and will use most efficient system. If centralised system become a problem they will use something else.
@_date: 2017-07-10 23:00:41


I think that will be first one that will get mined...
nVersion will not make sure there is a HF. Miners can still make blocks smaller then 1MB. 1MB+ make sure there is a HF... That is what I'm taking about and think nullc was also talking about...
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:16:42
BU will not had enough mining power to be relevant... It would be same as core at that time...
And I'm not saying it is impossible to join BU to testnet5. I'm just saying it might need some modifications in config or even code. If it is a core it is a bit harder...
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:51:39
Only if it is put in production without a warning that you need to change setting before HF... Before HF it is following default core policy...
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:43:03
Yes I agree... But like 1MB+ more...
@_date: 2016-05-30 16:38:07
Yes it is a nice way to buy staff with BTC if you stop using banks like I did. It is so easy now in EU. Cashila and XAPO is all you need...
EDIT: I like it is nominated in BTC not EUR or USD. The only thing I don't like is 6 conf. You could make that dynamic. Like 1 for up to 0.1 BTC, 2 for 1 BTC, 3 for 10 BTC... You get the idea... I hold my BTC on myTrezor and paper...
EDIT2: Would also love to see it on NFC phones...
@_date: 2017-07-10 23:11:56
Yes but not the same as main net. Difficulty gets reseted to starting one every 20 minutes if there is no blocks are found... So you can find 2016 blocks really fast. And then wait 20 minutes to start again...
EDIT: Sorry reading the code wrong... It will not reset difficulty for 2016 blocks but just 1 block. But you can do timetravel exploit too and mine blocks that way too...
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:12:40
OK so point out to a code then.
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:00:26
Why? Did your transaction got stuck... This is testnet. It gets stuck fir days and weeks...
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:38:34
Yes but miners this days set thos things. Look at mainchain. All blocks are 1MB. Default setting in core is 750kb. Unless you are saying none is using core... Problem would be if this was a production code and there were no warning about this. It is clear that at lest one person on testned did have right setting set and that is good enough for testnet...
EDIT: Only problem was that none was ready for this and make spam transactions since someone mined 6000 blocks in this attack and put HF forward in time...
@_date: 2015-10-17 21:57:13
How come none of the seen that some are fake?

EDIT: Someone mined 6000 blocks in a day... It looks like attack to me... Normal is 144 That is about 40x that
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:06:12
Someone who would like to spread some FUD about SegWit2x. 6000 blocks with incompatible client in one day(normally 144 blocks)...
But SegWit2X code worked as it should and activated Wipeout protection. So it is a fantastic success, in the worst possible situation and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.
Same thing happened with SegWit. Incomparable(old version) forked testnet. But at that time it was probably not an attack...

@_date: 2017-07-27 06:41:08
Why would I calculate fees in invalid blocks? They need to loss more then they gain. And they do... Even without blockrewards that were lost...
Me too. "instructions" or "how-tos"(if you can't figure that part out) are referring to files that are not there... They are fake... Unless I have a difrent version of S7s and S9s...
I did not look at invalid blocks only valid and none is showing anything fishy... But you are right. This two do... So at worst they were testing something new as I predicted in my other posts... Like a new chip... And it also shows that covert ASICBOOST is a nightmare as I did say and you disagreed...
At the moment absolutely nothing... If they get patent granted(as far as I know there is a 20 years old prior art) then they might do something. But prior art is a problem for this patent... But then again USPO is corrupt/incompetent enough to pass it anyway... For now the only thing that can happen is they get temporally court ruling... But I don't see it happening do to prior art...

You should know that. How much it cost to make a 16nm chip... Are profits enough to make it.

You clearly don't know how mining works. You can't use nonce to mine any block. It works only on EXACTLY THE SAME BLOCK it was used for. If you change one transaction or timestamp or anything it will no longer work... So you can't even change coinbase transaction. If that were not the case pool mining would not work since you would use nonce you found and send a bitcoins to yourself... Also once you brodcast the blocks every miner or even node would use it to create a block to pay him...
EDIT: Also if all you need is a nonce you could rewrite all the history of a blockchain with just them... But that is clearly not a case...
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:50:15
You do know SegWit had same problem right?
Edit: It was someone using incompatible software(old version) on a testnet

Wrong... It has minutes. It only needs block hash. Than it can wait for a block mining a empty block. Wham a block comes it has time to verify it and start filling new block. So only hash that is bites is impotent to miners. And you should know that... Everyone who knows how mining works now a days knows that. F2Pool has about 50s+ as far as know. That why we have empty blocks. So blocksize will not make any difference. More empty blocks maybe that that is it...

@_date: 2017-07-04 15:04:15
So blocks are send in a compressed form right? No. From mining standpoint it is the same... (EDIT: Well no it is not. It makes mining less secure since you can skip SegWit block assuming it is OK since big blocks are somehow a problem)
Luke made 300kb HF about 1 year after deadline. For me only working code counts. How is that 2MB fork? OK yes it will be in a year 20.000 or something like that /s... How much was SegWit late? And if he could not make any promises he should not go there. That means he didn't had a mandate to be there as a coredev...
Miners did nothing until agreement start changing... And even after that F2Pool just send a signal but did not do anything that would invalidate agreement. He was using core and just change some parameters to signal Classic...
So if you plan to call me a lair put some links hire... And I will show you why I think you lie...

It is a non-event and you know it or you should not be a coredev since you can't read code.

@_date: 2017-07-25 06:31:03
Yes that is why I told you to read it carefully... If you take this in vacuum and don't know this was probably translated... It is also clear that they figure out months later what this smear campaign was about...
They say support not have. And if you know how ASIC is working you know there is something lost in translation. ASIC can do 1 thing and nothing else. If it can do 2 things silicon needs to be 2x the size and use 2 times the power... So unless they have 2 chips this makes no economic seance...
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:27:35
Yes old implantation that is mining will not produce it since it has no bigger then 1MB blocks build in. Why are you so dishonest right now.
EDIT: Same thing would happen with testnet if core implement HF and someone start mining with preHF client and none is mining with HF client... This is just wipeout protection..

So we have a mining expert... Great I was told so many times by experts how mining works that I would go broke if I would listen to them... And having experts say Bitman chips can ASICBOOST and are ASICBOOST capable. Can you set this shit up for me then? No covert ASICBOOST is needed. I will do overt. Just enable it on my S9 and S7. I will do the rest... I do get this low margin FUD since miners don't like competition but it is not that bad as experts make it sound to be... The only time I had a problem was when I still was paying 0,1€/KW and had a lot of 2 years old miners(had some financial difficulty and used BTC that I should reinvest)... 200$ was when I moved to hydro power plant and start to make profit again 0,04€/KW... But yes current price spike is nice but far from needed I'm sure I would be fine if the price was only in 400$ range to...

It is pretty much clear that the moment they made transactions needed block was created...
There is a explanation why hadfork bit was rejected by them so stop with that. And it is clear that there will be no mempool problem on mainnet since there is a bounty transaction already made...
And at this point you are a FUD machine not a core dev...

@_date: 2017-07-23 18:29:59
I was arguing that adding BIP91 to SegWit2x is wrong message to BIP148 extremists and they will take that olive branch and turn it into victory for them and told everyone that 2MB will never happens since they will "UASF" 2MB out of existence. It had nothing to to with BIP148 argument was we could just play nice. Miners got what they signed on HKC and resigned in NYA with SegWit2x...

It is the livest of all blocksize BIP's. Even BIP100 with all miners support is more dead that BIP101 since there is no code and it is no longer posible to fork mainnet by 11th of Jan... Thestnet fork time is far in past... So I guess it was just a distraction for miners...
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:31:38
Well someone used a old or maybe not even a btc1 version of software. Made a tone of incompatible block at the time when testnet was not used. And we have and attacking this non-event. They can read code. They know it is a nonevent but they are attacking like crazy... So no direct but a lot of indirect evidence...
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:43:32
Depends how long are they doing this but I don't think so... And for now there is not even any evidence that anyone is doing this or even that there is a chip out there that can do that... Only think is some code in S9 that show it might do that and Bitman saying they were testing that on a testnet. But they didn't say if they used FPGA or there chips... My guess is FPGA since none showed that in action...

No. It is a miner not upgrading and puting locked BTC in a block that will be rejected. Or if you are taking 0 conf just a  a use of locked BTC.

Well yes it has. Same thing happened hire. The only difference is that that node mine 6000 blocks in one day... It should be 144 by all the nodes. So btc1 nodes faced 51% attack that was more 99.9% attack...

Jesus. You do know how forks work right. Show me this fork
and this one
It looks like it never happened on a chain. So I guess it is a lie too right?
That why I'm saying they are talking about a fork not stuck client. Not a block where a client got stuck but a forking block... Nullc came with no fork defence after about 1 hour. And hire you can read about a fork not stuck client as well and this is a explanation post that was posted  to defend core.




But there was no fork that can be seen at this point... I can run that client and see if it will fork... And it will. So that is what happened hire. Someone did intentional fork... No difference at all...
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:55:14
Unless you have any evidence showing other way...
And yes you are right. Intervention was needed. Transactions had to be generated...
I'm sure it had to be modified and started at some point. Same as core client for mining... Your point?
I'm sure they will be once they will start using it.
Why not? And what test would you like to see? This one worked as it should even if it was not planed to happen yesterday...
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:41:43
Nope. You are dishonest. Node mining has no HF so it can't HF. There is no code for that. Read what is going on... It is clear that there is no bigger then 1MB block that is needed after HF activate so that is why they are stuck. This is expected since it has condition as wipeout protection... If someone activated HF without right software I would say it could be done for FUD reasons... Dragon den anyone?
EDIT: You added 2 paragraphs and added a lot to first one without marking that to make me look stupid... I can't debate you like that. It is clear that you are just using FUD...

@_date: 2017-07-25 11:52:17
That is code from a controler. That only shows plans to add them and add testing for FPGA...
And yes it is. You need GPUs for calculating hashes and new protocol for distributing work that is covert ASICboost enabled or disabeld or your asics will turn on and off all the time...
EDIT: would like to see someone use a chip to do that in real life not just see some code and say I am right... Showing a negative is imposible but showing a positive is easy. .
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:22:00
I thik he is lying. He come up with no fork defence about 1 hour later and if you look at this link
I don't see stuck client anywhere...
And if we look at this
They are talking about fork... I don't see stuck client... But I do see this:




There is no evidence since that client were changed


But again forking block....
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:22:42
BIP148 is saving face is you ask me(and Core too who is saying this is just BIP91 and not SegWit2x)... You are right. The only reason why SegWit was blocked is Core not making 2MB HF... And now miners bypassed core and make SegWit2X that do what core will not do even if they promised... Now I will get attacked that they did non such thing and that Luke and Adam had no way to promised that... Than they were misleading miners to stop Classic...
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:26:27
No. Someone run incompatible version and fork away... And also mine 50x faster then normal... And I don't think that his rocket explanation worked...

No he didn't. It is a setting that can be changed with config file... This is how miners are doing it since core has default blocksize of 750...
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:45:33
Found this so I think this is a reason:
See Jeff's post 11 days ago in   (comment)
A hardfork bit would require SPV nodes to update whereas a &gt;1 mb block would not. A &gt;1mb block is strictly the distinction between the legacy client and s2x client's, so it logically works as a requirement.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:44:21
Yesterday I took one of S7 and one of S9(with old firmware and even used "first edition" of firmware and after that all others) and could not make it work. There are some "instructions" on net. Problem is that they are referring to file I can't find and lines that are not in file that I guess do the same thing(cgminer.conf vs bmminer.conf). I agree that they might be removed but post was 3 mounts old and I bought them long before that. I think there is a good reason no other pool supports ASICboost. It just not in chips. There is a pinout. I agree. There is SW ready(maybe) but not the way presented ( And why there is no how to anywhere?

"Even 1 MB blocks are already clearly dangerous to Bitcoin."
How? So bitcoin is somehow in danger with 1MB blocks... But he is pushing BIP148 that takes blocks by his mathematics to 2-4MB. How anyone can take him seriously. The amount of mental gymnastic needed is beyond me.

1. If they did why are they just talking what they think code dose.
2. It might. But what is posibly going on is that 1Hash attempted to speed up or adjust their extranonce grinding by swapping transaction orderings. It is possible that 1Hash is somehow the only one using asicboost but everyone missed it in the statistic scraping that was done looking for asicboost evidence, and that 1Hash screwed up their code badly enough that it produced invalid blocks.
3. I'm not saying pools would do it. I'm saying peoples screaming that ASICBOOST is the biggest threat to bitcoin ever... Don't you find that strange
4. I already explained that... They tested ASICBOOST not covert ASICBOOST and if you read cheerfully you can figure out there are parts that makes no seance unless you think there are mistakes in translation... And also Bitmain figuring out mounts later what they were accused of...
EDIT: Also googleing it... There should be commands posted (according to some core devs) but somehow they can't be found by google... Interesting right? And there would be HOW-TOs on a bitcointalk for sure...

Yes but you add additional splits that you know that presoftfork nodes will not detect and are predictable. With normal splits the attack is harder since you don't know what will happen and when... Also with never-ending split you see something is off in your node but not with fast-ending...

No I need to run btc1 since Core or Unlimired is not connected to testnet5. And I really don't plan to compile it now... OK I don't know command lines options for connecting to testnet but I don't think it is posible to change seeds and maybe ports(not sure what else might be different). Also runing Core would get me blacklisted after 27070 so I would not know what is a state of btc1 mempool...
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:41:01
And what failure might that be. It works like designed. Only problem at the moment is that there is not transactions on it to make a 1MB+ block since this should not happened for days or even weeks and none was ready for it...

@_date: 2017-07-01 13:38:39
Sorry but no. I can tell you as a miner I would use it for any size bigger then 0. Everyone is using it at 1MB so I guess blocks are too big right? You do know everyone were using it at average blocksize of 0.35MB and would be using it sooner if it were out there? So that is to big. Also the moment a centralised system becomes a problem for miners they would use something else. Why do users use Coinbase and not LocalBitcoins? Centralisation risks are acceptable to them. I personalty don't use LocalBitcoins since you need cash and I don't like to get robed or loose to much time. But let me just tell you. If Coinbase becomes a problem I might use LocalBitcoins... But miners do no use only this system. They are also using fake stratums, xthin blocks, compact blocks(this two are decentralised), GBT and so on... Miners care about speed and for anything bigger then 0 they will use most efficient(fastest?) way. Users have different incentives and should use what they prefer... If they get a block in 9 minutes that is still OK for them... So even with maximal of 8MB block you can still use dial-up as long as you have unlimited minutes of connection...

And I did read it. How nice is to use assumptions that will make sure you get what you would like to get... He has no idea how mining works in real world. I think big % of coredevs don't...
Now if you are arguing that for future where there is no block reword big miners would make nothing if they would put out a block with there transactions but if they use transactions they got from a network there will be on a network... If you are talking now they would also lost a lot of BTCs... So how this works again?

Soft fork is a fork where you change the rules in a way that old node will follow as long as it has 51% hashing power. Problem is that it looks like BIP148 will only have a 1% hashing power. Till now all soft forks had 95% hashing power so they were safe since all splits died in hours...(less then 5% of hashing power). In case of BIP148 this is not a case. So old nodes will not follow BIP148 chain but nonBIP148 chain. That is why it looks like a hard fork.

And activation of SegWit would timeout...
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:24:03
It is pretty much clear that it will be 17 at best... 83% signed SegWit2MB... So in best case scenario you will get SegWit... Anything less. Timeout before activation...

@_date: 2017-06-07 06:17:52
It has 50% more hashpower... How? I see. You assume normal mining... I assume reorg attack... So 25,5% will not double hashing power but just add 0,5%... So we are talking 25,5 vs 49,5%... I see that BIP148thers didn't even think of the easiest of the attacks...
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:24:12
SegWit2x worked...
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:50:48
nVersion can be faked and HF is not sure at that point. If you have a bigger then 1MB block it is sure... It is clear as day to me...
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:03:48
OK it looks like you don't know this 


Now with less then 1% of hashing 0,25 to 0,3% how long will that 16 hours 40 minuts take?
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:19:56
Your point? Core also doesn't make 1MB blocks with default settings but miners change that...
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:22:30
And they are also saying that it worked just fine and that they don't think it is a bug or a problem on a mainnet... I would agree since there will not be a 50x speedup and there is already transaction that can be used...

covert ASICBOOST has so many moving parts that... Runing 100 ASICs makes a non issues with home mining a nightmare... Runing 1000 makes things even worst... I only have 45KW in mine but I need a computer just to control and monitor on them... and then it needs to control temperature and power usage to make sure is the same or less then generator... To add another moving part... NO...
I was reading prior art. Can't find that right now but was linked in a article about ASICBOOST when it came out. Or coredev mailing list. Or... Can't remember right now. It is 2 years away... Method was not discovered by ASICBOOST inventor... But I'm not sure if USPO is corrupt enough that adding word BTC would be enough to say there is no prior art...
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:02:55
Only if a exchange list it(but it will never be anything else as a internal token). With that hashpower it can't be anything else... It is too big of a risk for them... If they can't send it out or know if they received it... 
And miners will swich only if a payout is posible. Less then 1 block means it will take over 100 days to spend coinbase(you need 100 conformations). No miner can wait that long...
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:20:45
The only way you are right abou this is if bitcoin fails. Bigger blocks will happen. Unless you disagree with core rodmap... and that would make you a smallblock extreamest.

By that logic BIP148 is impossible...
33% is not totally immune. 51% is... You don't get game theory but that is a advanced topic... What you don't get is that you can let legecy chain reorg and then make another reorg back to legacy... And there are also steps to make SegWit chain in danger of being wipe out... Mine a SwgWit chain with empty blocks disconnected from main net. Every 5 or 10 blocks reorg it... What will that do to mining power? The moment they see hashing power missing on main chain they will be afraid of this... That is why I say you need 25% minimum...
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:21:53

You do know how much 10 minuts of mining cost? Who would risk that... Even at 10% I don't think there are a lot of miners ready to wait for 10 days on a blockchain that can get reorged at any time and might even die... At any price...

@_date: 2017-06-02 09:30:31
Depends on hashpower... I think 25% is a minimum... It is probably enough to be secure agents 51% reorg attacks. After that is up to exchanges. If you have a big one onbord there is a chance that price would be higher for this coins then the other. After that if we assume miners would no attack in more coordinated stile it has a shot...
Alternative is that BIP148 do a hardfork to different POW...
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:42:23
51% attack... That is why I think 25% is minimum. 33% is close to immune but I think 25% would be enough... But even at 33% it might be just a ETH Classic chain if there is no big exchange to support it... So it will make no seance to mine unless politically motivated and ready to burn money...
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:09:56
You do know that some miners have GPU farms too... And some have pledged that they will make sure that that will fail too... I make more from mining with GPUs them ASICs... Income in about 50/50 but I need about 10% of power for ASIC to power GPUs...
Anyway at a point of POW HF you are altcoin...
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:32:36
Really? How so? 0,3% of hashing power that can make less then 1 block per day. How will that work? 4 years+ to first difficulty change. 150 days for miners to get paid... And SegWit timeout 4 years before first posible lock-in period...
It was not UASF that happened in LTC. It was a consensus... SegWit signalling started right after that. Same as with BTC SegWit2x...
I'm starting to hope after seeing all this comments that just one of the SegWit2x signatures delays signalling just enough for BIP91 to not activate in time so all BIP148 fanatic would fork off and see what happens...
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:53:58
OK I reread it... There was just one mistake that I fixed... Wrote it on a phone...
What I'm saying is that if you find a block you will win a loto. But there is a big change you will not find any... After activation there is a big chance that activation will time out before activating SegWit... But that a different story... I'm just suggesting a solution that will give mines some income...
To make such a small pool make any seance you need to make it a p2pool node...
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:46:08
I think SegWit will only active if they gets 18% of mining power or something like that or will time out...
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:30:18
But what happens when a music stops and you realize that you have none playing? 0.3% is less then a block per day so you will never had SegWit... Even if all noneSegWit2x miners would support SegWit you might not get it. So you need to hope that all SegWit2x miners will play nice with you and implement everything in time...
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:11:18


What about chain abandonment? At this moment you have about 1% hashrate. That is about 1 block a day and no way to activate SegWit unless you get 15 to 17% but to be sure it will activate you need much more... You do know why right?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:41:41
No you are 100% wrong. How I know? I'm bigblocker and I'm OK with reasonable fees... I would like to have bigblocks and no blocklimit to make sure we will not have this dabate every year... We all know that if bitcoin succeed and everyone is using it even with LN and half a year channels we still need 133GB blocks... And I know it will be harder and harder to change that so it needs to be done ASAP...
EDIT: Also I don't get argument that everyone should be able to run a node but that person can't send transaction since it cost more then running a node... Than it makes no seance to run a node...
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:18:56

@_date: 2017-06-07 07:03:42
You don't. You use 25,5. And since you do a reorg original 25% is wiped out. So total hashpower is no longer 100% but just 75% since BIP148 hashing power is reorged...
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:39:01
Also for BIP148 to activate SegWit BIP148 would need about 15 to 18% of hashpower... If not SegWit would timeout making BIP148 pointless...

80%+ hashpower and economic majority of bitcoin companys agreed to make SegWit2x and bypassed core who was not ready to make a compromise. They will signal that with bit 4(look at version bits for more details). Core asked if they can also signal bit 1 and they agreed to when they get to 80% to make sure there will not be a BIP148 split. They agreed to this since they are implementing SegWit anyway(SegWit part of the plan is same) but bit 4 means not only SegWit but also 2MB blocks. So this will also activate HF to 2MB 3 months later. So I'm not sure how USAF did anything and understand your confusion...
EDIT: They are implementing

Asicboost is optimization. Unless you are ready to call going from CPU to GPU to ASIC a bug. Also going from 110nm to 16nm would also be a bug... Also Bitmain patent is still pending and it is only for China. This is just BS. Also ASICBOOST is about 20 years old optimization of SHA256...
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:19:31
Well not wipeout but there is a big chance it will die if there is not at least about 25% of mining power on it and at least one big exchange...
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:09:14
:) There are alternatives to fix it... And do you know how patents work? Anyone with that hardwere can use it. So go buy a Bitmain miner and demonstrate who it works. Problem is that ASIC is Application Specific Integrated Circuit. If you would like to sell that it can do this it can't do the other without adding second ASIC in it... And that makes no economic seance... So you will soon figure out Covert ASICBOOST is BS... Bitmain tested ASICBOOST on testnet with FPGAs... If they would do that with current chips they would only work with Covert ASICBOOST pools... If it works with any pool then it doesn't have it or have two ASIC in a chip... EDIT: also there is no indication in firmware that it has a Covert ASICBOOST. It looks like firmware is ASICBOOST ready but that is it... To anyone who is saying they reverse enginere a chip(Greg) they are BSing... Even with all the equipment that cost millions that would take a really long time... Chips are not out long enough...
Anyway. SegWit2mb would solve that. And they are ready to go even forther with Bitmain agreeing if they get a mandate. Disabling any ASICBOOST.
DAO was theft ASICBOOST is optimisation. Was a ASIC also a BUG? Or going from 110nm to 65nm to 55nm to 40nm to 28nm to 18nm to 16nm?
So this is realy a load of BS propaganda... Just not sure if you are brainwashed or part of a propaganda machine...

@_date: 2017-07-27 09:45:33
It not a simple question. Blocknumber... But on average they would lost more then savings...
 Fees 1.28842569. Assuming 0.004BTC fee per top 256 transactions(it is much less since there are less then 30 transactions with bigger fee but to be safe and no need to make a script) thy would lost 0,5 BTC... Or about 33% in fee. Again lets be conservative since that block migh not be representing all. How much do they save again? 10K. What is 33% of the fees? 43K? Even if I'm off by 4x they are still loosing money...
45KW is a nightmare to control and making sure it runs. having it wake you up in a middle of a night is not as fun as you think... So for now I have no plans...
I will google it later... Problem is that I need to look at pre 2017 ASICBOOST propaganda that is on front 1000 pages of google...
EDIT: You need to assume that top 256 transactions have 93% of fees to brake even
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:32:47
You do know how patents work? I guess not based on that answer... But I'm not going to teach you since you would just told me that I don't know what I'm talking about... Go and google that part.

They were not frightened in any way. They just agree to a plan to increase capacity and are OK with core to make it compatible with BIP148 as long as it can be done in a way it doesn't interfere with there plan... So I would not push luck saying staff like that. You need only one pool to say I we will show you BIP148 and start signalling not ASAP but as late as posible and BIP148 will fork itself off without any hashpower...
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:42:01
And with 10% SegWit will not activate but timeout... It needs 18%...
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:31:56
It can work with less but will not activate SegWit (EDIT: because conditions for activation(95% of last 1000 blocks) will not be meet till timeout)... But just to point out so this is not misunderstood. I might made a mistake in calculation...
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:02:16
It needs 18% to activate SegWit... 25% would make it somewat safe and it would need 33% to make it "save" but to make it safe 51%, so he is really dishonest...
With 1% 1 block would take more then 1 day and 100 days for miners to get paid. If that is somehow safe... No miner would wait 100 days to get paid...
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:33:43
If you say so.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:32:53
You need 18% or SegWit will time out... And max difficulty change is 25% so it will take 4 years to first one 3 years to second one and so on... I don't think many miners would jump in...
You have to pay electric bill every month...
EDIT: and that is 7 years with only 4032 blocks... No miner would say this is a good idea...
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:53:59
That is why I'm saying you don't know subject matter good enough. What I'm saying is that if Antminers would have ASICBOOST they would not work on any pool but Antpool unless they would have 2 ASIC inside one chip. And no. Look how patents work not what some magazine wrote. Also go and look how ASIC works. Go to primary sources. Then you will figure out it is just propaganda to push SegWit... I'm hoping you are intelligent enough to figure out this and I know that me just putting out all information out would make you ignoring what I'm saying since you were told how you should think it works.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:01:58
Link to bitfury statment from you... and suporting SegWit is not same as BIP148. And as I told you. To meke sure that BIP148 dosent fork off is close to imposible. I wouldn't care to even attempt it for this fanetics... let them blow themselfs up.

Sorry there is no orphan chain to show you so I have to use words of core devs. And cfields is saying forking block if they really figure it out there was no fork and client was only stuck...
And if we are talking about segnet and testnet we should be talking about testnet5... You are impossible...
And I can fork a segnet right now with an old version of SegWit if that is needed to prove a point. It will fork on block 22130 or 22132... It will prove same thing this proves...
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:58:54

But yes I see you don't get it... If you don't have 33% of the hashrate miners will be afraid...

There is no production code to do that at the moment AFAIK
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:04:20
I think mining on Slush setting BIP148 would be a better idea. If this pool is not PPS variance is just too big... with Slush you do share your mining till activation with the rest of a pool ~~si~~so there is smaller variance till activation... with this hashrate you will not get paid till activation or win a loto...
At least connect this pool to p2pool...

Well no. They had to make enough spem to get unstuck... And they are...
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:44:59
And no SegWit since it will timeout. You need 18% to activate it or it will time out..
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:15:51
Not it is a soft fork that looks like a hard fork unless it gets enough hashing power.
BIP148 would only include all SegWit blocks to first noneSegWit block. After that chain forks and it will not accept any SegWit block off a nonBIP148 chain.
Also there is a big chance that BIP148 would fail to active SegWit. It needs 18% of hashing power to activate or it will time out...
If it gets about 33% of hashing power it will be close to immune to attacks and 51% would mean it will probably reorg noneBIP148 chain unless it adds reorg protection...
EDIT: But you did get a part of nodes taking them self of a chain right...

@_date: 2017-06-06 23:35:32
Might... But there is much more at stake at that point... A lot of 12,5BTC in a legacy chain... And making sure that is stays longer then BIP148 chain... Also making sure that BIP148 chain fails is a good motivation... Miners have hi profits right now so they can afford to do that and even crash BTC price and then rebuy at the bottom...

Not really. Since it is SHA256(that none will use same as Namecoin) or merged mining...
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:03:16
At 1 block per day miners need to wait 100 days to get paid... and the price would crash...
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:49:55
That is why I'm saying that anyone who is BSing about Bitmain at the moment have no idea how ASIC works or is dishonest. ASIC can do only one thing. And it can do normal SHA256 or ASICBOOST SHA256. So if it works with any pool there is no ASICBOOST... As far as I know you wold need new protocol to replace stratum...
ASICBOOST is not a attack vector but optimisation... Same as CPU -&gt; GPU -&gt; ASIC... And can be disabled in many ways...
So think what we were told about ASICBOOST. Somehow Greg reversed engenired 14nm chip that would take probably years, millions of dollars and a big team. We were told that Bitmain that was blocking SegWit is using it. And that only solution is SegWit... If that is not a load of BS I don't know what is...
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:56:25
First of all. BIP148 might have about 25% support at best... Than a HF POW... I don't think so... Unless you get some real economy you will probably die much sooner then you think...
EDIT: Also GPUs still need cheap power... And ASIC are not monopoly... Avalon, Bitfury and Bitmain... But Bitmain has the best price of them all yes... And a normal person can only buy with Avalon and Bitmain... To buy from Bitfury you need a lot of $$$ since you need to buy a lot... For GPU you have only 2... And AMD is out of stock and nVidea has only hi end GPU in stock...

2016 blocks in 2 weeks with 100%
2016 blocks in 200 weeks(~~4years) with about 1%
Just in case you triple you hashing rate
Even with 5% that would be close to a year... No miner would jump on board with that... Risk of abandonment is just too big...
And reorg attack that can take everything away from miners is also a real danger... Enough to move every economical miner off that chain. Only politically motivated would stay. But I guess that is at best what you have now 0.3%
ETH and ETC worked since it is retargeting difficulty every block...
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:34:54
bi-directional payment channels are not one of them... And they talk only about malleability to be a problem so no...
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:55:23
Yes but at current timeline and code it will not happen soon enough... And they are also talking in adding some changes that will probably not work with current SegWit... So not sure if they will add bit 1...
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:37:45
Good luck with your altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:44:14
Testnet has SegWit and it doesn't work there either... Well it kind of works but it is far from finished... And I'm sure we will have SegWit2MB long before LN...
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:32:17




Yes as I told you there is a way to move more then that. It has already more blocks and if miners coridnate they can get it back...


You don't get game theory... There are blocks in it where miners have got a lot of coins... It is far from over if they kill BIP148 chain...


Again not if it is coordinated attack... And without seeing increase on BIP148 chain it more of an attack. Even variance would make people nerves...


There was no reason given to miners to make the attack. In this case there is. Also do you know how difficulty work in ETH and BTC... Look into it...
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:11:01
You do know how difficulty works in Bitcoin right? First difficulty adjustment would happen in abut 1,5 years with 1%... And for this to work you would need to adjust difficulty to 1%... And if I remember right max difficulty change is 25% if it goes down... Now go and look at ETC difficulty adjustment and see why that worked for ETC
EDIT: But I do start to see a trend in BIP148 supporters... 
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:11:06
What is a minimum to get SegWit activated? About 15% right?
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:57:25
Reorg attack... You mine 10 empty blocks and reorg 9 UASF blocks... But I'm sure there are more innovative ways... 
EDIT: But I was not talking about attacks but just a split... SW will not split a chain if miners are enforcing it but will if users are enforcing it...
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:56:23
Do you know how ASIC works? I'm asking since it looks like you don't if you think you can implement ASICBOOST on a miner that can mine on any pool. This is real BS. Unless Butmain have 2 chips and he is selling only one there is no ASICBOOST...
And even if this was not the case why would they do this and be ready to kill all ASICBOOST not just covert: 




EDIT: spelling
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:19:43
No... 25 is not enough... Even 33 is not enough especially if there is a big enough lead... And you should not assume capitulation...
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:48:57
Or drop... Current hashrate means miners will get paid in more then 100 days... 5% would be about 2 weeks...
To use coinbase reword you need to wait 100 blocks...
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:23:08
I'm not. UASF is also a client on official page... Same as XT was/is... EDIT: there is also a lot of run UASF client...
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:12:31
Miners? Bitfury is 4% and Slush is 4% but only 6% of that 4% will got to BIP148... So less then 5%... To activate SegWit before timeout you need 18%... If you don't get 18% that makes BIP148 pointless...
EDIT: Was it sarkazem?

Did you?




I rest my point...
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:01:07
Yes you are right it is line 22. But as far as I know this is not hardcoded and can be changed as miners always did in config file...
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:19:48
There is a 100BTC+ fee transaction out there that can be used since it is bigger then 1MB... So it is not a problem...
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:49:34
after one BIP148 reorg... they will all know...
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:22:48
24 hours can easy be variance...
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:50:52
BIP148 will fail to activate SegWit if it has less then 15 to 18% of hashrate since SegWit it will time out. 83% signed SegWit2MB. I Don't think it is going to heppen... Even if BIP148 chain dosen't die it will not have SegWit...
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:24:32
Not with 1 block per day...
