So... IOTA?

I have been able to deposit, anyway. They still haven't given me a hash for the transfer to binance.

Has anyone been able to transfer out of GDAX to Binance, yet?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:59:37
GDAX pushed an update at the top of their site. Then my transfer went through.

Not yet for ETH. Coinbase to Gdax.

It's solely a coinbase/gdax issue. I'm trying to move ETH from coinbase to GDAX. Same error.

they just pushed an update. then it worked!

You can try. It's more expensive.

You can try. It's more expensive, if it works...

It would be ironic if the posts were made by the same person. This is just...well, kind of the opposite of irony. It's exactly what I would expect. The prevalence of the second type of post is the whole reason the first post was made.

I'm not interested in your asinine wallet example. 
When I buy a share of Netflix, IDGAF about the real estate they own, and neither do the black boxes that are trading Netflix all day long. Truth.

The important part.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:13:35
I know how it works.
You said yourself that companies basically only liquidate when things have gone to shit. At that point, shareholders get squat.
So, everyone really is deriving their value from selling to someone else and not being left holding the bag. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:32:38


No. No they aren't. You might want them to be thinking that way, but they aren't.
Asset-based valuations are only useful in a very narrow range. 
Here is Netflix's Balance Sheet: 
Use these numbers and the shares outstanding (432.73 Million) to get to the current stock price. You can't. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:20:43


This is an extremely naive way to value a company. It only makes sense to consider an asset-based approach in a narrow set of circumstances. It certainly doesn't make sense to use it in the Netflix example you give later. 
When would a shareholder expect to get paid out in your scenario? If it's any time before the company goes out of business, then we're back to the greater fool, right? If it is when the company stops operations, where do you think shareholders stand in line when liquidation occurs? No way shareholders get anything close to what they were expecting.
Dividends aren't the end all be all of stock valuation, but they're a better base (along with earnings) than straight asset value.
