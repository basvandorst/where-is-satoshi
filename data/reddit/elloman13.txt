I've been buying BTC without ID at a good conversion rate though until 4 hours ago when the website started acting up
EDIT: Ok reason the website was 'acting up' was because i was trying to buy a small amount of BTC this time "Smaller amounts of coins tend to cost more than larger amounts, as the overheads for the brokers are high for a small fee. It's also the weekend so there are fewer brokers around and less competition for trades. We don't directly set prices, the brokers do that in the end, so we can't force them to set any given price so it's a case of either purchasing a larger amount to get a better rate, or waiting for more sellers to be online."

I know I don't need verification for bittylicious, it's the website I've been using but recently as soon as I try to make a purchase it shows me a ridiculous conversion rate which is different from the conversion rate displayed before I click buy. I don't know what the fuck is going on. I made another thread about this.

I'll leave thread up incase someone comes across it with the same question

Ok I get it but there must be websites which sell with out ID verification, I know bitttylicious is one but the website is acting up for me at the moment for some reason
