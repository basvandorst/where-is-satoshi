Definitely! Thanks again serp (:

I wouldn't expect that rate consistently.

As announced in the Bitcointalk thread, we now accept payment via Bitpay.

Unfortunately, there isn't a website at the moment but I've been mainly operating via the DevScrow Bitcointalk thread here, 
You can check out my Bitcointalk trust here,

Great article! Glad I could contribute (:

That's gonna be a pretty awesome documentary if these people actually know what they're talking about. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 00:13:28
Wow, nice GIF!

It's essentially just the private key encrypted with a passphrase.

I recommend you store your savings offline with something like the Armory wallet. Or you can even use the standard bitcoin-qt client and encrypt your wallet. To answer your question though, you can transfer your bitcoin wallet to a new computer.

I'm not into American football too much, but it has been ;)

It supports the Bitcoin system and therefore encourages other companies to come on board providing services or selling goods with Bitcoin, along FIAT currencies. Ultimately bringing up the price even more in the long run.

Wow, that's a really beautiful infographic. Dang.

I appreciate the input.
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:30:17
Ha, thanks for the tip!

Hi, click the link to the product page to see how the ordering works. You're not charged unless at least 20 shirts are sold. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 12:49:32
Shoot me a message, I'll see what we can work out.
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:18:50
Over .15BTC was tipped, thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-08-09 22:39:14
Which wallet are you using?
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:05:03
Pretty interesting concept, I wouldn't mind moving there. You gotta love those retarded comments on the article though...
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:56:54
It's a little far away from Florida. We need another conference in Miami (:

I'm working on finding a screen printer that accepts Bitcoin. I'm also underage working as a freelancer so that makes things slightly more difficult. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:33:22
It should be! The address starting with 12zdgV is the donation address.
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:36:48
Keeping notes in case of the site going down would involve backing up the DB on Github as well, daily backups or what not would work. It's definitely something we'll explore in the future!
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:25:21
You're welcome! We're looking forward to serving you.
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:28:19
We'll be working on getting this as secure as possible. Keep an eye out for patches and updates!
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:05:44
We migrated servers yesterday, so either your cell provider or your ISP may not have propagated. I'll take a look though!

Our SSL Cert has been configured.

Very neat

Google Analytics as well as Adsense have been removed. I have replaced AdSense with a self hosted Piwik platform. Also, if you have Do Not Track enabled this will be honored and visits will not be tracked. No service will be replacing Adsense as I feel Passphrase.io should be solely donation supported. Source code will not be released for the time being, but it may be in the future. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:34:56
That shouldn't be the case anymore, let me know if you still receive the same warning.
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:23:55
We'll be brainstorming ways to make it decentralized in the future.
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:38:24
Everything here has been noted! Stay tuned for updates.
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:23:19
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:34:16
Thank you for your input, this may come in the future!
@_date: 2015-07-24 18:59:13
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:43:19
Boom! Thank you 
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:21:48
Give it a shot! (;
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:01:26
I appreciate the input! 
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:12:26
This may come in the future. Enjoy!
@_date: 2015-07-08 04:37:54
Thanks for the catch, fixed.
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:21:09
We're glad you're enjoying it!

Thank you.

SSL has been enabled!
~~HTTPS will be enabled within the next week or so.~~
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:53:03
We're brainstorming ways to do do this without sacrificing security.
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:33:31
Yes, that'd be sweet! You're more than welcome to make one. Please share the link here if you do.
