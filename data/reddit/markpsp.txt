Hopefully you are sending it to an exchange to trade for BCH. You don't have to worry about conformations and fees when using BCH.

How soon before we see 60% users leave btc? Once btc loses a certain amount of cryptocurrency users, it'll start to look like an alt coin and will only speed the downtrend even faster..
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:21:47
If Coinbase is the single point of failure for btc, I think btc is very weak and is not great at all. How can an exchange be a single point of failure for a global currency? 
In any case literally all other alts are better off since they don't actually put their faith and hopes into a single exchange and make it their single point of failure. Maybe btc should be an alt and let a better coin take over instead. You can't be claiming yourself as the best when everything you have is dependent and relies on an exchange. It's like centralizing all you failures into a single place lol..

If it's open source, does it mean I can take the source code, modify it, improve it and use it freely?

They do not:

Litecoin is litecoin. They are different block chain and different developers. Point out to me where it says that are officially a team. An alt is an alt, unless you can't proof they aren't an alt. Might as well say use Bitcoin Cash since it's faster and cheaper than litecoin. Why choose litecoin since everybody knows average fee on bitcoin cash is only half a cent and is cheaper than litecoin? What's the basis to pick litecoin when there are other more superior coins available? Even the founder  of litecoin Charlie sold off his coins at the peak and gave lame excuses as if we don't know he has no confidence in the price long term. I don't see any developers of Bitcoin core doing the same to sell off all their btc to remain "impartial". Litecoin is just a shitty alt and the founder bailed out. Stop promoting alts here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:37:44
So it's totally fine to make bitcoin cash with improved speed and cheaper fees. Got it, buy BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:56:34
Oh you referring to btc with only 1 centralized team of developer that came up with failed solutions, causing slow and expensive transactions? Nah.. I prefer to stick to a coin with 8 teams of developer and runs on consensus from every party involve who do not censor everyone who disagree with them ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:45:03
Where can I buy mempool futures? To the Moon!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:15:31
You can read more at  there are 5 teams of developers ;) get your facts right.
I think you refer to bitcoin core, transaction fees alone is already 30usd, so of course you can't even afford miner fees to withdraw ;)
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:55:42
Ripple is not mineable and has no proof of work. It's not encrypted unless proven otherwise. A centralized coin made and controlled by a company called Ripple Labs. Yup, this sounds like a very stable and reliable "crypto" currency. Remind me again how is ripple encrypted without POW done?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:59:02
Not sure why you being bcash into this, they're not even a cryptocurrency.
As for value, what's the difference if you deposit gold at the nodes? It's much stable and you can physically hang on to it. If you want secure, there are so many miners out there mining crypto, many of them are also secure and decentralized. But why is core only centralized under blockstream? Can we Decentralize it by having other developer teams code and improve as well and spread out the risk? Or the decentralize is only used when convenient but only blockstream and blockstream alone can determine the development of btc?
I haven't have any good reply on dev so far.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:42:42
You talk like $15 is a very normal fee to pay. Literally every other coin out there transacts for less than 1 dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:21:25
Yup, 8 different teams to Decentralize the development and future changes are based on consensus.
Core is only determined by blockstream, you will never hear any other developer having consensus. Plus, they are making a second chain to help Bitcoin, like giving it crutches to walk causes it's too slow and expensive to use.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:28:29
Why are you sending such a small amount? Are you spamming the network?
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:17:03
It's their fault for wanting to transact cheaply? What is Bitcoin? Some kind of corporate banker that forces customers to pay through their nose to transact?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:05:00
Stop shilling alts here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:47:27
So how you solve the high tx and fees problem? Cause people get burn there. Money is always the main reason for value and if people are losing money, there isn't much value, it? For the majority, you either solve it or get out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:00
Oh, if competition is good, then btc should compete with bch. Let them fight it out and compete to see who's there real bitcoin.
Edit; Let me screenshot this.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:52:02
Yup, you're right. Leaving block size at 1mb so the rest of us pays USD 40 for tx fees during peak period is cheap and easy. Could just leave the 1mb there for years and it won't cost anything to destroy it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:06:09
LTC is an alt. Stop promoting alts in /Bitcoin.
Layer 2 is exactly like a debit card. We topup our layer 2 (lightning) and then spend, and when we run out off credit, we top up our lightning again. Yes, our scaling is better than a bank. Can't wait for lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:52:18
Gemini will probably start trading bch soon. Like futures, when a rival opens up a new channel, competitors have to keep up or else lose market share. Any exchange is the same, with BCH transactions increasing, exchanges want a share of the profit for economic reasons. You can go ahead and pay 30usd tx fees, but Gemini will just list bch in a couple of weeks time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:14
What are you even rambling about. The whole system is based on public-private key. Of course Bch keys can be used in btc. That's why Bch don't need slow expensive Tokens from btc lagwit chain.
Gold don't need to be sent, just like how btc dont need to be sent through lightning. You just need to open channel and send IOU tabs.
Blockstream dictates all the decision that causes this mess. No major Miners are supporting segwit, how do you propose lightning to work without segwit? Force Miners to fork?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:40:32
Gemini doesn't support segwit and has trading for BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:50:03
What's the point of btc if you don't need it? Might as well deposit fiat cash into lightning nodes and open channels, then close channels and remove your cash, isn't Bitcoin core redundant according to your logic?
Or you could deposit gold to the lightning nodes and once your done, your can withdraw gold. It fulfills exactly what you described since gold is also a store of value.
Care to clarify? I'm curious.
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:00:07
So big blocks is ok? Means bitcoin cash was right on big blocks all along?
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:03:25
How do you proof this scam?
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:31:57
How so? Care to share the "innovation" you just mentioned? As far as I know 1mb blocks is the max you'll ever get. You cannot hard fork because apparently you will be an alt.
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:06:06
 Uninstall windows now! Remove centralization! All btc supporters should uninstall windows and only support Decentralize btc merchants!
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:22:49
What if over of the nodes crashes before you can close the channel? Let's say power failure or hardware failure, is your money still there after 3 days to bring it back up?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:49:40
They are just another exchange like Coinbase. They will be adding BCH and LTC trading this year which will be great!
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:27:25
You talk about OB taking funding from "us", so could you at least share how much you funded them? How much did you buy? How much are they losing because you are boycotting them? Lol, I think they don't even notice any changes if you stop spending, after all, you don't spend, you hodl ;)
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:08:03
How do you overtake visa? Bitcoin got all backlog and jammed in November and December last year at 1mb blocks and some transactions were stuck in the mempool for a month. Care to explain how 1 month in the mempool will overtake visa?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:11:15
Does this also mean its centralization since the dust are all accumulated into fewer wallets?
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:37:55
Lol outdated? What improvements have btc done? When was the last permanent upgrade done?
Lightning isn't btc, lightning is going to be used by all other alts. So I haven't seen any update on btc. Segwit is an optional function that nobody uses, and but somehow trolls are angry at companies that don't use segwit. Isn't segwit an optional soft fork in the first place? The meaning of optional seem to have been lost to trolls of btc.
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:28:07
If I knowingly paid money and receive my burger as advertised from macdonaldss, it's not a scam. Maybe go back to elementary school and try to understand the word scam? Or buy a dictionary and read a little?
I willingly and knowingly buy bitcoin cash and they advertise 0-conf and fast transactions, which I find very true after performing transactions myself, so how is this a scam?
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:39:45
You do know lightning is already running and nobody wants to use it right? The btc pump barely lasted over an hour and it's down again.
Atomic swaps are already in existence on barterdex since last year but btc is still going down.
Ethernet can upgrade, but BTC cannot upgrade without hard fork. I'll keep mining the old BTC and make sure it remains alive. I'm sure Jihan will also mine the old BTC and keep it at 1mb, so any improvement and forks you have is an alt of BTC.. Just like how you call bitcoin cash an alt after they forked, ironic isn't it? What's you think bs cancelled s2x hard fork? Cause they know the new s2x will be an alt when we put hash power into BTC and refuse to hard fork. We want btc to forever remain slow and expensive 1mb so they cannot compete with bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:58:45
What's Rescan? I didn't know you can reverse transactions on bitcoin unless it's RBF.
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:57:53
Wait, it takes up to 3 minutes to reach the BTC mempool? Is this normal? I thought transactions immediately reaches the mempool the moment you scan. 
Does this mean transactions aren't immediate? I'm curious if you need to wait 3 minutes to reach mempool for bitpay to detect it during purchase. Can you explain further on how BTC works with bitpay? I'm genuinely curious..
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:16:46
How much did you spend on open bazaar? I thought btc is for hodling?
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:18:36
So in other words, LN is only for pros, hi-tech specialist and developers with in-depth knowledge to run. I mean how do you expect an ordinary average Joe to know if his backup is in sync or not? How do you expect the average normal person to know what is corrupted and what is not? How do you get more people to use it when they have no idea what happened and all they see is their money gets confiscated because they attempted to do "fraud"? 
Real good tech you have there. Good job catching a 60 year old Grandpa trying to "defraud" LN.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:03:21
Yup, exactly what I meant, centralizing all the dust of many wallets into fewer wallets. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:45:05
"..person consolidating the dust in their wallet into bigger lumps in that wallet."
Wooot??? Your wallet has the ability to lump different amounts into different compartments in the same wallet?
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:25:30
Yeah, bch took 6 months too reach 4 digits and now over 100k merchants using it. Not to mentioned SBI, Microsoft and many merchants accepting it upfront.
Lightning needs to be hosted online to work whereas BCH works onchain.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:29:34
Why would we want merchants? We should hodl, not giving it to mechants.
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:06:37
Well, this is the mentality of core. Destroying private property. Sure.
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:57:25
Lol, go ahead, call the owner of Bitcoin to sue me.. oh wait.. Bitcoin is open sourced?? So anybody can fork bitcoin like Linux flavors! Hahahaha nice job troll. Crying and spraying billboards on private property, that's the level of core shills ;) that's real mature, so nature of core users ��
Edit: Lol that core shill wuss deleted his post after got caught trying to incite people to destroy private property!!
