The Fed just recently "tapered" their stimulus. Could be that the dollar has gained value - including people selling BTC. Both means a big loss in value

What's up with these copy-cat crypto currencies?

As somewhat of an anarchist, I'm really surprised at this

Wish I could counterfeit money and charge interest for lending it. Its time we have integrity in our monetary system

Have you contacted Gox? I use coinbase, now I'm scared my 3BTC will vanish.

Buyers vs. Sellers

This is great. Especially since I started boycotting DirecTV over the AT&amp;T takeover

This is a realistic forcast for the BTC, as with any other commodity/currency. The bubble WILL pop eventually. Its just a matter of when and how much.

So I read the article but I'm still confused how BTC and CNY are related here. Are Chinese banks buying BTC?
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:06:54
Where's the best place to find BTC's most recent price in USD?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:11:41
If everyone panic sells their Bitcoins

Hold on to them, it will come back

We don't really know how overpriced or underpriced it really is. Bitcoin has recently become popular. Who knows where it's price may go, but it only relative to the dollar, and the dollar's value is guaranteed to decline substantially in the near future. That's why people buy precious metals that keep their value, while your dollars in the bank are losing their value as we speak.

The trend is your friend
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:43:34
I think it def applies to stocks but idk about currencies/commodities 
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:58:22
Bitcoin is still relatively new. It will take some time for it to became truly accepted and used. When the the government debt bubble bursts, and the dollar bubbles subsequently bursts, bitcoin will likely take the lead.

I bought some yesterday on Coinbase. The transaction should be complete on the 12th it said, so roughly five days.

Bitcoins are like any commodity. Their price is influenced by supply and demand. Thankfully, Bitcoins are protected from inflation, since there can only be so many (21 million) right now there are roughly 11 million but their supply will increase steadily. If people decide to sell their Bitcoins for dollars (more supply less demand) their price will decrease.

In r/Economics a while ago, I started hearing more about BTC and thought I'd check it out. Wish I heard of it sooner!
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:14:55
Fuck Uncle Sam &gt;:(
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:26:02
Should we expect a price spike after the hearing today?
