Ahoy, I like seeing the happiness when there's good news and the defence of the technology when others say it is doomed :)

1. I haven't heard of you.
2. Website good, maybe will need to simplify journey for regular users, also maybe the general public would think bit quick = bit expensive. 
3. Your footer should be updated to 2015. There's no help text or error messages in your Buy Bitcoins journey, rookies will need this.

You can see this on bemorebitcoin.com/ifibought, think it's only UK though.

Seasons greetings :)

I think those are pending transactions you are looking at, so the increase in January was when there were more transactions than could be added. Time frame I was looking at was this year during price decline.
