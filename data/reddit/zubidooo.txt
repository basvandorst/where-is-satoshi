Great initiative. I understand you do local orders only. For those interested in ordering home and office furniture online (free shipping nationwide), we accept bitcoins. Our site is

Just updated the site

- my bitcoin limit is $1000 usd. If you order more than 1k usd in bitcoins, contact me first to set up your order. 
(already had a few declined orders because the order size was too large to process in bitcoins)

hey thanks man! here's the dimensions:

Polished stainless steel base

I have the tulip table which might interest you - it's a very large and heavy table with a marble top and a fiberglass base.

lol that's quite an assumption. Have you ever bought anything from us? 
We inspect the furniture before it leaves the factory and a second time before it leaves the warehouse. So far none of our customers have ever complained about the quality of our products.
Our products are virtually indistinguishable from the originals at 20% of the cost, so for anyone who's looking for a cost effective way to redesign their home or office with beautiful furniture, we're the best solution.
We focus on the mid-tier range of the market, so although we don't sell high-end furniture, we're definitely not cheap either. But if you have the funds to splurge on an authentic 5k chair or a 10k sofa, then by all means go ahead. :)

good call mate, I definitely should have the dimensions on the site. And my mistake, the correct dimensions for the LC10 square coffee table is: 
Length: 47" x Width: 47" x Height: 14"
I've also uploaded a picture of how it would look like in a living room.

yeah def.
The plan is to support the bitcoin community and to keep it growing through its usage. Customers have the option to pay in bitcoin at the final page of the checkout process. I'll place a bitcoin accepted gif in the footer sometime tomorrow.
