The most cost efficient way to buy BTC is by meeting someone in person and do the BTC exchange for cash this way. You only pay the normal Blockchain fee and nothing on top off that you even can set a lower fee than an exchange would estimate in most cases...

Try searching for people to trade in person with you only pay the lowest chain fee and it‘s pretty easy.

Most exchanges are required by law to confirm you identity. However you shouldn‘t be handing it out if you don‘t feel well about this exchange.

Banks have their own Crypto Currency called Ripple and are allready trading with Bitcoin too they just adapt it does not pose a big threat to their business model as long as you are required to pay your taxes in Federal Currency...

It requires you to hold on to federal currency since you need to pay with it that is what gives the value people using it just like with bitcoin and all other currencys

Since the Blockchain is public and normal wallest would change up their addresses from time to time you can tell if something has not been used or looked at for some time you then guess which of these coins are dormant by comparing their time frames.

Sell BTC for your countrys currency on an online exchange or trade for cash with someone in person, after that add that money to your paypal balance if you wish

Bitcoin.de lets you setup a free linked german bank acc with them within less than 1 hour and gives you the ability to instantly trade your btc on the market (in 2000€ packs for the beginning but no limit to packs)  fee is 0,5%/trade it just takes the usual confirmation time to send your coins in and after your trade you have to make a normal free Sepa transfer to your main bank.

You could open a german bank acc with Bitcoin.de and Fidor Bank every btc you sell is instantly in your fidor bank acc and can be sent via wire transfer. However you might encounter difficulties opening an account in europe since you are from russia if I understood correctly...

Bitcoin.org may help.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:55:32
Bitcoins database is public you need to make it annonymous yourself...

Find somebody to trade in person with. You will only be able to trade big amounts eg. if price skyrocketing again if u are above 18 years of age for legal reasons. 
Edit: You could ask your Parents to buy some for you as your trustees until you turn 18.
