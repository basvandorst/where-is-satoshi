1) This is a bill, not a law
2) I don't live in the US, so it doesn't apply to me
3) That's not even what the bill say, Mr. Amateur Lawyer.
4) Shut up. You have no idea what the fuck you are talking about.

Hey I asked nicely
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:38:07
1000000% agree with you. It just gets tediosu to read it all over again. Like there was a guy who pissed me off: he posted, "herp derp even if you had bought bitcoin at $20 you would have sold at $100 ROFLLL!!!!"
This pisses me off to no end.

Reddit idiot uses FEAR-MONGERING
It's very ineffective.

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:33:23
Ah yes, entirely moving your entire life and everything you've fucking built in 40+ years. A trivial task indeed!
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:34:42
I 100% agree with you.
Just saying.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:57:19
Fuck Newspapers.
Fuck the Dutch.
And, most importantly, fuck the government. Professional crooks and tyrants.

@_date: 2017-12-08 08:37:39
Yeah, that's not going to happen bro. LOL.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:52:51
Uhh, no thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:15:54


And much safer too. You are an idiot if you think police is there to protect you. Wake that guy who got shot by the SWAT and tell me you feel safe, pawn.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:33:46


Well, pretty much me too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:37:34

@_date: 2017-12-08 08:40:48
You are correct.
And you just know that money goes to pay some moron who sits in his office all day and earns $100,000+ per year
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:56:50
Ah, no argument at all. Enjoy sucking the government's dick. I've heard a senator needs a new Lamborghini, guess you'll be contributing LOL
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:38:21
Yeah that's not going to happen dude.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:36:30
This is too complicated and a waste of the very little time we have to live. Fuck that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:58:43
Giving up already? OK!
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:27:19
... yet
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:05:08
Just make sure you store them correctly. Nano Ledger S or nothing, period.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:42:18
^ This, a million times
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:57:49
Enjoy wasting 30% of  your bitcoins, moron.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:32:38
LOL probably yes!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:07:49
You are a fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:39:50
Fuck Teachers - just basically power tripping assholes who like to oppress kids.
Fuck policemen - agents of oppression. Dont give a fuck about you and your rights.
Fuck firefighters. Fucking nazis tried to access my house to "check my fire alarm" Fucking invasion of privacy.
Infrastructure - I pay my municipal taxes, TVYM
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:59
... they are going to take  30% of your BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:04:15
Do you enjoy being a stupid useless little pawn? You are no better than a slave.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:09:46
Do you know what "taxed on your income" means?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:03:34
So do I, Simon.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:41:51
Yeah you're a paranoid little fuck you know that? Probably spend your life being afraid of everything, even your own shadow. Fucking moron.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:38:39
The thing is, bitcoin litterally CANNOT be a ponzi scheme. A ponzi scheme happens when you take guy B's money to give it to guy A, guy C to guy B, etc. This has nothing to do with bitcoins at all.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:40:34
HAHA PEOPLE GET RAPED IN JAIL!! SO FUNNY GUYS!!!! WE MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE IN MIDDLE AGE FOR BEING BARBARIC BUTTTTTT WHEN IT HAPPENS TODAY ITS OK!!!!

My god you are a paranoid fuck. Sanders paid 17% in taxes after spending years criticizing those who avoided taxes and no one gave a shit, but OFC you're telling US to pay. Fucking communist scum.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:38:59
Yes, pay someone $200+ per hour so you can lose 30% of your bitcoins. BRILLIANT idea! Why haven't you won a Nobel prize yet?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:21:53
The makers might have put a weakness in place and grab your private address whenever hey want
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:32:29
Actually you are wrong, I know someone who got an antminer from them. Its not that hard, lol.
As for the room, I'll use the cooler trick. ROI will be around $20 per day I calculated (assuming nnormal hash increase in difficulty by the time I get it).
Also S9 is $1460, not 3k lolz.
Anyway thanks for the response I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:29:48
Because the pussies on this pussy subreddit think you should pay taxes on your bitcoins or something... LOL

You have to be the copyright owner or a representative to DMCA dude........ I fail to see what copyright bitcoin.com infringes. You apparently don'T know what a copyright is LOL.

Don't bother with ETH, it's about to become a stupid developer EGO contest. BTC and maybe LTC is where its at.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:01:19
Can we stop that BS please? We all know bitcoin isn't dead or dying. The smart people (including me) are buying bitcoins now. Just stop with that annohing shit please
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:37:41
1) Melt the coin
2) Sell gold as bullion
Problem solved.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:19:33
It sucks, but I actually agree with you. Damn.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:22:52
what if theres a weakness and they steal from my nano
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:37:02
Yeah but the domain most likely belong to another comapny that belongs to another company that belongs to another... It would cost millions to MAYBE be able to seize it, and then what? It would be sold at auction and MAYBE pay the lawers fee if you are lucky.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:40:21


Congrats, you discovered capitalism! My restaurant buys doughtnuts for $0.50 each and sells them $1.50. 


@_date: 2017-11-28 21:46:09
Yeah until the developers to do another fork, then another, then another, then another then another. And then what? With ETH you are 100% at their mercy
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:56:10
what if the nano sends a copy of your private key when you boot the device? And they can steal ur bitcoins at any time?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:07:10

Look, it's available here:
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:32:29
I store them on a nano ledger and never share it/its info with anybody.
I am worried about someone bruteforcing my private key, that's it. I read that some people here have many of those + some HD and even paper wallet, so I was wondering if it was a decent idea to split my bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:55:35
Thx!
