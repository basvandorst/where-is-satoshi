And this has to do with bitcoin how?
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:21:45
So why did you change the part of it being an American invention?

This is actually hilarious. How did you manage to lose money on some of these coins? Do you ONLY buy at the peak? 




How is this even possible

The sheep marketplace scammers would not risk selling their bitcoins through an established exchange such as MTGOX so soon after their heist. This would allow individuals to track their bitcoins to MTGOX addresses and possibly lead to their identities being compromised if MTGOX admins look into it.

The title is misleading, the new AM1 "Full share" is still a pass through, although it represents 1 share of ASICminer rather than 1/100th.

What does this have to do with bitcoin?

TAT-Asicminer paid out dividends twice on BTCT, I wonder what happens now?

That 2.17% number should increase per day if more computational power is added to the system, right?

Did you even watch the video? Hes talking about the stock market not bitcoins.

You have to call them, sending reports via text on internet never does anything.

k so we should go back to pre-china prices aka $300 going by your logic

I doubt any big investor thinks bitcoin is a hard asset.

Predictious.com has a variety of offerings including btc/usd options. Volume is an issue though, as it is a relatively new site. Some other user stated something about prediction markets likely to go under, but I do not see how this could be realistic given that the markets operate on the fees and its users making bets against other users for the actual profit/loss "gambling" side.

I'm sure this piece of circlejerk blogspam will be upvoted by the religious.

How come in [this post]( you say that you invested 125 bitcoins in 2010?

The shares don't expire.
Also I definitely agree that with increasing difficulties there is a risk that you will not get 100% return based on dividends alone, that is why I am asking for opinions on what the price of 1 MH/s should actually be worth.
Keep in mind though that because its a stock you can easily sell your holdings, basically a "return policy." This allows you "mine" for about a week or so and then if you want, you can put your shares up for sale to break even on the cost of purchase + pocket the dividends.

A few years back, the only reason people had bitcoins was to buy and sell drugs. Fast forward to 2013, the only people reason had bitcoins was to buy/sell drugs and to speculate. Basically, BTC failed to gain any actual traction even with all the new attention, and the speculators are pulling out. 
I actually thought about pulling out earlier at around 90ish but I thought that maybe the news from the winklevoss twins would have some positive effect on BTC/USD, however after a few days it has become obvious that this is not the case. Luckily I got out earlier today at 85. I wouldn't be surprised to see BTC drop to pre media exposure levels in a couple months.

Great idea, but no way I am using this because of the following clause:
5.1.4 Pixode may require evidence of your identity before processing a withdrawal request. If Pixode requires evidence of your identity and it is not received within a reasonable time Pixode may suspend your account until such proof is received. No withdrawal will be processed until receipt of requested information.

224 day breakeven based on 61% profitability decline over one year, This is significantly shorter than ASICminer's multi year breakeven period based on dividends.
However, TAT.VIRTUALMINE will probably decline in share value while ASICminer will stay stagnant/rise.
I guess the choice to go in or not depends on one's individual risk acceptance profile.

is TAT's official statement, is it possible he will get the money back from our accounts?
