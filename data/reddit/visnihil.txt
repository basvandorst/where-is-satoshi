They batch transactions, so your BTC gets sent out along with other users'. They'd have a hard time justifying charging you the network fee, unless they decided to divide it between the users in question relative to your contribution to the TX size somehow.

You can buy BTC instantly on Coinbase with a credit or debit card. The fees are higher but you don't have to wait.

Both of those organizations aren't decentralized PROTOCOLS. 
No one owns the Bitcoin name. Firefox and Chromium are definitely owned.

The government shouldn't be in the business of holding speculative assets. They're doing the right thing.

The BCH people get accused of trying to "trick" others all of the time, but they're extremely enthusiastic about explain the differences between BCH and BTC. That's not a very practical strategy if the intent is to decieve.

Right now, the customer pays the fees. Batching would make that harder to justify.

Yeah, but Nokia is a brand. Bitcoin is supposed to be an open-source protocol without a centralized authority. No one has any more of a claim to the handle than the person who owns it now.

Do you have a link to where that was published 4 days ago? Or maybe a screencap with a date?

Tor was created by the US Navy. They have  one desire to kill it.

I think benefiting financially from the operation of the satellite would make you legally responsible for its operation. The nature of bitcoin makes it a little less clear than a normal financial arrangement, but if it went to court, I think the judgement would be against the new "owner" of the wallet.

Then who does the money you pay to rent it go to?

Coinbase actually does insure BTC and USD held in their exchange. They're FDIC insured for USD and have private insurance for their BTC. However, this only applies to hacks targeting Coinbase itself. If your account is compromised individually, you're not covered.

I don't agree that a modern cell phone, which is essentially a pocket-sized supercomputer with a huge range of functions can be put into the same category as the room-sized analog computers of the past. The microprocessor itself was a huge leap, but it was invented right on the gold/non-gold standard boundry date.
It's just a matter of semantics though. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:41:47
Like the cell phone, the internet, GPS, etc?

Ask Roger. I'm not the one selling it. Just pointing out that OP's claim isn't true. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:07:45
Yeah, I'm not supporting the naming convention used on the site. Just pointing out that OP is just wrong. Making easily disproven claims doesn't achieve anything positive. It makes it easy to dismiss other criticism that may actually have merit. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:47:10
That's not an option on the site. Everyone is posting that same screencap, but I guess no one actually bothered to check the site. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:17:31
But if you had bothered actually checking the site, you'd realize that that isn't the case.
There's no option to buy Bitcoin Cash on the *buy.bitcoin.com* page.
That guide page may say that, but it isn't the case. It takes two seconds to check, but everyone would rather just pointlessly argue.
Again, there are a plenty of legitimate complaints to have, but this isn't one of them, and OP encouraging people to lie is just shitty.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:03:34
Except it doesn't do that at all. It sells Bitcoin as "Bitcoin Core". It doesn't sell BCH at all, as far as I can tell, and it definitely doesn't sell it on the page OP is talking about. You can disagree with calling it Bitcoin Core, but that's a far different complaint. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:48:32
I did. Did you? It's the same on desktop. I'm betting you just went off that screenshot that's making the rounds and didn't actually check. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:41:28
No, it doesn't. The page OP is talking about is just selling Bitcoin, labeled as "Bitcoin Core". I poked around but couldn't find a place to buy BCH directly from the site. All I found was a list of exchanges and the buy page, selling Bitcoin. 
[Here's]( a screenshot if you don't want to visit the site. I even tried clicking on the "BTC" to see if it would let me select BCH but it didn't. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:34:30
I couldn't find an option to buy it directly in my 5 min of searching, but either way, it doesn't sell it on the page OP is talking about. It's got a page that lists exchanges, but no option to buy BCH direct with a credit card on the site. Just a page to buy Bitcoin, sold as "Bitcoin Core". 
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:41:40
Especially since their "buy with credit card" option gives you Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash. I'm assuming the OP doesn't realize that though, since he's trying to avoid visiting the site.
Edit: [Here's]( a screenshot, if you don't want to visit the site.

It's not "more than over a previous period" it's just "more". Literally any more.
Use rate could plummet but this metric would still go up if there was more than 0 activity. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 19:27:22
This looks interesting.
Hope I'm not too late.
