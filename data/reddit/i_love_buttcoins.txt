An article from 2011 prior to all of the intelligence leaks hardly does anything to ease my mind.

You're right. It's totally normal and not at all something odd to find on your phone and have questions about.

I'm not a terrorist.

Nope. I disconnected from Wifi. I am connecting using 4G when I get these results.
Unless you're suggesting I use the DoD as a router, I don't understand what you mean.

So my phone is configured to an IP address belonging to DOD but administered by Sprint, who is then immediately routing that traffic internally somewhere else and then out from the server with the IP address I see from Ipmonkey.com?

I agree, but I'm genuinely confused as to why my phone is routing ALL of my outgoing traffic to DoD Network Information Center AND THEN routing that traffic out to the web.

The problem with that article is that I get DIFFERENT results depending on where I am checking my IP from.
The IP on the phone is the one that resolves to DoD. This corresponds to ALL of my outgoing traffic.
When I check my IP address from an online service (ipmonkey.com) I get an IP address registered to sprint.
This means that everything on my phone is making a stop at DoD before being directed to where it should have been going in the first place.
The article doesn't ease my mind. Rather it suggests that as a blanket, all Sprint users should just brush this to the side and forget about it because that's the way it is.

I accept the explanation, but at the time of making this post, I had not the slightest idea what was going on.

Hmm.. That sounds fishy as all hell.

lol, I had a similar experience with a moped shop here in town.
They wanted help setting up some computer nonsense, and I told them I would help them out if instead of paying me in money, they just let me set them up to accept bitcoins as payment.
They got bitchy about it so I was just like "Fuck it." and went to  explained bitcoins to them, and two days later they were accepting bitcoins.
Now I can get all my shiny new moped parts in bitcoin. :)

Looks like it's happening to me.

No Wifi. Just 4g
