There is no such thing as a free market. Because if you have a "free market" then, the first person to be successful in it (Mt. Gox)  is "free" to rig the "market" to make them more money, and nothing can stop them, since its a "free market". So, its an oxymoron. "Free Markets" can never actually exist.

The vast majority of the public doesn't know a thing about bitcoins.  They'd probably think it was some account number. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 01:33:48
Because drug laws are illegal.

Implying you shouldn't hit/kill a woman, just because she's female, is sexist. 
If you want equality, that means all of it, good and bad.

How the fuck do you figure.  No one will ever want to use them now,  and they'll probably be getting sued by numerous rich and powerful people.

Because its more likely the person knew what the proper use of the word was, and just typed the wrong one. Which makes you a douche. 
Since this is the internet, they're English as a second+ language, in which case, you're a bigger douche.

Basically.  They sold their privacy, for millions of dollars.  They'll be fine.

The lesson should be: While Bitcoin (and other cryptos) are a tool, they're mostly just a way for manipulative people to get rich, since there is no regulation to stop them. 
This is why there can be no such thing as a "free market". Take bitcoin for example,  the market starts free, then, as soon as someone is in position to screw people over (Gox) they do. Insider trading, and taking people's money, and no one to stop them. "Free market"  its an oxymoron.

The kool aid is strong with this one.

Only if you consider drug laws legal, which I don't. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:34:00


Literally impossible.  Bank deposits are secured, insured, and regulated.  Your fucking bitcoins are not. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:35:14
Which is a reason not to keep valuables in your house,  not a con against gold or cash.  You btc people are absurd.

No.  Our brains are severally limited by natural selection.  The human brain is just the combination of all the other primitive brains that came before, stacked on top of each other.  (IE: recent human developments, stacked on monkey brain, stacked on lizard brain, etc) 
Once real AI and the singularity come,  humans will not be genetically capable of keeping up.  We'll be implanting all the brain upgrades that machines invent for us, just to barely grasp the world changing things they'll invent.

Most people, ime, are just pissed off you're not using cash for a fucking coffee. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:33:16


Which is why people invented banks like a thousand years ago.   Stupid.

ftfy.

Or if you live in the midwest where everything takes 10-20 years to catch up.

This whole post is small minded bullshit.  We'll pass everything in the OP eventually.

"they" includes "you" in that sentence. jackass 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:37:13


wtf does that mean 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:36:12
If I knew nothing about BTC, I'd just assume it was an account number for a bank or something. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:13:49
You btc people are assholes. Someone asks a question, and no one has anything useful to say. 
This is why Doge is going to replace you all, and beat this sub to 150k

Your teacher is bad, and should be fired.
