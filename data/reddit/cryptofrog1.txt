"promotes liberty"... check.
"destroys hierarchy"... not so much.
I understand that may be what you and other anarchists want to happen, but that doesn't make it so. Bitcoin may be a tool toward self-reliance and independence - so is silver, for that matter - but it doesn't "destroy hierarchy" except by providing a possible alternative to one element of our centralized society. I do believe bitcoin will have a transformational effect on many aspects of society, but I don't think destroying hierarchy will be one of them.

Senator Johnson-
I am writing to you out of concern regarding Senator Manchin's recent call for a US ban on Bitcoin. In my opinion his call is ill-informed and ill-considered. Bitcoin is a revolutionary new technology, and like other revolutionary technologies can be used for good or ill. Although illicit use is a larger percentage of the US dollar economy than of the bitcoin economy, and cash transactions are more anonymous than bitcoin transactions (bitcoin exchanges follow KYC/AML guidelines and keep track of their customer bitcoin addresses), I doubt Senator Manchin would propose banning cash. Although investment in commodities can be risky to the investor, I doubt Senator Manchin would propose banning private ownership of gold. Technology leadership is an important contributor to America's worldwide economic position, and it would be a shame to lose by default. If you'd like more information, I recommend you contact the Bitcoin Foundation, or you are welcome to contact me directly.
Please draft sensible, thoughtful regulations regarding bitcoin if you must, but don't let it be driven by sensationalist news accounts.
Yours Truly,

Krugman gave two reasons for valuing the US dollar in your quote. You say you think he’s wrong because you disagree with his first reason, but then your explanation perfectly supports his second reason.
The difference between bitcoin, on the one hand, and US dollars and your Peanuts on the other hand, is that bitcoin’s supply is not limited in relation to its demand. Rather it is strictly limited in total supply, period. Dollars and Peanuts, on the other hand, are limited in supply in relationship to demand. Limiting the supply helps give value, but limiting the supply with respect to demand lends stability to the value.

 (the speaker): you don't appear to realize how easy it is for the individual miners who are members of GHash.io to move to another pool if they notice any misbehavior at all.
Much of the increase in the mining network is due to more efficient hardware, not more of the same inefficient hardware (like ordinary PCs).
Although it appears at first to be a natural monopoly, it is not. Increasing scale beyond a certain point decreases efficiency (due to heat). Admittedly the most efficient scale is larger than most miners today. The most cost-effective business strategy results in a moderate number of large miners. In short, bitcoin mining is not a natural monopoly.
Even a majority miner cannot change the protocol. That would be like saying that once you have 50% of the gold in the world, you can start producing more at will. It doesn't work that way. If they "change" the protocol that they "speak", there won't be anyone else "listening" to what they "say".﻿

I don't think he was referring to the monetary base. He was referring to the buying power, which is the standard meaning in economics and the only relevant measure for the purposes of this discussion.
If the 401(k) is invested, then inflation increases the nominal value of the investments by an additional amount over their inflation-adjusted value. In other words, inflation is mainly an issue if he is holding cash in the 401(k) account. Don't do that either.

Simple solutions are more likely. (a) Carry some cash. It isn't going away. (b) Charging stations will be much more widely available. Plug in and make your payment, then unplug. (c) Use a hardware bitcoin wallet, like the Trezor or Butterfly Labs' BitSafe, which does not require power.
For an example of (b) being rolled out today, see

Say that one day I have $10000 and the price of bitcoins is $500. I spend all of my money to buy 20 of them. I watch the prices of bitcoins all day and notice that at one point they reach $450. $450 is a low price for that day so far but I don't want to lose any more so I sell all 20 of my bitcoins instantly, giving me back $9000. That is -$1000 for one day’s work, which to me seems like a lot. Now I know that this isn’t entirely realistic since they take off a small percent off each trade, so I’ll lowball it and say that I would lose $1050 a day. That is still well more than enough for me for a day’s work.

It is not just you. There are many people susceptible to the [Sunk Cost Fallacy](
1. BitLicense is horrendous and appears unlikely to get better.
2. Price seems to have hit new bottoms a number of times this year.
3. Venture capital usually fails, and occasionally wins big.
4. Estimated USD transaction volume has been flat to falling
5. Changetip is a fad and the micropenny tips are unlikely to impact a multibillion-dollar market.
6. There are fewer ways to acquire bitcoins today than a year ago due to exchange failures.
7. Agreed QR codes are not a long-term solution. That's a bad thing for Bitcoin, not a good thing.
8. bitpay advertises "Over 44,000 businesses and charities accept bitcoin with BitPay" but their directory lists 153. Coinbase advertises 37,000 but lists 24. There is evidence that many small merchants (i.e. most vendors who used to accept it) have stopped accepting bitcoin.
9. SideChains are not supported by the Bitcoin protocol and there are no plans to support them. Even if they were supported, there are incentive problems with the design.
10. Bitcoin has been available to institutional investors for some time, and the ETF doesn't seem likely to happen anytime soon. When it does, the fees are too high.

I had the "Aha" moment a couple of years ago. The technology is revolutionary, and can change the world. More and more places accept bitcoin, and that will continue, because merchants have little to lose and customers to gain.
Oh, but you're talking about the price? That's a different story. All those places that accept bitcoin are adding more efficient ways to dump your coins on the market, depressing the price further. What is needed for the price to rise is more and more people wanting and willing to hold some bitcoin not just as an investment, but because having a small amount of "pocket money" makes it easier to get along in the world. Lots and lots and lots of people holding small amounts. The current price is far higher than is justified by the current number of users, especially given how few places accept bitcoin. The usability is not there to make it really convenient even if it were widely accepted, and users are not really jumping aboard.
I expect the price to go far lower before things turn around.

If you think the coins on exchanges are largely fake, you can take advantage of that by purchasing coins and moving them off the exchange. Since the bitcoin network can't hold more than 21 million coins, you'd force the exchange to close down.

1. Banks fail. Greece leaves the Euro zone.
2. Depositors lose all their money due to 1.
3. Businesses all fail due to not being able to send or receive money. Bitcoin's ~3 TPS is not enough throughput for even a fraction of the Greek economy, and most Greeks have no effective way to acquire bitcoin to spend.
4. Unemployment reaches epic proportions. Most Greeks unable to find employment.
5. Infrastructure fails due to lack of maintenance and payment. Electricity, water, internet, sewer systems, roads, natural gas, petrol, become largely unavailable. Widespread homelessness. Government infrastructure becomes unavailable due to lack of employees.
6. Greeks resort to barter and ad-hoc currencies.
7. Greece joins the ranks of the undeveloped countries and begins receiving humanitarian aid in the form of food, medicine, blankets, etc.
8. Greeks with the means to do so flee the borders.

These work for me:
When I sell on the exchanges, I usually do it with limit orders above the current book price. I wrote a trading library/program that I use to (among other things) sell in small increments over a fairly long period of time (days).
(1) Sell on MtGox (slowly), withdraw funds. Since their top withdrawal limit is $100,000 per day and $500,000 per month, it took a bit over a month to initiate the withdrawals. Wait 2+ months for withdrawal to not hit my bank while they try to convince me to accept a 5% "expedited withdrawal" fee. Then hire lawyers in Japan to file for a court order for immediate transfer of funds. After the last step I had the funds in my bank account within 2 hours.
(2) Sell on Bitstamp (slowly), withdraw funds. Also works, much faster and easier.
My "Bank" is a credit union and they have no problem with transfers into or out of bitcoin exchanges.
You can also sell privately, but then you have to be careful not to run afoul of the FinCEN rules which would brand you as a money transmitter.
