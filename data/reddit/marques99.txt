Close, they only accept payments thought BitPay, which is just a 3rd party that converts the BTC to USD for both the seller and the buyer.

The story of this sub Reddit, perfect!

It’s too hard to calculate, because it’s impossible to calculate the amount of money each miner is spending. To many variables like power and weather or not they paid off their hardware, etc. An attacker will need to test the network to determine the cost needed. Maybe some wiz kid can give you a number but in the real world it’s trail and error.

This is how we extract money from the less fortunate :). Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:14:11
But it’s Reddit, we all have a soapbox :)

Question, why do you say I am anger? That is a response from a young and emotional person. Which I am not, sorry.   Ask me a real question if you don’t mind. Something stimulate the mind. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:55:46
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:59:15
Mining difficulty increases and decrease based on hash rate.  So if the price BTC continues to fall while the hashrate stays the same or goes up then yes it will be very unprofitable to mine. BUT if other miners decide to shut down their rigs or call it quits and the hashrate drops then BTC may become profitable again. You need to monitor but the hashrate of the network and the current price.

Be careful what you wish for.

Your welcome

The typical reply in this sub, full of ignorant people. Enjoy your poverty my friend. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:33:15
Being that all of your comment history (that’s crazy) is from r/bitcoin you must have at least one insightful question to ask me. Also after seeing your account I kinda question its validity. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:29:43
I wonder when these bag holders will realize that putting text on a background image is not going to pump their bags???  I mean, like they post this crap for about a year now and yet they continue to lose money. I honestly can’t stop laughing when I visit these subs. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:01:44
lol you fool, I still hold all my investments.  Also crypto is only a small part of my portfolio.  Now the question is, what do I hold and how much???
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:34:56
You have only made gains after you sell, but this sub like all subs are just meaningless circle jerks. Enjoy
