We should only increase the blocksize when it benefits them.  Screw the other traditional payment processors.  That's how that statement is translated.

Coinbase is AWESOME.  I've used them since I started and never had a problem.  I trust them in the bitcoin ecosystem more than any other company.  If I buy a bitcoin from them, I get a bitcoin from them.  Bottom line.

Do you think it would be the end of Intel though?  I think most people accept the government is spying on them and trade away their freedom willingly.

Maybe they don't want people to think they have to spend money.  I suppose you could just get an ubuntu live cd, install electrum, get your 12 word seed off of that and public address(es) and then just transfer to that address.  Then you wouldn't have to buy anything and as long as you keep your 12 words safe, you could always recreate your wallet.

You literally don't know what you're talking about.  The whole thing runs on payment processors.  I linked to a good talk on it but I guess it's too troubling for you to listen to. 
There will be established payment processors and if you don't use those then you're stuck.  You have no recourse if Lowe's doesn't use any other method darling.
I see now why you're excited about it.  You thought they didn't have ulterior motives.  You're funny baby cakes.

I already did.  Some other guy asked.  If you don't work for a processor on the Lightning Network then you won't benefit but you're just dumb and can't see that GMaxwell and his gang only want a smaller block size to cripple bitcoin so they can save it by processing on the Lightning Network. 
You're clearly campaigning so you likely do have ties to them or are just some rando nutter.  
See the fun part to this is noticing that all those that are SO strongly against BIP101 are also EXTREMELY enthusiastic about the Lightning Network.  People that are against one thing aren't necessarily in favor of another.  Yet folks like you just LOVE to rant on and on about the Lightning Network.
Good luck with your campaigning.  
Bitcoin is Blockstream...amiright?  That's what the boys in bitcoin irc chant all the time.  Lol.  No centralization with King Maxwell.

Let me give you some advice from someone that has had to pay for thousands upon thousands of ids before for a large school system.  Technically I have no idea how this works.  Seriously.  The truth is we're goobers.  Now, having said that if you tell me it's 5 cents per id, I can REALLY get behind that.  
I want to know a couple of things though.  What will we do if your company folds?  What is the backup plan for us?  Will all our ids be lost?  Can another company easily take over for you guys to manage it?  Can we be given software to manage it ourselves if you fold?
If you can have plans for those questions and it's only 5 cents with built in backup then you'll make a shit ton of money.  I don't need to know how it works.  Don't tell folks though that it can consolidate all their current ids if it can't.  It feels like a lie coming from my goober, non-technical position.
Answer those questions I asked then start calling up all the school systems in the US and you'll make a mint.

I really hope whoever establishes themselves as the large payment processors doesn't get upset with you.  Imagine trying to buy goods and services and and the established payment processors won't accept your transactions.  Good luck with THAT!
You're simply being foolish.  Oh, you're going to use a different processor...sorry pal, Home Depot doesn't take that processor.  Oh you're going to go to Lowe's...too bad Lowe's only uses Blockstream as a processor.  
You're being naive.   I wish you had access to the IRC logs for bitcoin in freenode.  Maxwell and gang use to brag about Blockstream being Bitcoin.  Their whole intent is to be a first mover in processing payments and establish themselves as the Visa, Mastercard and American Express of Bitcoin.  
You've been scammed.  Good luck getting folks to take your coin if once Lightning is implemented.  You better not publicly question Lord Maxwell. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:16:41
Wouldn't surprise me.  Most people pushing against BIP101 will benefit financially in a major way from Lightning.
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:45:21
So like I said, you're against BIP101 because you're for the Lightning Network.  
The truth is you want to take funds away from miners and give it to the large processors in the Lightning Network.  
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:17:34
This will be good after everyone switches to BIP101.
@_date: 2015-12-06 08:58:25
I watched the video several times and have no idea how this works or what he's even doing.  That was a terrible demo.  
Edit:  
Nevermind.  I see.  He was lying when he said it would consolidate all the ids.  It just creates a new id on their system totally unrelated to all your other ids.  Hell, you can't even store your picture on it from the looks of it.  
This is perfectly useless--a "decentralized" id system where you have to go through a central company to verify your "id".
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:12:16
How much of the Lightning Network do you want?  
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:28:37
Your analysis is incorrect.  
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:20:56
They want to be processors on the Lightning Network and charge fees.  First mover status will be everything.  So far it's the Blockstream gang with GMaxwell and his cronies leading the way.  
This isn't a hard concept.  The Blockstream investors want their return now...or did you think they invested out of the kindness of their hearts?
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:01:23
Why are people having trouble understanding the centralization part?  It will be centralized because whoever you're paying will only accept payment from certain established processors.   It's that simple.  If you have a problem with that processor, you can't pay for your goods and services.  
@_date: 2015-12-04 06:43:27
I love them and trust them!  Coinbase is awesome.  They've been more reputable than any other place.  They are THE most trusted third party in this space.  If they charge me a bit more for that then I'm all for it. 
I don't even trust the others to be around in a year or two.  None of the others understand the value of integrity.  Not one.
@_date: 2015-12-02 05:58:54
Bottom line...for any amounts you care about.  You simply use a separate dedicated device for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:42:20
Sorry Lowe's doesn't take your node as a payment processor.   Do you have Visa?  Otherwise, please put your item back and come again when you've resolved your issues with Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-12-06 16:11:21


No idea what you're talking about here.  I already have a ton of ids.  How is yours going to consolidate the existing ones I already have?  If it doesn't consolidate my existing ids then why say it does?
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:40:57
You think there won't be large payment hubs in the Lightning Network that charge fees and make huge profits?  Lol.
Of course you don't.  This is why you're pushing it.  You know the truth.  You just want to obfuscate it to get others to endorse your views.
Also, Theymos should remove your post since it violates his "policy" of campaigning.  Oh wait, you're campaigning for something he supports.  Nevermind.  Carry on.
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:17:40
It is factually correct.  People will use the largest payment processors first.  Some other guy here posted a perfect explanation.  This is why there is a huge push.  I can link it if you don't feel like finding it.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:22:05
I'm all for that if the blocks increase.  If they don't, I'm prepared to leave the Bitcoin world and not look back.  Maxwell and gang are clearly trying to cripple miners and current payment processors in this space so they CAN'T compete in a meaningful way.  That's the bottom line.  If the block size doesn't increase, it's quite clear the only payment processors that can work as things scale will be ones on the Lightning Network and that's scammy as hell.  Count me out.  I'll consider Bitcoin a failed experiment and move on to another cryptocurrency.  
@_date: 2015-12-06 16:21:19
So you're saying you can't consolidate my current ids--like I said.  You shouldn't even say that.  It's a huge distraction and only makes you look bad.
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:02:46
The good thing is we get to see what will happen.  It's called analysis not opinion by the way.  What you are doing is called characterization--just so you know.
@_date: 2015-12-02 06:02:31
Get dedicated sub 100 dollar laptop, install ubuntu and electrum.  Done.  
You simply do not carry larger amounts of bitcoin on anything you use for other tasks.  
In the future, hardware devices will be built right into your phone dedicated to bitcoin, etc.  Check out Google's project Ara to get an idea.  
Still, it's not hard at all to safely store bitcoin.  This guy knew what  he was doing was risky. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:14:11
No, you're not pointing out logical fallacies.  What you're doing is stating something that is fact which has nothing to do with logical outcomes and is irrelevant.   


Anyone can also drink their own urine but they don't do that often.  Anyone can jump off a bridge but it's not recommended.  Anyone can set themselves on fire but that's also not recommended.  Anyone can get a goat to mow their lawn but most people don't.  
The TRUTH is most people will use a large processor.  You know it.  I know it and Blockstream knows it.  It's not opinion.  It's what WILL happen based on ease of use.  
By the way, anyone can buy bitcoin mining equipment and mine for bitcoins now.  Most don't because that's an irrelevant fact.  The fact is they'll lose money.

I use PIA too.  They are US based and I often wonder if you can trust them.  It's really solid.  Just got it working on Arch too.

She is just repeating what someone is saying in her ear.  She is likely saying it word for word but slowing it down.  Maybe she doesn't wait to say it because her short term memory isn't that great.
