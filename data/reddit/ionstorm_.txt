except that blockstream implemented segwit breaking the chain of signatures.  The base blockchain is the original.  Bitcoin Cash hard forks to implement scaling on-chain.  Bitcoin Cash already has instant transactions that are secure because there is no RBF and will also have instant off-chain transactions with colored coins.

"When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC). Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Remarks: Bitcoin Core breaks the signature chain. Bitcoin Cash is the original P2P cash."

In defense of Mt Gox, it was a good exchange in its time, there was not many alternatives at the time until Coinbase and other exchanges popped up.  I was using Mt Gox and BTC-E at the time, i was lucky to get off there in time.

Because it is decentralized with low fees, now I have switched the majority of my holdings from Bitcoin to a bitcoin alternative due to the excessive fee's.

I use bitcoin cash to transact and save bitcoin to invest, it never leaves the exchange since coinbase also sucks.
