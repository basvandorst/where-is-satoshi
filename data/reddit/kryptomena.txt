OK, but then I need some script to check if I have 2 coins on my Bitcoin account available and if not I need to transfer 2 bitcoins (or less) from the cold storage to keep the 2 bitcoins on the hot wallet available. Seems a lot of work to do and I will constantly expose the cold storage to the network (will it remain cold storage anymore?), when there is the need to transfer 2 (or less bitcoins) to my bitcoin address, so I have 2 bitcoins available to spend for that day.
Another issue is the mechanism sending me the SMS and email after the transaction, but I guess this has probably already been solved by some company, right? Does anybody know about such service sending emails and/or sms notifications for your bitcoin addresses. I am not concerned about receiving money, there are popups/notifications for that already. I am concerned with the money/bitcoins spend (leaving my address).

I agree. The only way that a currency could be respected is the military behind it. If there is no enforcement entity like military, police etc. it will be only a currency for geeks and naive people. Andreas Antonopoulos can talk about Bitcoin 24/7, but until the Bitcoin is finally baked by the US army or some other relevant country's army, it will only be a laboratory-like currency for geeks.

Let's play a game. I will start with these two things and others can add their own things, that are bad for the US business/customers:
**1. No universal Tax ID (Vat ID) like in the EU:**
So, if you want to quickly check if the company really exists or it's a scam, good luck with that process.
**2. Wire-transfer in the EU is much better and widely used among the businesses.** This thing is very 90's-like in the US, meaning that only a small minority is using it right now and it needs to change.

Why not to send the money directly to the person ;) ? I guess it's because the wire transfers in the US are expensive. In Europe it doesn't matter if I send 1 euro or 100 euros to somebody in my country or in Greece or Spain or Ireland (UK, Sweden, Czech rep. - and other countries not using euros are a little more expensive though), but paying for the bills, telephone, internet, apartment etc. is done from the internet banking. Almost every adult person have access to his internet banking account, except very old folks that don't know how to use computers. That's one thing that I like on Europe and hate on the US. It's not perfect though and it still takes up to two days if you are not sending to the account from the same bank. But most transactions are finished on the next day max.

People who are against !ANY! regulations are so wild-wild-west-like. They are exactly like the media they hate. They will be talking 98% of all time just about the 2% of all regulations that failed. They will be ignoring the fact that the 98%, the vast majority, of everyday regulations are useful. Please, don't follow the steps of closed-minded people like Alex Jones or Stefan Molyneux. These people have their own agenda, they are not being scientific and reevaluating their thoughts and are worshiping just the 2% of all the information, that will help their agenda and leaving out the other 98% of stuff they don't like and is disruptive to their agenda. Remember, total regulation and no regulation are two extremes that are a disaster for every bigger society. !SOME! form of predefined external regulation is needed, the software that is called Bitcoin is not enough. If you still don't agree,  imagine that there is no ban on putting out videos where 3 yo girl is having sex with a 60 yo old pedophile and she is bleeding and the pedophile is slapping her (even a freedom warrior like Stefan Moyneux would agree that slapping a child is bad). Disgusting, right? If there was just a free market decision, that would be tolerated, because pedophiles would be willing to pay a huge amount of money to satisfy their sexual desires. That's why free market will never work and we need a mixed econmy, mmixed currency system etc. Deal with it!

Android - 11% - (not affected by this vulnerability)
**iOS - 3,5%**

You can see that I am including mobile devices running on iOS and Android (btw. not vulnerable to this weakness). If i remove Android (a Linux based OS) and iOS (a Unix based OS) the numbers would be pretty similar to the netmarketshare.com stats.
In the US, I guess you would have less Linux users and more Mac OS X users, but in the end it would still make only about 10 - 20% of all desktop visitors.

P.S. I watched/listened the audiobook on Youtube when it came out 2 months ago or so. It was so agenda driven, and b.s. (bad science) that even Alex Jones make more rational claims. He basically told that he knows that there is DEFINITELY no God (atheist) and who thinks otherwise (agnostics) are harming atheist (read Stefan Molyneux) agenda. I am myself 95% atheist and 5%agnostic, but telling somebody who is agnostic that he is hypocritical is b.s. What is being open minded: E.g. As a good detective from Siberia you have to be open minded to every possibility. Even that the killer of the guy in the forest was a headhunter from the Amazon.

That's the problem I have with Bitcoin now. You want from people to be decentralized. OK, but that's not possible, some things can be decentralized (gravity, air, etc.) some cannot (oil, coal and other mineral deposits etc.). The only solution is a mixed economy. Another problem with decentralization is that there are many entities that have different values and communication will become more difficult over time. Example: a death metal head has not much in common with a K-pop fangirl. The successor of Bitcoin will be regulalted in one way or another. If not, it will remain underground forever.

Why are you so optimistic? That's not what our history shows us on repeat. The next sentence is something like a law of mankind: "Every valuable thing has ALWAYS been taken over by bad guys (rulers)." Resources, ideas, money, everything in the human history was hijacked sooner or later by bad guys. It's inevitable. The only question remains, when it will happen, not if it will ever happen. Bitcoin will be taken over. It's only a matter of time. We are greed driven killing machines driven hy hunger for power and success. There is much less cahnce that Bitcoin will become independent than that it will be overtaken by the bad guys and corporations/governments will find a way to overtake/take control over Bitcoin. They will buy/cahnge the right people and Bitcoin will become something different like it is today.

Well, being optimistic is nice, but being naive is not. Assuming that bad guys will never do that and that it will not work is naive, sorry. You are projecting your own values and knowledge to the bad guys from China and Russia (or UK or US, who knows ;) ). But remember that if they have your values they will never start any war for oil or geopolitical and financial interests. We have to remember that some people are evil and they will do anything that can help them to stay in power. That's why I think that bitcoin has to imoplement some "cleaning" mechanism. I will present what I think in more details and take your points to consideration, but I am sure that Bitcoin in current form needs a lot of improvements to be bullet proof (or at least more protected from these kinds of garbage in the blockchain) and one of the things that can help is the "cleaning" mechanism, as I can call it for now ;)

I cannot see Norway in the dropdown on this page  Am I doing something wrong? What browser and what OS are you using to display the page? ;DDD But seriously, the VAT ID, is important for doing business with another country within the EU. You also have to put the VAT ID and the summed ammount of money in the specific trade with the entity that holds the particular VAT ID. It's done electronically every 1 or 3 months (depends on the type of your business entity). The trades could be cross-checked later. It seems to work and several carousel frauds were revealed via this type of cross-check controls. I prefer this German model before the US model anyday. The European Union, despite all the bad things, brings a lot of progressive things into the business domain. I would never want to do business in the US.

You have to think about things in the long run. And that's where Bitcoin will fail. It's not possible to remember everything. That's how our brain works it is removing non-important information. If you want to remember every position of every dust particle in our universe, you will end up by creating a machine that will consume every power available in the universe and it will still be not enough. Why there is a delete function in almost everything inlcuding human brain? The answer is, because it's useful. Bitcoin will fail in the long run if it will not implement some "cleaning" mechanism.

Does every completed transaction NO MATTER HOW BIG IT IS stay in the blockchain or not? That's'the answer how to attack Bitcoin. Imagine a mailbox that cannot delete spam messages. What will happen if there is one real important message among 1 000 000 of other messages or even 1 000 000 000 messages. Bitcoin needs to implement mechanisms how to "delete" the spam that has been confirmed as spam and return the bitcoins back or something similar. i am not talking about 1 or 2 years from now. But the problem will become eminent in 10+ years or even sooner. Bitcoin needs to implement some "immune-like"cleaning mechanisms.

The habits/codes/morals/principles/laws are shaped by the time and are based on evolutionary and revolutionary changes. E.g. you want to have sex, because your ancestors (more than 3 billion years ago) "decided" (mutation/something/etc) to have sexual (male/female) reproduction instead of just asexual reproduction. Revolutionary changes are some catastrophic stuff like meteors or fire or flood or religion ;D. So the "society" is a mechanism of living parts (humans/animals/plants) that want to grow, for some reason. I don't know why (btw. the Universe is currently also expanding, so, maybe it's connected ;D) It could be the selfish gene hypothesis or the expansion of the universe ;D. Or something else. Who knows. But things have the tendency to grow bigger over time, if there is enough room, of course. So, the ULTIMATE ;D answer to you question is that in the end **the entity responsible for punishment are the laws of physics/universe/nature/ or ... even if I am not religious... let's say god/gods ;D**.

I agree. Btw. I think that the BTC is supported by the NWO guys (if not designed by them from the start). And it will eventually replace the dollar and became a new global currency. Notice that the US is very "soft" when it comes to Bitcoin. Btw. I think that one currency and one global civillisation would be a great achievment.

Nice, sharing of proprietary digital work is not stealing. Great. Typical crap of a guy who never tried to sell his photographs or videos. Fuck you lazy commie scum! 


Read this you ignorant: My dad developed various chemical improvements and one of them was very successful plastic fiber creating technology (in the early 80's) that was used for many years. In a capitalist country he would become a millionaire. In the fucking communist Czechoslovakia, they gave him nothing and the communist state stole his idea. The Piratebay/ Grooveshark-like websites are the exact same copy of that kind of behavior. They are just like a communist Czechoslovakian state and they are stealing the work of "others" and are getting rich. The "others" are getting nothing. They are being FUCKED in the arse by the COMMUNIST-MENTALITY THIEVES from Piratebay and Grooveshark. Ask people from the gaming/movie/music/writing industry what do they think about the Piratebay! Ask any of the app/game developers why they don't like to create apps/games for Android and prefer iOS deviced instead. It's not because the fragmented display resolutions for the most part, frameworks can eliminate this problem to a very high degree. The main reason is that their app/game will be pirated in a very short time and shared on communist-mentality thief websites like Piratebay. SATOSHI IS NO COMMUNIST, HE IS A CAPITALIST! SATOSHI WOULD NEVER APPROVE PIRATEBAY AND GROOVESHARK THIEVES!

It's illegal to sell coupons and gift cards outside of the e-shop that has issued them in Europe. This is for the majority for the big e-shops. Maybe it's a different story in the US. The accounting in Europe is much more complicated and restrictive than in the US and doing business in an area where it's only a matter of days or weeks when some big retail chain like Tesco will sue you for illegal activities with its coupons and gift cards is not a good idea.

I don't think it's good when warez commpanies like Piratebay or Grooveshark are associated with the Bitcoin community. If I was a movie/music/game company that has more than 50 people working on the movies/music/games then I would hasitate to be labeled as a bitcoin supporter when so many warez thieves like Grooveshark or Piratebay are parasiting on bitcoin popularity. We should stop supporting warez communities like Piratebay or Grooveshark in the Bitcoin community. They are disrupting the free capitalist market by trying to create some sort of communist sharing websites with 90% illegal stuff and they make money from advertisements. it's against the very bitcoin philosophy. BITCOIN IS NOT COMMUNIST MONEY!. Satoshi is not a communist, he is a capitalist. Bitcoin is a capitalist money. Remember! In a capitalist country YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR STUFF THAT IS NOT FREE!. Somebody worked to create that product. Don't be a coward and PAY. Otherwise you are supporting the lazy "communist" thieves that will steal everything and pay nothing.

Give me one example of a state or group of people that has more than 50 million people and that works (meaning there is no war or famine going on) in your "Anarchy". There has never been any kind of really big society that was anarchic. Anarchy is inefficient and proto-like (viruses, some kind of protozoic life) system that doesn't work for large groups of organisms. You have to lose something to gain something else. You cannot know everything, that's why anarchism is not possible. If you don't want to serve our society, you are a threat to us, like a bad sector on a harddrive and you are causing errors/troubles, so you can try to get yourself together or you will be put in jail/hospital/eliminated/reeducated or become a homeless (in capitalism-like systems).

What's the worst part is that Croatia can make him a persona non grata and he will not be allowed to enter this land anymore. Currently, unless you are a citizen of Croatia, they can do that. Remember, they are not in the [Shengen area]( (even though Croatia is in the EU) and if you, as a EU citizen, are not visiting the country for vacation or tourism for less than 3 months, you are not allowed to stay there anymore without the visas. And Croatia has the right to not issue long term visa for Jedlicka (a citizen of the Czech republic), given these events that are happening right now.  It's similar to the Britain and Bulgaria/Romania in a sense. I am sure that many people here know about Farage from UKIP and his stance on allowing people from Bulgaria to work in the UK. Something, but reversed is here in Croatia and Vit Jedlicka. It's sad that unless you have an army and a ton of money behind your back, everybody will kick you in the butt ;(

Please, notice that Switzerland is not in the EU. Anyway, in the Europe you can say, sorry, I don't remember the encryption keys/passwords and you will not be jailed. In the US, if you refuse to "remember" your encryption keys/passwords, you can be jailed. The US is getting much more tyrannical when compared with the CONTINENTAL Europe. Not talking about the UK, they are maybe even worse than the US. It's not a good time to start a business in the US right now. Europe is much more FREE, when it comes to your freedom. The US is now a police state. There are very few cases when a cop killed a guy who walked on the street and was killed because he was black/gypsy/muslim here in Europe, when compared with the US, where killing homeless guys in citites like Albuquerque by police is a norm. Europe or EU is really a better place to live right now than the US (excluding Turkey, Ukraine and the semi-police state UK, of course ;D)

Yes and therefore there has to be implemented some cleaning mechanism to remove these spamming transactions and even later the "simplifications" of very old transactions, or removing them completely (there has to be some technical consensus how to achieve that).

That's exactly why I am talking about billions or even trillions of spam bots in the future. It would be extremely easy for an entity like china or Russia to create such spamming "organism". They will make the whole blockchain looks like a neverending Mexican soap opera htat has mirriads of episodes, but the content is none. The solution could be to periodically remove of very small or old or banned transactions. that way the blockchain could be only remembering the "important" transactions.

~~Part of bitcoin's purpose is to eliminate the possibility of a reversal. It's built so that reversals can't be made without a consensus, which would also reverse any transaction made in the following blocks.
However, there's nothing to stop one of those companies from~~ using an escrow service built on bitcoin.
