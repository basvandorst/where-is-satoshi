Well it was a joke.

Thanks, checked some of the ebay sold listings... looks dim.  Maybe I will just hang onto them.  Gunna pm you the names and see how you feel.

No I didn't but i will park them and post up a for sale sign.  And maybe some ads. 
Below are some of the domains in question. I may just hold onto them and see how everything holds up.  Any info would be awesome..

I took your comment for sarcastic.  I am asking where to advertise them for sale.

Mow some lawns and throw in some more money, $1 doesn't seem enough to be excited about if prices go up to the stratosphere.

The lobbyists for scam artists are too powerful for that to happen here in the US.

Same here... just got back from the bodega to give cash for my first purchase.   How long will it take to get to my blockchain wallet if everything's kosher?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:25:04
Gotcha... I got logged into blockchain but has an 'Error getting wallet balance'

Can you predict earthquakes?  Maybe we can barter superpowers.
