@_date: 2017-02-02 13:21:52
Don't get me wrong, I think they are offering an awesome service, but for donation purposes I would take a closer look on how they secure data. Imagine the amount of money they should expend to put all those digests on the bc. There are some other experimental decentralized storage networks like MaidSafe which are very promising. The upcoming MU2 will be based on MS I think.
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:06:14
me too :)
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:16:48
how much WAY?
@_date: 2017-02-03 10:36:40
why does it need one? Are you saying that your supposed genius Satoshi AI is acquiring more hardware to work at McDonald's, since it has no body to begin with?
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:37:57
another solution to 1) would be to use an offline decentralized exchange like localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:23:51
They enforce using Xapo as your wallet (blegh) and all your earnings depends on their ad revenue. So it depends on how much taringa earns with ads, and then they pay users accordingly to the points they received for their posts. No micropayments or stuff like that. So the users are incentivized to disable adblock to earn more. but at the end what you earn is little more than fauceting. and there's no active Bitcoin community (all communities are dying on that page)

It reminds me to the quote that allegedly M. Antoinette said to the starving masses: if they lack bread, just eat cake. Something like that...

Oh! it's useful. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-02 10:16:51
Yeah, also their service require a high level of trust, that is ensuring security of the archived data, mostly preventing tampering. It's not just a matter of collecting everything you can afford. how do I know their collected internet history will not be modified in the future?

I'm not sure right now, but I think on a maidsafe like  network there's no need for a centralized repository since all data is distributed by default. Is more like a paradigm shift.
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:24:01
very original idea. you also can use some sort of optic sensor below the mouse to scan qr codes.

clone bitcoin, create your own altcoin with segwit enabled by default and high base difficulty from the start. miners are just addicted monkeys, and bu paid politics may have stagnated  bitcoin. i'm so sad.
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:17:56
It's because of the blocksize debate. search some info:

good for public perception and protecting consumers when buying Bitcoin. but on a full btc world, those regulations will be pointless.
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:03:32
that's why I said to start with a very high default difficulty... somehow. I wonder if it's possible...

you don't need miner collusion to make a double spend on a 0-conf transaction. just broadcast it again with higher fees and wait to be lucky.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:48:31
Yeah, but it would dilute the currency value over time, then we'd see bigger and bigger blocks to compensate the losses and then the centralization of full nodes. bye, btc!
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:52:53
imagine if litecoin ends adopting segwit and through sidechains we can use bitcoin bc as settlement.

@_date: 2017-01-30 11:29:31
The coldest storage I know is a paper wallet. bitaddress.org is an open source (community reviewed) software that you can download and run in an offline machine (running a secure OS like Tails). it will generate a pair of public/private keys that you can later print all the copies you want and store securely (although it does not provide physical sec (f.e. agains fires, water, etc.), it depends on you). It's highly reccommended that you password encrypt it, bitaddress allows that.
Then you could purchase bitcoins on some exchange and then transfer them to the public address of your paper wallet.
If you plan to spend btc more often then I reccommend you to purchase a hardware wallet (Trezor is the best, imo). Hardware wallets would be a separate wallet from the main hedge paper one, filled with enough satoshis for daily basis spendings, that can be plugged in even in infected computers in a secure manner.
One more thing, if you would spend money from the paper wallet, spend it ALL AT ONCE. I won't be responsible for anything I told you here. I reccommend you to make tests with small amounts of btc firt since you get familiar with the process.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:38:48
c'mon, what about black markets like s.r? is totally possible a black market for bread and cheese if govs ban btc.

Why do they laugh at the blockchain question? I swear I would never understand an elitist mind.
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:31:26
That does not offer more security than bip38 itself. You are requiring one password for the encrypted volume and another for the encrypted wallet. and both are vulnerable to physical damage/coercion. just encrypt it with bip38, make a hundred copies, save one at the bank's vault storage and distribute the rest between your family.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:51:01
the one-length hair man at 0:17...
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:38:58
seriously? so they don't know about BIP38 aka password encrypted paper wallets? Bitcoin needs innovation not bs.

yeah, that's the reason of this post, because during some verification I've encountered some things like 'My' or 'LOV' and I thought if someone else had encountered some funny words. just forthe fun fact. security is number one priority!
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:32:04
I get your logic but it's partially incorrect because not all exchanges out there operate in a centralized manner, i.e following kyc and aml. Exchanges like localbitcoins.com and Bitsquare are not subject to such regulations even if govs ban btc :D
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:16:06

@_date: 2017-01-23 16:02:30
when I first knew about btc I also had these kind of questions. implement the payment protocol as someone suggested and read a lot to get to know how bitcoin works under the hood or contract someone else who does.
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:21:19
the video is plenty of ui ideas for btc ��
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:06:09
and selfish mining. but on the overall it's more a damage to the confidence in the currency. imo what will happen under a 51% attack is a btc hf with an updated pow and all the devs/nodes/users will just move and left behind the attackers' chain.
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:17:02
ok, but my point was the economic value for something rare and useful, if it's not secure, then of course it has no value.
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:28:21
I was reading the awesome documentation of 21. I was planning to use their libraries on some project of mine, but it turned out that each off-chain micropayment **must** go through 21.co.
They do offer an *awesome* service (the documentation is awesome), but I want more independence when developing for bitcoin. Also IMO I think that they must change something (don't know what) in order to adapt to the coming LN, which it seems to be more decentralized.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:41:50
yeah! with segwit the block could increase to 2-4MB. that's profit. and with additional layers they could offer another services.
@_date: 2016-11-12 11:33:56
I thought the only infrastructure that Bitcoin needs is the Internet and some smartphone or pc. The atm itself would require the same infrastructure than bitcoin, whats the point of putting an intermediary company between users and bitcoin?

@_date: 2016-11-28 17:07:34
surely i'm not so well informed like you, but i understand that the bitcoin network is not just the miners. Correct me if i'm wrong but bigger blocks not only would affect to miners, also the full nodes will become impossible to maintain. maybe what happened to mining (centralization) might happen to full nodes if we increase the blocksize brutally like BU believers want.

yes, surely the technology will improve, but that's not an excuse to take measures that will put decentrlization at risk. scalability + BU = centralization;

@_date: 2016-11-27 18:35:46
yes, but nothing stops the same mining companies to run cheaper LN payment processors, that may one day process millions of channels (fees). Instead a brutal block size increase over time simply will destroy decentralization, thus the confidence, thus the economic benefits.

"privacy is the ability to seclude information about **you**". If they cannot relate that information to you, you stay private. unless you use *Facebook For Tor*, lol. another thing is the confidentiality of that info.
@_date: 2016-12-04 18:25:13
nope, that's the point. even they can force you to reveal a password, they don't know about a hidden volume, they only know that there's *one* encripted volume. afaik the trezor automatically generates new wallets some how, or they let you separte different wallets for different pins with different balance, i don't remember now. useful for activists who live in oppressive regimes.
