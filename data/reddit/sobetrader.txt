I bought more. I now have 175 coins @ $482 average. My goal was to reach 200 coins by end of 2015, I added 75 on this recent volatility. 
It hurts being down, of course, but I truly believe this will revolutionize banking, online payments. To me it's a buying opportunity. Can it go down more, of course, but if Bitcoin survives this panic low, I think it will galvanize itself as here to stay.

You can absolutely short an etf.

Bitstamp loses 20K coins *that we know of* and a few days later, btc price craters. Mmmmm.... Certainly makes you think.

This has been mentioned before, but with this exchange news recently, Coinbase and Gemini, these are precursors to an ETF. You can't have an etf without a U.S. based regulated exchange. So, the etf is coming, no doubt.

How do you know WS hasn't yet entered? Because it's not publicly announced? Because there's no ETF yet? These things take time. They could have already entered and you wouldn't know. Think about it!

I store offline in a bank vault.

Why do I need to provide proof? If I was BSing, I'd certainly say I have a lot more coins and at a much lower average ;-)

Nice post. We've heard it before, the average joe will never need a computer, the average joe will never be on the internet, etc. We underestimate what can evolve over 10 years. Fact is, people will want to be in charge of their money and technology will evolve to make it consumer friendly, secure, etc. There will come a day when people will want to pay with Bitcoin because there will be consumer benefits. I don't know what those are now, but they'll surely exist. We should not judge the future by today's limitations.

When Bitcoin realizes it's full potential, you won't need to sell for fiat. It will have everything you need: Appreciating value + transactionanalability. If you could buy every day things with Apple stock, why sell your stock for fiat? Alas, you can't buy everything with Apple stock, you have to convert to fiat.  Not so with Bitcoin, when it reaches it's full potential.

You can buy UUP which is going long the US dollar.
