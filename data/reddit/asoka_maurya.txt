Isn't that amount configurable to whatever you want if you are using electrum wallet or something?

They are similar to what are called "numbered accounts" in some banks of Cayman Islands or maybe Switzerland. They just give you a number and you can operate your vault and deposits using that, no name, address or KYC needed. I don't think such banks exist in most countries any more, except the most liberal of nations in Europe. But in the good old days of 70s and 80s (when terrorism wasn't a thing), such banks were found in plenty I think.

How about the more saner explanation that market was due for a small correction after a constant bull run of several years?
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:23:06
Thanks, I didn't knew about that, I was just commenting on the basis that monarchs or kings usually had absolute powers in general throughout history, good to know that some societal order and something akin to citizens' rights existed at the time of Romans. Even in India, such a societal system existed for some time around 350 BCE to 100 BCE during the time of the [Maurya Empire](
However, the Christian texts state that Pontius Pilate, the Roman Prefect in Jerusalem awarded capital punishment (crucifixion) to Jesus just for calling himself the "King of Jews". Maybe, this was one of those instances that you call "powerful men have always had opportunity to abridge the civil rights of others"?

The other basic problem with LN is the danger of LN nodes turning into paypal-like centralized machines, thus defeating the very purpose of a decentralized crypto currency.

Bank transfers are the exact anti-thesis of anonymity these days. the person who puts the "reference in and sends the money" is thoroughly KYCed with all the information like name, address, DoB, various ID proofs, employer details, etc. by the bank before handing them an account. Even the recipient account will have done the same. KYC (Know Your Customer) is a standard practice of banks these days in almost all countries, in fact the law of the land requires them to do that for each account. The only exception are perhaps the banks in most liberal countries like Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, etc.

The bubble bursting may not be all that bad though. For instance, companies like Amazon, Google, etc. aren't yet accepting btc only because of price stability - at the volumes and scales they deal with, it will be a roller coaster ride through their balance sheets considering the present volatility of cryptos. If a supposed market crash results in price stability and less volatility as it usually happens (usd/btc exchange rate doesn't change so drastically everyday), only then they'll start accepting bitcoins. I imagine them waiting on the sidelines right now just for that to happen.

The anonymity isn't about bitcoin addresses, its actually the use of [anonymous bank accounts that has been banned](

Call me cynical, but I'm still not convinced on the uptrend until we go above 19k levels again (that's what the Dow Theory says - higher high and higher low is what defines an uptrend).

Not sure about other countries, but checks and demand-drafts are used a lot at least here in India. Typically by the traditional manufacturing sector.

None of the lower fee is due to Segwit/LN as most would like to have you believe over here. Segwit has been implemented since months and yet it couldn't handle the load, and LN is hardly being used by anyone at the moment. The plain and simple truth is that lower fees are caused by declining volumes as more and more traders are realizing the pitfalls of BTC and fleeing to the only crypto that makes sense, which is BCH.
A simple increase in blockchain size from 1MB to 8MB would have solved the load and fee problem, but they persisted the FUD about Segwit/LN/BatchTransfers instead, and tried to extract as much mining fees as they could from the plebs until the pure supply/demand equation (declining volumes) forced them to lower it.
Moral of the story: Don't invest in BTC, if you do and the volumes increase once again, then so will their fees. None of their FUD like Segwit/LN/etc. is going to actually reduce fees, they are just delaying tactics to keep the plebians occupied while they continue their extraction. If they really wanted to reduce the fees, they would have increased the blockchain size aeons ago like BCH did! Even a blind should realize this plain and simple truth at this point!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:48:01
You are absolutely right. Ignore for a moment that bitcoin is a "currency" (the fact that 1BTC will always equal 1BTC), its use as a medium of exchange is quite limited until the Amazons and Googles start accepting BTC which isn't going to happen any time soon.
The majority of people who are investing in BTC right now are just investing in an "asset class", they are buying it for dollars and its value is measured in terms of dollars, pretty much like that of stocks. Substitute stocks, bonds, land or real estate for bitcoin and tell me how is it different? BTC is actually heading towards the same oblivion where tech stocks did in 1999, or dow jones did in the 2008 home loan crisis. Not to sound gloomy and all, but as you said, it will be only foolish at this stage to invest money in cryptos that you can't afford to lose. Taking a home mortgage to invest money into BTC is a quite terrible idea.

Totally. The anonymity isn't about bitcoin addresses, its actually the use of [anonymous bank accounts that has been banned](


@_date: 2018-01-18 01:09:16
Agreed, totally. Banning or over-regulating bitcoins is getting more and more difficult for the governments, not only because of the rise in liberal values all over the world, but also because its too large at this stage. If ever there was a scope to ban cryptos for good, that train has already passed.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:42:43


You really think so? Just see how it backfired when they tried that shit with WMD in Iraq. Not only did the move backfire, it had many future repercussions as well. They'll be extremely careful with doing a similar thing in future.
Besides, the kind of public that will fall for their fear mongering isn't the kind that will transact in crypto currencies anyway. So, its basically an unproductive move.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:08:25
They don't have to ban crypto. All they have to do is ensure that the amazons and ebays never accept bitcoins and keep enough pressure on the society through fear mongering and media tactics so that bitcoin becomes a taboo for the average citizen (exactly what South Korea is trying to do now). If they succeed in doing that, the value of bitcoins will decrease dramatically.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:58:46
Is there a way to split the blockchain into manageable chunks and then scale each chunk individually instead of one huge blockchain spanning terabytes?
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:42:11
The even bigger fact is that banning btc isn't going to kill it. As long as the blockchain exists on a few individual laptops even in some countries, btc will survive.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:11:01
That's exactly why they have been so hard on the exchanges in recent years. Exchanges is where they will get that data, and most like CoinBase will comply wholeheartedly.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:53:37
But the selling pressure is too much on the higher side. A lot of bulls who entered the market at the early stage (like $200-300 levels) seem to be in a rush to book profits right now. So, though volume is falling as price is falling, the selling pressure is too much to let the price to go any higher. As a result, btc seems to be trading in a narrow range of price points.
We can only say anything definitively once the ath levels of 20k are tested again and how the markets react from there.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:39:06
Still a bitcoin learner, but here is what I think:


This is similar in design to the Tor network. Like Tor intermediary nodes know about the ip addresses, the LN nodes will know about btc addresses and/or transaction information. But that alone shouldn't be a problem as long as the people behind the btc addresses are anonymous and behind a proxy/VPN, right?


I guess the "both end-points agree on a reserve value" he describes should take care of it:


@_date: 2018-01-15 08:04:20
Forget 100 years, even within the next 10 years, the amount of storage required to store blockchain wallets is going to run into petabytes, and doing so will be practically impossible for a common individual on his/her laptop (which is supposed to be the ideal scenario in order for a crypto to be truly decentralized). Unless something miraculous happens and the Moore's Law keeps up dramatically in reducing hardware costs, its a very gloomy scenario we are all looking at.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:53:04


Frankly, nobody has ever tested anything apart from real money because there never was a need to. And more importantly, there never was a thing called **crypto-currency** in the entire history of economics.
Think about it as the problem of trust. Centralized management of an alternative currency involves trust, be it on a person or institution, and this is one of the basic problems that bitcoin solves by going decentralized. Now, who can the people of a country trust more than their own governments?
Of course, people do trust large companies too like Microsoft, Google, McDonalds, etc. and that's exactly why their stocks have such great value too. But its a tad difficult and inconvenient to use those stocks as alternative currencies instead of dollar to trade among themselves, the restrictions imposed by the SEC is just one of the difficulties.
Bitcoin is, in fact, the first of its kind. For the first time in history, people can actually have trust and transact using something that is decentralized and its value cannot be manipulated by anyone, not even their government (its become too large and widespread by now for that to happen).
Of course, the threat of guns and ammos is still there, but society is too evolved now for a government to take down a crypto-currency by shoving guns on their own citizens. Consider that Roman Emperors were such powerful people that they could legally murder and butcher any of their citizens in broad daylight, and also crucify anyone at will, but even they couldn't stop the rise of Christianity!! In this day and age, its practically impossible for the world governments to stop the spread of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:37:59
In a way its a good thing, isn't it? Only because them govts. are hell bent on invading our privacy, the plebians thought of inventing something like bitcoins, no? Evolution!!
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:44:26
Except, after a decade from now, the blockchain size will reach roughly in the petabytes, are we plebs going to have a drive big enough to store a petabyte by then? Judging by what we had in 2008 (a decade ago), I don't think so.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:04:30
Pardon a noob's ignorance, but why would someone spam the bitcoin? Doesn't it cost a ton in a busy network to transfer btc from wallet A to B, why would someone enjoy continuing to have losses?

Actually, the wall street and the bankers are both pushing funds into crypto-market and getting us all the media attention, and trust me, we need both of them in the long run. The bankers don't understand our self-righteous concept of "decentralized borderless open-source secure and consensus based currency", they just want to make big bucks investing in it while riding the wave. And in doing so, they add stake into our ecosystem and make it too large to fail in the process! 
Once our currency starts getting used by John Does as a medium of exchange, sooner or later the world governments will start shoving their guns to make us use their own fiat currency instead of a crypto they cannot exert control over. At that time, these bankers and wall-streeters will stand for us even against the government, because they will have a *stake* in it.
So, moral of the story is bankers and wall-street coming into bitcoins is the best thing that could possibly happen to cryptos!

It all depends on how the world governments react to bitcoin being used in their countries as alternatives to their sovereign currency. Bitcoin has reached to such popular levels that it will soon start getting accepted by many e-commerce portals (at least the small-mid sized ones if not amazon &amp; ebay). Now, if the governments try to fight bitcoin and stop these sellers using bitcoins (fear mongering in media, bring draconian acts, etc.), it will give bitcoin a tough time. If they managed to instill their fear-fear mongering among the plebians so that the average person starts to regard bitcoin as taboo, then the existing btcs will be as worthless as pebbles and you'll see the price plummet soon. The recent South Korean govt.'s fear tactics and the resulting price decline in btc was just one example of it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:17:21
I think its high time you should consider other time-tested alternatives too viz. LTC (Litecoin), ETH (Etherium), BCH (Bitcoin Cash) and DOGE (Dogecoin). All of them have robust networks and wallet software similar to BTC, and can be considered "mainstream" at this point among the hundreds of other cryptos out there. This will not only "unclog" the overused BTC network, but also provide you with more options and diversify your cryptos portfolio.

That's not good. What if I had spent $25 on a bus trip six months ago and don't even remember right now? My bank account will show an ATM cash withdrawal of $25, but what will I answer them when they ask about it? More importantly, why do they need such information at the micro level, should a summary expense like "household expense" or "traveling expense" not suffice?

Well, Edward Snowden is enjoying his life in Russia. Yeah, I know he can't come back home as US is waiting to prosecute him, but compared to what Jesus got from the Roman Empire (Crucifixion), that's not even a slap on the wrist! My guess is NSA can kill him trivially by using their intelligence in Russia, but they are clearly afraid of the consequences (backlash from press and liberal lobby, more uproar for investigations into NSA's methods, privacy concerns raised by EFF, etc.). Besides, he is not even a threat anymore (he has already done the damage by leaking everything he had, isn't it?)
I don't know about Chelsea Manning's current status (is he still detained by the NSA?). In any case, even that is nothing when you compare to the atrocities that happened during the ancient times.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:23:27
Julius Caesar was absolute monarch unlike our POTUS, he could literally kill people without worrying about consequences as he was literally the king. Not saying any of the Caesars used that power though, but they still possessed that power.
And besides, Jesus' crucifixion is a scenario that is impossible to happen in a developed country today. Imagine sentencing a person to capital punishment just because he declared himself the "King of the Jews"! What kind of populace will allow that to happen?
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:34:20


The state is obviously going to fight bitcoin in the end? The only reason they haven't outright made it illegal right now is because Amazons and ebays haven't started accepting bitcoins (yet). Once that starts happening, BTC will become a direct competitor to USD and they will pass something like *Bitcoin Control Act* to stop them from using it. Until then, they are just "diplomatically" fighting by discrediting it in the media.

But if a supplier is willing to accept rice or pebbles as payment for a tv, he certainly can do that. There is nothing in Indian constitution stopping him from doing that.
Of course, some arithmetic juggling is required in preparing the GST invoice of said tv, and GST needs to be paid in INR and not rice/pebbles, but that's a different thing.
