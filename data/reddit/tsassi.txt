Well, guess it's a matter of opinion in the end.

Well I am not saying not giving him attention is advised, he does. Simple.

Depends anyways which "Altcoins", Chainlink outperformed all others obviously. Generalisation does not make much sense I think. The coins that made it over 2 years and have a valid case will still perform.

Yeah, this bug and the obvious non distributed hash rate contradicts the purpose of bitcoin. Now having set up such a scheme which did not, obviously not \[let's change the constant to a terra byte, which was suggested\] is utter nonsense, in terms of validation, in terms of DDOS etc. So this bug was not hypothetical, BCH was just not able to cope with the issues that come along in building such systems. Plain and simple, this incidence was clear proof that they cannot handle the platform that they despise but forked off. Utter incompetence paired with unnecessary embezzlement of the market. And yes on top of it it was a non consented reversal of a legitimate transaction.  
There is no discourse on suggesting the miners prevented something, they did not, they made a 51% attack, that's as simple as it is.

What I am saying is BTC went through this phase already. Yes it can happen on low framented hash rate distribution. I don't believe the market has an incentive to go through it again given BTC is well established.

They were not honest nodes, Satoshi made it clear that a 51% attack is not a legitimate course of action to reverse spendings. And even if "honest" is disputable, it just means that BCH is not decentralized, and it defeats the purpose of the whole game.

BTC/BSV shilling nonsense.

I would not recommend it, except you are prepared to pay some thousand US$ as a fine and/or other legal repercussions. Reckon some are prepared to do so.

Without significant hype? We are in adoption phase, blue chips declared adoption. What does significant hype mean to you, interested...

Thank you. Yes, I got confused 2 years ago and I cannot  put myself up to be accurate on this obvious embezzelments.

Interesting, it was assumed it will happen as anyone could file the copyright. Thanks!

Of course he is lying. bitcoin.org is a scam in your face. The btc subreddit, the CSW nonsense. But the 51% attack made it obvious to the ones that still believed in this nonsense. Bitcoin Cash has no support, noone with something to invest will invest in a wannabe BTC that failed so miserably like the last fork BCH had. Technically released a bug, not at all big enough to withstand a collaboration of only two miners and an obnoxious tail of relabeling attempts of wannabe BTC and a questionable entity still claiming he is Satoshi. The idea will prevail.
