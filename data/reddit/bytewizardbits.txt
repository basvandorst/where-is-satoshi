Businesses even have a name for this phase - a 'scale-up' - where a 'start-up' starts gaining critical mass then needs to rapidly scale.

The current fiat banking system has penalties for when banks misbehave, which is the system the Bitcoin was created to disrupt.

This argument is redundant, if you are investing money you should be completing due diligence. Whether it's equities or crypto. You're allowing your personal biases to impact your thought process. I would imagine you would have such a hostile reaction if Bitcoin Gold was listed on the exchange.

I've not been able to find out whether you are charged transaction fees.
I'm guessing either:
a, you're charged for each transaction. 
b, they're exchanging directly with you via a secondly layer. Ie, buying your Bitcoin from you at the point of use and using a second layer to allocate the funds you hold to your account. In the same way some exchanges work.
I guess the main criticism of the latter would be you would no longer control your coins, they're acting as a bank introducing a trust layer. This would be contrary to the founding philosophy of Bitcoin.
For me as an individual, I am not sure, at present, that the cost of a transaction fee for depositing is competitive, especially considering you lose the some of the benefits offered by Bitcoin (namely asset safety).
That having been said, I'm sure many people are okay with this and is a testament to that.

It's a really interesting dynamic, where peer to peer cash is reliant on exchanges and banks for its acquisition. Personally, I’d like to see more adoption action in the ‘local bitcoin space’ but somebody has to take the leap and buy the first lot of coins.

These exist, local bitcoin for example. The irony is, most can't trade BTC without a second layer offered by the common exchanges used. (because of fees) Thus they're not going to use the peer to peer currency as peer to peer currency.

Avg. fees on Bitcoin are $26 per transaction at the moment... It's why there is a lot of debate on the forums regarding Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin.
