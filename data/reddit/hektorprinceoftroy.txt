Poker site paid 0 fees and now I am waiting for the transaction confirm like half a day. I already complained with them, but is there anything that can be done?

does anyone know, how long does it take for a transaction to be rejected by the btc network and coins put back into senders account?

Thanks for a fast reply. Well I got my 0.5 coins transaction (0a...) from a poker site called, Betcoin - it was my withdraw. I have no idea what do to now. I do not wanna wait for weeks, is there anyway for me to speed up the transaction, pay higher fee?

It sounds like your transaction was rejected by the bitcoin network. An unconfirmed transaction will eventually be accepted into a block by whichever mining pool mines the block, or the transaction will eventually be rejected by the bitcoin network. If a transaction is rejected the sending address or wallet will not see a transaction returning the bitcoin. This is because when a transaction is rejected by the bitcoin network it is as though the transaction was never created, so the intended outgoing funds will have never left the sending bitcoin address. Like all wallet providers, Blockchain.info has absolutely no control over the confirmation process, and cannot expedite transactions. This is always dependent upon the bitcoin network of miners, which we are not a part of. Funds remain with the sending party. You'll need to contact them to ask for a resend. Best of luck.
