Throw that shit in now before you miss out.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:44:10
Because we haven’t mined all 21 million coins... and when you sell bitcoin, someone else will buy it. So I’m selling it at a higher price.

What app is this
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:57:40
Think about it like this. If it really wasn’t worth buying a whole bitcoin, they wouldn’t have made the option to buy .5 or .005 or .00005. My point being you can grow your money regardless and you should be optimistic about it!

I have read those two articles and it seems to as if they (Bakkt) are creating a way for bigger coorporations to get involved in crypto. In turn could this be bullish for cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:52:28
You seem very educated on the Bakkt exchange. Couple of questions before I read the article since you responded so quick!!
1) So Baakt is an exchange, where you would buy bitcoin? What do the plan to bring to the table to be different? 
2) Is the idea of this to create a safer enviroment for investors who are skeptical about bitcoin. I've personally investing since May of 2017. Personally, a very good spot for me to enter but also a very good point for me to learn after the bear market this past year.
I will go read these articles and look for your response! thank you for the sauce!!!
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:34:17
Absolutely!!! When we’re going up this rapidly no telling when a big correction will happen!! Message me more if you’re very new! I could help you out with getting this sorted out
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:42:11
If you’re not a tech guy, you should learn about bitcoin more before investing.
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:22:01
I third this.

Always buy but average in!!! Meaning buy x amount everyday. Only buy what you can afford to lose though!

@_date: 2019-05-05 13:46:52
If you make a personal wallet on bitpay.com it ask for a social.
