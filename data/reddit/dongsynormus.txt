If I were to sell my btc during a crash, and lose numerous coins in repurchasing at a higher price from fiat to digital that's a capital loss right? What happens if I never paid fiat for btc but instead was paid for a a service in btc, would I leverage the loss against the original value?

That's because there's logic involved.

Get a better merchant service provider. Unless it was AMEX, then visa/Mc are easy to win if you have proof it was ordered by, shipped to, and received by the account holder.

The attorney would do it for his/her own publicity (time for exposure vs time for $). Talk what out? They had a chance to listen to the student already. Zero tolerance policies aren't based on logic, so what argument are you going to make to a group of people who don't value evidence? They won't admit they were wrong.

@_date: 2013-04-12 01:37:49
It could, but it isn't going to because there's no reason for it. And a higher price is never guaranteed, don't be a fool, but with the speculation that BTC could become a legitimate currency for day-to-day use, there is a strong argument for a much, much higher price as the demand for the limited number of coins climbs. Lastly, yes it is still entirely possible that these idiot "investors" would still panic and sell because of micro-trading and DDoS problems, you're acting like everyone who invests is smart/level-headed.

I've always used [FastCash4Bitcoins]( The best part being their buy price is always REALLY close to market buy price, low fees, speed and reliability (they have a 43 page thread on bitcointalk which you can read [here](

I always figured it was a honeypot, the dry sense of humor in that name would make perfect sense. 
I also see this as a subversive technique by LEO possibly. If you can't shutter every marketplace you can build your own, screw over the entire user base and erode the confidence people have in these systems. At that point, FE becomes a commonplace as every seller is too scared to leave money in escrow, buyers get scammed more often and the entire idea of a safe underground market is gone.

You really  don't seem to grasp bitcoin properly. I don't mean that condescendingly.  When you say "country of bitcoin" it sounds like it's coming from some sovereign nation which it isn't. It's coming from another person. I don't see any way laws would apply retroactively nor any reason for it. Bitcoin as a crypto currency is unlike anything any government has dealt with before, to assume all that you did is just naive.

the point I was trying to make was the that one r time the people who buy and sell based on panic because of the DDoS will eventually leave the market which would stabilize the price and when a DDoS occurs those were holding coins would not sell based off of the fear of a DDoS alone and thus the ddos would not produce the desired result of a price dip (It would also help if we had more exchanges)
