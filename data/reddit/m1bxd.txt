No economic incentive to use it, only ideological. And say from a US prospective what is on telly is more important than freedom. The bottom line on this whole thread. Only nerds used to be able use the internet. While a CS student I remember being blown away by Unix chat! And email was useless because no else had it...

Does it rules out someone paying the market rate to obtain that sort of btc size or all the auction lots even?

Well spotted, good pro piece in the media. Amazing to see something not negative. If only journalists would start pointing out that because of QE extremis, all fiat money is more virtual than bitcoin. At least with bitcoin there is a relationship to the cost of production. Electricity, mining rig + opportunity. And what does the US dollar represent? Shit all.

yes, but this Bitcoin Wallet extension is more secure already.
1. You can set a password on your wallet
2. To backup your private key, it does not immediately save it in your download directory - it forces you to think about how and where you will store it

Hi Andrew,
On Google Authenticator I am pretty sure the easiest way to implement is using the OATH HOTP standard (RFC 4226) part.
Google Auth - does BOTH types of OTP, time based and deterministic. And this is how it's been implemented in KeePass. The guy who wrote this plug-in doesn't go into details - he only mentions Yubikey support but I got it to work with Google Authenticator and so have others.
 see this page for a step by step:

A great comment by someone at the end: "This is more a piece of commercial spyware than an Operating System."
With regards to bitcoin - you use Windows?
At the end of the day with the "flaws" recently made light of since X86 
And there is a Mac one, which is a complete side attack on a LAN
But they show that there is not a lot safe and the only way to go is something like a Raspberry PI with published checksums and air gapped PCs.
And for the public, I'm afraid they'll have to eat "soylent green" TM.....

Can you confirm my thoughts about the security of using the basic single bitcoin address approach as opposed to going down the full monty multisig in Electrum or similar, which I think involves more user error risk in the process?
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:05:41
Great advice, still waiting for the stats angle from anyone :-)
Apatomoose, sussed 2-of-2 with Electrum, but can you help me with how you make a paper back up of the third?
How about this 2-of-3 deployment:
Prepare two PCs for online, Prepare one PC for off-line signing? 
Print out all the seed phrases for each installation?
Only have one PC for online, one for co-signing. One spare?
Or does the "spare" really matter after set up as it can be restored from the paper seed?
Is 2-of-3 above really that safer than 2-off-2 with one being an off-line signer?
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:45:59
Then don't you have to implement another password for wallet files protection?
Or is this a better suggestion:
Take an offline PC or TAILS DVD with Electrum on it
Generate HD Wallet
Print Seed
Print public addresses off
Send a $5 worth of bitcoin to first address
Check blockchain.info
Send rest of bitcoin to first address
My only thought against that is the inability to introduce randomness. Electrum cannot.
With bitcoinaddress.org when you have generated your first address you can click on Wallet Details and generate a private key using purely dice rolls in B6 format on that page.

QUESTION - has anyone here, acutally read my blog page?
Or have I a misunderstood reddit, as just a digg clone? I actually thought the whole point of reddit - was actually to READ someone's page or look at the piccy, BEFORE upping it or downing it?
Indeed my thoughts are floored because of the 25BTC block payout ASIC collision that  pointed out, but it would have been nice for people to actually read my thoughts first before ripping them up just based on the subject line.

 - because it will be a lot cheaper to mine bitcoins - I thought that mentioning the power consumption, would sort of make that obvious.
Thank you for your feedback.

Shame it only helps three countries! As usual a great load of excitement, does  exist? They've got a great load of supported countries - but no web site.

The site for txtbitcoin.com appears a little techy. MORE countries asap - GOOD LOUCK

True, but it hasn't half given Bitcoin a bad reputation. Was it worth the community/press/media promoting it as heavily as it did - when at the times the melt downs occurred - there were very good alternatives?
They've had YEARS to sort their house out, both technically and regulatory. Or is there something I'm missing here?

On this topic, the paper linked below is a mighty fine read:
Regulating Digital Currencies: Bringing Bitcoin within the Reach of the IMF by Nicholas Plassaras - University of Chicago
April 7, 2013 - Chicago Journal of International Law, 14 Chi J Intl L (2013) Forthcoming
Abstract:      
This paper examines the potentially destabilizing effects of emerging digital currencies on the international foreign currency exchange. Specifically, it examines “Bitcoin,” a decentralized, partially anonymous, and largely unregulated digital currency that has become particularly popular in the last few years. The paper argues that the International Monetary Fund, the institution responsible for coordinating the stability of foreign exchange rates, is ill-equipped to handle the widespread use of Bitcoins into the foreign exchange market. It highlights the inability of the Fund to intervene in the event of a speculative attack on a currency by Bitcoin users. The paper concludes by suggesting two interpretations of the Fund’s incorporating document, the Articles of Agreement, which would allow it to intervene in the event of such an attack.

If iPhone is not jail broken.
The only solution I know atm is to get them to open a bips.me account. 
Then install gliph on iPhone which will install on standard iPhone and Android.
You do the same.
Now you both have identities on gliph. You can then send them btc.
When you create  accounts on bits.me to be used on gliph - do not use an OpenID based sign in such GoogleID, as gliph only supports standard email/password pairing. For a standard iPhone this is the only route ...
