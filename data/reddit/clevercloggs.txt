Fiat transportation and record keeping is electronic these days.
Hardly manual and inconvenient.
 
For overseas transfer, currency conversion sucks but converting to bitcoin is currency conversion and has similar problems.
You cant invest with bitcoin like a savings account or term deposit so leaving money in there is not a good idea even if it's not volatile.
Unless traditional fiat disappears, Bitcoin is useful as a middle man currency with fiat on either side. So how is this more convenient than a direct trade? In fact the only reason bitcoin has the same value all over the world is because you can move fiat currency around the world easily enough already....

Your solution to  saves milliseconds not minutes. You can only save minutes by not confirming the transaction which opens the door to double spend afaik.

In one of those threads theres a news link stating that cp links are already in bitcoins blockchain.... that would suggest that what they were afraid of has actually already happened?

The US dollar has traditionally been the 1 common currency,  except this means the US can impose sanctions on anyone it likes by disallowing use of its currency. Also when the US prints money it causes world wide inflation rather than just within the US due to the quantity of USD in circulation, which would cause problems in any other country. So China has been promoting change here and probably others. 
As a consumer I think the Euro is fantastic but greece crashed because it could not devalue its currency to pay off debt.
As long as there are multiple countries, a single currency is flawed.

Not bad but to polish the gem you need an unwavering focus on the low hanging fruit and push forward with determination to effect a substantial increase in buzzwords.
