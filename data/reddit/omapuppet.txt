Is there a way to see in a relatively low-latency way what the current transaction processing time is relative to the transaction fee?
If so that might be a useful kind of metric for payment software to display when someone is setting up a payment.

I don't know anything about Greece. I thought it was a first-world country much like other EU countries, with big cities and internet and good mobile phone services and whatnot. What is it that is preventing them knowing about and using bitcoin?

A lot of geopolitical BS is permitted by the citizens of a country because they don't know or care about the people in the other countries that are being affected. Fast easy travel would mean that citizens care more about distant places, because they would know people there. Citizens (that is, not big business owners or politicians, who are looking to profit) would put more pressure on leaders to quit being dicks to people.

This is very helpful for understanding what y'all are talking about, thanks.
Let me see if I understand: You put a bunch of coins on an NFC tag in an encrypted container, along with the encrypted key for the container. To use it you read the data from the NFC tag with your own trusted equipment. You give it the password to decrypt the key for the container, transfer coins and then write the updated wallet back to the NFC tag, then clear the sensitive information on the equipment.
An attacker could read the data on the NFC tag, but because the container and the key are encrypted, he cannot easily steal the coins.

Of course, I don't think anyone is suggesting that it isn't. The question is whether republishing it unmodified so that it can provide context for the parody (for people who have not seen the original and so wouldn't understand the parody) is allowable.
I think it's reasonable, not because it is part of the parody, but because it's the graphical parallel to quoting text that you want to reply to. The intent is to provide context so that readers can more easily understand your reply. If copyrights can't be used to block that, then they also shouldn't be used to block this.

Does anyone actually do that?

You're absolutely correct. The email goes on for quite a while, but never says what the customer wants.
When sending business email, start by making sure you clearly and succinctly state what action you want the addressee to take.
Attention is a valuable resource, don't waste it by making someone wade through paragraphs of context before you say what you want them to do, or worse, require them to infer the action you want them to take.

But if you give them the private key, and then the money moves elsewhere, where is your plausible deniability? The only plausible explanation is that you moved your cash.
@_date: 2015-05-03 03:34:06


Wouldn't that just make them pile conspiracy charges on top of whatever else they are shafting you with?
I guess I'm just not convinced that the ability to play keep-away with money they know you have isn't going to be useful for most people. The ability to make it appear to have leave your control is though, so I guess it's probably mostly a matter of planning ahead.

So, hypothetically, if one wanted to store a cash income stream amounting to several thousand a month, would it be realistic to buy local bitcoins? Would one need to be in a relatively large city to do that? How do you do a local bitcoin transaction for large values safely?

Yep, you shouldn't keep any more liquid funds than you need to cover your operations, the rest should be invested where they can work for you.

In the USA at least, part of that is because the poor are under-served by banks. Banks like to do business with people who provide them profit, and doing business with poor people is less profitable than with non-poor people. Banks only have so much capital and time to spend on profit-generation, so they put it where it makes the best return, which is not poor people.
As a result poor people tend to use cash more than others. They pay check-cashing companies and take cash, then spend it immediately. They don't have much need for banks to protect their assets (savings, investments, etc) because they don't have any assets.
Using cash tends to be inefficient and expensive for poor people, but they don't have any other options. If they could switch to BitCoin they'd be better off, but it's still rare in the US for this population to get a lot of benefit from BitCoin (most jobs don't yet offer the option to take pay in BitCoin, and utilities, groceries, rent, etc are usually dollars). That looks like it's changing though, so perhaps in the not-so-distant future the poor will be better off though BitCoin.

I don't know what the reporting requirements are, but I regularly take amounts around $1000 out (every week or two). If the amount is over $1000 I have to go inside to do it (they won't do it at the drive-thru window). That may just be a local policy.

By that do you mean you think that simply buying and holding bitcoin will result in substantial gains? Do you expect the BTC to USD exchange rate to go up a great deal in the future?
I don't currently hold any BTC, but if it's likely to go up a lot it might be worth getting a few to sit on.

The lender just has to charge enough rent on the loan to cover the cost of deflation.
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:50:58


Banks don't have to make loans to be a bank. They could just hold your money and provide the services that allow you to easily send and receive money. They mostly don't because they would have to charge their customers the full cost of providing that service, and very few people would be interested in paying those fees.
There's a parallel to ads on the internet here. Banks making loans is kind of like websites using ads to pay for the service.

I suggest that you try to avoid using the 'able to be' construct in the passive voice. The result is awkward and assigns ability to the wrong actor. Try either active voice ('Thieves are unable to break the glass window') or avoid 'able to be' ('The glass window cannot be broken').
It's not unusual, and you'll be understood, but its awkward and easy to avoid.

Your company would have to convert the bitcoins to dollars to pay the IRS, yes? But you'd be able to offer returns as bitcoin too.
It seems unlikely that it would be very popular or profitable, and you'd be taking on some risk with the fluctuating value of bitcoin against the dollar, but it would be an extremely cool thing to do.
If you can find a way to do it without too much risk, it would definitely be a cool thing for the cryptocurrency community.
