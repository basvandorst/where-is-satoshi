Thanks for the link :) (sorry I was on mobile) 
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:15:42
 Something like this?
Edit: OP plz respond. It almost kinda works a little bit
Edit 2: pls OP just a yes or no
@_date: 2014-01-16 11:44:15
And you don't know how to use google either? Search "Blockchain iTunes"
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:07:41
Can you check the current balance on theirs? So I could see how long until payout (or make a guess myself, anyway). I'm on BTCGuild but I'd like to move after the next payout on my account 
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:50:10
Have you thought about an iOS app for this? I have a first gen iPad I'd like to use, and there aren't any payments made within the app, so there shouldn't be and ToS issues
@_date: 2014-01-16 10:31:32
Why does everyone think this isn't possible .-.
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:18:16
What's the minimum payout ._.
@_date: 2014-01-24 13:25:45
Mine was sent through 33mail so I can't check .-.
@_date: 2014-01-24 13:18:50
Yeah, that's what I thought. There do seem to be a lot of spelling errors in that email.
@_date: 2014-01-16 11:42:02
Pretty sure it's still there ._.
@_date: 2014-01-16 11:32:17
They blocked coinbase because you could purchase things in the app using a system other than apples in app purchases. There's no way they don't know about Blockchains wallet app. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:57:39
10* what I have :p
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:17:30


@_date: 2013-10-29 12:06:27
Where did the second one come from? ._. I mean, I guess it counts but it would be more impressive if you mined it yourself 
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:57:50
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:51:22
You need to learn to say more things then ._.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:19:16
It can as long as there are nodes connecting the two spaces
@_date: 2013-09-29 12:42:44


@_date: 2013-04-12 02:05:14
Please read over the usernames :/ This wasn't my AMA
@_date: 2013-07-22 22:58:33
Wouldn't this leave everyone's name and address public in the blockchain, and easy to find if you have the address you need to pay to?
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:41:22


you fucking off.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:38:52
That is a great word and should be used more often 
@_date: 2013-09-04 10:13:00
I'd just send a higher than average transaction fee ._. If it was important to me, anyway
@_date: 2013-06-05 13:05:39
Thanks jim! &lt;3
@_date: 2013-07-24 03:51:30
Can I have the hug? :(
Edit: Are you still offering the hug? Please? :(
@_date: 2013-10-29 02:44:20
I prefer coinbase, but I think that's just because it's what I'm used to using (my wallet isn't coinbase, though) 
@_date: 2013-06-17 19:05:22
Hey, did you ever end up buying it? I'm kinda interested now
@_date: 2013-08-20 21:33:03
Yeah, that would make sense, I guess ASIC miners are a lot faster now
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:04:52
Why does he want to be so private :/
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:51:00
That's awesome of you, but I don't really need any hosting right now ._. sorry :( *hugs*
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:09:34
It might happen, but that depends on the price going up (a lot) ._.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:08:41
what does flip mean ._.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:40:44
I'm not sure what programming languages you use or anything, but it should be pretty easy to set options for both (sound and update time)

Would 400MH/s make $1 in a week? I just bought one of these and I'm gonna try running it with my graphics card
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:53:30
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:55:47
it's super interesting (it's not)
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:57:25
I get most of my online money through paypal, so it means that there's no easy way for me to get more bitcoins :/ 
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:22:08
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:22:14
Probably use it to start mining, maybe sell them all and act as if I just won a lottery (small lottery I guess)
Edit: I don't check my wallet every day anymore so I wouldn't notice for a few weeks maybe 
@_date: 2013-09-08 05:40:34
I just pay to the right people. They've got some ratings from previous loans and they've linked a few accounts to show who they are.
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:30:05
awh that sucks :( If I have like 50 of them it would maybe make money at some point? I might have to check this at some point
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:50:32
Ew it used mtgox for the exchange rate 
@_date: 2013-09-07 03:23:57
Ebay costs too much and LocalBitcoins doesn't have anything near me ._.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:58:31
As much as I love bitcoin, I don't think it's a good idea to be paid in bitcoin yet. Not sure enough places accept it .-.
@_date: 2013-09-10 20:35:50

@_date: 2013-11-11 07:12:09
I'm only a cat sometimes

Is it really 700? ._.
@_date: 2013-09-18 06:24:29
I think I'm the only person on reddit that doesn't hate paypal ._.
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:28:30
Are they against bitcoin over there? ._. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 10:17:53
 I have no idea apparently
@_date: 2013-09-20 08:05:43
I can't see the photo :( no facebook 
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:59:59
I like how it's Pi in mBTC :3 (I think, not sure how much 1 mBTC is)
Edit: Pretty sure I look like a noob from this
@_date: 2013-10-13 20:16:30
Yes, that's what I said .-.
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:29:01
I could get two, but I'm not sure about how many USB ports I have. I'm thinking if I ever get more than three I'll just buy a powered USB hub and work my way up to having 8 of them which can never pay themselves back :o
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:38:05
There will be end credits.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:22:42


Is this one still true? I thought the value of bitcoin kinda ruled this one out.
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:21:38
Don't they go under extended? :/
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:53:08
 is a quick way to convert the bitstamp price to other currencies ._. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 08:09:33
what is this shit
@_date: 2013-09-27 18:11:18
Definitely. I almost bought a 5GH model when they first set up, I'm sure I would have gotten it by now if I ordered so early, although I'm still happy I never gave them my money. I'm slowly building up a block erupter farm now. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:29:04
I think it was the first thing that didn't involve only developers
@_date: 2013-06-07 21:47:06
Well, if you're not going to be using it then there's probably no point of me buying an account there :/
@_date: 2013-08-01 19:40:20
Still not helping ._. You're not even telling him to not do it again, you're just telling him he was bad for doing it (also don't do it again)
@_date: 2013-10-06 00:40:35


I always felt the same thing, still not sure why though, there's no reason the content would be any different... 
@_date: 2013-06-16 13:31:15
Gay porn
@_date: 2013-06-25 19:37:49
:( Why didn't you tell me this before I sent the guy money for an account
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:09:43
Why are you using internet exploder?
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:03:36
You're an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:31:47
Yes x4
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:20:54
._. It's not possible to brick an iPhone anymore
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:12:35
If you type something a lot, iOS saves it as a word
Edit: also this 
@_date: 2013-09-27 18:37:32
It's weird how many people have ordered things :/ did you get a refund?
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:27:49
Will it have gay porn?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:04:33
Maybe it searches for virtual box drivers? ._.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:52:06
I was going to reply with a funny but then this happened 
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:49:43
No one wants to use your forum but you keep posting, and you keep getting downvoted. Go away.
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:56:00
If you wanna make another one that's cool too, competition is always nice enough. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 15:45:57
I nearly ordered the 5GH when the company first opened ._. I feel pretty good that I didn't now.
@_date: 2013-07-31 18:24:45
He does this a lot ._.
@_date: 2013-09-08 00:48:27
Everyone I've ever loaned coins to has paid back early ._.
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:37:38
What's the difference (sorry for noob question, just seems like the only difference is what you can do with the currency/shares, and even that isn't so different)
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:13:00
I'm happy to put $1 into a qt wallet in virtualbox if you like
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:18:14
do you like cheese
@_date: 2013-08-05 10:34:43
Probably, as long as you don't use them.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:37:03
Yes! My dad (who doesn't understand bitcoin at all) asked me how far you can divide a coin, or if it was just to 0.01 coins, and I think this actually could help gain new users who don't know that they can spend less than $1 at a time
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:32:40
._. just ignore me...
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:34:00
0.0041173 BTC ._. 
Edit: My friend used to mine coins and he stopped so I stole the coins from his account (he said I could), I have 8.11212 mBTC now :)
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:21:43
You're not an idiot with a point, you're an idiot with a shitty forum.
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:27:18


So not the US government :)
@_date: 2013-06-07 10:45:18
I don't know who they are, but I do have enough bitcoins to buy a plan there if you'd like me to try it
@_date: 2013-09-08 06:50:47


Maybe, but I'm not really loaning out coins anymore anyway. I think that if someone did default, it wouldn't be a massive problem anyway, because I'm not loaning out that many coins. But I don't know if BTCJam will ever go after anyone if anything happens.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:21:58
They changed it and now blockchain can't update the app because apple would just reject the update (and possibly take down the entire app) 
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:47:46
Random hash generator.
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:49:44
As with any currency, Bitcoins have been associated with illegal online activity such as money laundering
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:49:10
Wait.. what AMA did I do? ._. confused
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:32:12
Because some of them might be trying to fix it ._. and it would be unfair to blame everyone for it
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:20:04
It is really simple, you don't need any programming skills, although I wouldn't buy from BFL yet, they don't seem to be shipping and they seem to keep moving the shipping dates back.
@_date: 2013-06-25 22:32:50
Noob here, why does bitcoin have fees? ._.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:14:35
People do think this, and there are people working on this problem right now. I think there was something about a dynamic transaction fee, so it can change by market value .-.
@_date: 2013-06-20 12:22:35
That actually sounds like something he would say ._.
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:15:37
Sent :) If you want to pay it back whenever then that's cool, you don't have to though.
@_date: 2013-05-08 15:28:37
If you're going to send them the coins for cash directly, send the coins from your phone while you're with them. That way they can't claim you didn't' send them.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:04:49
I was actually going to make something like this (with sound), I'm just too lazy to work out the mt.gox API right now :P I'll tell you if anything happens
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:20:34
I didn't sell, and personally I think this was a good thing. As a merchant, I wouldn't want to use a currency that changes value so rapidly. Maybe this will help to stabilize it
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:20:04
So.. it's like eBay for bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-09-07 16:21:57
I'm not sure of the exact balance of my account in USD because paypal always has a weird exchange rate ._. and when  I send paypal, do I send it as a purchase or gift?
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:03:57
It's a real coin. You get them the same way as bitcoin (mining them or faucets etc). Not worth much though. @_date: 2013-09-27 16:56:36
Their mining software does look better than most others ._.
Edit: I take that back, I downloaded it and it's too tall for my screen (768 with a double hight task bar), and you can't resize it. And those borders around the buttons :(
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:09:02
What's your bitcoin address? Haven't quite worked out the reddit comments thing yet ._.
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:17:20
I still GPU mine ._. I get like 0.01 every 3 days...
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:35:36
 This one has seven :3 
@_date: 2013-09-28 09:49:30
Well, depending on how early I ordered it I might wait a few more months now, it looks like the might actually be starting to ship 
@_date: 2013-09-02 01:04:22
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:41:26
What .-. What does that even mean
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:00:02
5 and 30 did work for me, and 19 didn't ._.
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:07:21
This sounds a lot like 
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:50:44
I have no idea what you just said
@_date: 2013-06-05 09:17:50
I bought a permit and I'm on the server.. now what? ._. the teleports seem to be broken
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:34:40
I pay with bitcoin but I don't have a coinbase wallet, it's still pretty easy (except that one time I had to do the whole thing on an iPad)
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:03:42
Am I the only one wondering where the gay porn is? ._.
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:29:52
sigh. people don't understand jokes
(Your English isn't so great either, by the way)
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:32:52
Joke coin (real though, if you wanna download it)
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:10:18
I actually really like this idea :)
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:31:24
If you like I could just send you the bitcoins and you could try it out yourself? 
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:08:12
Well, I'm not paying for power so I might make a bit more
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:32:55


Uhh... Because it's spam?
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:56:19
Instant confirmation ._. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:38:37
._. I nearly bought some coins back when they were £8, then again at £16 :( I guess it's stupid to complain now, but I don't even have access to my bank account anymore so it would have helped a lot even if the price didn't go up
@_date: 2013-07-06 00:51:53
Derpy.

Looks like it's down
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:22:02
I think you can add things to contacts like relatives now, even if the name your adding isn't in your contacts. You could just have one contact called "dirty words" and he has 50 parents called fuck shit and cunt .-.
@_date: 2013-10-13 15:42:17
I don't know :/ I just use it for photo backups 
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:26:19
Welcome to reddit! 
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:23:22
I have some money in cash/paypal ._. what do I do
@_date: 2013-09-07 17:05:17
what ._.
@_date: 2013-05-22 09:31:03
Meh. I'm in England, if I was ever going to move to north america, probably would be Canada.
Edit: Does Canada have enough money to do that?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:12:42
They didn't say what year
@_date: 2013-10-13 00:35:20
Personally, I use copy ._. They give a lot more space than anywhere I've seen. Would be great if they had bitcoin support :)
Referral link: 
Regular link: 
Edit: Slight privacy issue here, I have the first name and last initial of all 5 people I referred, and I'm sure they have mine.. ._. Still nice to have the extra 25GB space
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:28:54
Well, I guess it would be possible to own a bitcoin without a smartphone, but it would be a lot harder to spend the coins offline.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:36:17
Why can't it be?
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:33:45
Maybe we can work on it together? :P I was just going to make one for myself, check the price every 10 seconds and play a sound to tell me if it went up or down
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:13:36
.-. Yay bitcoins (but why) 
@_date: 2013-08-01 11:54:24
I feel like that didn't help him get his money back.
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:08:57
Could at least help in some places where the address book doesn't have name space
@_date: 2013-09-23 16:45:27
Uhm, why are you linking to hotmail?
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:52:36
Amazon for bitcoins? Or is this meant to be unlike any current website?
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:31:47
 can they explain this ._.
@_date: 2013-08-05 16:03:03
what about the shitty library printer ._. I'm only printing photos of the notes for studying 
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:03:07
Yeah, I saw that
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:55:31
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:35:15
Why was trading allowed during the lag?
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:27:27
I'm not sure anywhere has enough for that.
@_date: 2013-09-02 05:25:09
I've accidentally sent some smaller transactions with no fees before, they do get processed a lot slower but I guess with a transaction this big speed isn't the main factor. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:46:34
Tell me if you find anything about the API? I guess I'd just need a txt output of the price
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:49:49
I think 1cBTC is 0.01 BTC, so 50 would be 0.5BTC
