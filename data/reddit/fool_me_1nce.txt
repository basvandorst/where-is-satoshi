I bought right after the crash, so it's gone up about 10-fold.  In an attempt to give back to the community, I've been spreading it around to friends whenever I get an opportunity.

It was an **email** address.  Coinbase lets you email money, which I used to think was really cool.  If the person doesn't have a Coinbase account, coinbase sends them a friendly email asking them to open an account to retrieve their coins.  All it takes is a password, then they can move the coins.
Actually I texted the money using Coinbase's SMS service, but it just as easily could have been in the web browser.

Agreed, mostly my fault.  I used to be really careful, then got too relaxed after sending a hundred transactions.    I do know it was a completely new user.

It's already taken, but thanks for the idea.  It was likely created a long time ago, as it's a fairly common name.

My intended recipient also has a Coinbase account, so it's very secure as long as you get the email address correct.

Ummm, because I don't want my regular alias associated with my stupidity.  Here's a partial screen shot showing 10 BTC getting sent to a new user

Because the transaction says it was to an unknown user:

A little concerning that he has trouble with basic numbers.  He can't seem to figure out what half of 12.5 is, then a few minutes later says inflation is currently only "2%".  It's actually about 12%.  
This guy is writing THE book on Bitcoin?

Did that several times, with no response.  I doubt the other person is even in this country.  The transaction was initially broadcasted somewhere in Africa according to blockchain.info

Thanks, that gives me hope!  It struck me as against the odds that I happened to send to a valid email address, *who just happened to know* how to quickly launder the money.  
I sent Coinbase an email this morning, but haven't heard back yet.  I'll update and send you a tip if you are correct.
