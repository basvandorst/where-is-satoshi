And that is why you don't have the capital.

The Mt Gox story deserves more play than a financier walking off with 200 million dollars. Mt Gox was a much bigger player in the bitcoin market than Joe Lewis is/was in the foreign exchange market.

Overstock.com has been a dog for a long time and everyone knows it.  The company has never been a hit financially and even had a period where their loud mouth CEO went on a campaign against naked shortsellers in an attempt to deflect blame for the company's poor performance and lagging stock price.  If anyone thinks that Overstock.com's move to accept bitcoin for payment was anything other than a marketing stunt they are fooling themselves.  Also, I should correct that previous statement.  Overstock.com does not accept bitcoin for payment.  They accept US dollars from Coinbase.

This is actually getting a huge amount of media coverage. Joe Lewis is an very prominent figure on two continents. He was an important figure in the collapse of Bear Stearns as he gave the bank about a billion dollars in cash weeks (maybe days I dont remember) before the bank unwound.

It's all good man.  The shame with these silly arguments is that I dont totally disagree with what the original guy said just his attitude and the way he justified it.  We can talk all day about the opportunity cost of investing in bitcoin.  For instance if you could have got 1% in a savings account over 1 year but instead you put money in bitcoin and lost 10% of the same year then the opportunity cost of investing in bitcoin was 11%.  However you just cant look at a decline in asset value as an opportunity cost on its own.

There's no helping you. Good luck with your "investing."

This is such a stupid comparison.  As soon as the credit card companies are made aware of the breach they can cancel every single one of those cards and actually prevent consumers from being hurt.  When some hacker breaks into an exchange somewhere and walks off with thousands of bitcoin there is no one who ca step in to get those people's money back.

This is really amusing.  "Let's say 500kbtc."  Really?  Why just say that?  You have speculating and have no real information to base that on.

News organizations are motivated primarily by the idea of being the first to report something.  That is the utmost priority.  I know a lot of people believe conspiracies about shadows organizations or people manipulating the news but those stories forget the fact that there are thousands of regular people at work at news organizations all trying to break a story.  Bitcoin is all the rage these days and people are asking questions.  Any news organization with the slightest bit of interest in pageviews would have an article up about Bitcoin right now.
The math is simple here.

This sentence literally does not make sense because it is a misuse of the term opportunity cost. Not selling at a higher price is not an opportunity cost. The definition of opportunity cost is very simple. It is the difference between the value derived from how you are currently allocating a resource and another opportunity you currently have for that resource. The best alternative forgone has to be currently available otherwise you're not forgoing it. If it is something from the past, as selling at 1200 was, it is not an opportunity cost.

You could never pass for a lawyer.

There's nothing for me to explain.  You have linked to 2 fantastic resources that explain very well what opportunity costs are.  Somehow, in reading those explanations, you do not get it.  There's nothing for me to explain as you have already proven to not understand 2 resources that can explain it better than I can.  Good luck with things.

Something is wrong with you man.  If you are son confused by this you really should just take a basic macro econ class.  What you keep describing is essentially a mark to market trading loss.  I'm not going to try and convince you.  As I said before, the resources (wikipedia &amp; investopedia) that you linked earlier do a great job of explaining it.  Reread that.  Maybe go over to and see if anyone there with a phd in economics can explain it better.  I only have a BS.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:56:38
Dude you really don't get it.  First of all I'm not saying that you don't have a valid reason to be upset.  If you've lost money then that sucks.  But you really, really don't understand the concept of an opportunity cost.  Reading a few things online is apparently not helping you because you have misunderstood what you're reading.  I defy you to find a single trader that refers to the situation you describe as an opportunity cost.  
The link you provided to Investopedia actually describes the concept of opportunity cost very well.  You really should read it again.

And TIL you also don't know what mark to market means.  God help you.
Edit: You also keep editing your posts after I respond.  Good luck with the rest of high school.

Nothing you said here has anything to do with economics. Also, the example you provided has nothing to do with opportunity costs.  Stop talking down to people.

Anyone who claims to "believe" in bitcoin while simultaneously cheering the price increases is really just a hypocrite and a speculator.  It doesn't really matter what anyones opinion is because it is a fact that if you want to use something as a currency in the long term it needs more price stability than bitcoin has been able to provide so far.

Not selling at a higher price is not an opportunity cost.  The definition of opportunity cost is very simple.  It is the difference between the value derived from how you are currently allocating a resource and another opportunity you *currently* have for that resource.  The best alternative forgone has to be currently available otherwise you're not forgoing it.  If it is something from the past, as selling at 1200 was, it is not an opportunity cost.
