It really doesn't matter if he is making it up or not as trying to "disprove" him is only leading to reinforcement of the negative stereotype of Bitcoin users to the outside world.  If this thread was nothing but "Yes, no one should suffer harassment from strangers on the Internet" the thread would be done already.

New user that seems to be following changetip bot and then acting like they've never seen a tip before.
EDIT: Mostly I just want this to serve as an example to try due diligence before tipping a random person $10 because they "seem" interested.  No need to throw away good money.

Are you asking *how* you can setup Bitcoin into your website?  That kinda depends on how you want to use Bitcoin as a company.
The easiest answer though is to look into coinbase or bitpay.  They offer Bitcoin integration with a variety of features.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:46:17
Well, there ya go. :)
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:17:08
If he had to wait a week and couldn't get a hold of anyone until he posted that they were a scam then it certainly sounds like he *didn't* overreact in the slightest. It sounds like he perfectly reacted.
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:09:41
The point is the "questions you have" are irrelevant here.  He is claiming he is being harassed and all you are doing is furthering the harassment.
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:32:47
You gotta be a special kind of stupid to be surprised that a pro-bitcoin group likes pro-bitcoin news.  I'm not sure why trolls think that this subreddit should be held to some higher level of self-control than any other part of reddit. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 04:20:06
Yes, that is correct.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:10:06
But...but..but I thought Bitcoin was the only market in the world that ever went down! Are you telling me that all the trolls here *don't* know what they're talking about?!
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:41:27
Another exchange that has been having various complaints against it for a while about to go under.  Gox all over again.
Take heed all you BTC-E fanbois.
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:10:47
I'm just saying that you talk a big talk, but you walk the walk of a weak and injured kitten.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:12:08
Surprised we still allow links to these sort of "news" sites.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:14:53
That would also apply to them, yes.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:17:00
I've *heard* on a number of occasions that more and more cc companies are adding lines in contracts saying they aren't allowed to do that sort of thing.
I don't any any personal experience, but just something I've heard. So there's that.
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:46:05
To all the haters: I'd rather have a dog come up and take a diarrhea dump all over my shoes then use an android phone again.   Windows phones lack apps so far, yes, but I've never had it crash, freeze, go slow, or any of that crap.
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:09:29
I'll take the number of downvotes you got as "Yes, yes it has".
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:29:11
So, you don't want any accountability for your actions then?  Limp along little kitten.
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:10:53
Well, there goes my furry-based pirate themed fanfic featuring Bitcoin idea! God dammit!
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:03:41
You're doing this right now: 
Please stop.
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:16:54
Then all you're doing is feeding the "obvious troll" and should stop anyways.
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:14:26
To be fair, shit would be crazy if the first answer was always yes.
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:46:05
Cool story. Wish I could somehow negative tip you :/
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:34:50
Thank you, but I have enough coin. Share the love elsewhere :)
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:52:38
I don't have any first hand experience from the merchant end, but they do offer help in integrating into websites (see: overstock.com) and then coinbase also offers you more control as to how much you keep in bitcoin and how much you convert into USD.
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:48:13
What is the number? That way I can be sure *not* to call it.
But seriously, people, don't do this. You're almost as bad as buttcoiners by being that annoying.
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:25:28


Well, for starters they are involved with dogecoin.  Seeing the obvious isn't in their skill set.
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:01:47
Don't wanna sound rude, but the bitcoin2fund.com has all kinds of weird issues. Doesn't make it look "legit".  Just honest feedback to try and help.
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:54:35
Pointless crap.
There. I researched it for him.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:54:52
"Price doesn't matter, you have poor infrastructure!"
"Infrastructure doesn't matter, the price isn't going up!"
That's the eternal waltz that we've been hearing since Bitcoin was less than a dollar.
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:19:46
It'll be like at the end of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" but instead of his heart growing three sizes too big it'll be his anus...
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:00:09
I love it when buttcoiners try to act all cool and then flip their shit almost instantly...they become a parody of themselves.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:22:05
Yea, let's support Bitcoin and those working to make it better by *stealing*. You are a genius! I bet your mother is very proud of you.
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:39:33
There was a police station somewhere on the east coast of the US that had to pay up to unlock a bunch of files that were encrypted via virus a few years back. I can't recall 100% if they used Bitcoin or not, but I think they did.
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:18:51
Facts are rarely a part of troll logic.
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:07:09
He's just swing that zerohedge is NOT a valuable or reliable news source. They may be factually correct on this particular article, but that this would be an exception to their normal fare.
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:10:59
That's the thing I don't get.  Anyone with a pocket full of sense can sit down and realize that it will be extremely hard to even *break even* on any sort of mining venture let alone make a decent profit.  The only way you can really expect to win the mining game is to hope the price increases quickly, but in that event you would have made more money just buying Bitcoin instead of "investing" in mining.
And cloud mining is an even worse proposition, but people still seem to be falling for it in droves.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:42:09
Oh goody.  Always gotta be bad people trying to ruin something good.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:28:01
Be our guest. I'm sure if you set the example others will follow.  I'll look for you in the papers!  Maybe write some sort of code word on the wall with the blood of your victims so we know it was you.
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:53:38
Oh, but it *is*.  But really, it isn't. Unless it is! Which it is not, but it might be! Not really though.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:35:29
LOL! I've never heard this joke before! How did you comeup with it so fast? Witty guy!
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:15:50
It don't make no sense on how/who to send money to when you go there.
