$1 is still ludicrous. BTC is a fiat currency. You can knock the USD, but the only advantage that BTC has over USD is that it can't be inflated at will so it retains any value that you ascribe to it. But it doesn't have inherent value - you ascribe value to it.
If you want something I have and I say BTC is worth nothing, you have to go and convert your BTC into something that I will accept as payment. It'll be a long time before this universally acceptable means of payment is not the USD (or another local currency, depending upon your location).
There's still a real possibility that at some point somebody high profile will stop accepting BTC and then somebody else will say "it's worthless, it's only a string of ones and zeroes" and the whole currency will collapse.
Then you can go try and convert your BTC and nobody will convert it for you.
And BTC is PURE fiat with nothing backing it. At least USD has a promise to pay - how much that promise is worth is debatable but it is worth at least as much as the lack of a promise with BTC.
If you want to hold BTC in your portfolio you should consider it just like any other currency.
The future of cryptocurrency requires something that is both non-inflatable and asset-backed. Until then, cryptocurrencies will come and go just like traditional currencies. The big question for me is what asset can back a currency. Gold? Nah. We've all been brainwashed into thinking it is valuable but it is not. You can't do much with it except make jewelry, and in a recession people don't want jewelry and so gold is less appealing. The right asset shouldn't be subject to whims and fads.
