Overstock told me to contact "the bitcoin" for my refund so apparently it is a company or entity and not a computer software

Yeah. Visa charges us $60 to take a credit card on a $2,000 unit of our product. Pretty sure it would only be that high at worse case scenarios with btc

Considering the majority of buying is coming from korea/japan, why do us future contracts make any difference?

Currently many people want to romanticize the profits of bitcoin whereas the ones who understand the software see it as a new form of legitimate currency the world could adopt (whether they get rich from it or not).
I want a world where cryptocurrencies have stable value. It doesn't make sense to me why we value gold to back currency when we could use math.

If you believe that you need to sell all.

Taxes are absolutely necessary and i hope blockchain makes everything more accountable and transparent. 
Taxes may be too high but they gotta be high to build our massive infrastructure.  They may not be high enough...esp the capital gains rates on big investors.

Specific reasons why?
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:47:38
When using segwit my fees are only a few dollars per transaction...still way too high but better than the $10 it was before.

What is KYC?
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:37:18
It isnt really anyone in particular.  The capitalist system has to work this way around fiat. Unemployment goes down, prices go up to attract new help, inflation rises, rates go up, more money gets produced.
Pretty sure that is how it works. Seems like if things were based on a single crypto or maybe many cryptos the result would be the same except the currency would be deflationary. Not sure.

What is BAKKT?
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:10:09
Yeah, he/she was def oversimplifying it. Some people might mean thousands of people when they say few.
