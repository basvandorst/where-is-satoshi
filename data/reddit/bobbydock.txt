I find it sad that people are saying "it's not taking off because Wall Street isn't on board". It just shows how pathetically small the real economy actually is: nothing can happen without the blessing of Wall Street. And THAT my friends is the last stage of serfdom.

Then that's what I'm saying. If you need to exchange your bitcoins for US dollars to buy a headphone, then you might as well sell your bitcoins now because fiat is a superior form of money.

Here's why:
1) governments are going to regulate the shit out of btc&lt;-&gt;fiat exchanges. Soon you will have to send a coloscopy before you can open an account on Coinbase. Ecommerce will suffer none of that. This is why it's not such a bad idea to have an exchange that piggybacks on the ecommerce infrastructure as opposed to the banking infrastructure. 
2) now when you receive bitcoins you can be confident that you can use it to buy anything you want with them through this service (although it is not the only method, I agree)
3) what if you are part of the "other 6 billion" people that are unbanked? How can you buy a headphone on Amazon if you don't have a bank account?

I think it does. If you know that you can pay your rent with it, you can now earn your income in Bitcoin and stay in Bitcoin (without having to convert to fiat to pay your rent). And THAT my friend is good for the currency's wider adoption.

Congratulations Leah, you are the alpha-dog of the week.

If you don't see the point of buying things with Bitcoin, then why would you want to own Bitcoin in the first place? After all US dollars can buy you anything, right?
If you think that the only useful function of Bitcoin is to be exchanged for fiat, then you might as well sell all your bitcoins now because they will crash.

Crazy! How did you do that?
