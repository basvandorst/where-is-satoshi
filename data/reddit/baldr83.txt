8.7% administrative expenses and near perfect ratings by charity ratings group doesn't seem like the "worst charity org to exist ever."

If you want to read this on the web-
Google: "Chinese Investors Buying Up Bitcoin as Yuan Falls"
(same article, different title. linking directly leads to a login but a referral from google should make it free to read)

But they could say: "I signed an NDA and though I can't talk about anything that is related to it, I do not think Wright is Satoshi." I doubt that would violate the NDA. Unless the NDA is insanely restrictive and prevents the signer from even giving any opinion related to Wright. Can't know for sure unless we've seen it I guess.

That's absurd and this isn't "getting serious." What's Satoshi going to do? Sign a new document every time a new hoax pops up? No.
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:52:52
Which leads credence to the idea that Andresen was either tricked (due to cognitive bias) or convinced (in order to collude with the hoax) to publicly back Wright's claim.

The BBC headline yesterday was originally "Craig Wright Revealed as Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto"

Except he didn't do that. He provided clearly faked evidence (that was based on entirely public information but misrepresented as proof). and in December he back-dated blog posts to trick news outlets.

If that happened, I guarantee that CW would wipe his blog again and put up a post saying that the transaction was him proving his identity.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:19:48
thanks for proving my point (?)

I've never heard of an NDA that restricts you from saying you've signed an NDA. NSLs are a different matter. Perhaps would be willing to publicly publish the NDA so we can see how restrictive it is.
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:25:42
Is that a joke or an actual theory?
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:59:51
In the records he links to in that quote, it shows that either Matonis or Andresen put .11 bitcoin into the address used in the first ever transaction (12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S). and another .11 into the genesis block. Weird.

Andresen should give a more thorough recollection of the London verification process so that we can figure out how Wright tricked him.
Sentences like this do not look good:


@_date: 2016-05-05 16:03:12


He didn't do this. There was an email. But it wasn't signed.
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:09:41
Didn't he go through the trouble to back-date posts and trick wired in this article[1]?
And didn't he go through the trouble of flying Andresen to London to trick him?
And didn't he spend time writing (and screenshoting) a tutorial on how to prove that he is Satoshi? Which was later proven fake.
Seems he is willing to go to great lengths for his hoaxes.

Worse than terrible. The original headline they put up was "Craig Wright Revealed as Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto"
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:40:00
Mainstream media (BBC et al) loves reporting on people instead of topics/math. People are easier to quote and photograph. Furthermore, there really isn't a "big impact" by who Satoshi really is, but the secrecy and drama drives clicks.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:10:13
I didn't say that it can't. I just said I've never heard of one that does. We would know for sure if we saw the NDA (as I wrote above).
