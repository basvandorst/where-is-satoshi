Well, a lengthy, thoughtful post of mine about the seriousness of this issue was just simply deleted by someone.  Thanks, mods...?   Now I can't find any evidence of me having posted it.  Something fishy here...  Gotta love reddit =/.  And now it is telling me I've been a "Redditor for 2 days" lol...?  This account is almost a year old.

I Love BetterTouchTool, I've used it for years!  Only way to get awesome custom gestures on Mac OS, among other things.  Maybe one day I'll get a MBP with a Touch Bar ;)

Not to mention that this issue strikes at the very heart of the concerns about centralized exchanges.  If Binance (and all other centralized exchanges) don't rectify this, and other issues like it, as quickly, cleanly, and responsibly as possible, with utmost integrity, it will mark the true beginning of the end for the centralized exchanges due to further erosion of trust.  People already know centralized exchanges aren't a great idea when it comes to crypto, but there just aren't many options out there right now, usually due to the lack of volume on those decentralized exchanges (at least for traders / speculators).  This type of issue is a crucial watermark for the industry and will be scrutinized more in the future by the crypto community.  In this case, with great *trust* (from all your users) comes great responsibility, Jager, and CZ.  I suspect CZ knows this, but it is time to put your money where your mouth is.  Literally.

Very interesting, thank you for sharing!

Bingo.  This hits the nail on the head.
Jager unequivocally failed at customer service here.  CZ needs to have a serious chat with him to fix this, for Binance's sake.  This is where the rubber mets the road; will Binance step up and demonstrate the credibility, responsibility, and integrity they claim to have and so prolifically tweet about?
