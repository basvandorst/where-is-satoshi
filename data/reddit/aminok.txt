I don't know how many times I'm going to have to explain this.
I'm saying that a certain percentage of Bitcoin-QT users, like all Bitcoin users, drop Bitcoin altogether every year. This is the churn in Bitcoin users I was referring to. People lose interest in Bitcoin for all sorts of reasons.
To keep the number of Bitcoin-QT users constant, a certain percentage of new Bitcoin users have to pick up Bitcoin-QT. When that percentage goes down, due to a change in what's recommended to new Bitcoin users, that will lead to the loss rate of Bitcoin-QT outpacing the gain rate, and a net loss in Bitcoin-QT users over time.

They don't have to all be rich. As the number of users increases, the number of rich users will increase as well, as there is some likelihood of any new user being rich. Even if 1% of Bitcoin users are rich, and only half of them want to run a full node, that will be hundreds of thousands of full node operators with a network that has 100 million users.

We don't need to scale to hundreds of megabytes per block now. What we need is a way to get to hundreds of megabytes over time, without changing the plane's engine while it's in flight. The scaling mechanism should be defined in the protocol, and not require a synchronised software upgrade by all users.

Not true. Widespread agreement can exist alongside controversy, if there is a vocal minority. One loud person, who constantly complains, shouldn't be able to veto a change that 99 want, by defining the criteria for stopping a change as 'presence of controversy'. Bitcoin is open source and free to join/leave and fork. People are fully entitled to fork the project, and anyone who wants to, can join them. You can't force people to respect your imagined veto power.

The only party that has full control over digital USD is the Federal Reserve. Digital USD sits in FR maintained accounts, and is governed by the FR's rules. USD holdings outside of the FR system are in fact credit that is redeemable in USD, so inherit whatever inefficiencies the latter has. The FR is a large, inefficient, bureaucratic institution, so it's not going to compete with Bitcoin on cost.

And I think making a limit that allows millions of Americans to run a full node on their home PC, rather than say, millions of Bangladeshis on their mobile phones, is arbitrary. Why not make the requirement millions of Japanese and Koreans, who have much faster internet? Leave Americans and their home internet out just as we currently leave out those in the developing work with their mobile internet. What matters is that millions of people be able to run a full node: not that they live in a particular country.

No they don't. 
They can build an empty block on top of the header, before validation is finished. An empty block is okay, because it means there are no transactions that might have been invalidated by txs in the previous block. When validation is finished, they can start building a block with txs.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:24:28
So it's port forwarding that is the main barrier to running a full node, not bandwidth or storage, in which case, the block size's centralizing effect is a Red Herring.

Minus the implication that it's only Blockstream developers that are conservative about changing the 1 MB limit, I concur entirely. This is really an issue of the integrity of Bitcoin's core properties.
LN txs are not, as Back claims, Bitcoin txs. They are guaranteed by a Bitcoin tx, but that is different from being actual Bitcoin txs that are immutably recorded in the decentralised timestamp server.
I think there is a reasonably high chance that LN txs will make up the majority of BTC-denominated txs, but for Bitcoin to remain true to its original vision, Bitcoin txs must remain cheap enough for ordinary people to use for every-day txs should they choose to.

I don't want to speculate. I can only tell you that the dramatic drop in the full node count happened after much of the community decided that Bitcoin-QT, the full node client, should not be recommended to new users, and most significantly, the most trafficked Bitcoin website in the world, bitcoin.org, stopped recommending it exclusively and providing an installation link on the landing page. 
During the phase when the full node count was growing, the blockchain was also growing. What was different was that Bitcoin-QT was almost exclusively recommended to new users (in large part because for much of that period, there were no other reliable clients).

@_date: 2015-06-15 19:41:12




This is incorrect. The estimation of &gt;300,000 full nodes was as a result of a looser standard for counting full nodes:


Estimates on the actual full node count in early 2013 range from 30,000 to 80,000.
Furthermore, the notion that it was larger blocks that contributed to most of the drop in the number of full nodes is NOT supported by the facts.
Copying/pasting from an earlier comment I made:
Recommending of Bitcoin-QT to new Bitcoin users became a faux pas in early 2013. It was claimed that regular people should download and install an SPV client like Multibit.
Predictably, there was a large drop in the full node count, as the wallet market became dominated by a large number of new, light clients, and the most trafficked Bitcoin website, bitcoin.org, stopped exclusively recommending people to install Bitcoin-QT.
Some evidence that Bitcoin-QT stopped being recommended as strongly early 2013:
Up until at least March 18, 2013, the only client recommended to visitors of bitcoin.org was Bitcoin-QT, and an installation link for it was provided right on the landing page:
The WayBack Machine shows that by March 25th, 2013, this had changed, and a 'Choose Your Wallet' button appeared on Bitcoin.org/:
From March 25th 2013 onward, the number of non-full-node wallets recommended by bitcoin.org increased, in response to a general increase in the number of high quality and/or well marketed light and mobile wallets on the market. 
Now a days, Bitcoin-QT is one of twelve clients displayed on bitcoin.org's Choose Your Wallet page:
Other than Bitcoin-QT and Bitcoin Armory, all of them are non-full-node clients.
This shift, from a wallet market where only Bitcoin-QT was available and recommended to one that is increasingly diverse and dominated by light clients, coincides with the point (Spring 2013) where we start seeing a decline in the full node count.

Most people support the hard fork. Every single poll done on the matter has shown an overwhelming majority support it. I believe Gavin when he says that the majority of major companies in the Bitcoin space also support raising the limit.

@_date: 2015-06-19 20:11:38
Any hard fork that raises the limit at this stage (when the Bitcoin community has millions of members) will be controversial, and further more, all hard forks are disruptive. For that reason, it's better to opt for the more controversial, but more durable hard fork, that obviates the need for future disruptive/controversial hard forks on the protocol's block size limit.

This is very much unappreciated by the analyses found in the ML. I understand that the anti-fork developers don't want Bitcoin to break, and for that reason are being conservative and looking at worst case scenarios, but there are massive potential benefits in defining Bitcoin's scalability schedule right in the protocol, in the form of major economic interests investing in the Bitcoin economy, and consequently, much larger flows of real world resources being invested in core infrastructure development, that can help meet the challenges of scaling. 
Their concern about theoretical centralization risks from worst-case bandwidth growth and end-user-behavior projections (not to mention community governance projections, which assume that the limit growth rate can't be soft-forked down if it's found to be too high) is disproportionately large relative to their concern over the risk of incurring a massive opportunity cost in not seizing the potentially tens of billions of dollars worth of investment into the software ecosystem because Bitcoin was not made adoption friendly.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:57:47


 
I strongly doubt that Blockstream's developers are doing any of this due to a conflicting financial interest. I think they genuinely believe that Bitcoin is better off with legitimate tx volume throttled, because they believe it will prevent a dangerous level of centralization.

The difference is that SMTP servers generally hold the private information of end users. In an SVP - full node configuration, the SPV, under the control of the end user, holds ALL of the private data, while the full node holds publicly available data that can be found in thousands of other places.
What's sad is that some people are not recognising that forcing Bitcoin users off the blockchain onto centralized settlement services, by limiting block space, is much more dangerous with respect to encouraging centralization, than forcing Bitcoin users to poll any number of full nodes for **public** blockchain data.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:17:58


Digital data transfer and storage is cheap. Every larger-than-micro tx in the world could in fact be sent to 10,000-100,000 nodes, especially in any plausible scenario, where it would take at least 20 years to reach that volume.

This sounds like an excellent plan, minus the part where an inflexible static limit is used to create a fee market, when other tools are available.

Even if it doesn't work out fully, and we only see half the gains projected, running a full node by 2036, in a scenario where blocks are full, wouldn't be dangerously expensive. And it's capped from 2036 onward, so progress that happens after that point will only improve full node accessibility. It's only a matter of waiting. But for what it's worth, I'm pretty optimistic about the progress in computing performance. I don't think we're anywhere close to the physical limits of performance.

Nope: "dictating consensus" is a meaningless term. Consensus is voluntary, and no one can dictate it. If someone wants to run the fork Hearn is promoting, they will, and if they don't want to, they won't. There's no dictation involved.
"XT Fork might ignore the longest chain" is a musing he made about what the community would do if a malicious mining coop ignored what the community as a whole wanted. In that case, the &gt;50% security model would have failed, and Mike was offering backup measures.

The original purpose of the 1 MB limit was to prevent DOS attacks, and it was intended to be raised as the total size of legitimate txs approached 1 MB per 10 minutes. If the 1 MBers want to turn Bitcoin into a lightweight network that only large banks can afford to write to, they need to get consensus from the community to change Bitcoin's vision.
@_date: 2015-06-21 03:07:47
Maybe my understanding of mining is far removed from the reality of it, but from what I understand, that ship has long sailed and larger mining pools have an enormous advantage over small ones for reasons totally unrelated to the bandwidth costs, and the situation would not change in any appreciable way if pools suddenly needed 5 MB/s of bandwidth due to larger blocks.
With implementation of Meni Rosenfeld's Multi-PPS scheme:
And IBLT-like propagation, the major advantages of large mining pools would disappear. But these initiatives require resources to get completed, and that is something that adoption and a larger Bitcoin economy can aid.
I go back to my point: 167 KB/s tx is not going to make the Bitcoin network fragile to the point of being censorable. It's a global network, and there are tens of thousands of people with an interest in keeping it censorship free. There would be millions of people with an interest in keeping it censorship free if the Bitcoin economy was large enough to sustain 3,000 tps.
As for Sybil attacks: as long as your internet connection hasn't been hijacked, it's simply not going to happen in a 167 KB/s world. You only need to connect to one honest node - and yes, there will be at least one you can connect to at that throughput, to know the correct chain.

Go back to This has nothing to do with accepting his statements as truth. It's about showing what Bitcoin was defined as when it started. If others don't like what Bitcoin was designed to be, they need to convince the community to change their vision for the network, not the other way around.

Lightning Network might not work as well as promised. Bitcoin shouldn't have to wait until every conceivable off-chain scaling solution is tested in the real world before being allowed to finally scale in the simplest way possible, by raising the arbitrary 1 MB per block limit.
And the hard fork should change the limit to one that either automatically decreases/increases based on blockchain properties, or is a predetermined schedule. The limit shouldn't have to be changed through a hard fork every few years, subject to an acromonious political debate/struggle between various factions. The Bitcoin protocol was created precisely so that this kind of political jockeying would play no role in the core properties of money. By leaving future limit increases dependent on hard forks, as Adam Back is advocating, it guarantees the exact opposite in Bitcoin's future.

@_date: 2015-06-14 14:29:31
That's absolutely delusional.
Bitcoin processes 100,000 txs per day right now. That's as many txs as occur globally in one second. With a 1 MB limit, that number can increase no more than 3X. 
With respect to "layers on top": they also require on-chain txs to work. Even if the Lightning Network turns out to be a perfect substitute for every type of tx done on-chain, 1 MB would limit the number of Bitcoin users to less than 1 percent of the world's population. And that's an extremely optimistic estimate that assumes 1 channel per person is adequate for privacy.
So the only way Bitcoin could be used by the world with a 1 MB limit is if it becomes a settlement network for banks, while the common man relies on those banks as their intermediaries. In other words, no p2p future.

A maximum cap in the rate of block size growth provides more protection against rapid growth that could diminish full node accessibility. The dual limit approach is balanced and highly conservative.

@_date: 2015-06-01 10:51:56
Yes, that would give the network a little breathing room over the next couple of years to go through a long overdue growth spurt, but limiting growth to 15% per year thereafter would accept the notion that everyone should be able to run a full node, which is I think an overly stringent requirement that costs too much write access to the blockchain to justify.

I thought you were talking about for the merchant. For the average consumer, you're right. The merchant needs to pass on some savings in the form of discounts for it to make sense. However, that will only come in time, when (if) it makes up a noticeable part of a company's revenues, so that merchants have a reason to optimize their Bitcoin policy to maximize revenue from it. To get there, Bitcoin needs a lot more users, which goes back to my original point, that rapid growth should be main focus right now, not worrying about how a few hundred geeks won't be able to run a full node through Tor if network traffic increases.

I actually don't care what Satoshi thought. What I care about is the purpose that the lead developers gave for putting the 1 MB in place when it was put in place. The purpose was as a temporary anti-spam measure, to be raised when the average block size approached it, and not as a tool to throttle legitimate (non dust/spam) tx volume. It just so happens that Satoshi was the lead developer at the time.

No one was forced to implement multisig. Making on chain txs too expensive for retail purchases would mean forcing major Bitcoin companies to completely change their services. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:02:36
I do apply the same logic to 20 MB blocks, but it's still 20X more than 1 MB, meaning that instead of, for example, 0.1% of the population being able to use Bitcoin, it'll be 2%, which is a significant difference.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:38:08
It's assuming certain things about the future, like an emergency hard fork being possible in a short period of time, that adoption will not be harmed by the lack of definition of what the Bitcoin protocol will look like in the future, and that hard fork to change the limit will not get more difficult and risky as time goes on.
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:37:25
C is very much optional. We control it, independently of max block size. If we're willing to stall adoption in the name of decentralisation, wouldn't it make more sense to go back to recommending people run full nodes, before we tell the entire market that Bitcoin will be forced to wait for on-the-drawing-board ideas like Lightning Network to become reality, before it can (maybe) be use at scale in a p2p fashion?
As it happened, it was burdensome to run a full node before March 2013, and was getting more so with every block, yet the full node was increasing, along with adoption. 
The new availability of reliable light clients I estimate played a bigger role in the decision to stop recommending a full node client to new users than the increase in the size of the blockchain from 2012 to 2013.
@_date: 2015-06-12 21:09:56
That is suspiciously well-produced for a video created in 2013, long before the debate became intense.
Anyway, the original purpose of the 1 MB limit was to prevent DOS attacks, and was intended to be raised as the total size of legitimate txs approached 1 MB per 10 minutes. If the 1 MBers want to turn Bitcoin into a lightweight network that only large banks can afford to write to, they need to get consensus from the community to change Bitcoin's vision.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:40:40
That much leeway could be used to justify anything, including changing the 21M BTC cap. If the purpose of the 1 MB limit was to limit the number of non-spam txs that are confirmed in a block, a consensus should have been reached that this is how Bitcoin should behave, before it was implemented.

Throwaway account telling Bitcoiners that it doesn't matter how high fees get, Bitcoin adoption cannot possibly suffer, and altchains cannot possibly compete with it. 
Why don't you use your real account instead of a throwaway you created today?
And your little summary of a currency's qualities conveniently leaves out 'cost of usage'. $1 per transaction eliminates one of the major advantages of using Bitcoin: low fee transactions, and opens a major space for competing altchains to fragment the market.


Which is a bizarre thing to believe for a supposed Bitcoin advocate. Bitcoin is at a very very early stage in its life. It should easily be able to grow on an exponential curve at this phase. Other network effect technologies like the internet, and social network sites, did. Saturation isn't even in sight at this point.


If you want to make it easy for governments to attack Bitcoin, you will keep it small and irrelevant, by obstructing the effort to do a scalability hard fork, so that the public has no stake in the network, and does not protest when laws are proposed to ban its unrestricted use.

It's only undervalued if the current hard limit is changed through a successful hard fork. Otherwise, competing altchains without the same design goal of prioritizing read-access over write-access stand a chance to fragment and devalue the cryptocurrency market or displace the blockchain as the market standard chain for recording p2p electronic tx records in. Fortunately, the dev community seems to be seriously looking at several options, including some smart adaptive solutions, to replace the 1 MB limit with.

In what way was I disingenuous? That's right: "sorry, you can't afford to run a node.

Bitcoin isn't supposed to be a socialist experiment in 'equality' and the '99%'. It's supposed to be a permissionless system where anyone with the necessary hardware can participate in. Currently that excludes hundreds of millions of people in places like Bangledash. Do you want to reduce the block size so they can all run a full node on their mobile phone too?
I would rather Bangledashis be able to create transactions with their own private keys, and submit them directly to the blockchain without going through a trusted third party intermediary, than Bangledashis be able to run a full node on their mobile phone, but not be able to afford to generate a tx that is recorded in the blockchain.

But it's not Gavin that's refusing to be collaborative. If you go on the Bitcoin IRC channel, you will see absolute disdain from a few individuals for majority will with regard to the block size limit, for any suggestion that Satoshi's vision for on-chain scaling is possible, and for any proposal for a hard fork at all. 
Gavin has come up against a brick wall for years.
I think that if Adam and a few other influential tech people got onboard with one of the hard fork proposals (which seems to be what's happening), we will likely see an amicable resolution to this. Tech people are starting to step up with more proposals, and that's encouraging. I just don't think Gavin and Mike are to blame for it having come to this point.

Assuming that future hard forks on the limit will be possible, and will not lead to the network splitting, is not conservative IMO. It's extremely dangerous. The sooner the hard fork is done, and the fewer hard forks are done, the greater the possibility that Bitcoin will not forever be stuck with a too low limit, and/or fail due to the network splitting due to a hard fork not having full support. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:38:24
Can't the hard fork introduce a mechanism into the protocol to allow the 32 MB cap to be lifted with the expressed consent of the economic majority (e.g. through a vote by stake, or Bitcoin Days Destroyed)? 
I just see leaving the 32 MB fixed cap in there as possibly setting up Bitcoin for another hard fork crisis years down the line, when the community would be many times larger, and therefore the consensus would be even harder to achieve. Anyway, a 32 MB maximum cap is so much better than 1 MB, or the risk of the network splitting in a hard fork that doesn't have consensus, that I would support the current proposal regardless of this shortcoming.

Exactly. The key, in my opinion, is to ensure the economy of Bitcoin is getting larger in proportion to increases in average block size, so that the decentralising effect of wider adoption counteracts the centralizing effect of higher full node operating costs. The focus should therefore be on creating a mechanism that ensures blocks are filled with data representing real world value and not low-value spam.

It makes that conclusion right in the section called "conclusion".


It can handle it now, but the proposal is for the block limit to reach 8 GB by 2036. There ARE also counter-forces at play, like default reference client behaviour, in particular transaction priority and non-relay of dust transactions.
I think it would be better if an additional counter force was introduced at the protocol level. The elastic and flexible cap proposals would satisfy this need IMO, by introduced an economic cost for a miner to nudge the dynamic block size limit up.


A large Bitcoin with adoption levels 20X today's levels would have a much larger network effect than it has even today, and would face no competition from an altchain with barely any users and a maximum on-chain throughout of 12 tps.

While I agree that the technical community doesn't have some special insight that makes them more qualified to make economic policy, and that the insistence by some technical people to stick to a 1 MB is tantamount to trying to impose economic policy, and should cease, I don't think comparing them to "climate change deniers" is helpful.

With all due respect to these major contributors, they don't have any special political or economic expertise, by virtue of their familiarity with the Bitcoin software, that makes them exceptionally qualified to determine how the block size will affect the full node count, what the optimal trade off is between direct full node validation access and direct block chain write-access, and what level of full node decentralisation will keep Bitcoin sufficiently censorship resistant.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:52:05


It really depends on multiple factors. For example, if the block size increasing is as a result of the Bitcoin economy getting larger (as opposed to the same amount of economic activity taking place but blocks filled with dust txs coming up against the 8 or 20 MB limit), then in fact the higher limit makes this attack much more expensive.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:59:20
This assumes there will be no O(1) propagation scheme implemented. Even without O(1) propagation, there are ways to get around the latency caused by larger blocks. For example, one pool has started mining on the header of a new block immediately, trying to generate an empty block (as they don't know what transactions were in the previous block to know which txs they can accept in the new block as valid), and then starts working on a block with txs after they've finished validating the previous block.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:49:52


7 billion people each making 3 txs a day would mean the ave block size would be 72 GB, which would require a broadband connection of 121 MB/s U/D to run a full node.
At that point, the Bitcoin network would be processing more txs than the current total transaction volume of the entire world, meaning there would be tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people/companies with a major economic stake in the network, and economic incentive to run a full node capable of validating it. Remember, it would only require a 121 MB/s connection, which isn't that much considering this network would be more economically significant than all major financial institutions and central banks combined.
The average person on their home PC wouldn't be able to run a fully validating node, but the network would be far too decentralized to censor, because nodes would be distributed all over the world. It doesn't really matter if they're anonymous or not. As long as they can be anywhere, nothing short of a global ban on Bitcoin would stop the network.
 &gt;It's a ladder that would be climbed. It makes no sense for the US to start doing deals in a currency with a global market cap of $3b. But it does make sense for smaller entities (corporations, remittances, etc.).
Exactly, and to get to the lower rungs of the ladder you're referencing (corporations, remittance), the rungs below it have to use Bitcoin, meaning the common man. Liquidity is the key.

With all due respect, you're absolutely wrong that there wasn't a social contract for the 1 MB limit when it was first put in place.
The purpose of the 1 MB limit was to prevent DoS attacks through bloating of the blockchain by malicious rogue miners. Mike Hearn talks about this here:










You will not find other developers who were around at the time disputing this.
All discussions about the 1 MB limit near the time when it was first instated assumed it would be increased to provide enough capacity for legitimate tx data as the average block size approached it. For example, Satoshi's comment in 2010:


    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
      maxblocksize = largerlimit




Other comments by lead developers before and shortly after the 1 MB limit were put in place clearly show that it was intended to be a temporary anti-spam control, and NOT a tool to implement an economic policy of throttling 'legitimate' (representing transfers of non-negligible real world value) tx data, for example:


Changing the purpose of the limit from spam control to implementation of an economic policy to throttle legitimate tx data, is a change of the social contract, and requires consensus. 
Right or wrong (and I think it's right), absent consensus to change the purpose of the 1 MB hard limit from a temporary anti-spam control, the block size limit should be raised to comply with the social contract.
@_date: 2015-06-19 08:33:43


And Bitcoin is almost free too, so altchains cannot compete. Things could change if fees for BTC txs were $1 or more. This is obvious, and the fact that you're trying to convince people otherwise, while using a throwaway account, smells.
So why are you using a throwaway account anyway? 


Millions of Americans can use cash without showing ID to their merchant, because they have grown accustomed to it, and would not put up with laws to abridge their right to do so. Digital cash needs to do the same thing, and achieve mass adoption and public buy in for its use peer-to-peer use, to gain the same kind of security from political attack. 
If cash were introduced in 2015 instead of 1815, and had taken 50 years to reach mass adoption, there's a real possibility by the time it was in common use, there would be laws in place barring its use in purely peer-to-peer transactions.

I agree completely but the 1 MB limit is a property that from the beginning, when it was first implemented, was meant to be changed as soon as the block size began to approach it. It was an anti-DOS measure. To try to turn it into a tool to throttle legitimate transaction volume to maximize decentralization, no matter how good of an idea, is the change here, not sticking to the original plan. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:55:45
If I may make a couple of points:
1. You may be absolutely right about current usage being "incredibly wasteful". However, there could be major advantages for the ecosystem and long-term development of Bitcoin to allow it to scale, and allow adoption to accelerate now, with currently available technologies. Growing Bitcoin's liquidity, engineering mindshare, and VC funding, in the two or three years it may take for the Lightning Network and other trustless payment aggregation systems to become ready for mass-consumption, will only help make those technologies a reality sooner. Blockstream for example would never have been funded with $20 million if the 'inefficient' adoption of the last six years hadn't occurred. I see the current stage of adoption as a ladder, that helps Bitcoin get to the higher, more efficient stage that you think it should aim for. Raising the block size limit will not delay that better future. It will hasten its arrival. And if you believe that block space scarcity is essential for these off-chain solutions to come online, then why not propose an elastic block size cap that only increases when fee pressure increases..?
2. The Bitcoin community might not be convinced that waiting is the best course of action. Even if you're right, and the majority is wrong, consider that not compromising on this could lead to a dangerous split in the community. It might be best for all parties to compromise on their ideal vision for Bitcoin in order to achieve wide consensus.
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:33:32

That's a mischaracterization. He said that in unlikely hypothetical scenario where the vast majority of full nodes and Bitcoin users support the hard fork, while the majority of miners are opposing it, the Bitcoin community would use alternate means to authorize the valid chain that ignores the consensus breaking longest-chain.
There is no way this would happen of course (miner sentiment will undoubtedly reflect that of the general Bitcoin userbase), but leave it to you to take his response to a hypothetical scenario, mischaracterize it, and say that this is what he *WILL* do.

The Stone Money analogy was used to show how something with no non-monetary value can still have monetary value. Essentially, the consensus on who owned which stone allowed the stones to be used as currency, and their ownership transferred without moving the stones. Consensus was the source of value, like in Bitcoin. He has never said that Bitcoin ownership would be hard to transfer.

The blockchain is public information and is widely propagated. Even if someone doesn't run a full node themselves, they will quickly discover any malfeasance through third parties/word-of-mouth/etc. It's not like all of the block explorer services are going to collude to give the public a falsified record of the transaction history, and even if that somehow came to pass, it's not like they wouldn't be quickly exposed and discredited.
It's much more important, IMHO, that everyone have write-access, so that they can use their own **private keys** to generate txs.

I'm going to need more than your word to believe you.


The problem is hard forks themselves are potentially very risky, even if they should be uncontroversial. Better to do a more controversial hard fork and obviate the need for Bitcoin to have to do one again in a few years. It goes against Bitcoin's ethos to make a core aspect of the protocol dependent on a pseudo-centralized political consensus process. I strongly believe all future scaling processes should be defined in the protocol, so that they are predictable, just like the coin issuance curve and difficulty adjustment algorithm are.


You're suggesting you will be able to connect to more nodes with a 1.67 KB/s network than a 167 KB/s, and that this will affect the odds of a successful Sybil attacking being executed. I don't see how that could possibly be true. No one is going to connect to 500 or 1000 nodes in either scenario, so they're not going to run out of nodes to connect to.

It is the non-expert majority that holds power over what is included in particular articles. In the same way, the non-expert crowd would choose Gavin's proposals to Peter's.

The Wisdom of Crowds has been demonstrated in a diverse set of fields that involve complex issues that only specialists are well-versed in, to be superior to the estimates of experts.


Deep technical knowledge can enable one to produce accurate estimates on resource usage and metrics of network behavior, but one doesn't need to have the same level of technical knowledge to take those variables and draw conclusions from them. The conclusions are based on projections on how people will behave given those variables, and things like how technology will evolve, and that does not require knowledge of the finer details of a specialized field like the Bitcoin protocol.

Unless you've conducted a large, randomized poll, asking people is not going to give you a high degree of certainty about the cause of the full node count.

Starts at 8 MB. After twenty years, reaches a cap of 8 GB. Having a final cap allows Bitcoin to retain the option of aiming for maximal full node accessibility, since over time, any broadband growth rate that's above zero will allow the average home internet connection to catch up to a particular limit. With 8 GB blocks (which allow a maximum average throughput of 13.65 MB/s), and broadband data usage allowance growing at only 15% a year for example, within 35 years, it will be feasible for the average US home internet user to run a full node without exceeding their consumer grade data caps. One other advantage of this proposal: these are lucky numbers in China.
1 MB  per block, or 1.67 KB/s, doesn't cut it for a financial network that aims to serve the world, and leaving the future scalability process to unpredictable hard forks arrived at through messy political bickering, instead of defining it now, in the protocol, is not wise. This scalability schedule is what is needed to make sidechains, the Lightning Network, and Bitcoin as the 'internet of money', a reality.

Simply auditing the BTC holdings of a party is not all that useful, given the auditor needs to know the amount of credit issued to depositors, which it will not be privy to, to know if the service's debt is fully backed. Frankly, I think practically no regular person will run a fully validating node just so they can do some marginally useful audit of their service.
More important I think is to give people direct write access so that they do not need to trust their money to centralized services.


I'm having trouble understanding this perspective. Not having direct read access doesn't mean you will not know the state of the blockchain. It's public information that will be widely propagated and easily verified. There will be dozens of block explorer services to query. The odds of them all colluding to defraud you is so infinitesimal as to not be worth considering. The odds of a trusted third party not redeeming your credit for BTC is not negligible, and is what we will see if everyone doesn't have write-access.
Going a little bit out of order in responding to your comments here:


Isn't that impossible at some adoption levels? One of these three has to give: number of users, percentage of users with direct write access, percentage of users with direct read access.


So a hard fork every couple of years? Don't you think that centralizes Bitcoin too much, and subjects it to too many risks of network splits? Do you not see any harm from having the scalability issue constantly hanging over Bitcoin, and not resolved one way or another?
@_date: 2015-06-01 05:59:42


"Social contract" is abused when used in the context of justifying legal obligations thrust upon us by democratic majorities. The usage here is actually perfectly appropriate: the 1 MB limit was put in place, and accepted by the community, on the basis that it would be lifted as legitimate tx volume approached it. It was an informal agreement/understanding/contract.


Your interpretation that throttling legitimate tx volume bolsters decentralisation, and furthermore, that the availability of blockchain space to everyone in the world that may want to make use of it is a less integral part of Bitcoin's social contract than decentralisation, is widely disputed, and certainly doesn't trump the 'contract' (or if you prefer a term with less connotations of legal formality, the 'implied agreement'), that the 1 MB hard limit would be used only to prevent bloating of the blockchain with spam, and not to limit legitimate txs.
@_date: 2015-06-29 02:12:21
No one can predict the future. Any decision on the hard limit, including keeping it at the arbitrary 1 MB value, has risks. Doing once-every-couple-year hard forks to increase the limit a small amount at a time introduces the risk of one of these hard fork debates leading to a division within the Bitcoin community that leads to a split of Bitcoin into two currencies. It also has the risk of the Bitcoin economy paying a steep opportunity cost in lost adoption and investment from a lack of a clear/reliable (i.e. not dependent on the politics of hard forks) scalability schedule.

Bitcoin is vastly different from previous distributed decentralized protocols, so I'm not sure how relevant one's expertise in one of these protocols is to anticipating how the block size limit will affect Bitcoin's future prospects. I suppose it might give one better insight into how many full nodes the network needs to stay censorship free..?


And I would agree that we should defer to the computer scientists on issues of computer science, but unfortunately, there is an economic component to this debate, and it is this component that is contentious, and which I believe only the wisdom of crowds (the economic majority) is positioned to settle. That's not to say that more computer science analysis wouldn't help better inform the block size debate.

It also relies on being decentralized enough that it becomes politically infeasible to institute a global ban on unrestricted full nodes. What level of decentralisation makes it secure against political attack is not something that Bitcoin's tech community is going to be able to answer with "scientific analysis".

Limiting on-chain txs to a tiny subset of the global population is sacrificing the purpose of Bitcoin, which is to allow people to transmit money without trusted third party intermediaries, for the sake of ensuring 100 million people have real-time read-access, instead of 2 million people. In the best case scenario, a 1 MB per block limit (1.67 KB/s limit) would make Bitcoin the world's best decentralized cryptocurrency network, for big banks. In the most likely scenario, the momentum behind Bitcoin will be wasted, as interest fizzles out, and Bitcoin is eventually replaced by a blockchain without an arbitrary absurdly low limit on tx throughput capacity.

It's notable for what it does not contain: which is any reference to the limit keeping legitimate activity off of the blockchain, to keep the network decentralized, which the other quotes I provided from the lead developer corroborate (e.g. "The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.

I don't know what the determination that OP_RETURN and other tx data not representing non-stock-currency-transfers are 'inefficient' is based on. Efficiency can be determined by how much fees people are willing to pay to get the data recorded in the blockchain. The more fees people are willing to pay, the more value per byte that data has, and therefore the more efficient use of block space that is.
The Bitcoin protocol should be neutral to the type of data recorded in blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:51:08
Bitcoin has three option:
1. Stay at 1 MB per block (1.67 KB/s) forever. This is self-sabotage, and greatly diminishes Bitcoin's chances of success. It's grossly irresponsible and not a realistic option.
2. Have the developers make frequent, 'uncontroversial' hard forks, to raise the limit a small amount at a time. This would turn the Core developers into a sort of political overseer group of Bitcoin, since they would hold sway over a critical basic property of Bitcoin. The result would be a much less decentralised protocol that is much more vulnerable to political intrigue. It goes against what Bitcoin is supposed to be to have people actively manage something as essential to the protocol as the limit on block size.
3. Replace the static limit with a dynamic one, so that Bitcoin's current and future limit is defined in the protocol, like say, the present and future coin issuance curve or difficulty targeting, and not under the ongoing control of a technologal elite.
Option 3 is the only responsible one.

The non-'color' (categorization) data itself is nothing new. It shows that the block size limit is getting hit on an increasingly frequent basis, as the ave block size approaches it.

@_date: 2015-06-05 22:08:23
Centralizing write-access to decentralize read-access is a poor trade-off, since there are very secure alternatives to direct read-access, like polling multiple parties to ascertain the state of a tx, whereas limits on write-access necessitate trusting someone else to hold your BTC, rather than controlling it with your private key.

Yes I do believe that the potential exists for Bitcoin usage to increase due to virality and increasing utility as the network of users gets bigger. Bitcoin is in many ways better than physical cash and traditional electronic payments. It's not cumbersome to handle like the former, and it doesn't cost high fees to transfer like the latter. In the ways that Bitcoin is not better it can reduce its disadvantage by growing in users and usage.

Moderate scarcity of space that creates a fee market where you expend a modest $0.02 or $0.05 USD worth of BTC to create a transaction, will not harm adoption. It will aid it, as a result of the indirect positive benefits of a smaller blockchain.

Nations are not going to start doing business in Bitcoin with a 1 MB block size limit. For large institutions like national governments to adopt Bitcoin, it needs to already have massive liquidity, and that requires adoption by smaller parties first.


Bitcoin's strength is that it's a public ledger with public propagation of transactions and a method for authorizing blocks that is open to the world (DMMS). It will not break down just because the flow of data increases. I'm confident that its open nature will adapt to any setting, and route around any attempts at censorship. The only thing that can kill it, in my opinion, is a political climate that can justify banning end users (e.g. merchants) from using it, and competition, and it becomes more vulnerable to the latter if the blockchain is bloated with low-value spam, or if artificially throttles the volume of legitimate transactions with a too low block size limit.

Gold cannot be used in physical form for small denomination transactions, due to having TOO HIGH value density. So due to that reason, something like copper is not competing with it in that use-case, and therefore its value does not come at gold's expense.

You're acting the part of a troll and making efforts to misconstrue Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin, which he clearly laid out.
Again: start an altcoin that enforces the principles you claim Bitcoin needs to adhere to, because they're not Bitcoin's. Assuming &gt;50% of mining power is honest, and most users using SPV clients, is what Satoshi laid out for Bitcoin.

The full node count, the cost of running a full node, the risk of government censorship in various countries, and the political climate around Bitcoin, are not domains of knowledge that are limited to those with a high level of technical knowledge about the Bitcoin client. A core developer's opinion will obviously have more weight than that of a non-developer, and that is appropriate, but the voice of the community as a whole outside the developers, in the aggregate, matters more, by simple virtue of economic significance (hundreds of thousands of people with billions invested in the network and economy).

Wow this is a really good analysis.

Bitcoin has had five years to think of a better way to stop flooding - one that can discriminate between low value filler  txs and txs representing real world transfers of value. A hard limit on block size is a crude, inflexible way of stopping flooding and can be replaced by something better.

I agree that it may be better to go along with the fork with the violated 'social contract' for practical reasons (more dev support, maintaining harmony, etc), but I think it's worth arguing the principle that the plan to raise the hard limit when the ave block size approached it was the original vision for Bitcoin, and following through with it, absent a wide consensus not to, is more consistent with Bitcoin's ethos of consensus based change to the protocol.

He never said he would volunteer himself as any "central authority". It would be consensus based, and people would be free to recognize anyone's checkpoints as valid.


I disagree. Miners are major stakeholders in the Bitcoin economy, and it's unlikely that any hard fork proposal, other than one that would change the hashing algorithm, would harm them while benefiting everyone else. Thus far, Gavin says most pools support raising the block size limit, in line with majority sentiment.
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:47:26
It's a lock. Major mining pools not accepting RBF does in fact reduces a probability of a 0-conf double spend attack working. You're not admitting the security that it does give.
Anyway, the bigger problem is the attitude displayed by Peter Todd and others about who decides for whom:

Mike is one of the most valuable members of the Bitcoin community. He understands that projects can fail, not because of some theoretical threat like centralisation, or government censorship, but because people lose interest in them, and they are superseded by services that while technologically inferior (in theory), get a critical mass of adopters (Windows vs Linux on the Desktop would be a prime example).
Forcing the entire Bitcoin ecosystem to start over with new wallets that work with Stoerm, the Lightning Network, or some other protocol still in the early stages of development, and destroying hundreds of millions of dollars in investment into Bitcoin services that assume end users will be able to directly use the Bitcoin blockchain for every day transactions, by turning the 1 MB limit from a temporary anti-spam safeguard into a tool to impose a new economic policy of throttling the volume of legitimate txs, is how to reduce Bitcoin's chances of succeeding, and Mike is alert to this danger.

How about increase to 20 MB, with 40% annual growth, but on the soft limit, reduce to 500 kB, with 10% annual growth? The hard limit would then be a worst case scenario failsafe, that otherwise doesn't do much, while the soft limit becomes the main tool to control the block size. As the soft limit is more flexible, it will give the Bitcoin economy a greater ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

If there were demand to record 1 GB of legitimate txs in the blockchain every 10 minutes, and pay fees on each one of them, I believe the economy supporting the network would be exponentially larger than it is now, and would be able to support a large number of high-throughput full nodes distributed enough all over the world to make the network practically invulnerable to any attempt to censor it.

Point taken on the uncontroversiality of the soft forks, but I made two independent points: hard forks to change the protocol's block size limit policy will always be controversial (defining controversial as facing vociferous opposition from at least some influential quarters), and hard forks in general will always be disruptive. The track record with soft forks doesn't disprove that, since soft forks don't require every node to upgrade, and none of the ones to date have changed the protocol's block size limit.
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:31:38
Yes, because you control your own private keys. You can poll as many public sources of blockchain data as you want, until you're confident you're getting true data, and you never have to trust any of them to hold your BTC.


This can be addressed without resorting to a static protocol limit. For instance, an elastic or flex cap (proposed by Meni Rosenfeld and Gregory Maxwell, respectively) can be determined from some multiple of the average size of the last N blocks (proposed by Gavin, among others).
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:32:41
Whether Bitcoin should have 5,000 nodes of 100,000 nodes is not a technical question. It's a political one.
Bitcoin is not just a technical project. It is also an economic network, and its viability is dependent on the buy-in of the economic stakeholders. So no, the technical community should not be able to veto something that the greater community wants, and get to turn the 1 MB limit into a permanent throttle on the volume of legitimate transactions simply by refusing to agree to any hard fork proposal. If the community at large wants more on-chain transactions, and more on-chain transactions was part of the "original vision" of Bitcoin, they are fully within their rights to support a hard fork against the wishes of developers.
Hopefully there are enough reasonable people within and without the developer community for wide consensus on the block size limit to be reached.


Ah the irony.

This proposal doesn't kick the can down the road. It doubles every two years until 2036, at which point it will allow 8 GB blocks (13.33 MB/s of throughput), which, in combination with overlay protocols, should be enough to satisfy the world's needs.

15% is probably too conservative considering there will be exponential jumps in broadband availabiliity as fibre internet subscriptions become available all across the developed world. It also accepts the notion that Bitcoin should sacrifice write access in order to give everyone with an internet connection the ability to run a full node, which seems like a strange trade off to me, as I assume most individuals who do not have regular write access to the blockchain won't need to validate it.
Bitcoin is guaranteed to outgrow Tor if it achieves even a modicum of success, so I think the goal keeping it small enough for Tor should be abandoned. 


That really depends on whether you insist on everyone being able to run a full node, which I believe is not a rational objective to have given the trade-offs it requires be made.
With respect to this: 


You're equating vastly different degrees of relying on trust. Trusting a random sampling of full nodes, and the honesty of the mining majority creating the longest chain, because you don't have the ability to validate the blockchain yourself, is much less dangerous than trusting a single Trusted Third Party to hold your money, because you don't have write access to the blockchain.

Consensus is only defined as consensus among developers? Or stakeholders at large? What percentage of stakeholders need to support a change for it to be consensus in your opinion?
Gavin proposed 20 MB and then 50% per year increase after that. None of the other core developers agreed, and none provided a counter proposal other than 'wait and see' with the 1 MB limit.
He proposed 20 MB and then 40% per year increase after that. Again none of the developers agreed, and none provided a counter proposal.
He proposed 20 MB, with no exponential increase. Again, no agreement, no counter proposal, no willingness to compromise, despite all indications that the community at large wants to do a hard fork.
Gavin suggested that perhaps we could do 8 MB. Again, no counter proposal, no compromise.
Look, the developers owe the community nothing. They're working for free, making free software that makes Bitcoin, and by extension, the world, better. However, the community also has a right to move from their consensus if it deems it sub-optimal. Hopefully it won't come to that, and cooler heads will prevail, and reach some kind of mutually acceptable consensus.

There's no need to set Bitcoin up for another hard fork crisis in 5-10 years with a static hard cap, but I agree with that if this is what it takes to get consensus, let's do it.

I didn't know that. If true, that would be great.


If you want to use the same channels instead of constantly creating new ones, you have to use the same peers. On the blockchain, you can use a unique address for each transaction and connect to new peers each time, since no channel needs to be set up to a peer to propagate a tx to them.

Some do. I certainly don't. I think they want Bitcoin to scale, but feel scaling through allowing a greater volume of on-chain transactions comes at too high a cost. I disagree with their evaluation.
I also recognize and acknowledge that the Core developers have contributed much more to Bitcoin in general, and scaling in particular, than me. That doesn't mean that I will not express disagreement with them when I think they are wrong.


Or it could be that they have a different assessment of which trade-offs make Bitcoin more secure (e.g. high block size limit = greater adoption = larger economy = more public buy in making it more resistant to political attack + higher hashrate making it more resistant to &gt;50% attack = greater security than making it easier for end users to run full nodes).


Bitcoin's resource consumption is not O(n^2), as Mike Hearn explains: 


using economically reliant full nodes)
You're making an assumption that your assessment is correct. You could be wrong. The system may work fine with most people using SPV nodes. SPV nodes are certainly less secure for a user than a full node, but it doesn't necessarily follow from that the block size limit should not be raised. There many other factors at play.


I don't see where this assumption comes from. Just because someone wants a higher block size limit, doesn't mean they are not aware of layer 2 (offchain netting). I personally am very excited about layers built on top of the blockchain, like the Lightning Network, but don't want to put all of Bitcoin's scaling eggs in one basket, and also believe Bitcoin should stay true to its original vision and also (not mutually exclusive with overlay protocols like LN) allow millions of people to use the blockchain directly for txs, for the same reason that Bitcoin's coin supply should stay limited to 21 million: it's part of the original promise of Bitcoin and it diminishes the credibility of the currency when core design properties are changed.


This is just a presumption on your part. It doesn't follow that someone wanting a higher block size limit doesn't understand the LN and its security properties.

Do you see any merit in the argument that larger blocks can affect decentralization from the other direction, by increasing full node deployment through higher adoption?

We won't see it happening if there are other factors at work that work against the full node count, like the release of several high quality SPV clients, which occurred in 2013 and 2014. Since early 2014, adoption has slowed significantly, while more SPV and mobile wallets have continued to be released, so it's not surprising full node count hasn't increased.

I am very confident that 1 MB is holding back adoption, and it will indisputably hold back adoption when blocks fill up. With respect to the present, it holds back adoption because there is serious concern that Bitcoin cannot scale beyond the current 1.67 KB/s throughput limit. The 1 MB per block limit, and the potentially damaging hard fork to get rid of, hangs over the Bitcoin economy, and reduces investor/business confidence in the network. Individuals and companies investing in Bitcoin-related ventures, and marketing their Bitcoin-related services to consumers, is how adoption happens. Adoption isn't some constant that occurs in a vacuum. It's intimately tied to the direction the community is going in, the confidence within and outside the community in the future of the network, and the investments of time and money being made into the network as a result of these sentiments.

It wasn't JUST on the advice of bitcoin.org. It became a common belief that Bitcoin-QT should not be recommended to new users. Lack of full nodes was not a concern at the time, so sacrificing full nodes for user convenience was seen as a good trade-off.
But as it happens, bitcoin.org is the top search result for the term 'Bitcoin', and is probably the most credible Bitcoin site to a new user, so its change from recommending users to download and install the full node client, to giving them a dozen options, would have had a huge impact on what clients Bitcoin users run.

Gavin has not suggested that 8 GB blocks will mean "Bitcoin gets really centralized" and that node running machines "only fit a big data center". The latter is speculation on your part that is vigorously and convincingly disputed by proponents of Gavin's plan, including Gavin himself. 
Even if blocks were 8 GB today, you wouldn't need machines filling a "big data center" to run a full node, and under Gavin's plan, it would be 2036 at the earliest (when computing and broadband performance will undoubtedly be far better than today) when blocks get that large.

* A thousand fold increase in tx volume will result in total fee revenue exceeding current miner rewards several times over. The network's current transaction volume is miniscule, so a massive jump is not unreasonable to go after.

Welcome to Reddit!
The entire world will not switch to Coinbase/Circle tomorrow without larger blocks. Coinbase/Circle are indistinguishable from banks in a small block scenario. They only have value within a Bitcoin economy where users can make low-cost peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions, which again, requires larger blocks at higher levels of adoption.


The odds that Moore's Law would ceases wholesale tomorrow, and that by 2036, computers and connectivity have not progressed at all from where they are today, is much less likely than the risks that Bitcoin faces if it doesn't achieve mass adoption, like legislatures all around the world easily getting legislation passed to require businesses to report personal details about any party to a cryptocurrency transaction, or the mundate failure scenario, where Bitcoin simply has no global impact, and fails to achieve its great potential, because of a policy of artificially keeping blocks small.
Even in the scenario that computers and bandwidth barely improves in the 21 years, which I find to be extremely unrealistic, we would not "lose nearly all the full nodes". If blocks were really filling up with 8 GB of txs, the Bitcoin economy and userbase would be exponentially larger than they are today, and there would be many amongst this larger set of users that could afford the hardware and bandwidth to run a full node. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:11:46
A fee market helps reduce bloat, which increases the efficiency of the Bitcoin network. I don't think a static hard limit should be used to create such a fee market, but I do think some other mechanism that is able to create a slight amount of block space scarcity, to create a fee market where txs are paying at least $0.02-0.05 USD worth of BTC in fees, would be good.
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:52:59


Agreed, but that has nothing to do with percentage of users that run full nodes. That has to do with the absolute number of full nodes (i.e. the full node count) and the geographical distribution of those nodes. Both of these would undoubtedly increase under a mass adoption scenario.
tl;dr: The systemic risk of censorship does not require every Bitcoin user to run a full node. It only requires a sufficient number of full nodes to exist in enough places where eliminating the uncensored Bitcoin network becomes infeasible. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:45:40
The point I'm making is that the drop in full nodes after March 2013 shouldn't prompt us to artificially limit the volume of on-chain txs by keeping the 1 MB in place as the average size of blocks starts to come up against it.
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:10:21
You were the first person to sound the warning over the 1 MB limit:


It turned out you were quite prophetic.
Bitcoin will fork if it comes down to it, and Bitcoin XT will likely be the altcoin that wins.
The ability to fork is the advantage of open source over proprietary companies like Friendster. But forking will do damage to the reputation of cryptocurrency as a whole, and the chances of cryptocurrency becoming the new monetary standard, so the community should work together toward a consensus (although it gets difficult when the lead developer of the reference client says that change in the 1 MB limit would [go against Bitcoin's social contract]( and should never be done..).
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:07:14


Note that a block size limit increase does not necessarily lead to a block size increase. Also, even is a situation of the block size increase outpacing network technology gains, whether it will lead to full nodes declining depends on whether the blocks are being filled by economically valuable transactions or filler transactions. In the former case, the larger blocks will be associated with a larger economy, which can support a larger number of more resource-intensive full nodes.

It doesn't matter if he thinks a 1 MB limit doesn't have to remain in place forever. As long as he follows his philosophy, and he has veto power over forks, it WILL stay in place forever, because it's a trivial task for anyone of any degree of influence to make a limit raise proposal "remotely controversial", and someone in a community as large as Bitcoin's undoubtedly will to any conceivable proposal.

It's not an argument from authority though. If Satoshi reappeared today and said Bitcoin should become a 1 MB per block network that regular people only interact with through overlay protocols run by intermediaries, he would have to start an altcoin, because the vision declared for Bitcoin, and what everyone bought into originally, is larger than 1 MB blocks allowing hundreds of thousands of people to use at a time.
In the same way, changing Bitcoin's coin supply from the 21 million limit would be a betrayal of Bitcoin's founding principles, even if Satoshi requests it.

It's not in practice though. GBT is not widely adopted. If it is, then ASIC owners don't have to run full nodes themselves to avoid mining being centralized in the hands of pool operators, since they could outsource block creation from any full node.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:14:08


Dynamic doesn't have to be 'miner controlled'. It can be scheduled like Gavin Andresen's proposal. And even miner controlled can have economic incentives to make increasing the block size limit costly to miners, and thus very difficult to game.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:47:22
Routing in the LN requires creating a CJDNS like IP addressing system. A reputation system needs to be created as well. The need to have always on tx signing nodes for routing is an entirely different paradigm from current Bitcoin network operation (not to mention recipients having to be able to ~~sign txs in real time to receive payments, and~~ close the channel in time to settle their payments). I imagine all of this means it will be orders of magnitude more complex to implement than something like IBLT. Of course I could be wrong. You probably know much more about both than me.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:08:39


The problem is, many in the technical community have been advocating a wait and see approach for years now, despite efforts by Gavin to engage them in a discussion to find a long-term solution on the hard limit, and their recent proposals have included 'increase the hard limit to 2 MB', in other words, continuing to kick the can a couple years at a time, thus guaranteeing that the uncertainty of impeding hard forks will stay in Bitcoin's future indefinitely. I say that the limit should be dealt with one final time, and be defined forever in the protocol, just like the coin issuance curve. Maybe zero inflation and a 21 million coin supply is not optimal, but it's worth defining it permanently at these values, so that we don't have to wonder how it might change in the future.
I hope that the recent stirrings about hard fork proposals coming from other core developers materialize into something. It would be great if this discussion ramped up and progress was made toward a consensus on a durable solution to the limit.
@_date: 2015-06-24 08:30:36
A miner with an optimized FPGA at the time (this was when mining was still done with CPUs) could have created a large proportion of blocks, and made them the maximum size, and increased the adjustable limit in that way. It was the rogue miner creating giant blocks filled with spam, that the 1 MB limit was created to thwart. It was not, from what I gather from old forum posts that I've read, meant to throttle the volume of legitimate txs.

Welcome to Reddit!


I responded to this point when this guy made the exact same argument with his other throwaway account here:


@_date: 2015-06-08 22:13:01
1&gt; His analysis assumes the following:


But there is no objective reason to classify OP_RETURN, and more generally, tx data not representing stock-currency-transfers, as 'inefficient' use of block space. 
The only objective standard for determining efficiency of block space use is how much fees people are willing to pay to get the data recorded in the blockchain. The higher the fees people are willing to pay relative to the size of the tx, the more value per byte that data has, and therefore the more efficient use of block space that is.
The Bitcoin protocol should be neutral to the type of data recorded in blocks and LukeJr's analysis doesn't accept that. 
2&gt; Inefficient use of block space would largely vanish with a dynamic limit with an elastic block size cap, (unless we accept Luke-Jr's subjective definition of 'inefficient').  But given Luke-Jr assumes with absolute confidence that the 95% drop in full node count over the last couple of years was due to the blockchain getting bigger, rather than high quality light and/or mobile wallets becoming available as alternatives to Bitcoin-QT, he would oppose a higher block size limit regardless.

Controversial hard forks are dangerous. There is a real possibility that they could result in the Bitcoin network splitting. It's best if this is the last hard limit hard fork ever done. Even 20 MB likely won't be enough to eliminate the need for a subsequent hard fork, but at least it's enough so that if the community fails to ever raise the limit again, it gives the network capacity to have at least some significance in global commerce (especially when it leverages aggregation protocols like the LN).
Ideally, the core devs would all agree that the 1 MB limit needs to be replaced as soon as reasonably possible, and come up with a solution that automatically adjusts the limit to achieve the dual goals of discouraging frivolous/low-value txs, and providing adequate space for legitimate ones.
@_date: 2015-06-22 09:48:46
This assumes:
* The Lightning Network will substitute for all on-chain txs.
* You only need one channel person. What about privacy? Routing all of your txs through a handful of channels that you have with a handful of peers seems pretty terrible for privacy.

But now we have the lead developer of Bitcoin Core (the reference implementation) saying any hard fork to remove the temporary 1 MB limit would go against Bitcoin's "social contract", and other influential technical people insisting that any hard fork that risks causing people to stop running a full node is unacceptable and contrary to Bitcoin's vision.

That's my interpretation from reading the old forum posts. e.g.






It's clear that at the time when the limit was first put in place, there was no belief that it would be used to keep legitimate tx volume low enough so that users with average computers/bandwidth could run full nodes. Instead it seems to be have been seen by the lead developers at the time as a band-aid solution to protect against the threat of a rogue miner conducting a DOS attack via generation of large blocks filled with spam. All of the comments and posts about the limit and Bitcoin's future scaling corroborate this explanation for the limit's original purpose.
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:03:37

That wouldn't have been significantly different had the blockchain growth rate been reduced by 70%. Either way, it would be extremely resource hungry and slow to sync up relative to an SPV client, and therefore the latter would have been recommended in almost every case in both scenarios.
Why would you recommend to your co-worker to download a 5 GB blockchain (in a small block size universe) on their desktop to get started with Bitcoin when they can install a light client on their mobile phone? 5 GB or 40 GB doesn't change this equation much.

Mike Hearn effectively refuted Voskuil's argument:

I trust Hearn and Satoshi's judgment more than Peter Todd's. I don't agree with Hearn that there should be no block size limit at all, and that assurance contracts will secure the network, but I think Gavin Andresen's proposal is much more conservative than that, and could be supported.

@_date: 2015-06-22 20:20:28
Any decision risks future hard forks. IMO, this reduces the odds of a future hard fork more than almost an other proposal. Ideally, IMO, there would be a dual limit, one that adjusts according to the average of the last 144 blocks, with miners able to create larger-than-average blocks by paying more in an elastic block size cap scheme (see Meni Rosenfeld and Gregory Maxwell's proposals), and Gavin's proposed predictable limit, and the lower of the two would be chosen. It would be nice as it would create fee pressure, and would have a maximum cap in growth to stay conservative. But that's complex, and it's hard enough to get support for a single proposal, so I'm happy enough with this.

With larger blocks, there is still a profit motive for off-main-chain scaling solutions, because there is obviously some limit to how much data can be shared globally, and when that limit is reached, everything else will have to go off-chain.
Now consider, when at the limit, if it is a high limit, and Bitcoin's adoption has grown exponentially (imagine 100 million people using it daily), there will much larger profit motive for developing off-
chain solutions than if the limit is reached at 1 MB and 100,000 daily users.
A larger Bitcoin economy is immeasurably better for the state of Bitcoin's development. Just compare Bitcoin now to when it was still a hobby of a few hundreds people. It is not because of greater block space scarcity now compared to then that now Blockstream is able to raise $21 million for core infrastructure development while then, this would have been utterly impossible. Size, number of users, and amount of capital invested in Bitcoin, matters. It matters so much that it would be pure folly to not aggressively pursue a strategy of encouraging rapid adoption.


I know what you're getting at - Bitcoin's decentralization is its value proposition, so Bitcoin can't scale to thousands of tps without losing what makes it valuable.
I would say on the first point, you're right, but on the second, I'd argue that even if Bitcoin becomes less decentralized at 3,000 tps, it would still be orders of magnitude more decentralized than Visa and PayPal (and that's a big 'IF'). In fact, I don't see any possibility of Bitcoin coming under a global censorship ban, no matter which one of the block limit proposals is adopted, and a pretty strong argument that 3,000 tps and larger blocks are overall a more resistent network to censorship than 3 tps, despite the latter having the advantage of allowing nodes to be run through Tor.

This would suggest Gavin's original 40% (or actually 50% at first) proposal to be more in line with home connection speed growth. And even this proposal already accepts the assumption that everyone should be able to run a full node at larger scales, which was not a starting assumption of Bitcoin's.
15 or 20% per year would be leaving a lot on the table, and accepting a new validation-heavy vision for Bitcoin that artificially limits write-access, but it might be the only way to get consensus.

gmaxwell informed me that this particular variation of the idea (linear increase of difficulty target with block size) will not work, as miners will always be incentivized to create the lowest difficulty block possible, as it provides more fees relative to probability of finding a block, and therefore a higher expected payout.
A variation that I believe would work, but is more complex, is to allow users to attach PoW to txs, and allow blocks to meet their difficulty target with the combined PoW of the txs hashes and block hash.

Bitcoin has the added constraint of only having value if it's decentralized enough to remain censorship free, but I don't think we're anywhere near the level of centralization of full nodes that a global ban on full nodes or mining pools becomes feasible, or that it's even been demonstrated that higher tx throughput necessarily reduces full node count (as a counter example: full nodes increased from 2009 to 2012, despite block sizes increasing in that same period).

First of all, I wouldn't go as far as to blame this on the block size limit. I would however say that providing the market with a clear plan for scaling, by defining the process of scaling in the protocol rather than leaving it dependent on risky hard forks, would help boost confidence and adoption, and reduce problems like this.


Again, I wouldn't say that this is because of the limit. But an argument could be made that as the block size gets closer to the limit, without moves toward consensus on a hard fork, the vision of Bitcoin processing thousands of transactions per second becomes dimmer, and the people, companies and investors pushing for merchant adoption, and supporting existing BTC-accepting merchants, lose confidence, and become less willing to invest themselves further in the retail payment processing space.

@_date: 2015-06-01 11:17:56
Totally guessing here, but I think the other core devs would agree to 15-20% per year increase. If this were the hard fork agreed to, we'd have to resign to the fact that Bitcoin will not be able to match Visa's tx throughput any time in the next 30 years, just so that hundreds of millions of people without write access to the blockchain can validate it. Gavin's earlier proposal was 40% per year (brought down from 50%), which is more in line with Bitcoin's average annual tx throughput growth rate, and which would allow the Bitcoin network to far exceed the Visa network's tps rate within 20 years, but he couldn't reach a consensus with the other developers on implementing it.

At 20 MB of txs per 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network would be a major global economic network, and therefore I don't think it's an unreasonable trade-off to ask users to make if they want to be fully participating validating nodes. At some point, Bitcoin needs to start increasing the hardware requirements for running a full node. It can't scale and remain affordable for the typical American internet user, just like it can't be even modestly relevant if it were to accommodate the hardware and internet connection speeds of a typical Bangledashi. The fact that millions can use Bitcoin every day for substantial commerce (with full 20 MB blocks), and typical internet users in the US could still have 80 GB left over on their consumer broadband data usage quota, is actually impressive to me.


Yeah I suppose that would work. If people are able to make partial contributions of broadband, many more people will be able to contribute, and that will result in more full node decentralization in the aggregate.

If the average block is filled with 16 GB of txs (32 million txs, or 53,000 txs per second (half the global tx throughput)) in 2036, Bitcoin will have an economy able to sustain millions of nodes that store 3 PB of data. Bitcoin would be absolutely HUGE at that point (maybe larger than all central banks and banks of the world combined), AND data storage is going to get a lot cheaper by 2036, so I'm not at all concerned about it.
The key question is if the larger blocks represent real world economic activity or are simply spam/filler. I think as long as blocks can be limited to recording data representing transfers of real value, then large blocks will not adversely affect the resiliency of the network, because they will be associated with a larger economy supporting the network.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:45:40


Exactly! The limit was never intended to be anything but a failsafe to prevent malicious and/or greedy miners from bloating the block chain by generating spam/dust filled blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:52:17
More adoption now, enabled by conventional scaling, will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin's engineering mindshare growing, and further investments into its core infrastructures being made.
You're making the very poor assumption that the same adoption and growth that led to $21 million being invested in Blockstream won't, if it continues, lead to further infrastructure investments. Bitcoin has more resources being spent now towards making it more efficient than it did in 2009, when it was getting started, because it's an economically more significant network. Similarly, we can expect a larger future Bitcoin economy to attract more resources for the development of overlay protocols than it does now.
In other words, you're wrong to promote stunting adoption now with a limited space policy as a means to accelerate the development of overlay protocols. Adoption is precisely why Bitcoin has so much more resources being invested in all of its layers now than it did in 2009 when it had so few users.
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:21:48
The people who invested in Blockstream and are working for it are likely heavily invested in BTC, so it would be financially rewarding for them if these technologies were deployed and enhanced the Bitcoin economy.

Propagating a 500 byte tx to 10,000 full nodes is the same whether there are 3 tps, or 3,000 tps. The cost is not going to go up at a given full node count. The necessity for the full node count to go up with the size of the userbase is the assumption made when arguing that Bitcoin gets exponentially more expensive as it scales, and is not the only possible vision for Bitcoin..

@_date: 2015-06-12 22:13:33
I think a basic consumer broadband subscription letting someone run a full node with 80 GB left over is pretty good. It's an extremely fair trade-off in terms of the raising of barriers to read access, for the increase in maximum tx throughout (20X increase from current limit, to a maximum capacity allowing economy 40X larger than current size, without reducing end-user write-access).

Tx volumes have increased 8 fold over a span of a year in the past. Why artificially restrain adoption, at such an early phase in Bitcoin's life?

75% voting for it means 25% didn't vote for it, not 25% opposing it. Easily half of those could have not voted for it out of laziness, which would mean 75% to 12.5% supporting it, or supporting hashing power outsizing opposing hashing power by a factor of six, with &gt;85% of those with an opinion in support. That is more than enough to ensure the Bitcoin main chain continues to be a single dominant chain. 
I wouldn't object however to the threshold being upped to 80%. I just don't think it's a big deal either way, given that a lot of those who don't vote for it will not be against it. If a plan actually manages to spur 75% of hashing power to actively vote, that indicates huge support for it.

Disagree. 
1&gt; This issue deals with a lot of subjective factors, like the 'vision' people have for Bitcoin. There is also a truck load of guesswork/conjecture involved in any analysis around the optimal block size limit. All of this ambiguity means that it's more possible for a small, ill-informed minority to strongly oppose a limit increase that from the ultimate objective standpoint (whatever that is), is sensible and needed. In fact, given the ambiguity in determinations of optimal block size, it's very much possible that this minority can plant enough seeds of doubt in enough members of the technical community that a majority end up opposing it. 
I'll use a hypothetical example that is partly based on real events:
* A slew of light of wallets is released due to a technical innovation unrelated to changes in full node operating costs and the block size. At the same time, a policy change by the owners of bitcoin.org, brought about by factors largely unrelated to changes in the size of the blockchain, leads to the site going from recommending only the full node Bitcoin client, to recommending a dozen clients, most of which are light clients.
* This leads to a rapid decrease in full node count, as users switch to these light wallets.
* Some developers take the decrease in full node count as a sign that the increases in block size is causing a rapid degradation in Bitcoin's decentralization. Even as the average block size reach 1 MB, they oppose increases in the limit.
* A media event, say a movie prominently featuring Bitcoin, occurs, which draws many new people to Bitcoin. Blocks are now full however, so fees skyrocket, and most people looking to use Bitcoin realize that it's not the low cost payment network that they had heard about. They're not interested in paying $2 to send internet funny money around, no matter how decentralized it is.
* Block increase advocates plead for the development community to increase the limit, but now the Lightning Network is close to deployment, and the radical anti-increase minority are agitating against it, and threatening to split the network if the community proceeds with a hard fork. Conservative members of the development community are swayed enough by the twin appeal of avoiding a hard fork war and the promise of the Lightning Network, and oppose the hard fork.
* The Lightning Network is finally deployed, but has a major unforeseen shortcoming, that will take several more years of development to fix. At this point, Bitcoin's adoption has stalled for two years, as an altchain has begun to siphon users from it.
* Eventually, a hard fork is released a year later, when it becomes obvious that the Lightning Network can only substitute for a fraction of current Bitcoin use cases. At this point, the cryptocurrency market has fragmented into several competing chains. The public is turned off and confused by the proliferation of Bitcoin clones. By now, legislation is being proposed to require merchants to report personal details about the sender in every cryptocurrency transaction. The public, which doesn't use cryptocurrency, doesn't object, so it's an easy work of lobbying to get it passed. 
* With competing cryptocurrency standards confusing the market, and legislation stifling Bitcoin use firmly in place, the public begins to adopt a centralized and monitored 'cryptocurrency' en masse. This ends up becoming the 'Windows' to Bitcoin's Linux. Bitcoin, despite its technological advantages, cannot overcome the network effect of this new giant, and the world is stuck with a shoddy proprietary network for the next two decades, until the next technological paradigm shift gives us a chance to break out. 
2&gt; Any well-funded adversary can use a hard fork event to create crisis within the Bitcoin community, by paying agents, undercover as Bitcoin developers, to vociferously argue against any hard limit increase proposal, with warnings of doom. 
Ultimately, Bitcoin's scalability should not be dependent on the sanity, rationality and friendliness of a ruling elite of developers. Frequent hard forks, largely decided upon by the development community, completely conflicts with Bitcoin's ethos. 


Fair point, but I don't think this is a major threat. There would need to be an extremely low number of nodes for a 'attack all honest nodes in the network to do a Sybil attack' to be feasible.
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:04:51
1. A minority of 25% of miners will be able to stop a limit increase. It's unlikely that over 75% of mining power will support a limit increase if it's not in the economic interest of Bitcoin. 
2. Bitcoin users can always use a fork of Bitcoin if miners begin acting against their interests.

That doesn't allow you to secure the chain with the Bitcoin block chain's proof of work. An attacker can make an alternate chain, notarize its blockhash in the Bitcoin blockchain, while hiding the chain, and then release the chain to orphan the one the public saw first.


So it'll have a limited impact on the world if it's permanently throttled at 1 MB per 10 minutes (1.67 KB/s). Notice also that you're already moving the goalposts, from claiming a permanent 1 MB limit makes no difference, to claiming it does, but that it doesn't matter if Bitcoin can't achieve global adoption levels.

In practice, developers control the reigns in hard fork debates, since they write the actual code that the exchanges and full ndoes vote on. They also hold sway over sites like bitcoin.org which acts as the go-to site for new users of Bitcoin looking to download a wallet. The control Core developers have over the center of gravity in the Bitcoin software world has a snowballing effect that magnifies their influence. It's not impossible to overcome their collective preference in a hard fork debate, but it is difficult and risky.


Yes, but the core devs who decide on that cap are themselves bound to it. Having the ability to change it at any arbitrary point in the future gives them much more power than if they choose one algorithm and are stuck with it forever.
It's like the difference between having the coin issuance curve until 2140 defined in the protocol from the very beginning, and having it decided through bi-annual hard forks, where developers debate economic policy and then try to optimize the amount of coins generated to maximize economic growth. The latter opens up a huge avenue for corruption, abuse of insider information, etc.

The reason block sizes are limited is to prevent a rogue malicious miner from creating giant blocks filled with spam/dust, according to the lead developer at the time when he implemented it.

"Social contract" is abused when used in the context of justifying legal obligations thrust upon us by democratic majorities. The usage here is actually perfectly appropriate: the 1 MB limit was put in place, and accepted by the community, on the basis that it would be lifted as legitimate tx volume approached it. It was an informal agreement/understanding/contract.


Your interpretation that throttling legitimate tx volume bolsters decentralisation, and furthermore, that the availability of blockchain space to everyone in the world that may want to make use of it is a less integral part of Bitcoin's social contract than decentralisation, is widely disputed, and certainly doesn't trump the 'contract' (or if you prefer a term with less connotations of legal formality, the 'implied agreement'), that the 1 MB hard limit would be used only to prevent bloating of the blockchain with spam, and not to limit legitimate txs.

It depends on how you define decentralization. Right now 5,000 out of 7,000,000,000 people run full nodes. With a larger Bitcoin economy, that ratio could be 100,000 out of 7,000,000,000, which could be defined as much more decentralized, even while the percentage of regular Bitcoin users that run full nodes declines.
I personally think the key is have a mechanism that encourages blocks to be filled with economically valuable transactions rather than filler transactions. In the former case, the larger blocks will be associated with a larger economy, which can support a larger number of more resource-intensive full nodes, and thus will counteract the centralizing (node reducing) effect of higher full node operation costs.

If the other miners keep building blocks of the same size, then the relative effect of those empty blocks the malicious miner produces will decline, as the other miners' blocks drift to the opposite side of T from 0, and continue getting further from it, in the opposite direction of 0, as T declines. And even this temporary effect doesn't happen if instead of a straight mean, a trimmed mean or median is used.

The debate is over whether hard fork advocates are trying to 'change' Bitcoin. The fact is that the original plan, that had wide  consensus, was that the 1 MB would be changed before it could throttle the volume of legitimate txs. Not lifting the limit as block sizes approach it is the change, and it's change that doesn't have anywhere close to consensus. This is an entirely separate issue from whether limiting the volume of legitimate txs to maximise decentralisation is a good idea. I am not debating that at the moment.

Yes they can. Right now the maximum average tx throughput is 1.67 KB/s. It could slowly, over three or four decades, increase to 170 MB/s, and still allow a dispersed enough distribution of full nodes to be decentralized, while providing enough capacity for each man, woman and child on Earth to make 8 txs per day.

The cost is exactly the same for an attacker. 


Let's say it's 10X that throughput: 1.67 MB/s. With an economy commensurate with 3000 tps supporting the network, there would not be a dangerous level of centralisation in my opinion. There would be a large number of full nodes with the potential to increase further if there is a crisis.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:10:35


I didn't suggest that.


It's abundantly clear that the limit was not put in place with the understanding that it would one day throttle the volume of legitimate transactions. Maybe at some block sizes, it is a good idea to throttle legitimate txs, to prevent centralisation. Gavin's proposed hard fork certainly assumes that. But it's worth pointing out that that was not the express original purpose of the limit. Insulting me is not going to change that fact.

I don't see how larger nodes will prevent it from surviving as an underground currency, unless there is a global ban on Bitcoin, in which case, there is nothing stopping the global conspiracy from doing a &gt;50% attack on the network (and in which case, a larger network with more users is more secure than an 'underground' network with few users and low miner revenue).

That doesn't mean that the drop wouldn't have happened with a smaller blockchain. The blockchain is always going to take *some* space, and therefore in comparison, light clients will always be more attractive to most users. I'm just surprised that you seem so sure about the cause in the drop in the number of full nodes, when there are so many other explanations other than 'block chain got bigger'.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:01:49
The security of the Bitcoin ledger comes from the ability of anyone in the world to weigh in on chain authorisation, without any trusted third party intermediaries, and the incentive the block reward provides for them to do that. A permissioned blockchain does not have this accessibility or decentralized incentive scheme, so it is reliant on a central governing structure that can be attacked and coerced, to authorise the chain.

Controversial hard forks are dangerous. There is a real possibility that they could result in the Bitcoin network splitting. It's best if this is the last hard limit hard fork ever done. Even 20 MB likely won't be enough to eliminate the need for a subsequent hard fork, but at least it's enough so that if the community fails to ever raise the limit again, it gives the network capacity to have at least some significance in global commerce (especially when it leverages aggregation protocols like the LN).
Ideally, the core devs would all agree that the 1 MB limit needs to be replaced as soon as reasonably possible, and come up with a solution that automatically adjusts the limit to achieve the dual goals of discouraging frivolous/low-value txs, and providing adequate space for legitimate ones.

I don't think the sense of urgency in the community at large is due to the warnings of a crisis when blocks start filling up. I think it has more to do with the sense that Bitcoin has to grow quickly, to not lose its momentum. Businesses that adopt Bitcoin and see only a trickle of sales eventually drop it as a payment option. New cryptocurrencies also emerge that could replace Bitcoin as the market leader before it's solidified its position with a large network effect, or worse fragment the market and create competing standards and effective coin supply inflation.
Most importantly of all, the technology has gotten the attention of governments, which move slowly, but inevitably look to restrict people's access to technology in order to retain their control over economic processes. Mass adoption, which leads to public buy-in, is the best defense against the passing of laws to restrict digital currency technology, and the sooner it happens, the less likely it is we will live in a future where basic digital currency interactions will require permission-from/reporting-to some government agency.
It's been five years now, and the 1 MB limit is still in place. It's way too early in Bitcoin's life to be proposing it stall its adoption for the sake of running a block space scarcity experiment, using a dangerously inflexible hard limit, so there's no justification for the community dragging its feet on finding an alternative to the current limit. In conclusion, I see the resistance to doing something soon as missing the big picture and the urgency advocated as entirely justified.

A currency that is not useful for trade in contraband is not a useful currency. It would mean that the currency has no cash form. The fact that Bitcoin is used in less than legitimate markets shows that, fortunately, Bitcoin is type of electronic cash. This is a good thing even if it hurts Bitcoin's image. Asking black markets to use another electronic cash is like asking criminals who were making use of the internet in the 1990s to use another internet.
The way Bitcoin improves its image is that its usage in other areas becomes so much more prevalent that the actors making use of it for illegal markets become insignificant in comparison, just like what happened with the internet, and the only change that needs to happen for this to occur, IMO, is the 1 MB being replaced in a hard fork to a new mechanism for controlling bloat, like a new hard limit, that allows it to scale to mass adoption levels.

@_date: 2015-06-21 01:29:53
The crux of the issue is that you think white lists and other types of controls become possible with 3,000 tps, while I don't. 3,000 tps is 100 MB blocks (167 KB/s of tx throughput). That is not a network with some obscene hardware/bandwidth requirements for running a full node that limit full node distribution to a few data centers in a handful of countries. In fact, when the larger economy enabled by 3,000 tps is factored in, the distribution of full nodes, and the network's resistance to censorship, may be much greater.


Gavin's proposal is 8 MB block size limit, and then 40% increase every year thereafter. It's not immediately increasing the limit to 100 MB. With both the advantages derived from adoption and the risks of centralisation in mind, this is a baby step compromise proposal. And look, Gavin is willing to further compromise. He already went down from 20 MB to 8 MB. At least meet him half way in a counter proposal. Suggest 30% per year, until the limit reaches the 8 GB final cap in ~28 years. Or find other means, beyond a static protocol limit, to create a fee market. An elastic block size cap for example.

As I argued to a frequent hard fork advocate: "Bitcoin's scalability should not be dependent on the sanity, rationality and friendliness of a ruling elite of developers. Frequent hard forks, largely decided upon by the development community, completely conflicts with Bitcoin's ethos.":
It would be like if coin issuance was decided upon by frequent hard forks, instead of defined in the protocol until 2140. Look, we don't know how many coins the economy needs, or what the optimal inflation rate is. But it's important that's defined in the protocol, and not decided upon through periodic political debates. Bitcoin should be an automated, publicly defined protocol, not a committee run centralized currency.

At an exponential growth rate (which is any constant rate of growth) the last 50% will fill much faster than the first 50%.
For instance, if it started at 10 KB a block, and quadrupled every year, it would take three years to get to the first 640 KB, and six months to get to the next 640 KB.

It's much easier to soft-fork the limit increase rate down, if it's found to be too high, than hard-fork up.
Some of the mailing list correspondents seem to totally disregard the risk of hard forks. Not having a consensus around the limit increase schedule is leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to a major crisis in the future.
The Bitcoin protocol exists so that politics doesn't determine core properties of money. By leaving future limit increases dependent on hard forks, it guarantees the exact opposite in Bitcoin's future.

What if number of users increases, the percentage and absolute number of users with write-access increases, and the percentage of users with read-access decreases, while the absolute number increases? Why wouldn't this be a tolerable situation? Even if a lower percentage of Bitcoin users have read-access, it's possible for the absolute number to increase substantially if the number of users increases substantially. 
Why wouldn't this be a preferable situation to making Bitcoin less widely available, where it has less of a chance of ever reaching critical mass and permanently reshaping global finance?


I think there is a real possibility that the hard fork to change the 1 MB hard limit will be the last one Bitcoin ever does. Hard forks get much harder as the community gets larger. I think it's even more likely that it's the last highly contentious hard fork ever done, as those are especially sensitive to community size.
@_date: 2015-06-29 08:38:03
Short term this is a good solution, but long term, every year that we put off the hard fork that implements a permanent solution, the more painful that hard fork will be. The other track, of continually kicking the can down instead of eventually settling on an automated/permanent hard limit increase schedule, will get more risky as time goes on, as the community gets larger, and arriving at a contentious free consensus on even small increase in the hard limit gets more difficult. Any can kick solution also comes with a potentially significant opportunity cost from lost adoption/investment into the Bitcoin ecosystem on account of the risk of contentious hard forks hanging over Bitcoin's future and reducing the confidence the market has in its long term prospects.

They don't have to build larger blocks just because the limit is higher, and when others build larger blocks they can start building an empty block on top of the header until they've validated the entire block, at which point they can switch to building a block with txs, as F2Pool is doing.
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:56:55


If their estimate is wrong by a couple orders of magnitude, the 8 GB per block limit in 2036 proposed by Gavin would be just enough.
And as pointed out by it's much easier to soft-fork the limit increase rate down, if it's found to be too high, than hard-fork up, if it's found to be too low. Gavin's proposal is very conservative, and reasonable. You guys should all get behind it.

Sidechains are not as secure as main chain, and never can be.


At the very least, the original plan calls for scaling Bitcoin through straight increases in on-chain tx volume, until it gets to Visa-scale volume, circa 2008. This should be the default plan, as it is the original plan. The original plan also does not assume a full nodes has to be attainable for an average internet user. Write-access takes far greater priority over read-access. These are indisputable points.

I understand it, and I don't think it's unreasonable for a Bitcoin full node that is validating 12 million new txs a day to take up 68% of a typical consumer grade internet subscription's data cap. Tens of millions of people being able to run a full node with full 20 MB blocks every 10 minutes, and still have 80 GB free for movies and other high-bandwidth activity, is not that bad!
Right now, Bangledashis cannot run a full node on their mobile phones (the most common computing device in that country), but millions of Americans can. With a larger average block size (say 100 MB every 10 minutes), it could be that one day many Americans cannot run a full node on their home internet connection, but that millions of Japanese and Koreans can. To claim that the typical American computer user needs to be able to *easily* run a full node is just an arbitrary standard of decentralization. tl;dr: 68% of the data cap with full 20 MB blocks is not that bad.

I realize that, but the point I'm making is that the trade-off you're promoting that Bitcoin makes is trading away adoption, for incentives, and adoption is a much bigger contributor to development of Bitcoin's various layers than incentives. The reason Bitcoin has so many more bright minds working on all of its layers now than in 2009 is because of the adoption, and the associated increase in public awareness (especially in tech circles) and price (which increases the amount of economic stakeholders invested in Bitcoin), that occurred since then.
The incentives that comes from increasing fee pressure don't come close to the benefits of adoption with respect to accelerating the development of protocols to increase the efficiency of Bitcoin usage.

I think the ardent block-size-conservatives like Luke-Jr are over-estimating the risks from increasing full node operating costs and greatly undervaluing adoption.

The blockchain can be rewritten and the coins issued can be reissued in the new chain to an attacker. The blockchain being distributed to all full nodes doesn't protect against that. The number of full nodes storing a copy of a chain doesn't give that chain authority. It's the amount of proof of work, or in the case of a PoS based currency, proof of stake.


I'm making very straightforward points here, that you're failing to comprehend. "External gauge" means something outside of the currency itself, that can be used to compare chains and determine which one should be chosen as the 'authentic' one. Proof of work is an external gauge, since it shows proof of real world resources having been expended. Proof of stake, since it depends on coins from within the currency, is not.


You're calling descriptive terms I'm using "random words", and not actually responding to my arguments.


I made very reasonable predictions. 


P2Pool is not made to be scalable right now. It is possible to create a version of P2Pool that is scalable, that could replace centralized pools altogether.


I already explained what would happen. Changing the pooled mining software to not give pool operators control over what block is mined is extremely simple, and that is the first thing that would be done if pools were targeted. The next is that P2Pool software would be worked on to make it scalable, until there is no need for centralized pools.

Normal people prefer the current global banking system because it has a huge network effect and numerous highly developed supporting products/services. If Bitcoin had a network of similar size and an ecosystem of compatible products/services as substantial and well developed, I'd argue people would hands down choose it.
As for the cost of mining relative to the market cap, this will go down as the block subsidy decreases. The decrease in the block subsidy will mean that the difficulty will not always scale with the total value of BTC, and I'd argue it doesn't need to. There will come a point where an attack will simply not be feasible by any party due to its cost, and after that point difficulty does not need to increase much with further increases in market capitalization for Bitcoin to remain secure.

Litecoin is too similar to Bitcoin to have a niche. For example, it has the same halving coin issuance every four years.
The only notable differences are a choice of a different hashing algorithm and a different block-time, neither of which makes it distinct from Bitcoin from a consumer's perspective in a POS situation.
Other altcoins could more legitimately make the case for being a 'silver to Bitcoin's gold' than Litecoin (even though the idea of Bitcoin needing a silver is silly), like Dogecoin, ever since the developers decided to make it generate new coins indefinitely, and Primecoin, which has an issuance curve that's dependent on difficulty rather than the height of the blockchain (and means that, like Dogecoin, its long-term supply is unlimited rather than capped like Bitcoin's). 
Dogecoin also has its meme-based community to differentiate it, while Primecoin has a totally different type of proof of work function in using a prime number chain search rather than a hashing algorithm.

Then why are some people, like Gavin and Rusty, looking into it? If we're going to assume that the LN will be worked out and deployed, we should assume the same of a block compression scheme like IBLT, for consistency sake.


The future is unknowable and any course of action, including maintaining the current block size, has risk. The risk from stasis comes from both the potential for technologically inferior competitors to gain market dominance (and this can happen, if you look at Windows vs Linux on the desktop), from the fact that legislatures continuously push to restrict people in ever more areas of economic activity, as a means of attaining more control. With respect to the latter, delaying mass adoption delays the wide public buy-in that reduces its likelihood.


You can poll just as many nodes whether there are 1,000 or 5,000, unless you actually run out of nodes (i.e. you poll all 1,000, and they are all dishonest), but there's no reason to assume a lower percentage of nodes would be honest in a higher throughput scenario.

Those who think Bitcoin mass-adoption can be forestalled forever with 1 MB block limits are not appreciating the political aspect of Bitcoin security, which is that public buy-in, which comes through adoption (and which is enabled by larger blocks), is a defence against political attacks on Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin is in a race against the clock against legislatures around the world which will continue to ban more and more types of business activity in the space without public push-back. 
Public buy in is much much more important for Bitcoin security than being able to run Bitcoin nodes through TOR so that the network can continue operating in the highly unlikely event that every country world bans it.
Mike Hearn appropriately calls the insistence on the "wait and see" approach to the block size limit as "despair inducing insanity".

But you're talking about the lowest grade home internet connection. If even in this category, a significant, albeit small, percentage of people would run a full node (the only cost is less data available for other application, which is a burden, but not THAT bad), there will a huge number of people with higher grade broadband subscriptions (data caps of 500+ GB / month) that will be able to run a full node relatively easily.


Yes exactly.

I think they want wide adoption of decentralised digital currency and are not motivated by greed to want to sabotage Bitcoin to benefit the overlay protocols they are working on. I think many of the Core development community have a bias for loss-avoidance at the expense of opportunity of gain, which deviates from Satoshi's philosophical outlook, which is that he was willing to take risks for potentially large returns. Most economic stakeholders signed up assuming Satoshi's more experimental philosophy would guide Bitcoin development, but many of the developers want to take Bitcoin in a different direction, and hence we see tension.

We can figure it out for ourselves, but we cannot get consensus when there are people obsessed with the idea of a permanent 1 MB limit, or think that Bitcoin ceases to be Bitcoin if they can't personally run a full node on their home connection. It's entirely predictable that in a community of hundreds of thousands of people, there will be diverging views on a major issue.

I agree that it may be better to go along with the fork with the violated 'social contract' for practical reasons (more dev support, maintaining harmony, etc), but I think it's worth arguing the principle that the plan to raise the hard limit when the ave block size approached it was the original vision for Bitcoin, and following through with it, absent a wide consensus not to, is more consistent with Bitcoin's ethos of consensus based change to the protocol.

Yes, that's a risk, and I acknowledge that. If Bitcoin gets anywhere near as centralized as PayPal, it will cease to be a permissionless currency network.
The other risk is that Bitcoin become essentially banned, with the type of impositions found in the 'Bitlicense' proposals. That becomes much harder to do when it has major economic stakeholders, with political influence. EDIT: An analogy, but a poor one: if the internet had taken a few decades to achieve mass adoption, perhaps operating a server would have become a licensed activity, preserved for large internet companies. Due to the huge number of people who run their own servers now, there is next to no possibility of that happening in any liberal democracy now.

5,000 nodes is not that decentralized. The main force holding back node decentralisation is not the cost of running one, it's the very small percentage of the world's population with an economic stake in the network and a need to directly write to the blockchain. You need a higher tx data throughput cap to improve the latter.

The 'majority of coins' means nothing when who has what coins is established by POS, which has no external gauge that votes can be judged against. It can only work with trusted parties, which means it doesn't create a distributed consensus.


Bitcoin could jettison them and still work. A pooled mining protocol that reserves voting power for hashing device owners, while only giving pools the power to distribute coins, would make pools a minimally important party in the Bitcoin ecosystem with no ability to attack the blockchain. P2Pool mining holds the potential to eliminate pooled mining altogether.
For those reasons, Bitcoin is not vulnerable. An attacker knows that an attack against any of Bitcoin's trusted parties would not bring the blockchain down, because Bitcoin can switch to a decentralized mining configuration easily. This is not the case with any PoS based currency, which cannot establish distributed consensus.

The banking industry is stuck with innumerable licences. That's why in the UK, until 2011, it had been 150 years since a new high street bank had been opened. The licensing makes market entry restricted to only well capitalised firms ready to make a large initial investment, which gives large banks a captive market and little incentive to innovate and improve the value they offer consumers.

Less transactions does not mean lower fees. Larger value transactions will increase the fees. SCs will massively increase the value of transactions on the MC, because they will turn the MC into a central hub connecting all the SCs to each other, and increase the value of bitcoin currency, because it would make bitcoins the universal currency of a massive SC ecosystem.
And in any case, lower fees from the MC does not mean lower fees for those mining on the MC. Merged-mining means that miners can secure the MC while earning fees from transactions on SCs. With every increase of fees from merged-mining, the security of the MC increases.

You can send gateway IOUs easily through Ripple right now because governments don't care about it. If it gained any kind of traction, it would be regulated, just like the current banking system, with all of its friction and cost. 
A pre-mined currency reliant on trusted nodes, and with a corporation pre-mining most of the currency, cannot become the basis of a global financial system. It's not open, trustless, or resistant to take-over by governments. 


Bitcoin can eliminate that. Having to trust mining pools is not inherent to a PoW-based distributed consensus protocol. It's only a flaw of implementation, and can be fixed. Ripple's consensus protocol on the other hand is inherently centralized and cannot be fixed.

I was under the impression that the 2013 crisis was resolved without a hard fork. I didn't know it was with. Would you qualify that hard fork as not disruptive? Or at least tolerably disruptive?
With regard to a 20 KB limit, the community would be much smaller if the maximum tx throughput was that low, so for that reason, I think it would be easier and less controversial to raise it. But if Bitcoin was as big as it is now, with 20 KB blocks, my feeling is that we would have a different standard of decentralisation, that would result in the same kind of opposition you see now to raising the 1 MB protocol limit, like allowing every smart phone to host a full node. We would have seen a major reduction in the full node count, as the wallet market went from Bitcoin-QT being the only option, to a dozen light client alternatives arising, which would have created the same concerns about the block size causing Bitcoin to become centralised. Anyway, you're right that none of this speculation is falsiable.

Gavin had lobbied the developers privately long before he made public statements on the matter. Some of the developers totally reject what the Bitcoin userbase and stakeholders want in the majority: which is a hard fork to deal with the 1 MB limit, instead of taking a "wait and see" approach to something that is essentially a giant question mark on the future of Bitcoin. The lead developer of Core has come and out and essentially said he will never support a change in the 1 MB limit. A fork of the codebase becomes inevitable under these kinds of uncompromising circumstances.
Gavin taking the issue "public", when Bitcoin is open source and not the exclusive property of the Core developers, is entirely appropriate.


The "nodes" he refers to in the second post include both full nodes and lite nodes, as that was the nomenclature he was using at the time. The shift from calling lite nodes, "SPV clients", happened after Satoshi departed the community.

They increase your mining revenue, however little, and if SCs ever take off (which is the only scenario where any of the scenarios you're concerned about would surface), they would increase your revenues significantly.
That can only have a positive effect on total mining revenues for Bitcoin miners, which, as we know, determines the economic resources dedicated to mining, and by extension, network security.

Sidechain functionality can be implemented via a soft fork. Mining incentives are increased with more transaction fees from merged mined sidechains, so I can't see any cause for concern here. If sidechains succeed, it will only mean more network security for Bitcoin, which is particularly important as the block reward continues to halve and Bitcoin miners need a new source of revenues to be incentivized to continue securing the blockchain.

Both Coinjoin and e-wallets make it impossible to link unspent transactions (utxo) to one identity.

Same goes for an e-wallet. No one knows who the withdrawals belong to.

With spent transaction pruning and SPV clients, you can get a decent level of trustless participation in Bitcoin with larger-than-1-MB blocks.


So you want Bitcoin to be an international wiring service that costs a $30 transaction fee to use? The little people are back to using trusted third parties?
Extreme decentralization is great, but only if people are able to make use of the blockchain. 420 transactions per minute for a global population of 7 billion is insufficient. It would mean the vast majority of the human population would never do a transaction on the block chain. If Bitcoin is going to be relevant, it without a doubt needs to raise the block size limit to allow more people to directly participate in the network. The costs of running a full node with transaction volumes of even 100 MB a block would still permit thousands to run full nodes, which is a wide enough distribution for Bitcoin to remain censor-proof.

Well at the moment almost all the ATMs are Bitcoin-only ATMs. There are a couple units that allow Litecoin exchange as well, but all the ones made by Lamassu and Robocoin (which are the majority of the ATMs around the world) do not.
Alternative Bitcoin-like currencies are not particularly useful for international remittance because they have a much lower market cap, and therefore higher price volatility, than bitcoin. By the time the alt-cryptocurrency reaches the destination and is sold, it could have lost 10% of its value. Bitcoin has this problem as well, just to a lesser extent, so it's a superior choice for large transfers of value.
I think it's better to not encourage the cryptocurrency market to become fragmented as well, because one large cryptocurrency is more useful than several medium sized ones. A common network simplifies the process of making transfers, because all value is transmitted through the same protocol. If you want to enjoy the lower volatility of a single widely held currency with several less widely held currencies, you need to create a basket, and transfer those. That adds all sorts of complexity. Communication protocols are one area where competing standards can actually impede adoption rather than accelerate it.

I think Bitcoin is actually safer from greed if core devs are paid a direct salary by a for-profit company for their work, rather than doing it pro bono, and then doing contract work on the side for for-profit companies. A direct salary is more honest, with potential avenues for a conflict of interest more visible to us all, letting us keep them accountable.

Another person spreading FUD? Use of sidechains would be 100% optional so no one would be "dragged into them" in anyway. Only those people who want to risk their coins on a sidechain would face any risk that they pose. Anyone who wants to stay with the Bitcoin blockchain would be free to do so, and would not be affected by what happens on sidechains in the least.
There is absolutely nothing economically or technically irresponsible about giving Bitcoin users the option to use new features on other blockchains without having to invest into altcoins. This optionality would be massively beneficial for the Bitcoin ecosystem, and would raise the likelihood of cryptocurrency as a whole maintaining the digital scarcity in currency units that's needed for it to succeed.

The difference is that in POS, anyone who doesn't turn on their full node since the most recent checkpoint has to access a trusted source to download the checkpoint. The trusted sources are centralized points of failure that can be shut down or coopted to disrupt the network.


No it wouldn't have been done, because people are lazy and only expend energy when they absolutely have to. This mindset is actually somewhat rational in this case, because the changes needed to make Bitcoin mining less centralized could be largely implemented overnight, and react quickly enough to an attack to prevent significant damage being done.


In reality, the only realistic scenario under which the major pools, which are significantly invested in Bitcoin, would collaborate to attack Bitcoin, is if they're coopted. A malicious party that went to the same lengths to attack a POS blockchain, and had the same legal reach and power, could permanently, rather than temporarily, hamstring it.

That's not the argument though. You said that people could easily exchange one altcoin for another if they don't use/like the one a site offers. My point was that this adds an inconvenience, since it would require them to deposit to an exchange, execute a trade, and withdraw. That's why the OP said they didn't want to use the site. That's how this whole debate started. 
You're clearly not interested in having an adult discussion about this if you can't remember the main point of contention that started our exchange. You just want to fight for your non-conformist position, regardless of the facts, and have the last word, which you can have.
My last point:
Using just BTC makes more sense than everyone using a different Bitcoin copycat. Everyone using the same currency means there's less need to visit exchanges. Those are the facts, whether you like it or not. You're free to use copycats to feel like you're different, and I'm free to not use sites that promote copycats. It's stupid to get angry at people for not believing in Bitcoin-alts like you do.

But there are still areas of the Bitcoin economy which will be underfunded for years to come, and which will only see innovation if there are no regulatory requirements on the people developing them. The collateral damage from regulating the Bitcoin economy will be terrific. It's not worth it all. I've seen dozens of examples of beneficial spin-offs coming from shoestring projects, that wouldn't have happened were the people behind them required to meet some set of licensing requirements.
The areas of the Bitcoin economy that can survive regulations are the most established services like exchanges, but they've already significantly upped their security measures, so I don't see what regulations will change.
A higher risk more innovative exchange service that can't get venture capital funding should be able to operate in the market, but with the type of regulations you're calling for, it wouldn't be able to. Consumers who are willing to park their money at a high risk experimental exchange should be free to.


What are you talking about? Bitcoin withdrawals were possible up until this last November, meaning most of 2013. There are several other major exchanges, not just MtGox, and none of them suffered a major breach in 2013 either. The Wild West has become more ordered on its own.


Or they wouldn't exist in the first place. If they were shut down by regulations half-way through their existence, then the chance of customers losing their funds would have been much higher. 
I don't see how regulations would have helped in any way. Their fiat withdrawal issues have been a result of government seizures of their funds and regulatory action against them, not technical problems. Fewer regulations would have benefited consumers in this respect. 
Their recent bitcoin withdrawal problems were due to a custom wallet implementation handling an obscure feature of the Bitcoin protocol poorly: transaction malleability. There's no way regulators would have anticipated that. I think it's very unlikely the transaction malleability bug would have played out any better if MtGox were under more regulations.

Well that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
1. "The block chain is now too big for regular users, and therefore, we will stop recommending that they install and run a full node"
2. "Oh look, the full node count dropped. We were right, a bigger block size leads to centralization."
If the burden of running a full node had made the full node count drop on its own, without a change in what client was recommended to new users, in particular on bitcoin.org, then that would be support for the theory that higher full node operating costs have a dramatically centralizing effect. But that's not what happened.

With all due respect, you're absolutely wrong that there wasn't a social contract for the 1 MB limit when it was first put in place.
The purpose of the 1 MB limit was to prevent DoS attacks through bloating of the blockchain by malicious rogue miners. Mike Hearn talks about this here:










You will not find other developers who were around at the time disputing this.
All discussions about the 1 MB limit near the time when it was first instated assumed it would be increased to provide enough capacity for legitimate tx data as the average block size approached it. For example, Satoshi's comment in 2010:


    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
      maxblocksize = largerlimit




Other comments by lead developers before and shortly after the 1 MB limit were put in place clearly show that it was intended to be a temporary anti-spam control, and NOT a tool to implement an economic policy of throttling 'legitimate' (representing transfers of non-negligible real world value) tx data, for example:


Changing the purpose of the limit from spam control to implementation of an economic policy to throttle legitimate tx data, is a change of the social contract, and requires consensus. 
Right or wrong (and I think it's right), absent consensus to change the purpose of the 1 MB hard limit from a temporary anti-spam control, the block size limit should be raised to comply with the social contract.

1 MB block size limit. It's a protocol level barrier to Bitcoin scaling up.
It's hard for any party to plan out a major push for merchant and consumer adoption when it doesn't know what will happen when transaction volumes reach 7 tps. For example, it's risky for a large company like Walmart to roll out Bitcoin payment integration nation-wide, because it could very well result in blocks filling up and fees for getting transactions processed rising dramatically.

Development on complex, open source projects doesn't happen on its own and without resources.

Capitalism does not require perfect information.

Communism assumes a government can have perfect information and this is why it fails.

The endgame is that Bitcoin removes the ability of governments to institute capital controls. At that point, there would be nothing governments would be able to do to stop people from moving value around the world, other than isolate themselves from the world economy which has deeply integrated Bitcoin. Some might choose to do just that, but liberal democracies would likely not. Governments will learn to accept the new reality, that money flows can't be restricted, just as they learned to accept that they can't really stop people from accessing any type of information (pornography, encryption algorithms) with advent of the internet.
The greatest threat is a ban on Bitcoin at an early stage, which the proposed Bitlicense regulations could potentially be, and the best defense to that is public relations and gaining more supporters. 
In the first respect, we need to make clear that these regulations are nothing more than a ban on Bitcoin, and hammer this point in, so that anyone who sees any value in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technology in general isn't lulled into acquiescing to these regulations.
In the second respect, Bitcoin needs to remove the 1 MB block size limit, and find a better bloat control mechanism that allows it to scale, as soon as possible, so that by the time some of the more liberal governments, like the USG, that are naturally more accommodating to Bitcoin, come around to thinking they should censor it, it's become an indispensable part of the economy that has too many supporters for a ban to be feasible.
This is why I made these threads:

I believe forethought and startup capital are insignificant costs/barriers compared to the billions of sunk costs required to launch a classic economic attack against a large PoW or PoS blockchain.
So there are two possibilities: buying old private keys that at one time controlled coins, or buying and selling large amounts of coins. Both of these are severe vulnerabilities IMO, because they don't have any significant costs for the attacker (it's true that the latter does require the attacker to temporarily tie up significant capital to buy, or use as collateral to borrow, the coins, but temporarily tying up capital is much less difficult than permanently expending it).


That assumes that the majority of PoW currency users aren't using SPV clients, which, even if they didn't at the outset of an attack, would likely not be the case if an attack were to occur, and further that SPV clients are possible for PoS currencies, which has not been proven. Anyway, my more relevant point is in the edit:


Savings accounts are not just for sending. They're also for depositing. A double spend here could cause tremendous damage. I also don't believe people are going to feel confident using their 'savings client' in a scenario where it's giving out a warning because it's unable to automatically download a hash from a trusted source. 


I agree that it's a lot easier to distribute 32 bytes of data than a multi-kb file amongst a library full of files. But I still hold that a lot of the inconvenience of downloading a torrent of a pirated file would apply to downloading a 32 byte hash, if there were efforts to censor its distribution. The hardest part in finding illicit data is finding a trusted source for the data, which is not heavily dependent on the amount of data involved.

The problem is that the network comes under attack while you are offline.

The entire currency is dependent on trusted parties, which makes it easier to lean on and control.

I guess that would be the absolute 'best case scenario' from the standpoint of someone investing into BTC.

Your argument (as I understand it):
* Needing to mine multiple blockchains to stay profitable increases complexity of mining, because it requires setting up merged mining. Increased complexity will encourage more use of pools 
My response:
* Pools and large mining farms probably already have a total monopoly over mining. Who's solo mining nowadays? There are also solutions to this, like GBT, and better mining software to make it easier to merge mine.
My argument for side chain decentralizing Bitcoin:
* They reduce centralized control because they allow the job of transaction validation to be split up into smaller pieces, that allow ordinary people with consumer-grade bandwidth to take on. I expound on this [here]( With only a single blockchain, the only way to contribute to transaction validation is to be able to download/upload and validate the aggregate of all transactions that occur globally, meaning as Bitcoin transaction volumes increase, and with all other factors held constant, the number of validating nodes decreases.
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:49:49
SideChains allow you to voluntarily risk your own bitcoin, transferring it to another blockchain, in a reversible manner.
SCs do not risk anyone else's bitcoin. Innovations that increase the option set without harming non-participants should always be embraced in my opinion. It's sound in principle and there is absolutely no proof that it would be harmful, let alone any historical precedent of increasing optionality being a net cost for an economy.
And the concerns about merged mining are misguided, since merged mining is not new, and is possible regardless of whether SC functionality is added. Almost every conceivable threat of merged mining applies to the SC, not the main chain.

Bitcoin is global. With 1 GB blocks, a party would only need a 1.67 MB/s broadband connection to keep up. Assuming these blocks are filled with legitimate transactions conducted by millions of people per day, there would be thousands of people around the world that both could run full nodes with those requirements and would have an economic incentive to. In other words, it would be impossible for any government to "lean on" enough full node operators to censor the network.
There are two serious risks from governments: banning merchants from accepting BTC without restrictions (e.g. only permit BTC payments with identification, or from white listed sources), and &gt;50% attack. Both of these become much less likely if the network achieves mass adoption and the public at large grows entitled to spending BTC peer-to-peer - without permission from government - as they have with physical cash.

In the context of a large-scale attack by an adversary with significant resources, I don't see what would be difficult about buying old private keys that no longer control any coins. It wouldn't be that expensive.


That's a fair point. It would be just as easy to seize a client download site and offer up a bugged client for download as it would be to seize a checkpoint site and offer up a incorrect hash. It would be much more difficult to coopt developers and have them sign off on a bugged client, but the client download site seizure is enough.
However, what I can see is a scenario where enough of the large checkpoint providers are blocked to make it difficult for the average people to get the correct hash, and that's much more likely than developers/the-client-download-site being coopted without the public finding out. If the client download site is merely blocked/taken-down, the growth in users slows, but existing users can continue using the network. In a PoS cryptocurrency, blocking major checkpoint providers is enough to seriously disrupt mainstream use of the network by existing users.
And this is not even the biggest problem with PoS. The biggest problem is that major assumptions that can be made when PoW security is used, like, as noted by Maxwell, costly simulation, don't apply when PoS is used, and I haven't been convinced by the proposals forwarded so far that the mechanisms proposed to mitigate for these weaknesses don't open up yet new security holes.

There is a big difference between occasional leaks, and systematic surveillance.
Sure, there are more leaks in the digital age, but the asymmetry between what the average member of the public knows, and what those with power and influence know, could be increasing, because those with state privilege are able to see nearly everything the average Joe does, in ways that were not possible when people didn't communicate electronically and leave a digital trail everywhere they went, while the public only sees glimpses of what those with state privilege do, when there is a leak by a Mansley or Snowden.


Effective privacy already exists for those at the top from members of the public, because members of the public do not have state privilege. As for criminals using privacy tools for nefarious deeds, yes they will do that, but privacy tools will also protect people from criminals, by preventing criminals from gaining personal information about them that could better enable them to target their victims.




I have no problem with anyone funding an army to protect their interests. But semantics aside, the powerful corporations are currently wining and dining your elected officials, and convincing them to use the public army that your taxes are funding, to further their own private interests. The power goes to the top, and it is those at the top having the means to surveille the entire population through state privilege, that is the real threat to the common man.

and then argues that Bitcoin, because it is distributed, is the former, and will always allow unregulated black market transactions:


His recommendation is that Bitcoin 2.0 be the latter, and eliminate the qualities that enable black market use:


So what he is calling for is a centralized digital currency, since it is the quality of being distributed that he says makes Bitcoin forever anonymous and outside the scope of regulations. He's advancing a delusion. There is no way the world will be satisfied with a central authority controlling the currency they use.

Miners can use pools to handle side chain merge-mining, so it can be zero extra cost for miners.

But we shouldn't be required to prove up front that we will be able to go to the courts, to be 'permitted' to launch a service.
People are free to demand contact information and proof of identity of us as a condition for using our service, but if a service is anonymous and doesn't offer this information, and someone chooses to use it, that is a risk they are willingly taking on, and therefore we shouldn't be making anonymous services illegal.


True, my example with credit cards was bad. Still, the fraud protection in credit cards comes with high costs. This type of consumer protection law is not good because it doesn't give the consumer a lower cost option that doesn't include these protections. There will be cases where such lower cost, lower security services hold an advantage for the consumer. For example, they may not need reversibility for microtransactions, or with people they trust. If they want reversibility, a service provider can offer it, for a price. This should be an option, not always bundled with payment services. 


It is absolutely not. The basis of taking away people's choice to use high-risk services is that they're not capable of making the correct decisions for their lives. This is exactly like treating them like children, which is why it puts into question the basis of every right we recognize in our civilization, including universal voting rights for adults.


If BTC is going to have gatekeepers that people need to come to for approval before launching a service, then it's no better than what we have now. What makes it revolutionary is that anyone, anywhere in the world can offer a service, without having to ask for permission.
So far, in a situation where almost every type of Bitcoin service is free to launch without having to meet any regulatory requirements, BTC has been gaining acceptance, with several major retailers starting to accept it in just the last few months. The trend doesn't indicate we need to start giving regulators the power to filter what services come to market in order for BTC to become mainstream. It'll become mainstream if it simply continues its trajectory.


Agreed, but we can also argue for our belief that no regulatory requirements on Bitcoin businesses would be better than some regulatory requirements, whilst advocating for lighter and less disruptive regulations covering a smaller subset of the Bitcoin ecosystem over more stringent regulations with broad applicability across the  Bitcoin economy.

And they will not rise sufficiently to provide Bitcoin with adequate security unless transaction volumes rise substantially. A major barrier to increases in transaction volume is the growth in resource requirements for running a full node with blocks bigger, which harms Bitcoin's decentralization.
Sidechains are a way of giving miners a means of earning transaction fees by increasing the total volume of transactions they validate while mining Bitcoin without causing the resource requirements for running a full Bitcoin node to skyrocket.


Merge-mined sidechains can be attacked, but that's nothing new: merge-mined chains are always vulnerable to attack from those mining the main chain. It's extremely unlikely it will threaten Bitcoin however. Bitcoin will benefit from the sidechain activity as the centrally located blockchain in the Bitcoin sidechain ecosystem, so its blockchain will have the most value being transacted on it, leading to it to being the highest fee generator.
It is far far more likely that the increased mining revenues for Bitcoin miners from sidechain merge-mining will improve security, by increasing the network hashrate.

Exactly. Laws that discriminate against peer-to-peer digital currencies would hinder innovation and seem to have no other intent than to stifle a disruptive industry. Whatever laws apply to traditional currency, should apply to Bitcoin. Nothing more, nothing less. If the distributed nature of peer-to-peer digital currencies makes enforcement of some laws and the combating of some crimes more difficult, the police forces need to find different strategies to deal with those problems, not expect an entire class of technologies to be straight-jacketed and put back in bottle with innovation-killing laws.

But the incentive is to break any such pact, since there is no way miners can punish a self-interested miner who does. The miner who breaks the pact will earn fees on all of those lower fee transactions that the others miners are not accepting, and earn more than them.
This is the prisoner's dilemma that suppliers in a free market face, and it means miners cannot effectively conspire or coordinate their actions to raise the average transaction fee. They will always be in competition with each other and lack the ability to enforce a price-fixing pact.


Feeless transactions are a subject of a different debate, and nothing in relation to them supports your claim that one day, miners will reject low-fee transactions. There is no incentive for any miner to accept feeless transactions, because it is not profitable for any miner to do so. It is, however, profitable for every miner to accept every low-fee transaction that earns them more BTC than it costs them in CPU power and bandwidth to transmit. This means extremely low-fee transactions will fill up blocks until the block size limit is reached.

If you want to stick to only the most trusted services, then go ahead and only use Coinbase and Bitpay and stay away from the other companies, but don't call for regulations to make it illegal for me to use the services of a less trusted provider.


The regulations make sure there are barely any start up banks, so that the oligopoly of major banks have a captive customer base.

Almost all of those 20 major Bitcoin exchanges either look extremely unprofessional, even compared to MtGox, had trading lags, and didn't appear to have as many security features like two-factor authentication.


You mean like the Libor scandal? Look, a hack of one exchange (or a government seizure of its cold wallet?) is not the end of Bitcoin. The type of regulatory requirements that would have prevented a leaking of a cold wallet would have made it impossible for any Bitcoin exchange to exist in the first place. Regulators would have needed to decide on what custom wallet implementation and cold wallet scheme is secure enough to use in an Bitcoin exchange, and they probably would never have gotten around to doing it, leaving Bitcoin exchanges permanently illegal.
Mistakes happen in any context, and in Bitcoin, they have been happening from the beginning, without the world coming to an end. The lack of regulatory requirements has allowed thousands of companies and services that otherwise wouldn't have existed to exist.

A couple points: we have more trolls in and more people who are committed to fostering a respectable image for cryptocurrency and who discourage using tactics like tip-spamming (e.g. sending tips worth less than a penny) and using memes to promote Bitcoin. This leads to a more self-critical and serious subreddit that's less fun. 
I would argue cryptocurrency wouldn't have gotten very far in mainstream adoption without the attitude that the Bitcoin community has had. A case in point: allowed the bot to post there for months, because most tips were not trivial amounts. As soon as Dogecoin users starting their fork of the bitcointip bot to spam tips there, the mods there banned the bitcointip bot and all of its altcoin forks. 
So I think to some extent, Dogecoin is getting ahead at the expense of the respect people have for cryptocurrency as a serious method of effecting commerce. On the other hand, the embrace of using humor, memes and spamming could help cryptocurrency by increasing adoption among the young and casual users.
This is what I suggested as a way for Bitcoin to stay competitive with meme-based forks:

I'm not trying to defend the Foundation board members, because I don't know them well enough to know them to be honest, but:
Being involved in a lawsuit doesn't mean Vessenes is dishonest.
If you're contending that Foundation board members are not observant enough of the law, then you would have a point in Shrem's case, but you're not making that argument. You're accusing them of being dishonest. While the alleged actions of Shrem are indeed criminal, they don't show him to be dishonest (meaning a fraudster). 
Having a poorly functioning exchange doesn't mean Karpeles is dishonest. It's not established that MtGox is "holding peoples funds hostage". As we saw in Shrem's case, not strictly following KYC/AML regulations can be very dangerous for an owner of a business involved in currency exchange. There is also the risk of hacks that a Bitcoin exchange has to deal with. Given these two facts, delays in verification and withdrawals of BTC could be a case of security measures combined with a shortage of staff.

It's a perfectly appropriate analogy because the usefulness of currency is dependent on the network of people that use and accept it, and it grows as that network grows, creating a snowballing effect where the leading currency becomes increasingly dominant over time. For this reason, even in the absence of legal tender laws, economies have often come to largely rely on one, or a small number of currencies, to act as mediums of exchange. 
Historically, gold, silver and copper were the most common currencies. They each were ideally suited for transactions of different values, due to their different weight to value ratios. With Bitcoin, its divisibility and digital quality makes it suited for any sized transaction.


Fragmentation is a real risk for mass adoption of any open source software. It's largely why Linux didn't overtake Windows on the desktop. Android is doing well because there is a very large company pushing it, and ensuring standardization across different handsets. Otherwise it would face the problem with fragmentation too.
For an open source digital currency, fragmentation is doubly risky, because it also means the effective inflation of the currency supply. The more the market is fragmented across very similar forks of the original digital currency, the more currency units are in contention. Without some type of durable market advantage against copycat forks, open source digital currency will have difficulty maintaining value, and will therefore not be able to function as currency.
The best hope for cryptocurrency is for one currency to attain enough of a network scale advantage that it is preferred over near identical forks, and that it quickly adopt all innovations in the space to avoid being leapfrogged. That is the only way an open source digital currency will be trusted by the market to hold its value over the long run. Without that trust in its ability to hold value, it won't be able to compete with fiat currencies, and won't be able to change the world.
As for the criticism that this is an "argument used by totalitarians all over the world" - this is absolutely false, because no one is arguing for totalitarian measures to outlaw altcoins or imprison their makers. They are free to ignore the suggestions being made and plow ahead. With totalitarians, you are not free to ignore their suggestions, because they will impose their decision on you.

I defend the right of people to pursue their own interests. Investing your life, or your fortune, into the development of a product that will save lives, for the interest of profiting, is not wrong. Absent the investment, the product would not even exist, so it does not harm us, as a society, to allow people to make profit off of developing life-saving products. If you profit, it necessarily means you are charging a price that not everyone will be able to afford, and therefore not savings as many lives as you could. That doesn't make you a villain. It just means you're not a saint.

I'm not referring to Blockstream's specific proposal. Not all potential implementations would take 2 days to convert. If it takes, say, 3 hours to convert, that would be negligible, especially considering it usually takes several hours at the very least to travel to a new region.
And we CAN all use one universal currency. Everyone would have both the main chain and their SC,  at the very least, stored by their wallet software. The main chain would always be available and people would have the majority of their bitcoins on it, since it would be much more secure than the side chains. The side chains are channels, leading to the main chain, that increase its power and the demand for it.

They could rewrite the Bitcoin blockchain going back to the last checkpoint, once, at great expense to themselves, before they lose all of their miners. This would most likely be followed by a hard fork to orphan their replacement chain.
It would be devastating (though not fatal) for Bitcoin, and for GHash, so unless they are owned by a state level adversary and everything they have invested is for the purpose of being sacrificed in a &gt;50% attack, it's unlikely they will attack Bitcoin. In any case, this is not a good situation to be in, and the sooner decentralized mining methods like P2Pool and Getblocktemplate become user-friendly enough to find wide adoption, the better.

Litecoin copied Tenebrix's hashing algorithm. The creator of Scrypt also said the implementation used by Litecoin and the other BTC-alts is flawed, and not ASIC resistant.
Anyway, copying everything in Bitcoin, even the coin issuance curve (block reward halving every four years until it goes to zero), and just swapping out the hashing algorithm for a different one, even an ASIC proof one, and changing the block time, is not different enough to make it not a copycat.

And Bitcoin's legal status is also fragile. While small, it is vulnerable. Before more repressive states, and even liberal democracies get the idea of instituting laws to restrict and control its use, we need Bitcoin to become an indispensable part of people's lives, the way the internet is now. If the internet had taken an additional 20 years to scale past a few thousand daily users, there's a real possibility we would need a license to run a server now. Now a law being passed instituting such a license would be unthinkable, because the majority of the public has grown accustomed to the idea of an internet that's freely accessible.

You just argued that nodes would refuse large reorganizations:


This method of network security is called cementing, and it's not used in Bitcoin because it causes a split in the network when a fork is introduced. Nodes which already have a copy of the blockchain will reject the fork, while new nodes that don't cannot distinguish between the original chain, and the fork. There is no way to resolve this split without introducing a slow, trust based process of achieving consensus.


The presence or absence of competition does not change whether or not an attacker can rewrite the blockchain. What it comes down to is trust. In POS, there needs to be a group of people that the network trusts, so that the chain they create is accepted over another. This trusted group is a central structure, that can be attacked.


Peercoin now uses POW in conjuction with its POS, and before that, used centralized checkpointing. 


You're not going to learn anything if you dismiss counter viewpoints as "moronic dribble".


I never argued they're impossible. I argued that they don't achieve distributed consensus. They're not secure against attacks on their central structure. If a currency ever becomes a serious force in the world economy, governments will seek to control it, and with a central structure, they will be able to. Right now they're eclipsed by Bitcoin, so no one of significance, particularly a government, cares about them. Bitcoin itself is almost too small for governments to care about that. When considering the future though, one must consider how governments would react if these currencies had a real impact in the world.
All of Bitcoin's current weaknesses are a matter of its implementation, rather than inherent to its use of POW. As it matures, they can all be overcome. Mining pool software can be improved to remove the control pools have over chain and transaction selection in mining, P2Pool can be made scalable, ASIC manufacturing can be ramped up until ASICs are commodities that cost a little more than the raw material that go into them, at which point mining will be found anywhere cheap or free energy is found, etc etc. But POS is necessarily centralized, because without a trusted party being relied upon, it cannot maintain consensus.

"A Digital Currency Fund Specializing in AltCoins"
They've made a bet that Bitcoin will not be the winner, and that could lead to bias affecting their commentary.
That being said, I agree with much of what Lukas Ryan says. One factor I believe he's missing is that sidechains can be partially backed by bitcoin and have multiple 'distributed consensus' (I hesitate to call PoS distributed consensus) protocols securing them simultaneously. This largely solves objections 1, 2, and 3 that he raises.
For instance, Ethereum could become partially pegged to Bitcoin as a sidechain, where its native currency and bitcoin-backed coins need to be combined at some ratio to create the active currency that can be used on the Ethereum blockchain. That would preserve the initial Ethereum investors' stake, while providing a much easier avenue to transfer capital into the Ethereum ecosystem. It would also provide an incentive to Bitcoin stakeholders to support the Ethereum sidechain, because of the partial bitcoin backing that its active currency has, and reduce their incentive to support a Ethereum fork.

That would be unprofitable for the miners both because hostile strategies like building chains in secret earn miners fewer bitcoins, and because it would reduce the value of bitcoin. There would be an immediate exodus of miners from a pool that was exposed as being hostile to Bitcoin.

The default behavior of Bitcoin nodes is currently to connect to other nodes randomly. Doubling a cryptocurrency network as a social network, with trusted links, is a whole new challenge, that hasn't been demonstrated to work. And then there's the problem that most people are not going to know anyone that runs a full node, as most users end up using web wallets.

I don't know if the criminalisation of money laundering is what most people take issue with. It's using the fight against money laundering to justify what many consider a moral crime: violating financial privacy, that I believe is the major issue people have with current AML laws.
But that aside, to claim that money laundering is happening is to suppose money was earned from the commission of a crime, which if there is evidence for, can be prosecuted on its own accord, and if there isn't, there can be no proof that money laundering is occurring. A law against money laundering does seem redundant on the face of it.

I don't think it's extreme to not trust the claims of people who may very well have a vested interest in what the public perception of the subject is. 


I don't follow. I'm supposed to not trust myself, in order to be consistent? I've never asked anyone to trust me. People can verify what I'm saying on their own.


False. Satoshi mined like everyone else. NXT's creator actually had a privilege reserved, programmatically, to him, in that he was able to receive the Bitcoin paid for the NXT that only he was able to create.


That's the distribution among wallets, not people, so there's really no basis for your claim at all.


That doesn't have to do with impartiality so it's not a problem. Impartiality means that the identity of the coin generator doesn't affect their ability to generate coins. Anyone, with a given piece of hardware/hashrate, will have the same probability of producing a bitcoin. This is the impartiality of a math-based distribution scheme.


I'm referring to impartially not equality of outcome. An impartial distribution scheme can still have winners who out-compete the rest. All that impartiality means is that the rules are the same for everyone.


You didn't provide what I asked. You provided a math paper about the probability of events within the NXT protocol. I need a comprehensive description of how the protocol works, that's written in plain language. It goes without saying that it should be accessible in its form of presentation. You're citing an arcane and barely relevant paper and then criticizing me for not being satisfied.

I disagree because the blockchain can be wound back, and the vulnerability that allowed the attack can be fixed. The knowledge that the network is immune to further attacks would help repair its credibility.


Cheap energy is highly distributed, and the need for heat even more so, and these forces will act to distribute ASIC holdings as they become commodified and used to consume cheap excess energy or to heat buildings as dual-use resisters in electric heaters.


I have no reason to be in denial. It's you who's in denial of Ripple's trust based consensus system. A small network of mutually trusting nodes establishes consensus, and these nodes form a small central structure that can be easily attacked. Growing the size of the network is difficult because of the requirement that each need be trusted. It's the opposite of a resilient, trustless and censorproof cryptocurrency.


Bitcoin's reliance on a few large pools can be discarded if it's ever attacked or threatened. Ripple is permanently depended on a small number of validators being trustworthy. An attack on the network would cause a fork to all clients, even those connected to a validator that's trustworthy and not directly attacked.


Considering Ripple is centralized, that doesn't prove anything.
@_date: 2014-12-13 07:58:13
False, only those clients that change will accept the fork. If 51% mine on a new protocol, they're generating an incompatible fork. The entired installed user base will accept the original protocol and reject the fork.
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:23:58
Side chains and an increase in block size are not mutually exclusive. Side chains are a great solution, but they are a partial solution, because they will never fully substitute for main chain transactions, and in any case, they are a long way from being developed and implemented so BTC is going to need a way to grow until then.
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:10:02


But the Bitcoin protocol allows it to be a continuous thing. The only change with SC functionality is that you can reanimate those BTC that you 'burn' at a later date. It's just a new transaction type from the perspective of Bitcoin proper. It has no other effect on MC users, with the effect being confined to those who want to try out SC functionality.
With all of the things people are free to do with their BTC right now, it makes zero sense to me why you'd be so concerned with people being able to do one additional thing with their own BTC. I repeat, their own BTC.


Which is just puzzling.


It's puzzling to me why you think additional functionality as a payment network or asset exchange would not boost its functionality as an investment, given anything people want to use BTC for increases the demand for BTC.

This is how I explained it before:
There is a distinction between propagation confirmation and block confirmation. In the first, the recipient confirms that the transaction has propagated to most nodes in the network, which happens nearly instantly, and this is sufficient security for most transactions, as it requires thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin and hardware for the sender to invalidate a transaction that has propagated throughout the network.
In the second, the recipient confirms that a transaction has been included in a block of transactions that has been made nearly irreversible by a difficult to reproduce hash, and this takes ~10 minutes. This is necessary for very large transactions where the recipient wants to protect himself against a sophisticated attacker with substantial processing power at his disposal.  
I would add that in the case of an automated web service, it would be a good idea to wait for at least one block confirmation before shipping the product. In a point of sale situation not involving huge amounts of money, like a restaurant, getting only a propagation confirmation is sufficient.


Yes. As soon as your node detects the transaction, it means it's properly formed and will be considered valid once it's included in a block.

Joe has 5% of his BTC in his state sidechain, and 95% in the main chain. His state side chain is cheaper to use (less demand for space in the blockchain) so he uses it for local txs. The main chain is for inter-regional transaction, and where he keeps his BTC savings.
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:24:34
And the rules of the original protocol also allow you to burn your BTC by sending to an unspendable address. So why would you oppose functionality that can increase the demand for BTC, by simply adding the ability to reanimate, at a later date, those BTC that you 'burn'?
Is it just because it's changing the original protocol? Or is there something about sending to a special address, and then reclaiming your BTC with a special reanimation transaction, that is fundamentally different in terms of effects on the greater Bitcoin economy, than risking your BTC with a Trusted Third Party, or burning them?

Ben, do you realize that the organizations covered, under the regulations as they are proposed now, would include websites that do not touch legal tender and merely hold BTC for their users?
"Virtual Currency Business Activity" is defined as:










value, or the conversion or exchange of one form of Virtual Currency into another form of Virtual Currency; or 


(1) and (2) are extremely common practices among sites dealing with BTC. The proposed regulations state that if a person is engaged in any of these activities (including (1) and (2)), they require a license:


Innovative websites like  which allow users to tip each other bitcoins through Reddit, Twitter, and other social media services, would suddenly need to meet all of the bank level regulations, like fingerprinting their employees and getting the name and address of all users, proposed.
Most types of Bitcoin services, like the Bitcoin tipping services exemplified by Changetip, are run and created by hacker type entrepreneurs, doing things for fun on shoestring budgets. You would essentially be making all of these people run afoul of the law if they refuse to run their experiments like high-security banks and get licenses from the state of New York.
Please, change the regulations to limit the licensing requirements to EXCHANGES, that provide legal-tender &lt;-&gt; bitcoin currency exchange services, and not any person who engages in any activity that in way involves handling  BTC.

The optimisations I refer to are about preventing that from happening.
The reason why larger blocks are needed for any further major increase in adoption is obvious. You can't have anything close to mainstream adoption with only 1 MB of transaction data every 10 minutes.

So far, holding BTC has been more profitable than using it to buy mining equipment. Using fiat to buy mining equipment has been profitable historically though, so if you can afford to spend some fiat, I would recommend using it to buy some BTC, and spending that BTC to buy mining equipment.
As for which mining equipment, there is nothing wrong with buying ASICs. It helps decentralize and defend the network. If you buy GPUs, I recommend using Middlecoin.com as your pool. It's an auto-switching pool that finds the most profitable coin to mine and pays out the earnings in BTC.

Just to clarify, I have no affiliation with Blockstream.


The for-profit company's main project will be open-source, meaning there is no way for it to use the project to give itself an unfair advantage, or somehow centralize control of the Bitcoin protocol around its own facilities.
Just because the organization is for-profit, doesn't necessarily mean that we need to be wary of it. There are sound legal reasons to prefer to fund an open source project through a for-profit company rather than a non-profit organization. It gives the organization more legal latitude to create paid ancillary services that can help it fund further open source projects, for instance.
But putting all of that aside, what's important is the reputation of the core devs who are on Blockstream's payroll, which I believe is above reproach, and the fact that the side chain project is open source, meaning we don't need to trust its developers. 


lukejr was involved in the Blockstream project because he has been a long-time contributor to the Bitcoin project, not because Blockstream agrees with his censorship policies. He's not one of Blockstream's full time employees, and on the issue of pools censoring transactions by type, he's opposed by the majority of the Bitcoin core devs. 
He's been using his pool to censor transactions for a long time, long before Blockstream was founded, so this recent attempt to add blacklists to Gentoo bitcoind has nothing to do with Blockstream's agenda.

It's not good, but keep in mind that they're merely pools, that other people direct their hashes to. They do not have a permanent control over those hashes, and miners will be pointed elsewhere if they start abusing their status.
Long-term, finding a way to decentralize pools would of course be helpful, but the current situation is not as bad as 'BTC Guild and GHash control over 50% of the network hashrate'. The only people who control the hashrate are the people who decide where a miner is pointed to.

Bitcoin is a very good first implementation of the proof-of-work based decentralized timestamp server type of protocol it heralded. It's also open source making it less likely to fall victim to things like a poor management decision.
For another currency to supercede it, it would need to have significant technical improvements over it, to overcome its first mover advantage. Bitcoin has such a technical advantage over older currencies and payment networks, but I don't see much space, given the current state of technology and the problems Bitcoin has already solved, for a similar leap to be made relative to Bitcoin.

I haven't been keeping a close eye on Ethereum development, but from what I understand, it's far past the stage of vaporware, and has substantial working code. What it comes down to though is that the final product needs to work, with the incentives it provides and the resource constraints it will face, and we haven't seen that yet.


I do not support Proof of Stake, but I think it's important we give it a fair shake. Checkpointing in this case would be a slow convergence process, used to give an accurate picture of the broader structure of the blockchain. Its slow rate is tolerable because there is a lot of time between the checkpoints, giving the process adequate time to complete. The Proof of Stake voting would be the faster convergence process, that synchronizes a higher resolution global view of the blockchain. 
The idea is that these different processes are used together because they make up for each other's weaknesses.

You need to get licensed by the State of New York, and register and fingerprint your employees! It's ridiculous. It's not going to be consistently enforced. The decision of when to enforce it will be arbitrary, and that's the quality of bad law.
Furthermore, if customers really want to use a service that does not have sound security practices, and is holding a million dollars in BTC deposits, that should really be up to them. A third party imposing a standard of security, as condition for the two parties to be permitted to engage in the business activity together, is fundamentally opposed to the principle of liberal democracy, which is that the individual is sovereign, and has a right to make bad decisions for themselves.

I don't know what has happened in the last month or two, but if that's case, I'd appreciate a link, because I have seen lots of false information to hype NXT over the last year.


Despite the name, premining doesn't mean coins are generated through mining. It means some or all of the coins are generated by the creators, before everyone else can start creating them. In the case of NXT, all of them were generated by NXT's creators.


It's still impartial because who is rewarded the coins is based on math, not the decisions of a trusted central authority.


He chose to mine when others didn't, but everyone else was free to mine as well.

Yes, the MtGox collapse harms the Bitcoin price, but if Bitcoin exchanges had been required to meet bank-level regulations, to avoid situations like the current one with MtGox's apparent insolvency, MtGox never would have been opened in the first place, and there would have been no exchange to serve the market in 2010 and 2011 when MtGox was the only player, so the Bitcoin economy would probably have failed to get off the ground, and the price would be much lower than it is now.

In the long run, merchant adoption is a massive net positive for the price. Besides speculation, what drives demand for BTC? The ability to spend it. Liquidity is what creates demand for a currency.
Imagine a future where all early adopters that were willing to cash out their BTC at some point, have cashed them out. At that point, any BTC spent at merchants, is BTC that was bought specifically for the purpose of spending it, and all support for the BTC price will come from those buying BTC for the short term in order to spend them at merchants. 
This is what Bitcoin will eventually come to, as the total spendable holdings of early adopters are finite, and will eventually run out. Early adopters cashing out their BTC holdings at merchants is not an equilibrium state.

What about altcoins that don't rely on a different inflation schedule for their appeal? Why are you so certain that SCs can't compete with them? It seems like you deliberately chose an edge case where SCs can't compete, to dispute the entire notion that SCs can compete with altcoins. Why?
I don't understand your insistence on coming up with excuses to oppose SCs rather than evaluate them objectively.


How does SPVP harm Bitcoin proper? SCs would increase demand for bitcoin, because they would increase their possible uses. Why are you so dismissive of the potential benefits?


Bitshares competes with Bitcoin. How does it hurt Bitcoin to allow SCs to be created that use BTC and compete with an altcoin blockchain like Bitshares that use an altcoin? And MC and CP are not Bitcoin. It doesn't harm Bitcoin to give people an option to use a SC version of either.

That's exactly what I'm addressing. Miners can use P2Pool to mine Bitcoin proper, while using (a) pool(s) to simultaneously merge-mine side chains. By using pools to handle the side chain overhead, they're not having to increase their costs to get full profitability, and by using P2Pool to mine Bitcoin proper, mining on the Bitcoin main chain is not being concentrated in pools.


GBT allows miners to source their block headers from a different source than the pool. Given there are no benefits from using a more widely used block header source (unlike more widely used pools, which offer lower payout variability), sources for block headers can be extremely distributed.

Yea, just to further explain (in case this is the first time you've heard about this and don't know all of the details): the point of a malicious/dishonest mining party building the blocks in secret is to fool a merchant accepting a transaction into thinking it's confirmed (which it would be in the public chain), and then replace that public chain segment with the chain segment that was being created in secret, and have in this new chain segment a transaction that double-spends/invalidates that previously confirmed transaction. 
By the time the merchant sees the transaction go from being 'confirmed' to 'unconfirmed', they would have already handed the malicious party the merchandise, allowing the attacker to receive goods without paying for them.

A nonsensical opinion based on paranoid conspiracy theories. And in any case, you have no right to deny people a path. If they want to use a sidechain, for any reason, they should have the ability to use one. Optionality is good.

The set size is determined by the CoinJoin software used. The larger the set, the longer you have to wait until the set is assembled. The advantage of CoinJoin over exchanging for altcoins or using e-wallet that withdraw from a common pool of address is that it's trust free.
As for 'practically impossible', that's the best that a privacy protection method can do. The extent of privacy a method gives dependent on the size of the group using the method.

The requirements of a fraud proof voting system that protects privacy are:
Having an auditable public record linking each individual with a unique public key used for voting.
Being able to cryptographically derive which public keys voted, without knowing who they voted for.
* Edit, I've created a scheme based on Bitcoin and Zerocoin that I believe meets these criteria. 
There would be a public record showing the name of each voter and the public key that is linked to them. The public key is provided by the voter themselves, so they can be certain that only they have the private key for it. 
Next, each voter would be credited with 1 VoteCoin to their public address. Before a certain date, all voters would be required to mint a ZeroVoteCoin, which must be paid for with their 1 VoteCoin (which they can spend using their private key), similar to the Zerocoin scheme where a bitcoin is spent to mint a zerocoin. They would save the secret serial number they used to mint the ZeroVoteCoin, for later use.
On election day, each voter uses their secret serial number to create a zero knowledge proof that they minted a ZeroVoteCoin, in order to redeem their ZeroVoteCoin for a VoteCoin, and credits the new VoteCoin to the public key of the candidate they want to vote for. The candidate with the most VoteCoins is elected. Since the Zerocoin scheme obscures which VoteCoin credited the ZeroVoteCoin that was later redeemed, the public knows that a particular VoteCoin was used, by a particular person, but not which candidate they voted for.

Most of Bitcoin's functionality as a store of value comes from its utility as a payment mechanism. Something can only be an effective store of value if it can retain its value. And where does Bitcoin get its value? The demand that exists to hold it. Some of that demand comes from the appeal its digital scarcity has to speculators, but this is only appealing to speculators in combination with its other qualities. If all Bitcoin had was its digital scarcity, it wouldn't have value, because that can easily be diluted by altcoins. 
The primary quality that sets Bitcoin apart from dime-a-dozen clones is the demand for it as a transactional currency. The transaction volume is very hard for clones to duplicate, and is the non-speculative (real) component of the market demand for bitcoin currency units. 
Bitcoin's security is the other quality that creates demand for it. The massive hashrate ensures that the network will not be compromised, and this makes it appealing as a store of value. But the hashrate is only sustained in the long run if there are enough transaction fees to support it.
The demand for bitcoin as a transactional currency, and Bitcoin's network hashrate, will be severely limited if there is an artificial block size limit in place that pushes transaction fees up and makes smaller transactions un-economical.

Please explain how requiring that any website that holds your funds in a wallet be required to get your ID before providing you with a service, is a good thing. This regulation wouldn't just apply to exchanges. 
It would apply to any Bitcoin e-wallet, meaning that if this regulation could be enforced, hosted Bitcoin wallets would virtually all disappear.
The only point in using a hosted wallet is being able to start sending/receiving BTC in a matter of minutes, which you can't do if you have to first send your photo ID to the wallet provider and wait for them to check it. Requiring a user to provide ID also eliminates one the main advantages and primary reasons for using Bitcoin, which is to be able to stay anonymous and while making a payment.

An attack on Bitcoin would be a huge event. It would light up the blogosphere and create a massive outpouring of support for Bitcoin.


Oh I agree with that. My point though is that in a critical scenario where a deep pocketed adversary is attempting to dominate the network hashrate, changing the algorithm frequently enough to prevent specialised hardware from being developed for it would level the playing field as the public at large has more general computing power than a government could purchase. The key is motivation. The general public would need to want to see Bitcoin survive in the event of a major government attack, so that millions would mine, and I believe they would.

I got that you think it's not accurate. That second sentence is redundant. 
To your point: company size is not measured by physical size, as obviously that would be a ridiculous interpretation of size in this context. Similarly, it's not a measure of number of employees, as one company can be more far more productive than another and still have fewer employees, because its processes are automated.
Revenues is getting closer to what 'size' means here, but it ignores assets, like brand, rapid market growth, etc, that give a company influence and power. 
Market cap tells us how much people are willing to pay for all of the assets of a company, which gives us the least gameable measure of size (as paying more for a stock than its fundamental value is extremely costly), and the one that correlates most closely with long term economic impact. 
I'm not alone in this view. Many lists of world's largest company use market cap as the measure of size so when you throw an insult at me, accusing me of "having zero clue as to what I'm talking about", you're claiming the business sections of some of the most widely circulated newspapers in the world "don't know what they're talking about", making yourself look like an arrogant blow hard:

They add no risk as they have no effect on the main chain. They alleviate the risk of the cryptocurrency market fragmenting along dozens of blockchains, some innovative, and some mere forks of each other. By allowing the coin supply of Bitcoin, the dominant cryptocurrency, to incorporate new features, they inhibit this fragmentary risk, which is the biggest risk to mass adoption of cryptocurrency. 
Cryptocurrency would not be able to compete against fiat currencies, with their government monopolies, if it saw effective hyper inflation via market fragmentation across an ever increasing number of blockchains, each with their own coin supplies.
Sidechains also allow Bitcoin to scale without causing resource requirements for running full nodes to increase exponentially. This is important for every aspect of cryptocurrency. Regional sidechains used for small value transactions don't need to be as secure as Bitcoin mainchain, and could offload much of the small/microtransactions. The alternative to sidechains is Trusted Third Party payment intermediaries like Coinbase that are extremely easily captured by regulators. 
Even the Hub and Spoke microtransaction payment channel system advocated by Peter Todd as an alternative to all other proposed scalability solutions can be captured by regulators (while creating a huge privacy vulnerability), as the Hubs are centralized parties that gain utility with size (therefore have a tendency towards centralization).
Putting all of this aside, why do you oppose people having the option, yes **option**, to use a feature that has no technical effect on the Bitcoin blockchain? No one would be forced to use this option. Why do want them to not have the option altogether?

It would be legally much more difficult for a government to go after ASIC makers, for a whole host of reasons, including ASICs being usable for other things besides generating hashes to authorize offending blocks. 
By the time Bitcoin becomes large enough to become a major consideration of government policy, I would hope (and expect), that ASICs will be commodities, and too plentiful and easy to manufacture for legal action against their manufacturers to even be considered.
In the worst case and highly unlikely scenario that a campaign against ASIC manufacturers was launched, and was making headway, Bitcoin's only hope would be that a CPU-friendly PoW algorithm had been discovered that it could switch to, which, given the time frame we're talking about (even if everything goes to plan, it would probably be something like 20-30 years before Bitcoin is a global economic force and such extreme attacks enter the realm of plausibility), doesn't seem that far-fetched.
As for paying miners to attack the network, this is certainly possible, and every consensus protocol dependent on the economic majority being honest to be secure is vulnerable to economic attacks like this. I think it's far less likely than, say, a government taking over an exchange that holds PoS coins and becoming the largest voting block.

Altcoins will not vanish. They'll just lose some market share. And there's nothing stopping a sidechain from using a different hashing algorithm. If cryptocurrency is going to succeed, it needs digital scarcity. If the market for cryptocurrency gets fragmented between an increasing number of altcoins, each with its own money supply, that digital scarcity erodes, through what's effectively inflation. Sidechains can allow for blockchain innovation that doesn't threaten the digital scarcity of the cryptocurrency asset class created by Bitcoin.

The PoW based blockchain protocol is the only decentralized and secure rapid consensus protocol. Mining concentration in Bitcoin is a matter of implementation, and not inherent to PoW.

Please explain why you want no one to have the option to use a pegged asset.
This is what this really comes down to I believe: you want to give altcoins a chance to compete against Bitcoin, and therefore don't want Bitcoin to have sidechain functionality that can take away any potential competitive advantage they may have.
This is why you use speculation about a hypothetical future where Bitcoin is changed to "force" you to use sidechains, to argue that we should not allow sidechain functionality to be implemented into Bitcoin that would be 100 percent voluntary to use.
That is why you speculate about conspiracies by the Bitcoin core developers.
It's also why you tell us that we shouldn't worry about an altcoin displacing Bitcoin:


You don't want the Bitcoin ecosystem to be able to adopt better features via sidechains, because you want altcoins to have a chance of displacing Bitcoin.

I've read, and I can't actually remember anyone calling for the US government to decommission the dollar and replace it with bitcoin or gold. I'm sure there are a few who would like to switch to gold, but I'd think there are more who'd like bitcoin, gold and other currencies to be used freely alongside the dollar.


I think what he meant is that the market will choose bitcoin over fiat currency, which will lead to an economy less subject to the forces of inflation, not that the US government will switch to a fixed supply currency. As long as fiat dollars are legal tender, we won't see the kind of liquidity problems that you're talking about, because there will always be a way for the government to make liquidity available. 


Nope, but when someone justifies their own position by restating their opinion on that position (asset backed currencies didn't work because we know they didn't work), that's trolling.

Of course, it's granted that all things are remaining equal. For instance, I'm assuming there are no technical risks to the main chain from adding sidechain functionality. In this case, if sidechains give people 100 options, even if 99 of them are bad, they're good overall, since people will trend toward avoiding the 99 poor ones, and using only the good one, making sidechain functionality a net benefit.


Or they will make a better protocol easier to experiment with, and thereby make people more quick to adopt it. Once people have tried out the new protocol with their sidecoin-bitcoins and seen how it works, they would feel more comfortable with it being incorporated into the main chain.


You could be right. I'm only commenting on the risk of people losing money on sidechains. I'd argue that's a problem that will solve itself over time as people learn, the hard way, which characteristics lend to a secure sidechain, or at least best practices on how to use sidechains while minimizing risk (e.g. only store your coins on a sidechain for a short period of time).

I think giving retailers the option of accepting transactions instantly via a less secure decentralized method or a totally secure and somewhat centralized instant method is better than giving them no options, so I see the push to deliberately reduce the already imperfect security of zero-conf transaction to the point where they would cease to be a viable option for many retailers, by encouraging miners to adopt replace-by-fee, as detrimental.

For sidechains serving as a functionality solution, I believe this will often be true.
For example, if Ethereum opted to become a Bitcoin sidechain, the reward for original investors into Ethereum could be preserved by making Ether only partially pegged to bitcoin currency
How it would work is that generating an active-Ether, which is needed to use Ethereum features, would require a user combining bitcoin-Ether and original-Ether (this is the Ether issued to investors from the original IPO) in some to be determined ratio. Bitcoin-Ether would be brought into the system how you would expect: by transferring bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain into the Ethereum blockchain. 
The cost for Bitcoin, if the Ethereum sidechain, with its partially pegged active-Ether, succeeded, and totally supplanted Bitcoin, would be an effective dilution of bitcoin currency, due to a migration from using full bitcoins to using the partial bitcoin that is the active-Ether concoction. But Bitcoin holders would almost certainly see a net increase in the value of their bitcoin holdings, as such a migration would only occur if the new capabilities added to the Bitcoin SC ecosystem by Ethereum were significant, and substantially increased its user base, which would more than offset the downward pressure on the value of bitcoin from the dilution.
But to your point: I agree that multi-currency sidechains could also create clashing incentive situations, and encourage competition, like for instance between sidechains with similar functionality.
More generic sidechains, serving as scalability solutions, would be easy to create (just clones, essentially), so would not require funding to get developed, and therefore could be fully reliant on the bitcoin currency, and not face the risk of clashing incentives with Bitcoin main.

Bandwidth and cpu processing get cheaper every year. There's no reason not to scale up gradually and allow as many people as possible to use the blockchain, and bypass third party intermediaries. 
A gradual increase in the block size limit every year would mean that in 20 years, the blockchain would be able to handle all of Walmart's transactions, just as the bandwidth requirements for hosting a full node that handles those volumes becomes affordable for the typical computer user to meet.
Growth beyond traditional retail, for instance transactions by autonomous bots, can be handled by side chains. We can move beyond relying on trusted third parties.

Development is not easy, so I don't blame you for not wanting to go back in the code and rework it.
It's just that Bitcoin's market cap is so much bigger than Dogecoin's, that I think it's worth giving Bitcoin users clearer donation options. Bitcoiners have shown a lot of generosity in the past. I created this spreadsheet that shows the total donated to just some Bitcoin-accepting organizations:
It shows over 10,000 BTC donated, which at today's value, is nearly $7 million. This doesn't include some major Bitcoin-accepting non-profits, like Sean's Outpost, which collected over $1 million in Bitcoin donations in 2013.
Maybe not now, but in the future, you could give a comparable bitcoin deposit address section, where something like this is served to the user:
DEPOSIT Bitcoin in your Receiving Address:

We don't want to catch the bad actors at the expense of privacy, and dragnet AML monitoring violates privacy. 
Requiring merchants to implement AML measures would be an enormous drag on Bitcoin commerce, and totally eliminate financial transaction privacy. Consumers would need to reveal their ID to every merchant they purchase from using bitcoin, which would mean Bitcoin could no longer be used as a digital cash as it was intended. All of the advantages of Bitcoin, like seamless commercial transactions, no exposure to ID theft, and protection of financial privacy, would be eliminated if merchants were required to collect personal identification from consumers that paid in Bitcoin. This is just a monumentally bad idea.
There are already regulations in place on the use of cash to combat money laundering. Large purchases (over $10,000) are subject to reporting requirements. This is a more acceptable compromise between AML enforcement and privacy and could be applied to Bitcoin transactions.

It can still have use cases despite the flaws. For instance, people can deposit their bitcoins in sidechains for very short durations, make use of the functionality, and then withdraw.

There are many strategies for reducing the risk. It's too hasty to judge sidechains as totally useless IMO.

Increasing the 1 MB block size limit doesn't require a central authority either. Bitcoin does not have a central authority, as you control what software you install.

If we're going to deny this assumption, then it would only make sense to re-examine a lot of our rights, even suffrage. I don't prefer this route, which is why I think we need to be adamant about not consenting to regulatory oversight.


Allowing garage entrepreneurs to create and launch experimental services that don't meet your idea of good security standards, doesn't mean people are forced to use their services.

I agree, block padding is a good way to deal with the problem of miners refusing transactions to speed up propagation. One concern I have though is that it might not be worth the extra growth in the size of the blockchain. The padding is just junk after all. In the long run, miners refusing transactions for propagation speed purposes might not be a problem, as the block subsidy decreases, and miners become more reliant on transaction fees.


Leaving the block size limit in the hands of the developers leaves Bitcoin dangerously over reliant on a small number of people, and guarantees we'll have to deal with this problem again in a few years when we approach the 4 MB limit. I'd like a protocol level way of increasing the block size so we don't risk political conflicts in the Bitcoin community, which could lead to both paralysis, where the community can't agree on a solution, and, if a controversial hard fork is pushed through, fragmentation of the community.

Merge mining doesn't require non mining nodes to store each other's chains, just mining nodes.

The act of buying BTC, in order to acquire SC-coins, will only increase the value of BTC. And it is an act that is voluntary, and no one will be forced to engage in.

If you weren't a long time member of the Bitcoin community, I would be convinced that you were a troll. That is how much trouble I have relating to you with regard to your concerns about SCs.

The functionality will expand Bitcoin's ability to compete with altcoins (which you mysteriously refuse to acknowledge), and the code will be open source, meaning it can be reviewed, used and modified by anyone for free, etc.


That's exactly what an OS is. It's an Operating System to allow a human being to operate. The point is to give maximum optionality. Windows or Linux distros don't limit what you can install on computers running them. If you want a closed OS like jailed iOS, that's a different story, but I'd argue that's antithetical to the open source vision.
Beyond this tortured OS analogy, you have not given one reason why people having the OPTION to park their BTC in SCs, when they can already burn their BTC to create new coins in a one-way convertibility SC, or just burn them because they feel like it, and can gamble their coins with Trusted Third Parties, is somehow going to harm anyone who wants to continue using "sound money".

I'm not a dev, but from what the statement that MtGox released says, and the explanation that Gregory Maxwell provided, this was a problem in MtGox's custom wallet software, in not taking into account transaction malleability.
That the Bitcoin protocol allows transaction malleability has arguably been insufficiently communicated, because without being told, a site might expect only one transaction hash to be valid for a particular signature, but it's not a flaw, in that it doesn't make it impossible to securely verify which transactions went through.

The relevance of those posts have pretty much been washed away by the push to make the bit equivalent to a microbitcoin and the standard currency unit. When Bitpay announces support for the new 'bit' denomination, there are half a dozen posts about it on both  and bitcointalk.org, and several news articles on it, all assuming 1 bit = 0.000 001 BTC, it's counterintuitive to assume it means another value.


Millibit and microbit were used very little. They were shorthand for millibitcoin and microbitcoin, which were themselves rarely used.


'ubit' has its advantages but in my opinion 'bit' is better. But importantly, the momentum is already there for a change to 'bit'. Trying to create momentum around a new name is not likely to work but could squander the chance, in the push to switch to 'bit', to finally make the standard unit of account in Bitcoin a smaller denomination.

"The solution" (payment channels) has all of those issues I just complained about, so what are you talking about?


Your blaze attitude toward centralization runs counter to how important decentralization is to the Bitcoin vision.


Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin is what the majority of the core developers signed up for, and from what I know, still the general consensus. I want to see Satoshi's vision maintained, and not changed to a blockchain that costs a $30 transaction fee to record a transaction in. I don't want regular people who want to use Bitcoin to have to rely on centralized payment channel spokes, which become privy to large sections of their transaction history. I want them to be able to independently use the blockchain, at low transaction fees, as Satoshi envisioned when he designed and launched Bitcoin.

Side chains have one significant advantage, and that is that the bitcoins that remain to be generated would also be convertible into coins in the side chain, whereas an altcoin with a cloned distribution could only clone the bitcoin supply up to a certain point in time, with people who receive bitcoins after that date not being able to get an equivalent amount of altcoins.
Both methods have their strengths, and it'd be nice if both were created.

This is not at all the same. Other metals are not scarce. Gold and silver are scarce. People didn't just choose to value gold and silver for the hell of it. With Bitcoin's open source code, anyone can create a scarce cryptocurrency, so unless the market leader(s) has some other way to differentiate itself from clones, cryptocoins will see hyperinflation.
Now it's true that people might only choose to use one, or a few cryptocurrencies, but that's different than saying that an unlimited number of cryptocurrencies in contention doesn't pose a risk to the viability of Bitcoin-like currency.
If we accept that fragmentation does hurt adoption of cryptocurrencies at some point, then the question becomes, at what point?
Bitcoiners will say after 1, the original. Litecoiners, will say after 2 (gold and silver). Peercoiners will say after 3. And so on. I have a feeling it's 1.

Yes there is: they cost money.


I'm guessing no. And even if only a small percentage of transactions are better off without some or all of these ancillary services, that would still give Bitcoin a niche to fill. 


Their revenues can't be threatened by different payment method systems, because the entire financial system is controlled by them through a combination of their size and the financial laws in place. It's only a payment network that's entirely outside of traditional finance, and which has intrinsic advantages that compensate for its smaller network size, that can compete with them.

No, the use case I'm describing is someone buying from Walmart without using a trusted third party intermediary. 


It can't be done without doing on-chain transactions. If it could, we wouldn't need a blockchain.


I love the idea of using payment channels, but they still fall far short of on-chain transactions for many reasons. For one, they link all of your transactions together, thus creating a huge privacy liability. For another, they require parties to act as centralized spokes, that connects all end-users together. Centralization, even when the central party can't run away with your funds, comes with all sorts of problems, and makes an economy more fragile.
$30 transaction fees for on-chain transactions would mean a Bitcoin economy where individuals are locked-in to using whatever service they entrust their coins to, because switching-costs are so high. It's not the fluid, decentralized economy promised by Satoshi when he describes full nodes handling Visa-level transaction volumes.

Here is some more information about how it can prevent 51% attacks by pools:
The miner would periodically scan the blockchain. I think the following would help it deduce whether it is participating in an attack:
* After a new block is confirmed over the block currently being mined by the miner, work is not updated (the miner is not given a new block to mine) for more than 30 seconds. 30 seconds should be more than sufficient for blocks to be verified by all nodes.
* The prevhash (block the miner is mining upon) is not in the chain for more than 30 seconds.
* The block the miner is working upon is 2 or more blocks deep in the chain.
The first and third criteria help detect a double-spend attack, the second helps detect one of the cases of the so-called "selfish mining" attack (and also buggy pool software)

A currency is not any one idea. It's a neutral carrier of value. YOU choose what value it has.
The only non-subjective qualities of a currency, that you don't choose, are its features as money, like how widely accepted and held it is. Bitcoin has a bigger market cap than all of the copycats combined. If you want to get a lot of attention, then you should make Bitcoin the currency of the game.
Regarding confirmation time, there are two different types of confirmation in Bitcoin-based currencies: block confirmations and propagation confirmations.
A block confirmation is when a transaction gets into a network accepted block. In Bitcoin, this takes an average of 10 minutes.
A propagation confirmation is when a transaction is detected by the majority of nodes. This takes a few seconds to happen in all Bitcoin-based networks.
For most purposes, a propagation confirmation is sufficient. As long as the user is not able to immediately withdraw the bits they deposited, you can register their deposit as soon as you get a propagation confirmation.
Now, shorter block confirmation times are sometimes useful, but they come at the cost of miners with higher latency having a greater disadvantage, which encourages centralization of mining.
Furthermore, shorter block confirmation times give a miner attempting a 51% attack an advantage, because a miner building on their own blocks is not affected by latency, while the honest portion of the mining network is. The more latency there is, the greater the advantage of the dishonest over the honest.
People can buy Bitcoin in more places than all of the copycats combined. There are over $8 billion worth of bitcoin in consumers' pockets right now. You're significantly reducing the likelihood that these consumers will spend their coin with you by not catering to them, and instead favoring a nearly straight copycat with an insignificant market share and places where you can purchase it.
Finally, there is no reason that you need to be stuck using the 'bitcoin' denomination if you use Bitcoin. The 'bit' denomination, which is 1 millionth of a bitcoin, is becoming more popular, and this new standard is supported by one of the major players in the Bitcoin space:
In conclusion, please make your in-game currency revolve around Bitcoin!

Validators engage in transaction processing, ASIC manufacturers don't. The legal means of attacking validators are far more numerous than attacking hardware manufacturers whose products run SHA256, which can authorise a non-offending fork just as easily as an offending fork, not to mention be used in other applications not related to Bitcoin.
Furthermore, any portion of Ripple's validators being attacked would disrupt the network, and risk a network partition, unlike in Bitcoin, where an attack on a small portion of the network would not be enough to cause any disruption, because end users trust the longest chain rather than any particular node.
Bitcoin has the vast majority of venture backing, is actually distributed, and has innumerable groups working on related software that stand to upgrade it and its economy's capabilities: everything from wallets, to innovative exchanges, to distributed markets.
That Ripple's pumpers were able to hype a centralised network to unsuspecting investors to create a price increase on extremely low volumes means nothing. Ripple does not have the technical properties to disrupt finance. 


First of all, to claim Bitcoin is "tanking" is an absolute lie, suggesting your goal is not to provide honest criticism, but instead to smear Bitcoin using any means available. Second, that you think decentralisation doesn't matter to user experience shows you don't understand that it is resistance to regulation that makes a technology permissionless, which is what encourages innovation and keeps the cost of the service low.

It was wrong for Cody Wilson to advertise Dark Wallet as "money laundering software". This kind of reactionary article is exactly what you could expect from a statement like that.
The privacy protection features of Dark Wallet do not allow money laundering, and are required for mainstream Bitcoin use, not just for niche 'anonymous' wallets. A currency where anyone can deduce who you're sending money to is very dangerous to use, and not really viable, so better privacy protection is the natural next step in Bitcoin wallets.
Money laundering requires mis-identification of the source of income, and having non-traceable currency is no where near enough to allow that. Cash is anonymous/non-traceable, but there are still ways for authorities to figure out that someone is laundering money with it. Furthermore, CoinJoin and other Bitcoin privacy enhancements don't work well for larger transactions, so it's really only small purchases that can be anonymized in Bitcoin, which are a much lower priority concern for AML authorities. Large movements of funds, even broke up into many transactions, are very hard and expensive to make untraceable in Bitcoin, and that makes it a poor tool for money laundering.

To some degree, we have trust it to not allow certain levels of tyranny. If there were no restraint on a government at all, from the law or from the armed forces of other governments, it could prosecute end users all over the world, and even threaten/sanction/invade countries that allow users to run a distributed currency node. 
So yes, we can expect some restraint on the government. Even Bitcoin is not invincible, and can only work with some degree of freedom and restraints on government power. I think we can expect governments to have some restraints on them, and in my opinion, these restraints would preclude attacks against manufacturers of SHA256 ASICs.


ASICs do nothing except take inputs provided, and calculate a hash. The block headers are fed to the ASICs, which have no communication link that they could use to download alternate headers, so the only way I could see a state-level adversary attempt to sabotage Bitcoin through this kind of subterfuge is to force manufacturers to program a self-destruct that shuts all ASIC down simultaneously on a predetermined date, which is not the kind of attack that intelligence agencies would use in my opinion. And it would take one IC design engineer discovering the self-destruct module to avert the disaster for Bitcoin. Hopefully if Bitcoin becomes the backbone of a multi-trillion dollar economy, there will be more than a few IC design engineers inspecting the hardware providing its PoW. 


Well they currently rely on centralized exchanges, and we don't know if the new gateway systems will ever take over the centralized exchanges in volume. In any case, as we've seen with the Silk Road seizures, governments can come to acquire large numbers of coins.

I misunderstood you when you wrote:


I thought full nodes simply reject reorganizations. Anyway, I understand they weigh the number of transactions (perhaps taking into account 'days destroyed') in a chain to measure its correctness, but that again depends on there being a consensus on who controls which coins (if you don't know who controls which coins, you don't know which transactions are valid), which goes back to how you establish that consensus without trusted parties.
Then there is the problem that those who create transactions have the ability to create multiple versions, so that their transactions can be valid on multiple chains. The ability in POS to sign multiple chains without an opportunity cost opens up major problems that don't exist in POW.
I edited my last comment to add more information, so I don't know if you saw what I added. For your information:
I never argued they're impossible. I argued that they don't achieve distributed consensus. They're not secure against attacks on their central structure. If a currency ever becomes a serious force in the world economy, governments will seek to control it, and with a central structure, they will be able to. Right now they're eclipsed by Bitcoin, so no one of significance, particularly a government, cares about them. Bitcoin itself is almost too small for governments to care about. When considering the future though, one must consider how governments would react if these currencies had a real impact in the world.
All of Bitcoin's current weaknesses are a matter of its implementation, rather than inherent to its use of POW. As it matures, they can all be overcome. Mining pool software can be improved to remove the control pools have over chain and transaction selection in mining, P2Pool can be made scalable, ASIC manufacturing can be ramped up until ASICs are commodities that cost a little more than the raw material that go into them, at which point mining will be found anywhere cheap or free energy is found, etc etc. But POS is necessarily centralized, because without a trusted party being relied upon, it cannot maintain consensus.

It just provides bitcoin holders with more market options. Yea there will be scams, and private parties looking to profit of their particular sidechain, but that's how markets work. Bitcoin itself is rife with these kinds of profit seeking ventures. In the long run, an ecosystem is healthier for enabling and permitting all kinds of innovation and enterprise, and allowing individuals to make up their own mind as to what to use. The competition that occurs in a free market results in the wheat being separated from the chaff, and useful services coming to dominate and add value to the whole economy.

Yes, but you don't have to share your private key when you're paying with bitcoin, so you only suffer a loss if your own security is compromised. Not being vulnerable to the security mishaps of the companies you buy from is a major advantage.
That is not to say that the Bitcoin payment option, in its current state and with all things taken into account, doesn't have major disadvantages relative to credit cards.
Overcoming those shortcomings is a matter developing new services, business processes and software, which is no small task.

You really think the extra complexity of setting up mining software to merge mine is going to contribute in any significant way to mining centralization? Almost all mining now is done by pools or mining farms. They are already large operations that would have no trouble setting up merged mining. I don't see how mining centralization could get any worse because the software set up for mining gets a little more complicated. Most miners don't merge mine now only because it's not economical, because merge-mineable altcoins like Namecoin are worth so little. If side chains ever became a significant source of mining revenue, I'm certain all the pools and mining farms would configure their software to mine them.
Compared to the myriad of benefits from allowing sidechains and making bitcoin interoperable with other blockchains, this seems like a trivial concern.

And any attempt to regulate it would require modifying it from a decentralized network with fungible currency to one with centrally appointed gatekeepers that create different tiers of coins based on how 'clean' they are. That would immediately destroy Bitcoin's peer-to-peer structure, and increase the costs of using it, as those gatekeepers would be in a position charge a premium to validate coins.
I personally want Bitcoin to remain free from third party intermediaries, so that it can act as an 'electronic cash', even if that means certain countries' banking systems never embrace it. The very thing you describe as a 'bad thing' is what enables Bitcoin to circumvent the laws of repressive countries and keep the costs of using it near zero.

All of his points are addressed by myself or follow up commenters. His concern is SCs making mining more centralized because miners able to handle the complex task of setting up merge mining would be larger ones, and that would result in only large miners surviving if transaction fees from SCs are significant enough to make miners that merge-mine significantly more profitable than ones who don't.
The counter argument is that if SC transaction fees ever became significant enough to make single-chain miners uncompetitive versus merge-miners, there would be plenty of incentive for all miners to set up merge mining (which, relative to the entire task of setting up a miner, is not that difficult), not to mention to make mining software that makes it easier to set up merged mining.
Furthermore, mining is already centralized among large pools, who can handle the technical work of configuring their pool to merge mine, so the situation with centralization cannot get much worse than it is.


Because SCs would be much smaller, since they would be dividing the world's transactions amongst them. With only one chain, you would have a gigantic blockchain, that only parties with significant resources can afford to validate.


I explain why here:
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:51:16


Only 25 percent of GHash's hashrate comes from ASICs it directly controls. The rest come from remote miners who are pointing their ASICs at its pool.

@_date: 2014-12-14 14:48:41


Hundreds of validators is not a large group. It's a central structure that can be attacked, especially given they need to be mutually trusted, precluding their anonymity.
Ripple is a visible and vulnerable group of validators, making it brittle and easy to capture by state apparati. The centralized ownership distribution of XRP, revolving around the Ripple corporation, also makes it unappealing for various reasons.


Bitcoin is not at all reliant on centralized exchanges. The exchange of bitcoin for fiat is reliant on centralized exchanges, because fiat is reliant on trusted third parties. That's a shortcoming of fiat, not of bitcoin currency.


XRPs are totally reliant on the consensus established by Ripple validators, which are vulnerable to state takeover. People may as well use the current banking system. There is no comparison between this, and MtGox, which was just a company involved in Bitcoin, and not a part of the protocol.


That's totally false. It's useless right now, and the fact that it's used by a couple small banks just shows it's an extension of the current banking system, and not technologically disruptive. 


Bitshares is based on the flawed PoS consensus protocol, which is not capable of establishing secure and distributed consensus.

That was a thoughtful and measured talk. Two points he brought up that I want to comment on are:
[Tumblers- illegitimate and legitimate uses](
Lawsky mentions a legitimate use of tumblers, which is to keep the financial information of businesses private from competitors. 
I'd add that not just tumblers, but innovations that increase privacy in general, are necessary for the safe use of p2p digital currency. 
Exposed financial information on the block chain would give criminals a means of tracking and preying on individuals, making p2p digital currency much more dangerous to use.
An alternative of trying to give users partial privacy, through government-approved tumblers visible to LE (similar to the abandoned plan by US authorities in the 1990s to require all computers to use the Clipper chip for voice-data encryption) is not realistic, given the global nature of the internet and Bitcoin, the aversion to Chinese style internet firewalls in the US, and the damage to American innovation that trying to create a US-Bitcoin, separate from the global Bitcoin network, would cause.
P2P digital currency must become better at protecting privacy if its full potential is to be realized. A public block chain without privacy features to prevent tracking, while extremely convenient for investigations, is not viable or desirable when all factors are considered.
[Only regulating fiat &lt;-&gt; Bitcoin exchange would leave "gaping hole" for money laundering](
Lawsky presents the argument that p2p digital currencies are more suitable for money laundering than cash, and therefore limiting p2p digital currency regulations to exchanges, combined with growing usage of p2p digital currencies in commerce, might aggravate money laundering.
I would strongly urge regulators to consider the cost to innovation of trying to eliminate all potential negative effects of p2p digital currency before going down such a route. 
Innovation by its nature is often a double-edged sword, and trying to eliminate the bad would also eliminate all of its benefits.
The nature of the internet made some illicit activities easier to carry out, for example computer hacking, transmission of illegal information, including terrorist manuals, and the sharing of copyrighted materials.
The benefits of the internet greatly exceed the harm it facilitates however, and these benefits only exist because the decentralized and free nature of the internet was not trampled in an effort to eliminate its potential misuses.
In the same way, p2p digital currency might make some forms of financial crime easier to carry out, but the harm from this facilitation pales in comparison to its potential benefits. P2P digital currency needs space and freedom to grow so that it can revolutionize commerce and deliver these benefits. Old-fashioned police work, while not as easy as blanket regulations, should be the tool used to control its misuses.

The only thing holding Bitcoin back from exponential payment volume growth, and ultimately, mass adoption, is, in my opinion, the lack of an agreement on what to replace the 1 MB block size limit with.
It's hard to plan out a major push for merchant and consumer adoption when you don't know what will happen when transaction volumes reach 7 tps. For example, it makes it riskier for a company the size of Walmart to roll out Bitcoin payment integration nation-wide, because it could very well result in blocks filling up and fees for getting transactions processed rising dramatically.

I spent quite a bit of time looking at the donation options, and couldn't figure out how to send bitcoin.

Visiting the site without any other information, and seeing the D symbol of Dogecoin, and no Bitcoin option appearing even after I click the D symbol, I would automatically assume that only Dogecoin is accepted. That could perhaps be contributing to less being donated in Bitcoin..?

My position on Blockstream's commitment to create an infrastructure for massively scalable and decentralized transaction processing within the Bitcoin ecosystem is that on the balance, it is positive for Bitcoin.
Open source projects always face challenges in getting enough funding. This is why closed source projects often outpace them, and obtain the vast majority of users. Android is one of the few exceptions to this, and that's because Google, a for-profit company, has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into its development.
I see the millions in funding for Bitcoin development as an incredible opportunity to expand the first distributed consensus protocol, and the first chance humanity has ever had to create a practically incorruptible financial system. The risks of moving too slow, and failing to scale before Bitcoin's momentum runs out, or laws begin to be created to restrict it, I see as a much greater risk than a for-profit company being behind the funding.

1) We already have pools dominating mining, so it won't change things from how they are now. In the future, miners and pools can switch to the GBT pooled mining protocol, which would decentralize mining by taking the power to select transactions/forks away from pools.
2) Side chains are an additional option, so it's not a big problem if they are less than perfect. They're like an intermediate solution between trusted third parties and the main chain. It's better to have them as an option, even if they're less than perfect, than not.

Ok here's my feedback:
I really think you should focus on Bitcoin. It probably doesn't make a big difference either way (the success of the site will depend much more on other factors), but I think having Bitcoin as the main label for the donation button would make it more accessible to the general population.
This is especially the case as 'bits' are becoming the most common microdonation denomination in Bitcoin (a 'bit' is 1/millionth of a Bitcoin, or 1 uBTC). It's now a lot easier, psychologically to donate small amounts of bitcoin, or 'bits'.
Regarding those 'other' factors: I really like the look and feel of the site overall.
I think you should provide more visible tabs for new users showing where the main sections of the site are, and provide more instructions on what they should do. It might be obvious to someone who's tried the site a few times, but it's crucial that as high a percentage of new users as possible stick around long enough to become long-time users.
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:48:40


I didn't ask you for examples, I asked why you think they can't compete in general. It seems like you deliberately chose an edge case where SCs can't compete, to dispute the entire notion that SCs can compete with altcoins. Why not address the case that applies to the majority of altcoins, which don't have features, like perpetual inflation, that a SC can't emulate?
I just don't understand your insistence on looking for excuses to denounce SC, rather than objectively evaluating them, and being honest about their potential benefits.


No, I did not say it will eliminate altcoins. But why do you dismiss all of the altcoins that SCs will be able to compete against? I just don't understand why you ignore this. Can you explain why you think it's such a low priority to you?


I've already addressed this tired old "sound money" canard, so I'm just going to repeat myself, since that's all you seem to be doing:
It doesn't break anything in Bitcoin proper. Use of SCs will be 100% optional and the Bitcoin blockchain will continue working exactly like before, if anything with more security from having more hash power being dedicated to it through merged mining.
SCs give BTC all of the benefits of altcoins without any of the disadvantages.
Giving Bitcoiners the option to use SCs to use a new feature, does not negatively affect Bitcoin proper, or those who choose to never use a SC. You want to control other people's choices, and prevent them from using a new feature without having to buy into an altcoin, and falsely label this as "sound money". 
Your advocacy against SCs is extremely harmful for the Bitcoin ecosystem, and is based on flawed arguments.

True, there would need to be controls to prevent/neutralize that. 
For example, the private key could be stored on a tamper-resistant hardware device that destroys the private key upon an attempt to access it, or upon use. If a thief gets access to the device, they would not be able to copy the private key, and would not be able to use it without revealing to the real owner that their device was compromised.
If a voter discovers that their device has been stolen/compromised, they would go to the electoral body and request that the public key linked to their identity be changed, and the body could change it.

My concerns might seem ridiculous in the context of today. It's hard to imagine any government approaching a site hosting a blockchain explorer and demanding they offer a hash of a forked chain for download, while running a network of sybil nodes that propagate the fake fork.
But I'm envisioning a time when a cryptocurrency, say Bitcoin, is one of the major currencies of the world, and the primary vehicle for international fund transfers. In a scenario like that, there will be intense attention on the parties that establish the consensus, and major operations being launched against them, to control how this new financial systems operates, is not unimaginable. Most people will not be running full nodes, and will either have to trust the full nodes they connect to, or download a hash from a trusted source and check it against chain the full nodes are hosting. The reliance on trust is a point of vulnerability, that I see being exploitable by a determined adversary with global reach (e.g. a coalition of government of major countries).

The problem is lack of opportunity cost in voting through PoS. Miners can try a practically unlimited number of configurations of votes without incurring an opportunity cost, before actually casting their vote, when voting is done by providing proof of stake. This is fundamentally different than proof of work based voting, where discovering if a particular vote would be beneficial has an opportunity cost.
Adding complexity and coming up with different variants of PoS doesn't eliminate this problem of lack of opportunity cost.

Just because I can't list every possible problem with centralization doesn't mean my dislike for it is "blind". There could be rational reasons, based on sound systems design principles, for preferring a Bitcoin economy not totally reliant on centralized parties for the vast majority of its operations. 
The accumulated experience of hundreds of years of economic activity I believe has shown that centralized parties tend towards being corrupted and captured by the organs of the state, and that this leads to higher costs and restricted access. I believe this record indicates that these failures are inherent to centralization, rather than a result of just poorly implemented centralization.
My reference to Satoshi was more to do with making the point that the original development road map for Bitcoin was to make it highly decentralized, and that there has been no consensus to move away from that, so if you want a future Bitcoin economy heavily dependent on multi-sig OT pools and nLockTime payment channels, the burden is on you to convince everyone, not on me to convince everyone to keep the course.
So far neither of these have been proven to 1. protect privacy, 2. escape regulation, 3. be low cost
And finally, I think a decentralized and highly scaled Bitcoin economy is possible in time. As technology improves and bandwidth/cpu-processing becomes more affordable, transaction volumes can increase without the number of active nodes dropping to levels that are unacceptably centralized.

* You said if an altcoin emerges that is better, and replaces Bitcoin, that's "life", implying not an undesirable outcome and not something Bitcoins should attempt to head off. After I called you out on this, you backtracked and claimed you don't want an altcoin to replace Bitcoin.
* You claim altcoins are scams, yet your business accepts them


Freedom is in optionality, not in denying people an option because you think you know what's better for them. Sidechains would be an option, that you want people to not have. You're against freedom and optionality.
Freedom is also the distributed currency having enough value to be able to compete with the fiat system, and for that digital scarcity is needed, and for digital scarcity, there needs to be a unified currency stock, not fragmentation across multiple altcoin blockchains with independent coin supplies. So supporting standardization of the cryptocurrency market around Bitcoin = supporting a free world where distributed currency can compete with fiat currencies with government monopolies.

@_date: 2014-12-30 23:18:05


Yes they do. They are not altcoins. They use the same coin supply as Bitcoin. They preserve the digital scarcity of the 21 million bitcoins. 
They are also interoperable with Bitcoin, through their p2p conversion mechanism, which makes sidechains effective extensions of the Bitcoin blockchain. The interoperability counteracts the breakdown of the network effect that comes with the market being divided across multiple blockchain.


The bitcoin currency can effectively make use of new features when the Bitcoin blockchain obtains sidechain functionality. 


There is a major risk that new altcoins, with new features that Bitcoin doesn't have, will take market share from Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is not able to quickly adopt their features. This would harm the value of bitcoin currency.
It's blindingly obvious that enabling sidechains that can allow bitcoin currency units to effectively be used in other blockchains with different protocols will allow Bitcoin to maintain its market advantage in the midst of innovation.
The alternative of relying on Bitcoin main to do a hard fork and incorporate every new feature that comes along, and quickly enough to head off a loss of market share, is extremely fragile.


I explained why it's better to use Sidechains via an edit, that you may have missed:


And finally, my question:
Putting all of this aside, why do you oppose people having the option, yes **option**, to use a feature that has no technical effect on the Bitcoin blockchain? No one would be forced to use this option. Why do want them to not have the option altogether?

It doesn't break anything in Bitcoin proper. Use of SCs will be 100% optional and the Bitcoin blockchain will continue working exactly like before, if anything with more security from having more hash power being dedicated to it through merged mining.

Yes, government censors could cause major problems for a PoW currency too, but the problems are not as severe, for two reasons:
* Existing users of a PoW currency are not affected by the censoring of uncensored wallet download sites, as opposed to a PoS currency, where existing users that do not turn on their wallet in more than a year are affected by the censoring of checkpoint provider sites.
* A PoW currency can be accessed with SPV clients, so the majority of people do not need to rely on easily censorable e-wallets, whereas there  is so far no known way to make SPV clients for a PoS currency.
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:21:21
The only denialism here is your denial of the fact that you cannot have a distributed and secure blockchain without an external gauge on trustability, like PoW. It is the only solution ever come up with to the decentralized consensus problem.


A blockchain that relies on social consensus and regular trust-based checkpointing can be attacked and disrupted much more easily than a PoW-based blockchain. It's not a robust enough basis for a global economic backbone.


I have no financial motive to defend an inferior model, as I can always buy into the superior model. I believe PoS is deeply flawed because of the underlying reliance on a trust network.

Proof of stake is not secure. It can only be made secure with checkpointing by a trusted third party. Delegated Proof of Stake has the same problem.

They can't. I'm glad I could clarify that for you. They can only decide what transaction goes in their own block.

True, however, there's another problem that MM SC functionality does fix, and that is that with a single blockchain, to contribute at all to transaction validation, you need to validate the global aggregate of transaction data. With SCs, this is no longer the case. 10 blockchains each with 100 tx/sec will have more validators than 1 blockchain with 1000 tx/sec, because a larger set of individuals have the resources needed to take part in validation when transactions are split into a larger number of smaller blockchains.

The majority will converge on using a few trusted nodes. Any source which acquires significant mindshare will become a target of legal action in an attack scenario. Getting an uncensored hash would be like downloading a pirated movie: very possible, but not convenient or easy for non-tech users. Some governments may be able to migrate their users to a forked chain by controlling several trusted sources.
And then there's scalability. PoW allows SPV clients, which is an intermediate solution between using hosted wallets and running a full node, that is much more secure than the former, and much less resource intensive than the latter. Bitcoin's PoW mining network can also be used to secure sidechains through merged mining, allowing for practically infinite scalability at decent levels of security.

Using Bitcoin's decentralized network for p2p (no intermediary) transactions at Walmart is a use case. 
P2P transactions are different than transactions through a trusted third party. You seem to not see any value in p2p transactions over those that take place on the ledgers of TTPs. That doesn't mean others don't, or that it's not a use-case.

A [proof of work transaction type]( Enabling POW transactions would allow DACs (Decentralized Autonomous Corporations) to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. 
This would allow an unlimited number of alt-chains to be created with BTC backing their value. It would enable regional sub-chains, or fast-block blockchains, with BTC-backed currency, for example. It would allow blockchains used only by miners, that work as nodes within a P2Pool. This would allow miners with much lower hashrates to participate in P2Pool and still receive payouts with low variability.

Wait, you're suggesting that a blockchain is either an altcoin or it's Bitcoin, and that there is no other category.
The standard definition of a blockchain with two-way convertibility of currency with the Bitcoin blockchain is a 'sidechain'. It's neither an altcoin nor Bitcoin. It can be thought of as a blockchain that's interoperable with Bitcoin, and seeds its money supply with suspended bitcoin instead of with mining.
It's unique, and has many qualities distinguishing it from an altcoin.


First of all, 'Bitcoin' with a capital B means the blockchain and network. The currency is 'bitcoin' with a small b.
The answer to your question is no, but the bitcoin-backed currency on the sidechain is, well, backed by bitcoin. It doesn't have the full security of bitcoin units obviously, but it does leave the user with the option to convert their sidechain-coin back to bitcoin, and which, unless the sidechain is extremely insecure, will mean the value of the bitcoin-backed coin will remain close to that of a bitcoin.




I think that this is likely the case, but I don't think the risk of an altcoin with new features taking market share from Bitcoin is negligible enough to dismiss as you are doing. It's a large enough risk to make it worth taking action to give Bitcoin a means of incorporating, via sidechains, new features into its ecosystem in order to keep it as competitive, feature-wise, with new altcoins as possible.
Also, you have not addressed scalability: sidechains allow Bitcoin to scale without relying on TTP payment intermediaries like Coinbase that are extremely vulnerable to regulatory capture.


So to clarify, you want a technological innovation to not be developed, because you don't want people to use what you believe to be an inferior model.
Whereas I want people to have as many options as possible, because I don't know everything, and it's possible that someone will think of a way to derive value from sidechains that I haven't imagined. I also trust that the free market will move away from bad models, so that those sidechain implementations that are harmful and don't add value will sooner or later have a small usership and little overall impact.
Finally, considering your business is compatible with altcoins and courts altcoin users, your claim that we should be concerned about conflict of interest in the decisions of Blockstream founders applies even moreso to you. Someone who relies on altcoins for his business might not want to see a technology that reduces their market share.

I don't see where this "paper worth tens of millions of dollars" comes from. It was an application form to open a bank account. And maybe he didn't know that making a single mistake on the application could mean he would potentially face years in jail. 
He also wasn't filling out a form from the federal government. It was a form from a private bank, although perhaps with various regulators outsourcing their enforcement and policing to banks, that distinction has blurred.


It's overkill. There should be no prospect of jail time for not filling out a form correctly. Doing ordinary business activities like opening a bank account or making a purchase shouldn't be so precarious and scary.

No, sidechains allow virtually infinite scalability at I believe is better than TTP security, though of course below main chain security.
The data overhead per sidechain for the Bitcoin blockchain is minimal, while allowing for a significant percentage of transactions to be offloaded from the main chain.
To understand why it improves scalability, you have to consider that people do the vast majority of their transactions with parties that live in the same region as them. This means that people get nearly the same utility they get now (e.g. 90%) with regional blockchain that only store regional transactions, which constitute a tiny fraction of global transactions. Now with this in mind, consider that with sidechains, people can store and run a sidechain node for their particular region with minimal computing/bandwidth resources, the result of which is that ordinary people, with consumer grade computers and internet connections, will be able to share in the burden of validating and propagating the world's transaction data.
The result is a vastly more decentralized and efficient allocation of transaction data, where the job of storing the world's data is split between people living in different regions, with the people of each region storing the data they're most likely to use.

Bitcoin's Gini coefficient has been steadily declining since it started. Your assumptions about how Bitcoin is evolving are wrong.
Why Bitcoin works is that it's open source and decentralized, so those with more wealth cannot hold a section of the market captive with proprietary gated networks. This means that over time, as the holdings of the early adopters are spent, they're only replenished if they add value to the economy, which is challenging. This is why wealth inequality among Bitcoin holders has been decreasing. 
Bitpay can continue dominating the market if it offers the most competitive rates and best technology. It's installed base gives it no advantage in finding new customers.

Yes, it definitely gives Bitcoin value. Every CP transaction requires producing a Bitcoin transaction (since it is encoded in a Bitcoin transaction), which requires acquiring BTC to pay the transaction fee. The greater the demand for CP services, the greater the demand for BTC.

This essentially uses the simplified payment verification (SPV) security model, which Bitcoin thin clients like Multibit use, for the security of the BTC backing the side-chain.
The first person to propose this, that I'm aware of, is TierNolan: 
I independently came up with a similar 'proof of work transaction' proposal, which would also enable BTC-backed sidechains:
I think the proof of work transaction is a simpler way to implement this. This way the Bitcoin network doesn't need to validate a long chain segment of block headers for every 're-animation' transaction. All of the information that needs to be validated is encoded in the special Bitcoin address where the BTC are suspended, and in the single block header from the side-chain which the re-animation transaction publishes.
What I envision with these side-chains is people holding a small percentage of their BTC in them, and using them for  the majority of their transactions. The more secure Bitcoin main-chain would be used for long-term savings, while each region would have its own Bitcoin side-chain, containing primarily transactions between people living in the same area. 
This way you could store a very small side-chain on your computer/phone, that would contain the transaction data that is most relevant to you, as it would be for the coins held by people living close to you. The guy living in Australia would have his own BTC-AU side-chain, which you don't need to also store (assuming you live outside AU). When you two want to transact with each other, you would use the main BTC blockchain.

The adversary can buy coins, sell them, and then use the old private keys. 


If it's a global currency, I think there's a reasonably high chance that the vast majority of people don't run full nodes, and rely on heavily regulated e-wallets.

If that's fair, then what's unfair about offering the product at a price that someone is not able to buy it at?

They can effectively ban Bitcoin in the US, by making it illegal for merchants to accept Bitcoin payments without collecting identifying information from the customer, or requiring the coins to come from corrals controlled by gatekeepers. This would neutralize the cash qualities of using bitcoin in the US, and make it like any other third-party controlled payment system, with the added disadvantage of the underlying currency being volatile and not very liquid.

That's exactly my point: the other POW coins don't innovate. Using a different proof of work algorithm doesn't change the competitive dynamic of mining, which will tend to lead to large pools and specialized miners.

It will also boost innovation by providing a better launch pad for new blockchains, since the value of the currency they use will be backed by bitcoin.

Your view on a pegged currency is yours alone, and doesn't give you any right to deny others the ability to use them. Why is it that you want to deny others the option to use something they personally find valuable?
It could be because you're actually an advocate of altcoins, and don't want Bitcoin to have the ability to outcompete emerging altcoins by incorporating their features into its ecosystem. You [said it yourself](


Most Bitcoin stakeholders don't like the idea of Bitcoin rapidly losing value as an emerging altcoin begins to take its market share. You should disclose the fact that your views on this possibility sharply diverge from that of most Bitcoiners.

I suspect that the main chain is guaranteed to be larger than any sidechain, irrespective of how many trillions are poured into the latter, due to the benefits that accrue to the main chain from activity on SCs, which are similar to an indirect tax.
Other than the central position of the main chain in a SC ecosystem, the main chain also benefits from being where the vast majority of coins will be held, due to its inherently greater security, which will lead to transaction sizes, and by extension fees, always being higher on the main chain.
I guess we can't really prove either case, as it's all conjecture, but that's my 2 bits. I think the benefits of adding SC convertibility to the Bitcoin protocol, in allowing Bitcoin to acquire innovative protocol features with minimal risk, far outweighs any potential risks.

No, that is not how it is going to work. You're completely neglecting the fact that SC-coins would be fully convertible to and from BTC and only come into existence by transferring BTC into a SC. The price of a fully convertible SC-coin could never diverge from the price of BTC, because it would be irrational for anyone to pay more for BTC than the market price of an SC-coin, or pay more for an SC-coin than the market price of BTC, when they can just buy the lower priced counter part and convert it into the version they want (either BTC or the SC-coin).
What this means is that SC-coins will act as representations of BTC. When people are buying SC-coins, they are actually just buying BTC. This cannot possibly dilute the value of BTC. There will be 21 million BTC, spread out across the MC/SC ecosystem.
And in addition to that, there will be new demand for BTC, because there will be use cases for particular SC-coins that vanilla BTC can't meet. This attracts BTC buyers who otherwise would not have bought BTC. 
How you could look at this, and not realize that SC-coins are purely positive for BTC value, I don't understand. Maybe you just hadn't considered the implications of SC-coins being generated from BTC, and convertible back into BTC..?
As I said before, SCs have all of the benefits of altcoins (space to experiment with new functionality, splitting the burden of transaction validation into smaller, more easily manageable blockchains), with none of the disadvantages (no dilution of BTC's value, no fragmentation of the market between incompatible blockchains). 


After getting details about Blockstream and its plans in the AMA, and knowing who is behind it, I have no concerns. Of course, we have to judge every action by its own merits, and stay vigilant, but I see nothing to be concerned about in Blockstream developing open source side chain functionality that stands to greatly expand BTC functionality and scalability.

No it absolutely doesn't prove his blanket characterization that bitcoin enthusiasts only spend bitcoin for media attention. 
The assertion he made is impossible to prove, which is why it's silly and disingenuous to make it. It's the type of insulting comment the OP regularly makes in this subreddit, and then absurdly claims he has proof for.
To elaborate: 
Higher sales in the first month of a large retailer accepting bitcoin than the following months could suggest that many bitcoin users spend more than average at a company soon after it begins accepting bitcoin, but it doesn't prove it. It also doesn't prove that every bitcoin user follows this spending pattern, and definitely doesn't prove that every bitcoin user spends bitcoin solely for media attention.
It's one thing to point out "Overstock's bitcoin sales decreased after the first day, and we don't have data showing how the sales are doing after the first month. It's worth looking into this more to see how much bitcoin contributes on a sustained basis to the bottom line of the average retailer that begins accepting it". It's another to use this single (or a handful of) datapoint as the basis for the claim that "bitcoin users only spend bitcoin for media attention!" The latter is absolute nonsense. It's nothing but trolling and slander against Bitcoin users in general, that others, in their good-nature, don't realize and mistakenly believe is harsh self-criticism. (edited for clarity)

Bitcoin is technically as good as any of its forks. There have been no clear advancements over Bitcoin in any of the altcoins. I think you're overstating the ease at which the Bitcoin infrastructure can be adapted to work with altcoins. There are dozens of Bitcoin clients, services, etc that have not been ported over to any altcoin, and not just the closed sourced ones. It takes time to modify software to make it work with a new coin, and maintain its compatibility with that alt. Closed source software would be even harder to replicate for altcoins, as it requires the support of the software maker.
The network security of Bitcoin also gives it a clear advantage over smaller forks, which amplifies its network effect.

This is an incredibly well formulated analysis and a very valuable contribution to the public knowledge base.
One thing I'd add is that eight individuals setting monetary policy at the Fed by fiat, because they were appointed to those positions, is different than eight individuals owning fabrication facilities that produce the bulk of ASICs, because they are able to produce them more efficiently than other producers and potential producers.
The composition of the top ASIC producers will always be fluid, because manufacturing ASICs is an apolitical activity, that anyone is free to engage in. The leading ASIC manufacturers will be optimized by the market to weed out those who produce devices harmful to the Bitcoin network, simply because those buying ASICs won't want them.
I also don't see a risk of ASIC manufacturers surreptitiously adding components to the devices that are able to take control over them and use them to launch a 51% attack. ASICs do a very simple operation: SHA256. I imagine it would add a significant amount of complexity to the device to make the ASIC capable of doing much more than that.

In the example you gave, greedy miners stole the bitcoins through a hashing attack, not an exploit of some bug in the pegging mechanism.

In other words, all sidechains will not be equally vulnerable to hashing attacks.

Calling it a 'side chain' in no way makes it sound "equivalent to Bitcoin". It's called a 'side chain' because it has a connection to Bitcoin, in the two-way convertibility. It's perfectly clear terminology, and widely adopted, and you're making up an excuse to call it something else to make it sound like it's just another altcoin with no special characteristics that make it better for the Bitcoin ecosystem.


Yes, altcoins allow scaling by splitting up the load of validation amongst multiple blockchains, but they are not a viable way to scale because they cause an effective inflation of the cryptocoin supply. Side chains meanwhile have the same beneficial effect on scaling, but WITHOUT the inflation. It's blindingly obvious that this is good for the Bitcoin ecosystem.


I think it's you who has no idea how valuable it is. We have infuential members of the Bitcoin community like Peter Todd that lobbied against raising the block size limit for nearly two years. I don't know what his current position on the block size limit is but there will undoubedtly be people who oppose raising it, or oppose anything but the smallest increases.
Finding additional ways to scale is therefore of the utmost importance, and sidechains is an excellent way to do.
Furthermore, the total number of people running full nodes is of vital importance to Bitcoin's decentralization, and this number can be increased (without introducing the inflationary effect of fragmenting market share across altcoins) by splitting the load of bitcoin and bitcoin-backed currency transactions across multiple blockchains. 
Sidechain functionality would undoubtedly be of huge benefit to the Bitcoin ecosystem.This is all so obvious to me that I am having difficulty understanding how someone who is seemingly intelligent and able to articulate stances on cryptocurrency concepts can't see this.


That is not what's being proposed! You're the one speculating about some future change being made to the Bitcoin blockchain that "requires" you to use a sidechain. I'm supporting the sidechain proposal as is, while you're pumping FUD about some imagined sidechain proposal that you speculate might one day be forwarded.


This is straight FUD and disinformation. Use of sidechains would be 100% voluntary (under the proposal forwarded, not the non-existent proposal you're spreading FUD about), and the functionality would have no effect on the Bitcoin blockchain.
It would increase the freedom and optionality of Bitcoin users in every way, while potentially giving the Bitcoin ecosystem a much more effective tool for competing against altcoins with innovative new features (a competitive risk you handwave away, inexplicably) than the risky/difficult hard fork method it currently has.

Many people in the NXT forum have a significant conflict of interest wtr to issues like this. An assessment from an independent party would be much more useful.


Once the knowledge is made public, everyone can access it if they seek it out. It's not Satoshi's fault that most people weren't searching for a p2p digital currency when he first released it, or when they did come across it, dismissed it.
The requirement to have equipment doesn't mean it's not impartial. Everyone's equipment is treated the same by the protocol. All the protocol cares about is how many hashes you create per second. No one gets preferential treatment based on any factor but hashes per second. That's what makes it impartial.


In the sense that I'm using the word, it was impartial, because no one needed permission to get the coins, and all hashes were treated the same by the protocol.


There has been very little independent analysis of NXT's security model, so it can't even be effectively critiqued at this point. Is it totally decentralized? Is it pseudonymous? These are questions that I haven't seen answered in an independent analysis.

Corroboration from a credible independent source is a pretty normal standard for considering something as true. Until I see a credible assessment verifying it's open source, I don't trust claims to the contrary, and I would urge others to not do so as well.


There isn't one notable independent party who's done so? Also, it's not just a matter of one release having its code released publicly. It's also a matter of on what schedule the code is released. Open source projects release it immediately, and typically do most of the work by making changes to a public repository, rather than behind closed doors and then releasing it when it's ready. Whether NXT does this remains to be verified by someone credible.


NXT's creator got all the BTC paid for the NXT. That's giving someone a privileged position as generator of the coin.

How would this work? The &gt;50% attack to be concerned about is against the sidechain, and would happen after the reanimation transaction has occurred on the main chain.

It's fixed regardless of whether people are free to burn their bitcoin (as they are now), or free to gamble their bitcoin on a SC that could fail (as they would be with SC functionality). That's not going to change. 
We know that with decreases in supply, prices generally increase. This is an iron-clad economic law, that's governed by increasing marginal utility with growing scarcity. 
Now of course, I don't know everything, and no one, including me, can predict the future, but I believe that it is extremely likely that on the whole, based on the various reasons I've given, that it would be good for bitcoin to have a new avenue to compete with altcoins with its native currency, and to be able to scale without increasing the resource requirements of full nodes, via SC functionality.
All changes require taking a chance, which has the potential to mitigate some risks, and increase others. I think the risks that SCs mitigate are far far greater than the risks that it increases.

Blockstream is developing open source side chain functionality, which will allow Bitcoin to scale to practically infinite levels. Bitcoin is limited right now. A project to expand its capabilities is not scary, it's necessary. The fact that several core devs are onboard makes it more likely that the difficult to obtain consensus will be reached to add side chain functionality. 
What's the alternative? 
Keep Bitcoin limited to 1 MB of transaction data every 10 minutes, meaning no more than a few thousand people can use it daily?
Hope that Bitcoin develops into an expensive international wiring service, that you need to pay a $30 transaction fee to use? Where the little people are forced to use trusted third parties (bitbanks) or hope that yet to be developed and highly theoretical nLockTime payment channel networks will supplant the need for bitbanks?
Bitcoin needs to be scaled up, preferably by both raising the block size limit and adding side chain functionality. Not doing so is just delaying the inevitable, which is a world that uses distributed consensus to establish the order of digital transactions, while also making it more likely that an altcoin will supplant Bitcoin, or worse, fragment the cryptocurrency market and thus threaten its digital scarcity and ability to achieve the critical mass needed for widespread adoption.

I think it's more accurate to say they're 100% backed by bitcoin. The backing is only as good as the hashpower securing the sidechain. Bitcoins I think should refer only to the units of currency on the main chain, as they're more secure than a bitcoin-backed sidechain coins.

You argued this above:


While your concerns and solutions are all based on "what if". "What if":
* fees from side chains are sufficiently large to change the incentive structure of mining
* transaction volumes on side chains are sufficiently large to change the cost of merge mining
* there are other solutions to scaling besides side chains
Meanwhile you dismiss all of these "what ifs":
* laws are created to restrict Bitcoin use before it scales, because we don't jump on the two most obvious solutions available right now: increasing the 1 MB block limit (which you started opposing nearly two years ago) and side chains
* P2Pool never gets off the ground, so your concerns about side chains encouraging pooled mining turn out to be moot
* Miners use GBT to source their block headers from a different source than the pool they use, completely eliminating the threat of centralization from pools
* P2Pool software is created that allows miners to merge-mine sidechains using pools, while mining the main chain with P2Pool, making side chains beneficial for mining decentralization, by reducing the size of the Bitcoin blockchain
* Having more validators, thanks to side chains, improves Bitcoin's decentralization
* Side chains allow experimentation with other, better scaling solutions, that otherwise would not be discovered and implemented into the Bitcoin main

Desire to help Bitcoin? If the federated P2Pool scheme gets a large enough percentage of the network hashrate, lower payout variance than the centralized pools? Not having to pay a fee to the centralized pool operator? Yes, they'll have to run full nodes, but thousands of people do that now, and I think there's a big overlap between them and individuals involved in mining, given the latter tend to be more technologically inclined and more deeply involved in Bitcoin than the average Bitcoiner.
I think the biggest incentive to use a centralised pool is the lower variance in payouts. That is why the vast majority of people choose to use larger pools over smaller pools despite both offloading the cost of running a full node to a third party. With mining variance reduced, I believe P2Pool mining would become competitive with centralized mining.
EDIT: WRT security, you're right, that needs to worked out. 
EDIT 2: How the security aspect could work is that the pool sidechains would reward poolcoins to two different groups: a small share (e.g. 1 percent) to those who mine the sidechain, and the rest (e.g. 99 percent) to those who contribute hashes on the sidechain's behalf to the Bitcoin P2Pool. That would give an incentive for the entire Bitcoin mining network to merge mine the sidechain, and secure it.

I don't have all the links that I've read on hand, and thus far, I'm not confident enough that my time would be well spent digging it up to do so for you.
It benefits BTC because it increases Bitcoin's hashrate. All NMC mining revenues come in addition to the BTC mining revenues Bitcoin miners already earn, so it increases the total revenues earned by Bitcoin miners. Any increase in mining revenue will increase the resources dedicated to mining, which is what network security in a PoW based distributed blockchain depends on.

It provided the Bitcoin market with an exchange in the first two years when there were no other real options.
It purchased and covered the losses of the Polish Bitcoin exchange, Bitomat.pl, after it was hacked, preventing its users from losing their deposits.

Increase the number of BTC alternatives in contention, and the value of all the incumbents has to decrease, with demand being held constant. Eventually, when demand plateaus (it can't grow exponentially forever), the growth in the supply of cryptocoins in contention could outpace the growth in the demand, leading to cryptocurrency constantly losing value and being seen as a poor store of wealth, and therefore a poor form of currency. 
Bitcoin haters are hoping this happens, and altcoins devalue Bitcoin and cause investors to abandon it. They point to the possibility of people creating copycats as the biggest flaw in the concept of decentralized digital currency.
Now it's true that Bitcoin forks can add innovation, in the form of new technical capabilities, and new marketing memes, but it's also true that they pose risks for the viability of cryptocurrency. Fragmentation does have risks, as [this comparison]( of Bitcoin to Linux on the desktop explains.

Again: Bitcoin can eliminate its reliance on large mining pools. Having to trust mining pools is not inherent to a PoW-based distributed consensus protocol.

You're calling my challenging your false accusation of me lying a "semantic argument". That's an interesting definition you have for semantics.
Post complete garbage attacking the other person, and when challenged, call it a disagreement over semantics.


The block size increase doesn't have to be large, and you can contribute to the hard fork being less risky, by promoting consensus, instead of promoting a network split.
There is also risk in depending fully on side chains, both because side chains might not meet all needs, and because side chains will take a long time to develop and implement, and there are risks in Bitcoin delaying mass adoption.
No one can know for certain how much risk each option entails, but the original development road map was to remove the 1 MB block size limit, so those who want to make it permanent have the burden of proving it's less risky than the alternative.


To cite a reference that I immediately corrected with an edit as evidence of my ignorance, and to attack this straw man of block size limit increases being "guaranteed" to track bandwidth costs perfectly or to fit ALL transactions, shows intellectual dishonesty on your part.

That was also my biggest concern with the single POW approach. I then thought that there could be a maturation period for the reanimations, in which the subsequent X number of POW transactions are all required to validate the POW transaction where the reanimation occurred.
If X is sufficiently high, then it will be less profitable for miners to act dishonestly than honestly. If there are further constraints on spending the POW UTXOs, like limiting the amount of BTC that can be reanimated in a single tx to a small percentage of the total BTC held there, and requiring POW txs containing reanimations to be spaced out by several Bitcoin blocks, it can be made quite secure.


My only concern with the SPV approach is the bloat it could add to the Bitcoin blockchain due to the size of the reanimation transactions. Most of that concern is now gone as you've explained it's possible to create compact proofs of total work in a chain of headers.

It in no way reduces the credibility of the main chain. It increases demand for the main chain. Billions of microtransactions per year that would otherwise be done with fiat currencies could be done on sidechains. The influx of capital into the Bitcoin economy as a result of all of this new utility added to bitcoin will flow mostly to the main chain, because due to the sidechain architecture, it would always be the most secure chain in the Bitcoin ecosystem, not to mention the most centrally located chain, connecting all sidechains to each other.

Proposed sidechains are not Bitcoin, they are separate chains that are interoperable with Bitcoin. If 100,000 BTC at a SC bitcoin address is 'stolen', there was no bug in the Bitcoin blockchain, only in the SC. As far as the Bitcoin blockchain knows, nothing was stolen, since the BTC moved exactly as they should according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. The security of a sidechain says nothing about the security of bitcoin on the main blockchain, and so cannot cause it disrepute. People will always distinguish SCs, which have known shortcomings, from the main chain.

It's hub and spoke, because users will want to be as close to the much more secure (as a result of benefiting from all merged-mining) hub as possible when using SCs. There will be competition for space as a direct SC of BTC, with outer rings becoming progressively less valuable.


I've addressed this above:

Operations auditing is not going to exist for Bitcoin, because it's an experimental technology that has no precedent. You're kidding yourself to think regulators are going to come up with cold wallet schemes for private keys.


assets are in place and in working order.
Financial institutions deal with traditional asset classes, not asset classes where ownership is dependent on exclusive knowledge of a private key, and the transfer of such ownership dependent on safe digital retrieval of that private key.


Thanks for your tedious nitpicking. Obviously what I mean is that there's no widely agreed upon idea of what the best practice is. In other words, there's no consensus on what the best cold wallet practice is. There hasn't been enough history of usage to have any confidence in any particular scheme. All schemes are best guesses at best.




Regulation is no such thing. Regulations on financial institutions deal primarily with 'paper' practices like accounting, not network or computer security.


Oh I'm "literally" arguing that!? Wow, tell me more! I'm arguing that regulators don't create regulations relating to advanced experimental technologies, other than banning or restricting their usage. They don't require specific technological practices to be used in the usage of experimental technologies.
This is fortunate. It would be very harmful for the Bitcoin economy to be tied it down to one set of cold wallet practices when it's at this very early stage when it's always evolving and improving.

What the data that is stored on a blockchain represents is beside the point. It can be data about assets, currency, land titles, etc. It doesn't matter.

Right now the block reward consists mostly of the block subsidy (25 BTC / blk). This means that for miners, transaction fees have very low value, and jettisoning them for a slightly higher chance of getting the block subsidy is a profit maximizing strategy.
If in the future, transaction volumes are 1000X current levels, and the block subsidy is substantially lower (consider: in only six years, it will be 6.25 BTC / blk), miners could be much more interested in the transaction fees, and consequently, more willing to relay large blocks.

For bitcoin to sustain and grow its current, very high price, it needs to do more than just get new large merchants to come onboard. That, and more, has already been priced in by speculators. It needs a massive increase in transaction volume, and indications from merchants that their bitcoin sales are rapidly growing.
The 1 MB block size limit needs to be lifted, and an intelligent and automatically scaling bloat control mechanism needs to replace it. Then the floodgates to mass adoption will begin. This, however, will take time. The core developers have been making all sorts of optimizations to enable Bitcoin to handle larger blocks without compromising decentralization.

We're not going to be able to force the powerful and influential to act transparently. If we were able to, then they wouldn't be powerful and influential. What actually happens is that they set the rules for who gets to see what information. The reason for that is that we have gatekeepers. The gatekeepers are easy for the powerful and influential to control. By distributing assets through technologies like Bitcoin, the powerful and influential lose their ability to multiply their influence through control of gatekeepers, leading to a more distributed power structure. 
By creating privacy tools that individuals can use, individuals are no longer forced to rely on trusted third parties to provide them with privacy, so that is one less class of gatekeepers that the powerful and influential can control to give themselves preferential treatment.
So we're not going to get rid of privacy. It will always exist for some. The question: for who? For those who control the gatekeepers? Or for everyone?

If illegal content is encoded in the Bitcoin blockchain, the only way to make it viewable for others is to also transmit to them information on where in the blockchain it is encoded and how to decode it.

Proof of Stake can't create a decentralized consensus. There's a reason why Peercoin has centralized checkpointing. 
As for centralization through pools, getblocktemplate can go a long way in reducing the power of pools, by returning the power to create blocks back to the individual hashers.

Oh great, this thread is being brigaded by trolls. 


No they won't disappear. 
First of all, miners cannot determine the average transaction fee. They can't just force users to pay more. They're in competition with other miners, and any restrictive block inclusion policy by one miner will simply mean others miners will take those transactions instead. So it's not a case where lower block subsidies will cause miners to decide to simply increase the average transaction fee.
Second, the only way Bitcoin survives after 21m coins have been mined is that transaction volumes are in the thousands (e.g. 4k) per second. At that rate,  miners will earn $24,000 worth of BTC per block, which is nearly triple what they earn today, on transaction fees only, assuming average transaction fees of 1 cent worth BTC.
And the minimum average transaction fee necessary to keep Bitcoin secure will only decrease as transaction volumes increase.

Moore's law and the corresponding growth rule in bandwidth are not optimistic. They're the trend line. Perhaps an approximation of the state of technology can be found in a value recorded in the blockchain, and the max block size can track it.
As for needing to increase the block size, I think increasing it will encourage people to launch initiatives to increase adoption by giving them a roadmap for how the technology will scale. Keeping the block size limit low might be a self fulfilling prophecy in that it discourages major pushes to increase adoption, thereby preventing transaction volumes from reaching the 1 MB block size limit.

So you want Bitcoin to not have the ability to run them out of the market competitively by incorporating their features via sidechain functionality? Is that why you obsessively campaign against a technology that is so obviously beneficial to Bitcoin?


Now you pretend you don't understand how hard it is do a hard fork? Even a feature that 90% of Bitcoiners see as beneficial will come up with a lot of opposition to a hard fork to incorporate. The point of sidechains is to provide a much easier means of incorporating useful features into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

More regular payments are also desirable, although the 5 or so times increase in the payment frequency of the largest pools (&gt;25% of total network hashrate) relative to medium sized pools (~5% of total network hashrate), may be of negligible value to a miner.

I don't see why we would want to balance the need of people to see high risk services eliminated completely from the market with the right of people to use high risk services if they want to. The choice should be the latter. 
The costs of putting well-intentioned regulatory requirements on Bitcoin business is that a service like mine, btctip.com, would not exist. That would be a net loss for our economy. 


What low trust economy? Bitcoiners aren't using fly by night exchanges. After three years of development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, that wouldn't have even been possible with the type of regulations that banks currently are under, we now have large exchanges that most of the Bitcoin economy relies on. We would have no Bitcoin economy and no exchanges had there been regulations on them from the start. Now that they they are large enough to afford to meet regulatory requirements, they already have extensive security measures in place.
I don't see a single reason why having regulatory requirements on companies in the Bitcoin economy would be good. 


I don't see any evidence that it's a good thing that regulators can choose what services we can and can't use. The mortgages you speak of are a perfect example. You can't just open a mortgage brokerage, because regulations, yet billions in shitty mortgages were generated. This isn't a point for the argument that we should be putting regulatory requirements on companies.


If you lose your money, that affects you, not me. I shouldn't be able to limit your investment options to those I consider low risk enough, based on the claim that your financial health affects me. What's next, limiting your vote because a bad vote has real consequences for me?


You're arguing that it's better in some cases to deny people the option of using a high risk service, for their own good, which does invalidate the basis of liberal democracy, which is that a person's right to make their own decisions trumps all other considerations. It's not a leap to go from taking away people's choices in the commercial world to taking away their choices, and even their vote, in elections. 


That's already happened, and will continue to happen, whether I approve of it or not. I don't think that it's a better situation than if regulators said they would forever leave Bitcoin businesses alone, but of course it's better than draconian regulations that cover the entire Bitcoin economy or Bitcoin being outlawed altogether.
I agree that reaching out to regulators and communicating with them, rather than shunning them, is constructive, but I don't think it's impossible to do that while arguing against regulatory requirements. People can disagree and still have an open line of communication and a cordial exchange.

But that is what we call a side chain. Why generalize the definition and make it harder for people to communicate about specifics? Side chains have a well established meaning that's distinct from what people mean 'altcoin' to mean.


In your example, where the chain has "dodgy code" and half the hashrate, it's obvious that it wouldn't be as secure as a bitcoin currency unit.
That is what I was responding to, hence the "obvious" descriptor.


I mean you didn't address how sidechains can improve scalability without increase the resource requirements of running a full node. This is extremely valuable to Bitcoin, and you made no comment on it.


How can you possibly run multiple blockchains, without two way pegging, whilst treating the currency stock in both blockchains as bitcoin?


But it does make financial sense to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It's blindingly obvious that it makes sense. It allows the Bitcoin ecosystem, meaning anywhere bitcoins, or bitcoin backed currency, can be used, to incorporate new features without obtaining the difficult to achieve community consensus for a risky hard fork.


No one would force you to use the sidechain coins. If you don't like them, don't use them.


What in the world are you talking about? You would not be required to pay anything.


You mean in that they help bitcoin currency better compete with altcoins, without forcing any user of bitcoin to use them?
People voluntarily using a technology having "economic ramifications" for you doesn't mean you have a right to deny them the option to use that technology.


The FUD is coming all from you. You're actually claiming that altcoin competition poses zero risk to Bitcoin, and that we should rely on the Bitcoin community being able to come to near unanimous consensus to do a risky hard fork on the main chain every time it wants to incorporate a new useful feature. You're claiming that we should block efforts to increase the functionality and scalability of the Bitcoin ecosystem by implementing sidechain functionality, because of some undefined risks that voluntarily using a technology that has no effect on the Bitcoin blockchain will pose to you.

Yes, you are partially correct, it is somewhat different than a 'trusted third party' acting as the custodian. In this case, miners are acting as the custodians. However, it is not completely prototypical. The level of support SCs have from miners can vary from SC to SC, based on the SC's popularity, the support it has from large pools and mining farms, etc.


It would only be devastating for Bitcoin if it was not properly explained that SCs are NOT Bitcoin, and the SCs are much more likely to fail than Bitcoin is to fail. However, if these facts are explained, then it would not be devastating for Bitcoin at all, since the failure would be properly understood to have not happened on the Bitcoin blockchain.

There is an objective answer, that's true, but there is not objective proof of an answer. Proof of work is objective proof, assuming &gt;50% of the hashrate is honest, and its distribution cannot be censored. Credible testimony from a trusted checkpoint provider, which a PoS cryptocurrency relies on, can be censored. It would be no problem for a techie to get around the censor and get the correct hash, but for the layman, requiring that kind of effort would dissuade them from using the cryptocurrency.
Then there's the possibility of old private keys, that no longer are worth anything because they no longer control coins, but that at one time controlled coins, being acquired by the attacker and used to produce a fork that censors prohibited transactions.

There are no technical ramifications given this can be implemented via a soft fork. As for economic ramifications: let's suppose they're bad somehow. Do you think that innovation should be stifled so that there are no negative economic repercussions for Bitcoin? I find that to be a Luddite position. Technology should move forward. If there are no technical risks to Bitcoin main, and if the use of Sidechains is entirely voluntary, then there's no reason to not implement this.
On the subject though, I find it hard to see how a rational analysis can envision the proliferation of altcoins that Bitcoin is unable to match in features via innovation due to a static protocol, to be less risky for Bitcoin economically than Sidechains that allow bitcoin currency to be utilized in new blockchain protocols that can experiment with any new feature.

Some people would be able to get the correct hash. It's not a case where any government would be able to shut down communication, and totally disrupt coordination between members of a cryptocurrency community. The problem however is that a significant number of people, especially outside of the techy core, can be prevented from easily getting the hash, or fed the hash of a govcoin fork through coopted sources. 
Just the fact that there are trusted sources that people need to rely on for the nodes to maintain a consistent global view makes PoS less credible, and not a worthy backbone for the world economy.
So far the cryptocurrency world has had next to no attention from governments. Even Bitcoin, which is by far the largest, has only had minor government attention. This would change if a cryptocurrency were a major part of global currency flows. A trust-based consensus protocol is simply too vulnerable to co-option to be used in this scenario.


We can agree to disagree. I think it could recover if it's credibly shown that the switch to the less vulnerable pooled mining algorithm has been completed. And I go back to my earlier point: any party capable of coopting all of major pools to launch a 51% attack would be able to do the same to the trusted nodes of a PoS network, and unlike with PoW mining, there no technical solution to neutralize this attack.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:10:34
If there were a way to ensure that nodes are giving an honest timestamp without proof of work, then there would be no need for the blockchain. The proof of work prevents a Sybil attack, which is needed to get a vote result not determined by parties without an economic stake in the success of the the currency.
tl;dr: Blocks authenticated by proof of work are the only known way to provide timestamping that is both decentralized and secure.

Hey why not regulate all businesses that hold BTC while you're at it, since you want to dictate how other people use their BTC, to guard against the 'systemic risk' of a major loss suffered by parties voluntarily choosing to risk their BTC in a SC?
This goes against everything Bitcoin stands for. If people want to gamble their own BTC at a SC, they should be 100% free to, just like they should be free to risk losing their BTC at an online casino. And from what we know about basic economics, any BTC lost at a SC will result in a boost in the value of other BTC holdings, by reducing the total supply of BTC.

If all the governments allow a Google-coin to exist that could actually compete with cryptocurrencies on all fronts, then we win. We'll have a secure, instant, digital currency that can't be censored or (with privacy-enhancing techniques) used to monitor us, with the added benefit of a stable value and automatic widespread acceptance. In other words, we'll have a free market financial system. And even with a Google-coin, there will continue to be demand for Bitcoin, or something like it, which does not face a risk of a future shutdown in the event of a change in the political climate. Meanwhile, while it's legal and in operation, the Google-coin would make buying and selling bitcoin very easy. 
But they won't allow a Google-coin with bitcoin-like properties. There is far too much regulatory baggage that can't be easily shed, and large corporations are extremely risk averse so will not risk flouting those regs.


I think something approaching a quarter of the military budget of the largest military alliance in the world is about right, but this is a wild guess.

Bitcoin (or some other cryptocurrency) would need 25 trillion transaction a year, at an average transaction fee of $0.01 worth of BTC, to have mining expenditures that approach $250 billion. That's 357 transactions per year, per person on Earth, or one transaction per person per day.

Mining can be done with small, cheap ASICs. Tx data can be sourced from any full node using the GBT protocol. Any attempt to censor mining, which is embarrassingly parallel and based on public propagation of digital information, will fail IMO. The only risk to digital currency technology is political climates developing that support banning its unrestricted use in commerce, and the best way to alleviate this risk is mass adoption.

You can trust the mining collective to tell you whether a tx is valid. Assuming &gt;50% of the network hashrate is not trying to defraud you, this will be reliable. Trusting majority hashing power is better than trusting a trusted third party bitbank to honor your bitcoin claim, because the block size limit prevents you from controlling BTC on the blockchain with your own private key.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:35:14
I don't know if it's actually 600X. It depends on how fast propagation needs to be. If it needs to happen in 1 second, then it would mean you need a broadband connection capable of transmitting 600X more data than the amount of tx data normally propagated per second, since there is an average of 600 seconds between blocks, and you need to transmit all of the txs propagated in that time span when a new block is generated in a O(n) scheme.

I also think it's probably possible to have one's own software do what Satoshi suggested, so there's no need to rely a third party payment processor.

One of the best ways to increase the full node count is to increase the size of the Bitcoin economy. It's not just the operating cost of running a full node that determines the number of full nodes in operation. It's also the number of people who have an economic interest in auditing the blockchain. Right now that number is very low because there are very few people involved in Bitcoin, relatively speaking. The way you increase that number is by increasing the size of the Bitcoin economy, and in a way where people are still directly accessing the blockchain. And for that, the block size limit needs to be raised.

"Fair business practices" doesn't mean giving the customer a service at a low price. It only means that they're not misleading the customer or otherwise defrauding them.
It's "fair business practices" as long as these money transmitters not forcing their competition out by pushing for more stringent AML/KYC regs (which WU is arguably guilty of. From what I understand, WU has been behind more stringent money transmission laws) and their customers are choosing to use them voluntarily (which in the case of WU is certainly the case). 


That people "need" these services doesn't negate the voluntary nature of the choice to use WU rather than a more expensive service. Yes, WU does have competition, but they offer a better rate, which is why people use them. Where they don't have competition, it's because they're the only ones making the necessary investment in manpower to extend their service to a particular region. The fair market price in this case is whatever people are willing to pay for this exclusive service.

If the network were processing 100 trillion txs per year (30X the TOTAL number of txs occuring globally every year), there would be hundreds of thousands of companies with the economic incentive to pay for a 1.7 GB/s broadband connection so that they can run a full node.

All Bitcoin needs to reach mass adoption is a hard fork to change the hard limit to something that can scale, IMHO.

Making Bitcoin an indispensable and ubiquitous part of the world economy is how you make it decentralised and censorship resistant. If it has hundreds of millions of users, it will also have tens, if not hundreds of thousands of full nodes all around the world. It will also have the kind of public buy-in that makes laws to ban its unrestricted use politically unviable.
A Bitcoin economy 1000 times bigger than the current one will also have orders of magnitude more smart minds looking at how to make it more resource efficient, and companies investing in designing affordable specialised hardware that run full nodes. A bigger economy produces more innovation, all of which contributes to network resiliency.
The idea that a hard limit that prevents people who want to use Bitcoin from using it will help keep Bitcoin decentralisd is a mirage. It's a justification invented for the hard limit ex post facto.

I absolutely don't want a central authority to decide on the block size. I advocate for an automatically adjusting block size, that either increases by a set percentage per unit of time, or tracks a value that's recorded in the blockchain which approximates technological capabilities (the most obvious being difficulty).
In the short run though, a manual one-time block size limit increase, through a hard fork, can act as a stop gap until the longer term, automatically increasing block size limit solution can be found (still no consensus on this).
Another option is to come to an understanding among miners to implement an informal block size limit, while doing a hard fork to eliminate the protocol level block size limit. That would jettison the need for another hard fork in the future to implement the automatically adjusting block size limit.


Referring to symmetric two-way pegged side chains with merged mining: Because they don't have a block subsidy like Bitcoin will be having for the next 80 or so years, and can be mined by Bitcoin miners at virtually no extra cost, which combined means that the cost of a double spend attack attempt against them by Bitcoin miners is minimal.

It's not outlined as a "massive problem" in the official sidechains whitepaper. What in the world are you talking about?


No they do not, that is the whole point of sidechains. If chains had to be aware of each other, there would be no point in having sidechains, since the nodes would have to be aware of all transaction on all chains anyway, so the transactions may as well all be on the Bitcoin blockchain which all nodes are aware of already.
You might want to take another look at the sidechains white paper and understand what you're advocating against.

If people follow these steps, the risks fall precipitously.
As for replacing the dollar, Bitcoin is not even close to the stage where that is a near-term possibility. If it ever reaches the stage where it's positioned to replace the government-issued currencies of large economies, then very safe savings options will exist, and they won't require the FDIC.

Bitcoin needs to scale up, by increasing the 1 MB block limit, and adding side chain functionality, as soon as possible, as there will be more efforts to restrict bitcoin use, as time goes on. Only ubiquity can protect Bitcoin.
If the internet had taken an additional 20 years to scale past a few thousand daily users, there's a real possibility we would need a license to run a server now.

It was a comparison/analogy that fails.


Given you're entrusting information to Reddit's servers, the analogy fails. If Reddit released an open source client that interacted with no central servers, then Reddit would be no authority, since it would not own the source code, and others would be free to modify it, and use the client without entrusting information with Reddit.


  
But I'm still going to dispute your use of the term "central authority" when describing developers who write open source code for a decentralized network.


That's a straw man. I said you're using the 'central authority' argument as an excuse. I didn't say you had no other reasons.


That risk will grow over time the longer the hard fork is put off. If it's permanently put off, and if you're wrong that side chains can act as full substitutes for the main chains, then Bitcoin will be permanently crippled and unable to reach its full potential.


I edited it to say "soft fork" immediately after posting. Still, you need to download software written by core developers, which is no different than downloading/installing a hard fork client that lifts the 1 MB block size written by the core developers, in terms of relying on your "central authorities". This is why I call your "central authority" argument against lifting the 1 MB block size limit an excuse.


That's a lie as a small increase in block size, or one that just keeps pace with CPU/bandwidth efficiency gains, would not cause a severe increase in difficulty to run a full node.

Perhaps you forgot the argument you made earlier:


The lower earnings/payout variance larger pools enjoy is such a major factor in determining which pool a hasher chooses that large pools already dominate mining, which your above quote suggests would be an undesirable outcome of larger blocks.
You can go through your post and mine again and actually make a consistent response to my argument.


Hashers don't run their own full nodes now. So this cannot be fixed by keeping blocks small.


Almost all hashers don't run a full node now to audit the blocks they're hashing on, so to preserve whatever negligible percentage of hashing power is being audited by the end-hasher, you're proposing keeping in place a major road block to wider adoption: the 1 MB block size limit.
I simply don't see any proportion or coherence in your logic for keeping blocks limited in size to 1 MB. You're proposing what I see as very poor trade-offs.

Your response doesn't address any of the following points that I touched on:
* address privacy (payment channels require all small transactions to be settled with a single transaction, preventing de-linking)
* the reliance on, and dominance of, large spokes (centralization) in a payment channel based payment landscape
* the high switching costs when on-chain transaction fees are $30
* Satoshi's original vision of full nodes handling Visa-level transaction volumes.


No there are not numerous ways to solve this problem. $30 transaction fees create problems that cannot be solved. On blockchain transactions were invented for a reason. The other solutions are not inadequate.

I like this proposed solution:




This could potentially reverse the centralization of mining devices by making the most economical mining that done by ordinary people utilizing the heat by-product of mining.
If that were to work (and that's a big if), that would still leave centralization through pools, which exists primarily because miners prefer reduced payout variance.
I believe 'pool sidechains' can largely solve this problem.
The idea would be this: 
You have several sidechains that exist solely for miners. Miners form P2Pools to mine their sidechain, and earn poolcoins, particular to their sidechain, while merge mining, on behalf of their sidechain, with a Bitcoin P2Pool. The bitcoin rewards paid out to the sidechains by the Bitcoin P2Pool would be claimed by owners of the various poolcoins, who could convert their poolcoins back to bitcoin via the sidecoin -&gt; bitcoin conversion process that sidechain functionality enables.
This would allow multiple small sub-pools to combine their efforts in one high hashrate P2Pool, to reduce payout variance, without any trusted third parties.

If MtGox didn't happen, there would be no Bitcoin economy to speak of. There was no venture capital interest in a Bitcoin exchange back in 2010, so only amateur exchanges like MtGox had a chance of being created.
Viable alternatives to MtGox would have been created in the US in 2011 or 2012 if the cost of opening a money transmission business in the US was lower. The reason the cost is high is due to regulation.

First of all, blocks have been far smaller than the block size allowed by the limit for almost the entirety of the last six years, and yet transaction fees per kB have not gone down. If the lack of competition for space will push fees down, there's been no evidence of it so far.
Second, you can create block space scarcity with a 20 or 100 MB block size limit. Thinking that a lower limit creates more scarcity relative to demand is like thinking that shutting down four lanes of a five lane auction-based tollway, will increase tolls on the last remaining lane, when in fact it will just push people to use a different transportation route (payment-network/blockchain).
Third, the best way to collect more fees by inducing demand and maintaining scarcity is to have a dynamic block size limit that tracks the average block size. If there is demand for 1 GB of space per block, the fee maximising limit will be something close to 1 GB, in order to create competition for space, while still meeting (and collecting fees on) a large portion of market demand.

P2Pool can co-exist with pools. Miners can use P2Pool to mine Bitcoin, while using pools to merge-mine sidechains. Meaning, decentralization of Bitcoin mining is not endangered by side chains, should a better P2Pool solution emerge.


GBT can remove the power of pools to do &gt;50% attacks, which greatly decentralizes control over the blockchain.


The Bitcoin blockchain can be kept much smaller, and therefore easier to mine with P2Pool, if the bulk of transaction volume growth occurs on sidechains. This would make mining of Bitcoin proper more decentralized.

On the one hand, you have Icesave. On the other, you have the fact that in the UK, there's only been one new high street banking license issued in the last 150 years, meaning the incumbent banks have had a virtual oligopoly on retail banking for a century and a half. And despite the strict licensing, that is supposed to prevent banking failures (and make all of the dearth of competition a price worth paying), the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS still needed a £65 billion bail-out to stay afloat in 2008 and 2009.
The economic harm from the occasional Icesave is nothing compared to the harm of destroying innovation and competition throughout an entire industry. Imagine if Bitcoin were only Bitpay and Coinbase, because Bitcoin companies needed to comply with onerous regulations to be allowed to operate. There would be no Bitcoin. In fact, if a regulated industry is what entrepreneurs and venture capitalists had to look forward to in the Bitcoin space, they wouldn't have invested in Bitpay and Coinbase in the first place, and they wouldn't exist either.

Yea well it's not constructive.


Yes I believe things like MtGox should continue to be able to happen but not because it's other people who would lose money. It's because people should decide for themselves if they will use an untrusted, potentially poorly run company. No one, not you, me, or a regulator, should have the right to make that decision for them.


And if it can't succeed because everyone thinks they shouldn't have to pay for someone else's mistakes, then it shouldn't be forced on people. People don't believe they should pay for other people's mistakes, so why should you or I force them to do that? 


Hey, that's the price of freedom. I don't force you to pay for my mistakes, and you don't force me. If we want long term security, then we have to pay for insurance, but no one will force us to do that.


I edited that line right after you responded to it. The line after the edit is:


which should answer your question. But on to this particular point about investment, yes, I should be able to invest in "shady" (poorly run) companies, and people should be able to patronize shady companies should they choose.


We don't allow people to sell them scams. A scam breaks the law. But what is a "scam"? Every poorly run company on a shoestring budget that fails and loses their customer's money, or provides a shoddy product? That's just a business failure, not a scam. That's not illegal.
Even in terms of dealing with scams, the right way to stop it is to punish those convicted of running a scam, not punish everyone, with license requirements, to try to prevent scams from ever happening.


If we believe in liberal democracy, then we have to give them all of their liberty. It's this principle, that people have a right to decide for themselves what is best for them, that is why we give everyone a right to vote. We don't diminish the control they have over their own life, just because we might think they don't know what's best for themselves.


If you gave people an opt-out of the regulatory system, I would never complain about regulations again.

There are different degrees of security. I wouldn't say that zero-conf txs are absolutely insecure.

With replace-by-fee, that chance increases significantly.

Thinking the cost of running the network is the only factor to consider is the problem with your analysis. There is no  perfect solution, but there are optimal ones, and a 1 MB or 2 MB limit, where people have to use trusted third party controlled wallets if Bitcoin sees any sort of adoption is far from it. 20 MB is already an extreme compromise that guarantees Bitcoin will have to do another hard fork if it sees any significant success. As for what's going to happen, we'll see. 


I agree that this is a problem, but there are many other potential solutions besides a hard limit. A hard limit handicaps legitimate usage of the blockchain in the name of stopping spam.

Then that will cause a network partition. You don't even know the basic requirements of a distributed consensus protocol, and here you are continuously making insulting comments alleging I'm just writing "random words" and that I don't know what I'm talking about.


It's not Bitcoin that would need to be upgraded, it's the pool mining software, which is separate from the Bitcoin node software. A very simple upgrade could eliminate all danger posed by centralized pools. That alone would make it pointless for any attacker to target them.


It's not about honesty, it's about power. Governments don't have the power to seize ASIC manufacturers. They do have the power to issue arrest warrants for delegates that are directly running an unregulated currency. That makes Bitcoin immeasurably more secure than any network using a PoS based consensus protocol.

Well the other solution can be worked even if there is an over-time rate of increase. As long as the rate of increase isn't too fast, it only facilitates scalability to have it, so picking a rate that's extremely conservative and turns out to be too slow is better than nothing. Think of it this way: not having a rate of increase is like choosing a rate of increase of 0%, which we know will be below technology performance gains, due to the cumulative nature of technological performance, so why not make it more than 0, but still very conservative?

'Regulation', which is more accurately described as a ban, that cannot be justified on NAP grounds,  on engaging in a particular activity without restrictions, is an institutional evil. Any arbitrary limit on human freedom is an evil. No one should be banned from engaging in an activity that does not violate another person's autonomy.


That is not what regulatory bans do. There is absolutely no proof that setting up a poker site, a sports betting website, or a poorly run exchange, is an clear indication that someone seeks to do evil. The presumption in knowing someone's intentions, and the violation of their right to run a business that honestly advertises its services, and which customers voluntarily patronise, is the evil.

I agree with you that side chains alone are not enough. The main chain will be the universally adopted one, and it needs more than 420 transactions per minute for a $60 trillion global economy.
However, side chains can contribute to scalability and decentralisation. Walmart can host the main chain and all side chains, but the average Joe can limit himself to hosting just the side chain specific to his locality (for example). The result is a far larger number of people running nodes that validate transaction data.

This compares Bitcoin at its security worst (lack of threats resulting in majority of users taking the convenient option of relying on a small group of parties) to a PoS based blockchain at its best, and calls them equal. In a crisis scenario, when trusted third parties are targets, a PoW based consensus protocol is much better able to survive without being coopted and/or disrupted than a PoS based one. PoW is Bitcoin's fail-safe, and a distributed currency needs one as resilient as PoW to be credible.

So what? People in the third world will not be able to use bitcoin if the average transaction costs $20 in fees. Better they can generate txs independently, and not have to rely on a hosted wallet to hold their deposits and send funds on their behalf, than that they be able to validate a blockchain that they can't directly access.


They can use SPV clients, which only require &gt;50% of the mining network to be honest to be secure against practically any attack. If the block size limit stays in place, and millions more adopt Bitcoin, that's when most users will have to use trusted and centralized online wallets that do off-chain transactions, since they won't be able to afford to do on-chain transactions.


Pruning is being rolled out by the developers.

Fair enough, but it's a small price to pay in my opinion. Without money for development, Bitcoin will stagnate. If a for profit company is funding $20+ million worth of open source development, I count that as a positive. That several core devs are onboard, which will increase the likelihood of whatever developed actually getting the community consensus needed to be implemented in Bitcoin, is even better. 
All things have to be considered, not just the legal status of the organization providing the funding. From what I learned from the AMA about who's behind Blockstream, the for-profit status is way down on the list of things I'm concerned about:

One of the best ways to increase the full node count is to increase the size of the Bitcoin economy. It's not just the operating cost of running a full node that determines the number of full nodes in operation. It's also the number of people who have an economic interest in auditing the blockchain. Right now that number is very low because there are very few people involved in Bitcoin, relatively speaking. The way you increase that number is by increasing the size of the Bitcoin economy, and in a way where people are still directly accessing the blockchain. And for that, the block size limit needs to be raised.

You claim altcoins are scams yet your business accepts them. You're not being honest here. And you said it yourself that Bitcoiners should resign to the possibility of there being a mass sell-off as everyone migrates to an altcoin. 
You exaggerate the risk of a conflict of interest among Bitcoin developers being paid by Blockstream, and minimize the risk of the cryptocurrency space fragmenting due to a Bitcoin that's without sidechain functionality losing market share to emerging blockchains with new features. In fact, you implied the latter scenario is not an undesirable outcome, before backtracking when I called you out on it.
To me it's evident that you don't share the same priorities as most Bitcoiners in wanting a Bitcoin that is able to quickly incorporate new features into its ecosystem to allow it to better compete with altcoins, and that you have a overly controlling nature where you don't want others to have the option of using a feature that they want to use, and that you think is not good.

It's true that none of the other core developers are proposing a hard fork, but I think, and I could be wrong, that every core developer supports a hard fork eventually. The debate is over when it's done, what exactly the hard fork looks like (does it increase to 20 MB, or some other value? Or even a dynamic limit?), and what the long term plan (ie when blocks start coming up against the new limit) is.

High switching costs due to high on-chain transaction fees will mean people will become even more dependent on e-wallets run by large corporations. A Bitcoin economy where users are dependent on large off-chain ledgers is very similar to the modern banking system, and is a setup that is inherently prone to getting regulated, as the modern banking system has.

I don't think co-opting the entire development team is easy, but co-opting the developer team's project website, where clients are downloaded from, is. This would be a very visible attack (the globally dispersed development team is not going to be silenced simultaneously), and the community could react by stopping client downloads. Everyone who already has a client could continue to connect and use the network though. 
An attack on a PoS blockchain could affect some of those who already have clients, and those who rely on third parties like web wallets to feed them transaction data, which is a larger group of people, and this could seriously disrupt the network, causing a significant number of people to be diverted to a fork.

Until then however, it's better for the adoption of BTC-like currency for the market to standardize around BTC.

Bitcoin miners can merge mine sidechains at almost zero extra cost. That means ANY transaction fees on the sidechain will be incentive enough for BTC miners to mine it. It's basically free money you can earn while mining BTC. There's no downside.
And if not enough BTC miners decide to merge mine a particular sidechain, then it won't be secure, and people won't use that sidechain. It's no one's loss.

Very good point. Even if the meritocracy of core developers makes better decisions than the shortsighted decisions of profit seeking miners, I believe the former is a much more political/centralised governing structure.
It's also for this reason that I think that if at all possible, we would ideally have one hard fork that deals with the hard limit once and for all. Hard forks require the community to delegate quite a bit of power to centralised parties so that they can be successfully coordinated, so the fewer hard forks we have, the better.

If nothing is perfect, we need multiple solutions so that they can compensate for each other's weaknesses. One obvious solution, that complement others solutions like sidechains and the LN, is to stick with the original consensus and vision for Bitcoin, which is to allow anyone who wants to use on-chain transactions to do so cheaply. There was never any consensus to use the 1 MB anti-spam limit as a way to implement an economic policy of throttling the volume of legitimate (non-dust/spam) txs.

Off-chain tx is literally centralisation. It's entrusting BTC to a trusted third party, which then transacts on the blockchain on one's behalf.

Pruning significantly reduces storage costs.

I agree, and the fact that I posted my particular argument after I called your argument a straw man made it seem like that was the logic I was using.
The reason your post is a straw man is that most pro &gt;1MB-blockers do not say "Extreme centralization is fine". They disagree with you that the size of blocks made possible by the current hard fork proposals would lead to "extreme centralization".


The advantage of lower earnings/payout-variance that size gives larger pools already makes that irrelevant. The very large pools already control the vast majority of pooled mining, and making it a tiny bit worse due to larger block nodes isn't going to significantly degrade the centralization situation in mining. In the future, GBT adoption could make the operating cost for a pool to run a full node irrelevant even if the payout-variance shortcoming of small pools could somehow be solved.

IBLT is not irrelevant to sending the data between peers every 10 minutes, because it means you only need to be able to send it out over the entire 10 min, instead of within a few seconds, all at once, after a new block is generated.


Initial blockchain download is an entirely different issue from "send between peers (as they are today) every 10 minutes", and downloading a few terabytes is entirely possible.


1 GB/minute is affordably available in quite a few places, and its availability will only improve over the next few years.
In any case, you don't need to have Bitcoin peers with "affordable" broadband packages in order to have a functional peer-to-peer network. A Bitcoin blockchain with 10 GB blocks, assuming it is filled with data representing legitimate real world transactions and not worthless spam, would be an economic superpower in market terms, and would very possibly be able to support tens of thousands of supernodes with expensive, very high end broadband connections.

This proposal is totally impractical in the current form. However, it has the following strengths:
* BDD is hard (economically) to spoof. 
* Users are not going to trust third parties to store their private key for them. If they want to use their privkey to create signed UTXO_sets, they will have to have a local copy of the UTXO_set so that they can sign them.
* For trusted third parties who control BTC on behalf of their users, there is an economic cost to creating many txs with UTXO_set proofs just to 'fool' the network, since on-chain txs require fees be paid, while off-chain txs do not.
So maybe it can be reworked into something that is practical.
I'll also add that strictly using BDD wouldn't work, since a single large tx with a value of X would destroy the same number of bitcoin days as a thousand small txs, each with a value of X/1000. There would need to be some cap on how much of the value of a tx is used in the calculation of the BDD, so that X BTC spent through many small txs makes a much larger contribution to BDD than if it were spent by one large one.
EDIT: they don't need to store multiple full UTXO_sets, as suggested in the Pastebin description. They could store just the nodes further up the tree, and recalculate the bottom nodes as needed.

No, that would be downloading each block twice. Gavin specifically says:

The current crop of micropayment channel solutions have tons of shortcomings, so I don't what you're talking about. For one, transaction malleability makes it vulnerable to attacks where the payee holds the collateral BTC locked in the channel hostage. 
The theoretical LN will have much fewer shortcomings, but it will still require people locking BTC in channels, it requires always-on servers to publish the final version of the off-chain record in time, and it could have severe privacy shortcomings (especially if cheap on-chain txs are not available to allow people to use CoinJoin or multiple MP channels to protect their privacy). Mike Hearn explains some other potential shortcomings of the LN here:
We won't know for what limitations it will have and what use cases the LN can fully and adequately substitute for on-chain txs until it's been tested in a real world environment.

Those with a greater economic stake in Bitcoin have a greater interest in voting in a way that grows the network. It's irrelevant whether they're rich or poor. In the same way, we don't care that the majority of the network hashrate is controlled by a relatively small percentage of the user base. The point of letting majority hashrate decide the history is that those who control it have a strong economic incentive to act in accordance with the utility of the network.

It's as bad as it can be. All hashers rely on the pool to audit the blocks they're mining on. It can't get any worse than that. How can get it any worse than ~0% of hashers auditing?


Sorry, mistype. I meant, people use POOLS because they want to reduce payout variance.


I think the risk that large pools will switch to light clients due to larger blocks, and that the Bitcoin mining network won't switch to GBT, which will makes this problem a non-issue, is worth taking on to have more on-chain transactions, which will increase the possibility of wider adoption, which in turn will alleviate the risk of Bitcoin having too small a share of the total population holding a stake in the protocol being free of regulation to pose sufficient political deterrence to attempts to ban the unrestricted use of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-05-31 23:48:32
Even if it did, it has to be balanced by the following:
* there is no consensus to change the 1 MB hard limit, which was intended to be a temporary anti-spam limit to be raised when the average block size approached it, into a tool to implement an economic policy. This alone is enough to move ahead with the hard limit fork. You need consensus, IMO, to change the purpose of Bitcoin's components.
* the encouragement that the pain would give to development off alternate solutions may not make up for the fewer resources available for development as a result of slowing down adoption and the growth in the size of the Bitcoin economy.


The current network has a limit to scale, and market players know this, which will affect their investments and the direction of business development. A large investment is not going to be made by any informed party to create a business model reliant on millions of microtransctions, because the 1 MB hard limit is in place and will limit the scale of this business model.


Instant and practically free txs, that is not limited in volume by any miner soft or hard limit, will allow business models not allowed by on-chain txs. An even more trustless and cost-efficient version of Streamium for example would be incredible.
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:53:55
I think that the devs, who rightfully hold a lot of influence in the Bitcoin community due to the fact that they're among the biggest contributors to it, need to consider that Bitcoin is an experiment, that some changes to the network will necessarily come with uncertainty, and that that's okay. 
The experiment Satoshi created was supposed to try to reach thousands of tps eventually. No one knows what the network will look like if you need a 100 MB/s broadband connection to run a full node, but I think we can be reasonably sure it won't look like PayPal or Visa, because it will still be an open network, where there is no central authority that can vet who can or can't join based on political considerations. 
Of course it's possible that everything that can go wrong with a higher block size limit, does go wrong:
* the block size limit doubles every two years, and broadband connection speeds don't keep up
* blocks grow to reach the hard limit, because the other checks on block size (e.g. transaction priority, miner-set default block size limit, etc) cease to check the rate of block size growth
* larger blocks don't lead to a higher full node count, as some have predicted, and instead exacerbate the downward trend 
* the governments of the world coordinate a global ban on the unrestricted operation of a full node, and the larger blocks make the difference between Bitcoin being able to circumvent the legislation and Bitcoin falling mercy to the global enforcement effort
It's possible, but I think extremely unlikely. Not having a high block size limit has its own set of risks. In any shape or form, there is uncertainty in Bitcoin's future. So I think it's worth following through with Satoshi's experiment, and removing the temporary anti-spam limit.

Yes it eliminates the type of fraud that is committed against credit card users, but it also makes new types of victim-ful crime easier, like digital theft of consumer's money (stealing bitcoins from people's computers).
One major potential safety benefit of Bitcoin is allowing merchants to accept a cash-like payment without having any cash in store, by using watch only Bitcoin wallets. This is made possible by the fact that bitcoin can be split into any number and size of values, discarding of the need for merchants to have cash on hand to provide change.

The best way to enable the type of global ban you're referring to is to make efforts to keep Bitcoin small and irrelevant. By being small, and not having a significant portion of the public rely on it, it becomes easier for a politician to propose and push through a ban against it.
If the internet had taken 20 years to scale to more than a few hundreds thousand users, there is a very good possibility that you would need a license right now to run a server. It's only because it grew so rapidly, to hundreds of millions of users within a few years, that this kind of law is now unthinkable. Once the public has grown accustomed to something being freely accessible without government permission, any law to ban its unrestricted use becomes politically unviable. That's what happened with the internet, and that's what would give Bitcoin the best chance of remaining uncensored into the future.

Bitcoin originally had no 1 MB block size limit. It was put in place as a band-aid solution to prevent spam attacks. The plan, when it was put in place, was to raise/remove it when the amount of legitimate transaction data approached the limit.

Because it's an OS for money, a profit motive is not necessarily bad for Bitcoin. For instance, all early investors in Bitcoin made out with a huge profit, whilst helping Bitcoin get bootstrapped.
SCs would increase the value of Bitcoin-main, simply because they would make bitcoin currency usable in a larger ecosystem. Bitcoin does not necessarily have unlimited amounts of time to develop scalability solutions. There are potential trends that could move against it, everything from altcoin competiton (which SCs are potent against) to gov legislation (which mass adoption, enabled by SC scalability and functionality, can neutralize). At the risk of repeating myself, I'll say that it's riskier to wait for non-profit money to find scalability and functionality solutions to Bitcoin's shortcomings, than use for-profit money to develop open source SC functionality.

True, but is more of a circlejerk. 
Exhibit A:
Person puts Bitcoin as screensaver on computers and tablets in Apple Store, gets mostly criticism for changing others' property for the promotion of Bitcoin:
One of the most top voted comments, from a long-time troll, is:




Person does the same a month later, just with Dogecoin, gets only praise:
Exhibit B:
The Bitcointip bot has a section in the subreddit on Reddiquette, with guidelines on how to be a polite Redditor while tipping. A couple of these pointers are:
* Don't abuse the "verify" feature.
 
* Tipping miniscule amounts may be considered rude.
 
The subreddit for the Dogetipbot, which is a fork of the open source bitcointip bot, doesn't, and in fact encourages people to tip other people tiny amounts, using an example of someone tipping 10 Dogecoins (Worth 2 cents at the moment): 
It also verifies transactions by default (**Edit**, This aspect of it is being changed soon. It will soon not verify tips by default), whereas to avoid spamming other subreddits, the bitcointip bot requires the user to include the 'verify' option in order for the bot to verify the tip in a public post. 
There is a lot more self-criticism and self-regulation in the Bitcoin subreddits. Over there, everything is a joke, and ignoring rules is the rule. It might be a very effective way to run a promotion, as people are more willing to do things like the above, but this is because it's more of a circle jerk, as people are less willing to refrain from using arguably unethical strategies for personal gain.

I think there's next to no chance of miners being regulated as a result of blocks getting bigger. Miners are globally distributed, and any effective regulation has to be able to affect every major jurisdiction, which I find extremely unlikely. It might even be the case that smaller blocks make such regulation more likely, by keeping the economy smaller, which in turn causes the number of full nodes to be lower, despite the lower operating cost of running a full node with smaller blocks, simply because a smaller economy means a lower total number of Bitcoin users who would even consider running a full node.


Hashers don't need to run a full node. In any case, a block size limit high enough to allow 25000 tps will not be in place under Gavin's 40%/year increase proposal until around 2030, at which point ordinary people will be able to run full nodes that can handle this kind of bandwidth.

Straw man. An argument that I've made to you specifically for example:


A balance needs to be struck between portion of the world population that can access the blockchain with their own private keys on a regular basis (raising the limit helps in this regard), and the portion of the Bitcoin using population that can easily run a full node (lowering the limit helps in this regard). The right limit will rise as technology improves, since average computing/broadband performance improves the latter at a given average block size. 
Right now, my guess is that the right limit is way above 1 MB. If it were up to me, the limit would be raised to 20 MB, and increased by 20% per year for 30 years thereafter. If this out paces average broadband connection speed gains, it's most likely not be the end of the world, as there are other mechanisms, besides the hard limit, that can and do check the size of the average block, which is why 5 years after the 1 MB block size limit was put in place, the average block size is still far from that limit.

How about "desirable"? An attacker desires to destroy the blockchain. You're splitting hairs here. The point is, without an opportunity cost, a PoS miner can try a practically unlimited number of votes, to see what their outcome would be, before actually casting their vote, which is not possible for a PoW miner.


That makes the currency extremely centralized and vulnerable, because the delegates make for easy targets for governments. A distributed ledger can't depend on the continued participation of trusted figures to operate reliably and be credible.

I think using privacy-enhancing methods at particular junctions is enough to provide pretty good privacy. 
For example, if you withdraw a small amount of bitcoin from an exchange wallet, into a local spare change wallet, the link between your spare change wallet and the rest of your bitcoin will be severed to anyone looking at just the blockchain. 
If you're then careful to not publicly identify yourself as the owner of any of the addresses in the spare change wallet,  or are careful to only make transactions with the spare change wallet that you don't mind the public knowing about, then the odds of compromising or embarrassing information being revealed through analysis of public transactions goes down tremendously.
It's not perfect, but I think it's enough until Reusable addresses (aka the Stealth Address) become common place, at which point transacting in bitcoin in privacy will become much improved, and easier.

Pools aren't competitive unless they have a significant share of the network hashrate, because reducing payout variance is the main value proposition of a pool, and improves as network hashrate share increases.


If the goal is to not depend on large pools, then the payout variance issue needs to be resolved. Operating costs of running a full node will continue to be a non-factor, regardless of the average block size. We could even move to GBT, where hashers outsource transaction data from a party other than their pool, thus nullifying the centralization risk posed by pools.

If Bitcoin is being used by hundreds millions of people, to transfer hundreds of billions of dollars worth of BTC per day, and the average block size is 1 GB (to put that in perspective, that is 1.67 MB of tx data per second), there will be tens of thousands of data centres running full nodes. The idea that only two parties will allocate 1.67 MB/s of their broadband connection to support and validate a network used by hundreds of millions of people a day, is unrealistic. I appreciate the focus on security that motivates this hyper-cautious treatment of decentralisation, but this is not the optimal trade-off.

You're only looking at the technical side of it. Leaving the 1 MB block size issue for later is risky due to political/social reasons. Every hard fork brings with it uncertainty and risks because it requires wide consensus to be carried out smoothly. As long as these risks hang over the Bitcoin economy, many companies will be hesitant to make long-term commitments to the Bitcoin economy. Afterall, a hard fork could lead to Bitcoin community splitting into two networks, or a hard fork could end up not happening due to community infighting. Both of these would be disastrous for the Bitcoin economy.
The 1 MB block size limit needs to removed as soon as possible, and replaced with something that scales automatically, rather than through risky hard forks that require political consensus. It's 2015, Microsoft, one of the largest companies in the world, accepts Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin network can only handle 3 transactions per second, unless there is a hard fork. Getting rid of the 1 MB block size limit is long overdue.

Retail is just an example of a low-cost transaction. Without low-cost transactions, Bitcoin will only usable for the rich, which is not what Satoshi envisioned, or the majority of Bitcoin users are involved for.


You don't need to wait for a confirmation in a retail transaction under $100. I'm not sure why you would think you do, unless you don't have very much Bitcoin pos experience. I have done numerous pos transactions, and have never needed to wait for 1 confirmation before it was considered finalized.

Sidechains would allow people to use their BTC to create BTC-derivatives, like using petroleum to produce gasoline. The use of sidechains would be totally voluntary, so no one, including you, would be forced to use them. They would just expand the number of things people will be able to do with their BTC, should they choose. Their only unintended consequence would be making the BTC ecosystem more competitive against altcoins.

Even if bandwidth growth does slow, which I think is unlikely as there are many low hanging fruit in boosting consumer bandwidth, it's extremely unlikely to undershoot 40 percent per year (Gavin's proposed BSLGR) by a significant margin, so the worst case not-farfetched scenario is a Bitcoin network that is *slightly* more expensive for the average person to participate in as a full node operator. This is not even taking into account the data propagation optimizations that Bitcoin has yet to implement, that further reduce the necessary bandwidth growth rate needed to maintain current network accessibility if Gavin's proposal were adopted and the limit was hit on every block.
2. Even if the above assumptions don't hold, and not only does bandwidth growth drastically deviate from the historical trend for the worse, but the demand for block space pushes block sizes to the maximum allowed, there is still the soft limit on the block size, which miners will set individually on their own, and which under Gavin's proposal, by default will remain forever at 1 MB. The soft limit has a significant restraining effect on both decreases in the average transaction fee and increases in the average block size, and has not historically increased without concerted campaigns to encourage miners to raise it (last time being when the soft limit was raised from 250 kB to 750 kB). Considering the hard limit itself is likely to be conservative enough to maintain Bitcoin's accessibility and decentralization, the added restraint on block sizes that the soft limit provides makes Gavin's proposal very low risk from a centralization threat stand point.
I believe the biggest obstacle to Bitcoin's mass adoption is the 1 MB block size limit. It's hard to get the consensus needed to do a hard fork, and for that reason, I think we should get behind Gavin's proposal even if it's less than perfect. Fortunately, I see it as a very good proposal, making this an easy decision.

It's modern finance. Modern banking is also not a single central point of failure. If banks in Canada get regulated, I can use an account hosted by a bank in Russia. It's a series of central points of failure, that consistently fail, because governments have no problem squashing them.
It's the distributed nature of the blockchain, and the all-or-nothing nature of attempting to shut the Bitcoin network down, that makes it very very difficult to squash. If Bitcoin gives up on trying to be a network accessible by all, and requires the average user to use Trusted Third Parties (a series of central points of failure), its advantage is all but over, and the Bitcoin ecosystem will have all of the vulnerabilities of traditional banking, minus a more resilient backbone for large transactions. I don't think consigning Bitcoin to be simply a slightly cheaper and more accessible international wire transfer network is appropriate.


Bandwidth has grown by 50 percent a year over the last 20 years. If the block size limit is set to grow by, say, 40 percent a year, there is a very good likelihood that bandwidth growth will outpace block size growth.


If Bitcoin achieves mass adoption, with a block size limit that grows only 40 percent a year, there will be very high demand for blockchain space relative to supply, and a resultant increase in efficiency of that use.


We can reach a consensus on this. The biggest threat to Bitcoin is that it doesn't scale before the more repressive governments of the world convince the liberal democracies to squash it. Mass adoption requires more than 1 MB of transaction data every 10 minutes, and mass adoption is the only thing that can give the Bitcoin blockchain enough economic resources to become safe from a global attack. Governments move slow, but not that slow. 
The next biggest threat is that Bitcoin lingers in a stagnant state for years, because the 1 MB block size limit stands in the way of mass adoption, giving altcoins the space to take significant market share from it, until the Bitcoin community finally wakes up and makes the network scalable, at which point, the cryptocurrency market is split between multiple incompatible blockchains, and lacks the clear standard needed to achieve mass adoption.
Bitcoin needs to get rid of the 1 MB block size limit, and pursue mass adoption, asap, imo.

My example demonstrates the flawed principle behind your argument.
I'll explain the principle again using the example:
By that logic, we should prohibit alcohol. If my business associate becomes an alcoholic, our partnership will fail, and I'll lose a lot of money. If my customers become alcoholics, they'll spend all of their money on booze, instead of on my products. That'll hurt my business. Hence, I have a right to bar them from drinking.
**You can't start limiting other people's freedom, just because their failure is not in your interest.** Ultimately you only have a right to your own actions and property. You're not entitled to other people's. If other people want to destroy their own wealth, they have a moral right to, even if it is not in the interest of the collective.
^ The part in bold is applicable no matter how much 'collective harm' is being caused.


I don't have a right to give MY money to someone else, in exchange for some financial product? You think the government has a right to control other people. This is the problem. You don't even think others have a right to be free.


I'm talking about moral rights, not legal rights.

It's misleading to say they're "working with" another hashing algorithm. The development of a client is not at all affected by a modular replacement of SHA-256. Everything else in the client can be copied whole-sale from Bitcoin, which is exactly what the clonecoins have been doing as Bitcoin core has been upgraded.


The Bitcoin community's disapproval and hostility toward unoriginal alts is why the Bitcoin ecosystem has not fragmented across an increasing number of mutually incompatible blockchains, and why the aggregate coin supply has not hyperinflated to zero value. Copycat blockchains should not be given legitimacy and credibility that they don't deserve. As experiments to try out new parameters they're fine, but that's all.

For this, you need the Bitcoin blockchain to be able to interact with other blockchains. This would allow the issuance of altcoins in sidechains that are convertible into bitcoin. Then you could have merge-mined sidechains that act as shareholders in the P2Pool sharechain. The sidechain would reward miner contributions made to a P2Pool on its behalf, with BTC-backed altcoins.
There are several proposals on how to make sidechains with two-way convertibility with Bitcoin possible. The most prominent is the one created by Adam Back and company, while relies on the SPV verification of a sidechain transaction to reanimate the suspended bitcoin that back the sidechain altcoins:
My proposal was to create a new proof of work transaction type, with POW addresses that encode the information necessary to validate whether a transaction meets a sidechain's difficulty target:

Three things:
1. Bitcoin enables electronic transactions between parties without requiring any of them to go through a lengthy process to be setup to send/receive electronic payments.
2. Bitcoin enables electronic transactions that do not require the two parties to disclose private information to the other.
3. Bitcoin enables electronic micropayments with small fees through  network transactions and micropayments with next to zero fees through zero-trust payment channels.
Some of the things that have been made possible by this: 
* making ad hoc electronic payments to anonymous parties on the internet.
* receiving payments from a company without having to give them your address (if they were to send you a cheque) or banking details (for electronic transfers).
* making payments to companies that established payment processors companies might not be willing to serve, or who cannot afford a merchant account to receive credit card payments
* creating a global micropayment standard for services like wifi access, without relying on a single party, that could fail, to provide the ledger
But this is really just a limited account of what's possible. Most importantly, Bitcoin cannot be restricted to a select few, meaning anyone can join the network and begin participating as a payment processor, a bank, or a wallet provider. This opens a world of competition and innovation in money and finance which will make it much easier for us to pay others and receive payments. By eliminating the gatekeeper, both at the payment level, and the currency issuance level, Bitcoin disrupts both the payment and the monetary sector entirely.

The point is, there was no need for a trusted third party, with global reach, to make the international transaction possible. Since it could be done without a trusted third party, there was no need for the merchant to apply for a merchant account with a credit card company. 
All the merchant needed was a mobile phone and software they could freely download. It had the convenience and ease of a cash transaction, but with the major benefit of being electronic and possible to conduct instantaneously between people from different places on the planet.

It doesn't need to go through a gateway intermediary. The fiat transaction can be effected by the buyer, and go directly from the buyer's financial institution, to the seller's. A gateway intermediary is one additional point of failure. 
The BTS collaterized USD substitute is yet another point of failure. If there is a sudden shift in BTS's price, the whole thing can collapse. 


Proof of Stake is prone to centralization, as it can only be secure with highly trusted parties that the entire userbase relies on. This is a SPOF that can be attacked if it gains any kind of traction.
PoS has a whole slew of vulnerabilities stemming from the fact that there's nothing at stake when voting with stake. Someone can buy up old private keys that once held a lot of coins, and the use them to do a long-range attack that rewrites history. The solution to this is centralized checkpointing (not decentralized), or cementing (leads to globally inconsistent view).

If the free market were guaranteed to be that effective, I would be ecstatic. It would mean that the natural forces of the free market can maximize innovation, and there is no need for IP laws. But I think there is a very good possibility that these forces will not always be sufficient to reward a market share that's proportional to the value contributed by a cryptocurrency's developers.
We can look at the history of altcoins for a counter-example. Litecoin copied almost everything from Bitcoin, save for a different block time, and the use of Scrypt for its PoW algorithm. Both of these relatively modest innovations were pioneered by Tenebrix, yet Litecoin's market share was thousands of times greater than the former. Given the similarity of Litecoin to Bitcoin, it should have had an insignificant market share relative to Bitcoin's, yet for a long time, its market cap was 10 percent of BTC's.
At one point, Litecoin came close to becoming a prominent alternative to Bitcoin. There were a few major service providers in the Bitcoin space which were contemplating accepting it alongside Bitcoin. If that were to happen, it would have seen its legitimacy skyrocket. 
A cryptocurrency space divided along two nearly identical blockchains would have then been ripe for further fragmentation, as Bitcoin's network effect under those circumstances would have been even smaller than when Litecoin managed to seize a large share of its market.
Combined, the two blockchains would have been far less valuable than Bitcoin is now, because the public would have perceived BTC-like cryptocoins as lacking a credible scarcity, and the situation could only have gotten worse with further fragmentation, similar to the rapid devaluation of Beanie Babies in the 1990s as the supply of 'limited edition' runs increased, and other companies copied its business model to create their own 'scarce' toys.
It was due to a conscious campaign by Bitcoin maximalists that this scenario did not pan out. I think until Bitcoin, or another cryptocurrency, attains a network effect that's large enough where the possibility of it losing significant market share to a new cryptocurrency in the near future drops close to zero, a conscious effort is required by cryptocurrency advocates to preserve the digital scarcity of the 21 million BTC or whatever money supply is used by the dominant blockchain if it's not BTC. 
As Bitcoin is currently dominant, and the first cryptocurrency in history, I think the best chance cryptocurrency in general has of achieving mass adoption is if the cryptocurrency community rallies behind it.


Under those circumstances, early adopters in BTC would profit handsomely. It would be among the largest, if not largest financial windfalls in history. However, as I've argued previously, a one-time financial windfall is not as dangerous to wealth equality as it may appear. The key reason for this is that the BTC windfall could only be spent once. The real sources of wealth inequality are institutions that provide the wealthy with the ability to extract rent from the economy on a perpetual basis. Central banks would be perfect example of this.
Over time, any wealth distribution will tend towards the natural ability of actors in an economy to accumulate more wealth, no matter what the initial wealth distribution is. I believe that in a free market, this generally holds true: give a homeless man $1 million, and in 20 years, he will likely be homeless again. Take a wealthy man's fortune away, and in 20 years he will be wealthy again.
In other words, under a free market, which Bitcoin would expand, greater wealth would not beget an ability to accumulate wealth at a faster rate, as it would in a controlled market where it's possible to purchase the ability to extract economic rent on a perpetual basis, and it is this ability that is at the heart of extreme wealth inequality. The professional history of extremely wealthy business people demonstrates this: the period during which their personal wealth increased at its fastest rate was when they were starting out, and had the least wealth. Political power is the opposite. With more control over the gatekeepers, those at the top can accelerate their expansion of power, until they have seized total control of the economy, which is what you see in authoritarian dictatorships.
In other words, Bitcoin would do far more to reduce wealth inequality, by reducing the ability of gatekeepers to permanently extract economic rent, than it would to increase it, by giving early adopters a large one time windfall.
Also, I do not believe a dominant Bitcoin necessarily means a fixed cryptocoin supply. Like in my partially pegged sidechain idea, there are means of expanding the money supply without risking a total devaluation of the dominant cryptocurrency stock. Mastercoin and Counterparty would be other examples of new currency supply being added, while still accruing value to bitcoin holders (in this case by making space in the Bitcoin blockchain more highly demanded).


Land is unique in that there is physical scarcity of land, and no assets that have the potential to act as substitutes. Bitcoin's position will always be more precarious as there will always be more avenues to accrue market share to new currency stock than there will be to generate land.
Also, even with the characteristic that distinguishes land from other fixed supply assets, concentration of land holdings could be a symptom of institutions in the economy that act as concentrators of wealth, rather than a cause of concentrated wealth.

A high block size limit won't make people use Bitcoin, but a low block size limit most likely will prevent people from using Bitcoin. Raising the block size limit is a requirement for mass adoption.


It's much easier to do that when there are a few hundreds thousand Bitcoin users, and about 5,000 full node operators. 
It's like the internet analogy. The only chance Bitcoin has of being safe from this type of legal treatment is mass adoption and widespread use by the public.

They don't need to donate. The poor are not dependent on the generosity of the rich or the availability of welfare to see an improvement in their life. The natural order of things, under a free market, is for the station of the poor to improve as the rich seek to satisfy their own ends, and in the process, without intending it, drive wages up and make products more affordable. That is why today, the poor are able to afford smart phones, while 30 years ago, only the rich had mobile phones, and no one had smart phones. That is why the Chinese middle class is growing. 
The great wealth disparity in modern America is not a result of capitalism. All of it is a result of differential access to the market, due to regulatory impediments to market entry that selectively filter out the poor. In regions that are becoming more capitalistic, the poor are seeing significant improvements in their economic condition. It's capitalism, not welfarism, that is responsible for the bulk of the improvement in the standard of living of the world's poor.

What could be put on the blockchain is a registry of who (which bitcoin address) owns which activation code, with private keys of bitcoin addresses used to authenticate ownership over activation codes. That would allow you to transfer the activation code (really an activation serial number) to someone else if you sell your software disc to them, by simply transferring the activation code to their bitcoin address. They would be secure in the knowledge that only they have the ability to authenticate ownership over the the activation code, since only they have the private key to the bitcoin address.

A hard fork would be less harmful than altcoins fragmenting the market. And there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will be taken over by the forces of centralization. If that were to occur, we could deal with problem then. There's no need to water the seeds of fragmentation now, by boosting altcoins, when there's no evidence that Bitcoin is about to be coopted by the government.

Once a year is 'regular checkpointing'. If major parties in the Bitcoin are ever attacked in a sustained and global fashion, everyone who has already downloaded a client will be able to continue participating in the network. New client downloads will cease, but the network will not.
A trust-reliant network can be hamstrung by attacking all of its SPOF, including imprisoning its developers, while a proof of work network, if it adapts to the attack scenario, cannot.
Bitcoin currently does have significant centralization through large pools, but those can easily and quickly be abandoned in an attack scenario. Alternatively, pools can begin using the GBT protocol, which removes their ability to select transactions and blocks, and confines their role to distributing mining payouts.
There is also P2Pool which can be significantly upgraded. There is nothing theoretically preventing it from being massively scaled up and all miners migrating to it.

I agree, but the coins themselves are limited. SC-coins are limited by how many people choose to convert their BTC into them. Low demand means few BTC are converted into them, which means it will have a low supply. The fact that its supply tracks demand is why the price remains constant.
My point is that price does not tell us everything. It only tells us the demand *relative to supply*. It's perfectly natural and normal for price to not go down when demand does, if supply goes down at the same rate as demand.

Given that the most reputable members of the Bitcoin community strongly back sidechains, I suggest it's you who doesn't "understand the economic or social implications".


No, your statement is false, and an attempt to mislead. People cannot arbitrarily price something. It's impossible. The only reason a coin is worth something, is because the market prices it at that. With a fully backed SC, the price comes from the BTC backing it, which is priced by the market.


You believe that people shouldn't be allowed to use their BTC to back coins in other blockchains, because you're a control freak, who thinks you have a right to determine how other people's coins are used to maintain the "purity" of your system (whatever the hell that means). 
I actually don't believe that you care about Bitcoin or that these are the reasons why you don't want sidechain functionality added. No one who cares about Bitcoin could knowingly campaign against a feature that would be so positive for the value of BTC, and enable the BTC ecosystem to compete against altcoins so well.

There are no serious technical or economic issues with sidechains.

I reject your loaded terms. A free market has "regulations" and "social safety programs". Regulations in a free market prevent companies from being driven out of the market by force, so there is more competition, resulting in services being more affordable (Uber and Lyft not banned, so cab fares are lower). In Winnipeg, Manitoba, shortage of taxis results in people freezing to death trying to walk home after drinking at a bar, or results in people drinking and driving, and killing others. Lack of competition as a result of regulations can kill people.
Social safety programs exist in voluntary form, in the way of charity. It's not as universal, but it's also less wasteful (charities are more accountable to their donors, and compete with each other, unlike government welfare programs which are monopolies), and causes fewer distortions to the economy (because it's voluntary, it doesn't create a tax evasion industry) allowing for a more robust economy that is able to create more opportunities for the poor.

I think Gavin's proposal is excellent.
Copy-pasting from a text post: 
An important factor that I think should be taken into consideration in the debate over the block size limit is that there are really two block size limits:
The hard limit, which is set by the protocol, and the soft limit, which is set by each individual miner on their own.
What Gavin has proposed is an increase in the hard limit, so that *theoretically*, Bitcoin can gradually process more transaction data every block, up to a maximum of 16 GB per block in 2035.
This however, does not mean that the network would necessarily be able to process 16 GB of transaction data in 2035, because the soft limit, which Gavin is not proposing to change from its current 1 MB, will remain in the hands of miners. If &gt;50 percent of miners choose a particular soft limit, then the network will have to have blocks that remain at or under that size. That means that it is very likely that the effective block size limit will be below the hard limit.
We've already come up against a soft limit before: when it was at 250 kb, and it took a concerted campaign to get consensus to raise it. e.g:
So what all of this means is that immediately raising the hard limit to 16.8 MB, and having it double every two years, for 20 years, while leaving the soft limit up to miners, is actually quite conservative, because it's not that easy to raise the soft limit, and miners are not going to raise it unless there is significant demand for transactions relative to space in the blocks.
By raising the hard limit, Bitcoin will be better able to adapt quickly to rapid growth in demand for transaction space, because it'll be much easier to get a soft limit change, which only requires consensus among miners, than a new hard limit increase, in the event that it's found it's needed.

It's a chicken and egg problem. Unless those you pay accept BTC, you'd be better off receiving fiat from those who pay you. It's getting better with some very large internet/tech companies accepting BTC payments, but for normal every day purchases, BTC acceptance among merchants is well below 1%. I would guess it's somewhere in the neighbourhood of 0.01%.
One thing that would help overcome this chicken and egg problem is a general increase in BTC use, which requires higher transaction volumes, which, again, requires a new block size limit that automatically scales rather than staying frozen at 1 MB.

The total cost of transactions to the network (T) can be found with the following formula:
T = V * N * C
with V = number of transactions, N = number of full nodes, and C = cost of transaction  per node.
The only parties that incur a cost from an increase in transaction volume (V) are people running full nodes. Full nodes download, upload and store every transaction ever created. But using Bitcoin doesn't require you to run a full node. You can run a thin client, and get only download the transaction data that is relevant to you from a full node.
What this means is that the number of people using Bitcoin can increase without total costs (T) increasing, simply by new people opting to use thin clients. An increase in transaction volumes (V) does increase total costs but it increases total transaction fees at the same rate, so there's no need to  increase average transaction fees with increases in transaction volume.

Nothing is secure by default. They can be very secure if they have a significant percentage o f the Bitcoin mining network merge-mining them.


How in the world does allowing people to acquire coins that they can use to try out innovative features in a new blockchain, simply by doing an automated conversion transaction, not add value?
With sidechains, bitcoin holders will have no need to use a third party exchange and no need to use independently generated altcoins, that inflate the total cryptocoin supply, when they want to use a different blockchain. And bitcoin holders will face very little risk that the bitcoin-backed altcoins will plummet in value to zero (as long as the security of the sidechain holds up, the bitcoin backing will keep the value of the coins on the sidechain pegged to bitcoin), unlike when they use altcoins.
Does security, reduced price volatility, p2p interoperability, and reinforcement of digital scarcity, not add value? Absurd..

I know his point and I strongly disagree with it. Bitcoin is a free market currency, so supply shortages can always be made up by other currencies (fiat, alternative cryptocurrencies, etc). Classic theories on deflation don't apply in multi-currency free market settings. They all assume a governmental monopoly on currency.

No, Bitcoin was not secure by default. Miners had to mine it. The same way miners have to mine sidechains for them to be secure.


It's not arbitrary. It's due to being backed by bitcoin being held in escrow on the Bitcoin blockchain. The price of the asset it's using for backing, BTC, is based on price discovery. It's a unique and innovative way of utilizing BTC, that you want to discourage enabling.

While 170 GB per month is not going to pose more than a negligible threat to decentralization, and would probably accompany a multi-fold increase in the size of Bitcoin's userbase, it would be nice if there were some way for the protocol to create economic pressure for miners to only include moderately valuable transactions (e.g. $1 worth) in their blocks, to ensure most of that 170 GB is not low value transaction data (e.g. dust transactions for encoding information). It's not a huge deal, as it's only 170 GB, but it would still be nice. I can't think of a practical way of gauging the value of a transaction in an automated, distributed and trustless manner however.
Maybe miner set soft limits will act as a check on filler transactions.

I am not conflating anything. One of the best ways to increase the full node count is to increase the size of the Bitcoin economy. It's not just the operating cost of running a full node that determines the number of full nodes in operation. It's also the number of people who have an economic interest in auditing the blockchain. Right now that number is very low because there are very few people involved in Bitcoin, relatively speaking. The way you increase that number is by increasing the size of the Bitcoin economy, and in a way where people are still directly accessing the blockchain. And for that, the block size limit needs to be raised.


If the internet userbase had stayed under a few hundred thousand for the first couple of decades, it's much more likely that running a website would be a licensed activity right now. So no, mass adoption is in fact a better form of resistance than hamstringing attempts to bring Bitcoin to the masses.

Satoshi's coins can only come into play once. If they do, the market might even react positively, as it would mean no more surprises left in store. Even if it reacts badly at first, the devaluation would be short-lived. Eventually the increase in active coins would be priced in, and there could be no further drops from Satoshi's new coins. 
Satoshi's coins coming into play would also mean Satoshi is more likely to get involved in the Bitcoin community again, with a lot of capital at his disposal, which would have benefits.

That's not true. Price is determined by supply relative to demand. If the supply of something is low, it can have a high price even if the demand for it is low. 
It's market cap, meaning the price multiplied by the supply, that will match total demand. In the case of an SC-coin, if it's not useful, then very few people will convert their BTC into it, and therefore its market cap will be very low.


Coinlock has a problem with me having that option. He doesn't want the functionality added to Bitcoin.

Resting the growth of the Bitcoin economy on such an optimistic forecast is extremely risky imo, much more so than making the block size limit automatically scale.
Bitcoin risks stagnating if it doesn't reach mass adoption. Bitcoin does not necessarily have "decades" to make it big. It has potential competition in new altcoins, that could result in a fragmented cryptocurrency economy that can never attain the standardization and digital scarcity it needs to compete with fiat currency, and it runs the risk of laws being passed against it before it reaches a level of adoption needed to be immune from widespread bans. 
Governments move slow, but not that slow. While Bitcoin is legal throughout most of the world, it needs to move quickly to become an indispensable part of the economy, that governments, at least in the liberal democracies, cannot afford or find it politically feasible to ban or heavily restrict through regulations, like the internet. If the internet had taken 20 years to move past a few thousand daily users, there's a good chance you would need a license to run a server today, and the result would be that much of the innovation we saw would never take place, and the internet would be a walled garden controlled by a few AOL type companies.

Yes, parasitism off of the developers of the original blockchain, who, due to the nature of cryptocurrency, have a way to profit off of their open source development. I used 'inflation' because it also dilutes the holdings of investors into the original blockchain. That's inflation that's not parasitic, but I believe, with all things being equal, it's still harmful to the industry and technology as a whole.


Well, on this point, I guess we can agree to disagree. 
I don't think there's any likelihood that greater S utility diminishes T utility. Sure it could have some crowding out effect, that in some cases, will result in a person choosing to save when they would otherwise choose to spend, but the positive externalities of the larger market cap that greater S utility brings for the currency's utility in general, will result in higher T utility overall, IMO. More exchanges, more traders, greater purchasing power, more public attention, more multi-use software tools to handle the currency, etc.


True. I don't believe that the benefit of larger market cap has gone to zero, even if it has declined since the end of 2013, so it doesn't warrant being ignored.


Here's an example of a VC singling out the price of bitcoin as important for utility:


Now to conclude, I want to clarify that between bitcoin's digital scarcity / market cap and blockchain technology innovation, I would always choose innovation as the more valuable of the two. I just think that there are ways to maximize blockchain technology innovation that are much less harmful to Bitcoin's digital scarcity, and by extension, the market cap of cryptocurrency in general.

Where are you getting that its infrastructure equal Bitcoin's at the three year mark? Anyway, Bitcoin's first three years were when cryptocurrency was brand new, and there was less interest overall in it, so it was more difficult for any cryptocurrency to gain users early on.
It's taken years for LTC to build the infrastructure it has, and it's the largest altcoin. All of the other altcoins have much smaller infrastructures. Since about a year ago, Bitcoin's lead over Litecoin has grown, so Litecoin has failed to keep pace.

Let's define our terms here. A "peg" in this context means a SC-coin being backed by an amount of BTC. The SC maker determines this. That however does not mean that the SC maker arbitrarily sets the price of anything. Cryptocurrency exists in a free market, and all prices are determined by the market. 
As I've said a half a dozen times:
The price of a SC-coin is determined by the market, which determines how much the BTC that is backing it is worth, and how credible the backing is.


I never said a gold certificate is gold. A gold certificate is backed by gold, the same way a SC-coin is backed by BTC. The value of a SC-coin is a function of the 1) credibility of the SC and 2) the value of BTC, in the same way the value of a certificate is a function of 1) the credibility of the backer and 2) the value of gold.
My point is that backing one asset with another happens all the time in the free market, and has a lot of uses, negating your ridiculous claim that it's "unnatural", and your insinuation that it is not market-based.


Again, you're trying to change the subject, instead of addressing the point that your two claims:
* a SC maker can arbitrarily set the price of their coins, insinuating that it's not set by the market
and 
* sidechains are "unnatural"
Are false. Let's deal with these two. Stop trying to obfuscate by jumping from one set of arguments to another, without fully addressing my counter arguments.

Micropayment channels don't bloat the blockchain with micropayment transactions. The whole point of this payment method is that it allows the micropayment txs to be stored off chain, on the hard drive of the parties to the channel, with only a single tx needing to go on the chain to close the channel and settle all of the micropayments. The off-chain micropayments are essentially added up to make one normal sized transaction, saving people on tx fees and reducing the bloat on the blockchain.

If the other person was on Disqus, that was also me (my Disqus account name is DigitalAndroid).


That is true to some extent, but there are still network effects from being able to transfer bitcoin value into and out of another blockchain via a distributed protocol. It allows actors to exchange the floating value SC-coin for BTC via on-chain transactions.


True, and to add to your point: it all but eliminates the value in the altchain developer innovating in the functions which it shares with Bitcoin, namely the consensus protocol. Theoretically, one could use more than one consensus protocol: one shared with Bitcoin, and one independent, but that's a lot more complexity for questionable benefit, so unlikely to happen. 
Despite these shortcomings, I think the value of aligning interests with Bitcoin stakeholders, whilst reinforcing the digital scarcity of the original 21 million BTC supply, is substantial, for both the altchain and the cryptocurrency ecosystem in general, and could possibly make up for the limitations and complexity of a partially pegged sidechain.
The sharedrop is definitely one solution to this, but as I mentioned in the other discussion, it still leaves the possibility of a mass sell off in the future that wipes out later investors in the previously dominant cryptocurrency, that buy into it after the sharedrop. In any case, it might be the best one can expect given the difficulty of adding partial SC pegging and the complexity it adds.

I do not believe that the ability to regulate international wire transfers is why the central points of failure that are banks end up being highly regulated. In other words, a decentralized international wiring service, like Bitcoin, is not going to result in a unregulated financial system subject to free market forces. As long as the major interface between end users and the international wiring service is Trusted Third Parties, finance will be regulated.
For that reason, the blockchain needs to eventually be affordable enough for everyone to use, which means the block size limit needs to rise.


I believe that the increase in the size of the Bitcoin economy will make a tremendous amount of resources available for developing Bitcoin technology. If Bitcoin continues to artificially remain small, it risks stagnating, and dying. It needs to scale, or else much of the work done so far (Microsoft accepts Bitcoin!) will be for nought.
This artificial constraint is needlessly holding back progress. Yes, growth will be bumpy. It was the same for the internet. The internet was not perfect in 1992. But it evolved as more parties got involved and invested in its infrastructure. Exactly the same thing would happen with Bitcoin. Let's give it a chance. Get rid of the 1 MB block size limit.


First of all, there is an incentive to run a full node: helping the Bitcoin network. A lot of people take satisfaction in doing so, and that is incentive enough for them to do it.
Second, with the growth in bandwidth (50% per year for the last 20 years), the average person will be able to handle progressively larger blocks at minimal personal cost. It is the size of blocks *relative to the cost of bandwidth* that matters, not just the size of blocks in isolation. As bandwidth gets more plentiful and cheaper, the maximum size of the blocks that the average node operator will tolerate will grow.
That means the block size limit can grow at a rate that approximates the anticipated growth in bandwidth, say 40% per year to be conservative, without any reduction in the number of people running full nodes.


Don't underestimate governments and their desire to control the way money moves. 6 years is not that young anymore. It's time to give Bitcoin the freedom to grow. This artificial 1 MB block size limit needs to be lifted. It was meant to be a temporary anti-spam measure, not a permanent artificial road block to mass adoption.
And please my note my other concern about delaying mass adoption:


The best chance cryptocurrency has of achieving mass adoption is for there to be  a clear standard, with a limited coin supply, that has the digital scarcity to retain value.  Right now the technology has a chance of achieving that, because it has a dominant market leader and standard in Bitcoin. It shouldn't twiddle its thumbs and risk the market getting divided across multiple blockchains. Competing standards have historically held back other technologies, and we should not risk the same thing happening to cryptocurrency.

Not true. The fundamental economics are very straightforward: they extend the functionality that BTC enables. They increase the economic value of BTC, and threaten the value of altcoins, which seems to be your concern.


But that is not true. The value of BTC is priced by the market. You know what the value of a sidechain coin is, because it is backed by BTC. This is all very straightforward, but you're trying to obfuscate it as part of your campaign to mislead people away from an incredibly valuable innovation that would grow the Bitcoin ecosystem and increase the value of BTC.


Not true. The features are not priced at anything, the BTC backing the sidechain is. The value comes from the BTC backing. This is a 100% market phenomenon and not at all arbitrary. 


If I want to use an innovative feature on a sidechain, then I simply convert a small amount of my BTC into the SC-coin, so I can use that feature. No third party exchange needed. The small risk of the SC collapsing during the short interval that I use it is compensated by the value that the feature on the SC provides to me.


Wrong. The more the cryptocurrencey market is fragmented across different coins, the more inflation there is. It's not technically inflation, in that the coin supply of each blockchain is not increasing, but it is effectively the same as inflation, as the number of cryptocoins in contention increase as Bitcoin's market share is reduced relative to an altcoin's. 
There is afterall, limited total demand for cryptocoins. With more cryptocoins (supply), the demand is spread thinner, and the price of each cryptocoin is reduced. Increased fragmentation across blockchains with independent coin supplies therefore has the same effect as inflatioin.
This  is Economics 101, that you totally ignore, and try to obfuscate, suggesting to me that you are not concerned with bitcoin losing its value, and either not aware of the harm that devaluation does to cryptocurrency as a whole, or don't care.


Ah but they do not, because merge-mined altcoins threaten the value of bitcoin, and therefore there is more incentive for Bitcoin miners to attack them, as has happened in the past. Sidechains, given they share the same coin supply as Bitcoin, are generally beneficial to Bitcoin stakeholders, and therefore will be supported by them through benevolent merge-mining.


That's not true. It will be the price of the BTC that is backing it. Since when is backing one currency with another "fake"? You have this strange obsession with how prices should be determined, that rejects backing, and are trying to shove your weird and wrong ideas down others throats.


That's simply not true. You're again trying to mislead people. The crux of sidechains is that they allow P2P interop. This will be a basic feature.

Yes, until people stop using Bitcoin because transaction fees are too high, leading to more transactions taking place on other blockchains, and eventually, the total transaction fees earned by miners of a particular altcoin surpassing those miners of Bitcoin.
Demand for Bitcoin is not inelastic. Raise the price of using Bitcoin enough, and demand will decline. Right now, the primary reason people use Bitcoin is not its security. That's a nice benefit, but most users use it because it's cheap, and has the largest network of users, merchants, exchanges, etc. The affordability and number of users shouldn't be compromised for security. In fact, doing so will inevitably cause security to suffer too.

There's only about $1.5 trillion Euros in the world. If Bitcoin became uber successful, that's the kind of market cap it could expect. 5% of that would only be $75 billion, meaning less than Bill Gates' fortune. He wouldn't have trillions.
As for an "active business based mindset", that's not enough to grow a huge fortune at faster than global economic growth, because no individual is able to personally oversee the investment of that much wealth, the way entrepreneurs and small business people can manage smaller sums. The extremely wealthy have to look to invest in large companies, or buy highly liquid fixed income securities, both of which tend to provide a low rate of return.

I don't want to force anyone to do anything. I don't have the right.
The only thing you have a moral right to do is start a new exchange that agrees to have its funds audited by a third party organisation, and take your business to exchanges that operate like this.
You certainly don't have a right to *force* an exchange to change the way it operates to suit your preferences. Afterall, it doesn't belong to you!

Yes this is the fundamental decision that needs to be made.
Here are the reasons for which I think Bitcoin should scale:
* Bitcoin fees would skyrocket if it became a high-powered money transmitter limited to 1 MB of transaction data every 10 minutes for the entire world. Gavin has already said he wouldn't work on Bitcoin if it was an expensive network for the rich that you needed to pay $20 to use each time.
* The original vision, set out by Satoshi, is that Bitcoin would handle thousands of transactions per second. Bitcoin should stay true to its original vision. It's not fair to those who have invested years of their life into Bitcoin to suddenly change what it's meant to be.
* Technology will get exponentially better. The size of the blocks that an average internet user will be able to download and propagate using their home internet connection, and store on their hard disc, will grow larger with time. There's no need to artificially restrain Bitcoin to 1 MB.
* A Bitcoin that is restrained to 1 MB blocks will be much less competitive against altcoins, increasing the chance that Bitcoin is either replaced as the dominant cryptocurrency, or that the cryptocurrency market fragments across multiple mutually incompatible blockchains.

If that much commerce were occurring on the network, you wouldn't need to be a miner to earn income. There would be millions of lite clients that query full nodes for tx data, and these full nodes could charge microamounts to serve the data. Obviously full node software would need to be changed to make this the default behavior, and that's easier said than done, but there's nothing technically stopping this from happening in the future.
Also, if there were in fact an average of 3,000 legitimate txs being done on the network per second, that would mean the economy as a whole would be on the order of a thousand times larger than it is now, meaning hundreds of millions of additional users, increasing the likelihood of individuals with high-end connections, who could affordably run a full node, joining the network.

No, he is talking about the price of the SC-coin. He's claiming that the price of a SC-coin is arbitrarily set by the SC-creator. It's part of his case that SC-coins exist outside of the market, and that Bitcoiners should therefore reject them and not allow other Bitcoiners to use them.


Price doesn't have to float relative to BTC if it is backed by BTC. The price of gasoline is highly correlated to the price of petroleum, because it's a derivative of petroleum, like how SC-coins are a derivative of BTC. If the demand for gasoline goes down relative to the demand for petroleum, the price of gasoline won't go down. Instead, the supply of gasoline will go down, as people use less petroleum to produce gasoline. Similarly, if the demand for a SC-coin goes down, then the supply of that SC-coin will dwindle, as people stop converting their BTC into the SC-coin, and the SC-coin holders convert their coin back into BTC.

Bitcoin would go a long way to producing a free market banking and payment system. Transaction fees are extremely low, and transactions are censor-proof. These two features combine to create the basis for a free market in finance.


7000 computers crunching the same computation is not what would give it scalability. That's what gives it resiliency and censor-resistance. What would give it scalability is those 7000 computers crunching a larger computation that allows for more transactions to be processed through the Bitcoin network every second.


That's a different objective, and a worthy one. However, a large number of transactions on a common platform (Bitcoin) is important to making electronic cash widely accessible. Open Transactions and off-chain micropayment channels are great additions, but they are not electronic cash. They can provide different qualities, that have a lot of value, but that's a separate issue from giving the world, and not just a few thousand people, the means to use electronic cash.


I am also on the ground trying to get merchants to accept Bitcoin, but I have lost my enthusiam, because I know the 1 MB block size limit is there. I can't confidently promote something that, at the protocol level, can't do more than 3.5 transactions per second.
If Bitcoin scaled, a lot of the problems you see would start to be addressed in a much more rapid way. A larger economy brings more development resources, and more minds, to solving its problems, and refining its technology. The first step, however, is lifting the 1 MB block size limit, and replacing it with something that scales automatically, rather than at the behest of the core developers being able to periodically obtain the difficult to achieve community consensus.

It is not. His comment does not address the fact that if I want to harm myself by using an exchange that doesn't meet a government body's standards for safety, I have a moral right to do that, under the principles that underpin liberal democracy.

The idea that people should have their freedom limited for their (supposed) own good is disgusting to my sensibilities. You may as well get rid of democracy while you're at it.

Yes, but the way you present it makes it sound like I don't want alternative blockchain developers to be allowed to innovate and add new features to their projects. I do, but I want Bitcoin to adopt any feature they do. The reason why I want a dominant Bitcoin is that one of the essential qualities of a successful cryptocurrency is digital scarcity. 
Without patent protection or government monopolies, the open source cryptocurrency space faces the risk of gradual fragmentation across an ever increasing number of blockchains. If these blockchains have independent coin supplies, this is essentially the same as inflation, but potentially at a rate far exceeding that of fiat currencies.
If one cryptocurrency manages to position itself to credibly maintain the lionshare of the market over the long run, through its network effect and ability to incorporate new innovations, then digital scarcity will be secured, and cryptocoins will have a chance of becoming a major asset class in the global economy. Bitcoin, as the first and largest distributed cryptocurrency, has the best chance of being that cryptocurrency. 
If it were to be supplanted, with an associated mass sell-off and devaluation, I believe faith in the ability of cryptocurrencies to preserve value in the long run would be seriously damaged, as people would assume any successor to Bitcoin could face the fate that Bitcoin did, so my preference is that Bitcoin remain the standard and strengthen its position as such.

This is a very simple disagreement.
You claim that:
* a SC maker can arbitrarily set the price of their coins, insinuating that it's not set by the market 
This is false. In reality, the price of a SC-coin is determined 100% by the market, which determines how much the BTC that is backing it is worth, and how credible the backing is.
* sidechains are "unnatural"
This is false. In reality, they're no different than gold certificates being backed by gold. It's a 100% market phenomenon.
Your basic arguments are absolutely false and misleading, and instead of trying to show me otherwise, you try to change the subject to a new set of arguments.

Gavin is proposing an immediate increase of the block size limit to 20 MB, and then a 40% increase every year. That would mean 16.7 GB blocks (or ~58,000 tx/sec) in 2035.
If we start at 1 MB instead, at the end of the 20 year period, it would only be 900 MB/block, and this in 2035, when bandwidth will be light years ahead of what it is now. The block size limit might be comically frugal for consumer-grade internet connections in the 2030s. So this might be erring too much on the side of caution. Then again, achieving community consensus is hard.

They're not "working with a second crypto hash function". The Scrypt hashing algorithm remains unchanged. What the second dev team is doing is porting upgrades to Bitcoin core over to their own copycat client. It's essentially a bitcoin 


It's true that it's nice to have a less valuable blockchain that independent teams can develop and experiment on. But imo, it's not worth the inflation of the cryptocoin supply, and the risk it poses to the credibility of bitcoin's digital scarcity, on which all of its value is reliant on. When, hopefully, sidechain functionality is developed, then sidechains will be a better place to experiment with forks of Bitcoin.

Full nodes don't need to be run by people with average connection speeds. If over 3,000 txs are being processed per second, full nodes could probably earn income serving SPV proofs to lite clients, and be able to afford higher end connections. 
And in any case, 3000 tps, or 1 GB blocks, are not going to be enabled in the near future. By the time they are (if they are), ave connection speeds will be much higher. There is nothing to indicate that the investments being made to improve broadband connection bandwidth and speed will slow down in the coming decades. If anything, fast internet is becoming a more important part of national economic policies, and its development will be increasingly encouraged by governments.

You're right that we shouldn't panic. I am however promoting that the community make this a priority.
It's much harder to plan when you don't know what the architecture of Bitcoin will look like.
If the market knows that Bitcoin will be allowed to scale to 20 MB blocks, which would then increase by 20 percent a year for 20 years for example, it will have a clear frame of reference for projecting how much activity will take place on the Bitcoin blockchain, and have fewer moving parts / blank spaces to plan around. 
Having a defined present and future architecture/protocol is absolutely essential IMO. For a consensus to be reached, there needs to be a lot of discussion on potential replacements for the 1 MB block size limit, and the trade-offs of each.

There should be no static limit. Some bloat control mechanism is needed to discourage spam, and that might be a dynamic limit that automatically adjusts to maintain a constant level of fee pressure, but anyone who wants to use Bitcoin, and is willing to pay a modest fee, should be able to. No segment of the world population should be arbitrarily excluded by a static hard limit. 
Excluding people from directly participating in the blockchain with their own private keys is a form of centralisation, that is worse than excluding people from running a fully validating node. As long as the per KB fee rate is enough to limit uses of the blockchain to economically valuable activities, I don't see the full node count dwindling and posing a systemic risk to Bitcoin as an uncensored global network, as the ave block size grows.

Our current financial system is built on a foundation of trusted third parties. Moving gold gave way to moving bills of credits issued by trusted third parties. That made the system easy to monopolize through the application of force on the TTPs.
Bitcoin is built on a foundation of a public blockchain and global consensus algorithm. It cannot be censored. The only way to stop it is to make the unrestricted use of the currency illegal. The way to prevent that is to make it ubiqitious before governments move to stop it. Similarly, running a server will always be an unlicensed activity in the liberal democracies, because the internet became ubiquitous as an unrestricted communication platform before the political system could move to ban unrestricted participation in it.


I'm arguing the exact opposite. 


It is encryption, and not Tor alone, that allows someone to escape censorship laws in their country, and encrypted data channels will be available to Bitcoin users no matter what the tx throughput is. The best way to fight censorship is to increase the size of the crowd using Bitcoin. If only 1 million people used the internet in Russia or China, it would be easy to prevent individuals from accessing censored information. The fact that a vast segment of the populations in these countries uses the internet makes it easier and less risky for individuals in these countries to circumvent censorship laws.

Because every node can't connect to every other node. Even if it could, there would be no way for it to know how much data other nodes are transmitting.

I didn't see it explained how bitcoin fees make it difficult/expensive to implement anonymity.


Maybe I misread it on my first reading, but I saw your post say that strong anonymity is impossible with the Bitcoin protocol. In terms of the current implementations not being fully anonymous, I completely agree.
My only comment was on the impression I got, perhaps mistakenly, that your post was saying that there will never be good anonymity in Bitcoin. 


The fees are larger with larger transactions, but they are still extremely affordable for the size of transaction needed to provide strong anonymity in Bitcoin.

That's different of course. That's sort of like fraud. You're warning people of a danger that doesn't exist, which causes them to take actions that subject everyone around them to risk of being physically injured. These extreme examples used to try to justify regulations are so far removed from the reality of regulations, which is things like making it illegal to operate an exchange that doesn't meet some set of standards created by a third party government body interjecting itself into the economy and people's private transactions.

1. Bitcoin proper is almost assured to earn several times more fees for miners than any of the sidechains, because, due to the sidechain architecture, it is a far more secure blockchain, and would be centrally located in the Bitcoin sidechain ecosystem, making it a hub in transferring BTC value between sidechains.
2. If a sidechain ever did manage to get more transaction fees than the main chain, it would almost certainly be a fully pegged sidechain with currency that is totally backed by BTC. What this means is that any attack on Bitcoin proper would threaten the value of the sidechain-coin fees that miners earn.


That's a risk factor for sidechains, not Bitcoin proper. It does not harm Bitcoin to have the option of using sidechains. The only BTC at risk in sidechains are those people voluntarily risk in sidechains.

That's a fair point that the conflict will be less if the blocks are already hitting the 1 MB block limit. However, the disagreement over what should replace the 1 MB block limit will be the same whether blocks are at 500 kb or they're full. I think time will only makes this particular disagreement worse. For that reason, I think the sooner we push to get an automatically scaling block size limit put in place, the better.


The larger the Bitcoin community gets, the harder it is to fork.
The longer the 1 MB block size limit stays in place, the more resistance there will be to get rid o fit.
Also, on a different subject:
the longer Bitcoin takes to scale, the more likely it will stagnate, and/or that the market will fragment across a bunch of altcoins.

You CANNOT earn value while attacking Bitcoin by merge-mining a sidechain. That's what matters, not whether you can earn BTC. An attack on Bitcoin would cause the value of BTC to plummet, making any earnings from the sidechain worthless.
And this non-threat would only emerge IF sidechain fees exceeded fees from mining Bitcoin proper, which, given the trendous advantages that Bitcoin proper would have over its sidechains, is unlikely.


I've researched the economics and I think it's an absolutely good idea as it would simultaneously do the following:
* Increase miners fees and by extension Bitcoin's security
* Increase the size and functionality of the Bitcoin ecosystem, making mass adoption more likely.
* Increase the utility of BTC, which would increase its value, which would both increase miner fees and network security AND increase BTC's liquidity
* Prevent fragmentation of the cryptocurrency market across different blockchains with independent coin supplies, by allowing the Bitcoin ecosystem to quickly incorporate new innovations, thus providing the cryptocurrency market with the standardization and digital scarcity it needs to succeed. 
Mass adoption of Bitcoin and an increase in the resources invested in Bitcoin's mining infrastucture would make Bitcoin more secure. It would also have all sorts of indirect benefits, like attracting more funding and volunteers to develop more decentralized mining software like P2Pool that would further secure Bitcoin.
There's a reason why those contributing most to Bitcoin core development are extremely supportive of sidechains. They understand the technology, have demonstrated their commitment to the project through investments of their time, and they conclude that sidechains would be overwhelmingly beneficial for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I don't know what ftfu means..


Here we're discussing the risk that miners will attack Bitcoin proper while earning fees merge mining a sidechain. I provided reasoning for why this is unlikely to be a threat.
 
Are you suggesting the 'attack' will be in the form of miners not allowing BTC to flow to/from a particular sidechain?
Such an attack would only affect the sidechain, not Bitcoin proper. If you're arguing that the worst thing that can happen if sidechain functionality were added to Bitcoin would be that Bitcoin miners would prevent Bitcoin users from using a sidechain, I don't see how this worst case outcome is worst than the null position, which is that there is no sidechain functionality, and no sidechains period.


Source for Blockstream intending for sidechains to be used by governments?
I think it's extremely unlikely a sidechain can get larger than Bitcoin, due to advantages that Bitcoin proper will always have over sidechains that are inherent to the sidechain architecture. 
Even if a sidechain did somehow get larger than Bitcoin, it would very likely have a fully pegged currency that is 100 percent backed by BTC, meaning miners couldn't attack it without attacking the value of their sidechain-coins.

I think Circle has it right. Bitcoin is an excellent way to transfer value quickly and at low cost, but its volatility versus fiat means that it's better for the average person to hold fiat. 
Where Bitcoin's much larger market cap relative to altcoins gives it value is in making it less volatile, and therefore incurring lower slippage costs during the conversion into and out of fiat, and making it more liquid, with more places around the world where it can be exchanged into and out of fiat.
Circle is utilizing the unique strengths of both dollars and BTC to create a superior payment system.

This is not the current architecture of Bitcoin, as I understand it. Everyone doesn't need to know about every transaction. Full node operators can become an increasingly small percentage of the userbase, as the userbase gets proportionally larger, resulting in the number of full node operators remaining constant. This is obviously how Bitcoin would scale. This is probably how it should happen IMO. It's not going to end up looking like Visa or PayPal. The only barrier to entry to becoming a full node operator is technical resources, which is fundamentally different than the admission-controlled TTP model.
The idea of every Bitcoin user being able to run a full node at scale is not part of the [original vision]( of Bitcoin:


And there has been no community-wide agreement that the 'everyone runs their own node' maxim should become the new vision and design goal.

That's possible. I've observed that Bitcoin maximalism, which I'm defining as a belief that the digital scarcity of Bitcoin's currency, established by the combination of Bitcoin's fixed money supply and its market dominance, is important for the success of cryptocurrency, is motivating much of it the activity that has kept copycat coins at bay, but it might be secondary to "opposition to inflation without innovation" as the cause of the phenomenon.


Yes, that is possible, but all other indicators being equal, a larger market cap is likely going to have more T and N than a smaller one, for several reasons:
* a large market cap invites more trading activity, which increases liquidity, which in turn increases the utility of the currency for T 
* a large market cap attracts media attention and captures the public's imagination, leading to more interest in cryptocurrency, which leads to more T and N
* a large market cap leads to a more secure, and therefore useful, platform for T and N
A larger cap (S) is also good in its own right, as it means people are able to store more of their wealth in the form of a distributed asset that can be easily transported and potentially much more effectively secured from confiscation and theft than traditional assets.


One minor counter-point is that in the long run, a larger market cap, by encouraging growth in the cryptocurrency community, could lead to more innovation that reduces centralization in mining (e.g. P2Pool, Sidechains, Sidechain P2Pools, etc). That's on the speculative side of predictions though.


The reason I believe distributed currency could have different requirements for success than the private currencies Hayek envisioned is that it's unbacked, which is necessary for it to be a distributed. The lack of backing leaves only its scarcity as a source of value. The distributed nature of Bitcoin is its most important quality, and I believe the benefits it would provide over the type of currencies described by Hayek, outweigh the additional economic rent that it allows its holders to extract through deflation.


Ah yes thanks.




It's possible, but I get the sense that much of the big investments by VCs are being motivated by the perception that the success of Bitcoin is evidence that its underlying concept of distributed currency is sound, and not vulnerable to the outcome of hyper inflation that many [critics]( of Bitcoin, and by extension critics of the model of distributed digital tokens as currency, have predicted for it.
If it had failed to maintain its market share, and that had resulted in a collapse in the combined market cap of cryptocoins, I think that faith in the concept would have evaporated.


There will always be blockchains, but I don't know if there will ever be a widely adopted, low volatility distributed currency, and I believe the failure of the first stock of 21 million distributed currency tokens, after it has attracted the attention of the world's technological elite, would make the outcome less likely.

I believe that Bitcoin is not as similar to gold as you imply. Gold is molecularly unique. Its properties cannot be mimicked by another element. This is not so with Bitcoin. Other blockchains can mimic its properties. There's no limit to the number of blockchains that can crop up.
What gives Bitcoin value, and distinguishes it from copycat blockchains, is its:
N = network effect (number of users)
V = transactional volume (non-speculative demand)
S = security (network hashrate)
All three of these would suffer if the use of Bitcoin as a transactional currency declines. Less V will result in fewer transaction fees, which will reduce S. It will also reduce N, which will reduce its value, resulting in lower transaction fees, which would further reduce S.
Bitcoin's utility as a store of value goes hand in hand with its utility as a medium of exchange.
edmundedgar argues this point well in Bitcointalk:












and here he explains why Bitcoin needs to be a large economic player, in terms of number of users and businesses reliant on it, to be secure from government attack:








To add to all this, the original Bitcoin white paper, says that the purpose of Bitcoin is to allow people send money to each other directly, without going through a financial institution.
Limiting the blocksize so that transaction fees go to $20 will mean the majority of transactions will have to go through financial intermediaries, or at the very least, use 'Hub and Spoke' micropayment channel schemes, where the Hub plays a similar role as a financial institution, and is privy to all transactions a person makes, thus eliminating much financial privacy for end-users.


Why would they have to divide their resources among 2 protocols? Are you assuming that Bitcoin will divide into two networks if there is a hard fork to raise the block size limit? I think that's an unjustified assumption, considering a hard fork will only be done if and when there is a strong consensus among core developers, large Bitcoin businesses, and average Bitcoin users.

1. The market price factors in growth potential in the future. The uncertainty over the 1 MB block size limit reduces this future growth potential.
2. The 1 MB block size limit affects the behavior of participants in the Bitcoin economy. For example, a 10X growth in transaction volume is simply not possible in a short time, making any business model contingent on such growth impossible. The impediment this puts in place to mass adoption affects transaction volumes and the price. 
In some ways, the 1 MB block size limit is a self-fulfilling prophecy. As long as it's in place, initiatives that would cause rapid growth in transaction volumes are put off, leading to transaction volumes growing slowly, and thus far, remaining under 1 MB/block.

Yes, I personally have lost enthusiasm for recruiting merchants, because I don't know what will happen once 1 MB block size limit is reached, or if there is a one time increase of the limit, what will happen when the next limit is reached. Each hard fork to increase the limit is risky (there could be a split in the community), and not assured that it will go through, and I'm aware of that, and that reduces my confidence in the ability of the Bitcoin network to remain low cost for consumers and merchants.
If there were an automatically scaling block size limit, not dependent on difficult to achieve political consensus within the Bitcoin community, I would be aggressively encouraging merchants to adopt Bitcoin.

In any case, if some amount of collective 'harm' justifies infringing someone's rights, then any amount of collective harm can justify it. It's wrong to prohibit alcohol based on the argument that others are affected by alcoholism. The 'harm' that an alcoholic inflicts on the collective is within their right to inflict. A person has a right to destroy their life and productive capacity, even if others are worse off as a result.

Some features are only advantageous in some situations, and disadvantageous in others, so it makes sense to contain these features in separate blockchains. Other features are experimental, and are risky to use in Bitcoin proper without more testing in a lower value blockchain. Currency interoperability with Bitcoin via sidechain convertibility just makes these experimental blockchains more accessible to Bitcoin users.
Separate pegged blockchains (aka sidechains) is also a boon to scalability. It allows for more efficient storage of transaction data, by  having it split up into different sections, and each section stored by the group that most actively uses it, and by splitting up the load of transaction validation, it reduces the resource requirements for participating in transaction validation, allowing the Bitcoin ecosystem to scale without decentralization suffering.

If you can't see the value in that, and in giving the Bitcoin ecosystem an effective tool for competing with altcoins, then I don't know what to tell you.
The 'mining incentive' argument is nonsense IMO, as it would only increase the incentive to mine the Bitcoin blockchain, and possibly substantially increase mining revenues, which is vitally important given Bitcoin's block subsidy is halving every four year, and the blockchain's security will become wholly dependent on transaction fees.


Your claim that there is no benefit in being able to use bitcoin backed coins in alternative blockchain with innovative new features, and in giving Bitcoin miners a means to earn more revenue while mining Bitcoin, by merge-mining sidechains, is not realism. It's stubborn anti-SC bias.

We've never had pure libertarianism or pure socialism. We've had libertarianism-ish economies, and socialism-ish economies.
We've had libertarian-ish forms of government for extended periods of time, and the long term consequences have been positive. The Western world basically pioneered the idea of private property and individual liberty, and has been the strongest adherent of these principles, and it has been generally more successful than the rest of the world over the last several centuries. We have not had a long term experiment with socialism-ish economics. 
The longest experiment ended in failure, when the Soviet Union went bankrupt. Europe has only had its social welfare largesse for 35-40 years. These policies have ALREADY failed in Southern Europe, and here you are promoting it to the rest of the world, because Northern Europe seems to be a decent place to live at the moment, once you ignore all the control the people are under.

Exactly. Getting it over with now so that the Bitcoin protocol is scalable in the future without another hard fork would remove the last major element of centralization in Bitcoin, which is the need to depend on the centralized governing structure of client developers, major stakeholders and opinion makers that are needed for pushing through hard forks.

Well terrorists are harder to identify when everyone is using encryption and encrypted data is filling the telecom links. With a ban on encryption, the state security apparatus can dedicate significant resources to monitoring and investigating the small number of individuals who defy the ban and send encrypted data. Therefore, the argument that encryption can aid terrorists has merit. 
The real question is why are we safer with one organisation having the power to know everyone's private information. It's a terrible design for creating a secure society.

On the one hand, banning unrestricted participation ('regulations')  keeps small entrepreneurs out of an industry. If the Bitlicense were adopted by all 50 US states for example, a start-up would need $1 million just for licensing fees, to operate a hosted Bitcoin wallet business in the US. This stacks the odds heavily in favour of big companies.
On the other hand, the penalties for not complying with this type of ban don't provide enough of a deterrence to bad behaviour to prevent things like the LIBOR scandal:

Your argument is an attempt to mislead, as you claim that SC-makers can arbitrarily set the price of something. In reality, the only way to arbitrarily price something is through coercion. This would be a voluntary market system, so there would be no arbitrary pricing. In a voluntary market, in which SCs would exist, all prices are based on what the market determines. In the case of SC-coins, the price is determined by what the market prices the BTC backing the coins at, and how credible it perceives the backing to be. It's no different than Gold certificates, and Gold. There is nothing "unnatural" about this.

Without an ability to securely transmit sensitive information over the internet, I believe e-commerce would not be possible on any significant scale, and the internet in general would be a vastly less useful tool. If the clipper chip was in every communication device, I can't imagine people relying on telecommunication as heavily as they did in the real time line. I don't think when this economic impact is viewed cumulatively, "trillions of dollars worth of value" is hyperbole or a bad guess. 


Privacy makes a currency more secure to use, because it allows you to use it without the risk of personal information leaking to un-invited third parties like hackers and extortionists. In the fiat world, kidnappings and ransom demands happen all the time, and require that criminals have knowledge that someone is wealthy. We just don't know about it because victims often don't go to the police or do so after they've paid the ransom and ask that it not be publicized. Less extreme examples are homes being targeted for burglary and people being targeted for identity theft when criminal elements discover someone is wealthy. I believe the leaking of private financial information by a currency significantly limits its utility.

@_date: 2015-01-02 17:20:46


I think it's done pretty well, but as you say, it's far from perfect. Litecoin for instance basically did not innovate and is one of the largest altcoins. Dogecoin innovated in use of a meme. They deserve something for that, but $17, and at one point $42, million for their clone-coins?
Furthermore, the reason why Bitcoin, which I contend is far and away the most innovative of the bunch, in pioneering distributed consensus and creating the cryptocurrency asset class, has a market share largely proportional to its market cap, and the reason why Litecoin is not larger than it is, is because of a conscious effort by individuals to discourage the use of Bitcoin copycats, which you also cited as a factor in preventing fragmentation:


What I'd add is that this pressure is not inevitable. It's due to the peculiar belief set of cryptocurrency users. In the case of the dominance of Bitcoin, it's largely due to Bitcoin maximalism.
In other words, posts like my OP are part of the evangelism that discourages fragmentation. Of course, other factors are also inhibiting fragmentation. At this stage, I'd guess Bitcoin's network effect is the largest factor.


The market cap is a fairly good proxy for adoption. If the combined market were lower, it would likely mean cryptocurrency technology were adopted by a smaller percentage of the population. That would mean less development on cryptocurrency infrastructure.
I'm also not perfectly fine with governments retaining the ability to tax the population, for the interest of their economic elite, via central bank inflation, when we have the opportunity to create a large cap asset class that is distributed.
More importantly, there is a considerable possibility that having a large market cap is the only way in which cryptocurrency, and its infrastructure, can be useful enough for mass adoption. For example, a larger market cap means a more secure blockchain, which is an essential quality if it is going to be the basis of the global financial system. There's also no guarantee that there are robust alternatives to a free floating value for distributed currency, and if there aren't, then large market cap is essential for reducing the volatility of distributed currency. 


Well, that's good, but culture is not guaranteed to always be amiable to innovation. 


LTC got to $39 on BTC-e in late Nov 2013, about 4% of the BTC price. The market was valuing LTC's eventual coin supply at 16% of BTC's at the time. There appeared to be a real possibility that LTC supporters would succeed in making it the "silver to Bitcoin's gold". Some of the developments at the time included Coinbase expressing openness to supporting Litecoin and hiring Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, and MtGox annoucing it would support LTC. Without the very strong adherence to Bitcoin maximalism among a large subset of cryptocurrency users, and the consequent intense campaign against fragmentation, that countered the campaign by Litecoin speculators, this could have unfolded.
I believe the risk of a total collapse in market, VC and technical interest in cryptocurrency would have been far greater if that scenario had occurred.


Ripple didn't really compete with Bitcoin from what I observed. It didn't serve the same markets, or have a similar function. The reported market cap was also not seen as particularly credible by many, because the small share of the total XRP that was actively trade and the thin trade volume meant the well financed company behind the currency could manipulate trading to engineer a higher market price.


Fair point. On thinking on it some more, I believe the value accrued to holders of a deflationary currency is a type of economic rent, and therefore inefficient.
However, I believe Bitcoin's suppression of economic rent from other sources through the ability it gives to people to bypass financial gatekeepers far outweighs the deflationary economic rent it would allow its holders to collect, and that the fixed money supply of Bitcoin is likely necessary for it to supplant the current financial system. 
I also believe that even with the best efforts of Bitcoin maximalists, there will still be effective inflation in the cryptocoin supply. The much greater risk, I believe, is in cryptocurrency being too inflationary to compete with centralized monetary institutions, and as a consequence, the legacy gatekeepers remaining in place. 


That is why I think it's appropriate to have slight inflation to compensate innovation in cryptocurrency, and why I floated the idea of sidechains with currency that's partially backed by bitcoin and partially backed by new coins to earn their makers seigniorage.

That's not a fair comparison, as it goes into the arena of your responsibility to "be a good neighbour", and provide what's essentially emergency services in exchange for the same should you find yourself in a similar position. If you weren't chosen to make the lever decision, someone else would have, and they would likely pull the lever because they can easily get back the $20 plus interest from the person they saved. So this expectation, that you will be helpful in a critical situation like this where saving someone's life costs you nearly nothing or nothing, is implicitly there in society, as a price of you taking the space of someone who would have a minimum amount of generosity of spirit. 
That's not comparable to a situation where you refuse to do something most will not do, which is take a financial hit to give aid to people living in poor regions of the world.
But to answer your hypothetical, the person who pulls the level that kills someone, to get $20, is much more evil than the one who doesn't pay $20 to pull a lever to save a man's life.
We have a real moral comparison we can use that doesn't have all of these other factors: an ordinary person who forgoes charity, and a serial killer who robs dozens of people of their lives. It's clear that the serial killer is evil, and the ordinary person is not. If you claim otherwise, then you're using a different definition of evil than me and nearly everybody else (as evidenced by the lack of a life sentence for not giving to charity), and therefore this debate cannot be meaningful.


No they do not. Underlings are notoriously unreliable and without management and supervision, don't fulfill their job responsibilities. The world is not as stacked in favour of those with money as you imagine. Compare Bill Gates when he was first starting Microsoft to Gates in the 2000s. Why couldn't he continue to double his company's revenues every year like he was in the early 1980s? Because underling don't cut it. They don't care about the company, and the more of them you have, the less attention you can give to each in managing them. 
Put another way: the growth in his income slowed as his fortune increased, because he had less time for each additional underling he took on, and no more time to personally do the projects himself.

These devices only do one operation: calculate a SHA256 hash. They cannot be used for any other computing related tasks. Their only other potential use is as a heater.
Here's an example of an ASIC hashing computer:

Anyone who wants to use Bitcoin, should be able to do so by paying a modest fee. The 1 MB limit was put place with the intention of preventing denial-of-service attacks and bloating from spam, and NOT to throttle the volume of legitimate transactions recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. The hard limit was intended to be raised as the ave block size approached it. As far as I can see, without consensus on changing the purpose of the 1 MB hard limit into a tool to implement an economic policy of throttling legitimate tx volume, it violates Bitcoin's social contract to keep the 1 MB hard limit in place as the block size approaches it.
@_date: 2015-05-08 06:28:01


So couldn't the default be used to control the block size, instead of the inflexible hard limit?
Also, couldn't the drop in full nodes be explained by the migration to SPV clients and web wallets resulting from their greater availability (e.g. a large number of mobile wallets have been released since 2012), and might not wider adoption, enabled by larger blocks, lead to an increase in the full node count? In 2009 and 2010, the full node count was increasing along with the block size for example.


The problem with a smaller hard limit increase is the centralisation and uncertainty that comes with having to rely on the devs to organise a hard fork on a frequent basis. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:22:31
Yes, a de facto hard limit can be widely advertised, and would act like a hard limit in being strictly observed by all participants. However it would not be a real hard limit, which would give it the advantage of being modifiable without a hard fork.

Actually the two terms I used were 'mass adoption' and 'global mass adoption', and I was only being more specific in the latter because I quoted a specific block size of 130 MB. Lower levels of mass adoption still require larger than 1 MB blocks, making my initial comment completely accurate.

That's simply not true.


That is not true. Please provide this mathematical proof if it exists. You will not because you have absolutely no proof. You're full of hot air.


The way to centralize Bitcoin is to force the majority of the population to use centralized nodes/online-wallets, by limiting on-chain tx throughput so that it's impossible for more than the smallest percentage of the population to use them. The idea that any throughput above 2 KB/s will "centralize Bitcoin" is preposterous.

I think the block size limit might be the last contentious issue. That it would create a problem was foreseen soon after the limit was put in place, five years ago. Sidechains don't require a hard fork to implement, just a soft fork, and one that's much less controversial than the change in the block size limit. As for mining surviving block reward halving, the block reward will never be increased, so increasing bitcoin inflation will never be proposed.

The first statement was a point about economies of scale in pool operation improving with larger block sizes, which, for the umpteenth time, is you suggesting that one undesireable outcome of a larger average block size is larger pools.

The Bitcoin economy would not have had as much progress if it weren't for the failures. We've had thousands of ventures, and have learned a lot from all of them, including the failures. The result is a more vigilant and educated community, and incredible innovation. 
We now have ASICs, numerous exchanges, sites offering bitcoin derivatives, tip bots, tens of millions of dollars of venture capital funding in Bitcoin projects, major retail adoption, and half a dozen wallet implementations and paper wallet generators. 
While we had major exchange breaches in 2011, we've had no major breaches in 2013 or so far in 2014. 
With your regulatory morass in place (in the name of consumer protection), the progress on developing on all these fronts would have occurred much more slowly. The Bitcoin ecosystem would be stuck at the two year mark at this point. The economy would be too small to attract venture capitalists to fund the creation of regulated services, and would be prohibited from creating cheaper unregulated services, like MtGox circa 2011, that would be needed to grow it.
The consumer is better for the progress having happened, and no one was harmed except those who ventured into this experimental new economy and knowingly risked their money on it.

You keep moving from one nonsensical argument to another. I'm sticking with this basic point, to keep the debate focused:
You claim that a SC maker can arbitrarily price their coins, which is not true. The price of a SC-coin is determined 100% by the market, which determines how much the BTC that is backing it is worth, and how credible the backing is.
You claim sidechains are "unnatural", when they're no different than gold certificates being backed by gold. It's a totally market phenomenon.

There is nothing in the Bitcoin protocol that prevents better privacy, contrary to what this post claims. This post is an advertisement for darkcoin, not an impartial analysis.
Let's look at some of the claims:


This is solved by requiring uniform denominations for the inputs and outputs of a CoinShuffle transaction, and by wallets using Merge Avoidance.
If Bitcoin wallets used the convention of using a base 2 denomination system (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.. Satoshis), any Bitcoin value could be efficiently sent (meaning sent without requiring too many transactions) while still using denominations generic enough to be able to find a set of matching denominations for a CoinShuffle transaction.


Doing the above and also segregating anonymous UTXOs from non-anonymous UTXOs solves this.


This requires more research, but I believe adding minimum Coin Age requirements for inputs from fellow mixers makes DOS and Sybil attacks costly and unsustainable.
@_date: 2015-01-26 00:17:27
I don't believe you will need 17 rounds of mixing to get good anonymity if Bitcoin wallets use a standard set of denominations and merge avoidance. The current state of privacy technology in Bitcoin leaves a lot of room for improvement and is not the limit of what the protocol allows.

Exactly. It's just a concept at this point, and has not been tested yet. We may find that it's not ideal for some types of transactions. It's good to have various options and not put all of our scaling eggs in one basket. 
Multiple scaling solutions can also complement each other. For example, if on-chain txs are cheap (e.g. fees of $0.02), it could give users of the Lightning Network more flexibility to change which hubs they form direct connections to, because it would mean they incur a lower charge when switching over. 
Even with cheap on-chain txs, it would still be in a user's interest to use LN txs when possible, since its fees would be much lower than $0.02 (maybe 1/100th that), but having relatively affordable on-chain txs to fall back on makes for a more a fluid and flexible LN that gives end-users more control.

@_date: 2015-05-21 07:33:23
It should be theoretically unlimited IMHO. However txs of amounts of BTC that have a low real world value and txs that don't pay fees that meet a certain threshold, shouldn't be allowed. Also, the block size limit should automatically increase in reaction to increased demand, but slowly, to give full node operators time to upgrade their hardware.
If an average of $1 billion worth of fee paying txs want to use the blockchain per block, and they are all greater than a certain real world value, they should all be allowed. 
I think full node count will remain constant as long as the real world value to data size ratio of the average tx remains constant, and I think full node count is all that's required to keep the network secure and trustlessly accessible, not the ability of the average person to run a full node. Of course I could be wrong, but best guesses is the best we can do when it comes to scenarios that we can't test.

@_date: 2015-05-31 23:59:33


By this logic, the blocksize should be reduced to 1 KB. Making a general claim about the effect of one factor on another, does not help us agree on a value. We need to quantify how much decentralization will be sacrificed by a certain amount of tx data, and much we are willing to give up, otherwise we have no basis to judge whether the block size limit should be 1 KB, 1 MB, or 1 GB.
The other factors affected by larger blocks also need to be taken into consideration. For one, it can allow more people to use Bitcoin, which increases the number of people with an economic stake in the network, and economic incentive to run a fully validating node. Right now, 5,000 people out of 7,000,000,000 run a full node, because the portion of the world population with an economic stake in the network is so low. In this respect, the block size limit, that limits participation in the Bitcoin network, harms decentralization.

Miners don't audit their blocks right now. They let the pool do it. It's not a situation that can get any worse, and be used an excuse to not allow Bitcoin to scale.

You're right, thanks for the correction.


When people are forced to use other ledgers, it breaks the seamlessness of the Bitcoin economy. Walmart isn't going to integrate Bitcoin into its pos system if the main network can only handle 3 tx/s and the rest have to go through trusted third party Bitcoin processors that Walmart needs to individually integrate with, and end-user wallets need to be configured to work with. Off-chain databases are also sources of centralization (look at Coinbase and its freezing of accounts due to the  regulatory risks it faces as a centralized transaction ledger). 
Sidechains don't currently exist and suffer from some of the same problems above. I do want sidechains implemented, but they're not a full substitute for a more scalable Bitcoin main blockchain.

My take:
The limited block size advocates usually make these two points:
* larger blocks will reduce the number of nodes. Peter Todd makes this point at 10:32, when he gives an example that if there were 1 TB blocks, the number of nodes would drop
While this is certainly true in some scenarios, this is not necessarily the case under all conditions. It is entirely possible that a smooth run-up to 1 TB blocks could be associated with no change in full node count, IF the transaction data that the 1 TB blocks consist of represents real-world transactions that pay fees. The counter-acting force to reducing node count here would be increasing economic significance of Bitcoin as the block size increases. 1 TB blocks would mean 6 million tps, which is **60 times the current total transaction throughput of the world**. A Bitcoin blockchain that is used by a market 60 times bigger than the entire world economy would very likely have hundreds of thousands of larger parties that could both afford multi GB/s broadband connections, and have an economic interest in running a full node to validate their transactions.
* For Bitcoin to remain decentralized, it needs to be possible to run a full node on a typical computer
This assumes that the percentage of end-users able to participate in the Bitcoin blockchain, meaning be able to use their own private key to create and propagate a transaction, is a less important quality of decentralization than the percentage of end users able to validate the Bitcoin blockchain. 
This is because, ultimately, due to technological constraints, Bitcoin can only have two out of three of the following qualities: [consumer participation (access), consumer validation, global adoption]( To choose consumer validation as the metric of decentralization means holding the assumption that under global adoption scenarios, it is more decentralized for everyone to be able to validate the Bitcoin blockchain than everyone to be able to use their own private keys to move BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain.
I would argue that those who do not directly participate in Bitcoin, would have little to no economic interest in validating the Bitcoin blockchain. If, due to limits on block space, only 50,000 bank-sized entities are transacting BTC on a regular basis, it's reasonable to assume that very few parties outside this set will bother validating the blockchain. 
A strong case could be made that it is more in line with Bitcoin ethos to allow end users to trust the mining collective that controls majority hashing power to provide accurate information on transaction validity, and be able to retain control BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain with private keys that they exclusively control, than to be able to trustlessly validate the blockchain, but have to trust a Trusted Third Party bitbank to honor their claim to BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain.
I think for network health, the most important quality is the scale of real world economic activity and the total fees paid, relative to the block size, rather than the absolute size of blocks. As long as the value and fee density of transaction data remains constant, I believe the network becomes only more resilient as block sizes increase. The Bitcoin core devs should reconsider the design goal of restraining the block size to allow a typical computer to run a full node, and consider a hard fork that removes the hard limit and replaces it with a mechanism to smooth out block size increases, and disincentivize low value spam/bloat txs, while allowing higher-value and fee-paying txs.
@_date: 2015-05-11 08:22:15
Agreed. It would be positive on balance. Having a &gt;99.99% assurance that a tx won't be double spent after 1 minute, rather than after 10 minutes, would be a nice little bonus in commerce. Still, with the current default behavior of clients of not relaying double spends, and with (mostly) block-time independent protocols like the Lightning Network possibly on the horizon, it's not that big of a deal either way.
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:23:14


I think the primary reason it's had fiat withdrawal issues is banks don't work with it, for regulatory reasons. Both explanations would have government involvement contributing to the fiat withdrawal problems, not the absence of it.


I haven't seen anyone of repute in the Bitcoin community suggest lack of funds is the reason. Gregory Maxwell for example, who offered his opinion on the cause of Gox's withdrawal issues, attributed it to how Gox's custom wallet handled transaction malleability, and that is what Mt Gox itself claimed shortly afterward. Other exchanges also temporarily suspended BTC withdrawals due to issues relating to tx malleability, so it doesn't look like Gox concocted the story.


I think customers should have a right to choose for themselves whether they gamble their money with a business that doesn't meet any set of standards, and businesses should have a right to choose whether they meet such standards. The existence of exchanges that have poor security standards, and people who make the wrong bet on which exchange they risk their money with, doesn't justify imposing regulatory requirements on everyone, which means taking away everyone's choice on the matter. 
I think you can't have progress without risk and failure, and the evolution of the Bitcoin economy over the last five years supports that progress happens rapidly without licensing. 
Now, if regulations are going to happen anyway, against my best wishes, I hope they are limited to BTC &lt;-&gt; fiat exchange, as they are the least damaging in my opinion, largely because the market has already largely built in expectations of these kinds of regulations being applied, and there are therefore fewer garage-room startups in this area that would be disrupted by them.

Larger blocks mean more people involved in Bitcoin and therefore more prospective full node operators. The block size limit is also a limit on the size of the Bitcoin economy and user base.


If there isn't enough space in blocks for more than a smidgeon of the world's population to make BTC transactions, then people would have no economic interest in running a full node.

The cost of setting up a pool large enough to be competitive far exceeds the additional storage/bandwidth cost of running a 20 MB or 100 MB  per block node. I don't see how the block size has any bearing on pool operators who are running large-scale operations with high overhead costs.

The people who formed Blockstream spent years contributing to Bitcoin. They didn't do it for money. They did it because they want the project to succeed. If the prospect of personal financial gain was behind their position on the block size, they would have spent the  last several years very differently, and they would not have formed a company dedicated to creating open source software. 
I mean, it's theoretically possible that these long-time contributors to Bitcoin Core have suddenly adopted a whole new set of values that places personal gain over advancing the state of technology, and chosen an extremely inefficient path to make money, which involves creating open source software, and then providing consulting services around integrating the software for enterprises, but it's unlikely.

The cost of running a Visa data center with a given capacity is going to be much much higher than the cost of running a full node at the same capacity, owing to the following:
* A Visa data center stores private data that needs to be secured from theft, which means it needs multiple layers of physical and software security, whereas a full node can contain only public data and therefore can have much lower security
* A Visa data center's redundancy needs to be contained within itself and perhaps a couple mirror centers, whereas a full node's redundancy is found in the rest of the network
And plus, the real scale of Visa is its maximum throughput capacity of 50,000+ tps, whereas when people have talked about Bitcoin matching Visa, they're really talking about matching its average throughput of 3-4,000 tps. In other words, we're talking about a full node that has about 8% of the capacity of a Visa data center.
For all these reasons, I think "Visa-level throughput levels" is totally attainable for the Bitcoin network via larger blocks.

Well then on this topic maybe we agree.
As for SPVP SCs, I believe they could only be helpful to the main chain. You're not going to siphon value from a blockchain by growing its mining and user ecosystem, and increasing the utility of its unit of account. The fact that SPVP SCs are essentially altcoins backed by BTC, means they are a new source of demand for BTC currency ("you want to use the AnonyCoinSideChain!? You need to get your hands on some BTC!"). The fact that, in practice, they would need to be merge-mined to be secure, means resources contributed to securing them would by necessity also secure the main chain.

The term "decentralised" is so nebulous as to be useless. What Satoshi meant by decentralised was evidently not what you mean, given he considered a network where only data centers can run full nodes to still be decentralised. Given the vision Satoshi communicated about how Bitcoin would operate at scale, clearly Bitcoin's social contract calls for Bitcoin blocks to be allowed to grow large enough to allow all legitimate txs to get confirmed. 
We can of course change the social contract with consensus, but we're never going to have consensus to change it to what you want, which is a network that can always be run through Tor. What we could get consensus for is to change the social contract to limit the block size so that a single high end PC and consumer grade broadband connection can always validate the blockchain, but you and other Tor-ists don't want to compromise or debate this honestly, so you will very likely obstruct hard fork discussions until there is a blockchain split.

You're misunderstanding me. I'm saying that the original consensus was for Bitcoin's layer 1 to scale with legitimate usage. Obstructing a change of the limit to turn Bitcoin into a small layer 1 protocol is 'change without consensus'.


A limit may be a bug fix, but the value of 1 MB for the limit was meant to be temporary. The original vision clearly calls for layer 1 to scale. Not allowing the 1 MB value to change is forcing a change of Bitcoin's vision without consensus.

I'll add an opposing view: as long as Bitcoin is reliant on hard forks, Bitcoin will be required to be centralized around a core group of influential parties capable of rounding up enough support to achieve broad consensus within the Bitcoin community. Hard forks require governance, and governance is centralized by nature. 
To avoid constantly having to do can-kick hard forks, sooner or later, a robust long-term solution needs to be decided upon for the block size limit. The sooner this happens, the sooner a major source of uncertainty about Bitcoin's future is eliminated, and consequently, the sooner the market can more reliably plan for Bitcoin's future.
Furthermore, hard forks could get more difficult as the Bitcoin community gets larger. Therefore, a proposal that increases the limit too slowly, but enough to help grow the Bitcoin economy, might become what Bitcoin is stuck with forever.

I'll try to explain it from a different angle: there are cases when someone will prefer on-chain over off-chain. Limits on on-chain throughput will make blockchains without such limits more competitive, which in turn will boost transaction volume on such blockchains, which will increase transaction fee revenue for its miners, and will also increase the alternate blockchain's network effect and liquidity. Simply put, fewer limits is a competitve advantage, up until it leads to a level of centralisation that compromises a blockchain's censorship resistance.

Agreed. I think the best process for determining a safe limit is to implement BIP 100 (without a hardcoded 32 MB limit) then fine tune the limit to track bandwidth growth. Setting the limit automatically through hashing power vote I imagine would be much smoother and more consistent with how Bitcoin works than setting it through softforks where &gt;50% of hashpower enforces the limit change through the threat of its cartel orphaning stragglers.

Actually, the cost of generating proof of work for Bitcoin adjusts to whatever the mining reward is, not vice versa. Furthermore, the actual cost of transaction validation, as opposed to generating proof of work, is not very high, regardless of the mining reward, so Bitcoin could theoretically scale to any number of transactions per second, with tens of thousands of miners (though increases in transaction throughput could cause the number of fully validating miners to decrease, resulting in mining centralization, but that's a different subject), and be very affordable.

Unfortunately, economic models to predict the behavior of large systems are next to useless, because they can't take into account all factors or be tested. Simulations have to make assumptions, and these very assumptions are unscientific, and are the points of contention. Macroeconomics is not a real science and macroeconomists are not real scientists.
Relying on the economic majority to steer the debate is really a way of tapping into the Wisdom of Crowds, which has been shown to be a very effective way to accurately predict the future and make good decisions. To get the input of the economic majority, the debate needs to involve the whole community, and not just protocol experts who have no special knowledge of how censorship resistant the network will be under various throughput and adoption scenarios.

A block size limit policy change isn't a technical fix. It's changing a core economic property of Bitcoin. Economic properties of Bitcoin, like the 21 million coin limit, or the block size limit policy, should be set in stone. We don't debate whether a deflationary currency supply is optimal, because we all know that that is what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin. I believe the limit policy should be the same way. 
Hard forks in the future will likely be technical fixes like replacing SHA2 if vulnerabilities are found in it, and thus will not be contentious as this is.
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:10:33
The original plan, which there was consensus around, was to remove the 1 MB limit when the average block size got close to it, and to only use the 1 MB limit as a temporary stop-gap solution to deal with the threat of a DoS attack, a threat which was far more pronounced at the time due to the immature state of Bitcoin mining, where there was a possibility for a rogue miner to create a large number of massive blocks constituting filler (e.g. dust transactions). This was when it was conceivable for a non-professional trouble maker miner to gain a massive hashrate advantage through a mining innovation (e.g. FPGA mining) and creating a significant percentage of blocks.
To make the temporary 1 MB limit into a permanent tool to throttle transaction volume is the change, and that change requires consensus (which obviously it would never get, as the community would never collectively agree to throttle the network at 1 MB every 10 minutes if the issue was proposed today, instead of being grandfathered in).

But with a BIP 100 that's not capped at 32 MB, we're not committing to increasing the limit to over 32 MB, only leaving the option open. It would still take over 80% of the hashrate to make it happen, which is actually feasible, compared to doing a hard fork when the Bitcoin economy is anywhere from 32 to 500 times bigger than it is now.
We have every reason to be concerned that a hard fork at that stage will be impossible. As explains, standards have a tendency to becoming hard to change/replace:

Post-fork BitcoinXT is one version of Bitcoin, supported by Gavin Andersen and Mike Hearn, and many long-time Bitcoiners. It's not an altcoin like Litecoin or Dogecoin.

Also, as an aside, it's one hell of a stretch to call a client that abides by the current consensus rules, and would only hard fork if 75% of the hashrate supported the hard fork for an extended period of time, an 'altcoin client'. It's a disingenuous claim to rationalize an unethical censorship policy designed to promote an unpopular agenda.

Signatures can be verified at 4,000/sec with a 2013-era quad core processor. Transaction processing is not the bottleneck, bandwidth is.
I agree about the centralization problem with miners. The only mitigating factor I see is that voting on price is a lot harder to do for the purpose of furthering one's own interests at the expense of the network's, without getting caught, than voting on something subjective like 'ideal block size limit'. 
If miners are suddenly claiming that their bandwidth is getting extremely cheap relative to BTC, even though in reality no such change is happening, just so that they can cause the block size limit to increase, people can easily verify that they're lying, because they can see that bandwidth and BTC have indeed not changed in price. 
The prospect of being punished by the greater Bitcoin market for lying could discourage a great majority of them from doing so, and a majority being honest is all that's needed for the network to have an accurate price for bandwidth in terms of BTC, if the median value of the last N blocks determines the network price.
As for charging a set amount in BTC for more block space: the problem with that is that BTC has no set value, so the cost of space will fluctuate depending on the value of BTC. Burning BTC is also probably not a good idea given the finiteness of BTC units (2.1 quadrillion Satoshis). A decline of currency units will harm granularity in the future.

It's not the "majority" that says this. It's people very familiar with mining. Obviously with increasing fixed costs, larger mining operations and pools, that can reduce the proportion of their revenues that they need to spend on fixed costs, perform better. That's just basic economics.


Obviously.. 


That's always a possibility. We just don't know.
Pooled mining has advantages over large non-pooling mining operations, like the ability to use free electricity, and electricity used to generate heat. Free electricity is widely distributed, and can only be fully utilized with a large number of small mining operations. Heat generated by electricity meanwhile is very distributed, as the need for it is found in a low concentration among a very large number of households.

The quote you're referring to, which you're making a host of assumptions about, was in late 2008. The one I provided was in late 2010, long after Bitcoin had proven that the concept works. He repeatedly talked about how Bitcoin would scale to allow thousands of transactions to be processed per second, and talked about how at scale, the network would consolidate into a smaller number of larger nodes, run by professionals.
No matter how much you try, you cannot rewrite the history of Bitcoin. It's this refusal to admit the original vision for Bitcoin that has led to the community being divided. If you want to advance your agenda, do it in an honest manner, where you acknowledge Bitcoin's history and original vision, which tens of thousands of people signed up for.


Who said anything about "corporations usurping control of the network's backbone"?

You're not understanding benefits of scale. The proportion of revenues spent on fixed costs decreases as revenues increase, so larger mining operations and pools have an advantage over smaller ones.

Even Satoshi doesn't have the moral right to changing the original vision set out for Bitcoin without obtaining wide consensus.


Because people are rewriting history to advance an agenda for what they think Bitcoin should become. This started with Peter Todd back in early 2013, claiming that Bitcoin should evolve to where transaction fees are $20:
Even I disagree with Satoshi's original vision, and think we should be more conservative, as the majority of Core developers seem to prefer, but I think it's important for the sake of community consensus that we are honest about what the original vision was, and go about changing the vision through the proper process, which is to garner consensus for it. Pushing our own vision onto Bitcoin by obstructing hard fork discussions, and holding a higher limit hostage to everyone else agreeing to our more restrictive limit policy, is not the right way to go about it.

An idea that I had before is to have miners input two values into their client: cost of 1 GB bandwidth in their local currency and cost of 1 BTC in their local currency. Their client would then calculate a cost of 1 GB of bandwidth in BTC, and encode the value in the block header they're hashing on. The median BTC/GB value of the last N blocks would be considered the global cost of bandwidth in BTC, and be used to determine the blocksize limit (lower cost means higher limit, and vice versa).
This would allow the limit to increase in two ways: decreases in the cost of bandwidth, and increases in the value of BTC. It's probably easily gameable, but possibly less so if the voting is done through transactions (weighted by Bitcoin Days Destroyed) rather than block headers.

Well-capitalized, professionally run companies like Coinbase would have appeared much sooner had there been no financial regulations in the US, as it was regulatory uncertainty that kept VC money away as long as it did. 
Furthermore, none of the currently existing financial or tech regulations, Bitlicense included, would have prevented the MtGox meltdown, which was a result of stolen/lost BTC, other than by simply preventing from MtGox from ever existing, which would have eliminated Bitcoin's sole source of liquidity in its early history, and meant Bitcoin would have had no way to graduate from a fringe curiosity to a reputable enough economy for major companies to enter.
For someone interested in decentralized currency, you sure do have a lot of faith in the most centralized, coercion-based type of social organization in the world.

It takes over 80% of the hash power voting over a particular value for the limit to be increased to that value with BIP 100. That means that miners voting for a higher limit could stand to gain a competitive advantage over, at most, only 20% of the hashrate. This comes at the price of 1) fee pressure and 2) market confidence in the network. 
Regarding the latter, if we take it as a given that Bitcoin's sole value proposition over centralised payment systems is its censorship-resistance, then it stands to reason that harming that quality by encouraging centralisation will hurt the market price of bitcoin, and by extension, miner revenues. I think it would be highly unlikely for over 80% of the hash rate to go against both developer consensus and the long term interest of the network, to vote for a too-high limit, just to gain a slight advantage, in the short term, over, at most, 20% of the hashrate.

Yes, that is also a problem. My [suggestion]( was to add a steadily increasing lower and upper bound to the limit, and allow miners to specify the exact value within the band. For the lower bound specifically, I proposed it increase by 10% a year for the 30 years, and then 0% per year thereafter.

900 MB per block is 1.5 MB/s. A node has to upload/download transactions more than once, so to be conservative, we can use a figure of 20 MB/s for the bandwidth requirement of running a full node in a network with that transaction throughput. If Bitcoin were supported by an economy doing 2,500 transactions per second (approximately equivalent to an economy the size of Canada's), I'm fairly confident there would be a sufficient number parties able and willing to run a full node with those resource requirements.

And it turns out the fiat withdrawals problems, which was the major issue that everyone was worried about at the time, were not due to lack of liquidity.
The BTC withdrawal problems came much later, and had nothing to do with this episode, which was related to the seizure of $5 million USD from MtGox's US bank account by the US government, and the  concerns at the time that MtGox didn't have enough fiat in their accounts to honor fiat withdrawals.

The LN is a significantly more complex and ambitious application of payment channels than Streamium, making it very very experimental.

Who said anything about "Bitcoin 2.0"? I'm talking about regular old transactions. If fees go to $20, Bitcoin not only loses its competitiveness against cheaper blockchains, users lose their ability to easily change hubs in a hypothetical Lightning Network, leading to a LN that has poor adaptability, and a much higher likelihood of becoming centralized in a small number of large, regulated hubs, that make Satoshi's server farms look like a decentralized dream in comparison.

10% a year would most likely be well below broadband growth rates, considering the historical trend. Having this as the minimum annual growth rate mitigates the potential opportunity cost from miners picking too low a limit. Given it only takes 20% of the hashrate to prevent a block size limit increase, or cause a decrease, miners picking a too-limit is a real possibility.

I think the risk of hard coding a limit that turns out to be too low or too high, and us not being able to change it, due to inertia, is greater than the risk that a supermajority of miners will act against the network's interests in the limit they pick, so I do prefer a BIP 100 style miner controlled limit.


A soft fork limit is therefore the most consistent with the principle of consensus. If the community had to choose, and all options were equally attainable, they would choose a soft fork limit. The only reason we're stuck with a hard limit now is that it's so hard to change a network wide consensus rule that is in place.

Yep, if they coordinate to generate five years worth of fraudulent proof of work. I find that extremely unlikely. 


Yes, until performance reaches its physical limits, which at some point it must. After that point, any block size limit above 0 will lead to the network becoming increasingly centralized.
Instead of crippling adoption of Bitcoin with a permanent 1 MB limit, which introduces a host of other risks, like obsolescence, and weak protection from political attack owing to low public buy-in, and still doesn't fundamentally solve the problem of a perpetually growing IBD, it's better to take the risk that the mining majority will coordinate to generate five years worth of PoW to defraud you, and cap the size of the IBD by limiting validation to txs generated after a point some constant length of time in the past relative to the present.

Other protocols are either impossible to change, or can only be changed through a difficult manual process of the entire userbase actively upgrading more or less simultaneously, which usually requires a central authority mandating a change over over a specific period (e.g. a government changing the official currency).
BIP 100 enables Bitcoin to change the protocol through a p2p process that triggers all clients to automatically upgrade to a new block size limit without the userbase having to coordinate a mass software update. It's a major step over the prevailing way in which protocols work.

Only by paying a Bitcoin transaction fee. To make $5,000 worth of BTC available on the LN for spending, you need to create a Bitcoin transaction that locks the BTC in a channel between you and a LN hub. 
And back to people earning less $2 a day. A $20 transaction fee to create a single channel with a LN hub, means those 2.8 billion people will never be able to use the LN. They will not be locking "$5,000 worth of BTC" in a LN channel. They make $60 a month. A $20 transaction fee prices them out.
You're simply wrong about how the LN works, and, based on your misconceptions, advocating the dangerous notion that Bitcoiners embrace a block size limit that leads to $20 transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:06:27
I think it's very unlikely there will be a need to decrease the block size limit, but say for example careless parties attain 81% of the hashrate for a short period and increase the limit at a faster rate than bandwidth growth and demand, and the result is centralization of the network as very blocks fill with non-fee-paying spam txs are consistently generated. When the 'responsible' miners regain 21% of the hashrate, they could then return the limit to an optimal value that limits spam and enables an adequate level of decentralization.
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:58:08
I agree. What the ratio between the limit and broadband availability should be is a major point of debate. Gavin's proposal says 8 MB to today's level of broadband deployment. I personally think it should depend on both need and metrics of network health, like full node decentralisation, which is why I think a BIP 100 style limit adjustment mechanism, where a super-majority of the hashrate can increase or decrease the limit, is the best way to handle it.
@_date: 2015-08-22 05:21:01
Bitcoin would be technically unique from centralized payment systems even if the cost of running a full node equaled the cost of running a Visa data center. Its differentiating quality is its formal and universally accessible mechanism for authorizing timestamps, in the reliance on cumulative proof of work. In practice, to maintain effective decentralization and censorship resistance, it would probably be safe to keep the cost to operate a full node below the cost to operate a Visa data center :)

"Nothing to lose" is a figure of speech, meaning 'what we have to lose is much less consequential than what we have to gain'. To be precise, we do have 'something' to lose - the chance of having a censorship resistant high powered money for large value transfers - but I think, relative to what we could gain from large blocks - a censorship resistant payment network that is affordable enough to replace all centralized payment systems, and not just SWIFT - that's negligible. 
To elaborate as to why: I think $20 transaction fees will very likely lead to a highly ossified Lightning Network where the high cost of switching hubs leads to most users connecting only to a small number of very large and reputable hubs, and that these hubs will end up coming under regulations. 
I do not think transaction fees will ever get to $20 with a highly restrictive block size limit mind you. I think a network that has a limit that is not at all flexible to increased demand will be outcompeted by a network that does.

Not everyone is in favor of increasing the block size limit enough to accommodate moving value to and from LN hubs **affordably**.


We have no idea if the LN will work as promised. It is a very very experimental technology, that needs major development done on multiple areas to even have a chance of working. The confidence you have in it is foolhardy.
Voting pools are just centralized payment processors with federated security. They're a small notch about PayPal for censorship resistance.
More importantly, a restrictive block size limit will mean that transaction fees will skyrocket, which will make the off-chain and LN ecosystem highly ossified, due to high switching costs.
Consumer options will be restricted as a result of the high cost of forming micropayment channels to hubs. Closing a channel with a censoring hub will now have to be weighed against the economic cost of $20 in transaction fees to do so. Forming a channel with a small amount of value locked up with a hub will no longer be economical when transaction fees are $20. Having multiple direct peers to avoid any one getting a substantial view of your personal financial history will become a luxury for the rich, because only they do enough transaction volume, and have enough wealth, to pay the the transaction fees for maintaining all of those channels.


Money is NOT "pure network effect". If Bitcoin's transaction fees increased to $100, it would quickly be replaced. That proves its competitiveness is not dependent "purely" on network effect. You're being very foolhardy with Bitcoin's market position.

By making personal accusations, your intention is to deflect from the issue at hand, which is that a plan that relies on $20 transaction fees is not viable.


If only specialists run Bitcoin full nodes, it doesn't follow that those specialists will be able to control the Bitcoin network for their own benefit. That's like claiming that since only a few companies produce ASICs, they control Bitcoin mining and therefore Bitcoin is centralized and controlled by these four companies. In reality, the fact that Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing and full node operation will always be open to new entrants, and are competitive industries, means participants will likely always be kept in check.
That is obviously what Satoshi believed too, since he specifically said specialists running large server farms would operate the full nodes at scale, and he obviously intended for Bitcoin to not be 'controlled' by any centralized party that could subvert the network's rules and subject it to censorship.

Naturally, Bitcoin's network effect could be so great that the vast majority of people would prefer to use Bitcoin off-chain over altcoin on-chain. However, there will always be edge cases where on-altchain is preferable to the user to off-blockchain.

As I said:
Who said anything about "corporations usurping control of the network's backbone"? You're making an assumption that the network will become centralized as a result of the full node operation becoming more specialized and expensive, and this is an assumption that many people, and apparently Satoshi when he was around, disagree with.
You can repeat your astroturfy comments, that are motivated by an unstated conflict of interest, as much as you want, but it will not divert this discussion from the facts.
The fact is that a Bitcoin with transaction fees of $20 is not viable. It's a foolhardy plan to rely on Bitcoin remaining competitive at these prices. It's foolhardy to rest all of Bitcoin financial accessibility on centralized 'voting pools' and as of yet uninvented and extremely ambitious Lightning Network, especially one where you need to pay a $20 transaction fee to open/close a channel with a hub.

We don't need to decrease it. We just need to prevent it from increasing, using a soft fork. Then we wait for technology to catch up.
I believe it will be much easier to soft fork a limit in, if we see the block size is growing too fast, then do another hard fork to raise the hard limit, if we see it's too low 10 years down the line. 


Absolutely false. You cannot do trillions of txs a day with the limit schedule proposed in BIP 101. With additional payment layers, you can. You can't have instant confirmation and near-zero fees with on-chain txs with BIP 101. With overlay protocols, you can. For these reasons, there will be tremendous incentive to develop these overlayers regardless of whether BIP 101 is adopted or not. 
There may be compelling arguments not to adopt BIP 101, but "there will be very little incentive" to build overlay protocols is not one of them.

Bitcoin is meant to be a peer to peer electronic cash system, not a peer to peer bullion reserve. Given that Bitcoin, unlike gold, can be cloned, it will lose everything that makes it unique, if it loses its network effect and liquidity, which is highly dependent on its use as a transactional currency, which in turn is dependent on ease of moving it.


People prefer cheap over expensive. You're advocating making Bitcoin less desirable to users and less competitive to competitors.

Investors will not make money if Bitcoin loses its decentralization, censorship-resistance and trustlessness, and investors know this. Bitcoin's sole value proposition is its permissionlessness. So if investors are pushing for a course of action, consider that perhaps they have determined that Bitcoin's utility as a permissionless ledger would be helped by that course.


He doesn't need to deny it. The blockchain is public data. It's trivial for someone to get a reliable account of the blockchain, even if they don't host it on their own machine.

Do you realize how ridiculously paranoid such a belief is?
Sacrificing massive amounts of economic scale, and forcing millions to access the blockchain through third party financial intermediaries, and untested technologies like the LN, in order to maintain this maximalist position on anonymity, is a terrible terrible trade-off that demonstrates a total lack of consideration for the accumulated risk.

Sipa's proposal, as is, will not get consensus. 8 MB would also not break Electrum server. And it's highly unlikely blocks would grow to 8 MB any time soon anyway. Regardless, would you prefer making running an Electrum resource-intensive, or leaving it economical to run one on a fork of Bitcoin, with the blockchain fragmented into two independent cryptocurrencies?

How do you imagine the "settlement layer" (the Bitcoin mining network) turning against their interests?
@_date: 2015-08-02 07:58:12
I'm glad it resonated with you. 


I think if the limit is developer-set (e.g. BIP 101 or 103), there should be a one-time initial increase in the limit, after which the limit increases according to bandwidth growth. The major Chinese pools have already agreed to 8 MB, and they're the limiting factor as far as bandwidth, so I think that makes sense as a starting point. If the limit is hashpower set (e.g. BIP 100, but hopefully a variation that doesn't have the explicit 32 MB limit hardcoded in the protocol), then I think the miners can raise the limit when the need arises, and we don't need developers handpicking it from the outset.
@_date: 2015-08-02 06:30:42
The only point I don't wholly agree with is this:


I do think the 'tyrannical' [comment]( from Satoshi does show he perhaps did not view the 'social contract' (the original specs/plan) as being as important as some of the big blockists do.
However, the counter to that is:
* Satoshi has no special authority to revoke the social contract or demote its importance after the fact. If he wants to change Bitcoin's total coin supply to exceed 21 million BTC, or change Bitcoin's purpose from payment network to an expensive to write-to settlement network, he still needs consensus from the rest of the community. 
* Satoshi made many more statements in favor of large blocks than against them. Even as late as 29/07/2010, he [wrote]( "The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate." This was more than six months after the "tyrannical" comment. So even if we give a lot of weight to his post-announcement statements on the block size and Bitcoin's purpose, his statements, on the whole, support the large-blockist view.
All this being said, it would probably be wise to heed the warnings of the majority of core contributors, and be cautious about the block size limit and full node resource requirements. Fortunately, we can do so without compromising the original vision for Bitcoin: simply increasing the limit at the same rate that bandwidth grows will eventually get Bitcoin to payment-network scale, without creating the risk of junk filling the blockchain and causing the cost of running a full node to become exorbitant. 
There are couple ways to do this: have a fixed limit growth rate, and soft fork down if it exceeds bandwidth growth, or use a BIP 100-style voting mechanism, to fine tune the limit at the protocol level to match bandwidth growth. I think the latter is the best option, but more important than which specific proposal is adopted, is the development community, including Hearn, Maxwell, and all of the other developers with strong opinions on the issue, agreeing on the principle that will guide scaling decisions.
@_date: 2015-08-23 06:44:07
Right, but you still need to create that Bitcoin transaction, and lock up some BTC, at the outset, to begin being able to use the Lightning Network. That means that if transaction fees rise to $20, as Anonobread argues we should allow to happen, most of the world will be priced out of using the Lightning Network. A start up fee (and tri-monthly renewal fee) of $20 is far too much for most of the world's population for access to a payment system.

I agree. I think there would likely be a phase when the risk faced by Bitcoin increases, as it becomes popular enough to get governments' attention, but not popular enough to be secure from attack. 
However, I think this will be a short-lived phase. Once Bitcoin gains some momentum, it will grow at a rapid exponential rate, and in short order become part of the market fabric.
The key is making Bitcoin scalable so that it doesn't have its adoption stifled by the block size limit. I think the fact that adoption has slowed at this phase (and I believe the ultimate cause to be the 1 MB limit and lack of a consensus on a plan to replace it that will allow Bitcoin to scale) is dangerous. It's popular enough now to get some political attention.


Most people care when something they use on a regular basis suddenly becomes restricted. This is why the use of cash is almost totally unrestricted despite most of the population being politically apathetic.


The internet had a similar impact but it grew too quickly for most governments, particularly liberal democracies, to ban it in its unrestricted form.
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:01:20
I believe your analysis is wrong, for the following reasons:
While it's clear Satoshi's intention for putting in place the 1 MB limit was an anti-DOS measure, it's also clear that his definition DOS was different than how you're using it now.
His very first descriptions of Bitcoin's purpose include explanations of how Bitcoin could process over 3,000 txs per second, with 2008 era bandwidth. Obviously legitimate txs that represent real world transfers of value were not considered the type of txs that a DOS attack would consist of.
When Satoshi put the limit in place, it was at a time when there was a possibility for a rogue miner to create a large number of massive blocks constituting filler (e.g. dust transactions). This was when it was conceivable for a non-professional trouble maker miner to gain a massive hashrate advantage through a mining innovation (e.g. FPGA mining) and creating a significant percentage of blocks.
Mining is now too competitive and professional for something similar to happen. Now, all that would be needed is a simple limit as multiple of median size of last N blocks to prevent the kind of really damaging blockchain bloat attacks that were possible in Bitcoin's early history, because it would be enough to prevent a malicious miner with a tiny share of the hashrate from doing something like creating a 1 GB block.
This is not to say that there are no merits to having a hard limit. Just that the original purpose of the temporary DOS-protection limit can no longer be used to justify the limit being in place, and we need a new consensus if we want to use a limit to artificially throttle legitimate transaction volume to protect full node decentralization.
@_date: 2015-08-22 04:47:04


Exactly, you can clone the technical functionality, but not the ecosystem and network effect, which is why I wrote:


I've stated this a couple of times now. Not sure why you're still having trouble grasping my point.


Some users will prefer on-chain transactions to off-chain transactions in some cases. In such cases, higher transaction fees for on-chain transactions makes Bitcoin less competitive against cheaper competing blockchains.


I never said anything bout Bitcoin 2.0. I made that clear last time you brought it up, yet you continue to straw man my argument. I'm saying that regular-old vanilla transactions need to be affordable for Bitcoin to be competitive and useful. If they get expensive, even Sidechains and the LN become less usable. You need to move BTC on-chain to move them between different SCs, or between different LN hubs. The more expensive that is, the less liquid and versatile the Bitcoin ecosystem becomes, which makes it 1) more prone to centralization and 2) less competitive.
Furthermore, there is no telling when SCs and the LN will become functional, or whether they will be able to substitute for on-chain transactions for all applications. Therefore, even if these currently non-existent solutions don't end up being adversely affected by high on-chain transaction fees (and they probably will be), we can't count on them as a replacement for affordable on-chain transactions, since there's no guarantee what their functionality will be, and when it will be available.


It's either another blockchain, which will pose a mortal competitive threat to Bitcoin, or it will be centralized. There are no known technologies for decentralized electronic transfers of value other than the PoW blockchain. The market will have the best option for moving BTC in a decentralized manner eliminated for it through high fees. That is what you're advocating.

Until it's been developed and tried in the real world, there's no way to know what limitations LN transfers will have.

8 GB blocks allows one-third of global transactions to happen on the Bitcoin blockchain. Given credit cards, physical cash and other non-Bitcoin payment systems aren't going to disappear, this is likely enough for anyone who wants to put their coffee purchase on the blockchain to do so.
More importantly, 8 GB blocks will allow a highly fluid/versatile Lightning Network. Low tx fees means being able to create micropayment channels with any number of hubs, and quickly close and open them to change hubs, whenever one feels inclined, without concern for the transaction fees involves. This means less lock-in (making for a more competitive market for hubs) and more privacy (splitting your transactions across a greater number of direct peers means any one of them has less information about your personal financial history).
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:04:06


I strongly recommend reading [this post]( It details all of the problems with 'one off' block size increases.
To add to the above: raising the limit through frequent hard forks necessitates that Bitcoin centralize its decision making process into the hands of a small number of influential developers, who are capable of shepherding the dev community to consensus. It's dangerous for Bitcoin, and it's exactly the kind of political administration that Bitcoin was designed to eliminate.
What's good about BIP 100 (minus the explicit 32 MB, that I believe Blockstream misguidedly insisted on), is that it allows the community to fine tune the limit, rather than being locked into a permanent automatic increase schedule, to fit the circumstances (the state of technology, network health, market demand), but without the very centralizing and dangerous aspects of a hard fork. Whoever gets 90% of the hashpower behind them, decides the block size. If we can't muster 10% of the hashing power to veto a bad decision, Bitcoin is beyond help anyway, so this seems likely a very consensus driven way to make changes.
If we want to avoid the blockchain splitting apart, we need to compromise. Pieter and Gavin have already shown a willingness to compromise, with their respective proposals. It's time to take that further, and come to a solution that everyone can agree to. Everyone can't agree to Satoshi's original vision of data centers running full nodes, and they can't agree to your proposal of a hard fork every couple years. So let's find a solution that we can all agree on.
@_date: 2015-08-13 01:33:22
I did not know there were concerns that the infrastructure might not be ready for 8 MB blocks. In that case, the solution you mention, of having an initial, faster growth phase, up until 8 MB, makes sense. Either way, modifying the proposal, to get the limit to 8 MB soon, will make it viable in terms of gaining consensus IMHO.


Many stakeholders in the Bitcoin community see a 1 MB base block size as unsatisfactory. That is why I suggested that perhaps we could mitigate the risks associated with an initial increase of the hard limit to 8 MB through methods other than a block size limit, like fundraising for open source pooled mining software that encourages validation. For example, we could make your proposal being adopted contingent on a Lighthouse fundraiser for such software development getting $1 million worth of BTC committed to it. I'm just brainstorming - I'm not sure how appropriate this specific proposal is, but you get the idea. By finding alternative methods for reducing the risks posed by larger blocks, we can get a wider consensus, since a large portion of the Bitcoin community wants a higher block size limit.


Your proposal might be less controversial for the small-block crowd, but it is very controversial for the large blockists. I believe the least controversial proposal, when all constituents are factored in, is a modified version of your proposal, that provides more leeway for larger blocks, like the example I gave.


Let's say we do increase the base block size limit to 8 MB. That's an 8X increase in layer 1's maximum transaction throughput. That's the difference between the network being able to serve the population of the United States, and the population of California. To provide a more relevant example, it's the difference between Bitcoin having 2,000,000 users and a per unit price of $265, or 250,000 users and a per unit price of $33. The indirect benefits of an economy 8 times larger includes more funding available for other scaling solutions. Take Blockstream for example. It received $21 million in funding largely due to the adoption Bitcoin achieved in the last 4 years. An 800% growth in the size of the Bitcoin economy could see a similar emergence of new funding sources.
In other words, increasing layer 1's maximum transaction throughput is not mutually exclusive with layer 2 and above scaling solutions, and in fact could boost development of the latter. And ultimately, the scale of activity that can be done on layer 2 and above is limited by the capacity of layer 1. Extending layer 1's maximum transaction throughput as much as possible is therefore only beneficial.
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:27:24
Consensus has shifted to what? When did the community express consensus for turning the block size limit into a tool to limit the volume of legitimate transactions? 


I've provided evidence for the original vision for Bitcoin, which people signed up for, being large blocks and no artificial limits on the block size for the purpose of ensuring every consumer can validate the blockchain. 
Of course, you're a troll who has in the past said he'd be okay if only banks can use the blockchain, and has insulted the Bitcoin community for taking a favourable view of tax avoidance, so no surprise you're being dishonest.
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:12:59


Let me speak in your language: there was no consensus to change the original plan of Bitcoin being a peer-to-peer electronic cash that the whole world can use, into one where the network would be crippled with a 1.67 KB/s throughput limit, for central banking lackeys who want to ensure peer-to-peer electronic currency, and all of the pesky problems it creates for their socialist ideology, like tax avoidance, never takes off.
There was never consensus to change the original plan for a scaled up Bitcoin from one where anyone can generate a transaction and have it immutably confirmed in a block, to one where we fool ourselves into thinking the average person will pay $20 transaction fees for a SWIFT replacement, instead of using any number of cheaper blockchains, just because of the theoretical advantages of greater decentralization, and rest all of our hopes on highly ambitious, ultra-experimental concepts like the Lightning Network, and the dream that they are ready for consumer use sometime in the next decade AND work every bit as well as we hope.


Then you didn't read anything that its creator wrote about it from late 2008 through to 2010, or anything in the Bitcoin Wiki about how Bitcoin would easily scale to match Visa's throughput. Just because you were asleep, and unaware of what you were getting into, doesn't mean others were.

The tx fees are going to the same miners when there's merge-mining, meaning the tx fees would be acting to secure the MC. The MC will always be more useful than its SCs, because:
1. all txs on the MC are fully validated, so the only type of fraudulent tx that can occur is a double spend, making value stored on it more secure
2. all SC miners merge mine the MC, but not vice versa, giving the MC a higher hashrate, and making value stored on it more secure
3. the MC is the only chain that has a direct conduit for transferring value with all the other chains in the SC ecosystem, making the MC a natural hub
It's theoretically possible that those with a financial interest in the success of SCs, say for example Blockstream, act to hobble the MC's transaction throughput, in order to drive activity into SCs, but I think this is quite unlikely, and the many benefits that building an ecosystem of dependent SCs provides the MC far outweighs this theoretical risk.

How likely is it that miners are going to generate five years worth of fraudulent proof of work to make you believe that a fraudulent UTXO is valid? I think if the mining majority was willing to go to those lengths to corrupt Bitcoin, the network would be a lost cause regardless of whether this particular attack was possible. It's almost certainly against the mining majority's interest to act in such a hypothetically corrupt manner, given it would massively degrade trust in the network and the value of coins they earn through block rewards.

Good response by Pieter, though I still mostly agree with Gavin on the trade-offs.


The fallback option of fully validated mining will always exist, and will very likely be used if any attempt is made by a mining cartel a government to restrict what miners can do.
Using trust to increase efficiency is going to happen in the Bitcoin consensus economy as it grows. Pooled mining itself is a type of trust-based efficiency optimization. Of course it would be nice if all miners were solo-miners, but if pooled mining was the price that had to be paid for Bitcoin to go from $0.50/unit and 2,000 users, to $300/unit and 2,000,000 users, I think it was a price worth paying.

These are obvious facts about it, and not comments on the finer details of the protocol. And I make these comments in the context of people arguing that we can forestall a block size limit increase or even not do one, because we can rely on LN to make Bitcoin massively scalable.


I understand the basics of it.. I understand that you need money locked in a channel with a LN hub to use that hub as a routing node. That you need an on-chain transaction to close one of these channels, and another one to create a channel with a new hub. From these facts, I can induce what high fees will do to a hypothetical LN.

His analysis is over-simplified, in cleanly dividing payment and settlement functionality, when in reality, there is significant overlap, and also in not acknowledging the boost that the network being utilized for payments gives to its function as a settlement network (e.g. more transaction fees paid on payment txs = increases in network hashrate = more security and trust in the settlement network).

Satoshi said that Bitcoin would scale by the network consolidating into a smaller number of server farm nodes run by specialists. That doesn't require a slow rate of scaling, that tracks bandwidth growth, or one that ensures full node decentralization.
The original vision promoted by Satoshi contradicts the vision being promoted now by those resisting changing the block size limit.
The proper way to change that vision is to be honest that what's being sought is a change in Bitcoin's vision, and seek to obtain consensus for that change, rather than force a change through obstruction and the re-writing of history. The latter track leads to the community becoming divided.

My point is that you don't need to validate yourself to have an influence on block generation. You only need to be able to produce proof of work, and anyone can do that, with even a tiny hashrate. Pooling neutralizes the need to run a full node and influence block generation.

Your analysis assumes that storage will cost the same amount in 2024 as it does now. 
Also, the flip side of 128 megabyte blocks is that that the economy will also be a couple of orders of magnitude larger than it is now meaning there will be many many more people interested in running a full node, which should counter the depressant effect of higher full load costs on the number of full nodes in operation.

AFAIK, BIP 100 explicitly sets 32 MB as the limit, rather than simply failing to fix the network message size limit. What this means is that even if the network message limit was fixed or bypassed by Bitcoin adopting an alternative p2p network protocol, we would be faced with a new hard limit.

Hello again Anonobread, 


Your comments are idiotic. Most of the world makes $2 a day. $20 transaction fees means you need to transact over $1,000 at a time to make it economic, which means most of the world will never use Sidechains or the Lightning Network. Obviously the market isn't that irrational, and what will happen instead is that blockchains offering plentiful space will be used by the world, and not one built under the assumption that users are not dissuaded by artificial scarcity.
Just as myopic thinkers thought computers would never have more than 6 KB of RAM, you think there will never be enough block space for the entire world to use directly every day. There will. Just watch.


Oh yeah, a guy making $2 a day will pay $20 to transact $1,000 he doesn't have. Great thinking.


The cheaper solution will be another blockchain, and that will result in that blockchain gaining the network and liquidity.

Bandwidth is by far the largest cost and impediment in running a full node, and will be more so once pruned validation is fully deployed. If you mean that a node has to upload/download transactions more than once, you're right, but it still doesn't make the resource requirements so demanding that it would lead to extreme centralization. An economy the size of Canada's could support plenty of full nodes using 20 MB/s of bandwidth for example.

**can** is not the word you use for "possibility". It's used here in the context of ability, like I "can" (am able) to do this. He's explaining the process available to effect the change. It's clear from the larger context, where Satoshi repeatedly discussed Bitcoin handling thousands of txs per second for the world, that the 1 MB limit was a temporary anti-DoS solution, and not meant to throttle the volume of legitimate transactions.


You quoted people warning about what could happen, not Satoshi agreeing with those predictions. 
Let's once again, look at what he wrote about what Bitcoin was supposed to become:


-Satoshi Nakamoto
None of this, "let's use a 1 MB limit to ensure every person in the world can validate the blockchain, even if that means transaction fees go to $20, and only 1 in 10,000 people gets to get their transaction into the blockchain every day".

I'd argue the first and the second would be the same regardless of whether the block size was 0.5 MB or 5 MB.

That's not what headers-first means though. It just means downloading headers before download *and validating* all of the transactions corresponding to those headers. Headers first synchronization currently involves full validation of the blockchain.


My argument is that there doesn't have to be as much confidence as full validation. At some point the confidence of a UTXO commit is so great that the marginal increases in confidence from doing full validation cease to be worth the additional cost in synchronization time/cost.

China has already banned Tor. Governments have shown a greater willngness to ban Tor than to ban Bitcoin. If anything, boosting adoption, with a less restrictive block size limit policy, will let more people hide Bitcoin activity that may run afoul the laws of the censoring country, by having a larger crowd of Bitcoin users to hide amongst. Those living in countries where Bitcoin is totally banned can simply use a VPN service to connect to a full node they run outside the country. If both VPNs and Tor are banned, then there's no hope of accessing the Bitcoin network undetected anyway.
If you're really concerned about government censorship of Bitcoin, you should want to boost adoption more than anything. Adoption is what makes technology bans costly. The widespread use of VPNs in China for example is the reason the government there doesn't ban it outright.

Insulting me isn't going to change the facts. The public plan was to discuss how to raise it, but it was always the plan to raise it before it affected legitimate (non-DoS attack) transactions, and never the plan to use the limit as a tool to impose an economic policy of throttling legitimate transaction volume.
His very first descriptions of Bitcoin's purpose include explanations of how Bitcoin could process over 3,000 txs per second, with 2008 era bandwidth. Obviously the 1 MB limit was never intended to prevent legitimate tx volume from exceeding 1 MB every 10 minutes, and was only meant as a temporary anti-DoS tool.
Satoshi very clearly indicated that the limit would be raised before it began throttling legitimate transaction volume:


    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
      maxblocksize = largerlimit




Obstructing debate on finding a replacement for the 1 MB limit, in order to convert it from a temporary anti-DoS measure, to a tool to throttle legitimate transaction volume, is going against the original plan, and is doing so without community consensus.

Tx fees won't be diverted off the main chain. The txs currently taking place in internal databases would now be taking place in internal blockchains.

I agree it introduces a theoretical new risk. I'm arguing it's a risk worth taking to avoid centralization through increasing IBD costs.


You're going to trust the longest chain, so if you only trust a commitment five years or more in the past, that means they have to create that fraudulent commitment, then generate five years worth of PoW on top of it to get you trust it. Theoretically it's possible that they do this in a much shorter period of time than 5 years, by acquiring an amount of hashpower that dwarfs the combined hashrate of the entire network, and then fixing the timestamps to manipulate the difficulty adjustment so that blocks are generated in much shorter intervals, but then we're talking about a theatre of the absurd scenario.

What you mention is possible, but IMO, unlikely, and less likely than the opposite: an innovation being thoroughly tested in a SC, and therefore making it more possible to implement it in the MC.
I think that even if the innovation is not backported, it is very unlikely that a scBTC's value will diverge from BTC, due to the 2WP functionality.
So the way I see it, two unlikely events need to both happen for SCs to be harmful to the MC.


In that event, do you think it's good or bad if the respective SCs also have a way to back their tokens with BTC? I see it as only a potential positive, with no drawbacks.
Actually, I can think of a theoretical drawback: the ability to use BTC-backed coins could give a SC its legs: by giving it a stable and liquid medium of exchange when it's starting out. After it has matured, it could begin to use direct interop relationships with other chains to bypass the MC, and eventually eclipse it. So yes, you are alluding to possible theoretical risks. But I see them as very very unlikely, and much less likely than the risks that SCs mitigate, like the MC's obsolescence in the face of innovative altcoins with their own independent (competing) money supplies.

The original vision requires consensus to change. Not allowing a code change, in order to prevent the removal of a temporary anti-spam control, is in effect, a change of Bitcoin's vision, without consensus.


Pooled mining distribution was more cenrralized a year ago. Full node count has stayed relatively steady despite the price dropping substantially.

And on top of that, Maxwell is not opposed to increasing the block size limit. He just has more stringent standards on how accessible full node validation should be. However, his claim that when Satoshi was around, it was understood that the limit should be low enough to allow "small devices" to fully validate, is not only unsubstantiated, it is directly contradicted by what is stated in the mailing list where BItcoin was announced, and posts made by the lead developer in years following.

Demand for bitcoin as an investment is based on speculation that transaction volume will increase and give the network a reliable source of non-speculative demand. It is not, like precious metals, uniquely scarce. Clones can be created, and the only advantage Bitcoin has over them, is its network effect, which is largely reliant on use for transactions. The network effect growing is what investors in Bitcoin are counting on. A major limiter on transaction throughput, without a guarantee that it will be removed, is going to cap price gains.

That was a bubble, based on hype. Any future ATHs will need to be based on a realistic possibility of usage increasing exponentially.

Moving the goal posts. My previous point, which you claimed I had "no clue" about, was about what miner behavior is now. The default settings in the reference client will obviously affect the frequency of a particular behavior. You'd like to increase the frequency of a behavior that makes it harder for people to use a popular option that they are voluntarily choosing, because..?


Of course but that's not the point. The point is FSS RBF can be made default with no significant additional cost, thus retaining whatever extra protection default FSS provides, while also allowing RBF to create a fee market.


It's not either or. Both 0-conf and &gt;=1-conf are currently used. Eliminating one option because of some weird obsessive desire to fuck with the "bagholders" any time you can, and then making up some lie about doing it because you want Bitcoin to be anti-fragile, is just you being a troll.

Bitcoin didn't come from "nothing", but it did come from zero value. Value was generated when Bitcoin was invented, and continued to increase as the Bitcoin userbase and economy grew.

You can't clone gold. You can clone the Bitcoin. The only thing that differentiates it from clones is its liquidity and network effect, which is largely dependent on its utility as a transactional currency and payment network.


You're promoting the dangerous idea that an extremely restricted Bitcoin, and thus one that is expensive to transact on, has nothing to fear from existing and future blockchains that are much cheaper. You're characterizing sensible warning about your foolhardiness as "crying wolf".


LN is not a "user". A LN hub operator and end-user are the users. For an LN end-user, paying $0.05 in transaction fees to create a new channel with a hub is more desireable than paying $20 in transaction fees. What is it about this that you are having trouble understanding, or that you claim is so fantastical? 
Are you going to promote more foolhardiness to the Bitcoin community, by claiming there's nothing to be concerned about?

Updates of thousands of transactions per second to the global state can be propagated in a fully redundant decentralized network in real time. Neither bandwidth, storage, nor CPU costs are so high that the network couldn't handle 3,000 tps in a Bitcoin economy commensurate with that throughput. A hard protocol limit of 3 tps is ridiculous and harmful. 
The concerns over a higher limit allowing the blockchain to be filled with dust/spam are justified IMO, and warrant a solution like an elastic/flex cap, but concerns over a Bitcoin network, supported by an economy 1000X bigger than today's, not being able to handle 3,000 tps, without losing its trustlessness and censorship resistance, are not.

The path forward Satoshi left is much larger blocks:


-Satoshi Nakamoto
No matter what you think about Satoshi's original wisdom, and Bitcoin's original vision, Mike Hearn has been absolutely right about the history of the block size limit, and how it has been kludged into a tool to impose a new vision of a Bitcoin network that is consumer-validated at scale, even if it means average transaction fees [rising to $20](
I would argue that we should try to achieve consensus for a more decentralization-friendly limit policy for Bitcoin, where the limit increases at the rate of broadband growth, but we should be clear that the original consensus, which we are changing, is for larger blocks and a consolidated network, and therefore we need to achieve consensus on keeping blocks small. We should be honest and admit that the default position, absent reaching that consensus, is the original-vision of large blocks.

Keep in mind that BIP 100 has a major downward bias toward the limit. It takes 80% to increase it, and only 20% to decrease it. This makes it highly unlikely that the limit will increase without wide consensus.


If anything can kill Bitcoin, it's hard forks. The current situation is ample of evidence of that. When the Bitcoin community is larger, it will most likely simply become impossible to do any further hard forks. Making Bitcoin's future scalability dependent on a further hard fork is extremely dangerous. The BIP 100 mechanism eliminates the risk of hard forks from the process of changing the limit. A future proofed BIP 100 makes Bitcoin anti-fragile.

You're being intellectually dishonest. Your goal in implementing FSU (First Seen Unsafe) RBF is to 0-conf txs more vulnerable to double spends, and hence sabotage them.

Lightning Network is far too speculative and untested to give the market the confidence that Bitcoin activity will be able to scale.


I think you're referring to it becoming more difficult to run a full node with larger blocks. If so, my response is that I think the risk of Bitcoin activity becoming restricted all over the world by government bans is much graver than the prospect of a lower percentage of Bitcoin users being able to run full nodes, so I think large blocks would be a major positive overall.

I agree. I really would like to see compromise on this, and a solution the whole community can agree to.

What I suggested was sipa's proposal modified to have an initial increase to 8 MB and the annual growth rate increased from 17.8% to 21%, with an agreement to soft fork down if the bandwidth growth doesn't keep pace.
Perhaps non-hard-limit methods could be used to address the centralization risks associated with an initial increase of the limit to 8 MB, like promoting download of the full node client on  (it can include a disclaimer warning of the resource requirements, but still advertise the benefits that running a full node provides to the network and to personal privacy), or doing a Lighthouse fundraiser to raise funds for bounties for open-source mining software that encourages distributed validation.

This is the great danger of sacrificing adoption for greater full node accessibility (which is where much of the impetus for the extremely conservative position on the block size limit comes from). Adoption is what protects against the greatest threat to decentralized electronic cash: political attack. Once institutional repression of an activity has been normalized, it becomes very hard to eliminate that repression, and the reverse is also true: once an activity becomes widely practiced, it becomes very hard to repress it (eg. the use of physical cash, it's been grandfathered into the otherwise highly repressive financial system).

Thanks for putting that together. It's worth noting however that the limited amount of research done is highly theoretical, and does not constitute proof. Furthermore, Satoshi never explicitly said Bitcoin should have no blocksize cap, only that it should be able to scale to mass-adoption levels (he gave Visa-level volumes as an example). 
Between the sparseness of evidence suggesting large blocks would be harmful - limited to a handful of theoretical studies, a limited effect seen in a highly simplified simulation, and conjecture on the cause of the post March-2013 full node count drop - and the very clear direction the project was set in when announced in 2008, I think Gavin's plan, which does not call for unlimited block sizes, and permanently caps the block size in 2035, has the most appropriate block size limit increase schedule.

Once SHA256 ASICs become commodified, ASIC miners can start to be used as resistors in electric space heaters, which could very well drastically decentralise mining. It's also worth noting that even without dual use of mining ASICs, mining concentrates where cheap energy is found, and cheap energy has some natural inclination toward being dispersed (though government policy, like the Chinese government's subsidization of electricity, can have the reverse effect at the cross-country level).

This right here makes the current level of decentralization the floor, as if it has special significance and is not just an arbitrary level established by the chance of circumstance. Arbitrary principles like this will divide rather than unite.
I think a Constitution of sorts is a great idea, but it should be flexible enough to acknowledge our incomplete knowledge. I think it ought to be limited to a concrete plan that the developers can unite around, for example (if it were up to me):
 "all undersigned agree that the limit should be raised in increments, in response to growth in demand for transaction space, until 8 MB, and thereafter not increase at a rate that exceeds the growth of bandwidth".
This would give the community the united vision needed to shepherd the limit steadily, and carefully, as the need demands it, and technological change allows it.
I think equally important to the united vision that a Constitution could provide, is a better technical process for changing the limit than the clumsy and dangerous hard fork process encumbering limit decreases or increases.
I think a BIP 100 like solution would be ideal. Consensus means almost nothing without definition, and BIP 100 defines it, in the protocol, as a threshold level of hash power. This formalizes and clarifies the process of reaching consensus and prevents fragmentation of the network when disagreements inevitably arise.

They would also help increase decentralization at a given scale by allowing smaller players to contribute to validation. If for instance there were 100 sidechains, each with 1 MB blocks, you would have far more people participating in validation than if you had 1 sidechain with 100 MB blocks, because the resource threshold for becoming a validator would be higher in the latter.

You're right about the security advantage. However, I would argue it's not an insurmountable competitive barrier for a clone to scale. As long as the odds of a successful &gt;50% attack are reasonably low, a smaller clone could conceivably close the market share gap between itself and bitcoin.


This only provides a benefit insofar as it increases liquidity. Exchange infrastructure for example provides more places where one can exchange BTC for other currencies, which makes it a more useful store of wealth and currency. Widespread use as a transactional currency takes this much further still, by providing a person with thousands upon thousands of points of exchange where they can convert their BTC for goods/services.
If BTC were limited to only being used as a store of wealth, ie an investment vehicle, its competitive position would be much much weaker than it is now, as both an investment vehicle and a transactional currency. In other words, BTC's use as a transactional currency greatly complements its use as a store of wealth.

The original vision of Bitcoin was full nodes that only data centers could run.

Welcome to Reddit!
Removing the ability of the average person to run a full node doesn't make the Bitcoin economy centralized, trust-based, or censored. There is no requirement for the average person to be able to run a full node, for Bitcoin to be true to its promise, which is exactly why in the mailing list where Bitcoin was announced in 2008, the idea of specialists replacing ordinary people in running full nodes as the network scaled was an accepted course of events.
And you have provided no supporting evidence for your fearmongering about SPV clients having "atrocious security and privacy". SPV clients are secure as long as &gt;50% of the network hashrate is honest and they are not isolated from the peer-to-peer network, which are safe security assumptions to make. Their privacy is configurable as well, as they are able to download ALL txs, at the expense of more bandwidth costs.

Bitcoin is not a precious metal. It can be cloned. What gives it a unique value proposition against clones is its network effect, which is largely based on use as a transactional currency. Also, any commodity's function as a store of value is improved by greater liquidity, and merchant acceptance boosts liquidity, by providing more places where the store of value can be converted into other goods/services.

It's not the network's value. It's their coins. If it was the network's value, you wouldn't be allowed to trade it for altcoins on another chain, or destroy the value by sending it to a blackhole, but you currently can, so it's not.

Yes, because Satoshi was the lead developer, so he could easily have a different perspective on how easy/difficult it is to change one of Bitcoin's consensus rules. The way he describes how "he" would put in an "alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade" would support the notion that he held the perspective that it wouldn't be hard to change. 
That makes more sense than him secretly having a plan for the 1 MB limit that contradicts nearly everything he wrote about how Bitcoin would scale.

If there were no 1 MB limit, I honestly believe we would be in the early stages of Bitcoin entering into mass adoption, making projects like these obsolete.

They currently do. Thanks to widespread employment of FSP, people have the option of using probabilistically-somewhat-secure 0-conf txs.


It's enforceable by individual nodes. Just because something isn't enforced by the consensus rules doesn't make it completely useless. Only time will tell if it is continues to be voluntarily adopted and have uses into the future. As long as a significant portion of users find 0-conf txs useful in some applications, I don't see any reason to push to change default client behaviour to eliminate FSP.

If the later hard fork only had to get rid of the 32 MB network message size limit, it might be a lot easier to get through than if it also has to change BIP 100's limit. Also, a new messaging protocol might be rolled out by then that cancels the need to do a hard fork for the network size limit.

@_date: 2015-07-24 20:33:37
You're misrepresenting me, and ignoring the elephant in the room: your suggestion that a Tx has to complete transmission before another can be sent, which would limit the network's throughput to the rate at which one Tx can be propagated across the world at a time, but which in reality, is not a limitation on Tx propagation (you can send MBs of Txs across the planet simultaneously).

A chain fork where the longest chain is invalid is an extremely rare event. It's happened two times in Bitcoin's history. Your claim of SPV being totally insecure is not supported by the evidence. In reality, it's secure, outside of very rare events that are kept rare by the incentives of system.

Regardless, there will always be cases where on-chain is preferable to the user to off-blockchain, so all things being equal, higher transaction fees will reduce Bitcoin's perceived utility, and thus harm adoption. Good offchain solutions are also at the drawing board stage, so even if they work as a perfect drop in substitute for on-chain transactions (a huge assumption, that would be dangerous and irresponsible to rely-on and plan scalability around), adoption would still be seriously harmed until they are deployed.


Yes, it's better. However, that's not the choice we're offered. There's no proof that the system will become centralized, which I assume we both take to mean 'centralized enough to become permissioned', if an unrestrained version of BIP 100, or BIP 101, is adopted. It's better to risk centralization and have a shot at mass adoption than seriously risk Bitcoin never achieving mass adoption and guarantee its decentralization. We have plenty of decentralized altcoins that will never have a major global impact. We don't need Bitcoin to be like them.

We can argue semantics forever, but better to avoid that.. What I meant is that large blocks allow Bitcoin to scale in transaction throughput, which allows a larger scale of economic activity to be conducted on the network.
Larger blocks come at the cost of decreasing the percentage of users that run full nodes, but, under the right conditions, could boost full node decentralization overall, by increasing the percentage of the population that uses Bitcoin, which in turn increases the percentage of the population that runs a full node. The 'right conditions' would be if there is sufficient fee pressure (e.g. $0.02 per tx) to ensure that increases in block space use are being accompanied by a sufficient increase in economic activity so as to ensure the economic support for full node operation (e.g. number of people with an economic interest in auditing the blockchain) is growing faster than the economic cost of running full nodes.

Things could develop very differently than what the article predicts.

You have provided no evidence for this. You provided evidence that a single quad core cannot handle that many verifications. In a Bitcoin economy 1000X bigger than today's, there would be no shortage of parties with more than 1 quad-core that they can dedicate to running a full node.
Furthermore, not only will hardware performance likely improve by the time the network sees those volumes, but the more efficient ECDSA validation code that is currently being tested for Bitcoin Core will likely be ready for live action.

Bitcoin could very well be cheaper than an internal database transfer, because the latter is controlled by a trusted third party that 1. has a captive market that's locked into its proprietary network, in a market where barriers to entry are very high due to utility being a function of network effect (which is why Visa and MC have such secure market positions), 2. can be forced by government and its regulatory agencies to put in place controls that add friction to the the transaction process.

I know what he's saying, but he's simply wrong about what it takes to use the Lightning Network. You can't escape the need to create a Bitcoin transaction to start using the LN. 
No third party is going to spend $20 to create a LN channel to you unless they're sending you thousands of dollars. For the 2.8 billion people earning less than $2 a day, they would never be receiving that much money at once, or even over an extended period of time, for someone else to pay a $20 fee for the Bitcoin transaction necessary to create a LN channel to them.

And each person will need far more than 2 settlements per year to have any sort of financial privacy. You can't have all of your LN txs flowing through one or two peers or else they will know your entire payment history. Furthermore, it needs to be cheap to form new payment channels, or else the switching costs of connecting to new LN nodes will lead to an ossified LN network that is slow to adapt and evolve, which in turn favours larger nodes and encourages centralisation. For all these reasons, blocks would need to be far larger than 133 MB to serve the entire world, even assuming the LN works exactly as well as promised (which is a huge assumption).

Voting pools are just centralized payment processors with federated security. They're a small notch about PayPal for censorship resistance. And it's "if for some reason LN doesn't" work. With $20 transaction fees, it DEFINITELY will not work for most people. 
Most of the world makes $2 a day. $20 transaction fees means you need to transact over $1,000 at a time to make it economic, which means most of the world will never use Sidechains or the Lightning Network. 


You need to do an on-chain transaction to form a channel with a hub. So if the hub you're connected to starts censoring your transactions, it costs $20 to do an on-chain transaction to close the channel you have to them, and another on-chain transaction, costing $20, to create a channel with new, non-censoring hub.
Learn how the LN works before irresponsibly pushing for the Bitcoin community to commit self-destruction by embracing $20 transaction fees.

I don't know for sure if there are any advantages. There could be advantages from having federated security (you need m of n signatures to execute a withdrawal of BTC from the Fed-Peg sidechain).
However, compared to other permissioned blockchain systems, I see the Fed-Peg variation, which already has the BTC transferability built in, as being better. Major financial institutions are already looking at using permissioned blockchains, so why not encourage them to choose a variant with public blockchain (Bitcoin) interoperability?

Why not do BIP 100, and then reassess in 4 years? That way, if a broad consensus can't be reached about what hard fork to implement, at least the limit is not at 8 MB with the community having no process but an extremely dangerous/contentious hard fork conflict to raise it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:31:40


This is most likely true. But there is a theoretical risk that with a new propagation protocol like IBLT, which reduces the orphan risk attached to creating large blocks, miners controlling a large share of the network hashrate will steadily increase the block size with too-low-fee txs, because due to the scale of their operation, they can still profit on low-fee txs, while smaller miners cannot.

Nice, centralized control. How are they going to use LN when it costs $20 to create a single channel with a hub? What happens when the hub starts regulating what who they can transact with? Remember it costs $20 to close the channel, and another $20 to open a new one with a different hub, and they only earn $2 a day. They can't afford to pay three weeks salary on just transaction fees. And how are they even going to start using the LN when the high transaction fee requires transacting over $1,000, that they don't have, for it to be economical.

17%/year wouldn't be THAT bad (though realistically, it would need to be raised to at least 21-25% to leave room for faster than expected bandwidth growth, and to get consensus support, IMO), but I agree that not having an initial increase to 8 MB would be a lost opportunity, and make Bitcoin much less competitive over the long run.
Actually, my preference would be that we don't try to predict how much space we will need and how fast bandwidth will grow, and simply let a supermajority of hashpower change the limit when there is consensus that a change is needed. There are too many unknowns to try to bake in the limit growth rate 20-60 years into the future. Fixing how we arrive at consensus on the block size limit, so that we don't need to do a hard fork every time we need to change the limit, would allow Bitcoin to quickly adapt to its circumstances and avoid the risk of getting locked into a limit that's too high or too low due to inertia.

Increasing the block size increases the magnitude of known variables. It doesn't introduce an entirely new and untested technology, like the LN, so I strongly disagree.


No they don't. By using unique addresses for each inbound transfer, and merge avoidance, not to mention CoinJoin, the common ownership of a set of transfers can be kept private. To do the same with payment channels, you need a unique payment channel for each transfer, thus defeating their purpose.


If there are only enough on-chain txs for each person to do 2 per year, that would create massive demand for available block space, leading to very high tx fees. There is no way to limit txs to 2 per person per year without creating extreme scarcity of space.

Very clever of you to tie in blockchain.info's real and alleged failings, with the &gt;3 tps hard fork proposal. This is a rhetorical trick called a guilt by association smear.


for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.


would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.


sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

Peter Todd is on record as saying he's okay with transaction fees of $20:
Average transaction fees of $0.20 might be tolerable if Bitcoin is providing tremendous added-value by enabling sophisticated off-chain solutions, but if a payment network that costs $20 to use is what Bitcoin needs to turn into to remain 'decentralized', then Bitcoin is a failed experiment in my opinion, so as far as I'm concerned, we have nothing to lose from going for larger blocks, to keep fees reasonably low. 
The truth is, we don't know if Bitcoin will lose its decentralization and permissionlessness with larger blocks. But we do know that Bitcoin will become too expensive to use for most use-cases and most of the world's population if blocks are not allowed to grow somewhat proportionally with demand, and Bitcoin is adopted globally.

The LN could in many ways be superior to conventional usage of Bitcoin, but *could* is a long way from *is*.

We should certainly put stock in the technical arguments of the most technically literate people, but their economic and political arguments, like how many full nodes the network needs to remain resistant to global efforts by governments to censor it, or which provides more privacy/security-from-Sybil-attack/censorship/etc: read-access (small blocks) or write-access (large blocks), or how many people will run full nodes with a given hard limit, are no more credible than those of anyone else who is equally involved in the Bitcoin space.
Some of the very technically literate people in the Bitcoin space encountered Bitcoin, and dismissed it years ago, some as early in 2009, and only bought in years later (e.g. 2012 or later), meaning they didn't have the market-dynamics/economic insight to see its potential as quickly as many others, and thus proving that technical knowledge of the intricacies of the reference client and protocol doesn't prove superior knowledge of the economic qualities of Bitcoin.

I believe anyone who wants Bitcoin to fail as a project that makes a significant and direct global impact will want the protocol to remain limited to the absurdly low 1.67 KB/s ave throughput limit, and therefore will try to steer the debate on the block size issue to that conclusion.

Why would opt-in RBF have any expensive beyond the inclusion of a flag? How expensive is a flag to indicate the tx can be RBFed?

Because fee pressure ensures the use of block space is economically validated. Fee payment is proof of value.

If they're going to be using a permissioned blockchain, isn't it better for global financial infrastructure if it is of the Fed-Peg variety, which has built in interoperability with Bitcoin's public blockchain?
Also, as an aside, I'll address this:


My only point is that there are multiple signers in a ledger with a federated security model, rather than just one. That could end up being an advantage over existing ledger systems, because there are more points of failure. Of course, it may end up being a negligible advantage in practice, due to inherent weakness in the trusted third party model, or one that could easily be replicated in existing ledger systems with some trivial adjustments.

The reason I can transfer $20 worth of BTC to Japan for a fee of 1 cent worth of BTC is because of that censorship resistance. Systems that dont have trustless censorship resistance cost more to use in many applications. The Bitcoin white paper explains why. The trustless censorship resistance is a means to an end, and that end is reducing the personal cost to do the things we want in the manner we want to do them (e.g. not giving up privacy in the process). Cost-effectiveness is therefore the best measure of utility.

That you made this claim is not something you can conceal. You made this absurd claim so that you could maintain the argument that the network cannot do thousands of txs per second.

A conversion-triggering reorganization on the SC is not recoverable, as it is on the main chain, because SC-coins are backed by BTC on the main chain, and would irreversibly lose that backing should a SC reorg above the threshold block length, that fraudulently transfers the backing BTC back to the main chain, occur.


The idea that Bitcoin can evolve by having a semi-trusted large-block sidechain is absurd to me. Whatever the scaling solution is, it needs to be a complete solution, meaning as decentralized and trustless as the main chain. Maybe you're right that security can be sacrificed, but this sacrifice is going to something that is going to make the scale-through-SC idea unpopular.

Sidechains are not main chain. They can never be as secure. The original plan declared for Bitcoin when it was announced in a mailing list in 2008 was for it to be a large layer-0 protocol, not a small layer-0 protocol serving as a backbone for overlay protocols like sidechains and the LN. 
Therefore, to be true to Bitcoin's original vision, the (originally meant to be temporary) 1 MB anti-spam limit needs to be removed and replaced with something that allows it to handle a far higher volume of transactions at some point in the future. Doing otherwise is similar to changing the 21 million coin limit: it's breaking the original promise of the protocol, which cannot be justified, even if we find that a deflationary currency is sub-optimal.
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:26:43
True, and to add to that, I think the high block subsidy period might be a golden opportunity to grow the Bitcoin economy, as tx fees can be kept low without compromising security.
However, I think there's something to be said for keeping really low value data - filler - out of the blockchain, and a block size limit that exerts even a minimal amount of fee pressure goes a long way in doing that.

It's safe to assume that miners are going to eventually use compressed blocks for propagation, and nodes are not going to need to validate each tx a second time when a block is generated.

2WP SC coins are backed by BTC suspended on the main chain. The reverse is not true. From the sidechains white paper:
*Reorganisations of arbitrary depth are in principle possible, which could allow an attacker to completely transfer coins between sidechains before causing a reorganisation longer than the contest period on the sending chain to undo its half of the transfer. The result would be an imbalance between the number of coins on the recipient chain and the amount of locked output value backing them on the sending chain. If the attacker is allowed to return the transferred coins to the original chain, he would increase the number of coins in his possession at the expense of other users of the sidechain.*


It's absolutely clear that the general plan was for Bitcoin to have a large layer 0. What Satoshi didn't know was how to prevent spam/bloat from filling block with a higher limit, and that's most likely why he didn't time in a block size increase.
When Bitcoin was announced in 2008, it included very very (**very!**) clear explanations of how the Bitcoin would scale, with the network consolidating into fewer and larger nodes, handling Visa-scale transaction volumes, and this vision totally contradicts the vision for Bitcoin that those who are most opposed to a larger block size are promoting.
It doesn't matter how good and right the latter vision is: it's not the original promise of Bitcoin, and therefore it should not be forced into the network without consensus across the community (which clearly it doesn't have).


This is a debate about the generalities of the block size issue, not specific proposals. Generally, Bitcoin must become a large layer-0 protocol to remain true to its original promise, that was declared when the project was announced in a mailing list in 2008. Changing Bitcoin's design goals without consensus from the community goes against the ethos of Bitcoin, just as changing the 21 million coin limit would be. 
In fact, without consensus, Bitcoin must become a network where only specialists, running data centers, can run full nodes at its greatest scale. But, I think we can get consensus across the community to pair down that original vision, and limit Bitcoin's resource requirements so that anyone with a single high-end consumer-grade PC and high-end consumer grade broadband connection can run a full node. What we will never be able to get consensus for is demands that Bitcoin be limited in scale to guarantee that anyone be able to run a full node on a 56K modem, or be able to run one through TOR, or some other equally uncompromising view on full-validation accessibility.


I haven't proposed a specific solution. Your attitude is asinine and childish. Let's deal with one thing at a time. Right now we're debating whether Bitcoin's original specifications call for it to be large-layer 0 protocol or a small layer-0 protocol at large scale adoption.

And we very likely don't get a redo if using Bitcoin becomes a restricted activity around the world because it didn't scale quickly enough. I acknowledge the risks that you and others have highlighted. They exist. However, not driving forward adoption and scale of activity as quickly as possible also has its own risks. The primary risk is that governments begin to censor and restrict Bitcoin activity, because the proportion of the public that has bought into the network and is willing to fight against political attacks on it isn't large enough by the time those attacks are launched.
Governments move slow, but they do move, inexorably, toward restricting and controlling human activity. A new technology has a limited window of opportunity to become ubiquitous and part of the culture, before the hammer of control comes down on it. Therefore, holding off on the limit increase, and thereby stunting the Bitcoin economy by not providing a clear path forward, has its own risks, that have to be weighed against the risks that higher full node operation costs impose.
For what it's worth, Maxwell's argument that an exponential limit increase can be dangerous because it might exceed the rate of technological performance improvement resonated with me, and convinced me that of all the proposals, Garzik's is the best. It gives the network the flexibility to adapt to the state of technological cost performance, while eliminating one of the gravest threats from the future of Bitcoin: needing to do a hard fork to raise the limit.
@_date: 2015-07-11 17:26:04

Hands down the best proposal for deciding on what limit solution to use.

So the manufacturer who sells 1 million of the firecrackers to a dozen resellers doesn't get prosecuted or even receive a fine, but a 22 year with no criminal record gets 10 months in federal prison. Yea makes a lot of sense.
I believe Ver when he says it was because of the political positions he espoused:
Maybe the political statements Ver made that allegedly prompted the federal government to prosecute him were inflammatory and offended the agents involved, but I think prosecuting him to punish him for it is an affront to free speech, that has a chilling effect on the freedom to criticize the government.
Is it possible that federal agents pressed for charges because of his political statements? Given the revelations of rampant abuse of power by two agents involved in the Silk Road investigation recently, I think it is entirely possible. After all, we can safely assume that many cases of misconduct and corruption by government agents are never discovered. Human egos and flaws can affect LE agents just as easily as any other type of worker.

But total transaction fees have increased as transaction volumes have increased, despite blocks being below the hard limit (and therefore people not having to compete to get their transactions into blocks). The evidence therefore suggests that if fees matter, then we need larger blocks, with more transactions, so that miners earn more transaction fees.
If you're arguing that miners are enforcing minimum transaction fees because fees don't currently matter (due to the subsidy of new bitcoins), and that they'll no longer enforce it when they care about transaction fees, that's still no reason to set the hard cap at 1 MB per block. If the hard cap was something higher, like 200 MB per block, there would still be scarcity, just at a higher limit, allowing fees on far more txs to be collected per block.

No one said Bitcoin should lose its decentralization. The arguments being made for larger blocks are the following:
* Block size can be increased without reducing decentralization by limiting the rate of increase to the rate at which bandwidth grows
* Decentralization can be reduced significantly without Bitcoin's level of decentralization falling to below the level needed to remain censorship resistant.
* It's the percentage of the world population, and not the percentage of the Bitcoin userbase, that validates, that defines the level of decentralization, and it's entirely possible the former will not suffer as the network's transaction throughput increases.
Claiming Bitcoin will become centralized with any straightforward O(N) scaling solution is fearmongering IMO. There are risks with any solution, and the risk of stagnation, which contains within it the potential for a significant opportunity cost loss, as well as lower resistance to political attack, is totally ignored by analyses like yours.

It's the opposite. No financial institution or financial system is going to trust a permissioned ledger with trusted validators in other jurisdictions, because trusted validators form a centralized governing structure that is vulnerable to political pressure and therefore unreliable for stakeholders outside of the validator's jurisdiction. They also don't want to be locked into a proprietary platform that could potentially obtain a monopoly in the fund transfer market and raise prices without the threat of competition. That means you need a permissionless ledger, that is immune to political pressure and not susceptible to monopoly pricing, and thus reliable for all participants, to act as an intermediary between different financial institutions and systems, in order to integrate the global financial system.

They could secretly build on a different chain that double spends txs on the public chain and then release it after a few hours. That would cause a massive disruption, but you're right that they could only do this once. In fact, it could probably only happen once, period. After such an attack, safeguards will be put in place to prevent it from ever happening again (e.g. all pools will switch to getBlockTemplate that returns the power to select transactions to hashers).

There is no contract that node operators agree to that lays out that a person downloading the software and running the node will only propagate and store transactions that represent nothing beyond stock currency transfers. The only rules are those of the protocol, which do not discriminate between straight stock currency transactions and those representing the transfer of other assets.


The issue is not one of subjective significance of the data. It's of amount of data. Larger amounts of data compromise decentralization. The amount of data should therefore be limited to ensure an adequate level of decentralization, and what that data is should be determined by the market.

Databases were designed with the assumption that only trusted parties have direct access. The Bitcoin blockchain architecture has the opposite design assumption. I'm speaking outside my depth, so maybe you're right, but it just seems to me to likely be easier to port the Bitcoin architecture to a centrally controlled, publicly distributed database model, than to port a traditional database to such a model.

I think being first is an advantage that can be overcome. The first implementation of a technology does not always win. I also think changing Bitcoin from a payment system, as originally envisioned, to a low velocity wannabe digital gold, would be the change here, not following through with the original plan and raising the temporary 1.67 KB/s anti-spam limit (an absurdly low throughout limit for any global payment OR settlement network).


Gold has unique scarcity. No metal can be invented that could ever have its combination of scarcity and unique properties. Bitcoin CAN be cloned, and a clone COULD replicate its properties. The credibility of its scarcity relies on those qualities that differentiate it from its clones, and one the most potent and hard-to-mimic is its network effect. That is why it's so vitally important that any quality that can boost its network effect be enhanced, and one of these is utility as a payment system.

A PM I received has caused me to reassess the claim made by If Satoshi's statement of **"prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency"** is taken at face value, then a 'fraud proof' of sort was envisioned in the white paper, in the form of a full block. In my opinion, the reference to "the full block" was a typo, and was meant to say "the full block chain". 
Furthermore, even if at one point, against any reason I can conceive, Satoshi believed a full block would prove a tx is invalid, I find it highly unlikely that he still believed that was the case in 2010, when he was still promoting a future Bitcoin network where most users used lightweight clients that relied on the SPV method.
All this being said, there are very dangerous 51% attacks, that could potentially net the attacker a significant sum of money, against SPV nodes. As Bitcoin grows, and the stakes, as well as the incentives to launch a large scale theft against SPV nodes, grows, it is arguably necessary to implement various commitments into the blockchain to improve SPV security, if this method is to be widely relied upon.
An alert doesn't mean "fraud proof". In fact, if he meant 'fraud proof', why would he say the user would then download the full block? A fraud proof would not require anything to be downloaded by the user.


Because you are claiming Satoshi wrote something that he didn't, so you don't want to look at the semantics, which show he didn't.

Right, reducing orphan rates at a given block size increases the risk that we'll see large blocks, but reduces the centralization risk that those large blocks pose. Whether the exacerbative effect of low orphan rates on block size growth is outweighed by the mitigative effect of low orphan rates on the centralization risk posed by large blocks, I don't know.
One solution would be to deploy IBLT and rely on the block size limit to prevent out of control block size growth. That way you get the best of both worlds: lower centralization risk posed by larger blocks, thanks to IBLT, and limits on the growth of block size, thanks to the block size limit.

You're not making any sense and now insulting me for calling you out on it.


More than one person can use a road. For the Lightning Network, you need a dedicated channel for a person to join the Lightning Network trustlessly. If it costs $20 to set up a payment channel, then it means it costs $20 in transaction fees for each person that joins the Lightning Network, and that's ignoring payment channel renewal and switching costs, not to mention the extra costs of peering with additional nodes.


To use the Lightning Network without the risk of the third party stealing your coins, you need your BTC secured by a dedicated payment channel, which again, costs a tx fee per user to set up. How do you claim that a person can join the LN without a dedicated payment channel being set up, with your claim that infinity people can use a payment channel?


And I go back to my point: it's dangerous to be in a situation where "claiming your funds" is prohibitively expensive (costs $20).

1. 20% of the hashrate can veto any block size limit increase attempt, and it's the minimum of the top 80% of the values voted for that becomes the new limit, meaning only very conservative limit increases, that have wide-consensus, are likely to be green-lighted.
2. It's very easy for anyone to buy ASICs and participate in the vote for the block size limit.
3. Miners, meaning those who own mining equipment, are economic stakeholders in the Bitcoin economy, and have an interest in it succeeding. If Bitcoin tanks, so does the value of their mining equipment. Therefore it is totally reasonable to have the limit chosen by a super-majority of them.

With $20 transaction fees, only transactions worth over $1,000 will be economical. That means the vast majority of the world's population would never have access to the blockchain. 
As for having 'too much security' relative to the amount of value stored or whatever.. you're forgetting that when we're talking about Bitcoin, we're talking about a technological quantum leap. It used to be impossible to store more than 5 MB on a USB flash drive. Now you can store 2 TB. Does anyone really need to be able to store 2,000 movies on a thumb drive? It doesn't matter, because now you can!
Technology lets us have more than we ever had before. No reason to set the bar low and say that it's not right to have more.. So yes, we CAN have the security of 50 bodyguards securing 20 cents of value, and we can have it cheaply and in decentralized form.

That however doesn't mean there are no negative consequences for the large banks from having a government that has virtually unlimited power to intervene in the market.

I was thinking that txs that contain such proofs could be treated differently with respect to the block size limit. That is where the economic incentive would come from. For example, if they are counted as 4 bits toward the limit, for every 8 bits of size, then economic theory tells us that they should have fees that are half that of non-proof-containing txs. 
As for encouraging people to run a full node: the objective is actually to make it easier to run a full node by lowering the limit. The economic incentive to provide proofs is mostly there to increase the information the network has on the full node distribution, so that the limit can be adjusted accordingly (full node decentralization levels above some standard would cause the block size limit to increase, while levels below the standard would cause it to decrease). The incentive it provides to run a full node is just an added bonus.

That's a loaded question. Are you employing rhetorical tricks on purpose, &gt; The point is, Mike suggested the idea of redlisting for Bitcoin. 
He did not propose any redlisting idea. That's the point. He floated the idea for discussion. People should be free to discuss any idea. If it's a bad idea, it is immediately exposed as such, and the person stops pursuing it. That is what happened with Hearn's redlist idea. 
It's repeatedly brought up years after the fact in debates that have nothing to do with it in order to attack Hearn's character, in an attempt to indirectly discredit his arguments. It's a cheap, disingenuous debate tactic that is often employed by throwaway accounts.
Furthermore, over-reacting to this extent to the mere discussion of an idea deemed to be bad will have a chilling effect on free expression, leading to less collaborative brainstorming, which requires a tolerance for a good dose of bad ideas to be effective. Using what Hearn wrote in what was an informal discussion forum against him years later in a totally unrelated debate, by an endless stream throwaway accounts, is exactly the opposite of showing tolerance to bad ideas expressed while brainstorming.


No that is not enough. And whatever his views at one time about a different topic, it has absolutely nothing to do with the arguments he's made about the block size limit, which stand on their own merits, and are totally independent of the person making them.
These attacks on Hearn are a classic example of ad hominem. It's not alright just because you happen to disagree with the arguments being made by the person being subjected to ad hominem attacks.

What about this:


@_date: 2015-09-02 04:07:28
Let's assume for a moment that this attack vector is mitigated by placing sensible upper and lower bounds on the growth of the max block size. In that case, the most the 21% could do is freeze growth in the block size limit at some low level (e.g. 0% a year), which is no worse than the situation we're in now.


Because we will have to do hard fork(s) that change the limit, which involve all of those things anyway. If the limit is going to be changed, let's have a formal process in the consensus rules that streamlines how it happens and reduce the risks that surround it. It's true that there would be less complexity if we went with a predefined schedule for the limit, but that doesn't mean there would be less risk. I've outlined the risks of trying to predict, right now, what limit will be appropriate decades from now, above.


That could very well be an effective strategy too, but it might run into a lot of opposition from Core devs, who seem pretty keen on using the hard limit as a tool to fine tune the average block size.

Factom doesn't bloat the blockchain. It uses a single commit every time interval to timestamp its blockchain in the Bitcoin blockchain. The amount of data time-stamped to bloat added to the Bitcoin blockchain is terrific.
And Bitcoin should be data neutral. There's no reason one type of data is abusive, and another is not. There's no contract signed when one downloads the Bitcoin software saying only data for bitcoin transactions will be stored on the blockchain. If there's an issue of bloat, it should be dealt with in a neutral matter, with general solutions like pruning and fees, not with discriminating use-cases based on political determinations.

It does matter. If it didn't matter, Bitcoin could have its limit reduced to 10 KB, and block times increased to 3 hours, and it would make no difference to its competitiveness versus closed systems. Open systems can lose to closed systems if the latter has enough of a network effect advantage against them. See Linux vs Windows on the desktop. 
Bitcoin needs to ensure it doesn't have a too low or too high block size limit. The Lightning Network creators provided a good analogy of the block size limit spectrum being a bathtub with two failure outcomes on either side, and a large success area in the middle:
3 tps is a shockingly low throughput limit that is already causing a "Fidelity Effect", where major Bitcoin projects are prevented from going ahead, so could very well be in the far left of the bath tub.
Keeping Bitcoin network's transaction throughput limit low and thus causing adoption growth to slow is extremely risky IMO. Much more so than the potential for too large blocks undermining Bitcoin's censorship resistance.

You're afflicted by an over-confidence in your powers of inference. You do not know what Satoshi was thinking or why. You cannot presume to know with confidence that he was lying to his detractors in order to sneak in a hard to raise limit. There are very plausible alternative explanations, like him having a very different view of the difficulty of raising the limit because he was the lead developer and was very influential, so was much more capable of effecting a hard fork than the average member of the community, and that this blinded him to the difficulties that those without his influence on the course of Bitcoin development could see.
Your conceit in the infallibility of your inferences is what leads you to adopt this far-fetched conspiracy theory about Satoshi lying to the entire Bitcoin community in numerous comments to essentially trick them into accepting a limit that would turn Bitcoin into a low-velocity settlement network.
If you persist with this attitude, I'm going to stop discussing this with you. It's a waste of my time to debate someone who ignores clear evidence when it conflicts with his own intuition, out of an over-inflated opinion of the importance of the latter.

I agree with you, but arguing against regulatory bans requires arguing against their political premise, which requires taking an ideological/political position. For example, you can't just say "Bitcoin shouldn't be banned for those who don't have a license", and not give political reasoning for one's opposition to the measure. In this case, you'd have to explain, from a Big Picture perspective, why banning unrestricted access to a technology, to deal with some immediate threat, is harmful in principle.

You're under a dangerous illusion that people will hold Bitcoin solely because it is scarce and censorship resistant, like gold. Unlike gold, it can be cloned. A thousand other coins professing the same scarcity can take market share from it. What has historically kept Bitcoin's position secure against clones is the belief among investors that it will become the standard way in which to transfer wealth digitally, and that the network effect this gives it will make its market position unassailable from altcoins.
The longer mass adoption of Bitcoin as a platform to transfer value is delayed, the more investors will lose confidence.

You're once again promoting a dangerously over-confident assessment of Bitcoin's current position.
It is not currently "digital gold". It has a market cap of merely $3 billion, very little of it is held by high net worth individuals and major financial institutions, and very few people in general use it.


Gold was adopted by millions of people as a transactional currency at one point. Gold coins circulated widely in several empires, and were used as money. Gold was also genuinely scarce, with no possibility of a clone usurping it. Bitcoin's competitive advantage over its clones comes solely from its network effect and hashrate, both of which are heavily dependent on its use as a transactional currency, and speculation that it will grow significantly into the future.
Without mainstream adoption, in the form of widespread use as a transactional currency, there is no hope of Bitcoin becoming digital gold. 
Once again: that you have overly confident fantasies about billionaires and major financial institutions investing significant sums of capital into a barely traded, easily cloned digital currency, that cannot scale to allow any other significant uses, doesn't mean Bitcoin needs to hobble itself to accommodate you.

That is what I'm talking about. If individual users generate *a* number of transactions on average, the amount of work done by fully validating nodes increases at *aN*. Given *a* is more or less a constant, the workload for Bitcoin's full nodes increases at O(N), not O(N²).

No, it doesn't. It doesn't categorically do anything. It depends on how much economies of scale is added. 10 MB, 100 MB, and 1 TB blocks are all increased economies of scale, yet you're treating them as identical with respect to Bitcoin's censorship resistance.

Ver didn't say Gox was solvent. This is what Ver said in that video:


And it turns out the fiat withdrawals problems, which was the major issue that everyone was worried about at the time, were not due to lack of liquidity.
The BTC withdrawal problems came much later, and had nothing to do with this episode, which was related to the seizure of $5 million USD from MtGox's US bank account by the US government, and the  concerns at the time that MtGox didn't have enough fiat in their accounts to honor fiat withdrawals.
Ver verified that that wasn't the case. That's all he did. No one at the time presumed that Gox had a BTC shortfall, and the video had nothing to do with Gox's BTC holdings.
The reason why throwaway accounts appear, and lie about what Ver's MtGox comments, to try to discredit Ver to the maximum extent possible, any time the subject turns to him, is because of Ver's unorthodox political beliefs and his advocacy of them. All of these attacks on him are politically motivated.

* DS2 A rift among developers leads to a hard fork
* DS7 A forked version of the software gains ground 
* DS8 Satoshi Nakamoto reappears and says the project has gone wrong
Under "Threats to Decentralization - Mining", it includes risks like:
* DM1 Mining becomes too expensive for anyone but a small number of specialist
* DM5 A government makes mining subject to registration 
* DM6 Purchase of mining chips is subject to registration

A $20 transaction fee to participate in the LN is too high a cost to scale for someone making $10 a day.

This, taken in its own, would be a sort of fraud proof, but I'm pretty sure that it was apparent to everyone, very soon after Bitcoin launched, that downloading a single block would not prove a tx is invalid in the case where an attacker has 51% of the hashrate. Furthermore, I think the above was a typo, and was meant to say "download the full block chain". For these reasons, I think all of the statements Satoshi made in 2010 about most users relying on SPV clients was under the assumption that fraud proofs were not possible.

So the world's poor would be stuck with centralized services with $20 transaction fees. 


You need on-chain transactions to use the LN. If transaction fees are $20, most people won't be able to use the LN. Voting pools meanwhile are centralized, and therefore defeat the purpose of Bitcoin.


Most people are not going to send $1,000 to Silk Road, so for most cases, it will be impossible. It would only be useful for big banks and drug cartels which are moving large volumes of funds. But more realistically, transaction fees will never get to $20, and instead, Bitcoin will simply fail.

I think almost all of the security of Bitcoin comes from the low cost to participate as a full node and miner, and the global distribution of network nodes.

The common man didn't need to use whole gold coins for gold to be "adopted by millions of people as a transactional currency". Merchants, magistrates, and any one dealing with any amount of value could and would use whole gold coins due to their value density making it easier to transport large amounts of value. That still counts as "mainstream adoption", and is far more use than what Bitcoin can achieve with 3 tps.
Peasants, i.e. the common man, would use various types of commodity money, including copper coins, silver coins and cut gold coins. Gold was combined with lower value metals to make coins that could be used for every day trade. In Japan they used gold power, and elsewhere, gold grains.
Furthermore, gold always had tremendous value. It never went through a phase like Bitcoin, where a Bitcoin was worth $0.05. It was a scarce religious symbol before it was money. Its effective market cap, ever since it was discovered, was always huge. 
Bitcoin never had credible scarcity. Bitcoin's market gap grew from nothing to something with expectations of demand for its currency, and the security of its market position versus clones, increasing with its growth as a transactional currency. Your confidence in Bitcoin's market position, in claiming that it can be just like gold with no other sources of demand for it other than demand as a store of wealth, is dangerous for Bitcoin.


Gold was genuinely scarce, with no possibility of a clone usurping it. Bitcoin's competitive advantage over its clones comes solely from its network effect and hashrate, both of which are heavily dependent on its use as a transactional currency, and speculation that it will grow significantly into the future.

I disagree with the article. This is a conservative proposal for the following reason: a 80% vote threshold to increase the limit is substantial enough that it will effectively mean that only limit increase attempts that have wide consensus, and almost certainly support from reference implementation developers, will go into effect. For example, if there is a push to increase the limit that is rejected by Core developers, it's highly unlikely that more than 20% of the hashpower won't veto that attempt by voting against it.
This means that with BIP 100, the limit will only be possible to change with wide consensus, but without requiring the extreme level of consensus needed for a hard fork, which is a level that can only be reached through the community coalescing around a small number of influential 'leaders' that form what is effectively a centralized governing structure (e.g. the five Core committers, Gavin Andresen, etc).
In other words, making 80% of the hashpower the level needed for a change in the max block size hits the 'sweet spot' for how much consensus is needed.
BIP 100 acknowledges that we do not know what the optimum block size limit is. It keeps our options open, and allows us to fine tune the limit to the best information at hand at the time. The BIP can and should be tweaked (to remove the 32 MB limit, and to mitigate the risks of a 21% attack), but IMHO, a proposal along its lines is the right direction to go in. It's fixing a more fundamental problem than choosing the right block size limit: it provides us with a practical way to arrive at a consensus on what the right limit is, and to implement that limit in all full node clients.
@_date: 2015-09-05 01:24:49
AFAIK, no. The problem is that an adversary that wants other miners to download their block slowly can select txs that are not already in other miner's mempools, thus canceling out the benefits of this compression scheme.

There is a very high likelihood that creating more economies of scale won't significantly increase mining centralization, and that even if it does, won't result in Bitcoin's level of decentralization falling to below the level needed to remain censorship resistant, where it has to compete with centralized payment processors like PayPal and Visa.
Claiming Bitcoin will become centralized with any straightforward O(N) scaling solution is fearmongering IMO. There are risks with any solution, and the risk of stagnation, which contains within it the potential for a significant opportunity cost loss, as well as lower resistance to political attack, is totally ignored by analyses like yours.

Nothing will change in terms of knowing the future. There will always be new technologies on the horizon that can change the decentralization landscape. Five years ago it was pruning, pooled mining and ASICs. Right now it's SCs and the LN. In the future it's something else.

While hashpower gives Bitcoin an advantage, there are altcoins that have enough security, or at least perceived to, to conceivably take market share from Bitcoin as a store of wealth, if Bitcoin loses the perception that it is poised to be a major transactional currency. 
That you ignore this is foolhardy and dangerous for Bitcoin.

I'm saying that increasing orphan rates at a given block size reduces the risk that we'll see large blocks, but increases the centralization risk that those large blocks pose.

I'll grant that this is a weakness of this proposal, but it's not that bad for the following reasons: 
1. they can't decrease it to less than 1 MB,  
2. this contradicts the OP's concern that the proposal "would be terrible for nodes where your bandwidth needed could double at almost anytime" - if the bottom 20% of votes sets the limit, it makes it a very conservative proposal that reduces the danger of runaway limit growth, and 
3. if a serious attack is ever launched (for instance, a malicious party with 20% of the hashrate voting to reduce the  limit from 32 MB to 1 MB, despite block space supply already being tight), the mining majority does always have the power to orphan the 20%'s blocks. Not an ideal solution obviously, and not an easy one to implement, but still does act as an insurance policy against the 21% attack.
In any case, BIP 100 can be modified to mitigate the risks of a 21% attack. My personal proposal would put a steadily increasing lower (and upper) bound on the max block size, so that the most a malicious party with 20% of the hashrate could do is freeze the limit's growth rate to 10% per year:


You don't need to single-handedly find a block to influence the block size limit. Having any amount of hashing power means having influence on the limit, as you determine which pool, and by extension, which limit vote, your hashing power supports.


The most influential parties in the mining economy have long-term investments in Bitcoin that out-live a single generation of mining ASICs. For example, they have invested in their pool's brand, operational processes, warehouses, etc. And even ASICs last long enough where a 1 week spike in profits that is followed by a crash in bitcoin value from a loss in confidence in the network would be unprofitable for anyone who owns them.

1. Privacy enhancements like merge avoidance increase space usage, so on their own, will need larger blocks.

I didn't say that. I said 101 is more susceptible to human fallibility, because fallibility increases the further in the future you are making a prediction about.


No, I only expect that if 80% of the hashrate agrees with something, then it is in the interest of the community. I find it hard to believe that 20% of the hashrate wouldn't veto a proposed limit increase that's harmful to the Bitcoin economy.

It's an unfair and shaky extrapolation in my opinion. Hearn never said Bitcoin clients should allow users to red list. Giving arguments for something is not tantamount to declaring support for it. Hearn never even came close to proposing this, as he saw widespread opposition to it from the general community. It had nothing to do with Core.
You've allowed the anti-Hearn gossipers to make you believe in things that are not true about him. Hearn's dissatisfaction with Core stems from disagreement over the block size limit, and I believe, deficient regard for zero-conf and SPV client support.

It is very much the case. The very first descriptions of Bitcoin, by Satoshi Nakamoto, explained that Bitcoin could scale to compete with Visa in transaction volumes. There is ample textual evidence that the vast majority of Bitcoin investors and users have always pinned their hopes on Bitcoin becoming a major transactional currency.


This is absolutely foolish rubbish. Without mainstream adoption, there is no hope of that happening. That you have overly confident fantasies about billionaires and major financial institutions investing significant sums of capital into a barely traded, easily cloned digital currency, that cannot scale to allow any other significant uses, doesn't mean Bitcoin needs to hobble itself to accommodate you.
Your sense of judgment, or your concern for Bitcoin's success, is so low, that even when a major financial institution, which is one of the parties that you are pinning your hopes on making Bitcoin a "high value settlement network", forgoes a Bitcoin project due to the limit, you maintain that the limit's effect on adoption should be totally ignored.

Security and decentralization are of paramount importance, but they are not the only concerns that should factor into discussions on scaling. All major concerns should factor into the discussion, including adoption and the effects of the limit on it. Furthermore, adoption can also boost security and decentralization by increasing mining revenue and the number of individuals with an economic incentive to audit the blockchain, that is, run a full node.

BIP 100 can be modified to prevent rapid increases or decreases in the max block size value. The advantage of BIP 100 is that we can adjust the max block size to conditions that exist at the time. 
If for instance we see a huge spike in demand, and major optimizations of the full node implementation are done that enable it to more easily handle larger blocks, we can more quickly increase the limit. 
If instead we see that broadband growth is stagnating, we can slow it down. Or we might see broadband grow fast, but demand for tx space stay flat, in which we might want to keep the limit where it is to maintain fee pressure and discourage spam from entering the blockchain.

Unless the plan is to do a can-kick, 2-4-8 type increase every few years, which means this whole debate will hang over the Bitcoin economy forever, and market players won't be able to make long term plans around Bitcoin, since the protocol's scalability qualities will be in flux.

To clarify, in case you're misunderstanding my proposal, I'm suggesting miners vote via hashrate, and the majority supported value (e.g. the median value of all voted values) becomes the network defined value of bitcoin in relation to bandwidth.

A user creates a unique signed UTXO_set for every single privkey with which they want to sign Bitcoin txs. A signed UTXO_set is a hash tree where every leaf is signed by the same privkey.
The user stores the nodes further up the tree, to use for proof construction, and discards the rest to save storage space.
 
When a user creates a transaction, they attach to it a truncated merkle root of the UTXO_set signed with the privkey that corresponds to the one used to sign the transaction.
Once the transaction is confirmed, the block hash of the block in which it is confirmed, as well as the transaction ID, are used as inputs for a function that generates a random number, R, that is used to select a UTXO from the UTXO_set. 
In a subsequent block, the user must present a merkle branch linking the UTXO selected by R, signed with the same privkey used to sign the transaction, to the previously presented merkle root that was attached to that transaction.
You know that the proof was generated locally because it required the user's private key to generate, and users are not going to trust third parties with a copy of their private key.

Do you have a source for the Fidelity stuff only being timestamping of information? That would require a single hash per block, which doesn't jive with them putting off the project due to the limit.
Do you not see any value in the Bitcoin platform being used by more parties? You don't think there are indirect benefits from the IT teams of major financial institutions becoming more familiar with the platform, and growing accustomed to developing on top of it? You don't think the tools they build for one project to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain would increase the probability that they would embark on new Bitcoin-related projects in the future?

When fees decrease, transaction volumes will increase, when all other things are held equal.

That's not a "proof". No where in that paragraph does the word proof, or any of its aliases, appear. It's clear that Satoshi was saying SPV users could download the full block in which the alleged fake tx appears, if they get alerts from other nodes that a 51% attacker is generating fake txs.

1000 times greater volume would be 400 MB blocks.

I didn't claim transactions are the only measure of adoption. You're making a straw man argument. If you continue to misrepresent me, then it will be exceedingly difficult to have a constructive discussion.
The volume of transactions is certainly a major measure of adoption, and no reasonable person would disagree with that. When a major company decides to not proceed with a Bitcoin project, that will certainly have a negative effect on adoption.


The majority are sitting in cold wallets because they speculate the demand for BTC for transactional uses will scale. The very first descriptions of Bitcoin, by Satoshi Nakamoto, explained that Bitcoin could scale to compete with Visa in transaction volumes. Bitcoin investors and users have always pinned their hopes on Bitcoin becoming a major transactional currency. 
You claim that the very rich and major financial institutions adopting Bitcoin will turn into a high-powered money without any consumer adoption. Then when a major financial institution puts off a Bitcoin project because of the limit, you claim this should factor into the discussion at all.
Your statement that:

The important takeaway of his point is that the limit is having unseen effects on adoption and the ecosystem. Blocks don't have to be full, and a resultant fee rise doesn't need to happen, for adoption to be stunted by the limit. Just the knowledge that the limit will cap the volume of transactions is enough to affect investor and business sentiment, as in the case of the Fidelity. 
One can acknowledge that the limit is having unseen inhibitive effects on adoption and ecosystem buy-in, and still support the limit, but it's important that it factors into the discussion regardless.

As for what Hearn's views on redlisting are now, I really don't care what they are as long as he's not advocating them. I will advocate for privacy enhancements in Bitcoin any chance I get.

@_date: 2015-04-14 03:46:42


It'll go further than that if broadband connection speeds continue to increase. If by 2035, blocks are 16 GB, that's enough to exceed Visa's transaction volumes. Larger blocks can also act as a stopgap solution to allow Bitcoin adoption to continue until better scaling solutions are deployed.


99.99% of the world population does. And alt-chains would have nearly all of the advantages of Bitcoin without the artificial cap on limits. Users aren't going to care that the altchain's nodes require more bandwidth due to larger blocks, because most users are going to use light clients anyway.

Your initial statement treats them as identical:


You make no distinction between different magnitudes of increase in the economies of scale. You state categorically that increases in economies of scale will turn Bitcoin into a centralized currency. The lack of nuance makes it over-simplistic and inaccurate.
Increasing centralization does no harm until Bitcoin's decentralization drops to a level where it loses its censorship resistance. Censorship resistance is very much a binary state. As long as Bitcoin has it, it is trustless, or 'trust minimized', and will have a distinct value proposition and utility from centralized payment processors like PayPal and Visa. 
Therefore, if it's entirely possible for Bitcoin's transaction throughput to increase, and for it to not become a "centralized currency" that "will be competing with centralized currencies which Bitcoin does not have the first mover advantage for". Again, it depends on how much the throughput is increased. In other words, increasing scale would not categorically turn it into a centralized currency, as your first comment suggested.

The human involvement in BIP 101 is in perpetuity as well. That original human decision will affect BIP 101 for ever. Just because it's a single decision, that affects Bitcoin for all time, rather than many decisions, that affect Bitcoin for all time, doesn't lessen its effect on Bitcoin. In fact, it is more susceptible to human fallibility, because it counts more greatly on human predictive powers, in knowing what the right growth in the max block size is decades from now.


I've already [suggested](
 BIP 100 be modified to prevent such attacks. So I agree that it is wanting in this respect.


Similarly, if the 21% are keeping the max block size at too low a value, miners can soft fork to prevent any further decreases in the limit.
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:24:32
The attack vector is a &gt;80% attack that bloats the blockchain. Bitcoin is already vulnerable to complete destruction through a &gt;50% attack that can invalidate the network's core security assumption: that a transaction confirmed by N number of blocks is irreversible. Therefore the attack vector adds practically no risk to the system, since a hostile majority could much more easily destroy Bitcoin through existing vectors.
Now any new block size limit policy comes with risk. It's an unknown after all, and there's no way to know how it will turn out until it's used in a real world system. However, consider the alternatives:
* Do no hard fork, keep the 1 MB limit forever: on the one side, significant risk of Bitcoin stagnation leading to its obsolescence, as less restricted blockchains supplant it, or legislatures turn the Bitcoin usage into a licensed activity, before widespread public buy-in can make such political attacks infeasible. On the other, massive risk of a faction within Bitcoin proceeding with a contentious hard fork that leads to the network fragmenting. **Risks**: obsolescence, fragmentation
* Do frequent, small hard forks: Many have argued they would be easy and risky free, but we've never tried a hard fork that changes the block size limit. Even small can-kick hard forks could turn out to be extremely contentious as reaching an agreement on the exact timing of such hard forks, and extent by which they increase the limit, could  be elusive. One of these hard forks could end up leading to the network fragmenting. **Risks**: fragmentation
* A pre-defined exponential increase in the limit: we don't know the future, yet such a solution would attempt to predict how fast bandwidth and demand will grow decades into the future. If the prediction is wrong, we could be stuck with a limit that is too low, which entails a massive opportunity cost, or worse, a subsequent contentious hard fork, or too high, which contributes to a dangerous increase in centralization. **Risks**: long term stifling of Bitcoin growth, fragmentation, centralization
So yes, there is risk in Bitcoin's future, with BIP 100 or any other proposal. I would argue that formalizing the process by which the max block size is changed, by incorporating it into the consensus rules, to vastly decrease the risk of needing to do a future hard fork to change the block size limit, is the most conservative option available.

There's no reason to assume that a censorship resistant LN will not have frequent channel renewals. The more reliable and stable the channels, the more likely they are highly trusted, and thus will become targets for censorship. So we should assume a network with a dynamic topography and ever-changing edges. We should be conservative about our projections on this, right?
In any case, even we use an extremely optimistic projection on channel stability and reliability, like one renewal a year, and one channel per user, most of the world's poor won't be able to use the LN. Is that what Bitcoin is supposed to be: a network out of reach for those who most need it?


It doesn't matter who sets it up. An employer paying someone, say, $2 a day, is not going to spend $20 setting up a LN channel for them. That's like a company spending $1,500 a year in transaction fees to pay someone a salary of $36K a year. The employee would prefer the employer give them cash, and give the $20 as wages.

In the comments you cite, he suggests it will be easy to raise the limit, when he says "it can be phased in, like..  I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade".
In order to maintain your view, you have to ignore ALL OF THE CONTEXT, including all of the statements Satoshi made on how the network would consolidate into a small number of large nodes run by professionals, and allow thousands of transactions to be processed per second, and instead read into what you assume he took away from OTHER poster's comments, in order to extrapolate a plan in Satoshi's mind that contradicts almost everything he's said on how Bitcoin would scale.
A much more reasonable explanation for Satoshi's actions and statements is that he meant exactly what he said, and that his dismissal of comments warning about the difficulty to raise the limit was due to his belief that it would be easy to raise the limit, just as he said. Instead of assuming that everything he said was a lie, let's assume he was being forthright.

You don't suffer from anyone's ideological beliefs. They either pay you or they don't. If the tx isn't confirmed, for whatever reason, then they didn't pay you. Why they decided to craft their transaction in a manner that it doesn't get confirmed is none of your concern. Your concern is simply getting your money, which they are responsible for, irrespective of their views on the max block size.
As for fungibility, once its confirmed in a block, it's spendable by you, regardless of what 'max block size' was attached to the tx initially. So it has no effect on fungibility. 
Finally, expressing your view on the max block size is not an expression of "ideology". It's an expression of your valuation of decentralization, and an attempt to influence the max block size based on that valuation.

The minimally allowed max block size value of a given block is 1.61051 (10 percent annual growth for five years) times B, for 30 years.
The maximally allowed max block size value of a given block is 5.37824 (40 percent annual growth for five years) times B, for 30 years.

Until recently, the expectation was that Bitcoin's transaction throughput could be ramped up with demand. The expectation fed the speculative demand for BTC. Your argument totally misses this dimension.


False. An electronic cash system deals with both low and high value transfers, and is not a low velocity high-value settlement network like the SWIFT-mediated international banking correspondence system.
All of the literature, including Satoshi's writings, about scaling, from Bitcoin's creation in early 2009, to 2014,  talked about Bitcoin's transaction volumes increasing to thousands of tps. That was the expectation, no matter how much you try to rewrite history.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:54:20


From what I can see, the trend is toward local storage of private keys, because of the counter party risk of storing with a third party. Blockchain.i for example doesn't store your private key, so wouldn't be able to generate these 'proofs of local storage' for you.
Even if in the future, more people do use TTP wallets, the most financially efficient way to do TTP wallet txs is to aggregate on-chain txs, to reduce tx fees. This would give TTP wallet txs the distinction of having larger values on average, and this distinction can in turn be used by a full node decentralisation gauging scheme to distinguish txs that contribute to a decentralisation metric from those that don't.
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:15:06


$20 tx fees would mean Bitcoin failing in its mission. It would be a bank coin only economically usable by banks and the rich, since only transactions &gt;$1,000 would be economical to make.
As for indefinite growth of the IBD, that can be solved with UTXO commits acting as checkpoints. Eventually Bitcoin will have to transition to limiting validation to a constant sized segment of the full block chain history, with or without scaling.

We can modify my statement and it wouldn't change my central point. Whatever the set of harmful effects of centralization are (reverse transactions, tx censorship, etc.), they don't start to manifest until we reach a certain level of centralization. 
Your initial comment that increasing economies of scale would categorically turn Bitcoin into a "centralized currency" that will be "will be competing with centralized currencies" is inaccurate. It's possible that Bitcoin would remain a decentralized trustless currency with increased economies of scale, and it depends on several factors, the most important of which is by how much the economies of scale is increased by.

Again, this is simply false. There are direct statements on the subject of how Bitcoin would scale to allow even microtransactions to be on the blockchain, and how this would be achieved by the network consolidating into larger nodes run by professionals. It doesn't get clearer than that, and you are in serious denial in dismissing the significance of Satoshi's statements on the subject, in favour of a purely conjectural theory that has to assume Satoshi was lying to numerous people for it to make any sense.


It's a very entertaining theory, but it's not one that we should seriously consider. It's conspiratorial, based on subjective conjecture, and assumes extreme deceit on the part of Satoshi. The most likely and most reasonable assumption is that Satoshi was not a liar, and there was no elaborate scheme to manipulate the community. Conjecture about Satoshi lying and having an agenda in direct contravention to his stated plans for Bitcoin has no credibility in scalability discussions.

Bitcoin's success is totally and utterly dependent on "herds of consumers adopting it".

Of course users can do that, but why would you trust a third party with your private key, if they are not providing you with any of the benefits that a TTP can provide a user? The only significant benefit of using a BTC wallet hosted by a TTP is that they can aggregate on-chain payments, thus saving you on tx fees. When they aggregate on-chain payments, and create a fewer number of larger value transactions, the EBDD described in the proposal decreases significantly relative to the volume of BTC transacted, thus reducing the relevance of TTP txs to the sum EBDD value.


That wouldn't work. You need to sign every leaf, meaning you need to have nearly the entire UTXO set. The only way, or I should say the most efficient way to do that, while retaining exclusive knowledge of a private key is to have the UTXO set stored locally.
@_date: 2015-09-03 03:35:10
Perpetually storing everything will eventually make it impossible for full nodes to be deployed in a decentralized fashion. The problem with the UTXO specifically is that it continues to grow over time because some percentage of transactions are unspendable by design (e.g. recording messages in the blockchain with small value txs) and simply accumulate.

That's absolutely wrong. Speculation of future increases of transaction throughput has been a critical component of the speculative demand for BTC. The Bitcoin white paper calls Bitcoin a peer-to-peer electronic cash, not a low-velocity high value settlement network.

Sidechains have a different problem: they're not as secure as main chain transactions. If only large value transactions can go on the main chain, and everything else is on sidechains, that means only rich people and banks can afford secure transactions. I think it's better if everyone is able to have secure transactions.
Sidechains are also only theory at this point. There's no telling if they will be useful.
As for this:


If it's expensive to make an on-chain transactions, then people will be forced to stay with their wallet provider. They won't be free to use their own wallet or to easily switch a different third-party-controlled wallet. A small block size means $20-30 transaction fees for on-chain transactions, meaning depositing your money with a third party wallet is a long-term commitment.

First, there will be no digital gold if there is no credible scarcity and no significant demand, all of which comes from a large network effect and extensive economic activity on the network.
Second, if someone wants a low velocity digital gold, with $20 fees for on-chain txs, and trusted third parties acting as intermediaries between the masses and the blockchain, they're free to create a perma-capped altcoin, or get consensus from the Bitcoin community to change the vision for Bitcoin.

BIP 100 requires 80 percent of hashrate to support a change, which is very very unlikely to happen without widespread consensus for the change.

Naturally, Bitcoin's network effect could be so great that the vast majority of people would prefer to use Bitcoin off-chain over altcoin on-chain. However, there will always be edge cases where on-altchain is preferable to the user to off-blockchain. In short, Bitcoin's competitive advantage over altchains, regardless of how great it is, is reduced when access to on-chain transactions is reduced, and this competitive advantage is the only thing separating Bitcoin from an infinite number of clones. This contrasts with gold which has an inherent competitive advantage due to its unique scarcity.
In other words, you're over-simplifying, in cleanly dividing payment and settlement functionality, when in reality, there is significant overlap, for example in the boost that the network being utilized for payments gives to its function as a settlement network (e.g. more transaction fees paid on payment txs = increases in network hashrate = more security and trust in the settlement network).

At least mining centralizing pressures are minimized by IBLT when miners are behaving honestly. That seems to be the biggest concern expressed over larger blocks, so it would be good development for network health and scalability if that was solved. 


1. You have not demonstrated that this is "accepted theory". 
2. You have not shown that "all observed evidence" indicates that larger blocks would lead to "reverse transactions, mint infinite coins, destroy the currency". In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite, since these things have never/seldom happened. The dire outcome you predict is simply speculation from you, based on the trends you see in the links.

This is the kind of poor judgment, or perhaps malicious intent, that I fear is influencing the anti-large-block side of the debate. Venture capitalists are the people who fund the development of a market infrastructure.

I just can't understand the myopia that leads one to shun venture capital investments in the Bitcoin space.
@_date: 2015-11-11 11:09:29


Yes it does. You can't move the BTC on the blockchain with your own private keys if you can't afford to pay the transaction fee. Blockchain space scarcity is the equivalent of making blockchain access scarce, and whittling down the private keys with access to on-chain value to large intermediaries.
This is what the **Lightning Network creators** say too. They say that a too-low block size limit would result in a world where people don't have personal access to the money on the chain:
The Lightning Network creators provided a good analogy of the block size limit spectrum being a bathtub with two failure outcomes on either side, and a large success area in the middle.


That's an egregious lie and suggests you're participating in these discussions in bad faith.
BIP 101 means 8 GB blocks will be possible in 2035.
8 GB blocks with 400 million users in 2035 doesn't equal a censored network and "no one but a few cabal on state-sponsored institutions will get to actually verify the state of the blockchain". Storage and bandwidth will be much cheaper by that time, and hundreds of millions of users means far more people with an economic incentive to audit the blockchain (run a full node). Combined with the globally distributed nature of the network, it makes censorship extremely unlikely.
You're actually making the inflammatory claim that 8 GB blocks in 2035 would mean:


When even right now, there are numerous people that could process and propagate 8 GB of transaction data with their home internet connection every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-11-11 20:17:45

It will never get to $20 with a 1 MB limit. The network effect will never get large enough with such a low throughput for fees to be able to rise to that level before an alternative blockchain becomes more attractive due to lower fees.
If the limit was, say, 8 GB, and tens of thousands of txs were being processed on it per second, and it became the main medium of value transfer in the world, at that point, it's conceivable that fees could start rising to very high levels as throughput came up against protocol limits, without any alternative blockchain posing any competitive threat to Bitcoin, on account of the latter's massive network effect.

I agree with Gavin Andresen's opinion on Patrick Strateman's presentation:






There are solutions like UTXO commits acting as decentralized checkpoints to obviate the need for validating ancient transaction history. Bitcoin Core is already using developer-set checkpoints to allow users to skip signature validation on older blocks. UTXO commits would be a step up from that in terms of trustlessness.

How much better, and how fast will it get there? Say half of the world's population can't use it by that the time LN hits the mainstream? And what if you need 10 direct connections to use the LN without risk of censorship? In that case, more than 95% of the world's population won't be able to use it.

First of all, can you stop downvoting me? It shows bad faith. We're having a discussion, not a fight.
Second, I am not misunderstanding anything. Simply put, a small group of people controlling an aspect of the protocol makes the protocol centralized.
The claims you're making do not refute any of that. You are simply ignoring the centralization of it. You even support the idea of an "elite faction" controlling a key aspect of the protocol. Centralization contradicts the principle of decentralization that underpins Bitcoin, no matter how enlightened you may think it is.


I disagree. I think larger blocks are more conducive to fostering anonymity, sovereignty, fungibility and stability.
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:48:26




Yes, it is possible that the adoption rate could actually accelerate despite the rising fees, because of the strengthening network effect. But all things (e.g. the network effect) being equal, higher fees mean slower adoption, so whatever the possibility is of mass adoption occurring, it is lower with more scarce block space (a lower limit). 
Eventually, the block size needs to be capped, even if it harms adoption, in order to preserve the loss of decentralization, but there's no need to cap the limit at 1 MB, given this is far below what the network can sustain and still preserve its permissionless-ness. Furthermore, I strongly doubt that the network effect at 1 MB limit would be enough to sustain adoption as fees rise to significant (e.g. above $0.25) levels. Scarcity should be imposed only after the network has a very substantial network effect with tens of millions of users. Right now is far too early.
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:55:06
Hard forks are perfect opportunities for opponents of the technology divide and conquer the community. I would rather one hard fork to deal with it forever, than leave the network dependent on another risky hard fork in a few years. Nothing will change over the years: a hard fork on the block size limit will always remain just as controversial as it is now, if not more controversial due to the community being larger and more ideologically diverse. 
If the BIP 101 limit ends up being too high, the community will always reserve the right to create a soft fork that restrains block size growth. But we won't have to worry about another hard fork to increase the limit, where I think the real risk is.
I think there are better options out there than BIP 101, but I think BIP 101 is much better than the status quo, and if consensus was formed around it, I would happy to go along with it.

Semi-trusted would be a node operated by a party you know to be committed to the principles that Bitcoin is built on. Now one semi-trusted node might trick you and convince you they care about Bitcoin, and actually be part of an evil cabal of nodes looking to raise the coin limit above 21 million, but 10 geographically distributed semi-trusted nodes? Or 50? I find that highly unlikely. There's no limit to how many nodes you can query for tx data. Only if they ALL collude, along with &gt;50% of the network hashrate, could you be defrauded.
This seems to be much less risky than forcing most transactions to be done on permissioned ledgers, where the ledgers' preassigned principals have the ability to rob you if M of N of them collude, and no way for you to increase N or change its composition of parties after you have deposited your BTC with the permissioned ledger.

Demand from speculators can evaporate overnight which means it's dangerous to pin the hopes of a digital asset on being solely a "digital gold" without non-speculative demand as a transactional currency supporting its value.
If a digital asset is going to have stable value, it needs a non-volatile source of demand. In the case of BTC, the obvious potential source of this demand is from people looking to make use of it for transactional purposes. The advice being given by the likes of who claims that BTC losing its potential to be a transactional currency for use by consumers is not a bad thing, and even saying that if Microsoft stops accepting BTC, it would do no harm to the currency's long term viability as a store of wealth,  and who constantly agitates against efforts to build consensus to raise the block size limit, is extremely misguided at best, and malicious at worst.

How can infinity people use a channel without relying on a trusted third party? To trustlessly use the LN, they need a channel between themselves a LN node, which requires an on-chain tx to set up.

The developing world should rely on the node operators in the developed world for transaction validation. This is not unduly risky because the blockchain is public data. It would be extremely difficult to give users fraudulent data and have them believe it's authentic, since they can cross-reference the data with any number of semi-trusted sources all around the world.
The important thing for developing world access to the blockchain is that transaction fees be low enough, meaning block space be abundant enough, that people in the developing world do not need to use an intermediary to store and transfer their BTC on their behalf. The key is that they control their BTC with their own private key.

Another throwaway account No, I'm perfectly understanding what Bitcoin is:
    Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
    Satoshi Nakamoto
    satoshin
    
    Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. 
Note: **"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"**
As if that isn't clear enough, Satoshi emphasized the cost of transfer and the ability to do "small casual transactions" with Bitcoin even more further down the white paper:
    Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. 
And in the announcement mailing list, said Bitcoin could handle thousands of transactions per second on the blockchain:
    The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
    If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. 
You've seen these quotes before yet willfully misrepresent what Bitcoin is.

As for SCs and LNs making txs cheap, my response is to the OP claiming that $20 is not much less than $45, not potential cost savings if these proposals are implemented and turn out to be practical, which is not the topic of this discussion.

How could 8 GB block/10-minutes impose such steep node operating costs where nothing below a "large corporation" could run a node, especially in 2035?

Of course I will.. You're implying that SPV clients and web-wallet users can't choose their network, which is not true.
Here's a simple solution off the top of my head:
I run an SPV client that connects to half a dozen semi-trusted full nodes that comply with the non-censored network rules. If all the nodes are giving me the same data, then I have a high level of assurance that I'm getting correct data.

All infringements of freedom are justified by the preventative effect they have against crime. Crime prevention doesn't justify infringing on innocent people's liberties and privacy.


I'm referring to the similarity in banning unrestricted private activity in the name of crime prevention. I wasn't making a direct analogy between live-streaming and KYC laws.


No, it would be akin to being required to do KYC on anyone connecting to your public WiFi or using your email hosting service, so that you can report them to the authorities if they visit a child pornography site, or email child pornography. It's deputizing private citizens and requiring them to police each other as a condition for escaping the ban on the activity.

I think you're being deliberately difficult. You knew exactly what I meant by the threshold being 4,000 txs per second, yet you brought up layer 2 txs.
And now claiming I'm assuming the solution when you know that's not what I mean..
But let me rephrase: if a limit is implemented that would allow that throughput within that time frame, I would define it as a limit that allows mass-adoption-level usage. The throughput does not actually need to reach the threshold for the bet to be triggered, only implementation of a limit that makes such a throughput possible.

Yes adoption will slow as fees rise. 


Because adoption slowing doesn't mean adoption has stopped. Any adoption, even slow adoption, increases blockchain usage, which increases fee pressure. Fees rise more slowly as adoption slows, until it finally reaches an equilibrium of zero fee increase and zero adoption.

You frequently make blanket characterizations of venture capital and the role it plays in the Bitcoin space that will lead to people taking a negative view of it.
Just one example:
    What are the risks of not scaling fast enough? We won't get a bunch of Vulture Capatalists putting their parasitic additions onto the blockchain giving no value to Bitcoin, but having us secure it for them?


With a 1 MB limit, it's very unlikely it will achieve mass adoption. With a limit that is dynamic and permits mass-adoption usage levels, it is likely. I can't wager the likelihood of the latter happening, so I won't take that bet, but I'm willing to bet that if a scalable limit is implemented, Bitcoin will achieve mass adoption within 4 years of the limit coming into effect.
As for what classifies as "mass adoption", we can agree on some numbers. It's not exactly a formal term that denotes a specific number.

@_date: 2015-11-16 09:19:36


I'm not saying SPV nodes should trust the majority hashrate. I'm saying they should trust semi-trusted full nodes.


It means the former. Scarcity of blockchain access translates to fewer people controlling funds on the blockchain with private keys that they have exclusive access to. It's true that under any block size limit, rich people can drive the price up to the point that poor people can't use it, but it gets more expensive as the block size limit gets higher, so all things being equal, a higher limit means more people can access the blockchain.


I'm saying that between trusting any number of nodes to not all lie to you about public blockchain data (large block scenario), and a select number of trusted nodes to not steal/censor your money with your private data (small block scenario), it's much safer to do the former.
More block space = more independent control of value on ledger.
Less block space = more independent validation of ledger.
Given the latter can be substituted with polling any number of independent semi-trusted parties all around the world, while the former is impossible to do securely without being able to do it independently, it makes more sense to err on the side of more block space.


Writing code is extremely important, so I give you that, but making substantial investments into the Bitcoin economy, as major Bitcoin companies and their shareholders have done, is also important. Holding a substantial number of coins is also important. In other words, Core contributors are not the only stakeholders whose viewpoints should be considered.

If there's no global attack, there will be many nodes *somewhere* in the world run by everyday people, ensuring validation is being widely done and keeping the blockchain honest.


BIP 101 means 8 GB blocks will be possible in 2035.
8 GB blocks with 400 million users in 2035 doesn't equal a censored network and "restrict[ing] governance of Bitcoin to a handful of vulnerable and easily targeted datacenters around the world". Storage and bandwidth will be much cheaper by that time, and hundreds of millions of users means far more people with an economic incentive to audit the blockchain (run a full node). Combined with the globally distributed nature of the network, it makes censorship extremely unlikely.
You're actually making the inflammatory claim that 8 GB blocks in 2035 would mean:


When even right now, there are numerous people that could process and propagate 8 GB of transaction data with their home internet connection every 10 minutes. The idea that 8 GB blocks would restrict full nodes to "datacenters" in 2035 is crazy.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:41:46
Or investors got spooked by the fact that Bitcoin governance seemed to be failing with the divide between Core and XT. 
The evidence does not support the notion that investors perceive larger blocks as a threat to Bitcoin's decentralisation. Evidence against the notion is that **almost every major Bitcoin company, which are the entities with the largest material investment in the Bitcoin economy, supports BIP 101**. No one knows what is behind the price increase. One can only speculate. I suspect the Scaling Bitcoin conference, as well as the work done by Blockstream to create Liquid, played a role in it.

It's not the way it is. Gavin believes that specialization does not threaten decentralization. Hashing is no longer done by regular nodes, yet the distribution of hashers is highly distributed and not susceptible to censorship. There's a difference between specialization and institutionalization. An institution-run Bitcoin would obviously be highly centralized by governments through the censorship of said-institutions.

He has contributed more to Bitcoin's success than almost anyone. Several Android wallets and Multibit use the SPV library he created. The reason he is so relentlessly attacked is because he advocates for mass adoption, which the most active agitators against raising the block size limit explicitly say is not possible for Bitcoin in the next 4-5 years:
These are the same people trying to turn the Bitcoin community against venture capital funding, and who call BTC investors "bagholders". They are making a future where people use digital currency less likely, by stalling mass adoption, and giving government functionaries [more time to ban its use]( before public buy-in makes that impossible.

Validation using up 25% of a home PC's computing resources does not warrant the sensationalist claims about needing a data center to process 1 GB blocks.

@_date: 2015-11-11 11:28:05




I agree with Gavin Andresen's opinion on Patrick Strateman's presentation:






There are solutions like UTXO commits acting as decentralized checkpoints to obviate the need for validating ancient transaction history. Bitcoin Core is already using developer-set checkpoints to allow users to skip signature validation on older blocks. UTXO commits would be a step up from that in terms of trustlessness.


There are people that could propagate that amount of data every 10 minutes. 10 minutes is 600 seconds. A lot of time to download/upload 16 GB of data. There are a lot of people with very fast internet connections. In 2035, it will be lightyears better than now in that respect.
@_date: 2015-11-11 16:03:49


No they are not harmful. The typical node that has 8 or fewer connections is harmful because it does not accept incoming connections, not because it has 8 or fewer connections. Having 1 to 8 connections, while accepting incoming connections, does not harm the network, and assists in propagation.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:00:35

Come to think of it, a fake full node could limit their downloads to only those txs requested by SPV clients, so they wouldn't have as steep of a bandwidth bill as a full node. However, they would be slower in responding to SPV clients, since they wouldn't have a copy of the tx stored locally, and that would give them a competitive disadvantage.


I'm not following you. If SPV clients aren't paying a fake full node, that means the fake full node is not successfully competing against full nodes.

We have to use guesswork. We're either making a guess on what future broadband deployment will allow, or we're making a guess about the ability of a larger community to do a hard fork without introducing major centralizing social institutions that can get corrupted. 
**There is no zero-risk option.** As much people don't like uncertainty, they have to accept that any block size limit solution, including keeping the limit at 1 MB, contains uncertainty. People have zeroed in on risk to full node deployment and mining decentralization posed by large blocks, and totally ignored all of the other risks that are exacerbated by not doing a hard fork that allows Bitcoin to scale without further social intervention via hard forks. I'd argue that social intervention to change the protocol is dangerous, and the probability that there will be a need for future social intervention like this should be minimized to the extent possible.

Yes. Better than the alternative. The alternative means increasing the risk that one of the following three things will happen:
* Bitcoin gets stuck with a low block size limit, because a hard fork proves to be impossible, because the size of the community prevents a strong consensus from forming. This in turn increases other risks* **.
* Bitcoin is destroyed because a hard fork is attempted and splits the network, because the size of the community prevents a strong consensus from forming
* The Bitcoin community becomes increasingly centralized in its social structure, as a 'solution' to the difficulty of obtaining wide consensus within a decentralized community.
*The risk of an altcoin taking market share from Bitcoin, and thus fragmenting the cryptocurrency market, and with it, two of the main appeals that cryptocurrency has now: credible scarcity and a clear standard
**The risk that mass adoption of cryptocurrency is put off for too long, and by the time it starts to happen, governments have had time to enact legislation to restrict its uses. Remember, a large part of the reason the internet is so free today, is that it obtained mass adoption before governments had time to create laws to restrict its use.

I don't see 2-4-8 as a solution to the long-term problem. It's really just a can kick. I don't see 2020 as being any more likely to give us the information we need to predict the correct long term block limit schedule than 2015. Sure we'll know how Lightning Network works, but there will be new developments in the interim, and we won't know how those will shape up in the years that follow. 
There will be people who will say: "we need to wait a few years to see how the CoinTeleport Network works once it's deployed before we make many kind of long term commitment on the block size limit". And we will be equally in the dark about future broadband growth, so that facet of planning will be just as uncertain.
And there are added risks. With 8 MB limit blocks, assuming the network will be four years more developed, and if blocks are full, 16 times more active than it is now, it will have a much larger community. A larger community might make it difficult to actually do another hard fork, meaning there will be a higher likelihood that we will be stuck at 2020 forever.
Or if we do manage to get consensus for another hard fork in 2020, it might only be possible to get one for a tiny bump, e.g. to 10 MB, and then Bitcoin will form some kind of hard fork committee, that does a small bump every few years.
This centralized process is necessary because hard forks rely on a significant degree of social centralization so that the wide consensus needed is attained, and this need for social centralization will only grow as the community grows, and more segments of the community are disconnected from other segments of the community. In this environment, major figures will appear that act as de facto leaders. 
If these major leaders are corrupted we'll be in trouble.
What all of this leads to is that the Bitcoin protocol will be less predictable, reliably scalable, and more prone to centralization, the longer we wait to deal with the hard limit permanently.


Two points:
First, I agree that we can't predict the rate of broadband growth with any reliable precision. We could look at the doubling as not an attempt to track broadband growth, but rather a way to get to the maximum size (2 GB) at a predictable and somewhat moderate pace. 2 GB is MUCH MUCH bigger than 1 MB (2,000X bigger to be exact), yet not so far from 1 MB as to be totally unthinkable today. In fact, there are home internet connections that can handle that load today. 
Google Fibre can more than handle 2 GB of upload/download every 10 minutes, today, and I think it's a very safe assumption that the percentage of the population that has Google Fibre calibre connections in 20 years will be much larger than today, meaning that it's virtually guaranteed that 2 GB blocks in 2036 will not place the network in a situation where there only the negligible percentage of the population can run a full node from home.
Second, I agree that ideally the limit would be based on blockchain info. In fact I made a proposal along those lines. But these are very theoretical solutions, that might never pan out, or might take a long time. For Bitcoin to maximize its chances of global mass adoption now in the near future, it needs to resolve the hard limit issue that hangs over it and harms its institutional buy-in through the Fidelity Effect. 
Keep in mind, we could implement a long-term solution, and then do another hard fork if another, better solution presents itself. But at least having a long-term solution in place means that if another hard fork ends up becoming infeasible, we'll still be okayish, because the blockchain will eventually have a 2 GB limit that should satisfy a huge amount of long-term needs, and not pose any risk of stifling growth until long after mass-adoption has been achieved.

It does matter though. A fork that doesn't have as many users as the parent will struggle due to a lower network effect. This is not theory. It's seen all over the economy. That's why a coordinated switch over by the bulk of the userbase is needed to make the fork successful, and social coordination on that large a scale is difficult.

Gavin's proposal gets to a 16 GB block size hard limit by 2035, giving Bitcoin the option of allowing 7 billion txs per day.
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:29:04
According to Gavin Andresen's calculations, an above average PC and above average connection can currently handle 5,000 txs per second, and if broadband connection speeds continue to follow Nielsen's Law and increase by 50% per year, by 2027, an above average PC and above average connection will be able to handle enough txs per second for every person in the world (7 billion people) to make five or six bitcoin transaction per day:
If we're more conservative with broadband connection speed growth projections, we could wait an additional decade and get to the same figure. One way or another, Bitcoin can eventually scale to allow every person to make several transactions on the chain every day.
And much sooner than that, other mechanisms can be used to allow every individual to make hundreds of zero-trust off-chain transactions per day, like the Lightning Network.

I'm not convinced at all that Satoshi was referencing fraud proofs. I believe that the reference to "the full block" in the white paper was a typo, and was meant to say "the full block chain", as it would not make sense that Satoshi would believe that a full block would tell a user that a tx is invalid where a merkle branch wouldn't. 
If it wasn't a typo, then Satoshi's view of the viability of the Simplified Payment Verification method didn't change even as his understanding of its security properties most likely did, given Satoshi was promoting a network dominated by lightweight clients well into 2010, by which time any notion of a single block proving that a tx is invalid, had it ever been held, would most likely have been dismissed. I believe by then the securities properties of the SPV method would have been thought about and analyzed more thoroughly, and Satoshi had been communicating with Hearn about his BitcoinJ implementation of it. I can't imagine why Satoshi would hold such an obviously wrong view on the SPV security model well into 2010.
For these reasons, I believe that there was never any belief that fraud proofs smaller than the entire blockchain could exist, nor any belief that the SPV method couldn't work and be relied upon by the majority of Bitcoin users without them.
Arguably, given the immense damage that could be done by a hostile attacker that momentarily acquires over 50% of the hashrate in a network where SPV is relied upon extensively, and given the increasing difficulty of downloading the entire blockchain in the event that a user is receiving alerts of a &gt;50% attack, it's necessary to implement better lightweight client solutions, like PoW UTXO-set commitments, if there is going to be widespread reliance on SPV as Bitcoin becomes a larger.

Now you understand why I support larger blocks and mass adoption sooner rather than later. Speed of change is the great advantage of technological innovation. Effecting change should be pursued as quickly as possible, not sat on and mulled, so that ground floor expectations on rights and freedoms can be set before controls, that would restrict this new avenue of human freedom, have time to be legislated into law. Rapid adoption is exactly why the internet is free now. I believe the lack of a clear consensus on raising the limit to levels needed for mass adoption is the last major obstacle in the way of mass adoption of peer-to-peer currency.

I agree. Though 1 MB blocks only allow 3 tps in practice.
On the one hand Bitcoin faces the risk of irrelevancy. A 2-4-8 (6, 12, 24 tx/sec) could consign it to that. On the other, it faces the risk of mining centralization and regulation. An unlimited block size limit could consign it to that.

Like I said, others will decide for themselves whether it was a blanket characterization of VC in the Bitcoin space or not.


Then we can use price to measure. I propose that if the price of Bitcoin is over $3,000, we qualify that as mass adoption having occurred. 


I propose that that we define it as a limit that will allow the network to reach a throughput of 4,000 or more transactions per second within 20 years of implementation, without requiring a subsequent hard fork. 


I'm suggesting a Bitcoin that is permissionless as it is now: where all transactions can eventually be confirmed, subject to their consumption of network resources and the fees they pay, with no consideration of black or white lists.

IMO, the best way to handle Bitcoin governance is to let each individual control their client's block size limit themselves - an idea first proposed by theymos several years ago - with the added use of a BIP-100-style mechanism for miners to express their block size limit preference to users (e.g. if 80% of last 12000 blocks support a particular change in the block size limit, display the supported change on the Bitcoin client GUI), to allow the community to coordinate hard forks without a third party intermediary:
@_date: 2015-11-14 23:58:17
Not with a 3 tps limit. It's irrelevant in the context of global trade and finance with a maximum throughput of that order of magnitude.

Thank you for reaching out to the community about this contentious issue.
I think Bitcoin's differentiating quality is that it is permissionless, which is a product of its distributed and highly reconfigurable governance structure.
I also think that stifling blockchain access in the name of preserving those qualities is a terrible bargain. It makes no sense at all, since it is blockchain access that allows people to take advantage of Bitcoin's permissionless-ness.
The debate on the block size limit reminds me of this:




@_date: 2015-11-11 20:32:45
Yes but if you don't accept incoming connection then you are only connecting to nodes that are already well connected and do not need more connections. That is why accepting incoming connections is essential for contributing to network propagation.

Yeah that's a good idea. Many would want to follow the miner vote by default. Looks like we have reached consensus.


Haven't thought about this.

This can be done by allowing RBF only for txs which have the same outputs as the first tx. No need to make double spends of 0-conf txs easier if this is the objective.

@_date: 2015-03-16 22:52:12
I'll try to explain with an example:
If 5 percent of the network hashrate does replace by fee, then a thief who tries to double spend a 0-conf spend that has propagated only has a 5 percent chance of succeeding, which reduces the range of circumstances in which attempting to do this is profitable. As the percentage of the network hashrate that allows txs to be replaced by fee increases, the use-cases for thieves to use replace-by-fee increases, and thus the total demand for it increases.
@_date: 2015-03-16 11:32:34
With replace-by-fee not used by most miners, it's trivially easy for wallet software to get fairly quick confirmation that a small-value spend is safe from a double spend, by verifying that the spend has an adequate fee, and measuring what percentage of the network the spend has propagated to without a conflicting double spend. So replace-by-fee being adopted by miners would definitely make 0-conf zero-trust spends (meaning txs with no trusted third party guarantor) less secure.

SWIFT is a communication network. It can be used for coordinating transfers of bitcoin directly between banks. But I agree with the gist of your comment.

The blocks possible with XT would not limit full nodes to data centers. 8 GB blocks would require 26.7 MB/s upload/download, which even today, can be done with a state-of-the-art home internet connection like Google Fibre, and those sizes will only be possible in 2035 if XT is implemented, when what's a state-of-the-art internet connection today will very likely be commonplace.

There is no justification for this belief.
First of all, most nodes not being run on home internet connections doesn't equate to most nodes being run by corporations. Many entities aside from corporations could run resource-intensive full nodes.
Second, most nodes being run by [insert type] institutions doesn't mean that institution type "controls" the network. As long as some percentage of full nodes are honest, the correct blockchain will be propagated, and censorship will be impossible. You can't control the network just by running the majority of its nodes. If that were possible, it would be trivial take over the network through a Sybil attack.

Yes it is a change to how a user opts into a hard fork. There would be an input field in the Bitcoin Core GUI that allows a user to set their own MAX_BLOCK_SIZE value. Any change in this value would be opting into a hard fork.

Financial institutions above a certain size in every country get regulated because they are easy targets for state capture, and there is significant incentive for states to control them.

Here comes more smoke and mirrors..


You're deliberately misconstruing what the current proposal is. Gavin's comment in 2011 was about scaling to **"millions of bitcoin transactions happening every second"**.
The current proposal is about scaling to 24 thousand transactions per second. As Gavin has explained, the current proposal would allow home computers to continue running full nodes.
That you have to find a quote from 2011, and falsely attribute it to the **current proposal**, shows that you are intentionally trying to mislead people about the current proposals to increase the block size limit.


Again, totally disingenuous description of Gavin's statements. Gavin agrees that we lose something, but you leave out that he argues the thing we lose is of negligible importance:






The truth is simply not enough for you to make a convincing case against the larger block proposals, so you are making things up, and trying to mislead people, in order to convince them. That suggests you're participating in this discussion forum with your throwaway accounts in bad faith.


The blatantly dishonest argument you continue to repeat is that BIP 101 would lead to "corporations" running "all the Bitcoin nodes". Now you're moving the goalposts and asking me to prove that 8 GB blocks will allow a "home desktop PC with an **ordinary** connection" to run a full node. 
This is a diversion, because 8 GB blocks don't need to be processed by home PCs with "ordinary" connections -  many people have "extraordinary" connections at their home that would be able to handle 8 GB blocks. This means your statement about "only" corporations being capable of running full nodes with 8 GB blocks is false, and your switch to talking about "ordinary connections" is an evasive maneuver to draw attention away from the exposing of your lie.

It's not inevitable at all. All it takes is for all the major pools to resist doing it for it to remain a difficult to double spend a 0-conf transaction that has propagated. Given they have a very large long-term stake in the Bitcoin network, there is a very good possibility they will do just that to maximize the utility of the network. 
So there is no good, and much harm, that can come from trying to destroy a method transacting that is working today without much loss at all.

Increased security means its attractiveness as a store of wealth and settlement money increases. It will undoubtedly apply positive pressure on price, whether or not that actually translates into a price increase.


The usage of the coins is a separate issue from the BTC that needs to be acquired to pay the fees for that usage. The acquisition of that BTC is going to increase buy pressure. Now granted, those BTC are going to spent (and thus transferred to miners who promptly sell) quickly, but even that relatively brief period of holding BTC is demand for BTC-time that otherwise would not exist.

The 'technology' that makes Bitcoin so useful is being a common international ledger that's not owned by anyone and accessible to all. They can't make a new network that is as useful as Bitcoin without simply recreating Bitcoin, in which case, it's more economical to just adopt Bitcoin now.

Bitcoin's network effect, security, and comparatively low-volatility will in some cases provide a large enough advantage over altcoins that an individual would prefer to use Bitcoin off-chain over altcoin on-chain. However, there will always be edge cases where on-altchain is preferable to the user to off-blockchain. 
The edge case space is inversely related to Bitcoin's network effect - shrinking in proportion to growth in the network effect. The smaller Bitcoin's network effect is before the block size limit begins excluding users, the less effectively it will be able to compete with alternative blockchains. In short, Bitcoin's competitive advantage over altchains, regardless of how great it is, is reduced when access to on-chain transactions is reduced, and this hit is more risky to its future when it's younger and less widely adopted.

I realise the political factors at work. My only point is that society's preoccupation with race/culture blindness is disproportionate relative to its preoccupation with human freedom. That Janssens would be labeled unfit to represent an organisation because at one point, in a conversation he believed was private, he expressed a commonly held type of prejudice, while society accepts the fact that the world is filled with people who aggressively endorse government intervention that robs hundreds of millions of their freedom, leading its most important institutions and organisations, is a shame.

It's far better, because it means more decentralized mining. With ASIC operators reliant on their pool for transaction validation, and a small number of pools dominating the network hashrate, a handful of full nodes control block generation for the entire network. When ASIC operators can use GBT to source tx data from any full node, that increases the potential number of full nodes involved in block generation to thousands, from the 3-4 involved when miners use Stratum.


I made the case for this not being the result of tens of gigabytes per block:


Of course, but until payment channels have been demonstrated to work as a full substitute for on-chain txs in practice, it's still just theoretical, and I don't think Bitcoin's expansion in users should be stalled in the hopes that a theoretical solution becomes practical.

A speculation vehicle has a much weaker network effect than a communication or value transfer network. Currently much of Bitcoin's value is from demand for it as a speculative investment, and its use as a value transfer network is relatively small in terms of users. If its use as a payment and/or settlement network grows, its network effect will grow significantly. The current block size limit, while protecting it from some kinds of censorship, also poses a big risk to the growth of its network effect.

Mining pools are not that important in the grand scheme of thing. ASIC owners can easily switch. This fact alone makes it much less likely that pools would be targeted.

His proposal is to jump from 1 MB to 16.8 MB, and then grow the hard limit automatically by 40% per year every thereafter, for 20 years, so that it reached 16 GB by 2035.
His rationale for 16.8 MB is that a typical broadband connection and PC can handle it, and with Moore's Law and its corollaries, will be able to handle a 40%/yr growth.
I would personally be fine with doing a smaller increase, both immediately (e.g. to 5 or 10 MB), and annually (e.g. 25%). As long as we don't stick with 1 MB and leave the issue of the hard fork to later. I think the psychological impact of having a low hard limit with no consensus around how/when to remove it is very bad for adoption.

But in the event of a split, the end users need to know which validators/servers to trust, which is unlike Bitcoin, where end users simply rely on proof of work. The electrum model is not particularly robust, and Bitcoin would be in trouble if that's all it had. The reliance on trust makes the smooth operation of the network easier to disrupt, as trust in new nodes takes time to build, once established nodes are taken down.

If when 100 million people can access the blockchain on a regular basis, there will be an explosion of financial and engineering-time investment in the core technology, which I predict would accelerate development of scalability solutions, and help the technology get to a stage where everyone in the world can have daily access to decentralized BTC-backed blockchains.
It's an utter waste to leave adoption on the table, by limiting the block size to values far below what the network could bear.
3 tps makes the technology almost insignificant in terms of direct impact, even with technologies like the LN. There's almost nothing to lose from scaling the limit up to meaningful throughput levels IMO. A couple hundred tps would allow the network to have a significant direct impact on the world, and would impose modest bandwidth requirements for running a full node, so I don't see why we don't aim for a limit that permits a throughput level in that ballpark.

Nodes choosing a limit would be even less like existing democratic systems, and more like the market in effect, than miners expressing their preferred limit via voting through blocks. With nodes deciding their own limit, there is less compulsion to conform to majority will, and no "voting" really. Just users spontaneously converging on a consensus. 
The less centralization there is in a consensus mechanism, and the more unstructured it is, the more likely the consensus value will be an accurate reflection of what's in the market's interest, and the less the outcome will be like that seen in modern political systems, IMHO, and users fully controlling their own limit, and converging on a consensus value without a rigid, predefined process, like everyone downloading the latest version of the 'reference client', seems like the most decentralized and least structured way to do it.

Or new people will simply stop using Bitcoin. To assume that not being able to directly access the blockchain, as opposed to using intermediaries (off-chain), will not harm adoption, is not justified by any historical experience.
Keeping the limit at 1 MB and counting on other solutions to pop up is basically using the main Bitcoin network to run an experiment on block space scarcity, with one of the potential casualties being Bitcoin adoption, at a time when Bitcoin should be embracing exponential adoption/growth.
Another harmful potential consequence is that Bitcoin's reputation is shot as people find they can't get their txs confirmed (this is what was happening when the 250 KB soft limit was hit).


It doesn't need to fulfill the world's payment needs. Scaling up 20X or 100X would still massively increase Bitcoin's market capitalization and use-cases. The network effect means that a larger Bitcoin economy makes for a more useful Bitcoin. If 20-100X more people are using Bitcoin, and the market cap is 10X what it is today, I guarantee there will be more financial and engineering resources available to pursue other scaling solutions like the Lightning Network. Size is key, and it shouldn't be sacrificed for the sake of an experiment at a premature 1 MB.

Three reasons:
1. Right now the subsidy is huge, and even if they allowed the maximum number of transactions, transaction fees wouldn't be able to make up more than a tiny percentage of their total revenue, as the maximum it could possibly be is 1 MB worth of transactions. There's  chance that it might not be worth their time to even change the default block size limit. This would change with &gt;16 MB blocks.
2. Miners are going to consider the long term effects of supporting a &gt;16 MB block size hard limit. While an increase in transaction volume from 750KB to 1000KB per 10 minutes would be negligible in terms of mining revenues, an increase from 750KB to 750MB (in 10 years), wouldn't be, so it would be in their interest to support a hard fork that allows this scenario to come about.
3. Most importantly perhaps, IBLT is not implemented yet, so it actually costs them, in the way of an increase in the risk of their block being orphaned, to include txs. IBLT will be implemented soon, which will change that.

While there are similarities between how national governments operate and how BIP-100 style voting would operate, there are a great many differences, that make the history of traditional government an unreliable predictor of how well hashpower based governance will work. 
Some differences include:
* Modern democracies are based on one person = one vote, whereas hashpower based governance is based on the economic majority = political majority. The latter gives those with the greatest stake in the system, and therefore, the greatest incentive to be informed, with the greatest say on the issue at hand. Modern democracies give the majority of the power to those with the least incentive to be informed, and the result is that modern democracies are rife with outcomes that are a result of political ignorance and the propaganda that it breeds.
* Modern democratic systems are extremely complex, as they have to determine thousands of policies. A hashpower vote on the block size limit would determines only a single numerical value.
* Modern democratic systems are extremely inefficient, with voters delegating their power to representatives through a slow, bureaucratic process. The result is much greater opportunity for special interests to hijack the machinations of government and the democratic system for their own interest. A hashpower vote is pure direct democracy.
So I think the likelihood of the mining network acting in what I would argue is its own best interest, and protecting the network's decentralization, is much higher than the likelihood of a democracy acting in its own best interest. Acting as a fail safe system in this setting would be the full node operators, who would retain ultimate power in setting the block size limit, and are whom the miners would defer to.


I agree in general. The protocol should be unchangeable. The block size limit is different than most protocol properties because it needs to change periodically to adjust to changing technological conditions. Therefore, leaving changes up to the hard fork process is unsatisfactory. This proposal would server to make it easier to change the hard limit, but still require significant consensus for one to go through. Best of all, it would decentralize the governance of the block size limit to the maximum extent possible.

It's true that it's not ideal, but I don't think it's that bad. Miners could even download data from 2 or 3 full nodes to see if the data being fed matches up. And they'd be free to change with very little switching costs, making it a pure free market, with maximum competition.

I don't mean just the hashrate. I meant the network in the context of 'network effect': all of the users, projects being developed, merchants accepting it, market capitalization, trading volume, companies geared to use bitcoin, exchanges, wallets, funds invested in Bitcoin companies, etc. This is significant.
As for security, I think PoS is inherently centralized, and therefore I see it as a major strike against any cryptocurrency that uses it.

Investors don't care about your fantasies of digital gold without consumer adoption. Without the prospect of Bitcoin being used for thousands of on-chain retail txs per second, the price of bitcoin would still be $5, there would be 1/10th as many engineers working on the core technology, 1/100th as much VC investment, and 1/100th the utility it has now. 
The message of Bitcoin scaling to thousands of TPS has been communicated from the beginning, in the very first announcement thread that Satoshi created about Bitcoin in late 2008, all the way through 2014, when the Bitcoin wiki explained how easily Bitcoin could scale to Visa-level volumes. It was this prospect of high transaction throughput, that has for years been advertised about Bitcoin, that enticed investors.

Why can't I argue otherwise with brandwidth prediction below 41%? I'm not predicting that Google Fibre calibre connections will grow at 41% per year in availability. Only that they will be much more widely deployed in 20 years than now. That can happen with sub-41% growth rates.


This is a statement of faith, that has come out of nowhere, and been adopted for no reason. Furthermore, there is no telling whether 2 GB blocks will meet all settlement needs. Settlement and payment are not even clearly defined concepts. They're more of a continuum, with large value transfers on one end, and loosely defined as settlement, and small value transactions on the other, and loosely defined as payment.

Yes, of course, how the network will react to larger blocks is just theory at the moment, though we can deduce a lot by the results of testing done by people like Gavin. More importantly, on-chain txs themselves are not theoretical. We know how useful they are, their capabilities, and their limitations. That is more than can be said about as of yet uninvented theoretical off-chain solutions to scaling.


There are absolutely no mechanisms that exist right now that come close to on-chain transactions in their versatility, their proven censorship-resistance, and their ability to be made private.
Human ingenuity could more plausibly address full node decentralization amidst larger blocks, than create a decentralized substitute for on-chain transactions, as reducing the burden of running a full node can be done with straightforward optimization. In the case of the former, there are also long-standing trends like increasing broadband connection speeds (that are also a result of human ingenuity) that are working in our favour. 


I see no justification for this foolhardy and arrogant belief of yours. I really hope Bitcoin's development is not guided by such an unsupported and dismissive position.

The Fidelity Effect doesn't require blocks to be near full to exhibit itself. 
As for your second point: the average consumer doesn't need to adopt it right now for adoption to speed up. Even if it only becomes more appealing to the 1% who could make use of it,  the adoption rate would increase for a long time to come. This in turn would increase the proportion of consumers that find it useful,  because its network effect would grow larger. Much of a financial system's utility comes from network effect.

A blockchain is not pre-packaged and ready to go though. First, from a larger operational standpoint, everything would need to change under a blockchain architecture. All txs would be public, which is a major shift from how it's currently done. This new reality would have major repercussions on other parts of how banks operate. Modifying these operations to contend with the new public tx paradigm would be no small feat at all.
Second, a complex voting system would need to be invented for managing the blockchain, to take the place of proof of work, which would be totally useless, and a waste of economic resources, within a trusted scheme. This voting system would have to be accompanied by a new governance mechanism to determine who gets how many votes, etc. This would be an incredibly ambitious and complex project, and all to implement something that can be done easily via a centralized database.
A blockchain is the wrong tool for the job of trusted exchange IMHO.

End users continued to rely on nothing but PoW to determine the correct chain. The fork was resolved by pool operators downgrading to the old software, which automatically saw the longer chain as invalid, and resulted in their pools building on top of the shorter chain.
So yes, there was human intervention to resolve the fork, but it was a pretty dramatic event, and it only required a handful of people to cooperate. If these events were more common, and required all end users to cooperate to solve, I believe they would be very disruptive, and more likely to result in permanent splits and/or total reliance on a trusted central party.

First of all, a decentralized prediction market could be extremely useful. Augur is an innovative project seeking to introduce a novel service that doesn't currently exist.
Second, a token is not necessarily a currency that claims to replace Bitcoin's function as money. In the case of Augur, their tokens give users a reputation that allows them to vote on events. This token grows or shrinks depending on the accuracy of the votes. It has a real use. Tokenization is the future, and we shouldn't fear it. I just wish there was some way Augur could have been built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, instead of a separate one, or at least use bitcoins for placing bets, instead of a stablecoin. Apparently it will still allow the use of sidechained bitcoins in some context, so it's got that going for it.

Couldn't UTXO older than t minus *n* blocks be pruned from the UTXO set, and a merkle branch linking the UTXO to its respective block header be required to spend it? I think I remember seeing propose something along those lines.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:12:21


They don't need to max out 100mbit/s lines to broadcast 20 MB blocks. Block propagation only requires transmitting the block header and a compact summary of transactions, which is about 1% as big as the transactions themselves. 
20 MB blocks would only require a 0.267 mbit/s connection, as the transactions that make up the block are transmitted continuously throughout the average of 10 minutes in between blocks.


Pruning is going to implemented soon. There's also a high likelihood that UTXO commits are going to be implemented, which will allow relatively high security light nodes.


That has nothing to do with the block size. There are over 6,000 full nodes, and yet most of the network hashrate is controlled by a few pools. Adding more full nodes will not change that, as it's not for lack of full nodes that the largest pools dominate. The preference for using large pools is due to the fact that mining reward variance is reduced by using a larger pool.

Users currently are able to run full nodes if they want to. It's not a significant financial or bandwidth drain to run one at the moment. Many users don't, for convenience, but they could if they wanted to.
So if users want to influence the network-wide block size limit, they can, by simply choosing to run a full node and not raising their personal block size limit.
The proposal has multiple fail-safes: first, we rely on the economic incentive of the mining network to choose a limit that maximizes the value of the network. Such a limit will, I would argue, be one that preserves the core property of decentralization, since that is the quality that provides the network with its value proposition.
Second, we have the desire of major economic stakeholders like hosted wallet companies to satisfy their customers, and not choose a limit that their customers view as endangering Bitcoin's core properties. We have seen how sensitive BItcoin companies are to public criticism (Both Bitpay and Coinbase for example have responded to criticism with blog posts within a day of the criticism getting traction on social media), so it is reasonably likely that they will not acquiesce to a block size limit increase proposal that the majority express dissatisfaction with.
Third, we have end-users who are perfectly capable of firing up their full nodes, if they don't already run one, and refusing to adjust their limit to what the mining majority is requesting, if they perceive it as too high.
I think this is about as good as you could hope for. No proposal is perfect afterall.

I agree with Gavin Andresen's opinion on Patrick Strateman's presentation:






There are solutions like UTXO commits acting as decentralized checkpoints to obviate the need for validating ancient transaction history.

Worst case here is Bitcoin processing 8 GB of tx data per 10 minutes (~27 thousand tx per sec) and a full node having to spend a couple hundred dollars a month to keep up. Seems reasonable for a network with hundreds of millions (or billion+?) of regular users.

Thanks for the tip!


The Antminer S7, which is a next generation ASIC miner, produces 4.66 TH/s and costs $1,585 USD. That's $340.13*s/TH. 
The current hashrate is 450,000 TH/s. It would cost $153 million to match that hashrate with just Antminers. Now in reality, it would take years to produce enough Antminers to produce 450,000 TH/s, and by then the network hashrate would be much higher, so the actual cost of matching the network's hashrate could be higher than this back of the envelope calculation, but the point is that $4 billion would certainly be enough.

This is because IBLT is not implemented yet, so there's a cost associated with including txs. Once it is, the marginal cost for including txs decreases significantly, and even minimal fees make it worth it to include them.

What matters most, IMO, is that Janssens clearly supports a Bitcoin that will benefit everyone, regardless of their cultural or ethnic background, and has contributed significantly to open source Bitcoin projects.

Well, it will increase demand for block space, which means higher fees and more miner revenue. Of course that's assuming there is a block size limit. Without a block size limit, tx fees could trend toward zero (it depends somewhat on whether there is a orphan risk cost to building larger blocks).
Also, do you not see any value in the Bitcoin platform being used by more parties? You don't think there are indirect benefits from the IT teams of major financial institutions becoming more familiar with the platform, and growing accustomed to developing on top of it? You don't think the tools they build for one project to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain would increase the probability that they would embark on new Bitcoin-related projects in the future?

@_date: 2015-10-05 17:33:07


There is no telling how that 10 KB would be apportioned by market forces. Maybe only a handful of financial institutions would do enough volume to make the tx fees economical. Even in a situation where all banks could use the blockchain, and regular people can't, this is exactly what Bitcoin was invented to overcome. Banks are easily controlled by governments, due to how few of them there are relative to people, meaning this new Bitcoin financial system will be just as controlled as the old one.
Furthermore, since the implication here is that off-chain scaling can fully substitute for on-chain scaling let's use a more extreme example of a 1 kB limit and the block time being increased to 24 hours. No problem, since scale can reach infinite levels offchain, right?
In such a situation all access to the blockchain would be intermediated by a very small number financial institutions. Obviously this shows limits on on-chain scalability can be harmful to the network's utility, and all of us should be able to agree that statements to the contrary are wrong.


The LN needs users to be able to create on chain transactions to participate. Each user needs at least one channel, meaning at least one on-chain tx. In other words, global adoption of the LN is not possible with a 10 kB or 1 MB block size limit.
The only possible future that involves mass adoption and a limit of 1 MB or less is one where everyone has to use financial intermediaries.

I stand corrected. I saw this posted further up and I didn't take the time to read into it further.
In any case, the Ripple protocol is not distributed consensus. Consensus is based on trusted parties coming to an  agreement on the state of the ledger, meaning that it is run by parties that are identifiable and can be held liable for what occurs on the network, and meaning that the network can be easily split by targeting these validators. Trust based consensus is inherently brittle.

BIP 101 means 8 GB blocks will be possible in 2035.
8 GB blocks with 400 million users in 2035 doesn't equal a censored network.

I explained how it's not decentralized:
The limit does not necessarily have to be widely supported either for it to remain unchanged. The Bitcoin protocol, by design, is difficult to change. It is like IPv4: once everyone is using it, it becomes exceedingly difficult to update, since it requires a very difficult to coordinate simultaneous upgrade by the majority of the users in order to not cause chaos and damage.
**To overcome the difficulties of doing a hard fork, the Bitcoin community and economy needs to coalesce around an informal governing structure of core developers**, who implement a limit change and deploy it with the cooperation of a handful of gatekeepers in the Bitcoin economy that control critical junctions of communication within the community, like Bitcointalk.org, and bitcoin.org.
What this means is that as long as Bitcoin is dependent on hard forks to scale, a critical component of the protocol is **relatively centralised**, making the process of effecting a limit increase incompatible with a culture of permissionless-ness. This does not engender confidence.

The only protection Bitcoin has against things like this is mass adoption.
The throwaway accounts like Anonobread who rail against raising the block size limit on a daily basis:
Are making a future where people are free to use digital currency less likely. 
As the block size comes up against the limit, and fees start to rise, adoption will slow, giving the forces of control time to catch up and impose all sorts of restrictions on cryptocurrency use before it is protected by mass adoption (the way the internet is now). Remember, governments move slow, but they do move, inexorably toward controlling human activity for the benefit of the elite. It's possible that adoption has already slowed due to the limit, as a result of the [Fidelity Effect](

Statistically speaking, it's not 100% risky. There is an economic dynamic at work, which is that the vast majority of miners don't allow replace-by-fee, that makes it pretty safe. If most of the network hashrate doesn't allow replace-by-fee, then a propagation confirmation gives a pretty high assurance that a 0-conf transaction is safe from a double spend.

explains how, but just in case I can add to it:
Right now banks transfer money by way of correspondent banks, which have reciprocal accounts with other large banks in other countries, enabling them to transfer funds between each other. Each correspondent bank charges a fee.
With BTC, a bank can transfer local currency using an electronic funds transfer system (e.g. ACH) to a domestic Bitcoin exchange, purchase BTC, transfer that BTC to the recipient bank in the other country, which then does the reverse, of selling the BTC at an exchange, and transferring the local currency it receives to its own account.

Miners won't know through the protocol. They will have to find out the old fashioned way, through social interaction and polling of the community. Hard forks would most likely occur exactly the same way as they happen now: with significant discussion and a social agreement by major stakeholders on a date to do the hard fork. 
What I proposed is that the client display this when a threshold number of blocks support a change in the block size limit: 
    The miner expressed limit value preference according to the last 12000 found blocks is 3000000 bytes (3 MB). Unless a recall is issued, miners will switch to this limit in 4000 blocks (block 387124, estimated to be found on December 9, 2015). To switch your personal block size limit to this value, click here. To leave your personal block size limit unchanged and not see this message again, click here.
And a recall could be some mechanism for miners to cancel a scheduled block size limit change, via enough blocks expressing an intent to recall during the confirmation period.

It's going to be some 2-4 MB can-kick, and thus we will need to continue relying on the decisions of Bitcoin Core contributors for future block size limit increases, which means a major quality of the Bitcoin protocol will continue being effectively governed by a small group of people (since everyone will go with what Bitcoin Core decides).
At least BIP 100 would have given the economic majority a practical way to have a say in the block size limit, since obtaining hashing power is only a matter of expending economic resources. This would have been a much larger set of people than the Core contributors.
EDIT Also should note that there seems to be a 'rough consensus' to have network resources other than block size, like the net effect of a block on the size of the UTXO set, become subject to the limit, and that's great to see.

These are financial institutions which have been misled by hype. Ripple is not a significant innovation, despite all of the claims to the contrary by its hypers. It's applying the principle of a public ledger to a centralized database, which I guess is different, but doesn't represent a technological breakthrough. The purpose of a public ledger in Bitcoin is to achieve consensus without a trusted third party. Without that design goal, a public ledger has no purpose.
The smart people in finance are embracing Bitcoin, because distributed consensus is a major breakthrough that actually has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of the financial system. Off the top of my head, here's a list of Fintech start-ups utilizing Bitcoin:

The status quo or a 2-4-8 non-solution will drive the community apart as well, so that's hardly a reason to oppose BIP 101.
But as a practical matter, I would be fine with a more conservative version of BIP 101. e.g. start at 2 MB in 2016, and double every two years until it gets to 2 GB in 2036. This is actually a durable long term solution, unlike "wait and see" (and let this issue continue to fester and divide the community) or a 2-4-8 "can kick".
The best solution of all, IMO, is to not do a hard fork, and instead to change Bitcoin Core so that each individual node operator can easily set their own hard limit, with miner encoding of their preferred block size limit value in the block header serving as the method of coordinating hard forks: @_date: 2015-10-09 13:59:20

Inability of an average user to have a meaningful influence on the limit, and a limit change depending on a difficult, arguably centralized process, is indeed the reason why it hasn't changed from 1 MB in all these years. Hard forks are difficult.
What you cite, in an agreement not being made on a "good way of changing it", is the ultimate cause of the limit remaining at 1 MB, but that doesn't negate the fact that what I cited is the proximal cause.


That's simply not true. With all due respect, you're not looking at the situation realistically. If the limit were removed in Core, the vast majority of users would simply go along with the change, especially considering how much support there is for larger-than-1-MB blocks among the Bitcoin userbase. 
When Theymos instituted the censorship policy toward BitcoinXT, a significant portion of front page posts were about BitcoinXT, with many of them having 90% upvotes. You could resort to believing that this was a conspiracy whereby a small group paid for sock puppets, but then you're ignoring the evidence that most of the comments, from long-time Redditors as well, were in support of it. Bitcoin investors want growth, and most believe large transaction volume would lead to growth.
Anyway, I don't want to go off-tangent too much. My pertinent point is that most users conform to what Core decides. If Core removed the limit, they have enough influence, because of the momentum in people downloading their client when they want to run a full node implementation, that the network and miners would switch to their client and consequently the network at large would cease to have a limit.


Any alternate implementation will face an uphill battle in gaining critical adoption, because of the network effect advantage of Core. Even if it had a limit value that was objectively better, there is no way to prove that a limit value is objectively better, given the complexity that that would involve, and therefore which client will have majority adoption will come mostly down to the influence to shape the perception of less involved members of the Bitcoin community, which Core has a great capability to do due to momentum and built up credibility.


Who said anything about ignoring "developers and scientists"? This is about removing the exclusive group of developers and scientists that control Core from their role as intermediaries between users and hard fork changes. Users can rely on their expertise to inform their judgment, but retain control over hard fork decisions. Decentralization results in more flexible and dynamic systems that are better able to adapt to optimize performance. Therefore, it's better if hard fork decisions are decentralized, and the developers and scientists act in the role advisers, rather than gatekeepers.


Yes that would be ideal. However, even if a long-term solution is implemented, given the unknowns surrounding the limit, I believe it might be wise to implement a solution that empowers individuals to independently and easily opt-in to hard forks, like I described, so that if the long-term solution ends up being ineffective and in need of change, we can more easily hard fork away from it. 
Keep in mind that "more easily" doesn't mean it will be easy to hard fork in this setting. Users still need to see widespread support for the change in the limit before they feel confident enough to change their individual limit setting, lest they be partitioned from the bulk of the network. In many ways the hard fork process will continue to work the same way, with key technical members of the community, particularly influential members of Core, having significant influence in shaping consensus. This just makes the process of doing a hard fork a little less rigid and centralized.


I don't believe Bitcoin should rely on a centralized process for changes that very likely need to be made to a core property of the protocol. The BIP process is good for adding new features to the protocol that are currently not relied upon, but the limit is a critical component of how Bitcoin works now, and very likely will need to be changed periodically for many years, or even decades to come. Any centralized process to govern it effectively makes a key part of Bitcoin centralized, and calls into question claims that it is a decentralized protocol. It also makes it vulnerable to social engineering attacks. Bitcoin is different from, say, Linux, because of how much potential it has to impact the world, and the level of hostility this could illicit toward it. It would be wise to enhance the decentralized mechanism of changing the hard limit, IMHO.

Those people will only climb on board after transactional demand provides enough of a base value that their bet is not pure speculation. The currency has no real scarcity, so it's not going to be seen as a safe store of value just because it exists. Its effective scarcity comes from its network effect advantage over clones, and that has to be developed from the bottom up, starting with small transactions where the technology's advantages compensate for its lower liquidity and greater volatility relative to established currencies and payment networks. 
Demand from these small-transaction use-cases would help grow its liquidity and market cap, which in turn would increase its utility for larger value transactions. The final stage of adoption is the conservative institutional money, which is looking for a low-risk store of value, AFTER adoption by the lower levels of the economic pyramid.

It doesn't presume that. With GBT, the miner can trust another full node to validate transactions, the way miners that use Stratum trust pools now. The difference is that with GBT, the full node that the miner is trusting does not need to be operated by the pool they're using.


Bitcoin also functions better when more people are able to hold their own private keys and create their own transactions, rather than relying on third party intermediaries. With 7 billion users, a low block size limit means the vast majority of people would be totally reliant on using intermediaries to do transactions, since blockchain transactions would have to be huge aggregations of many smaller off-chain transactions. So there is a balance to be struck between the degree of full node centralization, and the degree of blockchain access centralization, with the latter improving with larger blocks, and the former improving with smaller ones, and vice versa.

Not everyone has to run a full node for the Bitcoin network to be sufficiently decentralized to prevent any shenanigans. Anyone who has a broadband connection of a Google Fiber calibre is able to run a full node handling tens of thousands of txs per second. That's millions of people, and it will only increase with time. 
For the purposes of increasing full node count, I think it might actually be more important to increase the number of people involved in the Bitcoin space, and using Bitcoin transactions, than reducing the burden of running a full node. There are millions upon millions of people that could easily run a full node now with their spare capacity of storage and bandwidth, but have no interest or involvement in Bitcoin, and therefore don't. Mass adoption, which will be helped by a much larger base of users and scale of activity, would help in this regard.

It depends on whether there is a block size limit, and if the average block size is coming up against it. If both of these conditions are being met, then any additional demand for block space will increase fee pressure, and with it, miner revenue and demand for BTC for fee payment. Even without these conditions being met, it's possible that the average tx fee is &gt; 0, as it is now, and more txs increases demand for BTC for fee payment.
Also, if Fidelity's assets are represented on the chain, it makes it more likely they will use BTC in smart contracts, since the smart contract and BTC would be interoperable in this scenario.

I believe that Bitcoin is perhaps the most ground-breaking innovation in history, and the most impressive technological project in the world right now, but claims like this exaggerate aspects of its significance, and misinform:


You can't compare the performance of an ASIC-based network on a task that it is specialized to do (in this case it's actually producing SHA256 hashes, and not flops, but let's put that aside) to that of a general purpose supercomputer, and claim it shows that the former is more powerful in general. The price performance of general purpose computers at a well-defined task like generating a SHA256 hash isn't an accurate measure of the cost for a party to perform that task at scale. If any major government wanted to, it could spend $4 billion on ASIC miners and overpower the current mining network, at a tiny fraction of the cost of building a general purpose supercomputer to do it.

This is extremely poor logic. Off-chain scaling doesn't negate the need for on-chain scaling. The less you can do on-chain, the fewer people have access to Bitcoin in its decentralized and censorship resistant form. For example, if the block size limit was 10 KB, and Bitcoin was widely adopted, it might end up with only three major financial institutions being able to afford the tx fees to get their txs confirmed in the blockchain, and as a result, they could act in the role of gatekeepers in controlling access to Bitcoin, or be forced into the role by state-level adversaries.

There's no value in trying to imagine specific examples of how it can drive adoption and grow the economy when it's quite obvious that the potential number of examples is unlimited.

It's not a "cult". It's a logical deduction that you can't have a competitive global financial protocol that is limited to 3 txs/sec. And the most popular plan at the moment is Gavin's, which isn't to "just increase blocksize". Rather it's "increase the blocksize after certain optimizations are made and after discussions on what exactly the appropriate block size increase rate would be".


Please explain why Gavin is wrong:
You've also claimed in this post that a higher transaction throughput would "actually depress price", when the entire value of BTC comes from the economic activity that it is used for, which generally increases with the transaction throughput.

In theory, yes, but in practice, they enforce 1 MB because the reference client uses a 1 MB limit, and should they wish to change the limit, in practice, it will only change if a small group of people who control Bitcoin Core support a change. They have next to no influence on what limit the network as a whole supports. They could potentially support an alternative implementation like BitcoinXT, but it requires a significant effort for a competing implementation to gain momentum, and even then, they're limited to alternative implementations that exist, which is limited to what is released by the limited number of Bitcoin developers with enough credibility and knowledge of the Bitcoin source code to create an alternative implementation.


That's only in a situation where the majority opt-in to the change that the mining majority is proposing, but that is almost identical to the situation of a hard fork where the majority have upgraded their client, and if a person doesn't opt-in to upgrade as well, they will be opting out of Bitcoin.


It's not automated, just much easier for non-developers to initialize, as it's not dependent on developers releasing a client and everyone upgrading to it. Do you think not relying on developers is more centralized than relying on a very small number of developers having a strong enough agreement with each other to be able to convince a very large critical mass of Bitcoin's userbase to upgrade to a new client? How do you figure?


Personally, I see the difficulty of a hard fork to change the limit as making any kind of frequent can-kick solution to the limit, where we decide to do small increases every few years based on need, as very dangerous, because:
* each one of these hard forks could easily be held up by a small and loud minority creating enough contention to prevent the necessary majority from forming in support of a limit change. The difficulty of a client upgrade based hard fork means the level of consensus needed for a hard fork is much higher and therefore it takes less effort to prevent it from being reached. This is not even getting into the vulnerability this would create in Bitcoin to be attacked by adversaries in this in a manner similar to how the [Liberum veto]( when used by the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, was used by hostile powers to freeze that government's decision making capability.
* each one of these hard forks could lead to a disastrous partition of the network, which could easily have happened with BitcoinXT. This risk only increases as time goes on and the Bitcoin community gets larger. Increases in the size of the community, both general and technical, makes consensus based on political agreement harder, and splits more likely.
* each hard fork requires a significant degree of centralization around an ad hoc governance structure of influential developers capable of mustering enough support in the community to push through a hard fork. Given the poor scalability of social governing structures, the number of people who comprise this governing structure will likely not grow much in size even as the Bitcoin community grows, meaning the process of converging on a consensus to hard fork will become increasingly centralized as the size of the Bitcoin community increases.

The greed portion is based almost solely on speculation that demand for it will skyrocket for use as an every day currency for transactions like latte purchases and remittances.

Without Bitcoin adopting his proposal, it's impossible for him to prove himself right or wrong. That doesn't mean we can't change Bitcoin to have something other than a 1 MB block size limit. 
Those who want to maintain a 1 MB hard limit, originally put in place as a temporary anti-spam limit, have no way to prove that this is the right limit, so neither decision, to keep the limit, or raise it, can be justified with proof.
In the absence of definitive proof, arguments like that presented by Gavin are what we need to rely on, and thus I would appreciate that you address it if you maintain Bitcoin cannot scale.

The worst case scenario in Ripple I believe is much more likely as it's much easier to disrupt Ripple consensus by attacking its validators than to disrupt Bitcoin consensus by attacking mining nodes.


You can't transfer real EUR with Ripple, only IOUs. Real settlement happens with either an international wire transfer or with domestic wire transfer. By using bitcoin as the transfer medium, the international transfer of value happens without relying on credit issued by any trusted third party. The requirement to convert bitcoin out-of/into fiat at the origination/destination points adds cost, but it allows for final settlement without trust between participants in different jurisdictions.

So you're saying solutions exist, but that you're not willing to list them. You're not making a compelling argument to not worry about the hard cap.


Let's use system failure as way to create pressure for a solution to emerge! Great plan!
Here's a good explanation for why this is a terrible idea, from &gt;My experience of (centralized) financial systems over many years is that ignoring hardware and software constraints as they are approached invariably causes outages. Also, that trying to train a user-base or worse, a market, to behave differently to accommodate IT constraints is a Sisyphean task. There are probably hundreds of IT experts who are concerned about the block size limit, because they can see the risks in it, which they recognize from prior (usually bitter) experience.


If there are solutions, they should be revealed now, not revealed after the Bitcoin user experience goes in the trash as a result of outages.


No one is saying on-chain should be the only solution. Raising the hard cap can be done in conjunction with the rolling out of the Lightning Network. Even with unlimited block sizes, other solutions will be preferable to on-chain transactions for some use-cases. There's no need to deliberately create outages in Bitcoin for the sake of making other solutions more feasible.


The cables carrying TCP/IP data don't have any artificial hard cap on bandwidth. Larger blocks is something that both Satoshi and Gavin thought/think are needed, yet you insult everyone who holds this opinion without providing any compelling reason for your claim that there's nothing to worry about.

Theymos once [proposed]( allowing users to set their own block size limit, which would mean that ultimately, the consensus among full node operators would set the effective block size limit of the protocol, since any outliers would find themselves partitioned off of the main network of users.
A possible enhancement of this proposal could be to allow miners to express their intention to raise their limit, via BIP-100 style encoding of their preferred limit value in the block header, and have these expressions of limit preferences displayed to users in their client. 
Then users could decide for themselves whether to set their client's limit to what the mining majority is expressing as their preferred limit. This would be utilizing the Byzantine Fault Tolerant communication mechanism used to arrive at consensus in Bitcoin, to reliably, without trusted intermediaries, express the mining majority's preferences to the userbase, but still reserve the ultimate power in raising the effective block size limit for end users running full nodes.

It's not dumb luck that miners don't allow replace-by-fee, and that thieves don't use it. It's statistically an ineffective tactic for thieves in many circumstances because the odds of successfully double spending a transaction that has propagated is quite low under the current configuration when no major pools do replace-by-fee. This means that unless there is zero financial cost in failure scenarios (e.g. depositing to an e-wallet, where you can withdraw if the double spend fails), it is not generally profitable to use this strategy.
The reason miners don't allow txs to be replaced by fee is that if their acceptance triggers a chain reaction of other miners also adopting replace-by-fee, that would make 0-conf txs less viable, and thus reduce the utility of the Bitcoin network, which they hold a long-term stake in. There are perfectly logical reasons why we could imagine a future where 0-conf transactions that have propagated remain quite safe from a double spend.

It's more decentralized to have miners relying on thousands of different full nodes to validate their transactions than for them to rely on 3 or 4.


If the number of transactions that enter the blockchain itself decreases, that means that people cannot have their own private keys, because they cannot afford to create blockchain transactions themselves. This would only leave large bank-like entities with the capability to use the blockchain themselves, and everyone else relying on those bank like entities and using credit issued by them.

I did not know that. I searched and wasn't able to find their latest work. Now assuming this, and these systems' vulnerability to selfish mining, are somehow solvable, and fast confirmations become possible, I don't see why using the blockchain for payments would be a bad thing.
Yes, decentralization is important, but bandwidth is going to increase. Bitcoin doesn't need to be handling the entire world's transaction throughput next year. It will take time for consumer demand to reach global proportions, and by then there is a real likelihood that bandwidth performance will have improved enough for the average person to be able to run a full node that uses up hundreds of MB of bandwidth per second.


I agree, ideally miners would be anonymous, and we wouldn't be able to count on trustworthy pools. However, for the foreseeable future, identifiable pools will dominate the network hashrate. If and when Bitcoin reaches a state where mining becomes truly anonymous and decentralized, there may by then be other solutions available to do zero-conf transactions, like some variation of the sharechain weighted by orphan-share idea. 


I think 10 minutes rather than a few weeks before final settlement makes a big difference in whether someone will be willing to rely on a zero-conf transaction made by an untrusted party. The risk of getting caught goes up if the double spend needs to be done within a couple minutes of leaving the store, compared to a couple days.


At this point, as great as applications of micropayment channels seem in theory, they're still just theory. On-chain transactions are used in practice, and seem to work well for people.


I should have written: why does consensus have to take 10 minutes? Yes, it will take time, but maybe - and you're far more qualified than me about this - the shortcomings in GHOST-like protocols can be overcome, and it can far less than 10 minutes without compromising decentralization.

Wouldn't it be better described as Bitcoin enforced off-chain transactions? The transactions never have to hit the blockchain, but can be if there is ever a dispute. The transaction script, which is analogous to a legal contract, will then be enforced by the blockchain, which would be acting in the role of an adjudicator. The reason it would work so well is that the contracts are formally defined, which allows Bitcoin nodes to validate transactions automatically and unambiguously.

I directly referenced a payment channel solution: the Lightning Network. We have no idea when it will be implemented, whether it will substitute all on-chain transactions (e.g. there could be privacy issues with the hub and spoke method that can only be resolved through the availability of cheap on-chain transactions), or whether 1 MB will be adequate (the authors of the paper said a higher/dynamic block size limit will be needed).


It would mean an economy that is 20-100X bigger.


You're ignoring the economic benefits of more use and mindshare. With the number of people using Bitcoin increasing from, say, 200,000, to 5 million, that can have tremendous spin-off benefits, like more people working on Bitcoin start ups, more people working on open-source initiatives like the Lightning Network, more funding available for Bitcoin projects, etc. It's a stepping stone for better scaling solutions. We may also see broadband connections and storage performance improve over the next couple of decades and allow us to gradually get to global scale transaction throughputs via on-chain transactions.

The difference is you're not trusting any individual miner to be a trustworthy party. You're trusting the **fact** that miners, in the aggregate, will act in their own economic self-interest, which is not dependent on their being trustworthy.
So with trusted banks, you're relying on a party being trustworthy, while with a proof of work mining network, you're relying on more than 50% of miners acting rationally. In the latter, you're not relying on trust (in the context of someone being a trustworthy party).


And I've explained why it's pointless to have a blockchain when the parties are trusted/vetted.

None of what you said is true. Parties other than corporations will be able to run full nodes if blocks get large. You're claiming it'll be only "Corporations" because the word pushes emotional buttons. In reality, a large enough Bitcoin co-op, educational institution, or any other organisation with sufficient resources, could run a full node with super large blocks.
Furthermore, under BIP 101, which is the most aggressive proposal on the table right now, blocks don't get super large. Many individuals will be able to run full nodes, because the block size limit will start at 8 MB, and be capped at 8 GB by 2035. Personal computers with consumer grade internet can handle 8 GB of bandwidth in some places in the world right now. This will be true in many more places by 2035. Your fearmongering about "only Corporations being able to run full nodes in data centers owned by other Corporations" is simply dishonest.

The "many times" is not a requirement. Uploading/downloading to/from 2 peers is sufficient to be a fully validating node that contributes to propagation. And new blocks can be compressed given they consist mostly of txs that nodes already have in their mempool.


I don't think these are bold predictions. There's no reason why you should have to download all transactions a second time when a new block is found. I think it's reasonable to assume that block compression can be implemented if there's a pressing need to reduce bandwidth requirements.

Banks can be forced to adopt Bitcoin the way they were forced to adopt the internet. Mass adoption could make it the internet of money that everyone needs to interface with to move value efficiently. That will never happen with a throughput limit of three transactions per second.
Unfortunately a large segment of the community has convinced itself that success can happen without the messy phase of rapid adoption, like what the internet went through in the 1990s. During that period, doomsayers were warning that the telecommunication network was going to fail because it wouldn't be able to handle the growing internet usage. But the internet forged ahead without being forced to route new traffic through "offchain" solutions, and the doom that was predicted never materialised.

Strawman. No one said anything about "68 trillion users buying coffees at 10 cups a second". In any case, my point is that the 3 tps limit makes adoption by 68 million people impossible. I take it you agree? Or are you still claiming that people are going to switch to a decentralized bank account that they can only access once a year?


Straw man. On-chain txs don't have to be used as a substitute for cash. One tx per day per user would be sufficient for the blockchain to act as a bank account, and there is reason to believe that blocks large enough to allow that for tens/hundreds of millions of people would not cause the network to fail.

Ripple is like a centralized e-wallet with a public ledger. It's not inherently bad. What's bad is the misconception, being promoted by its pumpers, that it has anything to do with decentralization or distributed consensus. It offers nothing substantially new. At best, it provides some minor efficiency advantages gains over existing implementations of trusted third party banking. All the vulnerabilities that exist with centralized payment networks exist with Ripple.

I'm assuming SWIFT vets participants, but does not get involved in transaction disputes. It's a closed communication network. Transaction disputes are avoided by using trusted correspondent banks.

I was referring to decentralization of distributed consensus systems, where all participants have a complete and consistent view of the global state.
Even then, I guess it depends on what kind of decentralization we're talking about. Decentralization of end user access to the blockchain is improved with more scale, while decentralization of full nodes is harmed. And even the latter makes certain assumptions, like larger scale not boosting the userbase, which in turn counteracts the inhibiting effect of greater full node resource requirements on full node count.

For most of the world's population, $20 is far too much to pay to participate in a festival or the LN. Furthermore, one tx - $20 - is the absolute minimum required. It is very possible that to participate while maintaining reasonable privacy, and consumer choice, you will need multiple direct LN peers, and switch them up every few months, so multiple on-chain txs, every few months, which further increases costs, and makes Bitcoin even less accessible with $20 tx fees.

A public database is a major privacy liability. The only reason it's needed in Bitcoin is that Bitcoin doesn't use a trusted third party, and therefore the public has to be able to verify the transaction record themselves. As soon as you introduce a trusted third party, a public ledger becomes useless. If you're already trusting a trusted third party to not rewrite history, why not just trust the history they give.

In my opinion, there is a very real possibility that the large pools, controlling the lionshare of the network hashrate, will refuse to adopt replace-by-fee, because they view it as harmful to the utility of Bitcoin, and therefore counter to their long term interests, which is the success of Bitcoin. I also think the extra revenue earned from replace-by-fee will be a pittance. People don't often seek to do double spends.


That's not how it works. Nodes accept all blocks that have valid transactions, meaning transactions that don't double spend txs that are already in blocks. Double spending a 0-conf tx is perfectly valid from the perspective of all nodes, regardless of whether they allow 0-conf txs to be replaced by fee.

Mining pools also have a long-term stake in the utility of the Bitcoin network, and a large mining pool will know that their decision to allow replace-by-fee can directly harm that utility, both directly, by increasing the success rate of attempts to double spend 0-conf txs that have propagated, and indirectly, by possibly triggering a chain-reaction of other mining pools accepting replace-by-fee. 
For these reasons, there's a good likelihood that large mining pools will not use software that allows 0-conf txs to be replaced by fee, especially if we discourage them from doing so.

Having a limit that automatically increases over time will allow Bitcoin to scale while still reducing the risk of centralisation.

We're most likely not going to get any chance of doing a hard fork in the future.

We can have a 1 MB limit imposed without having it be a dangerous and inflexible hard limit.

That's a big IF. This post makes a convincing case that miners will be able to run their own full nodes if BIP 101, which is the most aggressive proposal on the table, were adopted:
The SPV mining that's occurring is mostly a result of miner ignorance, rather than the cost of running a full node, and there are plenty of ways to address it other than limiting block size to very small values.


The problem is that the reward for cheating and building a fake UTXO commitment is literally INFINITY bitcoins.
(Remember that the reward for building a fake chain is maximum 21 million bitcoins if everybody is using full nodes).
First of all, how can the attacker get infinity bitcoins when full nodes can reconstruct the UTXO set of the UTXO root commitment that they're trusting as a checkpoint? The most the attacker could get is 21 million bitcoin, as any value higher will be proof of fraud.
Second, it doesn't matter if an attacker can get infinite bitcoins when the amount of goods they can get in a given amount of time is limited. Remember that such an attack would quickly be uncovered, since only a download of the full blockchain is required to prove it, and a massive reorganization would signal the introduction of the fake UTXO checkpoint. 
If for instance it takes 6 hours for every BTC-accepting merchant to stop selling merchandise for BTC, that means the attacker has to be able to clear out enough of the inventory of hundreds of thousands of merchants with BTC in a much shorter period of time than 6 hours (since most merchants would stop accepting BTC well before six hours), to make up for the massive cost of all of the mining equipment required to outrun the rest of the mining network for months/years. 
There are so many practical difficulties and potential problems in conducting such an attack and actually making a profit off of it, that I don't believe we need to worry about it. Just thinking through what such an attack would take, I think the odds of it happening are astronomically low. The benefits to Bitcoin, in giving tens, if not hundreds of millions of people access to the blockchain, far outweigh the risks of opening up the network to some cataclysmic 5-years-of-PoW 51% attack, of moving to a PoW-based checkpoint system IMO.


Both the growth of BTC's value, and the growth of mining cost-efficiency, will decrease as the Bitcoin economy matures, so at equilibrium, even assuming Moore's Law continues, the cost of generating 5 years worth of PoW will be much more than the cost to do so now.

This proof is redundant, as you're already trusting them to not break a set of rules (e.g. not contracting proof of work from outside the network, not rewrite blockchain). This proof is trustless, but you've already created a scheme that can be compromised if the participant is untrustworthy, so it's a waste of work to produce this proof.

Bitcoin companies were counting on rapid early stage growth in the economy, which didn't materialise. Like I have been saying for years, the 1 MB limit is a major obstacle to Bitcoin achieving any appreciable scale of adoption, because it is extremely difficult to change, and hurts investor/business confidence in the likelihood of rapid adoption occurring, which in turn becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy (less investment -&gt; less adoption, aka "the Fidelity Effect").
The limit does not necessarily have to be widely supported either for it to remain unchanged. The Bitcoin protocol, by design, is difficult to change. It is like IP4: once everyone is using it, it becomes exceedingly difficult to update, since it requires a very difficult to coordinate simultaneous upgrade by the majority of the users in order to not cause chaos and damage.
To overcome the difficulties of doing a hard fork, the Bitcoin community and economy needs to coalesce around an informal governing structure of core developer, who implement a limit change and deploy it with the cooperation of a handful of gatekeepers in the Bitcoin economy that control critical junctions of communication within the community, like Bitcointalk.org, and bitcoin.org.
What this means is that as long as Bitcoin is dependent on hard forks to scale, a critical component of the protocol is relatively centralised, making the process of effecting a limit increase incompatible with a culture of permissionless-ness. This does not engender confidence.
I get it, "Core devs representing over 90% of commits" don't want a permissive hard limit schedule implemented, as Szabo argues. But the purpose of Bitcoin wasn't to replace a political elite with a developer elite. Dependency on a very small developer community looks like centralization of power to the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem. That does not engender confidence. That is why I don't support proposals like Adam Back's 2-4-8. They preserve this dependency on the developer minority for future growth in network usage, and thereby forestall the time when Bitcoin can be a truly decentralized protocol.
It's one thing to fall back on this de facto governance structure that are the developers in a crisis (e.g. a chain fork). It's another for Bitcoin to depend on it to be capable of allowing any appreciable portion of the world's population to use it.

I thought you were referring to CC fraudsters who use stolen CCs. Yes in the case of chargeback fraud, they can lose. The advantage that zero-conf has over CCs is that the merchant would find out in 10 minutes that they've been defrauded, which increases the risk for the fraudster.


I will not complain to the BTC community. It is risky to use, and I would only be willing to risk what I'm willing to lose on a zero-conf tx.
@_date: 2015-02-23 09:17:09
It's different in that a double spend has a risk of the thief losing their BTC, as it can actually fail, while CC fraud is guaranteed to not cost the thief their USD. Also CC fraud can involve large amounts, while no one is encouraging people to accept zero-conf transactions for large value sales. 
Anyway, despite the risk of fraud, merchants are willing to accept CCs. Obviously it's still profitable for them. Let's allow zero-conf txs, and see how it plays out. People will adjust their behavior according to the risks. No need to deliberately increase those risks. We would only be eliminating possibly viable trade-offs that exist in the lower-risk zero-conf ecosystem (an ecosystem where miners are not encouraged to allow zero-conf transactions to be double spent).

Because we're talking about an infrequent event that changes a core property of the protocol. The requirement of users to opt-in like this for the change to take effect is so that this core property cannot be changed by the mining minority to a value that is against the interests of the majority.
The alternate opt-in method is to do it via a hard fork, which is even more 'manual', or to bake in a limit increase schedule, that could end up being too high or too low for future technological conditions, with no way but another dangerous/difficult hard fork to deviate from it.
This is a way for the network to arrive at a consensus on a limit change in a manner that requires significant consensus, but is easier to execute than a hard fork, and much less centralized, since unlike a hard fork, it doesn't require a small group of technically proficient individuals to release a credible full node implementation, and for every user that supports the change to more or less simultaneously install that new client.


Mining is done so we can reach decentralized consensus rapidly. Consensus can still be achieved in a somewhat decentralized fashion through a social/manual process, but it's slow, and the time it takes to reach consensus through this method is less predictable. That is the process used to decide on a hard fork for example. This proposal, on the face of it, seems better than changing the limit via hard forks. It's less centralized and easier.

I don't think the research and articles in recent months have shown PoS to be secure or put to rest the concerns about it. PoS is still ultimately based on trust, as Vitalik acknowledges. The argument of the PoS supporters is that a PoW currency is also based on some trust, in trusting who you download the client from, and that this is generally secure, and that a PoS currency's reliance on trust is only different in matter of degree.
What's glossed over and not acknowledged, in my opinion, is that a PoS currency can be severely disrupted for existing users, by attacking the highly trusted parties, while a PoW currency cannot. Once users have to rely on people they personally trust for checkpointing, because all trusted centres within the community have been shut down or co-opted, the ease of use drops off, and only the highly involved members of the community will be left. 
And PoS can be directly attacked in ways that PoW cannot. People who once owned PoS coins can use the private keys that once controlled their coins to vote for a fork chain, at no cost to themselves. Buying up private keys that once held coins can be a very cheap (relatively speaking) way to create a fork. This contrasts with PoW, where it is very expensive to create a fork.
The proposed defence against this is to require stake voters to put up deposits, and for the blockchain to use trusted checkpointing in between deposit periods to prevent long range attacks by parties in control of private keys to old coins. The idea being that stakeholders won't cheat if it means they'll lose their deposit. Putting aside the centralizing tendencies of a protocol that relies on periodic checkpointing from trusted parties, the deposit itself might not be enough to prevent an attack. If the attacker can manipulate the algorithm that selects the future stakeholders, they can potentially control block selection for the entire deposit period. 
There are so many unresolved issues like this, that I believe cannot be fixed, because fundamentally, a nothing-at-stake method is not secure, and has to rely on a different method as a back-up. Reliance on trusted third parties is nothing new, and does not permit secure distributed consensus on blockchains.

Yeah that's a totally baseless prediction. 1 MB is an arbitrary limit. There was no analysis done on it. There's absolutely no reason to assume the right limit isn't something greater. And if consumer bandwidth and storage increase, as they undoubtedly will, the limit can be increased proportionally with no reduction in the ability of the average person to run a full node.
Meanwhile, hampering adoption, by stubbornly making a temporary 1 MB anti-spam restriction into a permanent limit, in the hopes of forcing the market to invent off-chain solutions that can substitute for peer-to-peer on chain txs, sacrifices what gives Bitcoin the most protection against laws to restrict and ban it: more stakeholders and public acceptance, and the ability of people to bypass financial intermediaries when doing Bitcoin txs.

The risk of waiting until we hit the limit is that when the blocks hit it, the utility of Bitcoin could drop off a cliff, and there could be widespread dissatisfaction with Bitcoin's relatively small community of users over tx confirmations being delayed. This happened when the 250 KB soft limit was hit. Luckily it was a soft limit and could be quickly removed. If this limit is a hard one, that will not be easy to remove, and it might cause an extended period of block space shortage, until the entire userbase finally transitions to an updated client. An extreme and extended shortage of block space could cause permanent reputational damage to Bitcoin and cause many people to give up on it.
Another thing is that we might not see any major adoption pushes until the 1 MB anti-spam restriction is removed. This is because until the hard fork happens, major investors don't have a clear picture of when and how the hard fork will happen and therefore might not feel confident investing in campaigns to sign up retail merchants that might not get any txs due to space running out in blocks. This uncertainty hangs over the Bitcoin economy and could be a major damper on adoption.

Financial compensation is how people are always incentivized, in both the for-profit sector and in government. What do you think incentivizes people who work in government agencies, if not earning salary, building work experience (to improve their income-earning potential), and keeping their job? Do you think people who accept job offers with the government are altruists? 
Or to put another way: why is it that you think the primary objective of those working in government is to do their job, rather than to earn a salary, while you think the primary objective of those working for and running a private company is to earn a profit, rather than do their job? It seems like you have preconceived notions about government and the private sector that is assumes there is something inherently different about the nature of people who work for government, and there's no good basis for this assumption.

True. Arguably, even if Bitcoin achieved global mass adoption, and there were thousands of businesses that ran full nodes, a situation where 7 billion people rely on a few thousands nodes is not enough for a decentralized currency. Perhaps it is, but just to be safe, we can disallow 6 GB blocks at the moment, and instead have the block size limit grow gradually every year until it gets there, at which point broadband connection speeds and HDD capacity would permit even regular individuals to host full nodes, meaning there would be hundreds of thousands of full nodes.
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:30:25
We don't know the figure, but it's at whatever level that we deem decentralization is being excessively compromised (meaning the distribution of full nodes is reaching a point where regulations and bans become a possibility, and a threat to the network as a whole). We're no where near that point right now. We have thousands of full nodes, and many more could be turned on if there was a major need.

Coinbase is an excellent currency exchange, but it's not an excellent wallet. And that's not because of anything Coinbase did. It's simply a result of Coinbase having legal liabilities as a counterparty and payment intermediary, that forces it to censor what kind of transactions its clients make. 
As long as people have no option to use the blockchain directly for their transactions, their choice will be limited to centralised parties like Coinbase, which always face legal liabilities and pose a counterparty risk. Being able to choose from any centralized bank in the world doesn't mean we will have the freedom to do anything we want with our money with low fees. 
In the current banking system, people could theoretically do their banking with almost any bank in the world, through international wire transfers and online accounts, but they don't, because the centralised structure of banks means that they get regulated, everywhere in the world.

He wants to raise the block size limit so that fewer people need to use off chain transactions. On the one hand you're faulting him for wanting to reduce off chain transactions by raising the block size limit.

It looks like whatever Gavin does, you'll attack him.

I really appreciate Maxwell explaining what's motivating his very conservative views on the block size limit here:
But what I don't understand is why he thinks the limit increasing will have a significant centralizing effect on mining. From what I've gathered, there are other factors in mining that far eclipse the role of block size in encouraging centralization, and will likely continue to eclipse it under a limit on the scale of what's proposed in BIP 101. 
This testimony from a 0.25 percent miner makes a good case for that:
The biggest contributor to the dominance of large pools is the suppressing effect of hashrate on payout variance. How large a share of the total network hashrate a mining pool has is what ASIC owners are looking for when considering which pool to join.

If it starts happening, and people start being hit, then the practice of accepting 0-conf transactions will stop. So what? Let's say it happens in three years. The damage from a few hundred merchants having a few small value items stolen from them, on a single occasion, is not very large. On the plus side, for three years, people will have done millions of 0-conf transactions, which are more convenient and decentralized than other methods. The benefit of having 0-confs txs for 1, 2, or 3 years far outweighs the costs of a hypothetical Black Swan event.


The incentive is to steal a bunch of small value items, while allowing eye-witnesses to see the faces of hundreds of co-conspirators in this low-value, high-cost heist. It's not a particularly attractive heist.

Most transactions happening on other blockchains means widespread adoption of Bitcoin never happened.

Things like having to install a new HDD, upgrade one's bandwidth, etc as average block and total blockchain size increases. Actually I shouldn't have written it will come with huge problems, as those don't qualify as "huge" problems, and some of them might never materialise if technology progresses faster than the average block size and if certain optimisations are made to Bitcoin (e.g. pruning transactions of old blocks and leaving only their headers).

There's no way people will rely on a UTXO set that's not backed by proof of work. There would have to be a UTXO set commit for the externally sourced UTXO sets to be relied upon. And I think claiming full nodes will not be able to validate all of the transactions themselves, and have to rely on others doing the validation, if the blockchain gets bigger, is quite an assumption.
The surest way to allow authorities in authoritarian countries and even liberal democracies to impose effective blacklists is to limit access to the blockchain to only a small number of financial intermediaries, and force everyone to use their off-chain solutions, by keeping blocks limited to 1 MB of transaction data for millions of users. 
Intermediaries are easy to regulate. Look how Coinbase is forced by regulations to spy on users' accounts and close them if they find they're spending on the wrong things. Less direct access to the blockchain in a 1 MB restricted low-bandwidth scenario means more reliance on intermediaries that can be much more easily regulated than the global full node collective under a &gt;16 MB / block high bandwidth scenario.

You mean the limit or actual throughput? The limit is infinite. The actual throughput is probably pretty high, given how much of the world uses gold, but not as high as an electronic payment or settlement system like Visa or SWIFT.

It will need a network effect, which is best achieved by being used as a value transfer network.

Of course, and that goes for government agency's political masters too. They only care about the "perception" that they're doing their job. Luckily, perception generally aligns with reality. It's not a perfect match, but it's enough to slowly drive progress, especially when people are free to use different options, as in the free market, rather than bound to subsidize a monopoly, as with government taxation for regulatory agencies.


Yelp might not be the end-all-be-all of review sites. The online review market is a new field, and it's a work in progress. It also does not deal with critical issues like food safety, so it has the latitude to be less stringent with how runs its review site. If we had no food safety regulators paid for by government, people would undoubtedly create a market for food safety certifiers, and we would expect them to take accuracy more seriously than Yelp, as failure in food safety certification means death.


I don't see how that discounts the support this gives to the notion that the market, in sectors without government regulators, finds ways to produce credible information.


It can be analyzed at any point in the chain. Why do you assume that certifiers wouldn't exist for different levels in the chain?

If you're referring to sidechains, even they are not enough to allow Bitcoin to achieve mass adoption without raising the block size limit. As the linked analysis shows, mass adoption with the 1 MB restriction in place means each person would be able to access the block chain about once per decade. Even if you use sidechains for the bulk of your transactions, you need to access the main chain more than that for it to be of any use. The only scenario where Bitcoin achieves mass adoption with the 1 MB restriction in place is one where only large financial institutions directly access the block chain, and everyone else has to use them as intermediaries.

I don't know how the most popular merchant pos software currently handles it, but I'm confident those involved will eventually figure it out, and I assume it wouldn't take long when the merchant sees the payment they received has been canceled 10 minutes later.
As for what they do when the theft happens: how is that relevant and how am I supposed to know how each affected merchant will handle it? The point is, the worst that can happen is that they have their low-value items stolen. Very soon after, they will stop accepting 0-conf txs. This is the big 'Black Swan' event. Nothing more drastic than that. In order to reduce the possibility that this could one day occur to zero, you want to make a decision for others not to be able to use 0-conf txs for point of sale.

You don't have to prove you're a full node. You have to simply provide the transaction data upon request. If you are unable to produce accurate/up-to-date transaction data to SPV clients, SPV clients will sever their relationship with you, and stop paying for tx data downloads.

Consider how much broadband connection speeds and hard disc capacity have increased since 1995, and imagine how far along they'll be in 20 years. In the worst case scenario, that broadband connection speeds begin to stagnate, we have many other tools at our disposal to limit block size, that are much more flexible than a crude hard limit at the protocol level. I don't believe that protocol rules should be used to try to get the block limit at just the right size. Protocol rules on block size are dangerous if they're too low, and so should be higher than our anticipated need, and only there as a fail-safe.

No, the biggest risk to Bitcoin is that user experience diminishes after the block size starts coming up against the hard cap, preventing further adoption after a certain point. This is a classic problem with systems that aren't designed to be scalable. The hard cap makes Bitcoin extremely unscalable. It's absolutely reasonable to be concerned about this, and many are.

Because thin clients are a better alternative to full nodes for most people. The full node count was bound to go down after several high quality mobile wallets were released. There are some excellent full node optimizations in the pipeline, thanks to the incredible work of the developers, that will improve the full node situation, but long term most people are going to use thin clients because it's 'good enough' security/privacy for a typical user, and it can be run on a mobile phone, which makes it much more useful.
I think the only thing that can really significantly increase the full node count is more Bitcoin users. The number of people that would potentially run a full node is limited by the number of Bitcoin users. My guess is that mass adoption would = an exponentially larger number of full nodes.

As for the alert key, it's just a messaging system, for one implementation, Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core is not the official client, it's just the most popular client for full nodes.

Bandwidth is generally a greater expense than storage in applications. With 50,000 full nodes (or their imitators), each one would be serving 140,000 SPV clients. That's a lot of downloads for a repeater, that could be saved if it simply became a full node and stored the full blockchain locally.

Even with sidechains, unless the average person is only going to access the main chain once every decade, the block size restriction needs to be lifted for Bitcoin to scale to hundreds of millions of users who are not reliant on major financial institutions.
Aside from the inability of sidechains to negate the need to remove the 1 MB block size restriction, resting Bitcoin's entire future scalability on an entirely new and untested technology that has not even been definitively declared to become a part of the Bitcoin protocol (I hope it does!) is extremely risky and totally unnecessary.
Bitcoin shouldn't have unlimited block sizes, and it shouldn't make a 1 MB (anti-spam) restriction permanent.

Then 68 million unbanked people are not going to use any 'Plan B' involving the blockchain. Using the blockchain once every 12 months is virtually the same as remaining unbanked, and 68 million people choosing to place a large portion of their liquid capital in a blockchain that they can directly access no more than once a year is totally unrealistic anyway.


There is no proof whatsoever that blocks large enough to provide daily access to &gt;68 million people would damn the network to fail. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have the means to run full nodes that use &gt;1-Mb/s of bandwidth, meaning blocks could very likely be substantially larger than they are now without Bitcoin losing its permissionless-ness.

Exactly the opposite is the case IMO. There are no satisfactory workarounds to directly using the blockchain. There are workarounds to the hard limit being too high, like imposing a soft limit.


What's more dangerous is setting Bitcoin up to have to do a hard fork in five years to scale further at that point. This may be the last chance we have to do a hard fork on the block size, as hard forks on critical parameters get more difficult as the community gets larger.

I'm all for being strategic with how Bitcoin is developed to protect the brand, but in the case of privacy protection, I think the utility it gives trumps any negative publicity it might engender.
Soccer moms don't want the world to be able to deduce their spending habits by merely looking at the blockchain with knowledge of a single tx they made either. Everyday utility can make the difference between someone trying bitcoin out once, seeing it's not practical for them for some reason, and never using it again, and someone trying it once, seeing it offers them value, and using it regularly for business. Privacy protection is a basic requirement for financial transactions, and Bitcoin needs it for its usefulness to be maximized.

Bitcoin is not based on trust on any central party. It's based on trust that over 50% of the economic resources securing the network are being contributed by honest parties. The PoW is a distributed, incorruptible vote in that sense, and Bitcoin is based on its majority decision. This is unlike any other type of vote, including a PoS vote, in which case a trusted central party needs to act as a ledger to determine which votes are valid. PoS did not solve the Byzantine General's problem, PoW did.

The individual block size limit for block creation set by each miner. The default is currently 750 KB. Miners coordinating to reduce this value has been a way to limit block size before (e.g. when they set it at 250 KB).
The minimum transaction value that will be relayed by default. This indirectly reduces the block size, because the finiteness of BTC's quantity makes the maximum number of transactions that can be generated inversely proportional to the minimum allowable transaction value.
Various types of soft forks can limit the block size. The most straightforward would be a soft fork that has miners refuse to build on top of blocks exceeding a certain size. This would not be a protocol rule, but would act like one.
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:45:57
This is an excellent message, especially coming from Coinbase which had not made a clear statement on its position on altcoins until now.

With SPV you're also trusting the nodes you're connected to, to tell you if a transaction is spending a UTXO that has already been spent. With UTXO commit checkpoints, you're validating all of the blocks that came after the commitment for yourself. 
There is also the fact that with SPV, an attacker only needs to outrun the rest of the mining network for whatever number of blocks SPV-merchants require for confirmations, which right now is often 1, and even in conservative cases, 6, and so can have a very small share of the hashrate and still manage to pull off the attack, while with UTXO-commit checkpoints, it can be 5 years worth of blocks, which means the attacker needs more than 50% of the hashrate to have any realistic chance of pulling it off.
So I don't see how it's in any way comparable.

Gavin's proposal is ~16.8 MB limit now, and then 1.4X increase every year afterward for 20 years.
@_date: 2015-02-12 06:45:46
Gavin has never opposed sidechains. He has shown qualified support for it, saying something along the lines 'if they can work, they'd be great'.
Sidechains and Bitcoin main scalability I believe are mutually complementary. A more scalable Bitcoin main will help bring mass adoption to Bitcoin, which will increase the value of any sidechain by increasing the potential userbase that can use it. No matter how much we want to scale Bitcoin main up, there *IS* a limit to its scalability, and at that point sidechains will take the additional load. But we need to get to the limits of Bitcoin main's scale, even though sidechains exist as an avenue to increase the Bitcoin ecosystem's scalability, because SC transactions are simply not as good as Bitcoin main transactions, even in theory (let alone practice). In terms of adding new functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem, sidechains will be beneficial no matter how scalable Bitcoin main is, because Bitcoin main cannot be hard forked to add every feature we may want. 
So I don't think the SC guys are looking at a more scalable Bitcoin main as a threat to demand for SCs, or at least I hope they're not. I really hope a &gt;16 MB block size limit and SC functionality are both implemented in Bitcoin main. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:54:28

Miners have a financial interest in making Bitcoin successful. In the past they have collaborated with the dev community to enact policies to limit bloat. There's no reason to assume they wouldn't in the future. It's in their interest.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:00:22
It's not "Satoshi-worship". It's adherence to "Bitcoin's mission", as set out in the white paper, and as discussed by many people over the years as Bitcoin has developed.
As bandwidth gets cheaper, there's no reason not to go in the direction of everyone being able to have high security and decentralization on every transaction. That doesn't require any decentralization to be sacrificed, as cheaper bandwidth necessarily means higher transaction throughput is possible at the same per-node cost (which is the only factor that promotes centralization).
Until the day everyone can put all of their transactions on the blockchain without leading to the centralization of Bitcoin, there will always be trade offs. That is what is bound to happen if we simply track the block size limit to the rate of broadband connection speed growth.
@_date: 2015-02-17 09:20:19
I think Bitcoin will exist for ever, if only as a curiosity maintained by tech historians. If it takes off, which I predict it will (contingent mostly on Gavin's hard fork proposal being implemented), I believe it will be relevant for centuries to come. Bloat will not be an issue in the future, as Moore's Law and its corollaries continue their march, and other issues can be fixed through changes to the protocol.
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:18:40
The actual trend has been that transaction fee revenue has increased with transaction volumes:
Despite blocks not being full and therefore no scarcity being created for block space by a limit.
More transactions per block would be good for miners, and that's why I suspect Gavin's proposal will get the requisite support from miners controlling 80% of the network hashrate quite quickly.
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:24:07
The potential appreciation we're looking at in Bitcoin at the moment is far beyond anything one would see in a normal (saturated market, no further adoption) deflationary economy. In other words, I don't think you can really compare someone holding bitcoin and expecting a possible 500% appreciation due to further adoption, and a 2% per year appreciation rate due to slight annual deflation. And there's the fact that bitcoin prices have recently dropped significantly. That's going to have different psychological effects than the value of the currency simply increasing every year, because in the latter case, spending your currency is not realizing a loss, it's realizing a gain.

The 1 MB block size restriction is an albatross that has to be lifted. It's artificially holding Bitcoin back from mass adoption. 
But I don't think it had a role to play in the case of Overstock's decision to consider multiple blockchains. I suspect the decision was more due to the lobbying of stakeholders in other cryptosecurity platforms, many of which I believe have seriously misrepresented these other platforms as being 'distributed' when in fact they depend on  the Proof of Stake based consensus protocol type, which a strong argument can be made is ultimately centralized due to its reliance on trusted third parties for security. 
Ironically, in their appeals for Medici to consider their platforms, they have criticized Proof of Work as being prone to centralization:

Yes for simplification I was omitting their profits. Their profits will trend toward a very thin margin, as mining is possibly the most competitive industry in the world.


Even assuming miners collude to maximize their revenue, it would be best for miners for total fee revenue to be as high as possible, and too high a minimum fee will reduce total fee revenue. The sweet spot is the highest fee that still allows Bitcoin to capture most of the world market for transactions. I assume that's quite a low fee.
Also, collusion might become difficult if Bitcoin miners come to have a dual-use as space heaters. More altruism could then enter the picture, as the revenue difference between a cartelized and non-cartelized mining industry for someone operating hashing space heater would be minimal. If over 50 percent of the network hashrate is controlled by people who want a free market in mining fees, and are willing to sacrifice mining revenue for it, then that's what it will be.

How can the government be as efficient as the private sector at anything, when it's not weeded out through competition? That would fly in the face of logic. 
What the government can do, that the private sector can't, is force everyone to pay for something. In some cases, I would argue this is necessary, which is why I'm not an anarchist. I don't, however, promote the idea that a monopolistic organization not subject to any real competition (sure it competes with other states, but barring invasion, it has a monopoly over its tax base, and sure its leaders have to compete with a few other individuals in elections, but that's pretty limited competition relative to what private companies are subjected to on a daily basis) is more efficient than the private sector.

They can do anything they want. If a group of people fork a SC, another group will likely remain on the original fork, and a two-convertible SC will continue to exist. Considering SCs make the most sense as merge-mined chains, I don't think that will happen often, as Bitcoin miners can just attack them.


But it's not "clearly superior to Bitcoin". A SC is an extension of Bitcoin, and a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The BTC people hold can unlock all of the features of the SCs, AND the features of the main chain. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

At 1 MB blocks, or 3 tps, mass adoption is not possible without end users having to use financial institutions as payment intermediaries. Once a decade is not enough per person. This is common sense.


It's not silly at all. It appears to follow a relatively steady trend, as do most technology performance metrics. 
Furthermore, the hard limit is not the only way to limit block sizes. If the hard limit ends up growing faster than broadband connection speeds, we can impose limits on the block size through other means.
A hard limit is the most crude and inflexible way to limit the block size. Protocol rules should not be used to try to limit blocks to just the right size. We have multiple other, much more flexible ways of doing that.

* They transfer Bitcoins on behalf of one person. This includes **Bitcoin tipping** (**mixers**, **Blockchain.info Send Shared**, ~~CoinJoin, **Dark Wallet** *(200.2n1)*~~
* They hold *or have control over* Bitcoins for their users. This includes **Mining pools**, **Coinbase**, **Circle**, **Greenaddress.it**, **all exchanges**. *(200.2n2)*
* They buy or sell Bitcoins as a business activity. This includes **Local Bitcoins sellers**, ** FinCEN statements includes selling physical coinage (including **casascius coins**) also regulated. *(200.2n3)* 
* ~~They create a virtual currency, even if it is decentralized. This includes **creating altcoins**. In fact, Satoshi would have commited a crime creating Bitcoin without registration. *(200.2n5)*~~
* They trade any virtual currency, even for another virtual currency. **This includes alt coin exchanges. Mintpal, Cryptsy, BTER, etc** *(200.2n4)*
.. to any resident in New York. Web services, even those incorporated overseas, must either comply or block access for NY users. *(200.2n)*
**Entities 'dealing in virtual currency' must:**
* Perform AML and collect identities, including **~~verification of~~ government issued Photo ID and proof of address**, and retain these information for ~~10~~ 7 years. *(200.15a)*. *Verification of identity required for any accountholder that initiates transaction with a value over $3,000*. 
* **Retain all transaction logs** for ~~10~~ 7 years, including **real name &amp;amp; physical addresses of ~~ALL parties of a transaction~~** *account holders* ~~- yes, including whoever you are sending to.~~ *(200.12a1)*
* Report all transactions over the USD value of ~~$3000~~ $10,000, and file Suspicious Activity Reports. *(200.15g4)*
* Maintain collateral in the form of ~~USD~~ *high quality, highly liquid, investment-grade assets*, including collateral for Bitcoin balances. The % as collateral is unspecified.
* ~~Retained earnings and profits of in invested in US dollars. **They may not keep any profit in Bitcoin.**~~ *(200.8b)*
* **Forfeit Bitcoins that are inactive for over 5 years** to the State of New York - *(200.12c)*
* Not obfuscate any transactions - **Bitcoin mixing would be illegal**. *(200.15f)*
* ***Must get prior written approval*** *for any plan or proposal

Even in a situation where the Bitcoin main chain is only a 'savings account', with sidechains handling retail transactions, people still need direct access to the main chain more than a couple times a month, and that requires a block size limit far higher than 1 MB under any mass adoption scenario.

It's a transaction that the author declares can't be spent. This is important because it won't be included in the 'unspent transaction' set, so regular nodes can prune it, saving them hard disc space. If you want to only encode information in the blockchain, as opposed to send BTC, encoding it in an OP_RETURN output is the best way to do it.
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:58:02
It can't be pruned from the blockchain by all nodes, because new nodes need it when validating the transaction record (they need to check every transaction, even if it ends up being a non-spendable transaction that they can prune).
Anyway, even if it could be pruned by all nodes (and I believe it would be good if certain transaction types existed that could), the block hash proves the OP_RETURN tx appeared in that block. The ability to prove existence of data at a certain time is the most important benefit of putting it in the blockchain.

The attack is not happening right now. The risk *IS* low and manageable for the time being. 


The Black Swan event is a few hundred merchants having small value items stolen from them, which is insignificant in the grand scheme of a large economy. And it might be years before that event occurs. It might never happen. To bring the risk of the Black Swan event, which is not particularly horrible, to zero, you want to eliminate a valuable method of transactions, right now, and deny thousands of people a chance to use it millions of times without incident.

There's an upper limit to what fees consumers will pay Bitcoin miners, because of traditional competitors and alternate blockchains. Bitcoin doesn't have a monopoly in payments. At some fee level, only increases in scale will increase total mining revenues and security.

The individual block size limit for block creation set by each miner. Miners coordinating to reduce this value has been a way to limit block size before (e.g. when they set it at 250 kb).
The minimum transaction value that will be relayed by default. This indirectly reduces the block size, because of the finite amount of BTC, making the maximum number of transactions that can be generated inversely proportional to the minimum allowable transaction value.
Various types of soft forks can limit the block size. The most straightforward would be a soft fork that has miners refuse to build on top of blocks exceeding a certain size. This would not be a protocol rule, but would act like one.

10MB blocks is only 16.67 KB/s. Assuming upload to four peers, that's 66.67 KB/s. A huge subset of home connections could handle that.


Yeah that's possible. If broadband connection speeds only increase by 25%/year in the next 20 years, we'd still be able to get ~3,000 tps (assuming 821 bytes/tx), which is about what Visa's average throughput is. This is still very good, and it is with extreme decentralization. We could sacrifice decentralization moderately (e.g. see full node numbers decline by 50%) and increase that. And it will only get better in years following.

For that the blockchain needs an incorruptible way of determining the price of bandwidth, so that it can track the block size limit to a constant market value of bandwidth.

My transactions with BTC happen in seconds. They're faster than debit/credit card transactions. I can see some hiccups for some people though, as Bitcoin is still a new technology, and wallet software hasn't been refined to deal with all contingencies (e.g. mobile phone can't connect to the WiFi, and therefore can't transmit the transaction - can be solved by directly transferring the transaction to the merchant's software via bluetooth/NFC), but it will, if it continues being developed.

So the banks handle the good stuff (gold), and everyone else has to make due with promissory notes. I'd rather the Bitcoin blockchain be accessible to the world, and not the exclusive purview of banks. If broadband connection speeds increase by the same proportion in the next 20 years as they did in the last 20, every person on earth will be able to generate one transaction a day on the Bitcoin blockchain, and have anyone with a high-end consumer broadband connection validate it using their full node.
Sidechains are very promising, but as a scalability solution they're completely untested. I don't think Bitcoin's scalability should rest on such a speculative experiment, or wait an indeterminate amount of time to see how it fares.

My model is the blockchain replacing bank accounts, and for that, I'm estimating every person needs to be able to access the blockchain once in somewhere between 1 and 10 days. I don't know the exact range, but I do know that if the access rate is once per year, then they will use conventional finance/banking instead, or if they're unbanked, remain so.
The block sizes required for a substantial portion of the world population to get one transaction every 1 - 10 days are not unthinkable. There's no proof the network couldn't handle them. So I do believe Bitcoin can scale to levels that give everyone meaningful access to the blockchain.

I wonder if it would be possible for a new node that's syncing up to validate the entire blockchain without ever putting the entire blockchain on their hard drive. For example, downloading 10% of blocks, find all spent transactions in that 10%, prune them, and then download 10% more, and go through the same process, until they have validated every transaction, and only have pruned transactions on their hard drive. That way no one would ever have to store the whole blockchain at any point during the initial sync. Archiving can be split up between nodes, e.g. each node stores 10% of pruned transaction for archiving purposes.

You called large block proponents "anti-decentralization proponents" in your very first mention of them. That is an unprovoked, aggressive smear against anyone who believes Bitcoin can have large blocks while preserving its core security properties like decentralization, which goes for every single large block proponent I've encountered in this subreddit. It makes me think there is a very high likelihood that I'm dealing with a sockpuppet.


That at some larger block size, this could happen, does not mean that large block proponents are "anti-decentralization proponents". It's possible to support a larger block size, and that size not be so large that it limits running nodes to "actors who want to control transactions for ulterior motives". The rationale you've provided for calling them "anti-decentralization proponents" is exceedingly poor, and makes me suspect more strongly that I'm dealing with a sockpuppet.

I see you've created a new account &gt;Permissioned ledgers have "enough throughput" to scale to mass adoption levels.
Permissioned ledger!????
Yes, Visa and other permissioned ledgers provide enough throughput for mass adoption levels. But we don't want permissioned ledgers like Visa. A permissioned ledger is a regulated ledger.. 


Bitcoin cannot provide the masses with decentralized money unless it can provide the masses with direct blockchain access. Permissioned ledgers have formed a regulated financial sector, and nothing will change by introducing OpenTransactions permissioned ledgers. Only holding your own money, on the blockchain, accessible with your own private key, will give a person access to a decentralized financial system.


A $20 transaction fee would mean anyone earning less than $10 a day, which is 70 percent of the world population, would never use the blockchain. No one is going to pay a $20 fee for a single transaction when they earn less than $300 a month.
One of the most important things about the planned LN is that if a LN node you're connected to starts to screw around, you can close your payment channel with them and create a new payment channel with another node. However, if it costs $20 to close the channel, it means that the LN peer can hold your money hostage, since the amount you lose from working with them has to exceed $20 for it to be worth it for you to close the channel.
In other words, $20 transaction fees means the LN will not be a flexible, censorship-proof network where you can easily change which nodes you're connected to in order to find the cheapest, most censorship proof connections.
High tx fees will mean it will be an expensive to join and inflexible network, where you're often stuck with the LN peers you connect to for a long time, even if they misbehave, because you have to pay a significant financial penalty to switch peers.
What you propose is inconsistent with a decentralized, censorship proof, and universally accessible financial system. Your vision would do great harm to Bitcoin if heeded, and frankly, I have trouble believing you don't know that.

I'd only disagree with the notion that it's not an acute problem. It's an acute problem precisely because waiting until the limit is hit will be too late to avoid some serious inconvenience and reputation damage (people not getting their transactions confirmed hurts Bitcoin's image). Unless there's a sense of urgency, the hard fork won't happen until that happens, and that's doing it too late IMO. I'm not saying everything will shut down and Bitcoin will die, just that not hard forking before the limit is hit is a pretty big mistake, and worth raising the alarm about.
More important than avoiding a hard-limit/txs-not-confirming crisis, is giving the Bitcoin economy a clear plan for expansion. Without knowing what exactly will happen with the hard limit, and when, the confidence in Bitcoin's future is diminished. The hard limit, and the lack of a plan for it, is a major source of uncertainty in my opinion.

Not with Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT). The bandwidth required to propagate new blocks declines dramatically once it starts being used. If IBLT wasn't in place, blocks would never get that big in the first place, as miners would refuse to generate block of a size that increases the risk that their block gets orphaned.
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:25:15
Keep in mind, blocks are only 500 KB right now, yet the block size limit has been at 1 MB for the last 6 years. Meaning, there is no reason to assume blocks will reach the 20 MB limit just because the hard limit is there. The hard limit would be raised simply to give us the *flexibility* to have larger blocks if the need arises. If we find that blocks are getting larger, and it's detrimental to the network, there are many ways to limit the block size, long before they reach the 20 MB hard limit.

Txs drop out of the pool after some time. You need eventual confirmation or the tx will be canceled. At a certain average txs throughput, a percentage of txs will continuously be canceled due to insufficient space in blocks. There is also no guarantee that the current behavior of rejecting double spends of unconfirmed txs will continue to be followed by all miners. I think it's likely, but it's not a guarantee.

Bitcoin won't be used as the ledger for any global industry with 3 tps. Bitcoin can and should scale to thousands of tps. Broadband connection speeds will likely be exponentially greater in 20 years so there's no reason not to remove the (temporary) anti-spam hard limit, as originally intended, so it can scale to make use of that.

I would go with Gavin's 16.8 MB, and doubling every two years after that (40% per year), up to a maximum of 16 GB 20 years from now. If it was entirely up to me, I'd probably raise it to the same 16.8 MB, and then grow it up by a smaller percentage every year (e.g. 25%). However, I haven't studied bandwidth growth rates closely enough to know for certain what the right rate of increase is. 
Whatever it is, I'm not overly concerned with a 'too-high' block size limit, as there are multiple mechanisms in place already that prevent blocks from getting too large, other than a hard limit at the protocol level. Thus far in Bitcoin's history we've seen that blocks don't get as big as the hard limit permits: the limit has been 1 MB for five years, and blocks are still only 0.5 MB. And if the hard limit turns out to be high, AND the other mechanisms fail to impose reasonable limits on the block size, a soft limit can be imposed by miners, that would be enforced as if it were a hard limit. So whether the hard limit grows by 25% or 40% every year, is not a big deal IMO.
Anyway, the current proposal would leave enough space for thousands of transactions per second in twenty years, which will be enough for mass adoption.

Yes I assume that, because they would see that the payment has not confirmed in the next block. That would ring the alarm. Fortunately, confirmations happen in 10 minutes on average, which means there it's a very short period of time before they find out.
And I assume that if zero-conf double spends begin to happen frequently, news would spread like wildfire, and other merchants, who had not been affected by one of these thefts, would also stop accepting zero-conf txs. I simply can't see why this would such a major concern to people that they would want to actively reduce the security of double spends and make them as difficult to accept as possible. Let people deal with double spends themselves, with the current double spend settings in place in the default software.


People in shops are always given an orientation when they begin, and they pay attention to things like how many confirmations you need before you can assume a transaction to be secure. Guidelines like 'zero-confs can be reversed, but to date, we have not seen thieves bother to reverse low-value transactions in brick and mortar shops, so they're probably safe for small purchases', are easy to follow, and would guide them to behave in a prudent manner.

Unless Bitcoin main becomes permanently capped at 1 MB of transaction data, there is no possibility of this happening in my opinion. There are several reasons for this:
* Sidechains with two-way convertibility are architecturally less secure than the main chain, which will make Bitcoin transactions more highly demanded, and therefore increasing fees on Bitcoin main.
* All Sidechain miners will be mining Bitcoin main by default, while not all Bitcoin miners will be mining every Sidechain. This will give Bitcoin main a much higher network hashrate and security than any Sidechain. 
* As a consequence of the Bitcoin-Sidechain architecture, Bitcoin main will be centrally situated in the Bitcoin-Sidechain ecosystem, acting as a hub between sidechains, and therefore making Bitcoin main blockchain space more sought after than Sidechain space, and making the transaction fees earned from mining the main chain greater than mining any single Sidechain.

I believe it often is, because there is no counterparty in a decentralized system. Coinbase, which I keep picking on, has legal liabilities as a counterparty, and thus is forced by regulations to spy on its users' spending habits. In some cases, yes, centralized payment processors have an advantage, like with Changetip. I think that as long as the Bitcoin blockchain offers strong competition to centralized payment intermediaries, and a means for users to cheaply deposit/withdraw their BTC to and from their e-wallets, then these intermediaries will be quite good. If Bitcoin main gets expensive to directly use, then we're back to a trust-based network of banks, and central points of failure where regulations, crafted by banking insiders, can be applied.


I don't propagate that it's just a decentralized payment network. It's also a distributed electronic currency, and more importantly, consensus protocol.


Let me rephrase that: The only reason bitcoin is valued is that people speculate it will become money that you can spend without intermediaries and with very low fees.

Using the Bitcoin P2P network as a retail payment network is feasible:
1. In theory, near instant blockchain confirmations can be had by incorporating orphaned shares in the weighing of the difficulty of a fast share (e.g. 1 second) chain, to eliminate the latency penalty of fast block times (ala the GHOST protocol), and with heuristics to prevent miners from double spending transactions with more than a threshold number of shares built on top of it.
2. In the meantime, the past behaviour of pools is a reliable indicator of their likelihood of accepting double spends, and can be leveraged to allow instant txs. Right now they're not allowing double spends, so a propagation confirmation gives a spender high confidence that their tx will not be double spent.
3. Instant small value txs in person are relatively safe even if double spends are possible before a block confirmation, because of social and possible legal repercussions of double spending against a merchant you paid face-to-face. This is the same reason a cashier doesn't check whether every $10 bill they receive isn't a counterfeit. Right now, the reality is that people do instant 0-confirmation Bitcoin transactions, with nothing lost to double spend theft. This proves it's possible, no matter what the theory says.
4. Bitcoin main can be made as scalable and safe for instant transactions as possible without harming efforts to find off-chain and sidechain solutions to scalabiliy. Bitcoin main's scalability doesn't need to be handicapped to force these alternate avenues to increase scalability and settlement speed. Bitcoin main scalability and off/sidechain scalability likely complement each other.


Why does consensus have to take time? Why 10 minutes? The network is generating trillions of proofs of work per millisecond, and PoW travels at the speed of light across the globe.

Any arbitrary number of micropayments between two parties are settled by two on-chain transactions, so a billion off-chain micropayments only cost two txs worth of on-chain data.

Assessing risk and getting an accurate gauge on it does not, ever, let you predict with certainly whether you will suffer a loss. I have no idea what you take risk assessment to mean.


No one does large value 0-conf transactions, unless they're totally ignorant about security. The common practice is 0-conf at point of sale for none-huge value transactions. It's working so far. A mass attack would have to involve a huge number of people going to brick and mortar stores and doing a grand heist to steal small value items. It could only happen once, and then Bitcoin would wise up to it. I personally think the attack would never happen. Even if it does, it's worth the losses that would come from that one 'mass attack', to have 1, 2, 3 years of instant 0-conf point of sale transactions.

As long as Bitcoin becomes a high-value inter-bank transfer system, then yes, it can handle a "practically unlimited number of payments per second", but then people have to go through financial institutions to access the blockchain and to transact with each other, eliminating the peer-to-peer aspect of Bitcoin, and defeating its whole purpose.


That might never happen. Bitcoin might very well be replaced if the 1 MB block size limit is reached and new users cannot use the blockchain. Running a scarcity experiment at this stage in Bitcoin's history, when it should be pursuing rapid adoption, and when there is plenty of spare capacity in consumer broadband to handle larger blocks, is dangerous, and totally unnecessary.

Ideally everyone in the world would be able to run a full node, but in reality we have other considerations, like number of transactions the Bitcoin ledger can process per second, that conflict with this goal. If some people having to turn off their full nodes is the price of having more than 3 tx/sec, I say it's worth it. You can run a Simple Payment Verification light client like Multibit, that gives you pretty good security, and control over your own private keys, without the resource load of a full node.

What's wrong with Bitcoin being complicated? Why is it being simple necessarily better? 
The idea behind Bitcoin's fee discovery is that individual miners and individual users negotiate fees independently, and no central planner controls and standardizes the process. 
You're suggesting that "maybe" is not good enough. Why is maybe not good enough for zero/low fee transactions? How does zero/low fee transactions taking longer on average to confirm mean that users can't determine "which fee is required for it go through"? Obviously a high enough fee will all but guarantee their transaction will get into the very next block, and obviously this can be calculated automatically through blockchain analysis of previous txs, their block inclusion times, and their fees/size ratios, by their wallet software.


How much storage and bandwidth? How expensive would it be? Why is it "too expensive"?

Yelp has a far lower standard of accuracy to meet, as a quality, rather than safety, certifier. In any case, I've found it to be immensely helpful in selecting vendors. It's even helped me avoid restaurants with poor food safety practices, namely a few sushi places that the reviews said had left their patrons sick. This was a case of a business getting through regulatory checks but being identified as suspect by a market certifier.
A better example of a non-governmental certifier would be the Dolphin Safe label. For countries outside of the US, adherence to this standard is verified by the Earth Island institute:
A for profit equivalent would be a gold authenticity certifiers, like [Independent Gold Graders]( which provides 'certified gold' hi-tech tamper resistant seals, and has a large financial incentive to be accurate in its gold grading, given the business' reliance on having a reputation for credible grading.
In the absence of government run food safety certification, high quality food safety certifiers would undoubtedly arise, as they have in precious metal and gem grading.


That assumes it has a larger financial incentive to not have quality problems reported and dealt with, in order to protect contracts with lower-cost suppliers, than to develop a long-term reputation for food safety and quality.
A case of fatal food poisoning can destroy a business. It almost shut down Jack in the Box. They reacted by putting in place the HACCP system for food safety control:
 
No one has a greater incentive to assure quality than a company reliant on its brand for business. 
The importance of being perceived to be using quality ingredients has driven McDonalds to launch a marketing campaign to be more transparent about how it makes and prepares its food:
This is not proof that McDonalds uses quality ingredients and food preparation practices, but it does show the importance its management places on having a reputation for food quality. And you know what really screw that up for them? The customers getting food poisoning.. 
People, as consumers, are every bit as concerned about the quality of their food as the government agencies that purport to represent them, and it is clear to me that in the absence of state-backed monopolies handling food safety certification, the importance consumers place on food safety would create a vibrant market in credible private and NGO food safety certification.

There are many mechanisms, other than the hard limit, by which the block size is restrained. The existence of these other checks on block size, some of which are already in use, is why I think we should have a high hard limit. These are other checks are why despite the hard limit being 1 MB for the last 6 years, blocks still only average 0.5 MB. 
It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that if Gavin's geometrically rising &gt;16 MB hard limit proposal is implemented, and broadband connection speeds fail to keep up with its increase, that we will end up with blocks that are too big, given the core developers and miners have these other tools at their disposal to limit block size growth. 
A hard protocol rule is the crudest and most dangerous way to get 'just the right block size', because it is so hard to quickly change (even perhaps impossible in the future), if we see an urgent need.
Regarding the responsive block size limit:


The problem with this is that it can be gamed. In any case, there is nothing stopping us from having this imposed as a soft fork, that is enforced as if it were a hard protocol rule, while still having the &gt;16 MB hard limit in place as a fail safe.

There *IS* in fact a limit to how big block sizes can get in a distributed currency. It's just far higher than 1 MB.

Good summary of developments.
With regard to a public awareness campaign. My only concern is that it's done, and then the 1 MB block size limit is hit. It's a hard limit, so it can't be changed quickly. Last time the soft limit was hit (at 250 KB), there were long delays to get confirmations, and widespread dissatisfaction. Fortunately, it was a soft limit and it was raised relatively quickly. An extended period of space shortage, due blocks coming up against the hard limit, could lead to Bitcoin's reputation being damaged. 
In this line, it's very encouraging to see headers first synchronization launched in 0.10, as it's part of the changes that will make larger blocks less costly to handle, and make raising the hard limit more practical. But until the hard fork happens, public awareness campaigns carry some risk.

Such a law is equivalent to a ban on Bitcoin. It's dangerous because it might not appear to everyone that it is a ban - though it would be because Bitcoin is defined by its fungibility which this law would ban - and therefore wouldn't be resisted by all of the parties that would otherwise resist the passage of a law banning Bitcoin. I think whether such a ban can succeed depends on the Bitcoin community. If the majority choose to play ball, and obey the anti-fungibility law, then it would succeed. If the majority engage in civil disobedience and continue using Bitcoin, as opposed to the centralised imposter that the new law creates, then the law will fail.
In terms of whether Bitcoin can be banned globally, no I don't think so. I think there will always be countries where it is legal.

Transaction channels are very useful in my opinion. They allow microtransactions at practically zero cost and no marginal blockchain bloat. However, they're not a total solution, and can't fully substitute on-chain transactions. First of all, they are terrible at privacy.

What is it about big banks, which operate under tons of regulatory redtape, that causes them to get caught up in financial bubbles and crashes?

Thanks for taking the time to respond. I think cryptocurrencies like litecoin and dogecoin are near clones of Bitcoin, just with a different name, and a couple superficial technical changes, to hide that fact.
I believe that the digital scarcity of this new distributed digital currency asset class is worth defending, until which time the network effect of Bitcoin is strong enough that it doesn't need any active support from the community to persist, and I believe not embracing clones that don't introduce any innovation is part of that.
The decisions we make, on seemingly ideological questions, can shape the future of technology and the likelihood of cryptocurrency achieving mass adoption. If the Bitcoin community, early on, had embraced clones of Bitcoin, I believe the entire concept of cryptocurrency would have failed to gain any credibility, and the industry and technology wouldn't have come as far as they did.
I've seen indications of this first hand. I was talking to a youngish business owner about him accepting bitcoin about a year ago, and he said after he saw dogecoin get traction on Reddit, during the Jamaican bobsled team fundraiser, he dismissed the idea that currencies like Bitcoin could ever become serious contenders in the world of money, because it appeared that the top one could always be replaced by copy riding a fad. His comment somewhat confirmed my suspicion that clones of Bitcoin, that rely on nothing but marketing to create the illusion of being original/unique, are not good for the credibility and adoption of cryptocurrency.
In any case, you're building usable technology, and that's more important for Bitcoin than promoting a cultural aversion to clones that threaten its digital scarcity, so thank you for that and I wish you well.

They are in a position to steal your money directly, as a cartel. Doing it as a cartel doesn't mean they're not doing it directly. The fact that they collectively form a cartel that can steal your money makes them a permissioned ledger. Just like the Alpha and Liquid sidechains, which have multiple signers, that must all collude to steal your money. Blockstream defines both of these SCs as permissioned ledgers, because they don't lie like you do.

This is really much less important than anyone, anywhere in the world, being able to independently move value on the ledger.
More block space = more independent control of value on ledger.
Less block space = more independent validation of ledger.
Given the latter can be substituted with polling any number of independent semi-trusted parties all around the world, while the former is impossible to do securely without being able to do it independently, it makes more sense to err on the side of more block space.

You'll need thousands of blockchains to meet the world's demand, if each is limited to 1 MB blocks. This would never happen because that many blockchains with independent currencies would make cryptocurrency too volatile and fragmented to achieve mass adoption.

So you're totally wrong on one count, and mostly wrong on another.
You're totally wrong about the white paper not saying anything about people doing transactions without intermediaries. The white paper says the purpose is to allow people to make p2p electronic cash transfers without intermediaries. People having to use intermediaries to use the blockchain's p2p electronic cash is not "without intermediaries", naturally.
You're mostly wrong about a "billion people". It's not in the white paper, but when he released the white paper, it was followed by an exchange of emails, and in those emails, he set out his vision for thousands of tps, which comes to (tens, hundreds of) millions or over a billion people directly using the blockchain, so it's effectively the same as being in the white paper in terms of the stated mission of Bitcoin.


Electronic cash without intermediaries did not exist until the blockchain was invented. That's why Bitcoin was such an important invention. Using an intermediary to do electronic cash means it's not p2p. You're pushing to convince people to accept your third-party-mediated/non-p2p-money so hard, but no one is going to buy it.

The legitimacy comes with venture capital funding from reputable investors, not from strong-arming regulations that threaten to imprison an entrepreneur in Spain because a person from New York happened to use their Bitcoin e-wallet when they weren't licensed with the state of New York. I don't think you're considering how broadly applicable these laws will be, both in types of Bitcoin services affected, and in geographical scope.
Coinbase would be just as secure and legitimate without regulations. It's the security practices it has put in place (e.g. cold storage of customer funds), that it was not required by any regulations to put in place, the financial backing it has, and the reputation of those backing it, that make it legitimate, not any set of regulations. The only thing regulations do is force it to spy on its users' spending habits and close their accounts if they are deemed to be spending on unapproved services (e.g. gambling).

If encryption is banned and only a small number of people use it, law enforcement can investigate those people, and catch the criminals that are using it. If it's legal and everyone uses it, law enforcement cannot investigate everyone that uses it because there will be too many, so criminals that use it won't be caught.
A better argument against bans on encryption is how are people going to protect themselves from criminals if they don't have encryption. Network security is already atrociously bad. With back-doored encryption, it gets even worse.

Because it costs money to create a global cryptocurrency infrastructure (branding, exchanges, service providers, market cap).

Number 3, 5 and 6 are Bitcoin forks.  Ripple, has a questionable market cap figure, given how low of a percentage of its total currency stock is out in the market and tradeable, and how much of an interest Ripple Inc. has to keep the price artificially high through its intervention.

The longest chain is much less important than what network the economic majority is on.

Displaying more payment options can reduce total sales. This is why a website's Bitcoin sales need to hit a certain target for it to be profitable to keep Bitcoin as a payment option. PayPal has a huge userbase so it would make sense that accepting PayPal would be more profitable than accepting Bitcoin for most websites. Unless Bitcoin achieves the critical mass of users to make accepting Bitcoin generally profitable, it will often not be a profitable business decision for merchants to accept it.
Merchants that do accept Bitcoin have to be serving the right audience, and properly promote the fact that they accept it, in order to benefit. This is an example of a company that does both:

It's to prevent two things really:

If the merge-mined chains are altcoins rather than sidechains, then there's no reason to believe that one of these chains wouldn't simply replace the presumably expensive to use Bitcoin blockchain as the store of wealth chain, and no reason the Bitcoin miners wouldn't find it in their interest to attack these coins through a &gt;50% attack. Sidechains would thus be much more likely and more secure.


It's not speculation, it's math. Assuming widespread adoption, a 1 MB restriction only allows each person to access the Bitcoin blockchain once a decade.


A Bitcoin that only big banks can afford to use is not what I want. If that's what you want, then we have fundamentally different ideas of what Bitcoin should become.


Why the name calling? This is an analysis that shows Bitcoin can't achieve mass adoption without people having to use large financial intermediaries to access the blockchain. Just because these facts don't conform to your preconceived ideas doesn't make them "fear mongering".

The cost to operate the network is dependent on the cost to produce the proof of work. The amount of proof of work produced, and the cost to produce proof of work, varies. This means the cost operate the network is not fixed. Moreover, miners cannot dictate the fee, since they are competing with each other, and can be undercut if they charge more than what other miners can bear. We would hope that the resources used to operate the network remain high in the future, as that means a more secure network, but that will depend on the market demand for Bitcoin transactions.

OP_RETURN transactions will still be stored by some nodes when pruning is implemented. They have to be so that new nodes can download the entire blockchain and validate it when syncing up.

Bitcoin is not like gold, because it doesn't inherently have credible scarcity. Bitcoin's market gap grew from nothing to something with expectations of demand for its currency, and the security of its market position versus clones, increasing with its growth as a transactional currency. Your confidence in Bitcoin's market position, in claiming that it can be just like gold with no other sources of demand for it other than demand as a store of wealth, is dangerous for Bitcoin.


Once again you promote false notions. Bitcoin as a payment currency is an essential part of the Winklevi's valuation:


Roger Ver is one of the biggest holders and he wants mass consumer adoption. When Bitcoin was starting out and also when it was going through its astronomical appreciation phase, the rationale provided by those who took large positions was that it would become a widely used currency for payments with a throughput of thousands of txs per second. You can read old posts on forums and see that this was by far the most common sentiment among those bullish on Bitcoin. 
You'd have to want Bitcoin to fail to want to degrade its ability as a payment system.

If all of these things are possible without the blockchain, then we wouldn't need Bitcoin.

The profitability argument is also based on the groundless assumption that you need scarcity created by a limit to see transaction fee revenue increase. The actual trend has been that transaction fee revenue has increased with transaction volumes:
Despite blocks not being full and therefore no scarcity being created for block space by a limit.
Also, there's an upper limit to what fees consumers will pay Bitcoin miners per tx, because of traditional competitors and alternate blockchains. Bitcoin doesn't have a monopoly in payments. At some fee level, only increases in scale will increase total mining revenues and security. 
So if you want miners to earn more fees, you have every reason to support not making the 1 MB anti-spam restriction into a permanent limit, and supporting Gavin's &gt;16 MB / block proposal.

Replace-by-fee for the specific purpose of reversing mistaken transaction within the ave of 10 minutes that it takes for the first confirmation will be very rarely used, for multiple reasons (e.g. checksum, the new payment protocol, etc make sending to the wrong address less likely). Right now, zero-conf txs are extensively used, and you're only speculating that they won't in the future. The case for not making replace-by-fee that allow double spends of zero-conf txs default is very strong.

It's manipulative, using harm as the method of manipulation. It's deliberately degrading a mechanism for payment that people like me like to use, which disregard my own preferences. I find it harmful to the ecosystem and inappropriate in its assumption that one has a right to make that decision for others. You know, we can disagree on whether zero-conf txs are safe in select situations, without you forcing me to stop using zero-conf txs.


They are relatively safe in select situations. This is a debate about degrees of safety, and for how long they remain relatively safe for a select type of commercial exchange.

Well your guess is as good as mine. All I know is that I only began spending at Overstock after they began accepting Bitcoin. Same with CheapAir.com. And Overstock's stock price has gone up since they started taking it.
In general though I'd say that accepting Bitcoin is about consumer-facing businesses positioning themselves for possible future growth in Bitcoin, rather than increasing their sales in the short term. In the short term, innovative uses of Bitcoin that traditional currencies / payment processors don't allow is where the opportunity is, i.e. Bank-to-Bank wire transfer, Changetip, zero trust micropayment channels for incremental content purchase at untrusted sites, etc.

Wrong, they can properly be called workarounds for not having a hard limit to restrain too large block sizes. 


Yes, the effectiveness is proportional to what percentage of the network hashrate that miners who support the measure control. In the case of a soft fork, miners that control &gt;50% of the network hashrate need to support it for it to be enforced on all miners.


This is simply false. You don't know the definition of "electronic cash", or what it means to transact without financial intermediaries.

I don't think it follows that just because it's the most secure against confiscation and double spends, it'll be a widely store of value. The market will look at more than its security to value it. It'll consider potential competition from other cryptocurrencies that attain more transactional demand it for example. It'll consider the possibility that a competitor attaining more transactional volume than Bitcoin will earn more miner fees than Bitcoin, and therefore become more secure.
Bitcoin's biggest challenge to becoming a store of value is for it to secure its position against potential competition. The best way it can do that is to become a major transactional currency. Demand for BTC as a transactional currency can augment speculative demand, increase miner fees (and thus security), and secure its dominant market share.

Adoption numbers can grow exponentially. Transaction volumes can increase 10 fold in a matter of a few months. It has happened before. And if that happens, the limit will be hit with very little warning without ample time for discussion, and if at that point, the decision is made to do a hard fork, it might take time for the hard fork to actually be implemented, and in the mean time many customers and merchants will be unable to get their transactions confirmed.
On the other hand, if the limit is hit, the urgency to do a hard fork would be greater, so it might be rolled out more quickly than previous hard forks. So maybe it won't end up being too bad of a problem. In this scenario, the hard limit being hit would be comparable to when the 250 KB soft limit was hit when it was resolved relatively quickly (though not without bitcoin users being inconvenienced first).
In any case, no one knows for certain, so it's something to be concerned about, and I'd rather the hard fork be done sooner, rather than waiting for a critical situation to emerge where people can't get txs confirmed.

The determinism would come from the BIP-style expression of limit preference. The client could say something like: 
    The miner expressed limit value preference according to the last 12000 found blocks is 3000000 bytes (3 MB). Unless a recall is issued, miners will switch to this limit in 4000 blocks (block 382149, estimated to be found on November 6, 2015). To switch your personal block size limit to this value, click here. To leave your personal block size limit unchanged and not see this message again, click here.
And a recall could be some mechanism for miners to cancel a scheduled block size limit change, via enough blocks expressing an intent to recall during the confirmation period.
The failure scenario is if miners don't express a recall in a situation where a significant portion of the network refuses to conform to the miners' block size limit preference.


Right now, end users have basically zero power over the block size limit. With this in place, even if for the most part, a small group of people decide the limit, end users have slightly more than zero power.

If the SC is superior in every way, then people will just 'move' their BTC into the SC. The Bitcoin blockchain won't be holding BTC holders back in any way. And if that really does happen, it's very likely Bitcoin main will be hard forked to adopt all of the features of the SC.
I believe the most probable outcome will be that the main chain will still have some features that benefit BTC holders, and so it will continue to be to their advantage to be part of the larger ecosystem that includes both the main chain and the SC, rather than just one of the protocols.

On chain transactions have the potential to be extremely private. Several methods of de-linking one's spendable outputs from each other can be used, that don't rely on the discretion and integrity of any third party.


So a hub would pay you to lock up its capital for an outgoing channel to you? I don't quite follow. I do realize that users would lend to each other, and this would create competitive fees.

Well, there are currently [100,000 accepting merchants]( At an average of 2.88 tx/day per merchant, the 1 MB block size limit would be hit:
 ((1 MB/block * 144 blocks/day * 1 tx/0.5 KB)/100000 merchants = 2.88 txs/merchants * day). Unless a comprehensive micropayment channel network has developed by that time, the rest of the txs would have to be done on the ledgers of bitbanks, which are extremely centralised and points of regulation.

It's a tenuous assumption. I'll quote &gt;My experience of (centralized) financial systems over many years is that ignoring hardware and software constraints as they are approached invariably causes outages. Also, that trying to train a user-base or worse, a market, to behave differently to accommodate IT constraints is a Sisyphean task. There are probably hundreds of IT experts who are concerned about the block size limit, because they can see the risks in it, which they recognize from prior (usually bitter) experience.


And we've seen the harm of a soft limit before. When the 250 kB soft limit was hit, there were widespread complaints and dissatisfaction with long delays for txs getting confirmed.
Luckily it was a soft limit and it could be lifted relatively quickly. There are so many things that could go wrong when a hard limit is hit.
The assumption that we can restrain block size growth if we find that it's outpacing people's broadband connection speeds has been validated by experience. Several deliberate and coordinated dev/mining community measures have restrained the block size in the past, including the 250 KB soft limit.
Your argument that it's better to risk a too low hard limit than a too high one has no legs to stand on IMO.


Bitcoin's mission statement is to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash that allows people to transfer money without going through a financial intermediary. Any limit that prevents the average person from directly accessing the blockchain necessarily requires financial intermediaries.

Bitcoin simply cannot achieve mass adoption with a 1 MB block size limit, even as a gold substitute that is not used in retail transactions. It's a comically low limit, and there is no compelling argument for making it permanent.

A governing body forces everyone to abide by its decision, whether they like it or not. There's no justification for a governing body to be formed to intrude itself in people's consumer decisions. 
What makes an organisation credible is reputation. It's the same reason some IT certifications are more credible than others. People can come up with any number of ways to prove their organization reputable. For example, if they hire a renowned former professor of toxicology, specializing in food borne diseases, as their CEO, their credibility would immediately go up. A non-governmental body would develop its credibility in exactly the same way as a governing body.
And unlike a governing body, they would have to compete with each other, meaning only the very best would dominate the market, and a result, consumers would be better served.
The idea that if someone is appointed by the government, they are magically more competent and credible is a dangerous fallacy, that you appear to subscribe to.

I've spent a lot of time trying to think of a way for the blockchain to automatically derive the price of bandwidth, as I assume many others have.
The best I could come up with is miners setting 1) the average global price of bandwidth in their local currency, and 2) the global market price of bitcoin in their local currency, into their client, and their client automatically deriving the average global BTC price of bandwidth (this would standardize everything in terms of BTC prices, rather than some fiat value proxy like USD or EUR), and then their client participating a Shelling Point vote to determine a single BTC price of bandwidth, that the network uses to set the block limit and even minimum transaction fees.
But people don't want to give miners that much power to control a network parameter, and I understand this concern, so we're left with a fixed geometric hard limit growth rate.
Keep in mind that it's possible to impose a soft limit that uses some alternate mechanism, like what I proposed above, in conjunction with a fail-safe hard limit, like what Gavin has proposed. We're not stuck with blocks reaching whatever the hard limit is. The hard limit is just the absolute maximum, and we can set a soft limit that's less than it.

You wouldn't simply be counting, using some automated method, how many nodes accept some limit, to determine how widely supported that limit is. Of course that would easily be Sybil attacked, and therefore not a trusted method of gauging how widely supported a limit is.
In a setting where users can easily set their own limit, there would be a strong incentive for users to get an accurate gauge of what limit the economic majority supports, and conform their limit to that, because if they fail, they'll be partitioned off of the network, and be subject to the risk of significant financial loss. They would therefore find reliable indicators of what limit most real users support, like social cues, and base their judgment on those.

Of course they can advertise, and their political masters have an incentive to advertise. There are governmental and political  advertisements trumpeting the success of government/regulatory efforts all of the time.


The business consequence of failing. The consequences are much more dire for any large certification brand if their certification fails to prevent a case of fatal food poisoning. Your question contains with it an implication that only a central authority can influence and shape behaviour, which is not matched by the experience of existing markets, that shows market incentives have powerful effects on the development of industries.


There's nothing wrong with trading a microscopic increase in the risk of death from a particular cause for more economic resources to be spent in other fields. If $1 billion is saved as a result of moving to a market based system, and that market based system results in 2 additional deaths a year from food poisoning, that very likely means the market based system means fewer people dying from all causes, as the $1 billion would be spent in other areas that would result in fewer lives lost from other causes.
Questions of cost vs risk should be dealt with by consumers, with their superior crowd-based decision making that is based on the fluid combination of many sources of localized information, and not by central planners, relying on systemic information and setting out to solve problems through the creation of a mono-culture.


Every industry is different. What they all share in common is that where there's a demand for something, and a profit motive to meet that demand, people are incredibly motivated in finding innovative ways of effectively meeting that demand. A reputation for credibility is valuable in the market, and is something that will generally drive companies with strong brands to act with integrity and with the best interest of the consumer at heart.


Well yes, that goes without saying. The government can force companies to comply. A market with voluntary interactions relies on incentives to develop voluntary mutually beneficial relationships. If there's a demand for certification at points higher up in the supply chain, then the market will eventually come to provide it, in more innovative and ultimately effective ways than a monopoly. That's what we see now, with things like Fair Trade certification, where people have some assurance that the supply chain does not include companies that engage in practices that have particular environmental and labour impacts.


What advantage would an uncertified farmer have? If consumers want food safety, and are willing to pay in higher food prices and taxes for it (as presumably they do if they vote for governments that create regulatory agencies), why wouldn't they pay more in the market for food certified to be safe?


I'm assuming you didn't understand my comment. I made a point that Bitcoin would have no chance of achieving mass adoption had there been regulations on it early on. Are you saying that's a price worth paying to have prevented people losing money depositing money at MtGox?

Maybe to you. I see meaning in the data. Zero-conf txs have been accepted for years, including for the last while, when there has an average of 100,000 thousand txs a day. There are now 100,000 merchants that accept Bitcoin, and likely tens of thousands of those are brick and mortar merchants which accept zero-conf txs. With all of that activity that this data suggests is occurring, there has yet to be any reports of brick and mortar being stolen from through double spend attacks. 
That means there has been a very low 'crime rate', for a very long time. Following long-established trend lines is a common way to assess risk. I judge the risk of something happening any time soon to be low.

Gavin's proposal is to move immediately to ~16.8 MB block size limit, and then double it every two years, for 20 years, at which point it will be 17.18 GB. At that limit, Bitcoin could let every person in the world use the blockchain every day.

I also floated the idea of a 'block fee', except I had the block fee the miner of block N pays claimed by the miner of block N+25. This was to prevent certain subversions where a miner claims their own block fee when they mine a certain number of blocks consecutively.
In my proposal, miners input two values into their mining client: the price of BTC in their local currency and the price of bandwidth in their local currency. With these two values, the client calculates the cost of bandwidth in BTC. This single value is then encoded in any block they generate, and at the end of each difficulty period, a new network value for the 'bandwidth/BTC' is determined, using the values inputted in the preceding 2016 blocks, either through a Schelling Point vote, or a decrement/increment mechanism (e.g. every block is a vote for either increasing or decreasing the value by some fixed tiny percentage point, and at the end of the difficulty period, the net votes for either an increase or decrease determine the direction and proportion of change in the network price of bandwidth/BTC). A variation on the increment/decrement proposal was to make the mechanisn modify a difficulty:price ratio, rather than directly modify the network price, and have the difficulty be the direct deteminant of network price, based on the miner determined ratio. The rationale for this would be that difficulty often tracks the real world price, and thus having the network price track difficulty might reduce the need for intervention by miners.
This price for bandwidth would then be multiplied by some magic number that we hardcode, to approximate the number of full node miners we think we need (e.g. 1000), to determine the amount that each kB of transaction data in a block contributes to the mandatory block fee that the block's generator pays forward. This way, miners who generate larger blocks are paying for the bandwidth that other miners are consuming due to their large block.
What I finally concluded is that this is too complex, and therefore likely to introduce a weakness, and only a proposal like what Gavin forwarded would work.

I'm assuming valid transactions. From what I understand, a transaction with only one input, and one input, which is the smallest kind, will be about 240 bytes:
Giving a maximum throughput of 7 tps.
The practical throughput is 3 tps. 


I doubt it was ever 7.3 tps. Do you have the data? Can you show for which period? Yes I run a full node.

Basic txs with the minimum one input and one output are 240 bytes, from what I understand. Tx size has gone up with the introduction of transaction types like multisig, but not from a base that was lower than 240 B. I don't think you can create 10 txs/sec with spendable outputs with 1 MB blocks.


A micro transaction, or 'micropayment', is actually defined as a payment of 1/10th of a cent, or 1/1000th of a dollar (hence, 'micro'). Which no one is suggesting be done on the Bitcoin blockchain. So we should really be using a term like 'small value' or 'petty' transaction.
Small value, everyday transactions could indeed go on the blockchain if the maximum throughput was 34,000 tx/s. That's far more than Visa does on average, and Visa handles many small value transactions.


It's actually ~16.8 MB, not 20 MB. There's no guarantee block sizes would reach the limit. If they did, some people would have to switch from full to light nodes. It's a price worth paying to allowing millions more people to directly access the blockchain.

It does if you spend from the same address more than once. However, that can change with default wallet settings.

The rest of the txs have to be done on the ledgers of bitbanks, which are extremely centralised and points of regulation.

Why in the world would people choose a currency that depreciates when they can have one that doesn't? The market will always choose the better store of value.


But that's not a problem, because people can do that with other currencies, like the USD. Bitcoin is not striving to be the world's sole currency. Fiat will exist, and will continue being inflationary. You can spend inflating dollars to your heart's content, and also spend bitcoin when you need it.


You're referring to credit card fraud. I'm referring to identity theft, which is a broader class of crime that can include someone having identification documents in your name issued to themselves.
Even WRT credit card fraud, it is not always detected. Sometimes people don't notice an extra charge on their credit card bill.
Credit card fraud also adds costs to transactions, as CC networks price the losses into the transaction fees merchants pay. Lower transaction fees would result in businesses being able to offer lower prices to consumers.

Many altcoins grew and then crashed, so it's always risky, even if it's experienced rapid growth for a period.
Bitcoin is much less volatile now than any of the altcoins, because's it's much harder to move the value of a digital currency with a market cap of $800 million 50% than one with a market cap of $1-10 million. Altcoins see price changes of 50-150% in a single day quite often, whereas such a drastic change has happened only very occasionally with bitcoin in the past year (including a couple times in the last two weeks I believe).

Cool video and thanks for adding to the debate, but I strongly disagree with the idea of having BTC limited to large transactions with $20 fees.
Limiting the growth in the size of the blockchain would mean massively increasing the reliance on trusted third party payment processors, which goes against every thing that BTC was created to avoid. 
BTC-only transactions require no trust and no third party intermediaries. That's something BTC needs to maintain if it's going to have a real impact.
Running a node will become a more resource taxing endeavor in a global-scale BTC network, but it would still be a purely technical process to become a node operator, with no political involvement. A node can be any where in the world and accessed over the internet.
Relying on a network of large 'trusted' third party payment processors to handle almost all transactions is what would hand control of the network to governments and their regulatory agencies.
Nakamoto's original vision was for 100GB blocks and a network that can handle global-scale activity. If you want a small network relying on third party payment processors, there are more than a dozen BTC-variants that you can use for that. BTC should follow Nakamoto's vision.

Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency worth trading.
I divide cryptocurrencies into two camps: Bitcoin-alts and altcoins. Bitcoin-alts are identical to Bitcoin apart from maybe a new block time, a different hashing algorithm to provide proof of work, and a different number of total coins generated. 
Altcoins are also based on Bitcoin code but have substantial differences from it that provide them with unique capabilities. I put Namecoin and PPCoin in this category.
Bitcoin-alts are too similar to Bitcoin to have any utility. They don't provide any unique features, and only devalue cryptocurrency by inflating the number of coins.
Namecoin is excellent, but isn't meant to be a currency. Its utility comes from its DNS. I would trade Namecoin domains but not namecoins.
PPCoin has potential, for having a novel security model, but its implementation of Proof of Stake is not well documented and has not been proven, so can't be relied upon.
XRPs, which is not really a cryptocurrency, but still deserves mention for being an alternative currency, also have potential, but like PPcoin, Ripple's security model is not well documented, is unproven, and is at this point not open source.
@_date: 2013-05-13 14:59:51


I see it like this:
Either BTC-based cryptocurrency is a scarce resource, due to the network effect maintaining the dominance of the BTC blockchain, in which case 
the market cap of BTC will go way up, or it's easy for parallel networks to gain market share from the leading network, in which case cryptocurrency will not be seen as having an ability to store value, and therefore will not be adopted to a significant extent.
Based on this belief, I project that if I invest only in BTC, then I lose out on the chance of making a short term profit from bitcoin-alts, but I don't lose out on the opportunity of long term gains, because there is a low chance of a situation where BTC-based cryptocurrency can make large gains if it is fragmented.
I could day trade, and buy into the hype of a bitcoin-alt, and sell when it gets high, and repeat the cycle, but I think I would then be contributing to the network fragmentation to an extent, by feeding the altcoin hypers/miners capital. This is a poor bargain in my thinking, as I see it as gaining some short term day trading profits at the cost of reducing the likelihood of the massive gains that could happen if BTC becomes the global money internet.
Is there some altruism in this decision? Not really. It's true that I also want a world where cryptocurrency is a reality, and think that encouraging the bitcoin community to stick with 21 million coins increases the likelihood of that reality coming to be, but I think I want that future reality because it would benefit me personally.
Just because the motivation is not direct profit doesn't mean it's not based on self-interest, so I don't think I'm being altruistic.


You may very well be right, but it remains to be seen, and I think it's at least worth trying to promote BTC as the only protocol of its kind. It could get to the point where its size gives it an entrenched advantage that competing protocols can't challenge.


It's really not risky from a financial perspective. BTC-alts can be mined/bought at a low cost.
I don't do it because, at the moment, I see only the potential for short term day trading profit from bitcoin-alts, and I see my participation in that market as nudging the needle toward BTC-based cryptocurrency not realizing the dream of a global internet of money, which could reward me much more.

BTC is going to be forked very soon any way, to create a replacement for the 1MB block size limit, so we can include other changes in that fork.
A change to more frequent block times is a straightforward improvement that doesn't change any of BTC's important properties (decentralization, 2.1 quadrillion Satoshi limit).
In my opinion it's better if we improve the BTC protocol, rather than switching to a new blockchain and resetting every one's currency holdings to zero every time a minor protocol improvement comes along.

Oh I agree, from a purely marketing pov, they're effective, because they appear cheap, and because those who start the new blockchains can make a lot of money easily mining the coins and then selling them, so they spend a lot of time inventing hype about them.
The answer to that is to change the unit of account in bitcoin, to millibits, or something smaller, so that bitcoins appear cheap, and to call out the altcoin hype.
As for the infrastructure, you're right that it wouldn't be too difficult for a merchant to accept additional bitcoin-variants. For users though, there is no advantage to using nearly identical coins from different networks.
It just adds complexity and additional trading requirements (having to trade between different networks when they need a particular cryptocurrency) without providing any utility, since the altcoins use exactly the same blockchain-based technology and limited supply economic model.

This is one of many mechanisms, other than the hard limit, by which the block size is restrained. The existence of these other checks on block size is why I think we should have a high hard limit. It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that if Gavin's geometrically rising &gt;16 MB hard limit proposal is implemented, and broadband connection speeds fail to keep up with its increase, that we will end up with blocks that are too big, given the core developers and miners have these other tools at their disposal to limit block size growth.

The source is my own observations.
PPCoin will eventually transition to a novel security model: proof of stake, but it's unclear how it works, since no specs have been published on it, and it's untested, so it's not reliable IMO.
Bitcoin-lite (litecoin) is identical to bitcoin besides using a different hashing algorithm to provide proof of work, and using a shorter block time. All of the claims made about the hashing algorithm, sCrypt, have turned out to be false:
It was claimed it could be done with CPUs just as efficiently as GPUs. GPUs now dominate on it.
Then it was claimed FPGAs and ASICs couldn't be designed that would provide a significant efficiency boost over GPUs. That's turning out to be false as the initial stages of FPGA development have begun, and numerous people knowledgeable on the matter have pointed out that ASICs can in fact be designed that can do sCrypt more efficiently.
Regarding the shorter block time, the effect of it is that, given an equal hashrate, a transaction is secured more quickly, but it comes at the cost of more honest work lost to latency, which makes &gt;50% attacks easier to execute.
I personally think it provides a net-advantage, but I think it's a very small one, because most point of sale transactions are 'confirmed' instantly, in that most people don't wait for a block to be discovered before accepting one, and most online transactions can afford to wait 10 minutes-1 hour for absolutely secure confirmation, because it takes longer than that to ship any way.
The small advantage doesn't even come close to making up for the insignificant network size of bitcoin-lite, and the fact that abandoning a cryptocurrency and starting from scratch every time a near clone is created with a minor protocol improvement would destroy investor confidence and prevent significant adoption. We can instead change bitcoin's protocol if we find a change that would improve it.
I also think using sCrypt is a disadvantage, because it's a less tested and analyzed algorithm, and therefore there's more potential a flaw will be found in it. Also, the higher cost of developing ASICs to perform sCrypt  could lead to centralized mining, as fewer companies can afford the R&amp;D costs to develop them, unlike SHA256 mining, where there are many competing ASIC makers emerging to sell to bitcoin miners.

The use of Scrypt is a superficial innovation. All of the claims about it are hype. It will be dominated by specialized hardware if Bitcoin-alts that use Scrypt for proof of work get big enough.
The one slight protocol improvement some of the Bitcoin-alts have is, in my opinion, reducing the block time, but it's not a big enough advantage to warrant switching to a new blockchain, doesn't make up for their disadvantage in having a smaller network of users/merchants/exchanges, and it's one Bitcoin could adopt technically rather easily, given it just requires tweaking a parameter.

Altcoins are not pyramid schemes, as the payout from investing into one is unpredictable and set by the market, rather than by a schedule, and purport to serve a market need, unlike in a pyramid scheme.
They could be described as pump and dumps though. I see alternate cryptocurrencies based on bitcoin technology as testnets. 
The original testnet is an alternative bitcoin blockchain used by the dev team for testing. It is identical to bitcoin except with a different genesis block, so it is not interoperable with the bitcoin network. 
It is frequently reset for testing purposes.
I see it like this:
Bitcoin - a decentralized peer-to-peer currency designed and created by a pseudonymous person, Satoshi Nakamoto
Testnet 1 - an alternative blockchain created by bitcoin devs by forking bitcoin.
Testnet 2 (Ixcoin) - an alternative blockchain created by forking bitcoin and promoted by 'Thomas Nasakioto'. Increases bitcoin's inflation rate to 96 coins per block and changes the expected maturity date to 2015.
Testnet 3 (I0coin) - an alternative blockchain created by forking Testnet 2
Testnet 4 (solidcoin) - an alternative blockchain created by forking bitcoin. It adds a central control component with trusted nodes.
Testnet 5 (tenebrix) - an alternative blockchain created by forking bitcoin. It targets a block time of 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes and swaps out the SHA256 hashing algorithm for the Scrypt hashing algorithm.

The altcoins provide a great testing platform for trying out different parameters within the bitcoin code, but to the extent that the bitcoin community accepts them as viable additions to the cryptocurrency economy, they undermine the 21 million coin limit on bitcoin's supply, and thereby threaten the value of bitcoin-based currency, as there is no limit to the number of forked chains that can be created, with each adding tens of millions of coins.

I agree 100%. Satoshi even suggested moving the decimal point three places, so that 0.001 BTC is redefined as 1 BTC, when the price of bitcoin got too high for the current denomination to be convenient to use. 
The least we could do is start using smaller denominations.

Bitcoin businesses already exist legally in the United States, with Bitcoin as it is: a digital cash with real fungibility, so I can't imagine why you would set out to create software that would give the US government the idea of changing its mind and mandating that exchanges use these white/black lists that ruin that fungibility.
This white/blacklisting convention, if widely accepted, would create different tiers of bitcoin, each of different value. It would encourage users to download software that can distinguish between the different tiers, so that they can receive payment in the good bitcoins and avoid the bad ones.
If a government starts mandating that exchanges use a list that it controls, and users download and start using clients that check against this list, Bitcoin would no longer be decentralized.

The Central Bank is also not intelligent. It, like the government, only acts when one special interest or another spurs it to act. 
Given the difficulty, both politically and logistically, of banning what is essentially a type of digital information transfer, the threshold that special interest pressure needs to reach to effectuate a political effort to prohibit it I think is high, and I don't think it will be reached, especially as bitcoin becomes more deeply integrated into the economy and that threshold increases.

Actually, some ASICs miners are easier to setup for ordinary people than GPU rigs, since everything is preconfigured, requiring less DIY, so I think as ASICs become a mass-consumer product that are easy to order online and cheaper, BTC will actually become much easier to mine than the bitcoin-alts.

If someone attacks Bitcoin, they could also attack the Bitcoin-alts. In fact, they could use a few hundred thousand dollars of FPGAs, attack the alt, then attack Bitcoin, and it would easier than if the entire p2p currency market was in Bitcoin, as that would take more hashing hardware.


In my opinion, this small advantage doesn't come close to making up for its disadvantage in having a much smaller network and supporting economy. I also think Bitcoin could adopt faster confirmations quite easily, since it's just a parameter tweak, so it could be a fleeting advantage.


That doesn't mean there's a point to it. That's a reason why it attracted attention, but it doesn't actually provide value to the rest of the economy. Mining is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

I believe they are exploiting the desire of people to be early adopters, and nearly every claim about them is hype. I think in the long run, as their lack of utility, relative to the larger BTC network, becomes more apparent, it will reduce much of the interest speculators have in them. We're already seeing the growth in interest in them dampen.
As for innovation and intrinsic value: they're almost indistinguishable from BTC, different block time and hashing algorithm for providing POW notwithstanding, so I see them as incredibly unoriginal and not contributing much in value.
What's interesting is when people think BTC is "expensive", while BTC-alts are "cheap". The only basis for this is the mistaken belief that the number of coins is what matters, rather than the value of someone's cryptocurrency stock (in other words, it doesn't matter if you have 0.1 BTC or 10,000 BTC-alts. All that matters is how much the total holding is worth). I think it's a lesson that BTC should start using millicoins (mBTC) as the standard currency unit.
Frankly, I think BTC's blockchain technology has many more uses besides currency, and it's sad that the biggest area of activity is creating new BTC-based blockchains to provide the same currency function that BTC already provides, simply to profit miners who want to continue earning money producing hashes on their GPUs.
I'd like to see BTC-technology being applied to other uses, the way Namecoin did with DNS, and Bitmessage did with messaging.

A different hashing algorithm it's just another way of showing proof of work. It's superficially innovative and being hyped as a big change when it's not.
Bitcoin-alts are only useful for testing out changed parameters. They're like really large testnets. Otherwise, they make bitcoin-based cryptocurrency less useful, by having transactions split among different technically almost identical but incompatible blockchains.

True. What matters is how much it costs, using the most efficient hardware, to produce those hashes. If hardware gets more efficient, an attacker will just use the more efficient hardware to produce more hashes spending the same amount of money.
The problem is that no good algorithm has been found that's ASIC proof. Memory heavy Scrypt has the problem of making verification memory intensive as well, which causes all sorts of possible. Furthermore, there's no way to prevent specialized hardware, ASIC or not, from being created for an algorithm. GPU mining rigs are highly specialized for example, and make 'consumer grade' PCs with their single GPU uncompetitive.
It's also possible that the domination of mining by specialized hardware is actually a net positive, by making a cryptocurrency resistant to botnet attacks.

I think it could be a good pump and dump, but I'd recommend you invest in something that you can believe in in the long run, even if it doesn't make you as much profit in the short run.
Bitcoin near-clones (litecoin is identical to bitcoin except for two changed parameters) are get-rich schemes that discredit the whole concept of bitcoin-based cryptocurrency by pushing up the effective number of coins in circulation past the 21 million limit.
Technically, they all work almost exactly the same, so from an actual usability standpoint, it's immeasurably more convenient to use Bitcoin which has by far the largest market cap, network of users and supporting services.

I don't think the max block size is a big factor either way, as the current block size limit is 1 MB, meaning the data added by moving to 1 minute blocks would make up 1/1252nd of the total data added to the blockchain per day.
A more important factor I think is thin-clients, like mobile wallets, which would see their memory requirements increase from 16 MB to 160 MB if the block time was 1 minute.

I think Bitcoin has a lot of excess security and could afford a lower hashrate. 4% of the current hashrate might be too low, but something much less than 100% of the current 3 PH/s (and rising) might also be sufficient.
Also, that 1 bitcoin per block is going to increase substantially if there are a lot more transactions per block. Imagine transaction volumes 1,000X larger than today.

Yes it's nice and it is an advantage. The reason I think it's not a particularly big one is that the majority of POS sale transactions require no confirmations (if they did, the usefulness of cryptocurrency would be quite limited). 
Also, merchants offering digital good downloads don't need to wait for any confirmations. Buying goods that will ship takes more than 60 minutes any way, so I don't think it's really a big disadvantage.

Most of the claims about the Bitcoin-alts are hype.


A shorter block time most definitely does not reduce blockchain bloat. It increases it by increasing the number of block headers in the blockchain.
I personally think a shorter block time is in fact a slight protocol improvement, but I don't think a new network with only this feature makes up for the advantage Bitcoin has in the size of its network of users/nodes, its hashrate and the amount of supporting services/software it has.
I also don't think it makes sense to start a new blockchain that resets everyone's currency holdings to zero every time a minor protocol improvement comes along. It's better to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol over time in my opinion.

Yanis Varoufakis is quite a piece of work. He claims the monetary system was a total disaster all throughout history, until governments finally discovered fiat currency, shortly after the crash of 1929, which, by the way, was caused by the gold standard, and had nothing to do with central banking. Apparently 42 percent of corporate profits being earned by the financial sector over the last 40 years has nothing to do with the governments having taken control of money through their central banks. When bad things happen in the banking sector under a fiat regime, he'll find something other than monetary policy to blame. 
Antonopoulos handled that debate really well, and never stooped down to Varoufakis' level or appeared defensive/combative. The comparison between the effect of the internet on the telecom industry and how he sees Bitcoin affecting finance was excellent.
In Andreas' talk on the current situation Greece, there's one thing I'd disagree with him on: Greece's current predicament is not, as he argues, due Greece's adoption of the Euro taking away its ability to devalue its currency during its recession. This idea assumes prices are sticky, and that without a central bank forcing prices down surreptitiously by devaluing the currency they use as a unit of account, the market is helpless to adjust prices on its own.

It's mathematically not true that it's just as easy to get ten 1-minute confirmations in a row as to get one 10-confirmation.
This is because the probability of a miner finding a block is exactly proportional to their share of the total network hashrate. This is true whether blocks are generated every 10 seconds or every 10 minutes.
So the probability of getting a number of blocks consecutively will always be equal to the miner's hashrate divided by the network hashrate to the power of the number of blocks.
M = miner's hashrate
T = total network hashrate
n = number of consecutive blocks found
p = probability of miner with M hashrate in a network with T total hashrate finding n number of consecutive blocks
p = M / T^n

I don't know why we wouldn't want to change the meaning of 'bitcoin' again if it's well known and the price increases many fold.

Right now, when a large percentage of people haven't heard of a 'bitcoin', I think introducing a new denomination, like 'millibit', as the standard would be easier, than doing so sometime in a wonderful future when everyone had already grown used to the 'bitcoin' name.

The reason is that it leads to inflation. What's the point of having a limit on number of coins issued in the blockchain if you're going to have an unlimited number of blockchains all based on BTC and all providing the same currency function?
There's only a certain amount of transaction volume an economy needs, meaning the more coins there are, the less each will be worth. We should stick with 21 million bitcoins, or 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis, not constantly add more to profit miners running GPUs.

While I haven't looked closely at the details of Hearn's post, or spent a lot of time thinking about his argument, my first reaction is that I agree with you, and the slippery slope is not at all worth it, and that any taint tracking client feature runs counter to Bitcoin's design goal, which is to treat coins as fungible.
As an aside, you refer to this as 'coin coloring', when this is specifically 'blacklisting'. Coin coloring is giving extra value to specific coins, that others voluntarily recognize, and allows people to use the Bitcoin blockchain and network to store and transfer high value instruments. The underlying bitcoin in colored coins does not lose any value (not blacklisted) and is fully fungible with other bitcoin.

Awesome. We need more academic work like this on Bitcoin. Academia is best positioned to improve the protocol.
This is my post in this thread, any feedback appreciated:
This is incredibly serendipitous. I began writing a paper in Google Docs this week, titled:
"Disposable, non-orphaning, merge-mined blockchains for rapid transaction confirmation"
The idea is to have a parallel merge-mined mini-block 'grove' (since there could be more than one tree) to determine which transaction is chosen in the event of a double spend.
I'll describe it in case it can contribute to the discussion.
*Disposable, non-orphaning, merge-mined blockchains for rapid transaction confirmation*
The proposal is to have parallel chains of mini-blocks (3 seconds) that begin at every new 'real block' (10 minutes), and rather than orphaning forks of these mini-block chains with lower difficulty, nodes save them along with the greatest difficulty chain.
This parallel 'tree' or 'grove' of mini-block chains would be merge-mined with the main blockchain, to conserve hashing power, and would give a higher resolution picture of when a transaction was first propagated into the network.
Upon the creation of a new 10-minute block, nodes would check if any of the transactions contained in it (in-block transactions) have a double spend in the parallel mini-block chains that has at least 10 more mini-blocks backing it than backing the in-block transaction. The mini-blocks counted toward this comparison can be in any of the chains, including in lower difficulty forks. If the block does contain such a transaction, then it is invalid and not accepted by other nodes. 
Under this rule, a transaction could be confirmed in an average of 30 seconds. Once a particular transaction is in a mini-block with 10 mini-blocks (in any chain) built on top of it, with no double spends detected, a person can be confident that the transaction cannot be replaced by a double spent transaction.
There are two further rules required to make this work:
1) Require that a new real block contain all transactions with at least 10 mini-blocks backing them. Without such a rule, mining nodes can simply refuse to include any transactions into the main block they're hashing on, or refuse to include those transactions which they've detected a double spend attempt on, to avoid the risk of a block they generate being invalid according to the mini-blockchain rule and orphaned.
To avoid an attacker being able to take advantage of this rule to bloat the blockchain with zero or low-fee transactions, the rule can be qualified with the '&gt;=10 mini-block backed transactions that blocks are required to include' being only those with a fee to kb ratio that is 10 percent greater than the median fee to kb ratio of all fee-containing transactions over the last 100 real blocks.
The list of transactions with fees that would be used to determine the median transaction fee to kb ratio would be weighed by the 'bitcoin days destroyed' of each transaction, to prevent manipulation of the median through generation of a large number of small value, low input age, transactions.
2) Nodes refuse to build on mini-block chains that contain a transaction that conflicts (contains a double spend) with any transaction that has at least 3 mini-blocks backing it. This would ensure that any double spend transaction that is generated more than an average of 9 seconds after the initial transaction will have very few mini-blocks built on top of it, virtually guaranteeing the first transaction will be included in the next real block if enough time transpires until the new block is generated for 7 more mini-blocks to be generated.
Edit, a couple more thoughts:
* Using these rules, there could be cases when there is a network split due to a block being accepted by some nodes, and rejected by others, due to it containing a double spend and there existing conflicting views of how many mini-blocks back the original transaction (one set of nodes could have a local view showing the first transaction out backs the second by 9 mini-blocks, and another could have a local view showing the first transaction out-backing the second by the required 10 mini-blocks to be secure from a double spend). In this case, an additional rule, of nodes accepting a new block, even if it contains an 'illegal' double spend, if the number of mini-blocks backing the new block exceeds the number of mini-blocks generated on top of the old block after the fork, by a particular number (e.g. 5 blocks), can be used to resolve network split
* An additional rule could be that new blocks must publish in their headers the 'median transaction fee to kb ratio' for the last 100 blocks. This would allow SPV clients to operate with lower trust requirements, since they would know just from the block headers what transaction fee they need to include with their transaction to guarantee it will be secure from a double spend attempt at/after 10 mini-blocks
The strengths of this proposal are:
* Like the GHOST protocol additions proposed in the linked paper, this provides faster confirmations without a rise in orphans caused by propagation latency reducing the effective network hashrate, as results from simply shortening block times.
* There would be no extra sets of block headers in the blockchain as would be required with more frequent blocks.
* It's a soft-fork that is backward compatible with non-mining nodes that don't upgrade.

They're similar in that both create a persistent global network that allows everyone in the world to interact freely and without censorship, in one community, at the speed of light.
They're dissimilar in that, while the internet allows interaction merely through the transmission of information, Bitcoin allows interaction through the transmission of value.
The reason that Bitcoin can enable this more significant type of global interaction to be done is that it is the first method of property management that is fully formalized and public, and therefore can be distributed as a global network and operated automatically.
The capabilities that Bitcoin gives humankind makes it, relative to the internet, an economic and political juggernaut.

The way I see it, to the extent that altcoins have value, they take value away from Bitcoin. There's a limit to the amount of crypto-speculator money is out there, and the more block chains they're divided across, the less value each will have.
The best chance that cryptocurrency has, in my opinion, is if Bitcoin maintains its position as the main blockchain for transactions, and attains a strong enough network effect where copycats no longer threaten it. At that point, it will be seen as a safe store of value, despite being open-sourced and easily duplicated, which will encourage mass adoption.
As far as the load of microtransactions, I think the Bitcoin network needs to be able to scale up to handle millions per minute. Dividing transactions across several incompatible networks (each of which devalues the cryptocoins in the other blockchains) is not the best solution IMO. 
The good of having a non-SHA-2 based Bitcoin-alt in reserve in case SHA-2 breaks is not big enough to make up for the harm that having Bitcoin duplicates does to investor confidence. Again, this is just my opinion.

Speculators don't assume that at all. If they did, they would buy it until the price went up to $25. The logic that leads to the above conclusion is that the market cap of Bitcoin-lite (Litecoin) will reach that of Bitcoin, which is groundless.




Litecoin/Feathercoin are NOT theoretically more secure than Bitcoin. They are both obviously magnitudes less secure than Bitcoin, owing to their lower difficulty, and even assuming equal difficulty, there is nothing to suggest that their shorter block time and use of Scrypt instead of SHA256 would make them more secure.

I'm extremely loyal to Bitcoin, as a universal open source money protocol. 


It's fully decentralized, digital money which has a guaranteed limit on its supply.


If the community puts in place a permanent 1 MB block size limit to increase transaction fees, or changed the maximum number of coins that will be generated from the current 21 million.


If the community changed the protocol to allow censorship of transaction data by governments.


All of the above. I think it's revolutionary on all fronts.
Other insights: I won't use a service that promotes the use of multiple Bitcoin-based blockchains (altcoins), all providing the same currency function.
I think fragmentation of Bitcoin currency across several incompatible Bitcoin-based networks, each with tens of millions of coins, would have the same effect as inflation, and would reduce the ability of cryptocoins to maintain value, thereby reducing the viability of the Bitcoin economy.

Let's hope Litecoin support never comes. That's the last thing an open source currency network needs: evidence that a blockchain that's identical to it apart from two changed parameters can take market share from it. Investors would conclude that being open source and easily duplicated, cryptocoins have no real scarcity.

Aside from the standard 'Bitcoin is the future yadayada':
The PoS system providers are best positioned to both improve the Bitcoin infrastructure and to profit from the growth of the Bitcoin economy.
The financial returns of a potential Bitcoin venture will be hard for them to project, because there are many unknowns surrounding the future growth trajectory and characteristics of the Bitcoin economy, and this makes it high risk, but the flip side is that it has great potential upside.
If they do go with Bitcoin integration, they will probably be better off in the long run interfacing with the open network and blockchain rather than trying to create a proprietary network, because the Bitcoin economy is evolving quickly right now and everything but the protocol is likely to be drastically different in a few years, making any proprietary network created now very possibly obsolete in the future.

Your concerns are unfounded. If you follow the discussions regarding the 54.3 uBTC minimum, you'll see that they fully intend to change it if the value of bitcoin goes up. This change is only intended to discourage transactions that are economically unspendable. Economically unspendable transactions are those where the fee to spend the amount is more than the amount itself. These are not useful for value transfer right now any way, so the only uses this change would eliminate are those where parties are using transactions as a method to transmit information through the blockchain.
The bitcoin blockchain is a distributed ledger and shouldn't be used to record half a cent transactions. Those can be recorded off the chain, and when the total amount owing reaches a higher amount, like 5 cents, then the bitcoin blockchain can be used to settle the debt.
Allowing half a cent transactions into the blockchain leads to bloat, which reduces the number of people that can run full nodes, which reduces Bitcoin's decentralization.
Any way, fortunately, this is not a protocol change, and people are free to run different clients. Ultimately Bitcoin will operate according to the type of client the majority decide to use.

Off-chain transactions are completely centralized. High-bandwidth/hard-drive nodes not being able to create a decentralized network is theoretical, because there's nothing technically centralized about a network with nodes that have high levels of resource consumption. You're theorizing on the reaction of network participants to higher bandwidth/bandwidth requirements.
Off-chain decentralized solutions replacing off-chain centralized ones is even more theoretical, as there's no well defined and critiqued proposal for how it could be done.
BTC's rapid growth phase will end once transaction fees rise too much IMO because I believe it is extremely unlikely that an adequately useful decentralized off-chain solution will be invented.

The most reliable way is to invest in bitcoin. I think it's easier than mining and has less variability than investing in mining or bitcoin companies.
It's still very risky though, as bitcoin is an emerging technology asset.
If you invest in bitcoin, my personal opinion is that it's better to invest for the long run, and not sell if it crashes. I think you need to be able to wait two or more years regardless of what happens to the price to reduce the chance that you'll sell at a loss.

Why wouldn't we have interest in alternatives? We would simply push for Bitcoin to adopt any improvements/changes.


This is debunked by nagdude:
Now to his main criticism:


The 'get rich' aspect is massively overstated. Yes people who invested in bitcoins while they were undervalued will certainly make a lot of money, but in the grand scheme of things, even in the best case scenario for adoption of Bitcoin, it will be miniscule relative to the wealth generated by those who take advantage of the new technical capabilities of Bitcoin.
Let's say each bitcoin goes to $100,000 (in 2013 dollars), and the largest holder, Satoshi Nakamoto, has kept all of the 1 million bitcoins some claim he mined.
In this scenario, the total bitcoin money supply will be worth $2.1 trillion, meaning it has become among the most widely used currencies in the world, and we can assume has revolutionized the world with its new capabilities.
For founding Bitcoin (and personally inventing the technology), and helping it develop at its nascency, Satoshi Nakamoto will be worth not much more than Bill Gates at his peak wealth. 
This is nothing considering that at that price per bitcoin, he would have been responsible for creating the single most revolutionary product/technology in history, with an impact far exceeding that of any business created before. Bitcoin would be a technology that is so powerful that the value of its currency would rival that of the state-backed currencies of the world's major economic powers. $100 billion in earnings would be relatively small considering this.
And that will only happen ONCE. Over time, new fortunes will be created, by those who create businesses that accept and pay in bitcoin, and whose fortunes have nothing to do with investing early in the currency.
If Bitcoin survives for a long enough time, which at a value of $100,000 each, it would probably be in a position to do, dozens of business empires, enabled by Bitcoin, will be created that rival the value of Satoshi's initial holding, making the wealth earned by the early adopters an increasingly small percentage of the wealth generated by individuals in the Bitcoin economy over time.

So it's a way to make money from speculating in a near clone. I'm more interested in seeing Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency succeed than making a quick buck. If the average investor sees new clones and near-clones of Bitcoin fragmenting the entire market, they might conclude that Bitcoin, being digital and open source, has no scarcity, and therefore no way to maintain its value. The fact that the number of coins in a blockchain are limited would at that point be meaningless, and with that, the most important quality pushing the value of bitcoins and bitcoin-alts would be gone in people's minds.
If that happens, then I think the probability that we'll live in a world where cryptocurrency is used everywhere will be severely diminished. There's more in life for me than getting a boat.

Shorter block time doesn't make finding a block any easier, since the probability of finding a block is always equal to the percentage of the network hashrate a block generator has.
Shorter blocks do make finding consecutive blocks easier, because an attacker doesn't need to wait for blocks to propagate, while the rest of the network does. This makes a shorter block time blockchain easier to &gt;50% attack. 
With one-minute block times, 10% of Bitcoin's honest work would be lost, which given the current hashrate, I think Bitcoin can easily afford to lose in exchange for transactions being secured more quickly.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:34:18




A shorter block time has both advantages and disadvantages. I think on the balance it is a slight advantage, but it's insignificant compared to Bitcoin's network and hashrate size advantage.


I don't see how that is an advantage for Bitcoin-alts. It just means that Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency has a lower barrier to entry from competition, which actually is a strike against the entire concept, as it discredits its digital scarcity.




It's insignificant compared to Bitcoin's. This is a case of Litecoin being better than other Bitcoin-alts, not it being comparable to Bitcoin.




This is all speculation. A single Litecoin address holds 10 percent of all the litecoins. 
A key point is that Bitcoin's biggest holders were those who created most of the technology used in all Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency, with the biggest holder being the person who contributed most to the technology: Satoshi Nakamoto. They were people like Hal Finney, a cryptographer who helped invent PGP, and who helped develop the early Bitcoin network, which at that point was totally unproven and experimental, because he was interested in it as a technology, not as a way get rich. The big holders of Bitcoin-alts on the other hand were mostly those wishing to be 'early adopters' after seeing how well Bitcoin's early adopters did.
I would rather Satoshi Nakamoto be rewarded as a result of the success of Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency, given he invented it, than some Bitcoin-alt investor/miner who wanted to be an early adopter in a near clone of Bitcoin.

Forks of Linux are not currencies. They can fragment all they want and, as long as they stay compatible, their utility doesn't decrease (or least not substantially). Bitcoin's fragmentation hits at its most important quality: a store of value. Each fragmentation adds another set of millions of cryptocoins, and dilutes the cryptocoins in already existing blockchains.
The best chance that BTC-based cryptocurrency has, in my opinion, is if Bitcoin maintains its position as the main blockchain for transactions, and attains a strong enough network effect where copycats no longer threaten it. At that point, it will be seen as a safe store of value, despite being open-sourced and easily duplicated, which will encourage mass adoption.

The blockchain is public, so it's not a particularly good black market currency. 
It's good for low priority crimes like buying drugs, where law enforcement is not going to invest large amounts tracking end users, but would be terrible for high-profile crimes like murder where all of the connections in the blockchain would be investigated and followed up on to identify each party that interacted with the killer.

To the extent to which bitcoin users adopt altcoins like litecoin, it undermines the 21 million coin limit. It's not really limited to 21 million coins if you can create a new blockchain with tens of millions of coins and people accept them. 
There's no reason why people would stop at litecoin. If the idea that introducing a new blockchain and using it, instead of every one using the same network and limited set of coins, gains acceptance, then the effective limit on the supply of cryptocurrency that can be used in trade vanishes.
The value of coins comes from the economic need for currency divided by the number of coins in circulation, so infinite supply would mean zero value.

* The 1 MB block size limit. It must be lifted, as it creates a lot of uncertainty about the network's ability to scale to process more transactions per block. The uncertainty comes from the fact that the longer it stays in place, the more chance there is that members of the Bitcoin community will decide that the 1 MB block size limit, which was meant to be a temporary anti-DOS measure, should be turned into a permanent limit.
* The standard unit of account in Bitcoin is equal to 100,000,000 Satoshis, which is too large, and results in a ticker price that seems too high for a currency to the average person.

I think more transactions comes with a higher market capitalization. I don't think you can separate the two. The people buying a Bitcoin-variants will promote the use of those networks among merchants, and eventually some merchants will accept both Bitcoin and the Bitcoin 2 coins.
In any case, even if we assume a second network would only be used for investment, that is still taking away investors from the first Bitcoin network, which increases the volatility of the first, for no net benefit overall.


To really diversify technology risk you would need a substantially different technology. While having a different development schedule (e.g. new clients are introduced at different times) and using sCrypt offers some diversity, it's not much in my opinion. 
Litecoin, or as I call it, Bitcoin-lite, uses software identical to Bitcoin's, besides the two parameter changes, and tracks Bitcoin's development, copying all of the upgrades made to the Bitcoin client, so any real persistent bug will affect it as a well. 
Temporary bugs like block chain splits caused by an incompatible new client are not serious problems, as they can be resolved quickly. Other bugs will affect both equally.

I think it could be a good pump and dump, but I'd recommend you invest in something that you can believe in in the long run, even if it doesn't make you as much profit in the short run.
Bitcoin near-clones (litecoin is identical to bitcoin except for two changed parameters) are get-rich schemes that discredit bitcoin-based cryptocurrency as a whole by pushing up the effective number of coins in circulation past the 21 million limit.
Technically, they all work almost exactly the same, so from an actual usability standpoint, it's immeasurably more convenient to use bitcoin which has by far the largest market cap, network of users and supporting services.
As for missing the boat: a good opportunity is in businesses that deal with bitcoin. It's very early in the game, and  I'd bet you could make a lot investing in the right companies.

The use of Scrypt is one of two changes made to Bitcoin's code to create Bitcoin-lite (Litecoin).
It's just using a different hashing algorithm to provide proof of work. The security model is exactly the same.
Both base block generation on hashing rate, which results in the network being controlled by the parties which dedicate the most resources to it. Changing the hashing algorithm makes no difference to the reliance on the economic majority being trustworthy for the network to operate.
It's possible to create highly specialized rigs, that far out-compete hardware available to ordinary people, for Scrypt mining, including FPGAs and ASICs optimized for Scrypt. 
Almost everything claimed about Scrypt is pure hype. First it was "CPU friendly", then it was "GPU friendly", and soon it will be "less ASIC friendly than SHA256". The hype keeps changing as the claims keep being debunked.
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:21:27
A larger Bitcoin network would provide all of the diversification benefit that two smaller ones would provide.
I'd argue that in a way, you could think of Bitcoin as thousands of tiny networks, connected to each other in a single network. The more people join this network, the less exposed Bitcoin becomes to volatility, because the diversity of its component networks increases. 
A second incompatible protocol doesn't change this equation. All it does, in my opinion, is fragment the network, making both less useful as a result.
For this reason, I don't see promotion of any of the current bitcoin-alts, which are all very similar to Bitcoin, as good for cryptocurrency, let alone good for Bitcoin.
I think it's certainly possible that a new digital currency will one day emerge that will be sufficiently different from Bitcoin to make it impossible for the latter to adopt its beneficial features, and sufficiently advantageous to encourage people to abandon Bitcoin in favor of the new currency, the way people are migrating from fiat to Bitcoin now, but I think it will require an effort comparable to what Satoshi made to create the original Bitcoin, and those don't happen often.
One other factor that I should mention that could be filed under 'more than one cryptocurrency network is good', is that if the Bitcoin network goes down due to a technical glitch, having an independent network does provide a backup. A glitch could be something like a software bug causing a blockchain split.
I still don't think this benefit outweighs the cost of having transactions done on incompatible networks.
*Edit, one more point: even without a challenging competitor, Bitcoin's success is not a foregone conclusion. It depends on the ability of the Bitcoin community to adapt and come together to support changes to the protocol when better features become apparent in bitcoin-variants. If Bitcoin doesn't change, then it's likely the cryptocurrency market will fragment, which I think will hold it back from reaching its potential of creating a global peer-to-peer cash network.

They're more attempts to increase the number of bitcoin-like coins than they are new currencies, since almost all of them use the same fundamental security model, and all use the same protocol for creating and propagating transactions.
Given they add very little that's new, and effectively increase the supply of coins (which discredits the idea of a limited number of coins), they're seen by many as not helpful to the promotion and adoption of Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency.

The experience you gained is worth a lot, maybe more than the potential profit you lost.
Maybe what you learned was:
* Don't risk more than you can afford to lose. If you're financially and psychologically prepared for the investment incurring a loss, then if it does happen, you can take in stride and it won't affect your daily life. 
* Diversify. If you had invested half of your BTC into ASICMiner instead of all of it, you would have still come out ahead. 
* Consider taking some profit to cover your initial investment. If you had sold some of your ASICMiner shares sooner, you could have maybe still made a big profit.
* The right investments do have huge potential gains. You came close to seeing your investment grow to $42K. Without taking risks, you don't get the chance to make that kind of return.
If you learn from your experience and try again (this time hopefully with an amount that you can comfortably afford to lose), you will have a better chance at success.

If you take into account the risk of an altcoin losing significant value or vanishing altogether, I think yes.

That's where the high growth (and risk) can be found, without the unsustainability of the altcoin market.

I think an argument can be made that IF we can give every petty transaction a high degree of security and decentralization, we should. 
So, as bandwidth gets cheaper, there's no reason not to go in that direction. In the meantime, raising the block size limit to what the network can comfortably handle is good for decentralization, as it gives more people, more direct access to the blockchain, and thus obviates the need for them to go through financial institutions acting as intermediaries, which is whole point of Bitcoin:


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

No I didn't. You're assuming that I have the same idea about what a 'cryptocurrency' is as you. A cryptocurrency can definitely be a digital commodity that sees its value increase with greater usage.


You're speculating on what people will think. I speculate people will prefer their money increasing in value to their money's value fluctuating less.


Coins being mined does nothing to increase price volatility, as it's known by the market how many coins will be mined, so it's not a variable factor.


The miners with new hardware will have no incentive to "start accepting transactions of lower transaction fees". There is no relationship between mining efficiency and what fees miners will require be paid. 
Increases in mining efficiency means being able to produce more hashes for a lower cost, which will cause those with less efficient mining hardware to go out of business. That's the only effect of hardware upgrades.


And their cheap old hardware poses no risk for the security of the network, because it's too inefficient to get &gt;50% of the network hashrate


It's not just electricity though. New hardware will add massively to the network's hashrate, making all of the old obsolete hardware not able to match the new hardware that has taken its place


I am not hoping that people will pay higher transaction fees. I am expecting that there will be more transactions if Bitcoin is successful, which is pretty much guaranteed. With an increase in volume of transactions, miners will earn a lot more transaction fees.


The transaction fee is very small, so even people in poor countries will pay. 


It doesn't as people would prefer to pay a tiny transaction fee than have the money they hold be diluted by 0.5% a year.

Just to let you know, so far there have been no reported successful double spend attacks on the bitcoin network involving transactions that have had fees.
In other words, if the transaction has a fee, and you wait 10 seconds without detecting a double spend, then the likelihood of the payer successfully reversing that payment with a double spend is very low, and if it occurs, you would be the first party to suffer this.
If your site does not allow bitcoin withdrawals/refunds of funds a user has credited to their account, then I personally think the risk of someone investing what's necessary for a double spend attack to be low and you could safety accept transfers without waiting, given you take the couple of precautions I noted (scan for double spends for 10 seconds and verify the transaction has a sufficient fee).

It means transaction fees of &lt; 1 ¢ instead of 2-3% for credit cards. It means no risk of having your account frozen like with PayPal. It means no chargeback risk.

It has Scrypt instead of SHA256, which is not a big deal. There are dozens of hashing algorithms that exist, and an unlimited number of configurations of hashing algorithms that could be used to provide proof of work. 
Changing the hashing algorithm doesn't change the fundamental security model of using proof of work to ensure that the blockchain is controlled by those who dedicate the majority of economic resources to it. Swapping SHA256 for another hashing algorithm is only superficially innovative.
As for waiting for a confirmation, 2.5 minutes is far too long for any point of sale situation. There are some cases where a shorter block time will provide an advantage, but it's a small fraction of use cases. As I mentioned:  shorter block time makes it more prone to centralization in mining, so it's a trade off.

I think the hashing algorithm has nothing to do with market use, and therefore won't affect market competition.

Coins will be lost at a very slow and gradual rate, not in huge lumps that cause price instability.
A limited long-term supply could possibly encourage more price volatility than a growing supply, but it has the benefit of being more environmentally friendly with less energy wasted on mining. 
By eliminating inflation eventually, the amount of energy expended on mining will eventually decline to the share of the total money supply made up of transaction fees every year, while the market can look to find ways to make up for any price instability caused by a limited total supply.


The complexity of creating specially made hardware for a proof of work algorithm is a disadvantage, not an advantage. It will mean that if the cryptocurrency ever does reach the point at which a party creates specially made hardware, they will likely have no competition, and it will take longer for competition to appear. 
It will mean that competition is likely to be much more limited in the specially made hardware manufacturing business around the cryptocurrency, which encourages centralization of mining.


The simplicity of SHA256 is great. There are already at least four ASIC manufacturers, which is good competition in mining hardware manufacturing for such a young cryptocurrency.


Bitcoin provides mining profits from transaction fees as well, so there will always be an incentive to mine as long as the Bitcoin economy is going strong.


There will be a lot of incentive to mine if transaction fees increase substantially from the level they are at right now, as every success scenario of Bitcoin will cause them to be.


No I'm not suggesting that one will be used as a backup for the other. I'm suggesting that a merchant will require either 0-confirmations or they will require a customer to pay using a trusted third party to eliminate the risk of a double spend. Some merchants will opt for one level of security, while others will opt for the other.
Waiting 50 seconds or 1 minute or 5 minutes or 10 minutes will always be excessive for retail situations.


It is no where close to good enough. You can't wait 5 minutes while your transaction confirms. That's totally uncompetitive with current payments systems.


More ignorance from you. I'm not referring to the extra block data from the extra block headers. I'm referring to the greater percentage of time miners spend waiting to propagate their blocks to others and receive blocks propagated by others.
I was a little unclear in my previous statement which could explain your misunderstanding (though not your ignorant and arrogant response), as it's not 'faster internet connections' that are exactly what will lead to centralization of mining, but connections to more major miners and faster data transfers to and from them as a result of being on higher quality mainline data links.
Those who receive blocks faster and are able to propagate blocks found more quickly orphan fewer of their blocks. This advantage increases as block propagation time as  a share of time spent generating a block increases with shorter block intervals.


Sybil attacks. You flood the network with sockpuppet nodes.


None are an advantage.

Lowering the block time doesn't reduce the computer power. The &gt;50% attack will be only slightly easier with faster blocks (e.g. 47%). If an attacker is able to attain a hashrate equal to 47% of the whole network, they're going to be able to get that remaining 3% to get 50% too, so I don't think it's really relevant whether the block time is 10 minutes or 1 minute with regard to this attack.

Designing an ASIC for Scrypt being more expensive only means that it will take a little longer for Scrypt mining to reach its inevitable end-state: all miners using specialized hardware.
When ASICs hit the bitcoin market, miners could either sell off their GPU mining rigs and buy ASICs, or jump into a bitcoin-fork. Which one they do will depend on whether a sufficient number of people will continue to be buy fork-coins.
So far, hyping the bitcoin-forks has been profitable for miners, so maybe you're right, and they'll switch to mining them, but things can change too, and people can realize that 1) the bitcoin-forks are identical to bitcoin in almost every way: they're not innovative at all, and 2) there is no end to the number of bitcoin-forks that can emerge, due to the cycle of miners hyping new forks when difficulty increases.

The problem with your suggestion is that it leads to inflation. What's the point of having a limit on number of coins issued in the blockchain if you're going to have an unlimited number of blockchains all based on BTC and all providing the same currency function?
There's only a certain amount of transaction volume an economy needs, meaning the more coins there are, the less each will be worth. We should stick with 21 million bitcoins, or 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis, not constantly add more to profit miners running GPUs.

ASICs will only get cheaper, as a result of competition between ASIC manufacturers. 
Regardless, in the long run, miners will be minor players in the bitcoin economy. Once bitcoin's distribution phase ends, then miners will only earn what they get from transaction fees. Those earning the most will be those who sell real goods in exchange for bitcoins.
One final point: even in mining, it's not the rich getting richer. It's the smart getting richer. There are many rich people who have no idea how mining works, or even how bitcoin works. It won't be them who buy the ASICs and make the money. It takes time to understand a technology and prospect the parties in it, and those who do are rewarded accordingly.

I think it's ALL hype.
You're going to see the following cycle:
Mining gets too difficult for some miners. A lot of people who missed out on being early adopters in bitcoin are easily convinced to buy into a new supposedly original cryptocurrency, so miners start mining it.
In actuality, the new cryptocurrency is bitcoin copied almost entirely, with only a couple of changed parameters.
These parameters are something like a different hashing algorithm, and a different block time.
The new cryptocurrency has a new name, like litecoin, obfuscating the fact that it's virtually identical to bitcoin, just without the economy.
So people buy into it, miners profit, and hype it more, perhaps copying some of the services that exist for bitcoin, and eventually difficulty goes up, and then miners look for a new bitcoin-fork to jump into and hype.
Rinse and repeat, and soon people don't trust the whole cryptocurrency market. People only like it now because it has a 21 million coin limit. With endless fragmentation of the cryptocurrency economy between virtually identical forks of bitcoin, that appeal is gone, as the scarcity of the coins, in effect, is diminished.
Now, I don't think it will happen, because of bitcoin's network effect, but I see this as the biggest of the small risks facing bitcoin right now.

It's very easy for people who hold bitcoins to buy bitcoin-alts. If personal profit is their motivation, and they really believed BTC-alts held merit, they would simply invest in them. The opposite is not true. Those without bitcoin but with a lot of cheap BTC-alts cannot simply invest in bitcoin.

The effect of deflation could be different in a multi-currency setting and for non-fiat currencies. There could also be benefits in having a limited number of units when the currency is in a peer-to-peer network, by giving its holders an incentive to invest in developing the technology. 
There are a lot of unknowns, as bitcoin does not have the same characteristics or exist in the same environment as previous deflationary currencies. What applied to them might not apply to bitcoin.
Even if it has the effect of depressing output, it doesn't mean it will fail. There are many cases of output increasing in countries experiencing deflation.

I think the perception that people will adopt bitcoin forks with minor changes and fragment demand for them is much riskier for bitcoin-based cryptocurrency's future than not having a fallback in the event of a temporary chain fork. Temporary chain forks are not even that disruptive if there are a large number of third party payment processors doing off-the-chain transactions.
I also think that the claim that there only needs to be two cryptocurrencies, and no more will be needed other than the litecoin fork, is hype, being used to convince people to support litecoin, to push its price up.


Let's ask an integrated circuit engineer. I would bet that this is not true and that producing Scrypt hashes with ASICs would be much cheaper than doing it with GPUs.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:04:55
Mining for all cryptocurrencies has a centralized tendency, because it's competitive, and competition leads to specialization. It's just that Bitcoin has a way bigger mining market, so we see it go further down the road of specialists taking over. I think it's inevitable and not a problem. The important thing is that the mining market is still totally open to competition due to the fact that all hashes are treated as equal by the protocol.
I don't think block confirmation times are that relevant for actual usage, given zero-confirmation txs are the norm for POS transactions, but I do think it is perceived as slower when people are comparing different blockchains. I'd really like it for Bitcoin to be changed to have shorter block intervals.
@_date: 2013-06-26 10:20:22
There are two advantages as far I'm been able to find:
* Less honest work is lost to latency/orphan-blocks with less frequent blocks. Since an attacker doesn't need to worry about latency, more latency gives an attacker attempting a &gt;50% attack an advantage against the honest miners. For Bitcoin, I don't think losing some honest work would be a particularly big risk, as the hashrate is so massive
* Mining can be more decentralized with longer block times, for the same reason &gt;50% attacks are harder: less latency. Since hobbyists/less-professional miners are likely to have slower internet connections than professional miners, they are at a greater disadvantage when there is more periods of network propagation where latency unevenly affects the network.
I think Bitcoin should switch to a shorter block time.
@_date: 2013-03-16 16:33:20


I think that is possible now. A zero-confirmation transaction is safe for most cases, like paying for gas, and is instant, so you could pay and go, without any wait.
Neither waiting 2 minutes nor waiting 10 minutes is practical in the gas paying situation, so an alternative needs to be found, either using trusted third parties, or zero-confirmation transactions.

But as I mentioned, the fraud that has been carried out to date has very often been done in a manner where it could easily been proven, yet it was still carried out. This would seem to contradict your belief that certainty of being found out is enough to deter bad actors.


In an anonymous situation, I don't see how a fraudster can be caught and punished. If we remove anonymity and are forced to rely on the creditworthiness of the business owner, then we're back to the current banking system, where the largest players are the most trusted and everyone has to rely on them to transfer money.


It sounds like an interesting theory, but there's a lot that we could discover about this, once implemented and fully tested, that would make it unsuitable for most use-cases.

-You have just as much protection in fraud, theft, etc as you do with USD. Theft and fraud are illegal no matter what type of good is involved.
-Bitcoin can be produced using dual-use electric heaters that generate heat while calculating hashes. They can also use waste energy, since hashing devices can be placed any where in the world with electricity, and hashes are much cheaper to send than electricity is to transmit.
-Speculation. You have no idea.
-Companies selling bitcoin they receive in payments on the market helps reduce the speed of bitcoin's price appreciation which helps reduce volatility and bubbles. In the long run companies accepting bitcoin for payment helps increase the value of bitcoin by making it more useful for consumers.

A few thoughts off the top of my head to add to your list:
* If you can do a demonstration of a bitcoin transaction, especially if you can have them download the blockchain app and send them each a small amount of bitcoin, that would be very helpful to demonstrating how it works.
* Combining something like [bridgewalker]( with a payment processor like bitpay leads to a total processing fee of 2.49%, which is less than credit cards, with no volatility risk for the user or the merchant at all, since the money is always held in dollars, and only converted to bitcoins for the transfer.

Any one can create cryptocoins though. The code is open source, and a new blockchain can be created at no cost.


Investors are good for bitcoin, by increasing its market capitalization, which reduces volatility, increasing the number of people that have and therefore can spend bitcoin, and because it leads to them becoming promoters of the technology (since they become stakeholders in its success),
Investor sentiment also tells us how secure regular people will feel about parking their wealth in bitcoin. The more uncertainty there is about its ability to hold its value, the fewer people will take the leap and hold them.


It's possible, but at the moment, I think that since investment is needed for bitcoin to become more widely used, the existence of bitcoin-alts with significant market share being promoted alongside bitcoin hurts adoption.

Bitcoin is money, not a bank. It's up to you to create a bank that houses them. The cash-like quality of bitcoin can be modified by the user. The opposite: a reversible currency being made irreversible is not possible. This means bitcoin gives the maximum in options. That's the quality of real money.


ANY proof of work algorithm will be done by special purpose hardware if the market in mining becomes big enough, so special made mining hardware is an inevitability for a proof-of-work based cryptocurrency that is becoming a globally used currency.
It's good that Bitcoin has already gotten to the phase of using specially made hardware for its mining, because the sooner mining in a proof of work based currency reaches its technological end-state, the better. 
It prevents a well funded attacker from secretly developing the next generation hashing technology and then easily taking over the blockchain. As long as the mining technology that is publicly available is below where it practically could be, honest miners are vulnerable to being leapfrogged.


There is no reason to assume that specially made hardware will lead to "less mining incentives". Mining profits come from mining revenues exceeding the cost to mine, which is wholly dependent on the value of block reward, and the amount of competition. There's no reason to assume specially made hardware will change the ratio between the value of block rewards and the amount of resources expended by miners to mine.


50 seconds is far too long for point of sale. All BTC-based cryptocurrencies will use 0-conf transactions or third party networks that allow instant transactions in most cases. Shorter block times is an advantage in a small percentage of cases, but it also leads to miners with faster internet connections having a bigger advantage over other miners, which encourages centralization of mining, so it's a trade off.


A quick difficulty change allows an attacker who has isolated a node from the rest of the network for a short period of time to change the difficulty to something very low from that node's view. 


Except nothing you argued is an advantage.

It will give no help for arbitrage, since the friction is between fiat -&gt; BTC, and that friction will affect BTC the same as a BTC-alt.

Ownership of currency at one point in time is a fleeting advantage. The only way an individual can exercise their wealth is to spend their currency, and once they've done that, their advantage is gone.
Given a given unit of money will circulate indefinitely, the relative economic power of a holder of a particular percentage of the money supply at a particular point in time will decrease over time as a percentage of total economic power exercised throughout the currency's existence.
The real source of wealth centralization is permanent control over the money supply, by for example being able to inflate the money supply indefinitely, and no one can do that with bitcoin.

It's a superficial innovation as it doesn't change the security model: in all BTC-based blockchains that use proof of work, the parties that dedicate the most resources to producing proof of work decide which transactions get included into the blockchain.
If someone wants to attack two blockchains, they would just divide their economic resources into creating two smaller mining farms, instead of one larger one, and attack both. It doesn't increase security by fragmenting the economic resources of honest miners between several blockchains instead of concentrating them all in one blockchain. 
In fact, it could decrease security overall, as the attacker could concentrate on attacking one blockchain at a time, each of which would be smaller than a blockchain that has a dominant market position.


It's completely irrelevant whether the total supply of bitcoins is 21 or 21 million or 21 trillion. 
If you add a new blockchain that adds 4 times more cryptocoins as there are bitcoins, and it gets adopted, that will result in massive devaluation of each bitcoin and a loss of faith in the market in BTC-based cryptocurrencies being able to maintain their value as new forks continue to be promoted.

I think Bitcoin itself is a great application of the decentralized time-stamp server technology it heralded for the purposes of establishing a currency.
The BTC blockchain technology has many more applications than just currency, and it would be nice to see those being explored instead of just seeing more altcoins being created, mostly as quick money grab.

What I meant is that it will not eliminate microtransactions in the Bitcoin network. It will only eliminate the participation of 'default 0.8.2 clients' in relaying those transactions. No will be forced to use 0.8.2 clients or use the default minimum transaction value setting. If you find a non-0.8.2-default miner, even yourself, to record your sub-54.3 uBTC in a block, it'll be accepted by the network.

Litecoin is incredibly unoriginal, with every thing, minus two changed parameters, exactly the same as bitcoin, and has a market cap at about 1/100th of bitcoin, meaning it has next to no market utility.


There are 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis. What unit of account is currently being used for bitcoin (a bitcoin, which is equal to 100 million Satoshis) is an accounting choice, not a technical property of the bitcoin protocol.


ASICs will get cheaper. Right now GPU mining is only available to those with expensive dedicated GPU rigs any way, so I don't see any advantage of a GPU friendly hashing algorithm.


The litecoin fork's block-target time has very little to do with transaction speed. It uses exactly the same code for transactions, and transactions propagate at exactly the same speed for a given sized network of users.
Confirmation time is not the same thing as transaction speed. More frequent confirmations mean larger transactions are secured more quickly, but it also means more chain forks and wasted hashes due to orphaned blocks, which poses other security risks.
Smaller value transactions, for most purposes, can be assumed confirmed within a few seconds for bitcoin and the copycat blockchains, because as long as a recipient takes a couple of simple precautions, reversing a transaction once it has propagated throughout the network is very difficult.
For these reasons, block generation frequency is not a particularly important factor in how a bitcoin-based currency operates, and not enough of a reason to confuse people with altcoins.

Visa and Mastercard are payment networks, not currencies. They're also closed source, meaning you need permission to use the network, unlike the open source BTC protocol, that any one is able to use.

That's nothing but hype, just like the hype about Scrypt being "CPU friendly", and that GPU mining would never completely replace CPU mining with Scrypt, that was being pumped two years ago.
A Scrypt FPGA has almost been developed, and anything that an FPGA can do, an ASIC can do faster and cheaper.


So which is it: will it work with FPGAs or not? You say "it's not" possible, but this comment makes it seem like you really believe that it's maybe possible.
Power savings are extremely important in mining, since power is the biggest long term cost. Specialized mining rigs that offer significant power savings will take over the creation of proof of work based on any hashing algorithm.

The claims about inflation being better are not based on realistic examples of it giving users an advantage. I don't see any scenario where a user would prefer to hold and receive a currency that sees its per unit value diluted perpetually by inflation over one that doesn't. 
As for PoS, I've yet to see a good argument why it would be better. PoS and PoW each have their own set of advantages, and it's not clear which is better, though I'm guessing PoW is most decentralized and better allows thin client implementations, so is better overall.

I didn't say that at all. I wrote in my first comment in this thread that bitcoin variants work great as testnets, so by all means, keep creating them.
What I said is that if the bitcoin community wants any cryptocurrency to succeed, it's best to focus its efforts on the original cryptocurrency, and not promote the coins of these near-copies as viable additions to the money supply, as that would lead to endless inflation, and eliminate the supposed scarcity of bitcoin-like-currency, and with it, its appeal.


The utility of faster confirmations, if negligible, and it is negligible because no one will wait 2 minutes and 30 seconds or 10 minutes for a confirmation at the point of sale, doesn't even come close to making up for the lower utility of having a tiny network of users, much lower liquidity, much lower security, and much greater volatility.

People who have a lot of bitcoin would be rewarded for their foresight. Any one could try to be an early adopter of bitcoin right now, but most don't, because they don't believe the cost is worth the chance that it will become a more widely accepted currency. Those that risk their money by investing deserve any capital gains that would come if bitcoin does end up being big, just like they would deserve any losses they would face if it doesn't .
More importantly, early adopters would only be able to spend their wealth once. Money continually circulates, so in the long run it is those able to earn a lot on a continuous basis that can spend the most, not those who have a lot of currency at one point in time. Real wealth is much more than just money. Just like now, the wealthiest people in the world would be those with most non-cash assets.

Market capitalization is linked to utility, because the larger the market cap, the less volatile the price, which makes it more useful as a store of value. Also greater market capitalization makes a currency more liquid and widely accepted.
Also, people need to be willing to hold cryptocurrency for it see increases in adoption. If they perceive that cryptocurrency has difficulty holding its value, due to forks continually breaking the market up into smaller pieces, then they will be less likely to buy or accept cryptocurrency for payment, and less likely to hold it if they do receive some.


This is true, but I think most of the BTC-alts provide very little in the way of innovation. Even the most innovative, like Primecoin, don't add anything new from a utility perspective.
They're all based on the same distributed blockchain and peer to peer network idea. As for Litecoin, Feathercoin, and BBQcoin, they are virtual copies of Bitcoin, the use of Scrypt instead of SHA-2 and a different block time notwithstanding.


It's possible, but it's also possible that when regular people see the BTC-based cryptocurrency market is divided between several virtually identical networks, they'll conclude each blockchain will continue to lose value to forks, making it a poor long-term investment / store of value.

Essentially, the only reason people use USD is because taxes in the US have to paid in it. The same goes with other currencies and the countries where where they are required to pay taxes with.


Please note I didn't say they were the same currency. I said they were "virtually identical". You're correct that it's not technically inflation. The effect is very similar to inflation however, as each bitcoin will compete for the same uses as each litecoin/novacoin/BBQcoin, etc. 
After-all, being based on virtually identical software, they have the same traits.
Where they do differ is in the number of merchants/users each network has, and hopefully, this difference will be enough to keep the original and currently dominant BTC-based blockchain as the one that is universally used for transactions.

This is indeed the biggest potential weakness of Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency. 
The best chance that cryptocurrency has, in my opinion, is if Bitcoin maintains its position as the main blockchain for transactions, and attains a strong enough network effect where copycats no longer threaten it. At that point, it will be seen as a safe store of value, despite being open-sourced and easily duplicated, which will encourage mass adoption.

Actually, ten 1-minute confirmations are more secure than one 10-minute confirmation, because the odds of getting 10 confirmations in a row are less than getting 1 confirmation in a row, up to the point where latency does not become excessive.
The only aspect of shorter confirmation time that reduces security is the greater honest work lost to latency. More latency and honest work lost reduces the threshold for a &gt;50% attack.
With 1 minute block times, a &gt;50% attack on BTC would require a 9% lower hashrate, or 77.148 TH/s, compared to the 84.863 TH/s needed now. Given the enormity of BTC's hashrate, I think it can easily afford to lose 9% of its honest work in exchange for faster first confirmations.

It will give no help for arbitrage, since the friction is between fiat -&gt; BTC, and that friction will affect BTC the same as a BTC-alt.
In other words, whatever difference exists between the USD price of BTC at two exchanges will exist between the USD price of a BTC-alt like Litecoin, leaving no opportunity to use it to do arbitrage.


You can do that with Bitcoin already. Having a Bitcoin 2 doesn't help you with the problem of poor fiat liquidity, as the price of any cryptocurrency will be artificially increased in an exchange when fiat cannot be withdrawn, so if you convert your fiat to cryptocurrency, you have to pay an artificially high price to buy the cryptocurrency and take a loss as a result.


Bitcoin-alts that don't offer significant technical advantages (which at the moment is all of them) can only gain market share through hype and misinformation, at the expense of the concept of cryptocurrency as a whole.
Fundamentally, there's no difference between there being two major cryptocurrencies and 100. If there can be two, then there can be three. If there can be three, there can be four, and so on. Pretty soon, none are able to maintain value, because there are clones coming all of the time further fragmenting the market.
The only way I see cryptocurrency being really successful is that the network effect of the dominant one makes it the standard, and leads to most transactions being done in its blockchain despite there being a practically unlimited number of clones. This would give the coins in its blockchain the ability to maintain value, and be seen as a safe store of value, which is required for a commodity to be used as a currency.
The only cryptocurrency that I see having a chance of becoming a standard, and having a credible competitive advantage to clones, is Bitcoin.
All that creating a second Bitcoin network and promoting it does is inflate the supply of BTC-based cryptocurrency. It profits miners in the short run at the expense of those who invested in the coins in the first BTC network.

Great news.
Regarding Ben Laurie's criticism, it fails to grasp the point that proof of work eliminates the need for trusted verifiers. His proposed alternative requires a group of, for example, 50 trusted verifiers to authorize blocks by signing them, instead of hashing nodes authorizing blocks by producing hashes until they discover the inputs to a hash smaller than the difficulty target. 
If a peer to peer currency used his proposed method, the trusted verifiers would quickly become targets of government pressure if the payment network started processing transactions that the government didn't approve of.
Regarding Paul Krugman's criticism, it amounted to [this](


That was true for the small window of time [after the June 2011 crash]( right before he wrote that article, but is it true now?
No, the number of transactions has increased three-fold since June 2012:
A 300% increase in the number of transactions per day in less than a year is phenomenal growth.
If you look at the figures since January 2012, it's even more impressive: a 10-fold increase in the number of transactions per day.
The deflationary argument misses an important point any way: BTC is not replacing dollars, it's adding to them. The more the value of BTC grows, the larger the total money stock becomes, and the more people are incentivized to spend their dollars, so it should be beneficial for the economy as a whole if you take the view that inflation is healthy.

With 1 minute block times, they would probably accept something less than 60 confirmations, because the security of a number of confirmations is not simply a function of the length of time it takes to get that many confirmations. 
In other words, it would require less than one hour of confirmations for a 1 minute block-time chain to get the same level of security* as six confirmations in a 10 minute block-time chain.

I don't see why they'd be useless in real life. We see now that use of bitcoin as a currency for the purchasing of goods/services is increasing. All real-world data indicates that an appreciating currency can have practical applications.


A layman will know the total amount of coins that are scheduled to be generated. It's not exactly a secret that there will be 21 million coins generated. 
I don't see how the coins being released slowly over many years, rather than all at once, will confuse the market and add price volatility. They know, either way, what the currency's total supply will be, and what the current supply is.


People with new hardware don't consume less electricity. They consume less electricity per GH/s. They end up consuming just as much electricity in total, because they end up generating many more GH/s.


It's also speculation that people in poor countries will accept a currency that is diluted by 0.5 percent a year when they have an alternative that has no dilution.


That's speculation. We don't know if there will be lower transaction fees with a constantly inflating currency, or that people would prefer losing 0.5 percent to dilution to paying a small transaction fee.

@_date: 2013-05-13 10:53:49


I could very easily invest in other BTC-based cryptocurrencies if I thought together they could create a vibrant and growing market. The reason I don't is that I believe that the likelihood of BTC-based cryptocurrency as a whole being successful is reduced significantly if there are multiple incompatible protocols, and more being produced every day, diluting the value of the coins in all predecessor blockchains.
Storing value is a vital part of a currency's utility. BTC's appeal is the network-enforced 21 million coin limit, but if there is increasing fragmentation of the BTC community across multiple blockchains, each with more coins, then the currency supply becomes effectively unlimited, making ALL BTC-based cryptocurrency lose its appeal, as its role as a store of value would lose its credibility.
You ignore a very important threat to all currencies: hyper-inflation, by ignoring the fragmentation argument.


That's because you're resentful of BTC early adopters and the greed you perceive that they exhibit. Fragmentation is a real thing. It's one of the few advantages that closed source software has had over open source in gaining adoption. 
By avoiding fragmentation, inferior closed software has managed to become the market standard in many sectors which has given it a network effect advantage and allowed it to maintain its dominant position despite inferiority.
BTC though has a potential to avoid fragmentation because, being a network, even now it has a strong network effect, and could end up becoming seen as the 'protocol' of money transfer. 


I am resentment over people's envy over BTC early adopters making them promote parallel networks and fragmentation, which will hurt BTC-based cryptocurrency as a whole.
I realize that many bitcoin-alt promoters are not motivated by these objectives, but I've seen many of the hypers of the parallel networks express anger toward BTC early adopters and a wish to see their wealth reduced by promoting a new alternative coin.
There is only one place that a path like this can lead: inflation.
Once again, if I for a moment thought it could lead to more adoption and a larger net market cap, I would simply invest in every new bitcoin-alt that emerged. They're extremely cheap.


There's no way I can change your mind. Any argument I make, in your mind, is just confirmation of what you already believe.

The only thing to fear from bitcoin-alts is that it will discredit bitcoin-based cryptocurrency as a whole, as an endless number are pumped out, dividing the community across incompatible networks, while increasing the effective supply of coins which diminishes the perceived scarcity of bitcoin-based cryptocurrency.

So nodes can wait 2-3 confirmations instead of 1. The likelihood that a fork will persist for 2 or more blocks is very low, even with 1 minute block-times. The probability of a transaction being on an orphaned fork decreases exponentially with each block discovered. I'm fairly certain that a transaction that is 3 blocks deep in a 1 minute blockchain has a lower likelihood of being on an orphaned chain than a transaction that is 1 block deep in a 10 minute blockchain.
Reducing the block time increases the resolution of confirmation. Instead having to wait either 10 minutes or 20 minutes, you can choose to wait 3 minutes, or 8 minutes, or 15 minutes. For example, after 15 minutes, you will know that the transaction has been included in 14 blocks, instead of the 1 or 2 blocks that it's likely to be included in now. It's a little bit messier in the first or second confirmation, but it gives people more information and more options.

* The effect of deflation could be different in a multi-currency setting and for non-fiat currencies. There could also be benefits in having a limited number of units when the currency is in a peer-to-peer network, by giving its holders an incentive to invest in developing the technology. There are a lot of unknowns, as bitcoin does not have the same characteristics or exist in the same environment as previous deflationary currencies. What applied to them might not apply to bitcoin.
Even if it has the effect of depressing output, it doesn't mean it will fail. There are many cases of output increasing in countries experiencing deflation.
* Bitcoin can be produced using dual-use electric heaters that generate heat while calculating hashes. Hashing devices can also be placed near sources of excess electricity, like [wind turbines]( and provide proof of work that way, since hashes are much cheaper to send than electricity is to transmit.

Litecoin and the other copycat Bitcoin networks have no first mover advantage, and the shorter block-time is not enough to make up for that disadvantage. I think the shorter block-time is one of the few features that gives the Bitcoin-alts any appeal at all. If it weren't for that, I think they would be even more inconsequential compared to Bitcoin.
It's a feature that Bitcoin could easily adopt, and I think if we see that it likely increases utility more than it reduces it, we should adopt it.

You make a very good point. Most transactions don't need to be secured extremely quickly. In a minority of use-cases though, having faster block-times helps. For example, if you want to deposit BTC at an e-wallet, faster confirmation would get your BTC deposit registered and usable more quickly.
Take this other example: you want to sell BTC at an exchange. MtGox currently requires 6 confirmations before it registers your BTC deposit. With 1 minute block times, they would probably accept something less than 60 confirmations, because security is not simply a function of the length of time it takes to get that many confirmations.
If MtGox requires 10 confirmations in the 1-minute-blockchain for example, you will be able to start selling the BTC 10 minutes after you've made the decision. Speed like this can be helpful.

Once the hyped claims from altcoin miners are deconstructed (GPU proof, ASIC proof), I don't think there's any reason to buy into a much smaller virtual clone.


If an entity is able to successfully attack Bitcoin, then attacking any other proof of work blockchain with 1% of the economic resources dedicated to it is trivial.

Bitcoin is not sum of the parameters used in its first iteration. Bitcoin is a decentralized network where your share of the 21 million coins issued is forever secure from inflation and where transactions will always bypass third party gatekeepers. 
We can make changes to periphery attributes of the network, like block time, and maintain the central properties of it being 1) decentralized, 2) based on proof of work, and 3) limited to 21 million bitcoins.

More than one bitcoin-based blockchain providing the same currency function is confusing, unnecessary and, to the extent that they're adopted, would fragment the network, making it less useful. It also threatens the value of BTC-based cryptocurrency because there is no indication on what the actual limit is on the supply of coins, since it would show there is no barrier preventing additional sets of 20-80 million coins from being adopted and diluting the value of all existing coins.
A single bitcoin-based blockchain for currency transactions co-existing with other currency technologies like Ripple, PayPal, Credit Cards etc is what I consider a healthy ecosystem, not endless fragmentation of BTC-based currency across an ever growing number of nearly identical but incompatible BTC-based protocols that are created by resentful late-adopters to BTC.

It's possible that will happen, but I think there is still a small chance that fragmentation of the BTC-based cryptocurrency market will be the reason it doesn't succeed.


Any flaw in BTC is likely to be seen in alts that are extremely similar to it. BTC has the best chance of succeeding because it has the largest network. I am not denying however that one can make a lot of money from speculating in BTC-alts.


That is in fact the most common argument made by investment analysts critical of Bitcoin. "Anyone can create a clone so bitcoins have no real scarcity" is probably the biggest concern investors have about the concept.


Of course it's speculation. I am not claiming to know the future. I am just explaining why I personally don't support different versions of the Bitcoin blockchain. I see the 21 million limit on bitcoins as one of its most important qualities, and I see a risk that very similar blockchains will eventually discredit the idea that Bitcoin is scarce.


I don't spend much time attacking altcoins. I'm only commenting on it now because there was a thread on the main page about it. 


That is definitely important. All I'm stating is that number of cryptocoins competing in the market is important. Scarcity matters to value. I agree however that the focus should be on promoting Bitcoin, not attacking BTC-alts.

Once &gt;50% of the mining network has adopted the soft-fork, all other miners would need to adopt it as well or else their blocks would be orphaned and they would not be able to earn any bitcoin.

Because if it costs more to develop an ASIC, there will be fewer companies that can produce ASICs, giving them more control over the market. With many ASIC makers, there's a lot of competition, making it more decentralized.


That pie chart is very similar to the one for SHA256-based Bitcoin:
Also, the situation could change significantly when a company develops an ASIC for Scrypt. On top of all of this, you have to keep in mind that all of the Scrypt-based coins have much much smaller markets than Bitcoin, so it's hard to compare.

MtGox is the biggest exchange and I think they could play a big role in whether cryptocoins remain limited to 21 million or if their circulated supply continues to increase with the adoption of very similar blockchains that have their own coins.
Since MtGox is dependent on Bitcoin's success, it could be in their best interest to give up on the small amount of business they could get from supporting Bitcoin-altchains, in exchange for boosting Bitcoin.
Morally, I think it's fine to ask an exchange to support Bitcoin exclusively, because providing exchange services to additional blockchains requires giving them precious screen space on the exchange site.
Giving screen space on MtGox to litecoin reduces Bitcoin's exposure in order to benefit a blockchain that is completely unoriginal, in being almost identical to Bitcoin, has very little actual real world use - with much fewer merchants supporting it than Bitcoin - and undermines Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency by discrediting the idea that there will only ever be 21 million coins.

The only really push for the 'litecoin' fork is from miners making easy money hyping a supposedly original cryptocurrency.
Scrypt being ASIC resistant is not true. Any hashing algorithm can be done more efficiently with specialized hardware. At one time it was claimed that GPUs couldn't do Scrypt more efficiently than CPUs, and now we know they can. If there is ever a big enough market for mining bitcoin-forks with the Scrypt algorithm, then ASICs will be developed for it.
This is irrelevant in any case, as the entire purpose behind the proof of work is to give the group with the majority of the resources dedicated to the network control of the network. Whether that's done with dedicated GPU mining rigs or ASICs is immaterial.
Big profits from mining is eventually going to end with any cryptocurrency that doesn't have a permanent inflation schedule, so relying on supposedly 'fair' mining and hyping it as a currency that is more profitable for miners misses the point that the cryptocurrency needs to get its value from being useful to users, not miners.


Two nearly identical cryptocurrencies would mean there's nothing stopping a third, and a fourth, and a fifth from popping up, which would mean the 21 million coin limit is in effect, irrelevant.  
As soon as difficulty increases, and miners find a new bitcoin-fork with some supposed advantage (let's say a new algorithm), they will hype it as a ground-breaking innovation and worthy addition to the cryptocurrency world, and gull people into buying into it.
It's hype that will lead to endless inflation, and will eventually harm all miners by discrediting bitcoin-technology as a whole.


ASICs will be imported to every country. Nothing can stop a mining market from getting its hands on hardware that it needs.

The sooner mining in a proof of work based currency reaches its technological end-state, the better. It prevents a well funded attacker from secretly developing the next generation hashing technology and then easily taking over the blockchain. As long as the mining technology that is publicly available is below where it practically could be, honest miners are vulnerable to being leapfrogged.

There's no guarantee that it won't depreciate. If it was guaranteed to appreciate, each bitcoin would be worth something like $20 million.


I don't think it's a huge drag. There are trade-offs with every currency, and in bitcoin's case, I think the advantages it gets from having a fixed money supply outweighs the disadvantages, in terms of encouraging spending.
For one, it encourages people from around the world to invest in it, creating a currency that people are familiar with and accept globally. For another, it promotes the increase in the total value of all bitcoins, which increases the maximum number of people that could use it in practice.
There are other advantages I can think of too. 
The data shows it's working too. Despite bitcoin experiencing extreme appreciation over the last year, the number of transactions per day has increased by a factor of 1000% over the last year.
If bitcoin ever becomes a major global currency, then its rate of adoption would slow or even end, as the market would be saturated, and appreciation of bitcoin would slow to almost zero. If bitcoins are spent under current, extreme appreciation conditions, then I think they'll be spent when prices in bitcoin barely change every year.

Why would one argue that scrypt allows for more equality in distribution of hash rate? Scrypt will be performed by ASICs housed in the warehouses of mining companies if the market for BTC-based blockchains that use scrypt ever gets large enough.
You're assuming the mining situation with scrypt-based BTC-alts will remain as it is now even if the market cap is comparable to Bitcoin's, when in fact it's only due to the fact that they have such small market caps that there are not large mining companies and ASICs that dominate their mining.


This is just speculation and wishful thinking. If we're going to speculate, we could also guess that scrypt ASICs could lead to more centralization than SHA256 ASICs, due the former being too expensive to develop and manufacture for smaller companies.

The people claiming it's magnitudes more secure are basically scammers. As I wrote earlier:
Bitcoin-lite (litecoin) has a significantly lower hashrate than bitcoin, making it MAGNITUDES less secure.
IF it had the same hashrate as bitcoin, then its more frequent block generation would make double spend attacks by parties with significantly less than 50% of the total hashrate harder in a given space of time, because the probability of getting a consecutive number of blocks faster than the rest of the network decreases with each additional block discovered in that space of time.
On the other hand, a &gt;50% attack actually becomes EASIER with more frequent blocks, because more of the honest work is lost to latency when block times are shorter.
tl;dr bitcoin-lite is currently much less secure than bitcoin. If it had an equal hashrate to bitcoin, it would be more secure from small double spend attacks from parties with much less than 50% of the hashrate, and less secure from large &gt;50% attacks.
I personally prefer shorter block times, but this is a minor advantage IMO, and doesn't make up for the insignificant network size of bitcoin-lite. We can't abandon a cryptocurrency and start from scratch every time a near clone is created with a minor protocol improvement. That would destroy investor confidence and prevent significant adoption.
It's better to change the bitcoin protocol, which we can do since it's open source, when we find a feature we like.

Resetting the block chain and every one’s bitcoin holdings to zero every time there is a minor protocol improvement would result in constant upheavals and destroy investor confidence in bitcoin-like currency as a whole.
If there is widespread support for a change, then I think almost every one would change. Even if they don't, it's better to fork the chain than erase people's bitcoin holdings with a block chain reset.
Also, sCrypt is untested as a cryptographic scheme and prone to centralized mining due to high barriers to producing an ASIC, so the bitcoin-lite protocol is not the one that should be adopted.

2.1 quadrillion Satoshis.


It has faster block generation, not faster transaction. Transaction propagation happens at exactly the same speed at a given number of nodes. There are dozens of other BTC-based currencies that have faster block generation than BTC. 
Faster block generation leads to the highest level of transaction security being reached more quickly, but reduces what that maximum level of security is, and encourages centralization of mining.
It will give no help for arbitrage, since the friction is between fiat -&gt; BTC, and that friction will affect BTC the same as a BTC-alt.
In other words, whatever difference exists between the USD price of BTC at two exchanges will exist between the USD price of a BTC-alt like Litecoin, leaving no opportunity to use it to do arbitrage.

A Bridgewalker account holds an amount of bitcoin that adjusts so that the value is constant in terms of Euros, so that changes in the price of bitcoin don't affect you, while you are still able to take advantage of bitcoin to make international transfers and anonymous online payments. 
It costs about 0.6% for the conversion between Euros and bitcoin, so that is what you end up paying on every transfer, which is still excellent for international payments.

No, after a tx with a sufficient fee has gotten a propagation confirmation, the chance of a successful double spend drops to the percentage of the network hashrate rate that is cooperating with the attacker, which is likely to be very low. Given the odds that a double spend attempt on a tx that has propagated will fail, in many cases, a tx with zero block confirmations and only propagation confirmation is secure enough.
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:31:47
Modifying the block difficulty makes blocks easier to find, which results in blocks being found at a faster rate. The probability of a miner with a given hashrate finding a given block does not change when the difficulty decreases though.
If a miner has 1% of the network hashrate, they have a 1% probability of finding any given block. This doesn't change with block-time/difficulty.


The risk of accepting a transaction with few confirmations is that an attacker will be able to create a consecutive number of blocks, which contain a double-spend, in secret, and faster than the rest of the network, and release them all at once, thus canceling the first transaction after the recipient had already believed it was confirmed.
Let me give you an example:
Mallory, a malicious party, wants to defraud someone of bitcoin. He targets a bitcoin e-wallet service, run by Alice, that considers a deposit of BTC to be confirmed after only 1 confirmation.
Mallory creates a transaction (tx 1) sending BTC from one of his bitcoin addresses (A) to another bitcoin address (B), which belongs to Alice, in order to be credited with a BTC deposit in the account he holds at Alice's e-wallet service.
Unknown to Alice, Mallory had secretly created a transaction (tx 2) sending the same BTC at address A that he had sent address B (which Alice controls), to address C, which he controls, and had been secretly working on blocks that contains tx 2 and not tx 1.
After Alice sees tx 1, she waits for one confirmation, and then credits Mallory's account with BTC.
As soon as Mallory has seen that he has been credited by Alice with a BTC deposit in his e-wallet account, he withdraws the BTC to one of his own bitcoin addresses (F). The withdrawn BTC come from another one of Alice's bitcoin addresses (E).
So now Alice has had BTC debited from her bitcoin address E, and the same amount of BTC credited to her bitcoin address B, while Mallory has had BTC debited from his address A, and the same amount of BTC credited to his address F.
However, before tx 1 gets two confirmations, Mallory gets lucky, and is able to find two blocks in secret which contain tx 2 instead of tx 1. He releases the two blocks, and they are accepted by the network as the authoritative addition to the chain. This causes a chain reorganization that orphans the confirmed block that contained tx 1. 
Now, Mallory has had BTC transferred from address A to address C, both of which he owns, AND he has had BTC credited to his address F. Alice meanwhile has had no BTC credited to her addresses, while BTC has been debited from her address E.
This is a double spend attack.
The key security risk for Alice in all of this is Mallory's ability to get 2 confirmations in a row faster than the rest of the network. The probability of finding consecutive blocks is exactly proportional to a block generator's share of the total network hashrate. If their hashrate is equal to 1% of the network hashrate, then they have a 1/10,000 chance of finding two blocks consecutively (1/100^2). It makes no difference in all of this what the block time is.

This suggests you don't have a good counter argument to my points.

Each additional block adds 80 bytes of data to the blockchain, so moving Bitcoin to a 1 minute time would add 115.2 KB of data to the blockchain per day. Relative to blocks with GBs of data each, which Bitcoin will eventually have, I think that's quite insignificant, and worth taking on for having more quickly secured confirmations and higher confirmation resolution.
I don't see the significant drawbacks here.

Here's Gavin Andresen's blog post stating that the 1MB block cap will eventually be replaced, which includes links to other discussions on it:


A hard fork is controversial, but hard forking to replace the 1MB block size limit with something has been agreed to by the core developers and early community since Satoshi was on the forums. He himself agreed that the 1MB limit was only a temporary measure until something better could be found, and discussed various alternatives.


Green addresses are useful, but are not a solution for every situation in which you need fast confirmations. 
For one, green addresses require storing your BTC at a third party wallet, which has security risks. For another, it reduces privacy, because a green address cannot be newly generated for each transaction.


Satoshi's initial release was experimental, and I doubt he got every parameter right. 
We've seen, thanks to the natural experiments that the bitcoin-alts have provided, that shorter block times are feasible. Given the track record, I think it's very unlikely that we couldn't safely increase block generation frequency to faster than one block every 10 minutes.
Right now, about 1 in 100 blocks in bitcoin is orphaned, suggesting a latency of six seconds and 1% of honest work lost. Based on this, I think we can project that 10% of honest work would be lost if BTC's block time was changed to 1 minute, which as far as I can see, would have a tolerable effect on BTC's security from &gt;50% attacks.
@_date: 2013-06-27 06:01:16
I think the block time is not particularly important, as propagation confirmation is usually sufficient in most business settings, and when it's not, waiting 10-20 minutes for 1-2 confirmation is not a problem (when you have to ship to product for example). I do think Bitcoin would benefit slightly from a reduced block time though, because if you only needed the security of one 1-minute confirmation, you could get it.

I think a faster confirmation blockchain does provide an advantage in a situation when you need a confirmation quickly (because you only need to wait 2.5 minutes instead of 10 minutes), but that advantage is small, since in most situations, you don't need to worry about a double spend attack and can accept zero-confirmation transactions, and it comes at the cost of more splits, orphan blocks and bloat (from the 80 byte headers).
In real world situations, bitcoin is immeasurably more useful than any fork, as it has a much larger economy, more liquidity, more supporting infrastructure, etc.
Hype from people mining and speculating in bitcoin forks is the only possible explanation I can think of for any one wanting to buy coins of a bitcoin-fork rather than bitcoin.

In the short term, until there is a difficulty readjustment, which happens every 2016 blocks, yes blocks are generated more quickly when the global hashrate increases.
In the long run, the speed at which blocks are generated doesn't increase, but the number of blocks you need to wait before you can assume a transaction is verified does decrease, as a larger global hashrate makes it harder to reverse each block (double spend).

This is a good argument. I propose we first create a Bitcoin testnet with the 1 minute block time and throw everything at it. If it works, and if after a lot of discussion and mathematical modeling, it seems like the drawbacks and risks are few, then I think we should seriously consider adopting it.
One reason I think a 1 minute block time would be OK is that a lot of Bitcoin-alts are using shorter block times and it hasn't broken mining. In these parallel networks, we already have good experiments to gain observations from.

I think the threat is overstated. The Bitcoin-alts like Bitcoin-lite have virtually no supporting economy. They are basically only get rich schemes and add little to no utility. Most of their users are also major Bitcoin supporters and use Bitcoin as well.
The threat they pose is to the credibility of Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency's digital scarcity. Being open source and yet not having the value of its coins threatened by clones and near-clones is the challenge that Bitcoin is attempting to meet, and has so far succeeded in doing.
The single most effective thing Bitcoin could do against its copycats is change pricing to mBTC so people no longer think they can get in on a 'cheaper' investment by buying coins in little used forks created for speculation purposes.

My point is that Bitcoin itself can be forked into different versions, and this doesn't have the disadvantage of increasing the total coin supply by adding 84 million or 332 million or whatever coins.

People have to understand that certain individuals with ulterior motives will use situations like this to spread FUD about Bitcoin, key organizations within it, and key individuals in its development.
There is absolutely no indication that the Bitcoin Foundation is about to support adding coin taint, that Bitcoin is no longer working (the principal behind an obscure altcoin made this claim, along with a promotion of his alt - this is the same alt that recently claimed it had solved the 51% attack only to have that claim exposed as patently false), or that Mike Hearn is silently gaining support for black/red listing to implement it against the will of the majority.
The issue is not Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Foundation, or key developer Mike Hearn, whose work on BitcoinJ made the Multibit client possible. The issue is whether the US government is going to change its mind about Bitcoin being legal and decide to ban it, and offer a blacklisted alternative as a replacement. That's it.

"computer money" is new money which you use with your computer or phone. you do not keep computer money in your pocket, but it is written in the book of computer money that you own the computer money. you can use it to pay for things just like you use money, but instead of giving the other person paper, the fact that the computer money has changed hands is written in the book of computer money. now everyone knows that the money is not yours anymore and it is theirs, so they can give you the thing you wanted or do work for you.
this book of computer money is kept in many places and you can also keep the book of computer money. this means that no bad people can hide the book, change what is in the book, or add something to the book that is not real. if they did that, everyone would find out because they all have the book, too.
your computer money is safe in your computer because it has a lock, which only you have the key for. no bad people can take your computer money because they do not have the key to open your lock. if you want to send computer money to another person you take off your lock and put their lock on it. 
if you have no computer money, there are places where you can give the other person paper money for computer money. you can also make computer money by doing very hard problems which take a computer a long time to do. if your computer finds the answer to a problem then you get a little bit of computer money. one day there will be no more computer money left to make, and you will have to buy computer money from other people. 
computer money is great because no one can stop you from giving it to any person you want, even if they live in a far away place. no one has to know who you give your computer money to or who you get it from. no bad people can take away your computer money, or give you computer money that is not real.

The GBP undermines the USD to the extent that it's adopted. There's no possibility of that happening to any great degree right now because the latter has exclusionary rights to tax the American economy. 
Without its role as coin of the realm for taxes, every additional paper currency that is introduced in the US would compete in the same space as the USD, and would depress the USD's value in proportion to gains in its market share.


I totally agree. This would be useful info to have. We could fine-tune bitcoin based on what we learn.


They're identical in the first category too. The only possible advantage of any of the existing proof-of-work alternatives is the second category: Comfort levels of confirmation time.
I just can't see how the advantage of a better confirmation time can be any thing but negligible, since for most transactions, zero-confirmation notification of transaction propagation is sufficient.

I don't think big money is interested in a Bitcoin near-duplicate. The effect that Bitcoin-alts could have though is to make some big investors lose interest in the entire Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency space, because if Bitcoin can be copied and that copy can get market share, then the same thing could happen to currency based on Bitcoin as well.

LTC is just a slightly modified version of Bitcoin. Its name, 'Litecoin', evokes the idea of something new, but in reality, it's more a parallel Bitcoin network than a new digital currency. It's superficially innovative, with a codebase that's almost identical to Bitcoin's.
Its differences: a shorter block time and the use of a different hashing algorithm to provide proof of work, are just parameter adjustments, that not only can be adopted by Bitcoin relatively easily from a technical standpoint, but also don't provide it with any significant advantages, and possibly some minor disadvantages.
So no, it is not the Facebook to BTC's MySpace. Bitcoin is not a proprietary social network. It's an open source protocol, that others can use freely and build on top of, like TCP/IP or HTTP.

I'm in. I'm thinking once we have the message and catchy movement name crafted and 'switch date' picked, we post a link on Reddit to a post on bitcointalk.org forum with a poll that Bitcoin community members can vote on, to indicate whether they support the switch.
Here is what's needed for a successful switch in my opinion: 
1) statements by several influential people in the Bitcoin community, like Gavin for example, expressing support for the switch IF a threshold of support is met in the greater Bitcoin community
2) an indication that a majority of the Bitcoin community supports the switch
3) statements by major organizations in the Bitcoin community expressing support for the change IF a supermajority of the Bitcoin community supports it. I think if we had the support of these organizations, it would be enough:
* the Bitcoin Foundation
* several large exchanges, like MtGox, Bitstamp and BTCChina
* the major payment processors, Coinbase and Bitpay
4) a formal vote on bitcointalk.org, held by a trusted group like the Bitcoin Foundation, asking if Bitcoin community members support the switch, with a minimum, of for example, 70% of members needing to be in support for the switch to happen.

That's not due to the hashing algorithm that is used to show proof of work. That's a result of the amount of competition in BTC mining, which would have affected mining profitability regardless of whether the hashing algorithm was ASIC friendly, like SHA256, or not, like sCrypt.

Bitcoin's price volatility has been declining over time:




@_date: 2013-06-15 01:05:05
But you might not know you want to sell BTC beforehand. Circumstances, like a price-run up, could persuade you to sell your BTC. If you don't like storing your BTC at 3rd party wallets, then storing it at MtGox permanently to have it ready to sell at a moment's notice is not an option.
A 10 minute deposit time versus 60 minutes is significant in this case in my opinion. 
The MtGox example is just one of many that I can think of too. Again, I agree that this isn't a big deal either way, as depositing BTC at sites makes up a minority of the uses of BTC, and in most cases a one hour confirmation is ok anyway as it takes more time than that to ship, but I think it would still be a protocol improvement overall.
If Bitcoin can get an advantage by simply tweaking a parameter, I don't see why not.

If ASICs are expensive and you're a small player, you can just buy fewer ASICs. If buying ASICs is profitable when investing $100,000, it should also be profitable when investing $1,000.
There is some cost advantage when buying bulk, but from what I've seen with the ASICs so far, it's not much, especially when you can organize group buys efficiently using bitcoin payments and signing (which does away with a lot of the transactional and administrative costs of large numbers of people each buying small amounts of something).


I think this will happen over time, as initial capital costs for ASIC fabrication plants are paid off and production scales up.

The trust free payment channel has to be setup with each party you want to transact with, and will require at least one transaction with that party when the channel is terminated. Unless you plan on buying $2,000 worth of hot dogs over the course of your life from the hot dog vendor you pass by on the street, $20 fees is too much to use a trust fee off the chain payment channel with him.
Other solutions are purely theoretical and can't be relied upon as a substitude for what we have now. Based on what is available now, a future of off the chain transactions is large service providers like MtGox handling accounts, just like banks.

In effect, it makes bitcoin less scarce. Like other bitcoin-variants, litecoin is virtually identical to bitcoin, so it competes for the same uses. To the extent that litecoin or any other bitcoin-variant is used in place of bitcoin, the demand for bitcoin decreases.


You're not just suggesting accounting books be copied and not be used though. You're suggesting they compete against bitcoin as stores of value. Endless copies of these accounting books, and their adoption, would mean none of them will be regarded as safe stores of value, since each additional copy would reduce demand for the ones preceding it.

The market cap indicates it's not very popular or pervasive, but it's ahead of all the other altcoins because it had, relative to the rest, a lot support when starting up and maintained support by being supportive of bitcoin rather than antagonistic toward it. 
Many posts are deleted here because one way a few of its producers find new buyers is by advertising it extensively in bitcoin discussion boards with semi-spammy posts.
I think it's disliked by many because the only way cryptocurrency is going to succeed is if the community works to improve the software of the original peer-to-peer network and reward those who invest in it, rather than creating new blockchains that reset every one's holdings to zero and threaten to dilute the value of the coins they have on the original blockchain by creating tens of millions of new coins in a new blockchain that compete in the same space with virtually identical software.

The same thing was claimed about GPU mining versus CPU mining on Scrypt, and now we know that GPU mining is many times more efficient than CPU mining.

I agree 100%.

It's nice to see these well laid out explanations of the current state of the technology and the options available.
I think CoinJoin could be useful for people other than criminals. One legitimate use it has is to give people greater control over their privacy. As Hearn points out, with merge avoidance, your privacy is only guaranteed if the sender cooperates:


Plus, in less free countries, the ability to trace coins, which Hearn acknowledge merge avoidance doesn't protect against:


could prevent people from using Bitcoin to circumvent laws that most people around the world consider repressive.
Without CoinJoin being a common way to do transactions, the legal risks for those who do opt into CoinJoin, and the odds of CoinJoin being made illegal, are expanded (if a million people use it, it's less likely to be ruled illegal than if a few hundred use it), so there's an argument for making it a default, or at least a very prominently displayed and easy to use option.

First of all, this is wrong:


Bitcoin-lite's mathematical puzzle can very much be solved with graphics chips (GPUs). When it was launched, it was claimed to be GPU proof, but that turned out to be false. Now it's claimed to be ASIC proof, which I'd bet will turn out to be false.
I can't imagine there is any hashing algorithm that can't be done more efficiently with specialized hardware than with general purpose hardware, even one that's memory-hard.
Also, x-posting from another thread, I'd like to float this naming convention for altcoins:
Attach the first half of the altcoin's current name to 'bitcoin' as a suffix to create a new name, like 'bitcoin-nova'.
The altcoins would thus be named:
This way there would be a strong indication that these cryptocurrencies are derivatives of bitcoin and work almost exactly the same way. I think it would give bitcoin the homage it deserves and would be a better representation of what the altcoin protocols/blockchains are.
Altcoins that have significant differences in their codebase from bitcoin would continue being called by their current names:

I disagree that they have control over the bitcoin network, because I perceive 'control' being defined differently than you.

If you're going to rely on a centralized BTC-bank, then all of your clients/customers have to use the same BTC-bank for you to be able to transfer BTC to them without using a network transaction.
The alternative is a number of BTC-banks that accept each other's BTC-promissory-notes, so you're not bound to just one bank. In this case, you're trapped within that network of banks, and any new BTC-bank has to get permission from the other banks to be able to participate in this banking network.
With BTC-promissory-notes, you also have to account for the different level of trust in each BTC-bank backing it. Their value will differ depending on the perceived credit risk of the backing party. In other words, BTC-backed digital credit issued by BTC-banks, as a class, is not fungible. I'm fairly certain I would not run my site with this type of BTC economy in place. 
I also don't know how cryptographic auditing measures are going to prevent BTC-banks from running away with people's BTC. Being able to prove that fraud occurred is not going to deter some parties from engaging in fraud. We have near absolute proof of many cases of fraud by BTC services, because the fraud was carried in a way in which it was certain to be discovered. This indicates to me that being able to prove, after the fact, that a party committed fraud is not enough to discourage it.

But it's not ASIC proof. It's just a matter of time and money to design hardware specialized to do it. The requirement to use memory doesn't avoid the fact that specialized hardware can do the algorithm faster and more efficiently than a general purpose processor and memory setup.


The purpose of requiring miners to run any hashing algorithm is to require the dedication of economic resources to the network in order to control it. This prevents a small malicious actor from taking control through spoofing multiple identities, as economic resources can't be spoofed.
The economic resources can either be fragmented between different types of ASICs, to run different algorithms for different bitcoin-forks, or focused on one type of ASIC, running the same algorithm. It makes no difference. The point is, it's costly to mine, and the group dedicating the majority of the resources will control the network(s).


All it requires is convincing hype (like 'ASIC-proof mining'), and people who missed out on the price growth of the last bitcoin-fork, for people to buy into any new fork.


Not all of the forks will succeed, but eventually some will. Right now most miners looking for a fork are focused on litecoin, but that can quickly change, especially if a new fork comes along with some spiffy-sounding but essentially negligible innovation, and litecoin mining becomes more competitive and less profitable.

It's not just Bitcoin-lite (Litecoin). There are a host of copycats claiming to provide a substantial advantage over Bitcoin due to "faster confirmations". 
It's 95% hype, but from a marketing perspective, it is somewhat effective, and has resulted in them getting some market share (still a tiny fraction of Bitcoin's, but more than negligible) despite being much less useful than Bitcoin in every way. In the long run, some of these Bitcoin-alts could end up getting significant market share.
This would not be good for BTC-based cryptocurrency as a whole, because with the market fragmented between several nearly identical blockchains, investors will have no interest in buying and holding cryptocoins.
They would lose interest because open-source software can be copied, so the only value investors see in a currency network based on open source software is that the network effect gives it an advantage over copycats. 
If the market fragments, that would show that the network effect is not a strong enough force in cryptocurrency to allow for open-source blockchains to maintain market share and value over the long run against forks.
For this reason, I strongly support reducing Bitcoin's block time. It would slightly improve the utility of Bitcoin, and greatly improve the marketing message against copycat forks. 
The only real protocol advantage, however small, that BTC-alts have over BTC, is the faster block time, as Scrypt is not an advantage at all, so making this change would substantially reduce the possibility of the market fragmenting, and thereby increase Bitcoin's chances of remaining the standard protocol for open source currency and achieving mainstream adoption.

There isn't a large or liquid enough market for XRPs to calculate a market cap for them. Simply multiplying the prevailing market price by how many XRPs there are doesn't give a good indication of how much the market would actually pay for all of them, because there are very few people buying them right now and very few places people with XRPs can offer them to the market.
Even if not an accurate figure for the market cap, the current price does still show that XRPs are doing quite well, considering Ripple has next to no activity right now.
This is yet another argument supporting the case for using a smaller denomination (like Millicoin), or redefining a Bitcoin as a mBTC, likely being good for Bitcoin's market capitalization.

Source? I believe it uses mining for initial distribution then transitions to PoS.


sCrypt is no longer viable on CPUs, as the earnings are less than the power consumption. Lower power consumption on GPUs will just mean people will be able to afford to run more GPUs. It's not an energy saving feature for a proof of work algorithm.


This will probably be disproven just as the initial claim that sCrypt couldn't be done on GPUs was disproven. FPGA development has already started, and I would bet an FPGA hasher will end up much more efficient than GPUs for hashing.


So either the currency stops growing, in which case it's not a good investment, or it keeps growing, in which case sCrypt mining provided no unique qualities over SHA256 mining, since it will also be done on ASICs.
In conclusion: almost every thing claimed about sCrypt will eventually be found to have been hype.

A renowned security expert finding no vulnerabilites in bitcoin inspires confidence.
One thing I noticed is that Kaminsky seems hung up on the idea of regular people being able to run bitcoin nodes and miners with regular hardware. 
He previously criticized the fact that industrial scale nodes would be needed if bitcoin were ever to be used on a massive scale, but he seems to have come around to accepting this eventuality by finding consolation in the fact that even if regular people couldn't run nodes normally, they could run nodes in the event of an emergency like if those few individuals who regularly ran nodes were being forced to shut them off.
Now he's critical of the fact that bitcoin's hashing algorithm will only allow people running specialized hardware to mine, and makes it uneconomical for the average person.
The point of bitcoin is not that it won't be dominated by specialized hardware though. It's been understood from the beginning that general purpose hardware was only going to be used in the early days of bitcoin and that it was inevitable that the network would be supported by specialists overtime. Nakamoto acknowledged this. Memory-hard hashing algorithms like Scrypt are a band-aid and will only delay specialized hardware. 
This doesn't matter though, as the point of bitcoin is that there's nothing except resource limitations preventing individuals from contributing to the network.
Whether that means buying ASICs or paying for the large amounts of bandwidth needed for running a node on a scaled up bitcoin network, the relationship between cost and contribution to the network will remain, and the global, unregulated way in which those contributions can be made will be guaranteed.

Its proposed solution cements any blocks a node receives that are more than five blocks deep, so that they cannot be replaced in a reorganization by an alternate chain with more proof of work. 
This was rejected as a solution to the 51% attack because it means that a node that is isolated from the main network and downloads a blockchain segment that is five or more blocks long that doesn't exist on the main chain will be unable to join the main network.
This can also be exploited by an attacker, who could isolate a node from the main network long enough for them to download an alternative five block-long blockchain segment, and disable their ability to get back on the correct chain with a reorganization.
Also, with cementing in place, if there is a 51% attack, it creates a network split as new nodes download the attacker's chain while old nodes use the older chain.

OSs created by Amazon, Facebook, etc are not currencies. They can fragment all they want and their utility doesn't decrease (or least not substantially). Bitcoin's fragmentation hits at its most important quality: a store of value. Each fragmentation adds another set of millions of cryptocoins, and dilutes the cryptocoins in already existing blockchains.


I certainly see that as a potential advantage of Bitcoin-alts, but I still think that the advantage of one blockchain become the market standard, similar to TCP/IP, outweighs the advantages of diversity in this particular case, seeing as how the entire premise of Bitcoin based-cryptocurrency is that you can have digital scarcity without IP laws.

Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to be a "digital cash", which is at the opposite end of the spectrum from illiquid precious metals. From what I've seen, most of the investor interest in Bitcoin is as a potential replacement for other payment mechanisms, not as a high powered money that is difficult to move around. Using it as a currency for everyday transactions is how it is mostly being used (SatoshiDice, Bitcoinstore, etc).
Scarcity alone isn't enough to give it value. The scarcity of BTC is also not a unique advantage, since a copycat blockchain can be created at no cost. What can maintain its advantage over any rivals is its network effect, which is sustained and expanded by its use as a transaction currency.

At one point I would have recommended having a standalone bitcoin payment page that other pages of your website do not link to, and advertising that page separately in bitcoin forums for those who want to pay for the type of services you offer independently, if you're concerned about an experimental payment option possibly tarnishing your brand.
Now, with awareness of bitcoin at much higher levels, and it achieving a level of legitimacy in the wider, non-bitcoin public, owing to a lot of media coverage, I think having it displayed as a payment option alongside all of the standard ones could give a company in any industry a reputational boost by appearing cutting edge.

If your main concern is what people care about, then Bitcoin's no inflation should be preferred, as it means the value of people's coins increases over time with steady adoption. Increasing value is what people care about most.


I don't see how that is a risk vector. Transaction fees in Bitcoin will be substantial if it succeeds as it's hoped it will, which means miners will be well compensated, and not want to sell their hardware for cheap. The mining reward also reduces gradually, so by the time the block subsidy goes to zero, new mining technology will be out that will make the hardware purchased in the higher subsidy days uncompetitive.




People have no choice but to pay transaction fees. If they don't, miners don't include their transactions in blocks.


There doesn't need to be higher transaction fees, just more transactions. If Bitcoin succeeds, there will be.

If there's any thing that could possibly make people lose confidence in cryptocurrency, it's an endless cycle of miners hyping new nearly identical bitcoin-forks when mining difficulty in the original blockchain gets too high.
Despite your hype, none of the proof-of-work based bitcoin-forks have any notable differences from bitcoin as they use 99.99% of its codebase. 
Swapping out SHA256 for Scrypt doesn't change the fact that it's using exactly the same proof of work security model, and reducing the block time has few real world advantages given that no one is going to wait for 2.5 minutes or 10 minutes in a point of sale situation, and people instead opt for zero-confirmation instant transactions.
Giving it a new name doesn't change the fact that not only does it work identically to bitcoin in almost every way, it has the disadvantage of having little to no real world economic activity and supporting infrastructure, very few developers keeping it up to date, and little to no liquidity.
People are better off using the main network, even if it's harder for miners to make easy money when difficulty increases.

All of the bitcoin-alts, like bitcoin-lite, were created for miners. **They're a form of inflation, since the more cryptocoins are produced, the more diluted the investment into each will be.**
I wrote this a month ago, and it already looks like it's happening with the surge in interest in bitcoin-feather ('feathercoin'):
You're going to see the following cycle:
Mining gets too difficult for some miners. A lot of people who missed out on being early adopters in bitcoin are easily convinced to buy into a new supposedly original cryptocurrency, so miners start mining it.
In actuality, the new cryptocurrency is bitcoin copied almost entirely, with only a couple of changed parameters.
These parameters are something like a different hashing algorithm, and a different block time.
The new cryptocurrency has a new name, like litecoin, obfuscating the fact that it's virtually identical to bitcoin, just without the economy.
So people buy into it, miners profit, and hype it more, perhaps copying some of the services that exist for bitcoin, and eventually difficulty goes up, and then miners look for a new bitcoin-fork to jump into and hype.
Rinse and repeat, and soon people don't trust the whole cryptocurrency market. People only like it now because it has a 21 million coin limit. With endless fragmentation of the cryptocurrency economy between virtually identical forks of bitcoin, that appeal is gone, as the scarcity of the coins, in effect, is diminished.
Now, I don't think it will happen, because of bitcoin's network effect, but I see this as the biggest of the small risks facing bitcoin right now.

Block size is incredibly important, but the source of the block size problems is the tens of thousands of transactions happening each day, compared to which, the extra data added by more frequent blocks is negligible.
Each additional block adds 80 bytes of data to the blockchain, so moving bitcoin to 1 minute blocks would add 115.2 KB of data to the blockchain per day. Relative to blocks with GBs of data each, which bitcoin will eventually have, I think that's quite minor, and worth taking on for having faster confirmations.

The developers are planning on hard forking for 1MB. There is currently a lot of discussion on what the best solution is to replace the 1MB cap.
Blocks are already getting close to the 1MB cap, and soon afterward, BTC will need a hard fork and protocol change in order to maintain its growth.
A hard fork was successful done in the change from versions 0.7.2 and earlier to 0.8.1, so I think it's doable.


It doesn't have to generate coins faster. Coin generation can be adjusted so that 2.5 coins are generated per block, instead of 25, leading to the same 25 coins being generated every 10 minutes.
The number of blocks between reward halving time can be increased by 10-fold as well, to keep it at 4 years. Nothing in Bitcoin's reward schedule needs to change to change the block time.


Block time though is not an important part of the implied contract, because it doesn't affect any one's wealth, and it doesn't affect the decentralization of BTC. 
I don't know if the majority could be convinced to support it. I think it depends on how it's presented and explained.


Faster is generally better. Even from a purely marketing P.O.V., saying you have 1 or 2 minute block times, and full confirmation in 6-12 minutes sounds more appealing than 10 minute block times and 60 minute confirmations.
I could think of some cases where a shorter block time would actually be more convenient too, like depositing BTC at an exchange, where you would only need to wait, for example 10 minutes for the deposit to be accepted, instead of 60 minutes. This makes BTC-based business faster, which I think is important given the value of speed.


True, but how much more difficult?

Inflation would change a core property of Bitcoin and therefore would be unlikely to be adopted. I think it's unlikely that inflation would give a Bitcoin clone an advantage over Bitcoin.

I should clarify. What I mean is that if linux fragments but the forks remain compatible with other distributions, it doesn't lose utility. If it becomes incompatible, then it does.
However even in the latter, the loss of utility from the fragmentation of linux is nothing compared to the loss of utility that comes from a BTC-based cryptocurrency losing value as a result of fragmentation of the market.


I agree that innovation adds value to the system, but the current BTC-alts are virtually identical to Bitcoin, being forks of the source code, and only different in a couple parameters. 
I personally think that each additional blockchain launched, reduces the value of the preceding ones more due to fragmentation/dilution of the market with millions of new cryptocoins being offered to potential investors and currency holders, than it increases it as a result of the experimental data provided by testing out new parameter values, simply because the innovation has been quite limited thus far (with the major exception of Namecoin and the minor exceptions of PPCoin and Primecoin).
We haven't seen the negative effects of fragmentation much so far, because the entire BTC-based cryptocurrency market is growing so fast as a result of the growing stature of Bitcoin, that even with fragmentation, alt blockchains have continued to see their value increase. Adoption at some point in time will end its rapid growth phase however, and at that point, fragmentation could pose a risk.

No, but unfortunately every one is pricing bitcoin in units of bitcoin, instead of bitcents or millibits.

I'm telling a broker that is heavily dependent on the success of BTC for its revenues to not do something that would hurt BTC.
I don't think a fragmented market for BTC-based cryptocurrencies will ever have a chance of being as large as a market where BTC is secure as the universal protocol of money exchange. It's in MtGox's best interest to try to prevent fragmentation from happening.


Why shouldn't BTC be afraid of competition? I think the freedom to compete is good, but it goes both ways. Bitcoin users are allowed to compete too.
There is nothing anti-competitive about asking a private company to choose to make Bitcoin the exclusive cryptocurrency they trade, instead of supporting numerous near-copycats. Doing this is one way of competing against competitors.

Because it's the last thing an open source currency network needs: evidence that a blockchain that's identical to it apart from two changed parameters can take market share from it. Investors would conclude that being open source and easily duplicated, cryptocoins have no real scarcity.

Bitcoin variants like litecoin are useful experiments in trying out different features, but as currencies, they're too unoriginal to be useful. They're identical to bitcoin in every way, except for one or two changed parameters.
If we keep pumping out bitcoin-near-clones, each with 21-84 million coins in its blockchain, and a significant portion of the bitcoin community adopts them, then the idea of a 21 million limit on the money supply would effectively be gone, and the appeal of bitcoin-based cryptocurrency would be diminished as a result.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:42:12
Bitcoin is the only currency that has been adopted to any appreciable degree. Litecoin has a tiny economy and is mostly bought for speculation and out of curiosity. If litecoin or any of the other bitcoin-variants gain significant market share, that would encourage others to create new blockchains and promote them, since they would want to also be 'early adopters'. 
It would only be a matter of time before the supply of bitcoin-like-currency is, in the eyes of most people who assess the market, not capped, and that would make it lose its appeal.

I'm jokingly referring to litecoin and feathercoin as Testnet 6 and 9, due to the fact that bitcoin-alts like them are identical to Bitcoin apart from one or two changed parameters, and therefore could be argued to mostly have value as Testnets for Bitcoin to try different parameters.

I do agree with your article however. BTC has the potential to help the vulnerable and marginalized classes by giving them advanced financial capabilities at a very low cost.

I haven't seen any comprehensive proposals that describe a practical proof of work requirement that favors general purpose machines over ASICs. It's nice in theory, but until a plan is offered and analyzed, we can't take it as a given that it's even possible.


I don't know if it would be possible to adjust the number of SHA2 rounds randomly and be able to adjust difficulty to target particular block time, or if this would actually be immune to ASICs, let alone specialized mining hardware.

I personally don't hedge in a copycat blockchain because the success of any of them would mean cryptocurrency as a whole is a bad investment. 
The way I see it, it's not: 
"maybe bitcoin will be the only successful bitcoin-variant, or maybe there will be a few succcessful bitcoin-variants".
"Either bitcoin will be the only successful bitcoin-variant, or bitcoin-like-currency will see hyperinflation and all bitcoin-variants will be failures."


Fair enough, but if you want your long-term holdings in bitcoin to appreciate, it's in your interest to call out the hype about copycat blockchains to reduce the possibility that the bitcoin network fragments into an increasing number of copycat blockchains and becomes discredited as a result.

I don't think he was. I think he was explaining that regardless of where the value comes from (intrinsic or from a 'self-fulfilling prophecy'), the currency is useful to its holders because people will accept them as payment.
It was about a broader point that value cannot be divorced from people, the way it allegedly is in the mind of 'bitbugs'.
There was no mention of fiat, and indeed, gold has not only been useful through history playing the role of coin of the realm.
