People want to buy/sell goods using anonymous digital money.
And they want to store their profits in said money.
This is real demand.
Even if 100&amp; of the speculative demand left the market, BTC would still have a non-zero, "intrinsic" price from people who would continue demanding it for these uses.

Robbers can do chain analysis on a user's payments to trace back and see how much he holds.  
The Wanchain 3.0 release in December will provide a decentralized solution to this problem:  
BTC -&gt; BTC' tokens on Wanchain  -&gt; private ring signature transaction -&gt; BTC' tokens on Wanchain -&gt; BTC

There are certain products that can only be purchased with BTC or XMR.  This is where the natural demand comes from.  
And the people who sell the products need seizure-resistant assets like BTC for storing their profits -&gt; more natural demand.

When someone is demanding BTC because they need to use it, that's natural demand.  
If someone is demanding BTC just because they're trying to make a profit speculating, that's artificial demand.  
BTC has both natural demand and artificial demand.

This is also possible:  
BTC -&gt; centralized exchange -&gt; XMR -&gt; XMR -&gt; centralized exchange -&gt; BTC  
The advantage of using Wanchain is there's no risk of centralized exchange or XMR/BTC slippage.

Bitcoin isn't private, but it is anonymous.

You can only make a gold-plated wristwatch if you buy gold. This forces watchmakers to acquire gold. Forces = artificial.
"artificial demand" is a subjective term you apply to real demand that you don't like.
