I dont have Wells Fargo or BoA xP, i was thinking Coinbase but im rather annoyed that i would have to wait a week to get coins at THEIR price then
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:56:18
okay, i asked my banker and he said it could be there by later today (i went at 9 AM) but most likely tomorrow
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:48:36
is that really how it works? that sucks!, still, is there another option that is as easy as coinbase to link an account/transfer funds to? i just got fucked by bitcoin 24 so im exploring other options
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:00:51
oh okay, thanks anyway

upvote for visibility 
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:59:50
i just wanted a bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:11:00
IKR! Where is this Simon! he needs to come out and communicate with us..
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:41:00
im pretty sure it was for only a few minutes because they were just up a hour ago... but i feel a bit paranoid due to my sepa transfer still being in limbo
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:45:43
i guess thats all i can do :)
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:31:46
what i mean is that there isnt anything under transaction
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:03:35
yep yep thats what im hoping for :D
it wasnt a large amount, ~260 euros, looking to get a few coins 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:55:39
heres a suggestion, make getting the bitcoins FAST, waiting 2-3 days for a SEPA or other stuff is a pain in the ass
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:24:13
i will definently, but I REALLY doubt ill get much of an answer, im sure itll be like "oh look, its back up again"
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:55:43
Deposit not withdrawl
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:15:35
okay ill look into it, problem is im probably going to have to go in person to do the transfer
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:18:28
Hmm, well i DID send the money to his german account, so im hoping that i get access faster?
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:33:08
feels better that way
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:08:57
heres what i mean, Yesturday or the day before when i went to check Bitcoin 24 the receiver information was bitcoin24 Limited or something of that sort, now its some guys name, maybe im just being paranoid, but has this happened before?
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:38:17
thanks alot.. seems like hes got alot of work to do.. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:29:25
thanks! its seems my question has been answered though
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:11:16
The Silk road can be used to buy what ever you want drugwise, yes it works, it racks in ~1.2 mil a month in sales
there is a subreddit for them @_date: 2013-04-11 14:06:20
alright, thanks for the advice :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:54:19
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:04:01
i know.. just wondering how "safe" things are... i just hope it works out so i can get my coin
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:09:46
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:57:20
i sent one today, but im not sure if ill get a reply
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:42:10
So if i get my money into Dwolla, ill be able to get my coins from bitinstant rather quickly?
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:10:34
QUESTION: Just bought coins from coinbase last night, my transaction page has not updated with anything! is this normal for you coinbase users? it showed that i bought them and my limit went down, im just going to assume that it went through and its just lag?
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:11:48
okay thanks for that info
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:53:18
ah i see, thanks for this info
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:08:33
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:30:04
Can we figure out who that was, track them down, and rage them out? Its seriously so dumb that something like this happens because one idiot decides to call the cops for nothing
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:52:22
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:02:18
its actually not that dumb and works alot better then most people think ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:38:37
thanks alot man, this is what im thinking of doing, any idea when the prices of BTC are going to start going down? its just climbing like crazy!
