There is quite obviously a price mechanism, maybe not a yraditiobsl one.   I would appreciate helpful feedback.  Like here is why this wouldn't work and here is how to make it work.  I just want the value of the currency to be based more on the value of work and to put the mechanism for controlling that mechanism back in the hands of the masses.  For example you could have a union of workers that could force a vote on the price of a service.  I thought there were some good ideas above.  I am not trying to rewrite economic theory nor was I really talking loudly about it.  Just
 floating some ideas that address the things I don't like about bitcoin.

I fully understand the process that gave bitcoin value.  I was involved and did some mining a long time back.  Over the years of playing with it I decided it isn't really a fair system just like all the other economic systems we've built this far.  So I came up with some ideas for change.  I think what you guys seem to be misunderstanding is that what gives this currency idea value is the actual value of performing a task as opposed to mineing and changing difficulty of hashes.  I'm not entirely sure how to handle that process, but I think the algorithm I am beginning to formulate involves humans, but I would like to do things in such a way that no one human could change value or control inflation.  Those things would have to be collaboratively dealt with.  To simplify what I was trying to express above the value of the currency would be inexorably tired to the actual value of labor.  If the above doesn't make sense, how could one achieve this idea?
