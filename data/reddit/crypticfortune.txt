I agree with ar4s (if everyone thought like Peter Sunde, don't need a central government), but like Peter Sunde said, taxes and "redistribution of wealth" aren't the only reasons for government control of currency (eg. I feel like he'd at least consider anti-money laundering measures legitimate). I don't think that these are insurmountable problems, even within the bitcoin architecture (the same way businesses aren't allowed to pay their employees in cash under the table). The real trick will be if we as a society can discuss these issues officially and get the law on our side, or if bitcoin just remains "shady" (or worse, governments decide they need to crack down on bitcoin)...

For bitcoin to be a reasonable replacement to SWIFT for the vast majority of Iranians, I think you need one of two things to happen:
1. Need someone in Iran to somehow bank roll and start up a very large exchange, which could easily be targeted by authorities.
2. Iran government says "fuck it" and embraces bitcoin as an official currency. This would seem to solve a lot of their embargo problems in a big way (but could mean trouble for the rest of us (could we withstand an Israel military DoS?))...

I can't envision a situation where prioritizing higher fee transactions would *break* something...In fact by requiring that all previously received transactions get included *first*, it sounds like you leave the door open for clients to starve themselves. For example say I issue a billion 0 fee transactions and then one 500 BTC fee transaction. It's quite likely no kind soul will ever process all 1 billion of my 0 fee transactions in hopes of getting to the 500 BTC. Would that effectively DoS that address into oblivion? Presumably the only person who could that is the owner hirself, but still, it seems like a fairly easy way to shoot one's own foot? (it might not take a billion to do that practically...)

Right, that's what I'm saying. Likewise, if people are blacklisting coins, it would be "pretty dumb" to accept payment in bitcoins unless you can check all of them against the canonical blacklist. ANd if there isn't a single canonical blacklist, then well, you're kind of screwed.
My point is that the "marked bills" model and bitcoin models are different in that the bank likely wouldn't blame you for the heinous crime, and would still accept your money for that reason (they're just marked, not fake).
I suppose continuing that line of thought, rather than a "blacklist" a sort of "most wanted" list could be helpful. If you see any of these coins come through, consider retaining extra information about that transaction and alerting the authorities...

Oh noes! They're making databases!
Sorry, just find spelling errors in threatening letters funny...

I don't know how you sent your transfer, but if it was a normal international transfer (ie. "International USD wire" option), that will be crazy slow. I don't know what the speed is on the other options, but so far sending USD *out* of mtgox via Dwolla has taken me more than 24 hours (with no signs of success yet)...

But unless everyone agrees to the same black lists, funds that go through a mixing service (eg. [bitcoin laundry]( they'll be effectively anonymized. So do you say that if you pulled "tainted coins" out of a mixing service, your money's worthless? That's a harsh price to pay for somebody else's shenanigans, especially given that we currently have no defense against it.

This exactly. If the exit-entry points where BTC turns into dollars are for all practical purposes traceable (unless there's some magical appearance of cash-based brokers), but for now the online markets all end up resulting in some virtual-paper trail.

Transaction fees aren't the only way that banks make money. There's no reason banks couldn't lend bit coins for interest. In fact, if we *had* bitcoin lending institutions, we could do short-selling and maybe avoid some of the rate crashes we're currently prone to.

I remember reading some economics article pointing out that this is currently a major flaw of bitcoin. In order to short, you need someone willing to loan you a bunch of bitcoins with the guarantee that they'll be getting them back at some fixed point in time, but the bitcoin economy infrastructure just isn't there yet (no one that I know is willing to take risks like that). Hell we have a hard enough time finding a reliable escrow service. Your only hope is to find some rich "bitcoins will rule the world guy" and set up a private agreement with them (though they may not be so keen on the massive sell off you're planning).

The real problem is that [PayPal doesn't take MtGox](

Obvious errors in the headline aside, if the site they were talking about was already "shutdown" it sounds like they were doing it wrong...? If the site only existed in I2P or whatever similar service TOR has (TOR must have some mechanism for internal TOR websites, right?) and not IPv4 space, it would have been very very hard to track down...

Whaaat? Most "nodes" are miners now. That's the problem.  Adding more burden to "full" nodes makes it worse.

This is the central wager of bitcoin. If there is insufficient adoption to generate sufficient transaction fees for a decentralized miner user-base by this point, then bitcoin deserves to die. It becomes, by definition, worthless.
