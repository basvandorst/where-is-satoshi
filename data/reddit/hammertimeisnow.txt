And how do you know that the bitcoin still belongs to Mtgox and not Mark Karpeles?
Remember there is an important distinction between the assets of Mark and the assets of Mtgox. 
CEO Mark could have paid himself those Bitcoin and transferred himself the private keys.

I think the fact mtgox have taken down their site, shut down their twitter, moved to a virtual office and not released an immediate response 10 hours later speaks volumes.
Even if the stated truth isn't the whole truth or is somewhat false, the situation mtgox are in is obviously extremely bad.

"Just one day later shows that the manipulated transaction IDs are more than a sort of private problem of outdated software MtGox. Transactions throughout the Bitcoin network begin to behave strangely. They appear twice in the wallet, withdrawals will not work on other financial markets, and to make matters worse, someone sent indiscriminately Satoshi. What is happening?"
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:06:02
Isn't this because trading is volume is separated amongst more exchanges whereas before it was more concentrated at just mtgox (70%). And that picture just shows the volumes for a single exchage? Or does it show combined trading volumes across all exchanges?

Did you read my comments? I'm talking about 1000x increase.
I couldn't care less if it reaches 3k as far as this discussion is concerned. I couldn't care less if it matches some exponential pattern up until that point. The only way I will give you an explanation if Bitcoin hits $600k per coin in 24 months from now. 
It's kind of laughable you think if Bitcoin goes up to $3k that somehow proves my statement wrong. There's a world of difference between $3k and $600k.
Btw I hold &gt; 1k bitcoins so if someone benefits greatly from Bitcoin going up to $600k it's me.
Anyway I have things to do. We'll see in 2 years.

Of course. But you would tell someone there is zero chance their qt bitcoin wallet will generate them an address which is already in use by someone else. Or you might not. But it's semantics. I don't formulate my everyday speech mathematically. I guess a neater way to write it would be to prepend "effectively" to the phrase zero chance.

A 1000x increase in value would value a single bitcoin at $600,000 a piece. There is world of difference between a bitcoin being worth several thousand dollars ( eg $4k ) and a bitcoin being worth $600k.  Why on earth you think I owe you an explanation if Bitcoin reaches $3k in a year is beyond me, that's not relevant at all to what I've said.
Feel free to give me an explanation when a Bitcoin isn't worth $600k in 2 years time, I'll look forward to that.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:11:19
You are very presumptious. I base my statement on simple mathematics. 
If half the people who replied bashing me sat down and did the maths of how much money would be required to push the price that high they would realise they are making themselves look very silly. I can see what this subreddit has become now, people hoping to get rich quick and blinded by greed and stupidity. The market cap would be several trillion dollars if the price increased 1000 times. You are living in cloud la-la land if you think Bitcon market cap will be worth several trillion dollars in 2 years. I'm not saying we won't ever get there but if we do it will take decades, not two years. 
Sorry if you guys missed the boat but the times of ridiculous quick 1000 times returns on investments are gone. Good times still ahead and plenty of good gains to come in the next 2 years. If it goes up another 10 times in value in the next 2 years I will be absolutely delighted.
This isn't a bash bitcoin post. I've been holding bitcoins over a year. I just think sometimes we need to get real in this sub, I don't like the direction it's turned in the last few months since the run up past $260.

Nevertheless, **SHREM knowingly facilitated FAIELLA’s business** with the Company in order to maintain FAIELLA’s business as a lucrative source of Company revenue. SHREM knowingly allowed FAIELLA to use the Company’s services to buy Bitcoins for his Silk Road customers; personally processed FAIELLA’s orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity report with the United States Treasury Department about FAIELLA’s illicit activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the Company’s Compliance Officer; and deliberately helped FAIELLA circumvent the Company’s AML restrictions, even though it was SHREM’s job to enforce them and **even though the Company had registered with the Treasury Department as a money services business**."

Well Blackcoin is 100% proof of stake (no proof of work component in mining) and all the coins are pretty much mined. This means the millions of dollars spent on electricity mining Bitcoin would no longer be necessary if the protocol was adopted.
Blackcoin isn't premined like it's cousin MINT either and has a fast growing market cap. You can buy it at mintpal if you are interested.

1) You're forgetting though that we have had several days of people buying tens of thousands of significantly cheaper bitcoins and none of those people have had a chance to sell and realise their arbitraged profit since btc withdrawals from gox aren't possible. It doesn't matter if everyone cancels all their low gox sell orders instantly when withdrawals are enabled, the price everywhere is still going to be 100% higher than the price all those tens of thousands of bitcoins were bought at. Granted not everyone will try and take an instant profit and not everyone who sells will sell all the cheap bitcoins they bought, but there will logically be be higher than normal selling frequencies.

Rev 1 of XC has been open sourced already, which happened when XC transitioned over to Rev 2. Rev 2 will be open sourced similarly.
As for the other comment, DRK has been extremely successful whilst being closed source for most of it's life cycle.


Shitcoins is inflammatory language, I don't see the need for it. We're all adults here. Dan has reviewed other crypto coins, often privacy centric ones. This is nothing but a plus point as it shows Dan is a respected member of the community since other's value his stamp of approval. He also gets to see a wide spectrum of fledgling privacy solutions which only strengthens his knowledge.


Complete nonsense.


That developer is no longer a member of the XC team. He actually never wrote any code for XC either. It's unfortunate what happened with him but XC is in no way connected. If a Microsoft employee flies a plane into a building does that make Microsoft terrorists?


Now you are just being childish, complaining about stealing ideas. This is how the economic market place works. Competition breeds this behaviour, and the cream ends up rising to the top.

An important thing to remember: even if you don't convert your Bitcoins into fiat but simply purchase something with the Bitcoins themself that still counts as realising the gain in your investment. So if you have made a 30k profit and decide to try and get around the tax by buying a car with the coins rather than converting into GBP, you will still be liable for the capital gains tax.

- People encouraged that price went above $150 and remained stable. Lots of belief has been growing again that a spike is coming similar to the one earlier in the year
- Silk Road shut down brought lots of media attention and new interest (Streisand effect). All the usual indicators like transaction volume, wikipedia articles hits etc show spike upwards in the last couple of weeks.

Litecoin will rocket if they add it. Question is will they add it...

He also says here later he isn't actually trading on BTCChina himself but just knows people that are
I don't think he knows his ass from his elbow.

btc-e rose up to 100, it did not remain stable

I think it's pretty clear from my title and post that I am asking for banking advice from the community. It never crossed my mind people would try and tip me for asking for advice - in the highly unlikely instance someone thinks of doing so, guys please do not send me any tips. I will however tip anyone who provides useful information.
It is an exchange. I am in no rush to show what has been accomplished so far to the general public. I am not asking for investment from people here so it's not necessary.

Satoshi is speculated to have mined close to 1 million bitcoins and they have not moved.

Can you share what your lawyer said? Please message me privately if you won't want to post it publicly ;)

HMRC is only part of the equation. You also have the FCA/FSA to deal with.

And also for Litecoin -

I wasn't actually trying to imply Litecoin would over take Bitcoin. cap2002 is remarking Litecoin will be benefiting from a Bitcoin project and I simply countered that one day Litecoin could have a project or two of it's own that the Bitcoin community can benefit from.

There is more chance of BFL shipping out the remaining units quickly.

I asked for a password reset and the exchange owner knew my random password. I had to provide parts of it as proof (I couldn't remember it exactly).

Don't jump to conclusions guys. It could easily be an intentional red herring of Satoshi. For someone who took such lengths to remain private I doubt he would select a pseudonym so similar to his real name.
Plus even if it was him, should we really be up-voting this? I hope if someone out here some day really does find out Satoshi's true identity he/she doesn't rush onto Reddit to unveil him. I may be wrong but I have a feeling a lot of people in high up places don't like the pandora's box he has opened... he's elected to remain anonymous for a reason.

Good news, but what about the FSA/FCA?

Hopefully things are looking up, mtgox ceo Mark Karpeles tweeted 'Spent another week full of meetings and more meetings to improve the situation. Things are starting to come together..' a few hours ago (

Firstly that $1MM is revenue not gross profit. But also, along with that $5MM comes the contacts. I'm guessing they took VC from entities that have some connections. That's why some people go on Dragons Den (tv show to entrepreneurs use to raise funding), for the contacts the angel has.
That's my take on it.

This is just registration which is the first and easiest step.
Obtaining the money transmission licenses to lawfully transmit money for the states of america costs millions of dollars and 6-12 months.
No business even has these necessary licenses in all the states. The closest I have seen is bitinstant with licenses for 30 of the states.
