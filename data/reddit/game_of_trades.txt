Anyone who prefers hillary over trump has no fucking clue about politics and should avoid voting. Hillary would have started world war 3 by shooting down russian planes. But maybe Americans have a fetish for war I dno.

Being affiliated with a company and helping them increase their sales by promoting their product and getting a % out of the earnings you provide them with is hardly similar to a ponzi or a pyramid scheme. It's is just smart marketing. 
In ponzis &amp; pyramids you usually have to spend your own money before even being able to earn anything, and you'll have to actively find new promoters below you instead of actual customers. The focus is no longer on the product itself, and it's merely an excuse to run the scam. Ponzis and pyramids can't last forever as you'll eventually run out of money to pay off the older promoters/investors, and the whole thing comes crashing down.

You’re either stupid AF or just misinformed and trying to sound smart. 
Not nearly the same thing as a ponzi/pyramid.

And this is where you’ve just destroyed yourself buddy, because I I HAVE quit my job. 
You must honestly have a brain tumour to completely dismiss TA. Keep hodling through january crashes retard. 
You wear that mc donalds cap with pride alright?
Fucking REKT.

You damn FOOLS. How the fuck does this even get upvoted? Dismissing TA as completely useless only showcases your low IQ and ability of seeing patterns in charts. Can you win every round in poker? No, but play statistically and you’ll profit in the long term. The same happens if you learn to use TA.

Ladies and gentlemen! Again, the narrow mind of a crypto kiddie has been publicly displayed for the whole world to witness. I shall now once more overload his puny brain with my superior knowledge and life experience, which will most likely cause his head to implode on itself, landing me the final kill. 
The behaviour of this idiot points to that he has now finally realised himself as an idiot for dismissing TA as useless, and is now deflecting away from the original point of this internet arguement so that he doesnt have to deal with the embarassment that came along with this realisation. But I enjoy recking reddit kids so I shall make him cry again for my personal entertainment.
l am indeed a graphic designer. Now let me tell you something about graphic designers and creative people in general that you did not know. Creative people do not do what they do to make a living. We do it to live. We love what we do and it has been my lifelong dream to create art for a living. This year, my dream was finally achieved. I quit my industrial job as a CNC operator and went full time on my art which I do from a different workstation at home, separated from my normal computer. Hence referring to it as ”at work”. You do not stop working after you make money unless you’re a complete loser such as yourself, kid. 
You have also shown to be conciouss of your embarassment by putting words into my mouth. Not once did I claim to be a millionaire. I could be one, or I could not. How is that even relevant? It’s not. Again, a red herring strategy. 
Right now I am living my dream while you are stuck in life, desperately waiting for the next bull run to recover the gains you used to have... All because you dismissed TA and didnt sell the obvious bubble. I hate to break it to you but... You fucked up hard dude.

We need to downvote this post into oblivion.
