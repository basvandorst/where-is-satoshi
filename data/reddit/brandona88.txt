Assuming it does become the global reserve currency, at one point everyone will be in the market, and the price will stabilize. So bitcoin might give advantage to the early adopters on pension/ss, but will not help future generations since the price has stabilized.

I'm just gonna break down why not ever using the same address twice is still risky if QC become mainstream.  
  
1. Someone sends BTC to your newly created public address.  
2. The thief reads the receiving public address from the blockchain and starts cracking the private key with a QC.  
3. If your coins aren't moved to a different address before the private key is cracked your coins are gone. (Months? Days? Hours?)  
4. So unless you move your coins frequently (i.e. cold storage not really possible) you're at risk of a QC attack.

Then OP asked the wrong question. The question should not be "when" but "if".  
  
To answer the "when" question, core nodes won't accept B2X blocks; so unless B2X has enough nodes, B2X won't survive.  
  
As for what everyone else is saying, miners most likely won't be switching to B2X since they'll be mining the most profitable chain, i.e. BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:06:33
Then it'll depend on how exchanges label the coins. Most are going to wait a few days to a week and label the longer chain "BTC" with the other one being the altcoin.  
As you said, most new money aren't involved in the bitcoin community, and will just buy whatever the exchange labelled as "BTC".  
  
Opinions incoming:  
I'm rooting for core (1x) for personal reasons. 2x doesn't have core's support and I think bitcoin needs core more than empty promises on reducing transaction fees. (I'm fine with the current fees)

It'll be more like 1 block per 66mins if 85% of the hashpower leaves. There's also the problem of who's going to buy B2X on exchanges. B2X won't have much value if no one buys them, and most of this sub doesn't seem to be buying it. New money won't be buying it either for at least a few days since most exchanges are labelling B2X as an altcoin for the first few days.

Since the issue has been identified as the SD card I'd recommend the following:  
1. Reboot your phone, wait for a minute or two (sometimes it just takes a while for your phone to load your SD card)  
If that doesn't solve it, back up your SD card before doing anything else.  
2. Plug in another SD card and see if your phone reads it.  
3. If your phone reads the new SD card, copy the old SD card over.  
3.1. If your phone doesn't read the new card, it's probably a problem with your phone.  
  
Btw, if any of your applications grey out especially when you've just rebooted your phone, it's most likely still reading/can't read your SD card (my phone takes a few seconds to read mine every time I reboot my phone)

I know it doesn't expire in a year. The numbers I provided is the amount of BTC you will accumulate if the miner was running literally forever, it's called the sum of [geometric series](  
If you have a payout that decreases a by fixed percent every time it occurs, your total return will converge to a single number. 
For example, if you have an infinite series of number that starts at 1 and decreases by half for every entry, the sum of the whole series will converge to 2 (1+1/2+1/4+1/8.....~=2). Go search it up.  
All in all, I'm not convinced that you've done enough research on mining and cloud mining, the link you provided that tells you your ROI on an Antminer L3+ is 51 days, yet the website explicitly tells you it didn't take rising difficulty into account.

Haven't seen any comments here yet, wonder why you mentioned people being rude and stuff.  
  
You sounded pretty panicky from this post and your comment, so I want you to calm down first. I'll outline how to sell your BTC for USD and withdraw it, but I'll also leave my suggestions of what you should do instead.  
  
Take a few deep breaths and relax for a few seconds.  
.  
.  
.  
Now that you've calmed down, let me lay this out for you:  
  
It seems like you used coinbase to purchase your bitcoin, and want to know how you can sell those bitcoins for USD "just to be prepared". Since you used coinbase, and I'm assuming you live in the US (since you want USD) [GDAX]( is probably the best place you're looking for.  
  
You can transfer your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX **for free** since they belong to the same company. Then you can sell your BTC on GDAX, normally at a smaller spread than on Coinbase. But before you do that, make sure you read [this link]( to familiarize yourself with the withdrawal process.  
  
Once you've sold your BTC for USD on GDAX, you'll want to withdraw the USD, again, just refer to the link I linked above.  
.  
.  
.  
Now for my opinion and suggestion:  
  
Zoom out on the weekly [chart]( of BTC/USD and tell me what you see. What I see is that last candle is still green, which means the ***price right now is still higher than the price last week***, this little dip is quite normal in crypto to the point where most people don't even care about it anymore.  
  
What I advise you to do is to actually **buy the dip** instead of planning on selling your BTC.  
  
That is all.  
  
**tl;dr**  
GDAX is probably what you're looking for, **you can transfer there from Coinbase for free**, so read [this link]( to figure out how to withdraw your funds.  
But my advice to you is to **buy the dip** and **HODL** instead of planning to sell.

Most vendors already have some sort of NFC devices (for contactless credit cards). I think it's just the software that's lacking.  
  
Personally, I think the biggest problem how to put a private key on an RFID chip and still keep it secure. From what I know, current credit card chips just transmits the credit card number, the chip on the card doesn't sign anything. The vendor then just bill the credit card number with whatever amount the vendor wants. Which isn't exactly secure.  
  
With Bitcoin however, the vendor will need to first transmit the amount of BTC requested, the client will need to sign the transaction, and transmit the signed transaction back or broadcast it. The problem here is this can't be done with only an RFID chip (the chip can't sign anything, it can only transmit the same string every time it's activated, i.e. the private key). So if you do a transaction like how current contactless credit card transactions are done, you're exposing your private key. But you can of course still do everything with a phone.

Intriguing, based on current prices, you'll be able to make a trade on GDAX roughly every 5 days (assuming you wanted two $5 trades per day).  
According to [the latest moon math]( the most conservative daily growth rate is 0.48%.  
  
Say you want to stay invested for a year, according to [this formula](  
  
If you stick with coinbase, you'll end up with **$9730.99** ($9.85/day, compounded daily).  
  
As for trading on GDAX every 5 days, you will only end up with **$9683.39** ($50 every 5 days, compounded every 5 days).  
  
But since you won't be able to make $50 trades when the price reaches $5000 (hopefully soon), you'll need to make adjustments to your trade, which means you get even less chances to compound.  
tl;dr:   
Coinbase - **$9730.99**  
GDAX - **$9683.39**  
Compound interest is your friend.

I think [this]( will help you out. It looks like at the most optimal situation (always sunny and at the south most point of the UK) you'll get ~2300kWh/yr of energy. That means the maximum amount of power your miner can run at for 24/7 is ~260W (which is small IMO, a regular heater is easily 1000W). I'm not sure if greenhouses in the UK needs conventional heaters or not, but if they need heaters, replacing those heaters with miners running on the grid will definitely offset some costs.

You do realize the difficulty increases with time right? Say you spend that $315 for 0.114 BTC in June, you get to keep that 0.114 BTC forever. Since you said you're making ~$2.10/day, I'm going to assume you're mining 0.0005 BTC/day, if the difficulty stays the same, it'll take 228 days to make back your investment. If you take difficulty increase into account, say you use the difficulty increase between 2010 and now (~35x/yr), it will leave you with 0.0516 BTC. If you use the increase between 2011 and now (~7.2x/yr), it'll leave you with 0.0924 BTC. Btw, Japan's GMO is developing new ASIC chips, who knows how efficient those things will be.

That article doesn't 100% reflect what was in the Chinese article though. Not like the Chinese article has any substance, it claimed the 2013 crash was caused by the Chinese government issuing "announcement 289".  
  
Also, the article simply says guojiaowang (an exchange) ***voluntarily paused*** trading crypto because it's "cleaning up" the system. Here's the [announcement]( by guojiaowang they sourced.

Seems like it's not about Bitcoin, but a blockchain called "Anychain".  
The appstore link says it can send, receive money to other users, and a feature that lets you send random amounts of money to other people.  
The Anychain website boasts scalability and tracibility, claiming that you can link any transaction to any account (much like a finding a transaction on a blockchain) but it seems like they're emphasizing that you'll be able to actually know which client sent and has how much in his wallet (lack of privacy for ease of regulation?).

Assuming the scam is real:  
If most them used tether to long BTC, the prices should be at a premium.  
If most of them used it to short BTC, how will they buy back the BTC with tether if tether becomes worthless?  
  
Edit: Wait, I think figured something out, looks like it is possible to suppress BTC price with a large amount of tether for a short period of time, like a reverse pump and dump. The tether issuer just needs to buy back the BTC before people figure the scam out 
 and the skyrocket of BTC/tether.

Miners don't verify transactions one by one, they verify the whole block at once (all or nothing). In the case you presented, Miner A's unmined block is worth nothing, since he has not verified a single transaction.

But since Miner B's block is smaller and can be transferred quicker between nodes, Miner B's block gets copied faster and get included in the next block, rendering Miner A's mined block useless since other miners are already using Miner B's block.  
  
In both cases Miner A gets nothing.

He bought 90% of his worth well before the fork so he most likely has some BCH.

That's the beauty of compound interest, assuming all else are equal, the more times you get to compound the more you'll end up with in the end.  (say you have something that grows ~7% every week, if you do 1.01^7 , it's going to be more than just 1.07*1).  
I used the average growth rate because you're dollar-cost-averaging, the dips and bumps cancel each other out.

We were at $4700 when the Caixin article came out, I don't think a &lt;15% dip is that bad. It's even smaller than the BCH fork uncertainty.

The quote was also poorly translated from Chinese.

Coinbase doesn't though, Coinbase literally sends super high fee transactions (can be checked on the blockchain). Hate how they do that because it drives up other people's fees as well, as said, this is an "endless loop of madness".

If you spent that $315 in actual bitcoins you'll have $440 today.

Because some weak hands think Bitcoin's crashing and panic sell to stop "losing more".

Post was poking fun at people who are actually planning on selling, guess it wasn't clear enough.

Still miners, they'll still get the transaction fees.

Did she specifically ask for BTC? If she did, she should have no problem converting it? If you're trying to introduce a friend to BTC, good luck!

If they can provide the proof that they planed this months in advance (preferably more than 6 weeks since that's when the hack started). Then I'll reconsider my stance. Otherwise, this is extremely fishy to me.

Exactly, if their markets are flooded with CNY, the prices will be at a premium.

Are you sure it has a lower chance of failure? You're exposing yourself to risk every time you make a trade. IMO, hodling is the most conservative strategy (with a lower return compared to people who trade well).

I think the "he or she" was referring to the bank teller.

We need more people like you, people who are willing to learn from mistakes (either your own or others') and make sure it doesn't happen again.

Bitcoin cash is a fork that already happened, and this post doesn't talk about that subject. People are now talking about the proposed Segwit 2x hard-fork in November. This post (BTCC mining a block not signalling NYA) tells people that BTCC is pulling out from NYA, which was an agreement between some businesses and miners to support 2x.

Did you set a custom fee or did you just go with whatever was recommended? It's your own fault if you didn't set the fee yourself.

Or even more absurd, if they ban people from owning bitcoin, they'll literally be banning people from memorizing strings of words (seeds).  
I don't think they'll ever do that. IMO the best thing they can do is to embrace bitcoin and grow their economy around it since they're already going through an economic change anyway.

I guess we interpret these meme differently then. I thought this meme wasn't supposed to present an actual dilemma but two choices with one being the obvious "right choice" (buying the dip). Which then makes fun of the people who are actually having a hard time making what should be an easy decision (new comers with weak hands). Personally, I find it funnier to see people facing a "fake" dilemma.
