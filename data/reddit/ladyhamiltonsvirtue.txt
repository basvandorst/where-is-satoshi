Still not getting any support other than a form letter and less than thrilled about my btc floating about somewhere between coinbase and my wallet.

I've emailed support 4 times over the last 48 hours and have heard nothing. I'm thinking about disputing with my bank if I don't see the BTC by the end of today. This is cray cray.

Uhh... still waiting for coins that supposedly transferred last night to hit my wallet elsewhere... wtf...

How are you getting in touch with them? I've sent several emails over the past couple days and haven't heard a peep. 
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:17:48
Yeah, nada.

Same story here. Beyond frustrated. You've lost this customer, Coinbase.

Also frustrated with coinbase. Waited until the my bank debit would be finalized. Annoying, but I get it -- making sure it's a valid account, has adequate funds, etc. Made the transaction to move coins to another wallet last night. It's now TWELVE hours later and the coins have not hit my wallet, the transaction still shows as pending on their end. What is the deal, CB?!?! I had to wait almost a full WEEK for the bank transfer and now I've got another indefinite time frame until I can get the coins to where I can spend them? 
I was very excited about the CB business model, but this is ridiculous. I'd much rather pay higher fees for faster access.

Which is why they need to give us SOMETHING -- a notification on the site, an email, anything... because the silence makes me feel like I'm SOL on a few hundred bucks. NOT a happy camper.

Of course this is the week I'd pick to make a purchase with bitcoin *headdesk*
