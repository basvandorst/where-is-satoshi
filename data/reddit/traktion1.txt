You can only prove that you have the resource if you can serve it. You can allocate as much as you like, but if you can't serve it, you aren't proving anything.

There is one called Maidsafe close to release, but it uses its own currency - Safecoin - rather than Bitcoin.

I'm wondering how this straw man argment addresses any of the points I made?
@_date: 2014-04-19 08:19:18
All my questions have been answered quickly and usually with impressive detail too.
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:30:19
Sounds like Maidsafe.

The point is, nodes on hops closest to the client requests will cache the data, due to repeated requests for the data.

This is why we need the likes of Maidsafe - a new internet, fully distributed and built from the ground up to be anonymous and secure.

There is also caching at the network level. Commonly requested data is cached frequently and close to the requesting clients. Therefore, data retrieval speed is not limited to the fastest of the 4 nodes storing the data.

Maidsafe is looking in to paying open source teams through metrics such as number of downloads of a public file. It could help with this sort of problem.

XOR closeness is correct... but it is *likely* that it is geographically closer too (due to latency, bandwidth available etc).
EDIT: To explain it better, the nodes on hops closest to the clients will start to cache repeated requests.

I think you need to read about the caching mechanisms that the SAFE network will feature.
If a file is heavily requested within a geographic area, the network around those clients will begin to cache the data. This is why common DoS attacks are futile - you end up just hitting a near by cached copy the more you request it.

Safecoins &lt;&gt; MaidSafeCoins.
Safecoins = Future coin on the SAFE network.
MaidSafeCoin = Mastercoin token which will be exchanged for Safecoins (1:1) when they become available.

Sidechains? Seriously? Safecoins and the SAFE network have myriad advantages over blockchain technology. When you have instant and anonymous transactions on a highly scalable network, why would you care about being a sidechain anyway (not to mention that they don't exist and nor does the white paper for them).
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:03:44
You still have to download, then upload, the data. The storage is the cheap part of this equation, relative to the cost of the bandwidth required to do as you suggest.
Besides, even if you made this cost effective, you would be providing a caching service (edit: as a closer node to the request) which benefits the network.

Who is this 'we' you speak of? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and reasons for using Bitcoin. There is no need to gain a collective consensus.
