Either someone is printing $2 billion in tether for themselves, in which case the government might get them for some kind of security fraud (based on the whole "backed by usd" claims).
Or, rich people are buying $100 million in tether, and the government wants to know who, so they can investigate that person further to make sure its not illegal, and they aren't dodging taxes etc. 
Imo its all overblown, tether might not be squeaky clean, but I would suspect the government is more interested in who is moving hundreds of millions of dollars around. But don't trust me, I don't have the best record of being right, or id be the one moving hundreds of millions...

Quick ELI5: You aren't allowed to tell people (customers etc) if you get an order from the government and they tell you to keep it secret.  Say they think you are a money launderer they say "give us all the info on u/uacGALACTIC, but you're not allowed to tell him".
Well, they can't tell you, but they can in all honesty say on their site "we have never had a court order asking for user information", but when they _do_ get one, they can take down the notice, and we all know they have been ordered to hand over information. 
Basically they previously had a notice up, now they don't. Some government agency ordered them to hand over information, we don't know what or who is involved, as they can't legally tell anyone.

That's the lost opportunity cost. Same as not buying 10000 at $1 in 2009 or whenever, the argument doesnt hold water. 
If it dropped to $0.01 and he still hasnt sold, he's still not lost anything, you only lose or gain at the point you sell.

This is my understanding of LN, it may be incomplete, so I'm happy to make corrections if other people spot any errors.
A channel is between two parties, the payments are between them only (I'm not sure if you can have multisig on one/both side(s), but it's possible and would make sense for security for big exchanges etc. so people could arb money between them fast and cheap).  You could close one or more channels whenever you like.
One hub could have 5 (or as many as you want) channels open to different people, I believe the hub can go offline which just means any channels it has are not available for routing.  If you were connected to a hub that's offline a lot then you could close the channel as it's not worth keeping it open.
Yes, lightning can be used to hide payments, only you and the recipient should have the history, there's no public blockchain to query.
Me -&gt; 1 btc channel -&gt; you
I want to pay Alice 0.1 btc, I don't have a channel to Alice, but you do.
Me -&gt; send 0.1 btc -&gt; you -&gt; send 0.1 btc -&gt; Alice
I do this again for 0.2 btc.  If I (or you) close the channel, it looks like:
Me -0.3 btc (0.7 btc)  
You same as before (since you took 0.1 btc + 0.2 btc and forwarded it all to Alice, so your funds remain static)  
Alice +0.3 btc
Nobody else other than you, me, and Alice know the payments are being made, until the channel is closed, at which point it's written back to the blockchain.

You'd have to check to see if they orphan another block with their second one. 
If they consistently orphan another block by releasing their second block then it's possibly an attempt to game the system, if there are no otphans, then it might just be luck. 
There's also a chance that they release the block with a delay to give themselves a head start on the next one, but that's a gamble that might not pay off.

No.  
Example: I open a channel to you with 1 bitcoin in it, I send you 0.01 bitcoin a day for 50 days. One of us can then close the channel. Its broadcast back to the network saying I have 0.5 btc, and you have 0.5 btc. I'm ignoring any fees on ln obviously.

Possibly, but why just BTC? Nothing links tether to BTC, there are other tether markets. That $2 billion in tether is out of a $400 billion market cap for all crypto. 
If I want a million dollars of shitcoinX I buy a million in tether, change it for bitcoin,  and send to a shady exchange to buy shitcoinX. Someone bought my million in tether, or my order wouldn't go through.

I think there is a lot of truth to what you say. I would imaging many people are buying coins that they don't even know what it's intended purpose is (such as bitcoin for a currency, ether for smart contracts, tokens for measuring rain water in the Sahara etc...). Why? Because bitcoin is expensive, and a $0.75 ripple means they can buy a hundred, versus 0.0001 bitcoin (I haven't done the maths so I'm probably well out).
I don't hold coins that I haven't at least been to the website about, and know what its for. The hundreds of thousands of people registering over the last few days probably saw the tv reports, read a few online articles, googled "buy bitcoin", and opened an account, they don't _know_ how fees work, most probably don't have a clue what a private key is, let alone know be able to dustinguish between the good, the bad, and the scammy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:29:31
RBF is Replace By Fee.  It allows you to bump up the fee on the transaction if it's not processed.
Useful for moving coins as cheap as possible, when you don't really care if they get confirmed soon, such as moving to cold storage, doesn't matter if it takes 12 hours (or longer) to get there etc, as long as it does.
You select RBF, then if it's not confirmed in a timescale you're happy with, you bump the fee by rebroadcasting it with a higher fee, so it's hopefully picked up by a miner sooner.
To pay in bitcoin you're essentially saying "move $1000 dollars from this address to this address" but the fee is part of the transaction itself, so you pay $1020, $1000 gets deposited and the $20 is the fee.  Like tipping in a restaurant, you pay the bill of $45 by paying $50 and letting the staff keep the change, how much you "tip" is up to you, except in bitcoin if you don't tip, or don't tip enough, they don't take the payment and you're stuck at your table, RBF just allows you to take your money back, add a few more dollars, and see if they accept it now (it also gets you less frowns from the staff, and you're welcome back next time like nothing happened!).

Its only as centralised as someone spinning up a node and funding a channel can be... 
I expect ln to be far less centralised than the mining network. It'll probably be more hub and spoke than anything, but when there are thousands of well connected hubs, is it really a problem?

Because between August and mid November, bitcoin cash had a broken difficulty adjustment that allowed the miners to mine over 9000 more blocks (currently 9042 blocks ahead). 
At the current price, those 9000 blocks × 12.5 bitcoin cash a time means they printed about $400,000,000 worth of _additional coins_.
$400 million extra. Four hundred million dollars... Because they gamed the system they paid for (look up the Bitmain contingency plan, its all in there), that's what sparked bitcoin cash.
One more time, the miners awarded themselves 0.4 billion dollars for no additional work. 
Why anyone buys into a coin like this I don't know. The miners literally scammed everyone straight out of the gate. Bitcoin cash is a scam and a disgrace.

They told me this place is censored, they told me to go talk openly over there.  I did, and I do.
They downvote me, my comments are hidden.  Because I believe that Bitcoin is Bitcoin.  I believe that having 120,000 coins (&gt;$300 million) given out to miners gaming the system is _wrong_.
The sub is owned by Roger Ver, and anti-Bitcoin (mainly due to his hatred of Core) now, the moderators are his paid for staff (which is odd, Reddit should be communities run by people, not members of your staff who will do as they are told), most of the links in the menu are to his own commercial websites and services (even the links to other services are ones he's personally invested in), hell it's even styled in his websites style (they also made another sub to cross post their forum onto reddit at r/BtcForum which is managed by admin there, it's stopped recently though, hopefully for good, as well as integrating _their_ sub directly into _their_ forum).  It's nothing but an attempt to twist things to his own narrative, and influence users.  There are blatant sock puppets and shills there (they have even been caught out a few times, but still post).  This all ends up making the discussion seem rosy and good, but it's all directed by the (paid) admins, IMO this shouldn't even be allowed on Reddit as it's blatant commercialisation.
They want to talk about their coin only, they don't want to talk bitcoin, anything that doesn't fit their narrative is bad, I can only post once every 10 minutes because of the cooldown timer due to the downvotes I get there.

Yes, you're right for the MIT licence, which Bitcoin was released under. I'll update my comment!
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:14:03
Most licences will not allow you to arbitrarily change the licence to something more restrictive. So you cannot copy bitcoin and make a change to it, then make your version closed source. 
Edit: Correction, Bitcoin is released under the [MIT license]( which is more permissive, and does allow you to copy it, modify it and sell it!

Well yes, it's dominance will drop because everyone is looking for "the next bitcoin" to buy, and people are spending tens/hundreds of millions on altcoins, some of which haven't even been released yet (hello Tezos/EOS etc).
Losing daily? Not so much, it goes down some days, and up others, longer term it will trend down as long as more shitcoins are being created to make the owners rich, people still trade broken, abandoned, or appalling coins, it's just greed.  However, even at 35% (it's nearer 40% now) for _one_ coin vs _all the others_ ( look at the rise in "others", there's like 1500 of them!) it's _still pretty impressive_.

Personally I disagree with the OP as well, I hold (and mine) altcoins, and LTC isn't that bad, Doge too, probably more so than LTC, the Doge community is there, it has strong support, and it's not so cold and standoffish, it's a good introduction to mining for newbies.  BTC is IMO not for newbies, and I agree they shouldn't "try" mining, imagine your mother (as an example, but could be anyone non tech savvy, assuming your mother like mine isn't a geek genius) picking up on BTC, and thinking of "learning about mining". The horror...  
The other problem with the BTC community, is many get upset if anything other than Bitcoin is suggested as a solution, and you'll get those downvotes all day long for posting otherwise.  Apple weren't the first people to make mobile phones, but they built on other peoples work, imagine if the mobile phone users only had one brand of phone, and anything that was different from a Nokia 3310 treated as a bastard red-headed step-child nobody wants around?  We'd probably all love our new Nokia 3311 when it comes out next year, they rounded the edges more... I can't believe those Windows guys are making phones with apps that work on both PC's and phones!

Well your $9.99 Luke Skywalker action figure, cost $3 to make and ship from China, then the other $5 was spent licensing the name from 20th Century Fox (or whoever technically owns it), $1 per item is spent on marketing, $2 was overheads etc.  Basically they just hide the money in "licensing" fees (to overseas corporations in nice friendly tax havens), much like Starbucks do, until they technically make a loss and don't have to pay the government any profits.  
All those "Funglewibble Productions", and "Marvellouseish Entertainments" pre credits you see when you watch a movie, is there any reason for these?

That's the thing, with new hardware, it's still fine, I have calculated that even at current prices, my S5's are covering the electricity they use.  Plus I have solar power, so during the day it's subsidized since I'd only be pushing it back into the grid otherwise (in fact, I get paid for what I produce, and I get paid for exporting 50% of what I produce back to the grid - regardless of whether I do since there is no meter for that...).  
I'm also not concerned about the hash rate drop, sure those running S1's might be going crazy, but for every S5 you can switch off 5 S1's.  Since the drop, I seem to have more BTC coming in, too early to tell how much the difference is though.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:32:37
I'm still mining, I don't do it for the money.  The money is spent, just get used to the high electricity bills.  
The real turbulence will be when all the mining companies start shutting down.  If it drops to $100, they will all close down, diff will drop, and more will go to people like me that continue to mine, sure, it might not pay the electricity, but with people stopping mining that need to sell to pay for electricity, more coins will go into the hands of people that aren't immediately selling because the same number of coins are still being divvied up, just to fewer people.  
As long as the cost is _around_ the price of the electricity, then mining isn't a problem for many of us, it's only people that mine past that point that NEED the money from selling coins that are in trouble.  
If Cex.io at al stop mining, imagine the diff rebalance, more coins (bigger slice of the pie) for me to HODL.

@_date: 2015-01-14 12:47:37
My understanding is fine, , but "And yet another cool side-effect of long block times is that miners won't be dumping as many coins onto the market, reducing supply and creating some upward price pressure." really doesn't make a lot of sense, sure the supply will slow up, but it's not like turning off a gushing tap, the problem with the price isn't because the coins mined over the last 2 week have suddenly been released.  Bigger things are at play.  
Your point about fees is right, people looking to shift coins to exchanges to sell may start adding additional fees just so it gets confirmed in time so they can sell it in case the price goes lower.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:43:32
Exactly, some people have difficulty in realising that the more people leaving the network means you get more reward for staying in.  
If the price halves, and half the miners leave, you get twice as much in coins, but at half the value... So you get the same amount.   
The only factor for how profitable it is, is the cost for the electricity to produce your coins. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:01:15
Huh? That doesn't make sense, the supply of coins should stay roughly the same once the kinks in the system work their way through.  Supply is not determined by numbers of miners on the network after all.

But, in all fairness, coinfire does stir up a lot of trouble regarding XPY/GAW (articles aren't objective, or unbiased, I don't know if it's just to grab peoples attention as it's a pretty small and obscure news blog/site otherwise) so they do paint a pretty big target on themselves, and lets face it, a lot of BTC peeps have invested a _lot_ of time and effort causing trouble for GAW and XPY (HT being up and down like a whores knickers due to DDoS attacks is a clear sign, and I'm sure the server logs are showing up a lot more suspicious activity), so it's not all one way traffic, people in glass houses y'know...  
Hell, imagine if someone "hacked" the HT or Paybase domains and redirected them, people would love it and want to buy the "hacker" a beer with changetip, and we wouldn't be discussing the right/wrong/ethics of it. Just depends which side of the fence you're stood on.

@_date: 2015-01-14 13:56:06
That won't happen any time soon.  The more the miners leave, the better rewards for those that stay, so anyone with any new hardware is better off leaving it on.  Unless it's a real mass exodus and 90% leave all at once, the difficulty will adjust to cope, it's unlikely that that many people will switch off so soon, just companies and people sailing too close to the wind on outdated hardware or with high costs.  
I think it's fair to say that not all mining hardware will be profitable.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:58:09

Of course it is, 90% of the kit out there being turned off?  Sure over a few days a lot will be, all the old power hungry kit will be first, but the new efficient kit will still make money if you think about it (it's already paid for, so to keep running now you just need your electricity covered).  
Rewards are the same (although will fluctuate because of the hash rate drop, so may slow up), but with some miners dropping out the game, people with the latest hardware will still be able to run, as the rewards split between less people = more reward each (yesterday I made more than usual, but this could be just a freak based on fluctuations, which at the current price pays for electricity).  
People complain about whales flushing out weak hands, I think of this as flushing out the weak mining hands that are living hand to mouth.  Anyone that can mine with more efficient hardware and not sell should be good to carry on.

Way to miscronsue my argument, can you even read properly?
Implying that they have the "biggest economic incentive", so therefore their decision is right for bitcoin is wrong. 
1) they put all their eggs in this basket, if someone spent all their life savings on lotto tickets and didn't win... Would you blame them, or offer to make rules up for them to get their money (and more) back?
2) bitcoin doesn't give a shit about them, bitcoin doesn't care if its forked, this is done for security and politics, and nothing should be locked in stone as holy because some Chinese people are making millions out if it. 
Bitcoin was never designed so that half a dozen people control most of the hashing power. It was never designed so that two companies supply all the mining hardware.

There's a lot of gambling in the UK, the lotto still has a healthy number of players though. I find it incredulous that you can't do such a simple thing in the US, personally I find horse and dog racing to be a bit boring, up until the point you have money on it, then its the most important and best thing in the world. 
In fact the government has had to regulate fixed odds machines (mainly roulette) due to the massive amount of money problem gamblers lose on them. Betting on horses and football are still very, very popular, I can remember many years ago my then step dad (like many dads and nans around the country try) pulling out his coupon on a Saturday and just watching the results come in for hours (most games aren't televised).

I think this is the main thing some people don't get, miners are the ones that are paid for their services, this does not mean they should have control over the decisions made. What happens when there's another halvening? Do they decide to push it back a few years? 
Bitcoin was designed to be mined, then slowly enter a period where miners only secure the network and confirm transactions, the block reward will not be enough to rely on any more, empty blocks will be useless for miners as they will be worthless. .

Hindsight is 20/20, but I'd rather take my profit now, a bitcoin in the hand is worth 2 bch in the bush. 
At the end of the day, I've invested as much into bitcoin as I'm willing to lose, but its turned into more than I want to lose, a couple of thousand back into my bank account makes me feel comfortable, it it does all go to shit, I've got my money back already, the rest is profit.

Did either of these blocks orphan another block by another miner? I believe there was a paper written about how a greedy miner could hide blocks, and get a head start on mining the next one, if the other miners found a block the dishonest miner would then release his blocks (since it was found earlier) to orphan the other miners blocks and guarantee the reward for both for themselves.

Yep, basically the pie size remained static, but Bitmain sold slices of a pie, unfortunately it's had to be shared between too many people who were very hungry for a bite :(
Bitmain aren't the only ones behaving in such a disgraceful manner, got burned by Baikal as well.
Unfortunately I don't think it will get better as they churn out ASIC's for small market cap coins.  They make massive profits mining themselves, before recouping all their investment again by selling to joe public, and it's joe public that gets screwed by buying into the miners.  Problem is if they don't sell the miners to anyone else, they just keep all the coins themselves, and they can just keep it up indefinitely, turing on as many or few machines as necessary, and nobody wants that either.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:30:49
You know why they don't want to have too many of these crazy mining periods? Because they know it can't last. 
Having lined their pockets enough, they will allow the coin to stabilise and have normal inflation levels, generous right?
No, the only reason to do this is to stop the halvening happening much, much sooner (poss mid 2018) than planned, because them they will be left with a coin that rewards 6.25 bch and a dribble of transaction fees per block. They cannot allow this to happen before the coin gains widespread adoption. 
Bitmain are also in a bit of a shitty situation, since they hold what 10k+ coins from the extra inflation? And they can't dump this on the market to recover their costs. And it looks bad, but does it look as bad as them selling?

@_date: 2018-06-25 17:33:26
Umm, no, because the supply is pretty constant (Dash has a fast adapting diff algo), all coins have an equilibrium of coin production and price.
If you print 10 coins a day for MadeUpCoin, and they sell for $1,000 each, you need to get $10,000 in new money from the market a day just to keep the price stable.
The coin production state doesn't change drastically, only the price, if people suddenly don't value my MadeUpCoin at $1,000, and claim it's only worth $500, and nobody buys it for more than that, then you're only getting $5,000 a day between all the miners, and some may become unprofitable and switch off (but the coin production will still remain roughly static after adjusting).  But that's their problem, and for the other miners, it becomes slightly more profitable as the difficulty would drop.
ASIC's don't change anything much in themselves (unless others are using them and you aren't, in which case you're fucked).

They are related, but its a difficult relationship. You won't get large scale mining without it making financial sense. If the price was £1 per bitcoin, then people would be doing it at home still for a bit of fun, no companies interested.  As the cost of mining is more than the cost of production, it makes financial sense to mine.  
Somewhere in the middle there is a sweet spot where the financial rewards are able to cover the cost of mining, if it doesn't cover the cost, people switch off, and the hashrate drops, but the rewards for those left rises, so if you can stay in the game and make money you should.  
We don't really have enough information to predict what will happen, but, you can bet your bottom dollar if the price stays the same or even goes down after the halvening there will be a massive reduction in the hash rate.

Something like: If you sell/include GPL licenced software in your product, you're obliged to give users access to the code.  Bitmain probably both used and modified software that's under a GPL licence, which means they _should_ be providing access to the modified code.  Obviously if people have access to the modified code then they can patch/change it to squeeze out extra performance etc.  Wouldn't be like Bitmain to include a "disabled" feature in their product of course without telling anyone (which they wouldn't use nonono).

Not billions, estimated at 1.1 million, truth is nobody knows how much Satoshi had, we can only guess.
Dave and Craig start a Florida based business which apparently mined bitcoins.
Dave died (MRSA I think? He was in pretty poor shape after a motorbike accident, and checked himself out of hospital, apparently he shot himself, or had an accident, AFAICT nobody has claimed foul play, so go with suicide/accident).
Craig messed round with the business, including what appears to be forgery to remove Dave after he died and transfer everything to Craig (along side some other equally shady stuff).
Craig may also have access/copies of Dave's stuff after his death (apparently well encrypted, that was Dave's forté).
There was also some "licensing" (about $50m worth) of "IP" going on, may be related to other (failed/failing) businesses which Craig ran, IDK the details too much.
There's some other fraud involved, like a court case the ATO raised against Craig where he claimed he had 50% stake in another Florida based business, yet in this case, he claims he's nothing to do with it and they have no right to make him go to court (appears to have lost that argument, as he clearly owned 50% of the business and was a Director along with Dave), or something to that extent.
Now bitcoin is worth a lot, Ira wants his half of Dave's estate.
Craig has claimed a lot of addresses as his (apparently made up according to analysis), including one that apparently belongs to Roger Ver, and was recently signed saying that Craig is a fraud, and what appear to be some MtGox ones etc. Basically it looks fake.
The judge has ordered Craig to give him details of the "tulip trust" (Craig claims it's a blind trust he can't access till 2020), but he says he doesn't know the addresses, was unwilling to divulge any details of the setup, and attempted to squirm out of the case again.
The judge is fed up of Wright, and is making him appear in court, and wants to actually get to the bottom of the case.
There's no evidence that Craig or Dave was/is Satoshi, there's no public evidence who Satoshi is, it could be you, it could be me, he may be dead, who knows? So it boils down to:
If Craig and Dave (or either) is Satoshi, and owns 1.1 million bitcoins, Ira should get half (his argument) as part of his dead brothers estate. Either way, if they had a "mining business" together and have millions of dollars in bitcoin, he should have half that.
Expect things to get interesting once the public has access to the court records.

With the rewards dropping, the price cannot stay the same thing if the hashrate does. We will all be mining at a loss, and for those that rely on it as a business, this cannot hsppen. At some point the hashrate and price will meet, whether the hashrate halves and price remains the same, or the hashrate stays the same and the price doubles, we don't know.  
Put it this way, if it costs me £150 in electricity alone, I will not sell my mined coins for less because I don't need to. If a business is in the situation where they need to sell to cover costs, then they won't be in business long.

I don't get people that just look at the potential they missed out on, a lot seem to fixate on the missed opportunity of selling at its peak, but if everyone sold at its peak it would never have gotten so high in the first place.

We've seen what happened with ethereum. Yes two coins were created, but one won out overall, the other is another alt for "traders" to play with and milk for cash.  
The danger is if they keep the same mining algo and the miners attack it. 
On the one hand a secure coin that has one big company mining it and controlling it is a failure as far as the community is concerned. On the other a weak coin that can be screwed over by one man and one company is also a failure. Kind of a MAD situation. 
Should the two parties fail to come to a reasonable agreement that benefits both, I suspect the whole bitcoin experiment will have failed, I believe there will still be a demand for a virtual currency, so will be interesting to see which will be the new king.

To add: Basically everyone that can't use AB has no incentive to allow it, agreeing to it would be stupid as you're giving a competitor an advantage.

I think we have one shop in my city that accepts Bitcoin (CEX), when I went in and asked to pay in Bitcoin, the staff member didn't know what it was (despite having a Bitcoin ATM about 10 foot away from the tills...).  She wan't even sure they took it as payment - till I pointed to the sign that says they do.  After about 10 minutes of faffing round and getting the guy who did the training to re-read the manual, payment took seconds.
Maybe slightly faster to use a card or cash next time, but helps spreading the knowledge, I would recommend people use it if possible, just so more people are aware of it as an option.

That's another shitty argument, when he stated (basically) that "if you've been in bitcoin long enough you should vevable to afford a $20,000 server", that's pure bullshit, not only is he telling people to waste money on expensive machines we don't need, but he's asking the "old guard" to subsidise and run the network. 
There's no reason to make it so expensive, what happens to the tinkerers, and the people building startup companies, and websites? $20,000 is a lot of money, hell its an obscene amount to be spending on something that doesn't offer any returns or entertainment.

Actually, should Core agree to go with the 2mb fork and update their client, people will still use the Core client over the btc1 client, so they would retain some form of "control" over the code base (I can't see a reason to use btc1 then), people wouldn't have to migrate to the btc1 client just to remain compatible with the network, by not following they're forcing people to use the btc1 client as a hard decision.
OTOH, I disagree with the reasons for the 2mb fork in the first place.  So I totally understand why people (as I am) are against it, when a bunch of people from competing companies meet in a room to decide the future of bitcoin (as opposed to the current processes) then it concerns me, what else could they theoretically demand, expecting it to be implemented, and when do you take a stand against it?
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:53:43
Interesting, I wrote something more basic that just compared the price in bitcoin to euros, quite often it would be marginally cheaper to buy in one or the other, so you could buy for bitcoin and immediately flip to euros till the price evened out. 
Personally I'd rather pick a base currency and try to increase that by flipping, you only need a coin that trades for bitcoin and another currency. I would expect most people to buy and sell in euros, dollars, or pounds, so I think there's room to slurp up the difference in the bitcoin rate, even if its only small percentages of chump change. 
Yours sounds more complex, I'm not smart enough for that and don't have the balls for it.

Actuallly what he's saying is true, I've spent a lot of time in r/btc lately, and the decade many people that are arguing that end users should not be running full nodes. Maybe they shouldn't, but I think anyone making it a barrier for entry is doing more harm than good.

Its perfectly legitimate to mine empty blocks, for example if you're still validating the previous block. As there was a lengthy delay between this and the previous block, we can safely predict that's not the case here. 
If you were mining exactly the same as everyone else in a pool, you would be mining transactions, since by default that's what happens in the software when it build up the work to send out to be completed. Solo mining works slightly differently but you still point to a node and ask it for a work, and it _should_ give you transactions included. 
There is no reasonable reason not to include transactions, you're literally leaving money out there unclaimed, in any other company, repeatedly losing tens of thousands of dollars is unacceptable, and would be fixed.  Finding a block is like winning a lottery, except instead of claiming $60,000 you just take $50,000.
The fact that its _not_ fixed (if it were a legitimate problem), implies its not a defect, so it must be intentional, the only reason you would do that, would be if you made a saving somewhere else. Bitmain design and produce millions of dollars worth of mining equipment, to even assume they couldn't fix it if they wanted to is ridiculous. 
This can only lead to the assumption (which we cannot prove) that they are making more than the difference in lost transactions elsewhere. The likely candidate is AsicBoost leading to a saving in electric costs. 
We can simply apply Occams razor to come up with the most likely conclusion. There are other possible reasons, buy imo they fail the test.

Personally I like the way it's handled by MSE ( where they include paid links wherever possible (and has zero detriment to the user), but always include "normal" links as well, so for those that want to support the site, click the paid link, for others, don't!  Most people aren't idiots, so would click the paid link if they thought it benefited the site.
Sites need funding, it's not free to run a popular website, and produce high quality content, luckily Bitcoin can get a lot of very talented people to do work for the love of it, but still there's overheads like reliable and fast hosting, backups/whatever that you can't avoid, relying on some rich guy to do it for free isn't a good way to go.  Relying on donations usually shows it's unreliable for funding, with big injections when the site is threatened and sends out a "call to arms", followed by long periods of drought where people forget and the site runs out of funds (again).
The main issue I see with this is that some sites would probably need some form of KYC type deal, with referrals going to central accounts in FIAT, I suspect the deal with Paxful is more transparent than most affiliates.

I think maybe you're being a little harsh, remember, as you point out that Roger has been doing stuff that makes bitcoin a success, he's also making plenty of money as part of that success, and has turned the for-profit site bitcoin.com into a profitable business, which can pay people to work in the areas he feels it needs to make it more successful, eventually bitcoin.com will become _the_ place to go for bitcoin news, purchase, whatever, and (IMO) that's a bad thing.
Bitcoin.org marketing budget = How much have you donated recently?  
Bitcoin.com marketing budget = Whatever Roger wants.  
While I don't agree with a lot of what Cobra says, I think there's a point where you have to accept some form of paid advertising or whatever, and I'd prefer a vetted company, than just sticking Google AdWords on the site and/or seeing shitty ICO ads everywhere.  The current solution is less than idea, the previous solution was nice from a bitcoin perspective, where everything was impartial, but not ideal from a way to keep the site sustainable, and certainly not setup for future innovation and growth.

True, it's quite likely that he'll double down at some point if it gets that far.
OTOH, I think there's more at play behind the scenes that we don't see or know about, with Bitmain buying up companies, and Ver having his tentacles in many himself, companies like SBI falling for Faketoshi, and Calvin also spending a lot of money, it's likely (IMO) that things will get worse for a while.
One thing I noted the other day was in this comment: 


Well, it's been nearly a year and we have:
 (91,000 BCH) a mystery miner that's never spent a coin.  
 (52,000 BCH) another mystery miner that's never spent a coin.  
 (47,000 BCH) yet another mystery miner that's never spent a coin.
So I have to wonder, at what point does this stop?  Mining at a loss is not something that's covered by the whitepaper, miners are _supposed_ to be greedy, when they can take year long hits to the wallet to prop up bitcoin cash, _something_ is wrong.  They can't really spend those coins without crashing the market, they best they can hope for is other entities to take up mining, and they can stop their mining at a loss, but there has to be a market there for them to ever sell those giant bags.

Nice to see Ver taking a strong stance on it though:  (well, by strong I mean "don't get caught again").
I believe that counts as a paid shill right?  Or would you prefer Ver to be seen as so incompetent he doesn't know what's going on?
There's also the curious case where another of his paid staff (MagmaHindenburg) was caught running a campaign against the activation of SegWit:  I cuess that counts too?  Or did Ver not know about that?  I mean after BixcoinXio deleted the post on r/btc about it.

I think this is the important part, the foundation should actually make a statement to show which side of the fence they are sitting on, while I appreciate that u/mperklin may be interested in what is happening on both chains, but as a foundation board member he should definitely clear up what he considers bitcoin, and what is not bitcoin.  And this goes for all members of the board, if the decision is that they consider (as a majority) bitcoin cash as bitcoin, then the opposing members way want to reconsider their positions, likewise if they have a majority who feel that bitcoin is bitcoin, and bitcoin cash is the same status (despite the feelings of a minority of the community) as bitcoin gold/diamond/private/universal/popular/doge/cate/2x/4x/whatever.
It will do no good in the long run for the board to flip flop on this kind of subject, in fact it should be their top job to decide to allow the direction of the foundation to progress.  The last article on it was from Aug 2nd ( and if anything that article is written in too much of a bitcoin cash friendly manner ("Why is Bitcoin splitting into two chains?", when in fact we all know bitcoin didn't "split", so much as they "forked off"), certainly no similar article was written on bitcoin gold/private/2x.

In all fairness making 5 times your investment is good, while you could have a lot more, its not worth beating yourself up over.  You got a reasonable sum for little risk, buying 200 btc now is a massive risk no matter what people say. If you can't afford it, don't buy bitcoin, it is a gamble right now, the odds on losing all your money isn't that high, but if you buy now, and it dips and stays under current price for another year, can you afford that?

The guaranteed hard fork, and optional SegWit activation (which could potentially be blocked by any one of a few people) is your idea of a good deal?

I picked BIP148 because the SegWit code is already in place, not everybody updates their nodes as soon as there is an update. People are major versions behind. If we just switch it on, the impact should be minimal. 
Expecting to get code out in 6 months that could potentially screw over any non updated nodes (its really not a lot of time to dev, test, and push out a major update onto people), is the really big ask. I can't believe anyone agreed to these timelines. 
Also, I don't trust a bunch of self appointed people who decide on who to invite to a meeting.

I wish they would make smaller units, I would accept less hashpower for a lower power requirement (and less upfront cost).
These units are really only usable for industrial level mining, and I'd love to see the at-home miners have something available that's not ridiculously expensive/noisy/power hungry.  Something like the U3 in size and power requirements would be ideal.
From my POV I mined with S5's for a long time, and I still run them during the day (when I'm out as I have solar panels), so it's no problem turning them on in the morning when I go to work, it's also a "bit of fun" for a few cents worth of bitcoin.
These are 1TH for ~ 100 watts, and $150.  I'd be happy to have a couple. but $2100...  That's a bit steep.

Which is stupid, because its bitcoin
There appear to be two reasons why you'd call it that (more if you include being an arsehole or whatever but I won't go into those):
1) because its a different transaction type than current coins.  
2) because it stores signatures and transactions separately.  
The first is incorrect because Satoshi designed bitcoin to be extended, we're actually bit that far into what could be done [source](
The second is nonsense because there was never any "rule" as to what the block should or shouldn't contain, all the information necessary is still recorded, and can be verified by anyone choosing to do so.

can I point you to  your version number is inconsistent with "normal" guidelines regarding software versions and likely to cause confusion. 
At a minimum you should change the major version. Please drop the 14.3 as well, as this relates to the Core client, so a future 1.0.0 (which I believe you should do now) can start at 0 (as it should).








Your version is not a patch on 0.14.2 (I don't think you even have these changes), leaping to 1.14.3 is crazy, a major breaking change would be 1.0.0, since this is alpha/beta it should be noted ad 1.0.0-alpha. 
However, should you choose to do that, it will cause future confusion should Core update their version to 1.0.0, so I would recommend dropping Satoshi as well, this is synonymous with the Core client. 
I don't agree with what you're doing, but if you're doing it, you should do it right.

The miners accuse people of blocking 2mb which will lower prices, but they directly benefit from the high prices, and blocked the solution to change that. Some schadenfreude that. 
They don't _care_ that much that prices have gone up, at some point it will affect the price, so they gauge the support, weigh up the price, make some assumptions and increase the block size, because they still keep all the money. 
What is _wrong_ with paid for layer 2 solutions? Hell Dash have master nodes that act differently on the network to provide services, they even take some of the fees from each block. Why _should_ the miners get all the money, and not node operators or middle men who are creating additional functionality for bitcoin?

Simplified example (ignore interest etc).
I have 1 BTC, I borrow 2 BTC from you, I bet BTC will drop so I sell the 3 BTC (I plan buy it back later when the price drops, still have 3 BTC and keep the difference as profit).  
But it jumps in price instead, so in order to get your 2 BTC I owe you, the system automatically buys 2 BTC, pays you back so you don't incur any losses, and I lose however much of my BTC it cost me, potentially all of it.
Of course on the flip side, if BTC drops in price, I can buy the 2 BTC I owe you back cheap, and keep the difference.  You'll get your 2 BTC back regardless, only now it's worth less because the price dropped.
I am "borrowing" your BTC, but it's not a free (think of it as a secured loan), I have to put up something that can pay out if I lose, that's why sites offer margin trading, regardless of the outcome, the lender and the site keep their money safe, but the borrower assumes all the responsibility (keeps the profit or eats the loss).

Yes, nothing to validate is faster than something to validate, the block difficulty is still the same however.

SegWit separates the transaction into two parts, the part that is moved into the witness section frees up space in the block section. 
So SegWit will make the current 1mb block hold more transactions, at the cost of having an additional section to hold the witness data. 
Its not a block size increase, but it can add additional data to each "block", the effect is more transactions are able to fit in each "block".
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.

Hmm, I don't think it's that low, would you really expose yourself by mining the 148 chain and not "your own" chain?  
To start with people would see it's hash rate go up, which might encourage others to join it.
Secondly, it would have to be (should be) done covertly, building a longer chain to wipe out the other one, or openly 51% attacking it, so if there's "only" 10% of the total network hash, you need at least 10% to topple it, which leaves &lt;80% on the other fork.  And you're making no money doing this, so you're wasting 10% of the total hashing power to kill a fork you don't like, and that has a $ value, so the longer it takes, the more expensive it becomes (mostly comes down to luck or throwing more money at it).
An open attack, or a covert one that attributed to any one (of only a few that can organise it on a big enough scale) people, means that _nobody_ will trust that person, would _you_ trust millions of dollars in business with someone that deliberately attacked another coin, even if it's a fork, because they didn't get their way?  Reputational damage is a thing, ask any company.
If there is ever a chance of it getting near the 50% level, nobody in their right mind would mine the other fork, as it's ripe to get eaten up, the UASF fork cannot be taken over by the legacy chain, it just becomes a matter of time before it disappears.
I would say 25% is the level at which you can no longer attack the UASF fork without fear of a reorg, since you'd need to devote another 25% of the total network to attack it, at which point the UASF fork has the majority hashate.
The non SegWit signalling fork would have to build a large chain for safety, because the risk is always there till they hard fork it.

I find the "no" responses to BIP148 encouraging, it is a risky move, and these are the people that have been steering Bitcoin for years, they know the risks involved when trying to rush through crazy ideas, I too would be against it if the alternative wasn't the Bitmain proposal or slow death by no agreement.

If I want to write my own wallet, what do I need? A full node, trusting anyone else goes against what bitcoin is.

The problem I have is with ViaBTC, they can have a Chinese exchange that sells it as "the" Bitcoin.
Most exchanges don't mine, and most miners don't make hardware, for one company to have all three, they control the whole ecosystem, they don't need to persuade exchanges to call it Bitcoin if they own the exchange.
I fully expect their coin to go on the ViaBTC exchange (when released, probably being rushed through to go live ahead of August... And will feature things like "no fees", leveraged options, and other incentives to get people in).  Then pools like Antpool, ViaBTC, and Bitcoin.com will mine it, and pay their extra rewards, while guaranteeing they have somewhere to dump their coins.

Lack of usage is a separate issue, LTC doesn't have full blocks, they produce blocks every 2.5 mins as well, so capacity is less of an issue.  SegWit could be implemented by wallets and exchanges to reduce fees, this would be a big deal right now, so it's very likely it would see proper usage on Bitcoin.
The nonsense surrounding SegWit is just that, someone has put up [$1m bounty]( in a segwit address to dispel the FUD.
If SegWit is that insecure, someone would have claimed that by now.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:11:38
You're right, due to lack of implementation in wallets etc, there is likely to be little change were SegWit activated tomorrow, however it does allow people using it to save money, that alone is the reason people would start to use it. 
Right now, its not used in litecoin, I suspect because the transaction fees are low enough people are apathetic about it. 
For bitcoin, every time you see "I sent $100 and it cost me $15", you should be able to replace this with "I sent $100 and it cost me $4" which is a little easier to stomach. This is assuming the current fee structure doesn't change. 
I don't doubt a hard fork to 2mb would bring down fees, but to what? Nobody really knows. And how long would it take for all the miners, exchanges, nodes to update to that hard fork? 6 months is still quite optimistic for that even. FrankenSegWit has a date for end of July, then another 6 months to hard fork.

Core is indeed not bitcoin, but bitcoin as we know it was written by Core, core isn't the dozen or so people on a list, its a huge unpaid community which includes the people on that list, and many others including the original developer Satoshi.

Bitcoin is run (used) by a mostly apathetic lot. They run core, or whatever wallet their mobile supports. 
I totally agree that bitcoin is controlled by no one, and that includes certain Chinese miners and their cohorts, who have been blocking any reasonable changes for a long time to push their own agenda. 
Upgrades like SegWit are being blocked because a few people have such a stranglehold over the hashrate they can get a change, this is why we are in the stalemate we are in. 
If BU succeeds, we have the biggest mining manufacturer, with a stranglehold over mining, running the biggest pool, influence over pools (if your their only option for hardware, there is no plan b to switch suppliers), soon with their own exchange, and you think its wise to let them control the bitcoin software too?

Actually, to be a party pooper, those numbers are only applicable if you can match the current difficulty. 
Sat they took 25% of the total hash power, they would expect to mine one block every 40 mins. 
One sneaky aspect of this is that they will be mining the main chain up to BIP148 split, so adding to the difficulty there. Then leaving it so blocks come slower. 
I don't think you need to worry about spending money on Aug 1st, finding a block will be hard enough!

That block [471045]( was 1000kB, they literally couldn't fit anything else in!  [470858]( was 999.97kB too.
I think you mean [470678]( what was mined 6 seconds after the previous block, so only 99k as you said, but that's to be expected as it reconciled the transactions and built a new block (only 70 transactions).

I would argue that it severely tilts it in favour of the fact that mining is becoming more and more centralised. With only a few really sizable pools, most of whom are located in China, we can assume most are using bitmain miners, you'd have to be naive to believe they all operate without any kind of "deal", at the least you don't piss in your own pool, so going against bitmain could be disastrous to future dealings with them. 
The fact that we're seeing more empty blocks from certain pools is another red flag imo. 
I honestly believe this is an attempt to cause bip148 to stall, with such high difficulty, no AsicBoost benefits, finding blocks will be slow, the other chain though gets accelerated as whatever hash rate left the network and build a long chain faster. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:25:22
I'm not sure if I'm on any more or on with some of these replies. 
Amusingly the invite only mining cartel have agreed to SegWit, but they then proceed to cludge it into their own code base, rather than just switch it on with core. 
The real issue is stalling scaling, the pressure on fees means a lot more money for miners, and badmouthing the core development team. This allows them to wrest control of bitcoin away from the core devs (unpaid contributors) and hand it over to the very few people that run the mining pools, asic manufacturers, and soon to be exchange owners.

Either or, the Devs have a roadmap, if it doesn't fit in with the miners plans, what right do they have to block it?  Devs are not paid for their work on Bitcoin, miners are, they profit handsomely from mining, not the developers.  It should not be in the miners interests to stop Bitcoin growing, but instead they do, because for now it makes more money.

The joke is they have lowered the barrier to SegWit activation, but no guarantees to actually activating it. I suspect it's all smoke and mirrors to get enough people to agree to the hard fork, then let SegWit die out in November. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:57:33
Totally agree, a scaling solution is in place, its been blocked by miners who want their own solution. I have yet to see any reasonable arguments as to why SegWit has not been activated yet. 
I don't object to bigger blocks per se, I just don't want to see the progress of bitcoin stifled just so miners can keep their gravy train running a little longer.

That's bullshit, SegWit has more support than any other option by a country mile. More companies supporting it than BU, bip148 and every other fork combined.  The only thing lacking is the support of certain large miners. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:44:56
_Everything_ needs to be reviewed, and no it's not limited to changing a few numbers and the block height, I was talking about the SegWit integration and changes around that area which could have massive impact, they implemented something that wouldn't work with the current implementation initially (meaning if you were running btc1 who knows what the hell would happen).  We're talking a multi billion dollar global currency, people should _absolutely not_ be making rushed changes.
 is the link, changes every day for the last week, including things like [this PR]( by James Hilliard are not _"if X number of blocks signal over Y period of time, then change this one blocksize variable over here"_ changes.  These changes alone should be soaking in on the test net, to build on top of _so many changes_ in such short order is, well, ridiculous.  I work in the software development world, and I would not be happy with things the way they stand if they happened in our workplace.

@_date: 2017-06-08 07:15:32
Why bitcoin when there are other options which won't charge you a fortune for sending a small amount of money. Right now, the smart ones are trading it up and taking it offline in other coins, why should they use bitcoin when the alternatives are so much more appealing?
We need scaling, and we needed it yesterday, last week, a month ago... Not tomorrow, not in 6 months. 
Fuck the mining cartel and their bullshit politics, if people were able to send for reasonable fees, bitcoin would explode in growth.

If 20% move to the uasf chain, the attacker will have to match at least that to attack it, it should be very obvious at that point who is attacking the uasf. As the total of the two will be significantly less as the attacker builds a longer chain than the uasf chain. 
If mining pools start attacking each other, it'll be pretty obvious who the bad actor is. You would hope this would sway users in the other direction. If "the miners" (DCG cartel) attack the uasf chain, they will command no respect from the innocent bystanders. Faith in them to continue to be the backbone of bitcoin is lost. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:14:33

I don't know where to start with that, but some libertarians believe nobody should own anything. There are many flavours of it, some might agree with Ver as a benevolent dictatir, while others might object to this centralisation of power. _Most_ bitcoiners detest the "altcoins" that have central developers (usually with large financial interests).
Bitcoin hasn't really been a free market either, it was always guided by Satoshi, up to the point he handed over control and disappeared. After that, its been written by developers and changed by consensus. 
Bitcoin is free to use, and people buy and sell it, operating like a free market, so yes, I see where you get that from. But bitcoin development is different, they are unpaid volunteers who work for their love of bitcoin, or because bitcoin is important or central to their business. They work for the protocol. 
That's happening with btc1 is schadenfreude, this public smear campaigns on r/btc, the shilling, the paid Twitter (birds.bitcoin.com) campaign. Exactly the type of people that shouldn't be handed the protocol. 
To quote the term "you don't put the fix in charge of the chicken coop", from the merge comments in btc1 there's a lot of support for gung ho changes. Good luck keeping market cap with that attitude, let alone $2500 values for one coin.

Last I checked I uploaded something like 150gb from my node in a week. Memory I don't care about, but with big blocks being shuttled round art the time bandwidth will be a problem. Imagine a 32mb block to download every 10 mins (often less), Then share with all the other nodes you're connected to.

Hey guys, I'm starting a BIP148 ICO, can you send me money, I promise to mine the chain I believe in and not run off with your money. (Not suggesting Via will run, just pretending I won't)
Why the he'll do they need more money though? They already have substantial hashing power.

Do you really think that SegWit will be locked in by august 1st? The agreement was to implement it and turn it on with a certain %age of hash power, it can still be blocked. The agreement for the 2mb HF is time locked though. 
Once again its smoke and mirrors to get their own way. The SegWit part is just the carrot dangling in front of the donkey.

They also profit from it, the miners have an economic incentive and no bullshitting around it. 
If users of bitcoin are pushing for changes for their benefit its all great, nobody is changing the mining protocol, so miners can still mine ( and be handsomely rewarded for it). When miners want changes, is it necessarily for the users benefit? Or theirs?  The only way I would agree to the miners changes are if its in the benefit of the users as well (and I'm not talking about holding users hostage over fees etc, because that is a massive red flag).

SegWit was never merged into BU, since there are so many changes going into "btc1" would you run it? Daily changes... Try rolling those out to all your mining farms in remote areas without any problems. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:56:03
Its an attempt to force the consensus of the 86% supporting SegWit. (According to 
The majority of BU nodes are run by the big miners. 
It all depends who you thing is responsible, the big miners, or the people running nodes, buying and spending bitcoin, trading on exchanges, whatever. 
You can see that "EC" (broad category that includes, but is not limited to BU) has the same level of "support" as BIP148 on the above link. So who is attacking the network?
One last point is there are more _against_ "EC" than SegWit _or_ BIP148. That is the most telling fact. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:10:16
Its likely they can't or won't to avoid upsetting their sole or main supplier. 
As to using pools like bitcoin.com, they effectively bribe the home miner markets paying their 20% bonus. 
Still, there's me on slush, chipping away. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:08:52
Who is, or how are you getting that amount of hashing power? If 10% of the network started a new chain, to kill it you'd have to take Antpool or similar sized mining operation in order to do that in any reasonable time, even mining empty blocks. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:49:16
Its not "on" in the first place! What are you smoking?
You have to actually turn it on, running core and say [insert mining pool software]does not signal for SegWit, but you _can_ handle the blocks. 
Mining SegWit _transactions_ is another matter. Not sure is anyone actually has that functionality yet.

The fact that it's the core developers that are reviewing their (btc1) code, and pointing out deficiencies, or suggesting improvements, implies that they're the more mature team.
You can't go and modify code that's been written by hundreds of unpaid volunteers over years, merge in _someone elses_ changes, and claim to be a f*cking hero.  You also look like an ass clown for suggesting people that volunteered their own time to work on a huge open source project should be fired, not like there aren't reviews, rejections, changes that don't see the light of day etc... There's a roadmap for bitcoin, and you get on board, or go do your own thing, nobody is stopping you.
If Jeff wrote an implementation of SegWit that was compatible with the current one, but say, did it in a different way, I'd give him some kudos.  Simply merging in someone elses code, from an earlier branch of that persons code, who's the hero?
Good luck with the rest of the btc1 roadmap too, that hastily thrown together presentation, listing all that cool stuff it'll feature, who is going to be doing _that_ work?

Can't find that block, did you mean something else?
Yeah I get that they can be empty if there is another block just made, but Antpool had a 300kB block (471128) 2 minutes after a BTC.TOP block, and another (471105) 3 mins after a Bixin block, then they mined a 998 block (471103) 1 minute after BTC.TOP.  Odd, for the biggest pool out there, very odd.  The empty BTC.com block was 2 minutes after the ViaBTC block.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:07:39
Yes, I'm surprised that wasn't mentioned. If someone attacks the other chain, they will need to devote a not insignificant amount of hashing power to do so (since they still need to build a long chain).
Lets say the bip148 chain has 25% hash power, the legacy chain needs to invest 1/3 of its own hashing power in order to attack it. This leaves their own chain weak, a bad actor with enough power on their side of the chain could cause some mischief. They need to keep their own chain going longer as well, since it faces being dropped in favour of the now longer bip148 chain. 
Gonna be messy if it gets to this. Grab your popcorn. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:27:00
Well, there's still something like 60% of blocks mined by core nodes, if they signal SegWit then its activated, they can choose not to mine the blocks, but they lose out on potential money, because the core blocks are likely to do so. They can't reject those blocks or the 40% would fork off the network.

Lol. Only because the other core devs are reviewing it and offering advice. If they didn't you're welcome to the shit that would get shipped. 
Changes like this need as many eyes on it as possible, sure Jeff maybe a good coder, but anyone in software dev knows you're the _worst_ person to find problems in your code.

If you're running core you're ready for SegWit.

@_date: 2017-06-06 05:32:54
Are you being deliberately obtuse or are you clearly not understanding things?
40% of blocks are mined by "EC" clients (such as bitcoin unlimited which never merged the SegWit code into their repo), the rest are pretty much Core (so near 60%), if they are running Core, then they will (unless they run an old version) have support for SegWit. 
This doesn't mean they will be _mining_ SegWit transactions though. 
Signalling in your block header is by the by.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:15:26
95% assumes everyone is happy, why wouldn't they be happy with to roadmap laid out by Core?  Instead, as you said, it gives them a bargaining chip to block upgrades as they see fit.
Hopefully when this current issue is resolved, Core won't be so complacent as to expect miners to willingly follow their lead.

Well, you don't know what they're mining, so it could.  Since they have to pay you in bitcoin, then need to get it from somewhere... So it does in a roundabout way, at a minimum it creates a demand for bitcoin to pay people that sell hashing power.

Yes its risky, its risky it won't succeed, and that will prove that bitcoin is no longer controlled by the people that use it. It will prove that bitcoin is controlled by an invite only cartel of companies. 
Pools like Slush that allow users to vote with their hashing power should be applauded, if pools like that don't have 80% support for BU, the "DCG" seems to feel it can hit 80%, then it controls a ridiculous amount of hash power, and can do as they please, this "follow us or fail because you don't have the hash power to match us" threat is not in the spirit of bitcoin and decentralisation. 
Bitmain will soon own the ecosystem, they already dominate the mining rig manufacturing, the top pools, and will soon have an exchange (nominally owned by ViaBTC). 
Core on the other hand are working on developing the protocols, enabling the future payment processing through second layer solutions, don't benefit financially like Bitmain, and they are painted as the bad guys. They had a solution, that 86% of the network supported, and it was blocked by the people above developing their own interests. 
Bitcoin Unlimited? They can merge in someone else's code, change a few numbers, and they're fucking heroes.

Actually it does matter, if I mine a block and broadcast it to the network, and a large chunk of the network rejects it, then you come along and mine another block that's accepted, my work is wasted. Nodes do matter, as they decide whether a block is valid and propagate it across the network.

It also appears to be saying that non mining nodes should be given a grace period and follow the miners;


Sounds like that would kill UASF style forks, in fact wallet nodes as they put it have no say whatsoever, they simply have to follow 55% (!!) of mining nodes or let kicked off the network. 
Anyway its bullshit to can them "wallet" nodes, whose to sat which is which? I may not be making millions, in fact I may just get one block a month, or one block every 6 months, or maybe I never mine on it, but what's different from my node to any other? 
Its dangerous to have second class citizens. Especially when (probably) at least 55% of the first.class citizens could be oressured because they are in one country, and or use one manufacturer.

I think he means without Shitmain there would already be consensus, everyone else seems happy with SegWit. _They_ are the ones blocking it, and to double down they are forking bitcoin and premining as many blocks as they can. Why? Who knows? If its a HF there is no need to do that.
