You're right, I guess this is just wishful thinking but I'm imagining YouTube automatically assigning a new wallet address to a username and then allowing users to load up their wallet like ChangeTip or something like that.

Here's the original post where he introduced the site. 
It looks like Gox accounts had to be verified and Bitcoinbuilder accounts had to be verified and that process took &lt;24 hours. I could be very wrong though, check it out.

Bitcoin also made the front page of the Express, a free commuter paper distributed to metro riders by the Washington Post. It's given out in all of the stations and it's available in newspaper boxes around D.C. too. 
Very sensationalist but here it is:  
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:33:13
It looks like they listened! They just tweeted out that they have updated the page.

Here's the post where he introduced it, maybe you can find something there.

Legally, does the company own the Bitcoin that was mined?

How do subscription services work with Bitcoin? Does the subscriber have to initiate the payment every pay period? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:26:15
In short it means that, on a single exchange, Bitcoin can't rise above a certain price unless the sell orders for lower prices have been filled. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:38:23
Thanks for clarifying, very helpful
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:13:27
I've never heard of it and want optimal security. Will you please give me the site info? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:24:31
Will you please explain something for me? Why are Neo &amp; Bee shares purchased through Havelock Investments? Many stories I'm reading talk about LMB Holdings but how does everything fit together? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:48:20
I appreciate your time but I just got the above information from an email from Neo &amp; Bee through Havelock Investments. I do own stock but just wanted to pass along the update to the community. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:28:30
Hi dtuur, can you please help me understand how the shares work? I understand that people can purchase shares in Bitcoin through Havelock Investments but how does LMB Holdings factor into everything? Are there multiple companies offering shares? Thank you for your time and the rundown of the event. It all sounds like very exciting news! 
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:16:05
Awesome! This is how it will start! 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:17:44
Okay, maybe there were different levels. My mistake.

Just curious, do you prefer the line-o setting to the candlestick view? 
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:52:47
I may get down voted for this but I agree with you. Bitcoin security needs to become easier. There also needs to be a better hardware wallet and more publicity of debit-like cards such as coin kite.

When you first enabled 2FA, you were presented with a QR code that enabled you to sync your authenticator app with your phone. You're going to need to copy this code so you can use it on your new phone after you have moved. A secure way to do this is by taking a clear, digital photo of the QR code and printing out that photo with a printer that doesn't connect to the internet. Then, if you lose your phone or the texts don't send, you can sync it with a new device.

Interestingly, the GABI landing page has a phishing alert notifying folks about the email. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:01:52
Okay, thanks for the confirmation. Any idea where they got your information from? The username in the email is different from my Reddit one. Maybe twitter? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:22:06
Don't feel bad, you learned a valuable lesson from your mistake. Better to learn it with .4 Bitcoin that with your 401K or your kids savings. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:19:14
What about Coinjar? That's still up too though. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:09:24
How about how easy it will be for immigrants and everyone around the world to send money back to their families and to others with a minimal (if anything) transaction fee and the implications this will have on currency transmittal companies? 
Maybe tracking patterns of adoption over time?
Last idea would be how aid organizations and educational programs will use Bitcoin to accept donations and give people access to them. 
Just a few, hope this helps! 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:41:55
Yeah you're right. Because Coinbase isn't exactly an exchange, it's tough. I use the Bitcoin Ticker app for alerts and just set it to Bitstamp because Coinbase is basically the Bitstamp rate with a slight premium. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:32:34
As you know, Bitcoin has been extremely volatile today. After the Senate hearing and media coverage lots of people bought into Bitcoin. Coinbase basically filled all of their orders and is replenishing their coins to sell. By checking that box, you're agreeing to pay the Friday morning market price of Bitcoin. Very risky. Probably better to check back every few hours and see if they're back up before then. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:44:29
In Electrum, why are there multiple addresses given to me? Does each address link to my wallet? Is it safe to use these or should I generate my own? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:06:45
Thank you for this, commenting so I can come back later. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:35:22
Nope. I verified with Coinbase and haven't had any issues at all. I gave them my ID and password. Huge leap of faith and I wouldn't have done it with a number of other exchanges but Coinbase is very reputable and has been visible on this subreddit and in email support correspondences too. 
I have withdrawn/paid for Bitcoins using Bank of America and Wells Fargo without problems. 
EDIT: spelling 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:25:41
No problem. 
Take it with a grain of salt but one more reason I prefer Coinbase over other wallet services or exchanges is because they only ask for the last 4 digits of my social security number during the (optional) ID verification process for increased buying amounts. Other services ask for my whole number and I just can't make myself do that. Personal choice though. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:13:24
You have a few options. Coinbase isn't super secure for the main reason that it's an online wallet. Your Bitcoins are no more than numbers on a screen with them until you transfer them out. If you trust Coinbase, stick with them. If not, you can transfer them to a paper wallet directly from Coinbase (there's an easy way to do this) or you can stick with Electrum or go offline and make a paper wallet on your own from bitaddress.org. 
EDIT: spelling 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:40:09
Yes, you're right
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:09:10
They're selling coins now. The message earlier this week was just a temporary freeze. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:13:35
So what does that mean for the future of Bitcoin and mobile purchases? Will people have to move away from Apple products? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:45:17
If you have a smartphone, all I can offer is trying both the Authy app and the Google Authenticator app. Sometimes when I have problems with one, the other will work. Authy has been having problems recently and Coinbase suggested sending them (Authy) an email directly. 
If you're using the text message 2FA, try adding the phone number to your contact list so it isn't dismissed as spam. That's all I've got, hope it helps! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:44:19
This. Also, on the site there's an option to exclude the mt gox price which is often higher and can skew the average.

What percent of penetration of potential demand is Bitcoin at right now? Also, where did this chart come from? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:50:18
Did you get the paper wallets laminated? Pretty cool idea. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:21:57
Yea, after your initial purchase processes within a week, you can make additional purchases. After the first, you can purchase up to your limit every day. They won't appear immediately unless you've qualified for instant purchases but you can buy and buy and they'll all be staggered depending on when you bought them. Hope this helps!

I think there are a lot of reasons Satoshi (or a group who called themselves Satoshi) chose to remain anonymous. One of the main reasons must have been so the focus stays on the currency though. If Satoshi had chosen to take credit for his creation, he would have been criticized and his personal achievements and qualifications would have been tied to the legitimacy of Bitcoin. His personal life would have been nonexistent like any other major celebrity and the currency would be under much unnecessary scrutiny. By hiding in the shadows, Satoshi has given his gift directly to the people for the people.

If you search in this subreddit, Dave from walletrecoveryservices has been successful at cracking some wallets as long as you have a good idea of what the password could be.

There's a new service called itBit you should check out. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:32:05
That's right. In Coinbase, go to Account Settings and down under phone numbers, if you click Google Authenticator, it will display a QR code you can scan from the app. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:39:56
Another option you have is buying mining equipment on eBay from a seller that has the miner in hand. If the equipment works, it could save you many many months of waiting. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:59:53
Yes, please! That would be fantastic. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:35:33
Great gift idea! I keep seeing these paper wallets all over r/bitcoin. Did you buy the special paper somewhere and print the QR codes? How about the holograms? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:56:22
Could this be because of the Bitcoin Black Friday merchants cashing out? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:22:01
Of course, happy to help! I just think it's fascinating to think about and the research being done right now is very exciting. With 0% transaction fees, I think donating a few dollars to a charity, relief fund or something like that becomes much more attractive in an arena that used to have a lot of red tape. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:41:00
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:10:38
It's got to be a combination of Black Friday merchants cashing out and nervous new buyers panic selling. I'm just holding fast and waiting it out. Maybe I'll buy some cheap coins this evening.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:49:07
Seconded. Move this offline and into your own wallet ASAP. At the very least, I hope you have 2FA enabled but even that isn't totally secure.

One app that I use to keep track of prices is btcReport and I like it a lot. It has a selection of all the top global exchanges and Coinbase is one of the options too. I use it as an iOS app, unsure if it's available on Android.

Get real. 
This is ridiculous. 
"You have to have the $100 bill be worth $95 a year later in order to have a -5% interest rate. The idea is to arrange things so let’s say $100 in the bank equals $100 in paper currency now, but in a year, $95 in the bank is equal to $100 in paper currency. You have an exchange rate between them."
