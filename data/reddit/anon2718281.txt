yes, but it is going too fast in my opinion...
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:49:31
GO SCAM SOMEBODY ELSE OP!
Please Reddit stop this bullshit!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:29:05
I think it is true, check out Weibo:
search for 比特币 (bitcoin) + 中国电信 (china telecom)
this also explain the current ath in btcchina
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:19:01
exactly, someone should tag this thread as [misleading title]
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:51:04
how? well, by using it! people is not buying tons of bitcoins to buy gift cards, nor drugs, they are buying because is going up and they expect to multiply their investment.
I don't like to say this but at this point the market is making Bitcoin looks like some kind of pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:25:14
Who? the same people who made you panic buy: speculators.
They don't care if Bitcoin is the next global currency, they don't care if the price goes up or down, they only care about making money from predictable market volatility.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:48:44
hah sure you are an expert cryptographer!
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:40:40
I know that you are joking, but owning a lot of bitcoins don't have anything to do with 51% attacks
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:48:36


so in china you can not buy goods with gold? that's weird!
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:40:48
I had the same question 30 days ago OP! let's see if we can go back to the old good $150 times...
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:50:05
I dont know you, but I always connected using HTTPS, changing the DNS records wouldnt be enough 
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:57:15
It's really amazing how fast China is adopting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:58:27
Maybe good news for wild speculators, but Bitcoin is a **cryptocurrency**, not a "virtual commodity".
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:45:27
This is 5 days old, I think it was already posted...
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:58:14
Same stuff happens with any other currency, including the US dollar.
The reason here is: there is no real price for bitcoin, but what the market says, and since there are many markets/exchanges you will see many different prices.
Some people takes advantage of this, it's called "arbitraging" 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:56:19
OP you are ridiculous
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:26:51
The title is misleading: Barnanke just quoted somebody else saying that in 1995 :P
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:16:49
Who needs Newegg? they are awful!
Support original bitcoin sellers:
their stock is outstanding and they have a great customer service
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:39:28
fixed, thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:11:07
I wouldn't say it stopped the crash, but surely it slow it down...
Is it manipulation? we would never know since they can say it was some engineering problem :-/

l2ps: 
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:27:40
artificially like algorithmic trading?
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:40:03
What are you talking about OP, this is not good news!! bitcoin should be used as a currency!
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:16:05
They don't call it "Return to 'Normal'" for nothing...
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:00:07
DNS wasn't created to be "secure", if CA trust in a insecure protocol is their fault.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:27:49
Can we stop with the "good news" thing please?!
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:26:11
inb4 "you are trying to influence people with this thread"
I'm specifically talking about things that are related with your market position.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:41:34
How can this be any good? seriously, now people in China is not allowed to use Bitcoin as a currency!
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:21:33
yeah well if bitcoin is doing so well in china then tell me why they are selling everything right now... please don't give me more "good news" for today. thx.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:32:49
yup, Jackie Chan endorse Bitcoin, lol amazing
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:47:22
This is very stupid comment, try to create your own implementation of OTR and let's see how well you do it...
Cryptography is extremely complex, it takes many many years to create something quasi-reliable. Even bitcoind had (and probably still have) issues with crypto.
If you wanna see improvements in any project you should support it, being an asshole doesn't help.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:38:42
Right now the market is extremely volatile, so it's almost like gambling...
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:54:27
Well, you still need cash for buying Bitcoin anonymously...
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:52:26
THANKS thomas533! I was being downvoted for telling the truth:
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:51:02
Every "bad news" are downvoted, every "good news" even when it's an hoax it's upvote...
can we start a new bitcoin subreddit please???
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:10:38
I don't know why people is downvoting you... oh wait I actually know why: this subreddit is run by people who just care about Bitcoin because they want to get rich fast, and the downvote everything that could seems bearish and upvote everything that is bullish, even when the sources aren't clear.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:56:58
that's why i use Certificate Patrol :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:06:16
I came to post the same...
