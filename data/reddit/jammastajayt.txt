Just like Cryptsy wont be in a few months?
Banks fail all the time, Bought out or fail, Its nothing new.  
Why is it different if it has to do with BTC?

I bought my first coins at 2.25 ea.... I sort of forgot about them until the first time they hit 200 and I sold immediately.  Bought another 3 when they went down to $40ish ea to play around again and sold at $211 ea thinking that would be near the bubble again, boy was I wrong =/  STill made a decent profit, so I cant really complain.
Now I only have .31 BTC from spending 50 bucks and a bunch of those earn BTC sites.

You are an amazing person, If I could grow up to make a difference like you have I would consider myself an incredibly successful individual.

I remember that. Man everyone was freaking out. That was at the first bubble. So cool. Honestly,  so much respect.

I figured it was in real life?  Not on like a forum or something.

The only thing that is *strange* to me is using fake names.   Care to clarify a little more?

Im over at my parents back from college in Punta Gorda.  I was planning on going to Miami for New Years!  Hopefully I can convince my group to go out to dinner for that night!  Would be really excited for that to happen.

was TIMES person of the year in 2006!! You should take his opinion seriously, whether he is right or wrong.... One year after the internet became no more apparent than a fax machine is pretty incredible to me.
