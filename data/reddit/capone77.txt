Imh and very green opinion, the first design is hands down the best. Options 2 and 3 are very generic looking and fall way short from distinguishing themselves from the multitude of crap coins out there  trying to pass themselves off as legitimate long term players.

Lmao. Exactly what I was thinking!

As far as I’m concerned one Bitcoin is the same as another. Personally I want to hold something rare...not stare at some code and get all tingly. But the evolution of currency is a strange thing. Down the road...who knows ��

So I guess the question is whether or not someone would be willing to pay a premium for the higher degree of privacy. Numismatics and collectibility go hand in hand. Maybe freshly minted Bitcoins with no traceability and history could be likened to a $1 Proof Coin. That coin retains its brilliance and rarity as long as it’s never circulated, and as such becomes more collectible and rare as time passes, which leads to the coin being worth more. In 20 years you can take it to the Piggly Wiggly buy a can of pop. Take it to a coin collector and maybe you can sell that $1 coin for $20. Would someone pay an Extra few grand down the road for an uncirculated Bitcoin? ��

It was a Henna tattoo and she changes the address every 2 weeks ��. 
I mean, what strip club?

Lol. You need to get Your facts right!  First it was $50 worth, not $8. Second, he stated it was at LEAST a year ago, which in my experience, usually means longer than a year ago. So random Date....May 2nd, 2016 the price was around $444. Go back to march 1 and it was around $372. Story is 100% possible :)

Ok, 2 things gotta be said. First the obvious... do you think if you hold Bitcoin long enough they’ll replicate to give you another 25%?
Second, since when did we start putting the commas at the top for number breaks!?
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:25:19
You know, after rereading it I realize where he was coming from now selling 1/4 of the remainder each time,
But I still stand by my comma comment. Lol

There is a bitcoin ATM in the coffee shop right across the street from me and I tell you, I got a rude education when I used the bloody thing! (I live in Canada). 
I've only dabbled w/ bitcoin through faucets, painfully collecting small amounts of Satoshi, which over time actually amounted to a withdrawable sum.  Not really paying attention the amount the ATM bought BTC or paying attention to the network fee I withdrew $20. I was just excited to be cashing in on bitcoin a tiny little bit!  Needless to say that $20 withdrawal, in essence, amounted to something like $33 in the end. 
The current price of bitcoin was $10300 Canadian. The machine bought at $9340 and would sell at $11309. The network fee was 10740 Satoshi.  Wound up being an expensive $20!  Not sure ill use a BTC ATM again.

Used an ATM a few times before Christmas, before the climb to 20K. No type of ID requirements were needed. Used the same ATM a few weeks ago and had to input my Cel# to get a verification text to initiate the transaction and once again an hour later to complete the transaction. Not so anonymous anymore...

Pretty sure I accidentally gave my Bitcoin to a panhandler asking for spare change

Had to check my figures and my apologies. The 166% gain was during a 12 month span up to Aug 2017...not after.  Up over 600% dating back 2-3 years.  Good catch...unintentional error on my part ��. Have to give you an upvote on this one!
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:46:50
They exist. Nvidia (NVDA) up 166%, WeightWatchersInternational (WTW) up 331%, Shopify (SHOP) up 146%...up over 500% since it’s initial IPO over 2 years. But, comparing BTC’s potential for future growth to the potential of these 3 stocks, hands down Its Bitcoin all the way. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:58:11
Oh absolutely. I agree 100%. I’d go as far as saying that’s a certainty.  As much as I feel BTC will outperform the 3 stocks I mentioned above, I believe there are other cryptos that will outperform BTC as far as growth is concerned. I’d be surprised if BTC wasn’t unseated as the leading market cap coin somewhere down the line. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 21:13:20
Yup, but I chose 3 stocks specifically with household names. There are a ton of lesser known stocks that had much higher gains. Comparatively, there are a ton of shitcoins that had stratospheric gains...the majority, if not all of them, will eventually end up in the crypto graveyard.

Can’t argue with you there. Facts are facts ��

I'm new to Reddit. Was expecting some feedback by now :(. Maybe I posted this incorrectly.  Way too frustrating of a day trying to figure this out. Don't think it's meant to be.
