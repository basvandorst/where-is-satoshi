$4,500 actually.

Why would he destroy his coins in this fashion is the only question, if 'he' wanted to destroy them he would send them to a burn address.

It's actually grown infinity since 2009 as it started at 0 ������

Not adding replay protection is not the same as 'killing other chains or attacking others'.
No where in the whitepaper does it mention adding replay protection when hard forking.
IMO it's in everyone's best interest that the minority chain die a quick death.

Actually both Nvidia &amp; AMD are making specific mining cards not able to do anything else, also, you can't mine bitcoin with a GPU which I'm sure you're aware of.
I had read some attributed Nvidias recent rise to this fact, they certainly do in but I'm not certain on if that has anything to do with it.
May the lambo gods also be with you.

I fail to see what's wrong with that.
Would you be ok with that fact if he was referring to segwit2x?
The minority chain is no longer bitcoin by design, it's literally written into the whitepaper.
Not stating I support one direction or the other, or even that I know what's going to happen but in my opinion what ever chain achieves the most work holds the title of true bitcoin.

Cloud mining is a waste of your money unless it's to support the protocol or vote in a specific way
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:26:37
Which has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
It's more due to them making GPU mining cards for other coins like Ethereum.

"My node will never run 2x and that's all that matters"
Actually it sounds like its you who's overestimating your importance.

The question is, who's going to add them.
Bitcoin is nearing final product at this point, the core developers are simply unwilling to adopt any major changes into the protocol so I don't believe the argument that bitcoin will simply absorb any advances from other cryptos.
There are plenty of upgrades already available they could implement, for instance Moneros ring-signatures to enable privacy at the protocol level.
Not going to happen.

Such a strange thought process.. imagine logging on since holding since 2009 to see your bitcoins had been confiscated because you hadn't touched them..

I agree that there is still development ongoing but are you aware of any layer 1 changes in development?
I have only read about level 2 developments on the horizon, such as lightning network etc..

800k specifically my math was a bit off, so more like 98-99% I guess.
Considering these 'shitcoins' you speak of have taken my networth up 500x or more in 1.5 years I'm pretty content with where I'm at.
I'm a seasoned hodler, a drop of 50% doesn't scare me but I have complete faith in my portfolio thanks.

80% Ethereum, 10% Bitcoin, 10% ETH tokens.
I have about 15k in the bank but crypto makes up 97% of my net worth.

As someone who uses Xero for their small business, this is monumentally great news.
Xero are a leader in their space.

For instance, if you were a fan of segwit2x or bitcoin cash you could buy a cloud mining contract to support those forks instead of bitcoin core, or the other way around.
