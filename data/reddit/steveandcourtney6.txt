This is the bitcoin blockchain, including the latest transactions, simplified in a few ways. The columns of the wall are blocks of the chain, going back to 2009. Time is unevenly (logarithmically) sampled for simiplicity. The rows of the wall are bitcoin addresses. Instead of a row for every bitcoin address, each row is the 3rd character of the address. The grayscale value is the largest bitcoin holding in that block and at that address. The dashed lines are the latest transactions. The line starts at the block and address holding the senders coins, and ends in the new transaction pool on the right. Every ten minutes (on average) the new transaction pool is confirmed into a block by a miner. Thus a new column will be added to the blockchain, and new transactions will begin again.

If the new block was found quickly, the column may contain few transactions, thus appear as a mostly black column.

Every public key has that many private keys?

I put a description in today's livestream.....

Those are blocks which were found very quickly after the previous block, meaning that they have very few transactions in them. it is even possible to mine empty blocks, which would make the vertical column completely black.

Thank you. I plan on doing a short write up in the next few days. The visualization is a python matplotlib figure. Python pulls data from my bitcoin node (RPC call to bitcoind) and updates the figure like 5 times per second. Then I have youtube livestream that window on my desktop.

Yes. Every public address has its own unique private key. What you may be confused about is the "seed" passphrase used to backup and your wallet. This seed is used to start an algorithm that generates new public and private key combos. So even though the new address has a new private key, it can be recovered using the same backup seed passphrase. That's only for the same wallet though. A different public address in a different wallet will have both a different private key and a different backup passphrase.

Description: This is a visualization of the Bitcoin blockchain. The blockchain is the database of transactions (a ledger) between bitcoin addresses. This database is distributed identically, in a peer-to-peer manner, to thousands of nodes and millions of mining machines. The combined computing power of the bitcoin network far exceeds that of any super computer in the world. The animation above illustrates the blockchain as a brick wall in order to provide a simplified understanding. 
New transactions: The dashed and colored lines are the latest transactions on the bitcoin network. The line starts at the block and address holding the senders coins and ends in the transaction pool on the right. The transaction amount (in bitcoin) ranges from 0 to 1000 as shown on the right. Every 10 minutes (approximately) these transactions are collected, verified, and stamped into the blockchain by a miner. 
Block time: Each column of the wall is a block meaning that it contains the transactions that have occurred in the network since the last block. Time is unevenly sampled in the visualization to show all of the recent blocks, but only a sparse sampling of the older blocks going back to 2009. 
Grayscale values: The grayscale value of the bricks in the wall represents the amount of the largest bitcoin holding in that block and at that address. The bitcoin amount ranges from 0 to 1000 btc as shown on the right. 
Address space: The rows of the wall are bitcoin addresses. But instead of a row for every bitcoin address (a practically infinite number), each row combines all address that have the same last letter of the address. The last letter of the address is shown on the Y-axis label on the right. 
Dark columns: If a block is found relatively quickly after the last one, or if the network was unusually quiet, then the block may contain few transactions, meaning it will appear as a mostly black column in the wall.

Hi everyone. We're long time lurkers / first time posters, Steve and Courtney, and we're creating a new bitcoin livestream show on youtube. This video is a demonstration and explanation of a new blockchain visualizer that we created for our show. Check us out, thanks!

I hadn't thought about that, but maybe I could upload to code to github so everyone can run it.... will think about it.... thans
