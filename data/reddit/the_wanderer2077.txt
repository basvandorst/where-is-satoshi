But if it keeps going up people are going to be less willing to spend it thinking that they could have gotten a better deal. A currency who's value is not stable goes against the necessary properties of [money]( As an example let's pretend Bitcoin had a 1 to 1 relationship with the USD to start with. If a pair of socks cost 3 coins today and you bought them it'd be like spending $3, but if tomorrow Bitcoin is now worth $3 to 1 coin it would feel like you had spent $9 on a pair of socks and as a result would be less willing to spend any coins at all.

I think the problem is that the value of cryptocurrencies needs to stabilize before merchants are going to be willing to use it. Right now  the value is going up primarily off of speculation. If speculation is the driving force behind it's value what will stop it and allow it to stabilize? What will prevent it from simply continuing to snowball?

Let's hope. It certainly would be nice particularly when traveling.

I mean I'd be fine with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if people actually used them as currency. However as it is now people are using it as an investment which defeats it's whole purpose. If the price is so volatile no one is going to be willing to spend their bitcoins out of fear that the bitcoins they spent would drastically increase in value and thus making whatever they purchased seem a lot more expensive than was initially thought. The purpose of currency is to be an exchange medium, but if that medium's value is constantly fluctuating people won't be willing to use it.

Ok, but isn't the main reason it's value is rising is because of speculation that it will keep rising? In other words people are investing in Bitcoin not because they think it's an amazing and useful currency, but instead because they expect the value will keep rising and thus they can make money essentially out of thin air.

Zimbabwe had to [switch]( currencies to the USD because of how unstable it's currency was. That Wikipedia page from earlier also specifically had a section saying one of the properties was stability. Why would you spend a Bitcoin on anything today if you thought it's worth will go up tomorrow.

Ok we'll see what happens. It'll certainly be interesting for the next couple of months/years

The difference being tuition increase was over a span of 30 years where as Bitcoin has only been over ONE year. Tuition is definitely overpriced and bank run loan programs doesn't help, but Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency and with as volatile a price as it is it's not a very good one. It's the [Dutch tulip bubble](  all over again.

Sure getting paid in Bitcoin is fine, but have you spent any of your Bitcoin on actual goods and not just other cryptos?

I think it'd be great if the world shifted to decentralized currency but you also need to be realistic. It's not really a savings account if there is a fear that you could lose a lot by simply holding on to your medium of exchange. It's also not a great medium of exchange if there aren't many vendors willing to sell their goods using the medium of exchange. I think blockchain and similar technologies have a lot of potential, but at least for the moment I don't particularly think currency is one of them.

That's a certainly reasonable assessment I think, though I'm still unsure how that'll work since Fiat and crypto kinda seem like an either or choice. I mean if you're paying in Fiat cash then you lose out on the advantages of auditing every transaction like with cryptos.
