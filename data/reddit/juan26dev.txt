Knowing that he is the owner of the first block which is Genesis. His computer had to be active for a certain time after the first block was created  to be able to validate transactions

I have sent some btc to Uranus just to see how long it takes. Please confirm
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:59:35
Can you live without that money? If the answer is yes you can consider this option. Otherwise just play it safe. I only recommend to invest with money that you can live without.

Why to worry. You won't be alive when the last bitcoin was mined anyhow
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:09:20
Lol I answered the same before. By the time the mining stops you won't be alive. So why to worry?
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:50:03
Never selling
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:21:14
Will happen like when it hit 9000, there will be a sell-off at 10000
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:51:28

Fees will be used to reward miners after all the bitcoins have been mined. Also bitcoin scaling solution lightning network is faster and really low fees.

@_date: 2019-05-14 23:03:55
We will be a generation of holders
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:07:13
It was 6k and pulled back, then went to 7k, I believe this is just a small pullback
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:59:44
I made the mistake to not purchase when it was 6k, purchased on 7k and still in profit, so do it while you can.
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:23:38

Mining but still need money to get some mining rigs
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:30:16
Bitcoin just had to hit 8000 to start to get this again
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:40:05
