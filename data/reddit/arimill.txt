Sorry for the noob question here but how had Bitcoin failed as a store of value?
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:18:31
First coin to implement lighting? I thought Litecoin already had it. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:23:54
But if I decide I want to sure lots of money in a crypto now as a store of value, what are the advantages, if any, in storing it in Bitcoin instead of the other alts that also function as faster means of exchanges?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:15:05
I never got that argument though. Why can't I store large amounts of money in an alt?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:02:55
Can someone update me on why everyone hates coinable now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:09:39
What's the argument for price manipulation and insider trading?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:16:57
Yes my bad.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:06:09
So is the accusation that they allowed a group of people to trade before it went public, that this made the price rise and then only allowed further buying by the public?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:14:42


On other exchanges right? Because they obviously couldn't use coinbase before coinbase offered that capability. 
So if that's the case, the argument for insider trader is the following:
While Bitcoin difficulty increased, BCH rose 30%. Immediately following this was Coinbases offering of BCH at a very high (set) price. This suggests that people knew that Coinbase was about to offer. It also suggests that Coinbase timed it this way on purpose. 
What I don't get is why the price went up on Coinbase right away. Wouldn't these people who were insider trading want to sell right away thus tanking the price?

I'm seeing accusations of insider trading but I'm not following why they think that there was insider trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:31:10


This was in reference to the difficulty increase, not the price increase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:02:52
Ah got it, so the initial price + the timing. 
Is the disabled sell button part of it too?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:17:22
That's pretty common on Twitter actually.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:50:01
Oh, 100%. This recent surge is showing how young this sub reddit really is. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:27:31
My question is what happens if my bank account doesn't have the proper funds. Not at what price I will buy it at.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:40:14
Yes, mature is the word I should have used. I tend to ignore the immaturity but I felt the need to chime in here because of this specific post. I'd love for this sub to be more about bitcoin news rather than a reaction gif to each increment in the price.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:51:07
Thank you, I appreciate hearing both sides. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:31:18
Great response, thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:40:21
Oh come on. I don't agree with him either but you don't need to call anyone who disagrees with your views on crypto a shill. Better to have sceptics in here than to have a pure echo chamber. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:07:18
Could you break down why 2X and BCash are moves towards more centralization? I'm trying to more about the current ecosystem, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:55:34
What's the current cost to mine a coin?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:03:31
Since the price is locked in at purchase it's not really a big deal if your don't plan on doing anything with those coins for 5 days. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:28:24
Great points. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:26:07
I think it's incredibly over priced right now.  The price seems to be climbing much faster than adoption which streams bubble to me. I'm not complaining because I'm making money off of it but it is concerning for the long term. 
This sub is also way to price focused when it should be focused more on the more important adoption news. 
Finally, add fees continue to grow I can see Bitcoin every being used for day to day purchases and would need something like Litecoin for smaller purchases. The issue, however, is that as Litecoin grows similarly then we're going to need a new crypto underneath Litecoin. And the pattern would continue.

Wait what happened with Coinbase? I placed an order with them about a week ago and am waiting for my deposits on the 29th.
