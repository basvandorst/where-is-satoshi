Objectivity and factual discussions?

Skip bitcoin and just go for ethereum

It's a more stable and well built system. Here is a good article describing the differences 
 I've read that *if* crypto is indeed the way of the future, eventually ethereum will overtake bitcoin as the number one currency.

I disagree with that. It's so volatile now that it's not worth sinking money into it, especially with how long transactions can take.

I made my first purchase last week at $500. It took the bank 9 days (5 business) to process it. Coinbase is a solid app to purchase from especially for a newbies like us

I was referring to the past 4 or 5 hours.

I'm a total noob at this. My advice is wait. It has gone up way too high too quickly and is due for downturn, everyone here knows it whether they admit or  not. I'm pulling out my investment in the coming hours and reinvesting on the dip.

I wish there was a much simpler explanation of all this

I'm on pins and needles waiting for the bubble to burst. Once it does I'll sell then re invest once it levels off.

I think its finally starting to level off.

I was wondering why there was little to no discussion on this huge rise over there. However, as extreme as they are on their views, there is that same extremism on this side of things with people swearing it's going to 10k by the end of the year. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin is a solid investment and throwing a few percentage points of your portfolio won't kill you, but it is due for a bubble pop. Until then, choo choo

I'm actually happy that BTC is stabilising a bit. If you truly believe in the cause stability is what you want
