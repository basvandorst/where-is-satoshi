Where have you been? It made a comeback weeks ago.

You do realize that both of those things use semiconductors made at the same plants that AMD and Nvidia use, right? I suppose you're going to bring up Apple next?
Yes, it is harder to make a semiconductor fabrication facility than it is to make an assembly plant. You have no idea what you're talking about. Why do you think we don't already have more GPU makers?

Some asshole made a new type of crypto currency that is ASIC-proof because he hates people.

Or you could just limit clocks to base for that game...

In fact, those self-driving cars *use Nvidia technology you goddamn idiot.*
If it's really as you describe, why is he not already doing it for his cars? Why don't Apple or Google own their own fabs? Why is Microsoft using AMD and TSMC for their consoles? Hell, *why aren't AMD and Nvidia using their own fabs?* Especially AMD since they also make CPUs and are losing to Intel largely because Intel has their own fabs? Let me guess, you're also anti-net neutrality because you believe the free market is flawless and infallible, right?

"A bit" 
The mid-range is dead. Only the 1080 and 1080 Ti are options now. If my GPU dies, I'm fucked and I have to either go back to console gaming or give it up altogether. Fuck you greedy, selfish, lazy, rich assholes! No, I won't tell you. Look it up yourself!

There's a new currency that was designed to not work well with ASICs because the inventor of it is a selfish fucking asshole. He only cares about his stupid currency not crashing and is willing to permanently fuck over PC gaming to achieve that goal. It's just fucked now. Unless a miracle happens, it's over for the mid-range PC gamer for the foreseeable future.

Hope you learn to earn a living lazing ass.

And all it had to do was kill the majority of a market segment to help the rich get richer. Yay. 
I'm not falling for this bullshit. It's all lies. At the very least it needs to be limited to no more than 2-4 GPUs so that it doesn't fuck people over.

You don't know what you're talking about. The way that the semiconductor industry works doesn't allow people to just jump in. You're talking about building a new fabrication plant. Making one that's competitive would take over a decade and tens of billions of dollars. It's not reasonable. There's a limited capacity, especially these days with smartphones everywhere. Capitalism isn't some perfect system that can make anything work out in the end. All that can happen is one of three things:
1.) Customers spend more by going with the high-end
2.) Customers go with a substitute product, such a console or laptop
3.) Customers just give up on gaming altogether
That's it. Oh, and since you're probably confused, AMD and Nvidia design GPUs. They don't manufacture them. Fabrication plants handle that. So, to increase capacity there would need to be a new plant... and then AMD and Nvidia would have to invest R&amp;D to get the GPUs working on their nodes... and nodes take years to develop even when they're not made from scratch... You have to be woefully ignorant to think, "oh, there will just be a new competitor because capitalism." My economics professors would laugh in your face for thinking it's really that simple. And don't tell me that you know about economics when you didn't even consider opportunity cost or substitute goods as factors.
