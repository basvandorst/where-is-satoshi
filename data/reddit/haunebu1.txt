I wonder if it's difficult for an owner of a cryptobond, to create an altcoin based on the value of his cryptobond, and distribute it to regular Joe's, so they can trade it on one of the existing crypto exchanges.

 Turkish Lira took a huge hit.

Words can't describe how much this guy's voice annoys me.
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:42:02
lol, BTC dropped 16% over the past 30 days against USD, but gained 13+% against the Ruble. 
Dem Russki's holding BTC over the past month are doing well!!
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:13:36
I'd changetip you, but I haven't taken the time to learn how to do it :P
@_date: 2014-12-31 01:55:17
You ass. He was just asking a simple victimless question.
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:38:46
This is a common misconception. Thanks to the massive paid trolling and FUD going around, people falsely assume that all of the BTC are instantly converted to fiat. The truth is, Bitpay allows you to choose what percentage to keep in BTC and what percentage to convert to fiat. Therefore, you can't really make the assumption that this is the case.
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:15:47
Usually the ones who are against it are paid trolls, so yes. It's definitely worth it.
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:59:11
I was considering them. Thanks for helping me go elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:15:34
0.000BOOBS BTC payment.
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:48:20
Considering Germany is smack in the middle of Europe, at least they still have a bunch of neighboring countries to obtain Bitcoin from where Localbitcoins is still available.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:12:08
Wow, haters be hatin'
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:13:21
Anything other than Bitcoin around here, will attract negativity.
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:26:22
+1, but I've learned to ignore them.

Why are haters so trollish?
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:01:06
I'm a hardcore Bitcoin fan, but quite honestly, I learned the basics on how to use ripple in the past few days.. I'm quite impressed. I fully support both currencies (or whatever you want to call them).
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:00:42
You're falling for the trap. Bitcoin is stronger than ever. Enough said.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:06:52
Amen. I support and enjoy using both Bitcoin and Ripple. I'm glad I bought a bunch several months ago.
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:46:48
Yes, I agree. Let's all believe this to be true, because Bitcoin always does the opposite of what we expect it to do. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 18:44:33
Its not rocket appliances, Eisenstein....
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:04:45
Go sign up at miningrigrentals.com, rent out your rig by mining X11. You will get paid in BTC. This method will yield you the highest payouts from mining.
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:09:33
Trollollolol how much you getting paid, bro?
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:32:27
They're making it sound like Bitcoin is now being backed by Microsoft...

I came in here to post exactly this.

@_date: 2014-12-12 21:30:12
Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2014-12-12 04:47:59
It makes it looks like the Dollar completely collapsed, and stayed there.
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:09:21
Damn, Microsoft really does have aggressive plans for BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:14:51
You'd be best off to watch some Andreas Antonopoulos videos on Youtube regarding Bitcoin. You'll definitely learn a lot.

Welcome to 5 moths ago.
@_date: 2014-10-30 04:28:52
Damn, this is extremely bullish if the other half ARE ready to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:19:10
Not an app.
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:25:53
This is why Bitcoin will Gentlemen.
@_date: 2014-11-08 23:32:22
That's pretty bearish, in my opinion.
Last year it's what ignited the rally.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:19:12
I received one of those as well. Worst phishing attempt ever.
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:17:47
I'd pay two BTC if my wife was allowed to participate.
@_date: 2014-10-30 03:03:06
QE4 will be starting up eventually, and Bitcoin will be pricing in for it, well in advance.
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:52:36
That only looks like a couple hours of work. Considering it can potentially save hundreds and thousands of dollars a month in fees, and protect against chargebacks, that's a pretty damn good deal.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:43:14
That's not really an app.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:54:37
Mine X11 coins and sign up with a pool that auto-converts to BTC.
Or rent your rig out by mining X11. Much better payouts.
@_date: 2014-10-21 01:12:56
I wouldn't worry about it, they're legit.
Also, now that you can instantly fund your account with $500 daily via Interac at cavirtex.com, why would you buy from quickbt?
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:16:57
Yeah, Peter Schiff's business has gold they can send you within Canada. 
Just chat up their little support dude that pops up on the bottom of your screen.
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:58:24
Unreal how retarded you trolls are. That doesn't even make any sense.
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:16:47

cavirtex.com - Exchange
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:43:14

Yes, really. It's a necessary reminder.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:56:45
I honestly haven't read anything this bullish since "BTC @ $1,200!"

@_date: 2015-01-06 19:25:08
No. Traders gonna trade.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:29:45
Yeah, since you're paying less than miners.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:07:26
This is one reason why Bitcoin will never even come close to reaching $0.00
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:58:54

Looks like they forgot their password. Yep they're insolvent. *rolleyes*

I thought poor people were able to buy fractions of a BTC.... Bits and all... I guess that's not possible....
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:08:50

Seems to be getting very close... $99 would be nice!
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:04:08
I think at one point in 2011 I witnessed it go from $30ish to under $2.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:50:20
I'm also going to hear it here last.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:10:02
Sell a certain percentage, with the intent to buy back.
That way, if the price goes down, you can look forward to buying back more.
If the price goes up, you're making money.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:35:19
These are the same type of comments people were making when BTC fell from $30 to $2, from $266 to $50, etc etc.
In case you guys have forgotten, BTC is volatile... This should be common knowledge by now...
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:09:30
What a clown.
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:13:25

Do they have these in stock, ready to ship?
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:07:56
Completely different circumstances.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:41:23
Can someone ELI5 derivates?
"In finance, a derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying entity. This underlying entity can be an asset, index, or interest rate, and is often called the "underlying".[1][2] Derivatives can be used for a number of purposes - including insuring against price movements (hedging), increasing exposure to price movements for speculation or getting access to otherwise hard to trade assets or markets.[3]"
 
 
Does this basically mean that if a million people buy Bitcoin derivates for example, it wouldn't actually increase Bitcoin demand?

@_date: 2015-01-08 17:43:50
Because Bitcoin is doing the exact opposite of dying.
Remember, Bitcoin is software, which can always be modified. Bugs will be ironed out, and security will be improved. All it needs is time to refine and there's no denying it.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:38:15
No stock, no care.

@_date: 2015-01-07 17:38:23
Only because FIAT is involved.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:49:53
Maybe they are, and that's why the price isn't dropping anymore.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:44:58
I disagree. The thing that is slowly changing is the attractive price entry points these days ;)
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:06:12
You lost purchasing power. Same shit.

I wonder how much longer until this Dollar bubble collapses and QE4 starts up.
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:01:17

Tell that to the people who bought at $1,000+
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:46:20
That sounds sketchy.
What about node operators? We have bandwidth and storage concerns...
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:35:24
Okay so what will the block size be with BIP100? I'm confused about this.
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:14:19

@_date: 2015-08-12 16:08:42
So small business is essentially being regulated out of existence...not good. Do you think it will stop at NY? This is VERY bad for small business and entrepreneurs in general.
@_date: 2015-08-28 14:30:41
Too bad Gold isn't collapsing. Bitcoin isn't up.
@_date: 2015-08-08 22:37:26
Just traders doing their thing.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:16:38
I'm doing absolutely fantastic. I have a large percentage of my value in Litecoin now, lol... Just warning people to be careful.
To be honest, it wouldn't surprise me if the pump lasted until the halving in two months.
Bitcoin is just software. It will get fixed, just wait and see. Too much vested interest to allow it to fail this easily. This isn't hard to understand.
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:45:50
Bro, you you even research?

@_date: 2015-07-24 14:45:48
I'd love to know as well. The article is extremely vague.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:56:55
Why are you spreading FUD? Don't be so cheap, pay the small two cent fee.
I have absolutely no issues sending BTC.
@_date: 2015-07-25 05:26:42
Isabella Kaminska makes me sick.
@_date: 2016-09-07 19:13:56
So what happens exactly the a blockchain bubble bursts? Will it be cheaper to buy blockchains?
@_date: 2016-09-30 12:44:14
I've had issues with delayed BTC withdrawals in the past. They are usually quick to respond to my e-mails as well. Try shooting them another e-mail.
@_date: 2015-11-06 14:57:55
With that kind of logic, no one will use cars or electricity either.
You can't predict know how it will evolve, bro.
Block size issue has to be resolved regardless eventually.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:42:45
Don't be so cheap Pay a higher fee.
My fee slider bar is maxed out in Bitcoin-QT. Never have issues.
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:13:04
They're starting to learn there is no point in low-balling the auctions, because the big players always bid over market price, so they don't even bother to register for the auctions. That's why there are less participants.
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:43:38
Tell them to look beyond the price drop.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:01:31
Might throw a couple bucks in this one too, just for fun.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:56:55
Absolutely. It's just software. Software can definitely be coded to work in sync with each other.
@_date: 2015-11-26 14:52:52
Look I love Bitcoin, and am bullish on it, but in my opinion, I'd rather have me money prone to a -0.75% interest rate, than to risk it in something as volatile as Bitcoin. It's just not ready to act as a safe haven for these purposes. Unless perhaps you use a service such as coinapult locks?
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:17:33
That's because humans.
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:43:26

If you don't like it, you're welcome to leave.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:15:53
Yeah I might throw $1,000 in there just for fun, if the price is right.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:40:31
Something sounds fishy about this.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:22:43
According to this logic, people will switch cryptocurrencies every few years when something better comes along. That doesn't make sense because Bitcoin can and will adapt. Don't forget, it's programmable. changes will always be made. Too much investment backing it as well.
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:52:43
Let me be the first to say it, because I know others will want to.

Has anyone tried 
I recently signed up for QuadrigaCX. Gonna try this one next.
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:36:42
Why don't you just withdraw it to a different wallet address? Then do that a few times before you send it wherever you need to send it?
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:42:29
I doubt those coins will ever move.
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:19:00
