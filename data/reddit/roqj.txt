If you're looking to bitcoin mine you will NEED to invest money in mining hardware. Using your computer's GPU/CPU will not make any money. 
If you are not very tech savvy but you're looking to invest/make money off of bitcoin it is easier to just buy in.

Blockchain.info will send you an email titled "Welcome To My Wallet" upon registration. Search that in your mailbox and you find your login details.
Knowing anything under 100% of your password is not at all useful as websites such as Blockchain.info will store your password encrypted.

1. People buying BTC will try to buy at lowest price
1. People selling BTC will try to sell at highest price
Events such as viral ransomware and media coverage will increase demand/interest for BTC investment, and thus will increase the price.
People who want to sell their coin (2.) will try to sell at a higher price, and buyers will always choose the lower price (1.)

Yep, the blockchain is pretty slow and high fee. This issue is trying to be resolved with the implementation of Segwit/BIP148.
