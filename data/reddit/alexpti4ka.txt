I'm afraid none of those giants will start accepting bitcoin soon since there are under strict control of government. The only way I see is creating a crypto- alternatives, like fatcats.market

Indeed, that's why we are trying to make daily transactions a new "normal" way of buying common goods. That is actually quite complicated since everyone agrees but still keep on using fiat money :)

The thing is that the more transactions out there the more value bitcoin has

It's too volatile they say. Well, price can be bounded to fiat and recalculated - I see no problem here

I agree that tech is a best answer, but pure math and tech is something that takes a lot of time. There are plenty of cool startups out there in the Valley doing really good stuff. But sitting and waiting for tech to come true is not the answer either. Doing small transactions is someting anyone can no matter are they coders, startups, marketers or just enthusiasts.

The main idea of the text is not about offending someone who's hodling, but to show that bitcoin could not only be an investment tool, but a real currency. But to become one the community must treat it as one. Don't you agree?

Not so long really! There are already international e-comerse platforms like [fatctas.market]( or alike allowing payments in all top coins.

Exactly! And the funny part is that hodlers spend crypto anyway - exchange it instead of using as currency. Gladly the infrastructure now allows to make more direct transactions, not exchanges.

Currency is money in common use. If you can only exchange it not using in direct way (I'm not talking about deep web now) — is that a currency?
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:15:34
I believe anyone should be able to use any coin, if both sides agree

Well, there is a huge potential indeed behind the technology itself, but I can't agree that hiring a lot of people = market exponent growth. I hate than someone compare cryptio with .com bubble, still a lot of companies collapsed that days and a lot of people lost their jobs while market was divided by big players. What we have now is that people started to think twice (or more) before investing in ICO, new companies earn way less than couple of years ago while ad expenses are growing (big players just got all top placements and ready to pay x10 for it). My point is that a lot of companies + a lot of hires not always means positive market dynamics.

Hah, I'm good, love it :)))
