Yes, I like echo chambers :) 
Nothing like asking the XMR subreddit if I should buy more
Or the Eth sub if I should buy more
Or the used car salesman if I should buy a car from him.

Just think about how many more attacks the crypto community has had to endure compared to the average Joe. I can't help thinking all of this will pay off in the future when we will be some of the most security conscious internet users out there. Hacks are only growing, and the everyday person has no clue how to spot a scam or defend themselves, we are in a unique position that forces us to step up our game. We will be thankful in the end. In b4 everyone gets hacked ��

I spoke to a couple patent attorney friends several months ago about cryptocurrencies (just to get an opinion from relatively wealthy and educated investors), and this was one of their concerns. Those within the establishment see anything outside of it as having almost no chance of succeeding. I guess it is only natural, once you embed yourself in the current system, spend decades making a place for yourself within existing infrastructures, anything on the outside starts looking strange. 
Second most popular critique of investing in cryptocurrencies, which I believe has some validity, came down to not knowing which implementation (blockchain based asset) was going to come out on top after the initial flurry of development. Think trying to pick a winning horse based on its embryonic state.

You can check out medium.com/ for a couple articles! Then of course you should listen to laura shin's podcast 'unchained,' install blockfolio for news and coin tracking, check out shitcointalk for trading info, and use the smithandcrown site for a more in depth view of different ICO's. Crypto twitter isn't too bad either, mainly just find a corner to explore, then slowly keep reading until you get more and more info. Dive on in and you won't regret it!
