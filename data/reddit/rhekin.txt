If your mom yells you to sell, this means every woman is yelling this to their husband and son.
Might be a big problem, if you are the only hodling  than you are the only one losing.

I really can´t believe someone is really this retarded.

It is kinda true, I just hope when this bubble pops that it won´t affect my stock portfolio
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:59:05
no, hell  no.
It is a bad idea, because like you.
Most people get their knowledge from this board.
So if all of the retards here who dont yell HODL are selling on a dive; it will dive extremely fast.

Everyone is being greedy with bitcoin, which makes me fearful.

A correction to zero is logical, the same price as monopoly money.

But nobody is investing in the technology, everyone is only buying the commodity for speculation.
Too many people who know nothing about finance are spending way too much on a speculative commodity with nothing to back it up.

First you buy 100 million of 1 commodity at 10k, than you bet it will reach 1 million.
2 weeks later it is worth 20k and you sell 10 million, 9 million profit in your hands and your other 90 million doubled to 180 million

It is like saying. don´t worry if this vulcano makes noise, it never exploded. 10 years go by, 10 times it made noise. Everyone laughs with the people who moved away. Then the 11th time it explodes,
how could this be??? 
Nobody knows shit about the future of bitcoin, the only thing that is certain is that it is a very risky investment. And that a lot of people who are in it don't know what they are doing.

This coin is fucking up electricity and is becoming a serious bubble which will destroy so many people their lives when it bursts.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:04:49
You know someone who believes in bitcoin has paid all the BTC lambo´s. It is the believers at the moment who paid for the wealth of the people who went out and are now rich!!!

Dont worry about it, if you had invested money while also really needing it.
You would have probably sold at 10/100/1000.
Don´t think about the past and start working harder now for realistic goals: good education, job or anything other that you have a passion for.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:07:40
Where do you think all this money is coming from?
All of the other investors, every new investors pays the one who stops investing.
Suddenly nobody will invest anymore and than it will fall down really hard. It is just thhe question who will be the last buyer who will end up with nothing.
HODLing was good, it might be good in the future. Nobody knows, the only thing we know for certain is that the future will show us.
But I think that going out right now isn´t stupid. Staying in is really risky. It all depends on how you manage this risk. And how big this risk of bitcoin is for your entire investment portfolio. 
An entire portfolio which is invested in the bitcoin speculation is crazy.

How are you investing in bitcoin by buying bitcoins?
You invest in a company if you buy stocks of the company or buy the product of that company.
But bitcoins are a product of miners, you are NOT investing in blockchain if you buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:58:03
Yeah true, BTC is trash.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:08:18
It is because bitcoin is gold and all the other coins are also gold but they just have a different color.
So you have blue gold and everyone likes blue gold.
But every day someone is making another colour of gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:47:03
Because some people already made huge profits on bitcoins but people keep trying to milk this cow.
Eventually someone is gonna pay for all the people who became rich beforehand.
It is not normal that bitcoin went up this much in such a short amount of time. There are too many people in bitcoin who dont know what they are doing. It is all around greed when people use their life savings and loans for a speculative and volatile commodity
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:11:49
Don´t worry, new years will give a nice BANG!

If a country would do this, the country would go broke instantly.
Countries make their own currency so they can become flexible. This is one of the biggest problems with the Euro.
THe bitcoin would be the worst currency imaginable.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:18:05
You know that inflation of the amount of new coins is bigger than the inflation of the dollar.
If you get 1% new coins every day, isn´t that also flooding the market with imaginary money?
At the start of this year bitcoin had a higher market value in non fiat terms compared to all the other imaginary coins.

Everyone who bought bitcoins lost all the money  that they have invested.
The amount of people who won with bitcoin is equal to the amount who lost with bitcoin. There is someone who buys and someone who sells.
The people who still have bitcoin at the moment dont know yet what they are.
It is only the people with real money who won, and only once who bought and sold lower who are already real losers.
It doesn´t matter how much a bitcoin is worth if you haven´t sold it yet. You don´t have anything yet.
