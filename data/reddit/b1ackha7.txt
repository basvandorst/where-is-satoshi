I am as well, but when it's nice to have the option to make opportunistic purchases when available.

$5000 is high, but I guess that's the price you pay to get it now. 
Supply and demand.

In this market, where people are trading at high frequency. It appears to me, coin base is not a contender. I would suggest you go to a place like bitfloor, where you can deposit your money, and buy and sell in real-time, minus the lag that is.

Very Nice Sir! I bought 2BTC when they were $75, and I'm just going to ride this whole thing out. I bought a few more on some of these dips, I will probably hold pretty tight to those as well. 
Good luck!

Since it isn't regulated, that's the big question. It's not going to be long before Uncle Sam notices the tax revenues they are missing out on.

"Over 3600 transactions have been completed in the first 25 days of March this year with a value of over US$2 million (A$1.91 million), Bitcoin payments processor BitPay reported." Bitpay being the payment processor of Avalon... coincidence?

Interesting

Is bitinstant safe? any how fast does it fund?
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:39:51
Already doing this. Made some opportunistic buys in the past week or two. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:29:47
I don't think the government can retroactively enforce laws further than a year, but they can instate laws for the current tax year.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:46:27
yeah, this has scam written all over it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:24:23
I think you're right. Seems to be stabling out finally. Thankfully, I'm a long-term investor. :)

That 3rd Batch was this morning. Looks like they simply moved their site back to the standard layout. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:27:31
The internet got it's start with porn. Look at where it is today.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:38:27
Thanks, for the opinion. I saw the third batch come and go form avalon. 
I'm thinking my best bet would be to get a few of the little singles, through BFL and see if I can get them quicker with the lottery queue jump thing they have going on.
Other than that, day trade the Bitcoin market. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:22:05
This appears to be inflation due to the recent Avalon sale. Once they sellout I predict the rate of purchase to decline. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:40:10
Look at the charts and you tell me.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:58:04
This is not always true. When the price drop below a certain threshold, they freeze purchases by saying the exceeded their limit, but when the price raises over the threshold, they easily lock the price, and take your money 5 days later
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:12:33
I'll have to finish doing the math, once I find out how many are being sold in this third batch. I will update if I find anything interesting. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:02:23
No to which question? This is not a yes/no question.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:59:04
I don't think he is very far off!
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:02:33
Where this is true, I feel the price may also decline since it's currently being inflated by people buying BTCs to purchase Avalons.
This is why the price was driven up. IMO
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:41:13
Very true. I was just watching the charts, and couldn't get this scene from the IT crowd out of my mind. So I thought I would share it with Reddit. Now IT crowd fans here I guess...
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:09:42
Haha, if I had BTC to spare I would tip you.

As a What user, I'm appalled and disagree with everything you're doing here. For shame! 
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:24:34
Litecoins are interesting. I've stayed away from the other currencys, but maybe getting in on these is a good idea. 
Thanks okaycan
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:35:43
What did you buy at?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:19:40
 but arcas0 is right. Not much to watch. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:24:46
Well, never using wepay.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:42:37
I feel there are better online banks in the market. If I were going to create a secondary account, I would probably go with Ally or PNC.

Unfortunately, with all of these new traders in the market. The Bitcoin market has become a high frequency trading market, and with the swings showing up within days, sometimes hours. 5 days is to long for me to make a purchase. I'd rather deposit my money at an exchange, knowing I can buy and sell in real time. People complain about Mt.Gox having a lag of 11, 5 days is out of the question. Coinbase needs to update their model if they intend on remaining competitive.
Also I have seen there selective buys and sells bases on the market price first hand. This type of practice is under handed and takes advantage of early adopters, and they should be exposed for it.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:22:53
I hear your frustration. The "over the limit" lockout, is a method for them to control what price they sell at. Once the price goes under a certain threshold the "over the limit" lockout is put in place, but once the price goes above the threshold, then they will sell it at market rate.
I for one see this as shady practices, and feel much more comfortable placing my money in an exchange that I can buy and sell in real-time at proper prices.

I've lived in Chicago for 7 years, and I've seen condos get rented out for as high as 3400 for a 3BR with every appliance and nicety included. 
Normal Rent for a avg. 1BR is around $800-1300 and a 2BR can range from $1100-2600

[bitcoin.clarkmoody.com]( is my favorite chart. I use it more than [bitcoinity.org](

BFL isn't a scam! They've sold previous products before, and have always delivered. Now delivering on time is a completely different story. With their previous products, estimated delivery was off by several months, but they did eventually deliver.
EDIT: Grammer 
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:57:18
Nice to know.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:59:58
I wouldn't purchase with coinbase. They have a good point of sale option, but if you want to purchase bitcoin I would look into bitfloors options. Using localtil is easy, and now that I have a cap360 acct, it's even easier. Don't get fooled.
