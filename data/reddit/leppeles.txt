I suppose they not sending txs one by one, on each person's request. Instead they put multiple requests in one single tx, so now they are paying the 10-20 bucks tx fee for like 30 users at ONCE. (at least that's what poloniex is doing) 
It's called batch transaction IIRC.

Thanks! I went on with your method and tried to buy some coffee, but the transaction failed with errorcode RouteNotFound :(

Neat! Is this module done by you? Because as I see MMM-bitcoin module is not equipped with charts yet, and I really want to use something like this for my own smartmirror.

In my country there's a site where you can buy btc with bank transfer and since fees went up, 1-2 months ago they started to charge you more than 20 bucks as a "tx cost" regardless of the amount... Despite the fact that they use tx batching and segwit.. They're still doing this, like the tx fee is still high...
Some companies just not that dynamic I guess.
Not doing business with them since then.

I sent some through gdax like 10hrs ago. It was 456 sat/byte...

Andreas Antonopoulos clearly wins on this.

I'm pretty sure that this is because of some insane amount of hashrate joined in the last few days. I'm assuming this because the blocks are following each other after like 5 minutes (or even less).
Have a look at the last column:
They can eat away the mempool 2times faster at this rate. The next difficulty adjustment is [~1180 blocks away]( If no hashrate leaves, this will go on for a few days and I hope we'll be *way* below 100k unconfirmed transactions from now on.

Does running a full node required in order to run a lightning node?
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:30:11
I've got a question on LN. 
Let's say I have a lightning app on my phone. Do I have to open a channel (and therefore adding a lightning entry to the main blockchain) each time I connect to the web and want to pay for sg? 
Assume I pay with this LN app 5-6 times monthly. If each time I'm opening a channel, the system has to write it in the main blockchain, how's this different than paying as a single nowadays btc transaction?
I get that if I'm connected and opened a channel, I'm able to pay with very small amounts of fee and almost instantly. But what if my phone restarts or losts connection? Or I'm just using this rarely?

Any idea why it is still like that? It's been half a year now...

The picture must be tampered somehow. This address only has one input and it is from 2018.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:58:46
Thanks! I thought that one has to remain online in order to keep his/her channel estabilished.


Why would I though?
If someone is on LN, my tx sooner or later will get to him/her. The fee to open another channel is highly unlikely to be smaller than the fee of going through multiple LN nodes. I'm just guessing though..
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:08:45
So, how will the blocks look like when LN is widely used? 
Will the blocks contain channel closings and openings? 
Where will LN transactions be stored if not in the main ledger? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:39:43
I know this is for windows, but would a LN node be able to run on a raspberry pi 3? Are there any system requirements for this specified? I'd be happy to give it a try. 
Thanks!

By the time btc reaches $500k or $1M, there could be smaller units than satoshi. As fas as I understand, it's not that hard to divide btc's into smaller amounts than they are right now.

Hi fellow bitcoiners,
I'm a little bit worried using bech32 segwit addresses ATM, since it's not part of the Core yet. Is there any chance that my bitcoins won't be accessible if this BIP won't make it (or will make it but with some changes)?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:13:08
Thanks for your answer. Please keep us updated if you came up with something!

The Lightning BTC denomination is kinda confusing, since it's regular BTC which went on lightning network.

TIL you are a veteran with 3 months in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:41:24
TLDR?

Can someone explain why does the value depends on the country?
