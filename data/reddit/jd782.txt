It will hit it's lowest point of the year in September but I think 5k will be tough for it to reach. 
I'm also going to have sleep for dinner if it gets much lower and I think that's the problem, there's a lot of people/bots with fingers on the triggers. 
You don't sell at 20k, you sell at $19,783.06, and you don't try to buy at 5k either or you'll be late to the party

No, seriously, there are people on the Internet spending a non-trivial amount of time writing about a currency they think is going to fail yet continues to succeed beyond anyone's expectations. I get schadenfreude from their lack of schadenfreude. Granted, a few of them are being paid to write controversial click bait and/or just concern trolling – both activities that I respect and understand. ↩
This is generally stated by people who are in the 'out-group' and fantasize about being in the 'in-group' through politics/pedigree rather than economic/meritocratic processes. Demographically, they probably overlap with fans of The Secret. Economically, they are without exception bezzlers. ↩
Bitcoin has entered its Eternal September, where every person new to Bitcoin thinks they have a unique understanding of Bitcoin and everyone ought to hear about it. There's an endless flood of newbies 'concerned' about such and such 'problem' with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community does these arrivistes a real disservice by taking them seriously instead of just telling them 'read more'. ↩
