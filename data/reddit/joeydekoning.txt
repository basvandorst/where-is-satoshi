I read through all the comments down to here, and I think this one clears it up for me the best.
It seems like banks have never had any reason to modernize their security and settlement systems. I don't think they have much of an incentive now, except that they truly could lose the security battle without changing something (e.g. these SWIFT multi-million $ runs).  
While settlement time improvement could certainly result from "private blockchain" type updates, I've always assumed the transfer time was something of an advantage for banks? So why all of the sudden is rapid settlement so important? They're doing just fine today charging $50 for international wire transfers that take a week for no technical reason (or is there indeed a technical reason other than monetizing the float?).
I attended a blockchain meetup that discussed hyperledger fabric and the key focus was "there will always be a parent [i.e. some sort of regulating body], bitcoin will fail because scalability, this tech has so much potential."
The tech does have incredible potential...but that potential exists because of its ability to overcome stifling regulation. Hand-waving excuses like "well bitcoin will obviously fail because we need something controlled by a government" don't cut it. Blockchain technology feels like Kodak confidently rolling out Advantix, but surely there's something I'm missing here?
I really want to understand the buzz on "blockchain technology." It obviously can't be dismissed outright because a lot of intelligent people are putting a lot of real money into it. There is a reason other than "they're all shortsighted idiots," but I'm still not clear on what exactly that may be and it's difficult not to be cynical.

It is alarming, and of course there is a chance that many here are over-optimistic. I still think there is a good chance that the corporate passes are based on a tough learning curve and general ignorance on blockchains. My experience with the "blockchain not bitcoin" thing:
* Read about it on reddit and Coindesk
* Hear everyone at SXSW asked about bitcoin supply *thatexact* canned answer "you know bitcoin is okay, but what's really exciting is the blockchain"
Thing is -- none of those people have any idea what they are talking about...what a blockchain is, why bitcoin's has value compared to competing blockchains, what decentralization can potentially accomplish and why competitors aren't well placed to do the same thing. They happened to read the same Medium article and leave it at that.
It's true that today, those benefits aren't obvious and perhaps they won't materialize. But I do take solace in the fact that the Erik Voorheeses and Andreas Antonopouloses of the world are not only more optimistic about bitcoin compared to the general "blockchain is sexy" crowd...they are also much more informed and educated about the technology and its true potential.

You're right that there are experts in this space who do know what they are talking about and I'm not contesting that. However, the majority of "blockchain not bitcoin" regurgitators do not understand bitcoin or blockchain. I also hesitate to assume that just because a company has name recognition, they're making good decisions (or even know what they're doing). Especially when these companies could realistically be making only token efforts to feel like they are protecting themselves from a technology they are all more comfortable dismissing. It's not that they don't have smart people, but every day smart people choose to work on misguided projects for big companies for the sake of job security and a stable pay check. I've been one of those people (jury out on 'smart' ha) for my whole career :)

I want bitcoin to work so I'm automatically biased, but I just can't picture big banks running on a global and decentralized blockchain. Not having access to government support in the wake of their own failures seems like too great of a risk for them to take. I'm not sure I see the decentralization advantage from their perspective, especially if they had any sort of federally sanctioned alternative.

I hope this happens and this is still what I'm betting on. But I worry a little more every day that bitcoin is going to be the example of what not to do. 
There still is no heir apparent, and bitcoin's network effect lead may be unassailable. 
But any market cap under $100 billion in the digital scarcity space is a non entity as far as currency revolutions go.

I love bitcoin and it has several key advantages. 
But the only reason I'm not making a bigger play into monero is xmr lack of empirical hardware wallet support and security experience. 
Network effects are important. They might already be enough. 
But bitcoin is by no means "in the clear" and we can't say "meh" to an obvious problem. 
$16 billion market cap for a currency competing with obvious incompetents like the Fed (printing hundreds of billions per quarter) is pathetic. 
And I say that with most of my net worth in bitcoin. 
Most people still have no idea what bitcoin is. Dismissive closemindedness and meh parties help no one.

I'm tremendously excited for bitcoin and i grok the network effects head start. It's a big deal. 
But network effects depend on people. This was true for the land speculation that built North America and it's true today for the bonanza frontier of digital scarcity. 
Saying "meh segwit" is about as helpful (and prescient) as saying "meh being a peasant is OK, sea voyages to new continents are risky." 
Others will reach for the frontier.

I still see bitcoin's network effect advantage as worth the risk (vs any other currently existing crypto project). But nobody knows if I'm right about that.

Bitcoin will experience some serious empirical tests in the coming year. The truth is, nobody knows what will actually happen and we're all still betting that bitcoin is antifragile.

Any centralized company profiting from servicing a blockchain would have to ensure that particular blockchain never falls foul of regulators, lest the centralized company be raided / charged / fined / dismantled. So these blockchains could never be fully censorship resistant. It's true that they might offer services that people want, especially B2B finance types who want to pretend institutional control is still compatible with blockchains. Even customers might like these services better than finance today. But they would remain distinct from bitcoin because political interests would always conflict with their stated purpose.

I'm not even clear on the value they are supposed to be adding to society when this stuff is not happening. 
Bitcoin shouldn't exist. It's too complicated and relies on too many actors and incentives to model. Empirically, though, it does. And it improves.
Banking today is also too complicated and relies on too many actors with too many motivations to model, but they also have bribery and bamboozlement in their toolkit. Empirically, it's been able to bamboozle its way into prominence for decades at a time before people figure it out. 
The internet, and its gradual attacks on bamboozlement, together with bitcoin and its empirical outperformance of the legacy system --- not looking good for the bankers.

Then you throw in First in First Out and the net impact is like, a 23 cent loss (Bought my first BTC in the $800s baby!). 
Anyone who knows anything about bitcoin knows this is absurd. But that's not the point. The point is to paint bitcoin and its users as sinister before too many people learn about the technology. In a world of increasingly perfect information brought by the internet (and increasingly insane government debt brought on by governments), ionic columns and phds are becoming less and less effective at convincing people to "trust" the government with their money. So what options does the IRS have? Demonize, and preserve ignorance.

:) much appreciated. I never said I was making a good argument, only that many of the comments (and in general the post) participate in the "circlejerk fallacy."
Bitcoin is a complicated system with multiple interacting inputs and outputs that play out on a globally connected network over years and decades, ultimately dependent on the reactions of humans. Recognizing the ultimate impossibility of actually predicting the relative merits of competing changes, both sides of the blocksize debate are having ad hominem parties. 
Read a few posts in (and then read this one. Classify however you like. It's not a good direction for debate. 
Personally, I run Core and don't have nice things to say about either. I see my bitcoin positions as a bet on the antifragility of the network...not a vote on which bitcoin personalities are the most laughable and which bitcoin future they happen to support (it is, after all, entirely possible that the most laughable personalities will be right for completely accidental reasons).

I'm not sure who is claiming that BCH has higher tx volume than BTC. The only thing this perhaps establishes, though, is why BCH continues to trade at lower USD prices than BTC.
Bitcoin users know that BCH has lower on-chain fees than BTC. It may be politically expedient to push a false narrative sometimes, sure.

Why was BTG attacked so immediately and for so much money, but not the "other fork"?
Surely with so many reddit posts about how easy and inevitable it would be, it would happen. It shares a mining algorithm and has a higher market cap.

Bitcoin Cash transactions will confirm in the next block for 1 satoshi per byte. This has been true for its entire history except a brief window of 2 days when you would have needed to pay 2 satoshis per byte.
You can send Bitcoin Core for...somewhere between 20 and over 1000 satoshis per byte, depending on current demand in their intentional fee market.
Avg fees for Bitcoin Cash are misleading, not "pretty obvious."
Try buying $10 of Bitcoin Core BTC and sending 20 transactions. How much do you have left?
Now do the same with Bitcoin Cash.
With Bitcoin Cash, you will still have about $10.
With Bitcoin Core, you won't.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:12:13
I dunno, I comment about the tx volume whenever it's brought up: the BCH transaction volume is extremely concerning to BCH supporters, myself included. Tx volume is ultimately a reflection of the fundamental utility that creates voluntary inelastic demand for BCH (demand through convenience).
Does it concern you that BTC tx volume has been plummeting for years? I would say vectors are more important than snapshots.
I'm not sure about the "2x or more on a percentage basis" claim. It's possible to cherry pick different time windows to make it look like BTC or BCH has had better price performance, and I don't like the tendency of using USD price as a scoreboard (not that it doesn't matter). In BTC terms, BCH has varied wildly, but is higher today than it was at the fork.


Have you considered that perhaps you have been sold a narrative so hard, you can only see malice in those with reasonable and technical disagreements? I've been in bitcoin for more than 5 years. There are compelling reasons for me to share many of Ver's goals. If a billionaire wanted to unleash a bunch of "talking meat puppets," he could probably do better than me. You can see the wild success that the BTC puppet masters have had, for example your blind conviction and desperate insults.
If Bitcoin Cash does not have emergent demand from sources other than made-up meat-puppetry, it will fail. It's concerning that the detractors of BCH think that the only metric for success is successful meat-puppetry.
Is that because you know BTC relies on this, esp outright false narratives like "store of value" and "muh Jihan China Ver faketoshi" ?
@_date: 2018-06-21 05:34:10
I say Bitcoin Core so as not to cause confusion, as we are frequently referring to both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash.
Again, why so insulting and condescending? And not only you in particular, it seems the entire Bitcoin Core position is based on condescension about the exact workings of 2nd and 3rd order effects years from now.
Of course I would hate to "garner" a "less than complimentary" response from you!
How smart do you think you are?
Bitcoin is about iterative empirical discovery, not top-down dogma delivery.
It's not concern trolling to point out that Bitcoin Core has high and unpredictable fees in comparison to Bitcoin Cash. It's the truth.

Does no one think it's weird that so many anti BCH "arguments" rely on how "hilarious" the maker finds a totally made up position?
More "hilarious" than the hypothetical explosion of my head due to the imagined fulfilment of some other technical guess: bitcoin is an empirical system.
How it works in reality is more important than imagining everyone is your enemy and they must be stupid because they don't accept false information that supports your narrative.
BTC empirically has unpredictable transaction fees. It was only celebrated as a store of value after cash as a feature was deprecated. How well has it stored value since then?
People believe what they want to be true. You may ignore reality, but not the consequences of ignoring reality.

Limited sample, yes...but there ain't no fucking way they improved the quality of that product. As the internet breaks down the restriction of information, it will become harder and harder for the Fed to sell the 2% fiction (or the new, more popular, "we're struggling to reach 2%" fiction).

Software automation, encryption, big data, history, empirical evidence, drastically lower costs of production --- today's tools offer serious hope.

Endemic and unavoidable control of your money by third parties who time and again have dropped the ball is today, maybe, possible to avoid. A lot of people are excited about it. If this excitement turns into real change, this whole BofA building -- and every other centralized brick and mortar banking structure, along with the billions in bailouts and fees and predatory financing and all kinds of negative externalities -- becomes obsolete. 
If the excitement is wrong, then a bunch of trolls were right about how we are all cursed to monetary serfdom and we better learn to love it as much as we love nth decimal places.

Peer-to-peer lending/crowdfunding could replace mortgages (again...I'm biased so I think it will). Individuals would need access to verifiable information of a borrower's credit-worthiness, which borrowers may be willing to provide in the interest of securing the most competitive rate.
Software tools to collect and analyze verifiable creditworthiness data will leave banks unable to outcompete crowdfunded mortgages.
The current bank-based mortgage process is only the "least bad" system available today. My first (and only, knock-on-wood) interaction with the PATRIOT Act occurred when I applied for my mortgage. Banks froze the entire process until I collected a bunch of signatures explaining where a cash deposit in my account came from -- burden of proof completely on me to prove that I wasn't a terrorist == congratulations, you are eligible for us to fleece you on mortgage payments for the next 30 years! 
I took it of course, so I don't have much right to complain. But I only took it because no better option was available :)

Most of my transactions have also canceled, but based on the successful connects I think a shortcoming in bitcoin/Mycelium savvyness is a bigger factor than bots/scams.
Not saying there aren't any scams out there, but I believe backpage is the prime driver behind the uptick in activity. Some of my connects were made in almost unbreathable clouds of stripper spray with people who then immediately asked me to show them how to pay for their backpage ad. Others who did not end up connecting specifically mentioned backpage or bp in pre-trade messages.

I don't think it's snake oil so much as a wishful thinking lifeline. Undoubtedly itBit's product is better than our current dead-man-walking legacy financial system.
The question is, will people still want to use banks in the long run with a better-functioning decentralized alternative available?
Personally, if my bank said "Hey guess what our settlement times have gone from 3-5 business days to instant!" I would say "that's great but you could still steal my money at literally any time, right? no thank you."
Who knows whether the general population will ever feel the same way in numbers significant enough to make banks obsolete. I'm a biased bitcoiner so I think "Bankchain" systems are only a patch, the way Comcast has started offering WiFi hotspots to customers who will nevertheless leave in droves the second a viable alternative is available. 
FWIW, Greeks are still under capital controls. I wouldn't particularly care about legacy finance t0 settlement if my money remained firmly not my money.
If you don't think [bad money drives out good]( try finding a circulating silver quarter in the United States. Once bitcoin's blockchain is more secure, more decentralized, and more tested than any Bankchain...I would bet on the same thing happening.

The systems behind why people demand these funny sheets of paper, necessitating an insured transport of bags-o-paper, is what I see as increasingly silly. 
The pinnacle of international finance: print pictures in location A, load them into bags and fly them to location B, trade them for other printed pictures, people at location B can then fly these now-spread-out location A pictures back to location A and exchange these tokens for goods and services. 
This is the most economically efficient way of doing things to date, sure. I think it's still a gross misallocation of resources given current technology.

Ultimately the censorship in this subreddit will lead an alternative forum  taking the lead. Like most serious people here (opinion, sure), I'm subscribed to all other options. I don't try posting new content in but it's still the best place for price gifs and flame wars. 
With censorship, that's all it really can be from now on. I'm excited to see more discussion in the new subs but unfortunately they are also a little heavy on censorship meta for now.

The case study in centralized failure is a nice bonus. Other options are out there, so the network effect

Just to try this on...
It's the usual double standard from Blockstream can do no wrong.
Blockstream has patents that they say will only be used defensively. They **must** be telling the truth.
Bitmain is always wrong.
Bitmain has patents related to the manufacture of mining equipment and took hours to patch the antbleed bug. Bitmain **must** be lying.
The amount of double standards, misinformation, conspiracy theories, and just blatant mud on the wall comments in is ridiculous.
The community's split might've been resolved at some stage through dialogue. Dialogue is not possible when is more interested in character defamation, lies, omissions, conspiracy theories, and double standards.

ITT many reasons to be terrified of having a large position in bitcoin. Name-calling may be unavoidable in any human social system. Sometimes it's even effective and worthwhile. 
not Voltaire. The path forward for bitcoin will be empirically validated (BU, extension blocks, UASF), not rationally revealed. 
Propaganda is part of the picture for both sides, sure. But at least stick to the memes and tone down the mock-victim diatribes.

Right -- but why is converting dollars to bitcoin classified as a currency transaction, distinct from converting dollars to, say, girl scout cookies?

I use both platforms and really appreciate the interface, ease of trading, and watching as updates and improvements role out all the time while my online banking hasn't changed, um, ever. I don't hold large amounts there and currently wouldn't consider replacing my bank account, but only because service levels haven't quite caught up (e.g. a brokerage account).
I view my bank's level of service as the "least bad" available -- trading, for example, takes days and is expensive -- so I'm ready to upgrade when the tech is in. The whole reason I got into bitcoin was the pain of a single international wire transfer, but even then bitcoin wasn't much easier due to inefficient legacy interfaces.
Unfortunately I think most of the barriers to tech beating banks are regulatory so I might be waiting a long time.
Ultimately I think both Coinbase and Circle will be able to offer better services than banks at lower costs. I'm optimistic about the possibility, pessimistic about the schedule.

This is fair, but arbitrary limits in baseball and football are known to be on the right order of magnitude. Everyone knows a 1yd field or 3 miles between bases would be terrible, even if current arbitrary distances may or may not be optimal. Bitcoin at 1mb is more complicated, as you confirm.

I'm technically out of my depth here (in that I'm not a software engineer and I don't fully understand the finer points of the source code), but I think other people in this sub might have the same view, so here goes: I'm not clear how the "handful of experts" approach is more decentralized.
It looks like the opposite. If the size of the market cap is preventing any changes already, it's possible that no one will ever be expert enough to know the change. 
Like all other human technological progress, cryptocurrency is going to advance iteratively. Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum and potential changes will have unforeseen consequences, possibly negative ones. If bitcoin can't iterate at all because $7 billion is at stake, there's a risk any network effect starting advantage will be eclipsed by the lab of infinitely-iterating open source alternatives. 
The whole *populares* and *optimates* open source back and forth is very interesting. It's such a fundamental human conflict...I know I've only been exposed to the more heated views of both sides (since I haven't gone to an in-person scalability summit). 
Anyway I don't have a solution and I don't claim to know more than external observer appearances :) 
I am optimistic that all experts, from all backgrounds, will ultimately pull out iteratively improving solutions. I guess I have already voted with my money, which is the option open to everyone.

No guarantees, but PayPal had a much lower bar to cross to become a profitable business versus banks and payment tech even more in the dark ages back then. Very hard for them to cross it when they did, but now they are just hanging out as the new bar to cross. Coinbase and Circle will have to improve on the status quo or they won't stay in business.
Of course...that's not a reason they will necessarily stay in business and improve where PayPal is (today) failing. 
Coinbase and Circle are well positioned to capitalize on bitcoin's features that could dramatically outcompete banks...IF a lot of things go well for bitcoin. Whether or not they succeed, genie is out of the bottle. Like Kodak and digital photography vs everyone else, the ultimate winner will be someone who embraces a risky subpar tech with potential for exponential growth that happens to be the right risky subpar tech.
Whether or not cryptocurrency has the potential (only arguing potential) to be vastly superior to our current financial system is something I see as a given (true for everyone who doesn't believe that mankind has reached its financial zenith in AD 2015, so everyone but If bitcoin is the winning step change in fintech, Coinbase and Circle are already better positioned than PayPal to capitalize. And they also have nonzero influence on whether or not bitcoin is the winning solution.
I'm bullish :)

I wired money to Canada from the US using traditional banking methods, and then back from Canada to the US using bitcoin. Judgment call which is easier. Because I wanted to keep the funds in bitcoin for the wire out of Canada, that was a much better system for me. But due to interfaces with legacy financial institutions it was still not ideal.
TRADITIONAL WIRE (US to Canada)
(1) Print out form for international wire transfer and fill it out in pen, with signature
(2) Fax form to my bank's special international wire office
(3) Watch as money disappears from US bank account
(4) Wait 5 days while money doesn't exist in US account or Canada account
(5) Find money in Canadian account, less currency fluctuations, other bullshit, and a fee taken from both the Canadian Bank and the American Bank
The misery of this experience (I had to wire the money to buy a car -- so I got to fill out FATCA that year and the year I left Canada for having more than $10k in my bank account for all of 24 hours) is what got me into bitcoin.
BITCOIN WIRE (from Canada to the US, not Australia, but it's about the same)
(1) Go into my Canadian bank IN PERSON because that's the only way I can get them to close my account and wire the entire balance to Canadian bitcoin exchange (I used CA Virtex at the time, also have option of Quadriga now...new CA Virtex looks pretty good too)
(2) Wait 5 days for this domestic wire transfer, less fees, but fixed and predictable ones that don't involve currency fluctuation (I think this is faster now, if you use INTERAC definitely)
(3) Buy bitcoins on Canadian exchange (available immediately)
(4) Send to any other bitcoin wallet (instant) and hodl
So it depends on your goals. If you want to hold bitcoin and do everything in your limited power to not be fleeced by the banks, I'd recommend it. Unfortunately it's also a terrific reminder that this power is incredibly limited, and fleeced you will be.
Fun fact -- when I sold my car in Canada, it also took 5 days for the funds to be available in my Canadian bank account (5 days after depositing the check from the dealership). I asked if they had to cart the gold bars from the car dealership to the bank branch by Conestoga wagon. The bank assured me this was not their system, although the funds would have confirmed in under 24 hours had they been so efficient as to use the wagon-and-gold method, so I hope they upgrade to this soon.

I was with Scotiabank in Canada and Schwab in the US. 
Schwab required the fax for all international wires. There are some banks like TD with branches in both countries that have a simplified procedure for international wire transfers specifically between those countries, but they are the exception not the rule (and usually setup is required before routine transfers are easy).
The other exception is customers with  $Frooglepoopillion in their accounts -- who tell me they have some exceptional wire system when trying to explain why I used bitcoin.

This comment is an excellent case study in the need for this subreddit to find fault and misconstrue proportion. Bitmain is doing something for the community -- I seriously doubt they expect to make a killing with this router, it's just nifty. That's not the point. It's a precursor. Semiconductors are everywhere, they are constantly using less power. This is one potential future for decentralized mining. Maybe it's a bad idea. But maybe it's not. Probably worth releasing :)

I'm not sure, but my guess would be fiat. IRA withdrawals are already so overwhelmingly regulated. In kind transfers of stock do happen, though. I'll be happy if withdrawals exist at all when I'm actually at the government approved penalty free withdrawal age. But that's a function of my skepticism surrounding US finances, not this service :)

Coinbase sees the big picture. Their mission is to grow bitcoin as fast and as broadly as possible. All of their actions make sense given their mission and operating environment. Users of Coinbase are not forced to use Coinbase. 
The rampant Coinbase bashing can only come from ignorance. Does this sub really NOT want an easy on ramp for millions of new bitcoin users? 
Look at the big picture. Use your judgment. Let the services you choose reflect your values. But there is nothing accomplished in bashing other services with fully disclosed values that are trying to maximize their impact from within a broken system.

ITT lots of people upset that Roger has not converted bitcoin.com into the solution for world peace by ending global warming and establishing a million dollar minimum wage. 
Bitcoin is a step change improvement over modern casinos. The perceived negative aspects of casinos (% of revenue going to the house, % of revenue going to the government, corruption, asinine legal systems that support converting deserts into property bubbles, organized crime, etc) are all worse for brick-and-mortar operations. For anyone who has tried to gamble on the internet, bitcoin is a godsend. 
Fully decentralized and peer-to-peer solutions will eventually be more popular. But that doesn't mean radically improving over the current system is a step in the wrong direction.

Do their investors know this? How was Coinbase able to raise more than $100m with a business plan aimed squarely at pissing off incredibly tech savvy bitcoin users between 20 and 25?
I'm not saying those things don't happen. They do, and it sucks. But all of those activities are bad for business except to the extent that the US government will shut Coinbase down instantly if they drop the ball even for a second. 
Bruce is right, the problem is the regulators. If any anger could be productive, that's where it should be directed. No one is trying to build a bitcoin business for the sole purpose of upsetting people ---least of all the businesses who have succeeded in in raising the most money.
