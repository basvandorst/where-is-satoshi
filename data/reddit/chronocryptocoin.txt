So I know many people are not a fan of Bitpay, but they are about the only option for a mobile wallet for me.  
Does anyone have any experience with them, or used the bitpay visa card? Is it possible to set up a 2 of 2 multisig wallet with a ledger on my phone?

I don't know if that is an American thing, or I'm just too young, but no bank around me has a "checking account", no one has checks/cheques anymore. We have transaction accounts, which would come with a visa/debit/atm card, and savings accounts, that usually have higher interest and you can only interact with them through the online services linking them to your main/transaction account. Therefore it would be a very bad analogy. You can't transact with bitcoin? You have a lightning network node as your everyday account?

I could find [this]( and [this]( many different numbers in there, 25% of users maybe up to 40% of young people. But very varied across the different platforms/browsers/countries etc.

Your maths is way out. First, your units are wrong, the divisor should be [btc/person] and so your result will be in units of [people].  
Secondly, he said if one person owned more than one btc, not if everyone did. Everyone else can still have exactly 1.0btc.  
21000000 - 1.00000001 = 20999998.99999999 [btc]
20999998.99999999 [btc] / 1.0 [btc/person] = 20999998.99999999 [people]  
20999998.99999999 +1 &lt; 21000000 [people].

Did you know that only about 10% of internet users use an adblock? And only about 2% of mobile users.

Anyone with less than 100 million dollars in bitcoin is a loser?

I'm sorry for your loss of your father.
