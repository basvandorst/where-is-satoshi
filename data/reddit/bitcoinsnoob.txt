What's the difference between a train crossing and the blockchain?
One blocks the tracks, the other tracks the blocks!

There is a [5 minute cancellation window]( You can click the transfer and cancel it.
After you made the mistake, why didn't you contact the company bank and ensure overdrawn payments would be rejected? Or why didn't you transfer money into it to cover the funds?
Even if Coinbase had gotten back to you, they wouldn't be able to do anything.
You made a mistake but are simply trying to blame someone else.

Wow, you are a bit of a twat, aren't you? Did you even send the email? Did you send another? Nonetheless, you decided your best course of action was to sit around with your thumbs shoved up your arse.
Take some responsibility. There are multiple support channels, here, twitter, community forums. Did you use those?
And now they are offering to discuss it, and all you can do is criticise. 
Did you think maybe they are too busy dealing with morons like you to be able to help real customers?

Review from last year, but still looks pretty relevant.

How you can compare Bitpay fee to a label fee is beyond me. Compare that to the Visa fee. Label charges don't change.

This is probably the worst justification for piracy I've ever heard.


I think your moral compass needs adjusting.


So you gave them nothing. What a great deal.


No, nothing changed. They still get the same amount they were before, just different processing fees. Just because someone takes Bitcoin, doesn't mean they are suddenly seeing 100% of it. They get their coins, convert to fiat, pay the Coinbase/BitPay fee, then have to split the money as they always did.


Is not the same thing as paying for a product.


So you have been "supporting" him all this time, by paying nothing and stealing his work. Bravo. How do you think he paid the website developers to integrate Bitcoin? On a promise that some scumbag like you would eventually pay up?

Same old sponsored promotion reprinted from Bitcoinist, Cordell and DCC. 
As far as taxes, I would suggest a knowledgeable CPA instead. Libra isn't even that good (see [review]( and certainly not free. $19 or $49.

No, you pay income taxes on the gross amount, then capital gains taxes on any profits.


You don't take it directly from the income, you have to include it as business expenses or personal expenses, which might be limited.


Yes, you use market price.

It really isn't that great, just a glorified ledger right now. It doesn't track cost basis or taxes as suggested.
If you want something that works now, I'd suggest reading this [review of Bitcoin tax software](

It costs $19.


No you don't.
Maybe you also shouldn't be stealing stock images and using them in your blog without taking out the watermarks.

No it isn't. You charge people for the transaction information that must be put into Schedule D. You can't file without it.


That's like saying it doesn't cost anything to sign up to TurboTax. But if you actually wanted to file your taxes, you need to pay. You're no different and just being dishonest.
edit: Good to see you fixed your image. As a content producer this just irritates me when I see it. However, you should still be giving attribution for creative commons images. [Here's who you should credit](
