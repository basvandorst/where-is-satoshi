Usually a deleted profile as a [deleted] tag instead of the username which I did not see in his profile. I am not sure Reddit would go to the length of banning a user based on just one post. And if the mods banned it, we should have been still able to see his profile nevertheless. This really piqued my interest.

Well, it is technically possible. We have a use case of China which blocks all communications platforms outside of its country. Why can’t it be enforced if countries collude together? Just because if has not happened does not mean it can’t happen.
Moreover, my question explores an answer of what would we do provided that happens. And not be in an illusion that it cant  happen.

Well, the US has the liberty to impose sanctions on other countries in the blink of an eye. All they need is a _stupid_ reason which would convince the masses to back a decision.

Is it just me or Reddit does not display the profile of the time traveler?

I predict that u/biologischeavocado will get exactly three upvotes for this comment.

You are super calm in handling this dickhead with a reddit age of 11 days. Truly.

9. Do not keep coins on an exchange.

Why 2.1 bitcoins? Seems someone wants to become a part of the million club.

Replace mom with gf and the conversation is the same for me.

Would be great if this gets seamlessly integrated into Ebates, and if cashback can be turned into BTC.
