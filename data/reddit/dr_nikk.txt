I just want the 2 BTC that I had trapped in Gox!

I'm sorry but this seems like spam and also a scam.

I'm pretty sure hope is what keeps most hearts beating (figuratively of course). 
@_date: 2014-02-13 12:37:15
Yes, why?

That reminds me. Still waiting on my btc from the Mt. Gox lawsuit. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:04:52
Well, sure damn well hope. 
I grew [this]( from 0.25 BTC before Gox died on us.
Can anyone log into the claims site? I'm trying to transfer my stuff over to Kraken but get stuck.

Downvotes for hurting my soul.

There's a little claims screen and I'll try to click through after filling out my info and it will not pass. I know my info is right. It allowed me to log on to the tegular gox site and check my wallet.

Could anyone log in? 
I can log into the claim site but I can't transfer over to Kraken for some reason.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:59:23
Fuck that, I'm waiting out the screen. Gox took my moneys.

I tried to get verified last year. Never went through. I gave up on it.
