A brazilian guy on youtube is suggesting this app and I want to help a friend to understand before entering in some deep shit.

Give me USD 100 in BTC as an incentive and I can surely go to you.

I think that if someone gets rid of a briefcase with 10 million dollars it is not the end of the world. What’s so scary on this? I didn’t get it.

I brought this up since in my search for a hardware wallet it looked very handy to have a connection to your smartphone, but I am not that into it since I prefer keeping it offline for real.

It is actually the opposite. Believe me when I say that most YouTube videos in my language have a lot of hidden intent to lead you intentionally to a sponsor of the Youtuber. This is not trustworthy. I would rather give more credit to this community with 1MM that for sure have some brazilian that is trading in the lesser fee payment mode. 
The two links that were posted already gave me a clue of how to! :-)

By international bank account I mean an usual regular bank account but out of my country in order to use non-brazilian wallets. I didn’t know these traders above but I will have a look on it, thanks.

I understand all of you, but in my mind bitcoin online have the same risk of my traditional bank money online. Is BTC more risky?
@_date: 2019-01-23 01:08:35
That was amazing. Thanks for the time and patience to write all of it!

I think that printed currency worthiness shall be put to discussion before 2022. I cannot remember the last time I used it for a relevant transaction. Have you?

So many onions making the pizza look like a nest of vermin.

Got that.
