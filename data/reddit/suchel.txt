The value of BTC is scarcity and a decentralized trustless exchange. The market has been pumped &amp; dumped to this level. First by whales and trading bots, &amp; now by nation states seeking to control the exchange rate. Crazy times for crypto ahead.

Noted; GBTC is a fund. Thank you. Follow the BTC  to ATH post Olympics. Perhaps, I think for sure, maybe.

Volatility will kill BTC use for purchasing products &amp; services. But that volatility attracts speculative investment and market manipulation. I see the future of Bitcoin as the gold standard of all cryptocurrencies. And currently the market powers are trying to hold value down. In the past, China shut down, market fell and rebounded stronger for being artificially devalued.

This is one of the first respectful back and forth I've ever had and Reddit thank you. I also noticed the pattern in 2017 before the 3rd quarter hype. BTC doubled market value each quarter. I can't change the past nor can I predict the future.

What's the story?
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:37:11
Great article. Bitcoin was $0.00 for the first 10 months.

Yes. I am deciding to pull my coin out this week. I need to choose cold storage or digital wallet. I'll let you know what I find out. Nice post and response. Thank you.

I'm in the same boat. Let's say we move from Coimbase to cold storage now. How do we then collect our missing BTGold from Coinbase and or future S2X fork from what exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:04:25
Agree. But make several small paper wallets, 1 satoshi, so you understand the process first. Also if you will need to fund your cash accounts with BTC in the future consider smaller individual amounts in cold storage for ease of cashing out one slip of paper at a time.

Ol post. Look at the original guy smoking. New, shot in Chicago, same position dude on a cell phone. Nicely staged by Union  Ironworkers here in Chi Town. Also note today the Chicago Mercantile Exchange became the first to promise BTC futures trading in 2017.

My bad thought I had read differently on the futures open.
35001. CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS
Each futures contract shall be valued at 5 bitcoin as defined by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (“BRR”). The minimum size threshold for a block trade in the Contract shall be 5 contracts. This represents 25 bitcoin as defined by the BRR.

I know, nice picture. Right? However... where are we going. Not down another rabbit hole. So every fork is a financed mutiny?
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:20:36
Sic. Inovation.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:32:51
The CME Group requires all futures traders to possess a minimum of 5 BTC to buy future contracts on their exchange. These people have skin in the game too.

Think of it as a software update that matches your investment in BTC with a new crypto-coin. News of the fork certainly increases volatility now, but it cannot contain the value of BTC in the long term.
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:08:13
I can now place a wager on a hedge of my BTC position. Crazy world. I'll take the over.

Lastly, I understand bitcoin gold's unication to be decentralization of miners. Perhaps my PS4 &amp; Samsung will be able to mine? What are the innovations of SX2? PLEASE.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:00:39
Bitcoin gold is matching all existing BTC in their currency for 40M USD start up? Why all the fuss?
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:31:21
I live in Chicago and have bitcoin. Not any merchant support here. Let me know how I can help. Will work for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:46:07
So why are bitcoin gold and segwit not alt coins to start? Is their advantage market manipulation? Or is it the value of their 2 man team code?
