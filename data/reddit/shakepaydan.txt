Hi there, we have tighter spreads at [Shakepay]( \-- maybe you'll want to check us out.  We also have:
\- no funding fees
\- no withdrawal fees
\- we cover the miner fee
\- you can get your funds [really quickly](
I've just checked: at this moment, our buy rate is 8545 CAD and our sell rate is 8231 CAD, which is a spread of 314. Those rates **include** our fee for exchanges.
You can sign up and make your first buy or sell [in under 10 minutes]( and start funding with an e-Transfer as little as $5.
I hope this helps!
