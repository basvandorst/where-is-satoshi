Not trying to be a dick, but have you been living under a rock the last week? All that's been talked about is today's fork.

Depends on the option you choose
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:38:04
Thank you. It's okay that I lost the money, I took the risk and figured since it was a member with high flawless reputation that they'd be trustworthy.. but alas I was wrong. I just want to make sure no one else falls victim to this guy. Despite his 100% reputation on there, he is not what that site shows him to be.
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:24:07
If they can get him to remove his phone number from his profile, it'd prevent people from getting scammed in the future. That's the least they could do to prevent it from happening again.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:25:39
that's fine i'll just create a new account and use it lol wtf. im not here to discredit local bitcoins, im here to discredit a scammer behind the guise of a high reputation account on LBTC. you seem to have a problem with me trying to take down a scammer, so you want to promote people getting scammed? does that make you happy that people get scammed?
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:35:58
He has high reputation so others are bound to get scammed,  there is no other place for me to post this on reddit, it only makes sense to post it in this sub (LBTC forums are down). I want it so that whenever someone searches this person's username, they'll find out he is scamming. There's not too many google entries for his username, so this should be one of the first the appears. Fuck nebben89
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:53:28
What? I wanted to sell my BTC, sent my BTC to his wallet, and he did not send the funds to my bank account.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:11:00
I'm not disagreeing with that.. this post isn't a critique on LBTC... It's feedback on ONE user on LBTC that I'm describing as a scammer. I'm saying if LBTC ask nebben89 to remove his phone number from his visible profile that everyone can see, then it'll avoid people from getting scammed, because there wouldn't be anyone dealing with him off-site (since there's no phone number shown on the profile). I'm not even asking that he get banned, I'm just trying to prevent ppl from getting scammed by this guy.
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:42:40
I really just want to raise awareness so that no one else falls victim. When you click on Sell Bitcoins, he's one of the top results for USD.
@_date: 2017-04-30 16:08:04
I'm buying off Coinbase and keeping in that wallet for the time being, seeing as I still have an incredibly small amount. Coinbase fees would be the same if I did a lump sum opposed to small daily fees. My thought process is since Bitcoin is so volatile, I can get it low on some days. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:09:36
and just like that, your advice is irrelevant.. thanks for the advice u/ztsmart

As I've told somebody else:


@_date: 2019-04-02 16:56:06
Best-case scenario, they'll close his account
Worst-case scenario, others will find this thread and half of them won't get scammed the same way, while the other half who do will have this thread as reference if it can help them.
Either way, I just want public awareness made to watch out for this guy
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:54:18
Yes I know, but he has his phone number on his profile, and LocalBTC should be made aware that this guy is a scammer so future users of LBTC do not get scammed as well.
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:20:41
Am I allowed to post the screenshots with his phone number being visible or do I have to scratch it out?
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:47:00
I have screenshots dude. Matter fact, why don't you text the number and say you want to buy $10 BTC and see if he does the same to you? Then we can both be unreputable about our claims that we got scammed, and wait for the next person to make the same comment as you and have them do the same thing.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:40:45
Sue nebben89 for $600? Cmon man, it isn't worth the lawyer fees for that. The best I can do to prove that I'm not the actual scammer is screen record me logging to my LBTC account, going to my transactions, and then going into my text message app and show the convo, but I'd have to hide his number because I guess it's against the terms &amp; conditions of reddit? And then show me logging onto my bank account with the corresponding account  If it isn't against the terms &amp; conditions feel free to correct me so I can do what I'm suggesting instead of trying to cloak this guy's number which is already public in the link I posted
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:52:54
I'm in the same boat as you my man. My initial "investment" was Bitcoin gambling. Initial deposit went up to about 4.7 and then lost it all. Doing small, practical daily deposits. Thinking of doing one big purchase a month. Anyone have any recommendations?
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:56:05
The best time to buy in was yesterday. The second best time is today

The last time you said something was going nowhere it was worth 800$ more the next week 
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:05:01
condescendingly saying its "clearly at a high" is rude too. and fucking dumb
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:00:28
Get mad you dipshit. It went up 800$ since you posted that. Clueless. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:42:05
"Clearly at a high"
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:01:00
Sold at 2700. Huge mistake. Buying back now because it'll be worth 10k by next year
