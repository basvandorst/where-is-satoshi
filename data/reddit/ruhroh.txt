If coins are sent to this address they will be automatically split after a random timeout using a custom script I have written

As far as I can tell you are just spamming with the hopes of deterring people from entering so you yourself have a better chance lol. There is literally nothing wrong with accepting a bitcoin gift.

You're just repeating yourself... so I ask again, proof? Do you have any kind of source to your claims?
If you cannot provide proof then you are just shitposting and making up accusations. I made a valid claim in my previous post as to your motivations.

Hey, can you expand on this a little bit please?
How can I use the lightning testnet to listen to the podcast? You make it sound like I can download the podcast through the lightning network, but I'm sure I'm missing something. Is it just that I can pay them using the lightning network? (I didn't see any way to generate an invoice or anything)

Thanks, I was below that and still haven't received any email or any notification at all, so I think I might send one off.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:27:10
Oh ok awesome, I see it now. Pretty cool.
Thanks for the explanation!

Curious, what was your order number (or maybe just a range)? I was order 1k+ and I haven't gotten an email yet - wondering if I should email them.

A-ha! That is excellent! Thank's for sharing that with me sir. 
Do you happen to know of anything similar for Origin? I only ask in case you might know, I am going to go looking right now.

Making election day that much sweeter =)! Thanks guy.
@_date: 2016-09-03 23:11:08
Thanks very much! I was having a hard time finding anything myself.

Got any links where I can read about this? Sounds interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:27:33
Another knower, checking in.

When was the last time you used it? It works fine for literally everything I throw at it.
Give some specifics... I get the feeling all of the people in here commenting how crap linux is and how there's no good software for it hasn't used linux in a _long_ time, if at all.

`apt-get install libreoffice`

Thanks for the advice -- I'm going to look into this.
@_date: 2016-10-08 22:39:25
Thanks for the link and info -- very well might end up doing this and using uber.
@_date: 2016-10-08 16:56:19
Thanks for the advice, hadn't heard of them before but I very well might give them a try.
@_date: 2016-10-08 16:40:08
Ah, many thanks!
Checking your links now -- I had forgotten that expedia accepted Bitcoin and it didn't turn up in my search results. (I checkd out cheapair earlier and it turns out they don't accept bitcoin for car rentals)
Looks like expedia is the same and does not allow Bitcoin for car rentals :(
I appreciate the other links and it looks like you're definitely correct on the private rental car front, just doesn't appear to be any that are near where I am unfortunately.
all4btc.com sounds interesting though... do you have any experience with it? Could I just paste the expedia checkout url for the rental car and it would work? The website looks a little scammy (typos and whatnot).

During my searching in the past couple of hours I came across similar advice but it seems that doing so would take a while to accomplish (funding the paypal account) whereas I need it this week -- I appreciate the advice though.
Really disappointed, I thought I'd be able to fall back onto my bitcoin for this purpose to be honest :(.
So far I think a wirex virtual visa is my best bet. Unfortunately I'm not going to be able to rent a car because they are going to require a hold (either in cash or through a cc/debit card, with a stipulation it is not virtual :(), but at least maybe I can get a yellow cab or uber. Ugh.
