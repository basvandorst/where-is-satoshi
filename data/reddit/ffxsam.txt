It’s simple: good for investing because you can deposit fiat currency, change to BTC, and sell when it goes up. Not good for real world use: try paying your rent and utilities with Bitcoin. Try buying groceries with it.

Wow, now I got a message saying my measly balance of USD $32 is not spendable because the transaction fee alone would wipe out those funds. So is BTC doomed with its 1MB transaction cap? Should I start investing in BCH instead?

Don't know, but you're [welcome to ask him](

What do you mean? The value of BTC fluctuates. Buy low, sell high.

Makes sense, since (if I understand correctly) a wallet is nothing more than a link to your balance. I'll give it a shot! I'm interested in transitioning from BTC to BCH.

I just got a comment from a guy on another post who said he was living 100% on BTC—no bank accounts.

So Bitcoin is good for investing, but not practical for real-world use? I don't understand how people live on BTC, pay rent, etc. "Sorry, I can't pay the rent this month.. BTC value dropped."

Or use Authy and just disable the backup feature, so nothing ever hits the cloud.
