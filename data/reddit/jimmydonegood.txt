Like I've been saying the whales can easily manipulate this market.  They buy tons at low prices.  Pump up the price while they get small time fish to jump in.  Then dump and repeat.

I've been seeing a pattern the last two weeks or so.  It gets pumped up then dumped and repeat.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:54:30
Seems like its being pumped up so it can drop to 10,500 again.

Whales bail out.  The hodlers left with the rubble.

I wouldn't even consider buying any bitcoins right now until it stabilizes at least for half a day.  I still see 12k 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:01
I feel bad for those that are sleeping right now can't do shit about it.  The small mom and pop investors who don't really know and aren't following things closely. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:02
I never liked the idea that one man can destroy bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:33:30
is gdax down?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:44:29
I've sold all my coins. No one wants to be the ones holding the lows. I'll buy back when it falls further.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:52
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:42
When it shows semblance of stabilization.  People are panic selling right now.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:35:48
This place starting to sound cultish.  STahpp

Good decision.  I did as well.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:51:18
I'll be honest I don't really care about the tech or anything like that.  I'm here for the gains, the profit the moolah.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:56:00
Its falling faster than I realized.  stabilize at 12K
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:49:49
Well I shouldn't really say coins.  Less than a coin?
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:47:21
That's exactly what happened in the dot com crash though.  
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:58:45
I hope no one fell for the pump and dump.  :(

Famous last words.

5k like I predicted.  If you believe the bottom has not been reached.  Better to just sell now and buy later.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:12:06
Yeah I don't think Bitcoin will ever go to 20k ever again. The overall trend is down if you look at the last few months. To reach ath would require a huge announcement or news of some sort. I just don't know what that is. Right now it feels like more manipulation is taking place for short gains. Pump and dump as you will.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:20:54
This crash is different. It's more mainstream and publicized. It feels like the ride to 20k was a passing fad for many people. Lots of people seemed to be talking about Bitcoin during its rise but I'm hearing less and less chatter about it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:19:52
People buying a ton at 7600 and unloading at 8800.  Classic pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:58:03
Everyone sell.  I want cheaper video cards.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:19:05
I was here during the Bitcoin craze. Carves tree.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:29:24
100K by December 1st. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:00:58
At least some good news, every 100 point drop means 10 dollars off a new video card.  RX 580 will soon be mine.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:05:24
So if it goes down then its an attack.  If it goes up, then not an attack.  Got it. lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:28:39
Fly you fools!
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:57:35
No. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:03:32
What is in the minds of those are buying right now?  Can someone help me  understand?  
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:20:17
People were hoping it would go to 5,000 to buy.  Let's see if it happens.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:45:04
Lets say I have 5000 btc.  Couldn't I just sell it high all at once.  Crash the price.  Buy it low.  This would increase the price. And repeat.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:53:14
I'm still waiting for the price of tulips to go up.  Any day now.

Some folks are saying the whales are the ones who will be picking up the low prices of bitcoin.  I don't think this is true.  The whales are the ones getting out.  Only way for the prices to drop this quickly, this fast.
