Unfortunately there are so many new people in this sub that it’s no longer a good educational recourse to learn about bitcoin. Maybe do some research on your own rather than looking for someone to explain. 
Eventually supply will meet demand at an equilibrium point and the price will find stability.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:19:08
Context: i tried to post this a few times but something in it keeps getting it deleted. Talking about small government and being anti socialism seems to get my post blocked. 
I added the “bcash is trash” to see if that would help but something else in the wording gets it banned. As a bitcoin hodlr, i am concerned the message behind this movement is being lost
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:41:09
Core getting segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:21:34
I miss the old libertarianism of this sub. Reminder that we aren’t just here to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:36:45
Yes, the failures of socialism are not instant.

Im glad im not completely alone here
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:10:22
Bitcoin is in development. For the time being transactions are expensive, but through innovation this will not forever be the case. Same goes for volatility. It will stabilize eventually. Maybe take an economics class then return to looking into bitcoin. Without a prior knowledge of econ, i can see how it would be impossible to understand.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:53:06
Look up basic economics. Scarce recourses which have alternative uses is not disappearing any time soon im sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:33:32
It makes the people reliant on the state. Im against all forms of welfare 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:25:08
I added that after being removed the first time to see if bashing bcash would allow me to be posted
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:38:40
Never looked at it that way, but it’s making all the subs shitty and stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:31:31
Call it whatever you want. A people that are reliant on the state is a scary thing.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:30:26
This is the evolution of our economy. Never results in mass unemployment, just people having to seek other forms of labor. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:11:22
I understand that, what im asking is why one doesn’t activate segwit as a marketing tool to have an edge on the competition who don’t have segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:15:41
I feel them lurking. I want to take this sub back.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:13:33
Bitcoin makes such a concept impossible. UBI requires consistent taxation and bitcoin (along with other cryptos) will shrink taxation down to voluntary levels.
Bitcoin makes most socialism impossible.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:53:55
Do some of you actually consider yourselves democratic socialists? And you’re buying bitcoin?! ��
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:18:23
�� i know
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:37:55
Economics doesn’t allow for this. Goods and services only come from demand. Who will supply robots who can only make a profit from the state.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:04:16
Economics is what led me to believe in bitcoin/crypto in the first place.
The statism in this sub scares me and i hope people will be able to use bitcoin as a reason to learn how scarce resources with alternative uses dictate how the world works.
**liberty is progress** not more government reliance.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:53:15
Look up basic economics. Scarce recourses which have alternative uses is not disappearing any time soon im sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:12:08
Read up on economics. The market only creates what the consumer demands.
The idea we will be “replaced” by robots is absurd.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:14:20
This sub has been overwhelmed by them
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:34:13
�� 
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:28:34
Putting the fact that the “automation” is an economic fallacy aside, I don’t want to live in a world where we are all completely reliant on a government (central power) that can be corrupted and turn against the people.
Also you don’t understand law. The human element will always exist. Imagine if OJ had hired a robot.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:15:16
And yes. I do have data, open a history book and look at every socialist and communist country ever.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:13:47
Are you retarded? Genuinely wondering. The extra thousand comes from who bought it. 
Im assuming you’re 12 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:04:17
For example?
 
Edit: how this benefits socialism is beyond me. It rips power from the state
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:30:37
Why do you think you only have 2 isp’s too choose from?
Government lobbying you think?
And you ask me to support making the government bigger? The internet doesn’t need regulation by the same organization censoring tv for the last 50 years.
If you honestly think one corporation can take over the internet, you miss understand what the internet is and the role the consumer plays in a free market.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:27:37
Its the strategy 99% of crypto users have been using, so i cant take credit. Almost no one is reporting this  and its sad this sub tells newbies to do so when they would be better off doing nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:21:57
Im curious now too. Will ledger come out with a new app if crome is discontinuing apps? I assume they would have they released anything about this?
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:26:12
Lol they don’t have computers
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:30:05
Internet, like bitcoin, doesn’t need a central party controlling it
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:31:47
Yeah, i just think people need to realize banking isn’t going anywhere, and the problem is government regulation not “greedy bankers”
Edit: bitcoin will stop the government from corruption. If the government wasn’t a puppet for the banks it wouldn’t happen
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:25:44
Everything you described is already at the state level for the most part.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:56:18
What are you doing in a bitcoin sub if you don’t understand how it destroys government power. Might want to read up because what you’re investing in might contradict your political views.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:22:25
Look up what a libertarian is. I believe in legal weed and am pro choice as well. But on the far right
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:50:13
It truly confuses me. How can you support Bernie sanders and say you  like bitcoin at the same time?
I guess they’re just poorly informed. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:54:30
Exactly so im asking why they support bitcoin when it conflicts with their left leaning political ideology
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:47:48
Elaborate 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:36:54
Are you actually this retarded?
Edit: genuine question, im not trying to be mean.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:25:27
I would argue much of the federal governments power comes from the fact they control the money. Taking that control from them forces them to play on our terms. Taking back the money takes back the power
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:37:28
Yeah and that redneck is wrong to call himself right
He should call himself a republican 
You need to learn what left and right actually mean and decide where you lie
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:56:07
In short, i believe taxation is theft.
If you understand economics you understand innovation comes from competition. Government is incapable of innovation, therefore I don’t want them the responsible party for my health care.
The only time government has innovated in recent years was during the space race. They were in competition with russia to get to space first. Almost no innovation has occurred in the space program since, hence our space shuttles still look like they did in the 1970’s. Flash forward to elon musk and space X and space ships look completely different and the technology is lightyears ahead because the private sector is taking control.
High prices in health care are due to government destroying competition and forcing employers to pay for insurance. When everyone is getting insurance from major corporations, hospitals can charge whatever they want as their customers are now multibillion dollar corporations, not individuals.
I want to see maximum innovation in healthcare, therefore a healthcare system paid for by the free market, not taxes. I believe in a health insurance system similar to car insurance. Maximum competition =low prices.
Taking money from another person against their will is always wrong no matter how “good” the cause is. 
These are just a few reasons. I and most other constitutional conservatives believe socalized healthcare is one of the scariest things that can happen in a society and will inevitably lead to tyranny.
**luckily, bitcoin and cryptos will make things like UBI and socialized healthcare a thing of the past. If you like socialism, you better stop liking bitcoin as one makes the other impossible**
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:16:39
They will do this regardless when btc starts to really threaten the dollar
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:18:41
Bitcoins mission is dumb? You should find a new thing you don’t think is dumb. Taxation is theft and bitcoin was meant to shrink it down to only bare necessity levels
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:27:47
Where did i say our society should have no taxes
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:46:43
What he anticipated made him go to extreme lengths to hide himself. So yes.
If he’s ever found (if alive) governments will have his head
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:37:38
Not necessarily. Private business is only supposed to work to profitability. They chase profit no matter what and you can’t blame them for that. 
When government gives them an opportunity to abuse the system through lobbying, of course they will.
Don’t be mad at them for doing what they naturally do (chase profit) be mad at government for enabling them to cheat. Don’t blame the player blame the game.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:47:30
No, court systems are a roll of government in the American constitution. Im a constitutionalist (aka librarian)
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:19:49
Lol. I wont. Fuck them.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:32:49
When something is taken from you against your will it is theft. What you are arguing is that it’s necessary theft.
To an extent i agree, however our current system of taxation and all the roles the federal government is taking on that they are not supposed to is immoral.  We spend most of our money on things other than roads and schools. With the amount of waste, we get almost nothing in return for whats being paid.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:45:15
Because it is political weather we want to admit it or not. I just can’t understand the bernie supporters who also like bitcoin. Its like they don’t get it
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:16:01
Im pissed i cant see litecoin now. Have to scroll
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:01:33
His source is coinbases official statement that it will begin at 9am
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:58:19
This is what i think too. Im worried they have inside information on futures
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:10:03
Right, so why do you like bitcoin if it will prevent things like socialized healthcare
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:03:16
Earned? Lol
All your hard work ��
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:43:55
I believe government will do everything in their power to stop crypto from taking power from them. They will fail because you cannot stop it. 
Places all over the world with suppressive governments will be liberated.
Government we conciser to be  “not” suppressing their people will have to shrink. They won’t be able to collect nearly as much tax revenue and people who don’t want to pay will be able to through things like monero. 
People will finally be liberated to do things like smoke weed and get abortions because government will be powerless to tell them not to.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:45:18
If you read closely i do NOT associate left and right with political parties.
I associate them with political ideology 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:40:21
If government was so small that “greedy bankers” were not able to manipulate it (how it should be in a truly free market) the bankers would be powerless.
You can’t blame them for chasing profit. Chasing profit is what private business is supposed to do.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:02:27
Im not saying I don’t want them here, im just confused as to why they want to be here
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:32:44
Also why were these “problems”not problems before net neutrality was made a thing a year ago? Why now? We’ve had the internet for decades now and all of the sudden it requires this regulation?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:48:22
Ok so why do you buy bitcoin when it threatens to take down governments
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:25:39
Lol i did take a class and thats where I learned about this scale
Anti capitalist-anarchists are confused
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:46:34
What does this have to do with my question. Why are people with ideology’s so opposite to bitcoin buying bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:08:00
Thats the thing, theres not. I was a huge liberal until I realized that.
Thats why libertarianism has grown so much since the internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:34:11
Lets make governments smaller so companies can’t use them to make regulations making them the only isps in and area? Huh.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:04:12
Somone should send this to FOX. They love shitting on other news networks especially NBC for fake news. You would also give them something to talk about.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:49:17
I agree. The only way they can “chase profit” without creating value is when the government enables them to do so. They’re always chasing profit, but without regulation they have to create value to do so
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:05:08
But... its not
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:11:29
If anyone knows how to get it to them speak up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:23:41
My frustration is all my friends buying bitcoin for the first time then trading it for ico shitcoins a week later. 
They don’t understand that they are investing in the idea of decentralized money and keep talking about “use cases” in things like ripple.
Some even push ico credit networks and some shit called sparklecoin
This is what happens when you buy into hype instead of the incredible thing that is decentralized money
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:47:10
You act like bitcoin just invented charity. We’ve been pumping money into Africa for years with little success. Im not saying don’t donate to those in need, just that pushing socialism in this sub wont get a good response as most “bitcoiners” are librarians.
You can’t advocate for universal basic income and bitcoin at the same time as they are opposites to each other. The great thing about bitcoin is that it finally gets us away from socialism.
Charity is great, reliance on handouts is not.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:30:52
Left just means pro government 
Right just means anti government
You might be more right than you think there pal if you want the government to get out of the way so weed can be legal
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:30:50
Nothing the federal government does with my money i think is right, so i guess im doing the right thing by keeping it out of their hands. Donate to a local charity, don’t give it to them.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:45:01
The whole idea behind bitcoin is we don’t need the governments regulation. Why would anyone here think net neutrality would be good for bitcoin or the internet for that matter.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:50:19
The only thing i think government should do is protect property rights. A free market can’t function without the protection of property rights. Its the ONLY thing they should do aside from maintaining a military to defend the free market from being attacked
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:10:01
But with things like monero, they won’t pay!
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:28:15
Exactly so fuck them and don’t report it
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:19:47
My dream is money in the hands of the people and not a government.
If I become better off financially as a side effect its just a bonus 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:52:54
If only we all could see this clearly 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:10:58
You sir are confused. Im talking about political ideology when i say left and right. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:12:20
Free markets have brought almost the entire free world today out of poverty. That kid in Africa is poor because of a lack of free markets, not a lack of socialism.
Bitcoin will liberate kids like that by bringing free markets to places like Africa and stripping socialist governments of their power. UBI is not a solution and you are misunderstanding bitcoin if you think socialism can exist in a world with bitcoin as the main currency.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:41:09
Due to lobbying, this is the reality of their technology. They barley have any recourses.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:14:53
And the better way is to take power from the state. I don’t understand how you differentiate the two. Satoshi didn’t 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:31:36
Hookers and blow
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:11:05
... but it does. Thats why satoshi is hiding. Bitcoin will rip power from the state if successful 
Edit: just because you don’t acknowledge the political message behind bitcoin doesn’t mean its not there
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:29:29
If you aren’t interested in politics you aren’t interested in bitcoin. They are connected 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:42:58
Thank you for describing what the government is saving me from.
GUYS look over here! The government is saving us from competition in isps! Weird I haven’t seen google fiber rip up my front yard. 
This is one of the dumbest arguments i have ever heard against competition. Technology advances past the need for cables. You can get internet many different ways including a satellite. 
Also, customers are demanding gig speed right now. Not throttling. Learn some economics so you can realize companies can’t just do whatever they want with their product and get away with it from a sales perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:52:44
One has a great effect on the other. Hard to socialize healthcare (or anything for that matter) when you can no longer force people to pay taxes
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:18:50
Its all a scale. The furthest right you can get is anarchy. The furthest left you can get is tyranny. Where you fall is up to you
I fall in line with the american constitution 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:29:13
Yes due too government lobbying. We should be making the government smaller, bot extending their regulatory reach.
The internet is a global network and doesn’t need to be regulated by a central party
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:14:32
If you find a man made 100 dollar bill it means somone loss it.
Are you really this unable to grasp basic economics?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:17:15
No i want justification of denouncing your ideology on the role of government over profit.
If you believe in socialism, you don’t believe in bitcoin. So why invest if you think it will fail
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:51:03
Protecting property rights is done through a court system 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:59:50
Y’all realize bitcoin will make UBI and other social programs impossible correct? You better start opposing crypto if you’re in favor of socialism as it will destroy the socialist movement.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:32:11
Yeah this is unfortunate. Had to stop using them.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:53:41
Don’t confuse libertarian with anarchism 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:06:29
Fuck bcash
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:23:57
It might with bitcoin
Edit: someone down-voted me for saying a libertarian president could be in the future because of bitcoin? 
This sub is lost man
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:19:57
Exactly. The people who don’t believe this and still buy bitcoin confuse me
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:59:41
Wearing mine right now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:36:23
Bitcoin has a huge political message. Good luck keeping politics out.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:37:59
Agreed. The argument im making is that we cannot stop business from being “greedy” but we can limit the government so it isn’t a tool for them to so. Without government they would have to act in a sustainable way
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:33:34
Lobbying would not happen if government was kept too small to offer private banks anything
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:37:05
And why did many cell phone companies have to stop doing that? 
Competition maybe?
Customers don’t want it, its not sustainable. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:51:08
You realize universal basic income is the opposite of what bitcoin is about right?
Socialism requires a central party and bitcoin is designed to kill centralization.
I like bitcoin because it makes things like UBI, socialized health care, and other forms of socialism impossible. It will bring us to an entirely free market system.
I would learn a bit about what bitcoin will do before jumping to these assumptions. Its the most libertarian/conservative idea ever.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:51:15
What? Im saying we need to change the system back to what our founding fathers intended
“Thats great but its not reality so its stupid”
You’re a real visionary.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:29:00
You need to educate yourself. Weed is illegal because of the government. I believe we should shrink the government to legalize weed. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:52:07
This happened with segwit. It takes everyone to adopt it. Hassle coinbase and others to adopt it
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:36:07
Government dependence is exactly what satoshi wanted rid of. People need to read his writings.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:17:26

@_date: 2017-12-24 02:23:26
This is starting to piss me off. I HATE bcash, but it’s getting really difficult to defend this bullshit. We need lighting NOW.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:29:41
Our current tax system is immoral. Not advocating for a tax less society 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:54:42
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:04:54
Not necessarily, but it has a very anti government message and im confused why left leaning people are getting into it
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:27:56
Good pro 2nd amendment argument i guess.
Edit: learn how a decentralized ledger works. They can claim control over it, but never actually take control. Bitcoin is like air, a government might say they own the air but they can’t stop anyone from breathing it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:55:09
Shit like this is the complete opposite of what decentralization is about. Moderate, don’t be a tyrant.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:58:08
They’ve managed to get that shit up to 600 again. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:07:01
Because gold is so easy and cost efficient to produce. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:59:43
You already do. Learn a the difference between a tax and a private transaction between one party and another for a service.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:46:43
Thank you ��
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:52:59
Bitcoin will stop horrible things like universal basic income.

Socialized free bitcoin education modeled after Venezuela?  Sounds like a solid plan.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:49:10
Without decentralization, “blockchain” is just a database.
Databases have been around for thousands of years. These people are idiots who try to separate “blockchain” from the decentralized assets its tied too.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:56:48
Bitcoin was created to take back control of the money preventing these crashes.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:41:45
To some extent i agree, however i know of a few people with these “certifications” who have jobs, but are stuck in their position being quickly passed by those coming into the industry with a degree. Most of these cases are in the banking industry though, which demands degrees to maintain upward mobility.
As someone wanting to be a stock broker, I doubt ill get very far with just a certificate.
However i fear a shrinking banking industry could make my career choice more competitive and lower paying pushing me into another sector. 
We’ll just have to wait and see i guess. Sure you may be able to acquire many finance skills with a certificate, but that doesn’t mean you will be marketable to employers in high level positions.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:39:26
If that were true there would be no need for free markets. Capitalism works because it allows for incentives
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:38:47
Pretty broad term, but i think you’d be surprised.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:58:33
Best answer so far thanks. Does this suggest that there is a need for alts just to have something to leverage and compare btc against
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:44:12
Last thing id invest in is government.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:52:33
Im talking about incentive to invest money. If the value of my money is growing faster than say the housing market, why would i buy a house. 
You said wants and needs are incentives, but needing a house isn’t going to make me invest in the housing market,  i could just rent. 
People want and need things all over the world but only when the incentive of making money do they invest or innovate.  Thats why south korea looks like new york and north korea is a shit whole. Free markets.
Edit: also the evil dictator

Btc could easily fall to sub 5000 level before going up. You could lose more than 10 dollars before rent is due.

People have needs and desires all over the world. Only in places with free markets do you see innovation. Innovation stems from incentive. 
I need a house, but i could just rent one.

Wow, big change.
Im definitely getting concerned about the future of the banking industry myself.
Of course there are jobs for finance within private businesses and outside of the banking industry, but wonder how it will effect the sector.
Fear i may be walking into a dying industry.

But while this is happening their product is becomeming worth less. And if they had to borrow why would anyone lend to them?
