It is a scenario where a block chain is split into 2. Consider a following leyman example.. BU thinks that a train's capacity can be increased by adding more bogies, doing so will increase the capacity but with some trade-off. Core's way of scaling is analogical to a smart way of rearranging seats in a bogie to add more capacity.

No Gaurav, the fact that bitcoin is not going mainstream is fear of it's fork(small % who understand Bitcoin technology), not scalability. This is keeping more people off of it. But anyway,  the fud is a good publicity. Another point is that there are too many scams coming up in India which i fear once people realize, they get repelled more. Let's not expect bitcoin to become a get rich quick currency, I think it is doing just fine.

Evolution has shown us that central planners failed to run an economy. Decentralised system will stagnate to develop quickly but it is an intrinsic property to protect itself. If looking from a non authoritarian pov, the decentralised system is attractive and is preferred way to do economy. bitcoins value has no ceiling and only time can show us what will it be.

You already got my point, writing cheque was clearly ur secondary option.. why was that? It was because of all the hassles merchant(or u) must go through.

Well that is a mystery. A wait and watch approach needs to be applied. AFAIK, bitcoin is a digital asset that behaves in a complementary way to fiat currencies. If Bitcoin's underlying tech remains strong and unbreakable, we will see it's value only going up. Bitcoin has it's value because it provides super underground vault like security @ your finger tips and an easy transaction facility without any hassles(unlike gold transportation)

Because bitcoin is severely undervalued and we community think people will come to senses once they are pressurised by activities like demonetization, inflation etc.. Bitcoin is inherently sensorship resistant and limited in supply with demand highly increasing and it's behaviour as a safe store of value(I'd prefer even though it's price fluctuates and am proud that I've an entry on a digital real estate - THE blockchain), feels like a safest asset I can own.

Forget bitcoin ATMs in India! There are only couple of apps where you can buy with you bank account. FYI, the current prices are very high. Im not sure if people use localbitcoins here.
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:08:24
True, although suggesting that other may have it.

What does the community think about Bitcoin's use case of synthetic stocks that's launched by Abra recently?
@_date: 2017-04-15 04:19:17
This is quite amazing, never thought of it before..

This is actually a good idea!
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:10:02
Ok AFAI understand now, they will still be able to mine after segwit activates unless there is a fix.
@_date: 2017-04-01 08:25:44
Does this really happen?
@_date: 2019-04-17 07:49:34
IKR! We have a very tough job to explain what truly the Bitcoin is. I was just concerned about the 25M subscribers.
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:02:44
Then why is bitmain blocking segwit if they will be able to still mine nonsegwit transactions?  Will it be that non segwit tx will not be there at all in the network?
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:01:19
You can also add ledger nano s account into mycelium just to monitor it.
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:54:00
Trust me, I work with an asic design company(mobile processors, not miners) and it is really difficult to reverse engineer a chip unless they have a dedicated io to enable asicboost mode. Else there must be an x-ray photography of the chip to reverse engineer its physical layout to functional gates. They may also have a custom state machine implemented/security protocol to stay covert. Very difficult IMO. Would like to hear more from u/nullc about this.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:34:05
Cool! Care to mention some drawbacks u state?
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:17:33
Does ledger nano s support multisig?
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:47:19
Does this affect the existing paper and hardware wallets?

@_date: 2017-04-09 16:24:33
Correct, as a business it would be bad, but as a user I'm pissed off by the stagnation of network efficiency upgrades. They seems to support linear block size increase which is again only a short term solution.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:55:29
Another point to be noted is that bitmain's medium post  points out that other asic manufacturers may also have it enabled.
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:28:12
Foxconn has a great opportunity here IMO

They stay in ledger. U are safe.
@_date: 2017-04-09 15:46:45
What progress are you referring to? The centralized and convert way of running asicboost?
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:54:20
There was another post discussing that even though segwit activates, miners can mine non segwit blocks with asicboost on.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:52:08
I have not seen any issues by doing it.. Your account will still be safe in mycelium on ur phone as it requires ur nano s for spending. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:17:24
Isn't the point of HF to create a split and 2 blockchains? U want an average Joe going nuts when he hear what BTU n BTC are? 
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:10:18
What's wrong in announcing that they have deployed a patented tech that they have started using on the network which reduces their cost by 30%? Oh wait, they did it covertly coz they are afraid that others might catch up?, oh wait.. does bitmain have their patent approved or is still pending? Oh wait is it China where they have applied the patent in? Awesome.. bravo.. slow claps.. why block the tech improvements on the network? Oh yes AB is incompatible with segwit... Now I see where it is going.. short term profits are more important..

@_date: 2017-04-08 16:58:24
I was under the impression that bip148 activates segwit and implicitly blocks asicboost ability. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:03:49
3rd paragraph suggests that like other manufacturer bitmain also has circuit that support AB
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:05:15
So what's ur point? Is there something wrong with a secondary layer being enabled? Do u have any other innovative ideas to not have my coffee tx bloating the blockchain?

My preference would be trezor(open-source) and then ledger nano s or nano X.  you can now pair them with blockstream green wallet app or mycelium on android or use their respective brand wallets.
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:15:37
It'll be cool if u can share the designs so that we can get it printed
@_date: 2017-04-09 15:59:04
It seems that AB was being used cowardly without anyone knowing about it and was denied being used on mainnet. This is not a fair competition IMO. That being one thing, as a user I want to use the technical advantage of segwit, it seems to me the miners will be an idiot if they don't activate it. It will stall the price and prevent lightning microtransactions!
@_date: 2017-04-04 14:28:26
Did u see the video?
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:04:42
Nice, Bitcoin is teaching me a lot more.. first the concept of ideal money, a Little bit of coding, then how traders think, then the politcs(fight between bu n segwit). A niche domain where u seldom get to learn all of these :)

I guess u/slush0 has already stated that bitmain may have been using asicboost. Other pools must come forward and express their views.

I think paper wallets are sufficient with BIP38 password encryption.. make different paper wallets for 0.25 bitcoins each if ur a hodler. U can sweep them when required as many online wallets support bip38. Not so expert in this area but may be someone can justify here.

Hi, I don't really understand why people say not to use blockchain.info wallet.. infact the bitcoin wiki page or linkedin profile of satoshi says that he is the creator of blockchain.info. so far I haven't seen any issues with my funds and ofcourse it's better to have a paper wallet created from bit address.org and add large funds on it... Is the person who created trust less network not trustable enough..?

I totally agree that it's a shit but don't u think it'll help build bitcoin economy? Let's say that banks merge the existing fiat accounts with equivalent amount of bitcoin, where they charge a small amount for transactions.. im okay with it... If they give an easy option to exchange fiat to bitcoin we can easily use them to onboard people into crypto economy... Ofcourse at the end of day.. "hold the private keys by yourself"

Why Andreas antonopolous does not participate in scaling conferences? was hoping to see him :(
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:31:14
So you mean to say you want to add value by making it scarce over the time on the already existing planned scare supply of bitcoins? You can also think in this perspective, there are lot of treasures with gold dumped by pirates n kings but that simply creates more scarcity than the once available on earth which is already scarce. Do you want economy to be based on unknown circulation of bitcoins or known? Think which one is good to create a better economy rather than we worrying only on the short term price of bitcoins.. just my views :)
@_date: 2016-10-29 18:53:09
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:04:18
I'm not taking your bitcoins but rather making it recirculate if it is hodled in a same address for a really long time, may happen because you have lost ur private key. Returning the bitcoins to the network if not utilised. In this way, the inflation rate is readjusted based on the number of bitcoins lost and network stays healthy and transparent.
@_date: 2016-10-22 13:24:10
There are wealthy people who thinks bitcoin is ponzy scheme.. so I think it's the well informed/educated and the ones who can invest wisely will be the elites.

By experiment, I mean allow to implement changes that are potentially dangerous but necessary..
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:20:01
I want to understand what the priority of this community is.. ie adding properties to the network which will serve as a better one in the future or fearing the hardfork which will crash the existing economy.. I assume Bitcoin is still a 10billion dolar experiment..

I agree this might heavily affect the social contract, but don't you think it can keep the bitcoin economy stable over the years based on the fixed supply rate?

WhaTs d point in converting fiat to btc then the seller again converts back to fiat.. v need a better solution and sellers directly accepting bitcoin and creating a self sustainable economy.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:13:56
Damn, I guarantee that if I would have mined back then, I would be too lazy enough to sell bitcoins unless I really was desperate to buy something. Being lazy would have been worth it. All that matters was luck my friend.

You must consider buying it. However small amount it is. Yolo and HODL.
@_date: 2016-10-06 07:07:19
I believe the prediction is based on utility. MU2 would probably change the way artists share their songs, movies etc. Imagine a large set of people paying them in microtransactions and is borderless. Not sure how much MU2 will take a cut, but is a good application.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:57:55
I'd rather HODL my bitcoins than pay :P but that's just an illusion. It's utility is to transact which is how is value is derived

PoW or PoS is a way to secure the blockchain. What does that has to to with value of it's token? Value depends on the total supply, demand and it's utility(there's none AFAIK).
@_date: 2016-10-23 17:22:33

Who the fuck trades ripple? I thought it was a closed source crypto!
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:36:53
Ethereum is not a cryptocurrency, it is a platform for a decentralised application execution. Ether the tokens are fuel used by the apps for execution. Ether holds value because people hold them and is traded and its sole purpose is not the store of value nor value exchange. Bitcoin is a decentralised peer to peer money. You decide what % u wanna put to what. I would go 80% BTC n 10% ether n 10% alts.
I also think ether is not capped to supply limit as per the posts I have read. Note that I do not have any investment in ether.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:39:32

Invest in Bitcoin, take the profits from the gain n then buy asic miner from it. In this way, ul not regret buying a miner and also help protect the network.
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:26:33
I get it.. consensus rules are the most difficult ones to implement changes as it requires majority agreement..
@_date: 2017-05-04 09:48:28
Just use coinbase account to buy, once u have bitcoins in ur wallet, immediately move it to a hardware wallet if u r buying more. So I recommend u to buy a hardware wallet which is safe from malware and hacks.

It is not the data you use, rather it is the data that needs to be put into the blockchain to make your transaction. Read above comments on the same.

Atleast historically it looked good.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:37:15
I smell an attempt by some rogue miners to spike their profits for a short term knowing that there's lot of competition in real Bitcoin network..
@_date: 2017-07-09 09:55:01
I still don't quite get why bitmain signed NYA even though there's a mandatory segwit activation scheduled along with 2mb base block size increase. Is asicboost compatible with NYA or am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:08:02
In that case, 1 Satoshi or equivalent to a dollar will never be worth it to make a transaction on chain :(
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:50:56
Because it exists only in matrix Neo.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:50:53
"The purpose of my email is to try and assist in the "immediate activation of segwit" which only requires hashrate to participate; and to provide some techincal input since I have done a great deal of research and development into the topic." I like this attitude.
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:25:41
Yes bhai it will. Give it some time to go over all the shit in Aug. I'm mega bullish.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:26:47
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:05:01
So do we treat asicboost as a bug in the protocol or a feature? If a bug, is there a proposal to fix it or will be allowed on non segwit blocks?
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:13:22
I want to understand how it works and how it impacts the price when it starts.

Your transaction size is larger than usual. Let me give u analogy to support my statement. Imagine u have a piece of gold let's say 1kg and u want to transfer it to a different place which is 10km away. So u will carry the gold and travel by your car which will cost you on the fuel. Now let's say you have bits and pieces of gold deposited at different places and you have to pick it up from there then finally collect all and transfer.. this will cost you more fuel hence more cost.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:03:03
The best and least realisation of a behaviour​al model depends on what gate level synthesis tool a designer uses. It highly varies what other peripherals the asic has. AFAIK, sha256 standalone is a very small design n probably has some 50k gates(pulling out of my ass).

Let's say I have a 24 letter seed and have coins in them. 1. Is it possible to add a 25th letter to the same seed for security? 2. Will plausible deniability pin generates and boot into a completely different seed so that I do not disclose my actual account? Sorry if this question is a kind of dumb.
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:17:33
I believe only an exit to fiat trigger capital gains tax. The products you buy using voucher already charges consumer tax.
