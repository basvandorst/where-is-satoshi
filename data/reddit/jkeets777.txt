Ive been to Greece, have you? The ones who work, work 5 hour days, take midday naps and go out all night drinking. And since getting fired from your job takes extreme effort, they all dont seem to care at all about work.&gt;  same as the US budget debate. Both sides are playing hardball but in the end a compromise agreement will be made in the last minute. And the same process is repeated in a few

Well if he didn't seem nice, charming and honest who would trust him with all that money? Its par for the course.

Proof? No, but you don't need to look far to get a good idea into this guys character.  His past is extremly sketchy and shows him as the head director and/or founder of several companies that were dissolved for tax reasons.  He is also the creator of "ScrollQuest", a "real life treasure hunt game".  ScrollQuest has a reputation of horrendous customer service, failure to pay out prizes among other complaints.  Also, the guy just openly admitted to auto insurance fraud.  Not the type of person I would trust to handle a charity.  Ask him for receipts and see what excuse he digs up.

Here's a great visualization of how tiny bitcoins market cap is to, say, gold.
Note that Bitcoin is now ~3 times the size as it was at the time this was made

A lot of people here believe Bitcoin has the potential to be used similar to gold as a substitute for gold or silver as a store of value.  Bitcoin has many of the same characteristics; fixed supply, liquid (can be sold very easily, is decentralized and outside the countrol of banks and governments.  Bitcoin has a few advantages over gold: infinitly divisible (gold is very hard to break into smaller units), transfer almost instantly anywhere in the world,  can store it on a piece of paper or literally in a phrase you can memorize (makes it very easy to cross borders with and conceal vast amounts of wealth, there are others as well.
Do I think it will replace gold anytime soon? No. But I deffinetly think what I listed above justifies it being worth at least 1%-2% of golds total value - and even that would but it somewhere in the $50-$100 K per coin.
Is it possible an event will happen and people will lose confidence and the price will again crash? yes.  But the more the total market cap grows the less volatile the day-to-day price change will become.  That and it's clearly the only crypto with a clear network advantage and established value and momentum.

ELI5 What does this mean for people who hold BTC on a TREZOR or something?  This only affects miners no?
