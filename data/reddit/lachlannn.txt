Man if i was you id put those coins into cold storage asap. Go get a couple flash drives and save the .wallet on them. 
If you have a printer, print out a paper wallet.
This way they can only get your coins if they get access to those flash drives or paper wallet.

Picture and id scan are only used to set up your account when first using atm, second time vein scan is used as a kind of non intrusive form of identification as its not used for anything else and is therefore worthless. This is a form of 2 factor authentication to protect your account .. I think, correct me please people 
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:31:01
Hey there, do you have access to a printer? If so a paper wallet is one of the safest ways to store coins.  
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:32:19
This also includes people transferring to another wallet they own. But hey more activity, no matter where it's coming from is good - it tests the infrastructure and at the same time shows bitcoins potential yano

@_date: 2014-01-04 07:45:33
Should we really be faking a bitcoin market to potential companies?
If they do go ahead and start accepting and no one who actually purchases their products uses btc.. couldnt this create a negative reaction from companies as they could potentially feel they have been conned into using btc as indeed a promotional tool 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:40:52
Don't worry man they're just bandwagoning, it's good exposure for cypto currencies so who cares 
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:22:16
Am I the only one who doesn't care to use bitcoin completely anonymously ?

Wouldn't it already cost PayPal nothing to transfer funds internationally PayPal user to PayPal user? Considering the PayPal 'dollar' is just a number 
Say I want to transfer $100 from my PayPal account to yours, PayPal would simply -100 from my account then +100 onto your account costing them absolutely nothing? It's not like they have separate bank accounts for each PayPal user 
 
I think with bitcoin paypal could potentially allow payment via bitcoin to sellers who don't accept PayPal but accept btc allowing them to expand their market reach 
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:08:00
Well TIL, thanks 
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:30:22
At least they were honest and apologetic about it.. shit they even credited you.

Yeah get yourself a car 
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:35:30
It will happen...
I think right now it's a waiting game, once coinbase and bitpay get a stronger foundation and larger workforce and their company profiles becomes less startup-ish? And with the lastest investments into both we should see that this year.. I hope but shit I know fuck all

Sell half and go have fun man 
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:57:32
Why not allow both? 
I think Bitcoin is going to become massively popular to the younger gens, having to use an ID restricts potential customer base

Not many people buy more than $300 worth at any given time, in saying this I'd much rather go to a shop to purchase coins than some random I've met on the net.. Even if I had to pay slightly more
And if you're buying more than 300 worth you'd think you would be on an exchange anyway to get them even cheaper than local
Edit; just re-read didn't realise you said bank transfer through local, I can see your reasoning now. Though In aus it can take up to 48 hours to send cash through my bank to someone else.. Is it instant in the uk? 
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:48:38
Hey is this the same for electrum? I'm hesitant switching from multibit to electrum as the amount of address it goes through frightens me.
Oh and can someone explain to me the function/need of dumping the remaining btc when a transation is made into a 'change' wallet? 
I'm a fucking noob

Dude do not buy now! It will drop down below current price in a couple weeks. we're in a bubble

Im just having a troll.. I hold both but the fact bitcoin costs me $2-$4 each transaction is telling that its on its way out 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:52:39
So I should buy Bitcoin Cash instead? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:40:53
So I should buy some bch?

Why is it trash? Isn’t it exactly the same as 2013-2016 bitcoin but with larger blocks? I don’t want to try this new segwit thing it’s only produced higher fees I can’t even justify using btc to pay for my VPN anymore because the fees are like 20% of the monthly cost of the damn subscription 
@_date: 2015-11-04 11:36:13
I was just wondering the same thing. If I remember correctly they were a bit shady - they could be artificially lowering the price to deter fiat withdrawals on their platform.. Dunno 
@_date: 2015-10-23 11:22:27
Bitcoin ATM dude, google it there's a couple in melbourne.
You're better off using localbitcoins and paying cash so you'd have to meet up with them so find a reputable seller 
@_date: 2015-11-04 11:41:36
Try localbitcoins - find someone reputable

How well do you think technical analysis did before the sr takedown? 
You cannot predict these types of crashes along with potential crashes from negative media attention, whales mass dumping and unknown glitches yet to be discovered. These all can massively effect btc price and there is no way looking at graphs you can predict that. 
Bitcoins a ride, just go along with it

When gold was first used as a form of currency thousands of years ago, what extrinsic value did it hold then? other than being pretty? 
Man found an extrinsic value/use for gold over time .. jewelry .. electronics. but first it was used as a means for trade. It has value because of its means for trade. 
Bitcoin has value because it is used as a means for trade. 
No one can create gold at will, the same applies to bitcoin. How hard is it to see bitcoins value?
TL;DR Currency doesn't need to have extrinsic/intrinsic (whatever) value! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:25:14
Im 19. Growing up I could never understand the concept of fiat currency, someone having the power to print at will seems so wrong. 
Bitcoin seems so right for so many different reasons. I can store the private key on a USB which no one else can access. I can send it almost instantly to anyone around the world and no one can create bitcoin at will.
The fact that fiat currency deprecates due to inflation over time is a major flaw in the whole system and seems completely backwards to the way it's "suppose" to be. Not even term deposits can keep up with inflation.
Every single one of my peers who I've discussed this with agree, and thus bought btc AGAINST my advise.  
No one but yourself should be in control of your money, your life. That's why I jumped aboard the bitcoin boat ... 
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:50:01
Yeah I don't think the bitcoin crowd are the type to sport a wristband .. Does anyone even wear them anyway :s 
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:03:58
Only a fool would take financial advice from someone over the internet, read up and decide upon yourself if you're going to be sinking 4k into bitcoin as an investment.

Did he link you to blockchain? 
Did you open anything he sent you like photos, PDFs, word docs etc? 
When he gave you his login details for blockchain was user/pass in clear text? Or did you click a link to blockchain and the account was already logged in? 
In future please stick to trusted exchanges/local bitcoins, and never ever communicate with anyone for what ever reason through email. 
I hate reading stuff like this :( 
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:44:30
Seriously I don't find exchanges are any harder to set up/use than PayPal. 
If they can manage to link a bank account to PayPal then setting up an account on an exchange should be a walk in the park..
Soon enough you'll be able to buy btc in brick and mortar stores and this won't even be a problem. Here we come future you fuck
