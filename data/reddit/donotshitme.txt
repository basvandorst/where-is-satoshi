the 1mb block size was put in by Satoshi with the provision that it was an anti spam measure to be removed for scaling of the network. there are quotes on this.
Maybe Gavin wasn't the best person to give the keys to, but *the block size debate is absolutely ridiculous*. There is absolutely no logical reason why we can't increase from 1mb to 20mb and continue the same discussions we're having today

but a possible increase in blocksize isn't going to decrease the total number of full nodes. already it's ridiculously cheap to control 80% of all full nodes, but it's not a concern because it's unrealistic.  
I seriously doubt censorship is a realistic issue with small 20 mb blocks.

I'm glad we agree inflation won't keep miners running forever. we agree that is a problem that needs to be solved. Now please explain, in detail, how keeping 1mb blocks instead of increasing the block size will allow for that to happen. Keep in mind that miners can enforce their own soft cap of 300kb, 700kb, 1mb, 5mb, 15mb, etc. blocks if they want to. Also keep in mind that miners don't have to include 0 fee transactions if they don't want to. Also keep in mind that if transactions cost money, miners will want to process as many as possible, so that they can maximize their profits.
over time, inflation will trend toward 0, you are correct. As miners make tough decisions on whether or not it's worth it to keep running,  either fees will cover it or the bitcoin experiment will fail. FORTUNATELY we have 100+ years before that becomes a problem and fee markets can be programmed in.  
For now, we need to solve block scarcity or else the bitcoin network will forever be destined to be the bank's method of reconcilation, not the people's ledger.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:46:18
You, like, so clearly just don't get it, man.
if I have an old address that isn't used anymore but my wallet client still recognizes it as my address, and it gets sent .001 btc, suddenly I think I have .001 more btc in my account. let's say I spend my 1.001 btc from an untainted coinbase transaction - it's unlinked to any one person besides the miner (who decided to stay anonymous). 
Now, the old address with an output of .001 and the untainted 1 btc is linked. it is now highly likely that the previously anonymous coins are now linked with my old wallet that had .001 btc sent to it.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:30:42
Most people already pay a minimal fee for transactions.  And miners can create their own artificial scarcity if necessary. 20mb blocks is still incredibly scarce in a mass adoption scenario. fees can be implemented in other ways than block scarcity. 
right now the pow network is increasing at an exponential rate. there's no reason to anticipate any other scenario for as long as the block reward remains large enough to encourage new investment in mining. so your "x years" comment is just to encourage fud.
You're talking about creating fee markets far sooner than me so "once we figure out how they actually work" is an argument against you,  not me.
you don't know that low transaction fees are not sustainable.... why not? xx mb blocks with 50000 transactions @ .0004 btc/transaction is 20 BTC per block.
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:58:02

so bitcoin is used by, what,  a maximum of 20 million people?  that's .28% of the total worlds population. Bitcoin is still bootstrapping. Increasing from 1mb to 20mb is part of that bootstrapping. We can't handle current adoption rates with the current setup, why on earth aren't we looking forward to possible massive increases?
If it doesn't happen, no worries, blocks stay small and miners stay subsidized for another *100 years...*

" Even a single-line change such as increasing the maximum block size has effects on other parts of the code, some of which are undesirable. For example, right now it’s possible to construct a transaction that takes up almost 1MB of space and which takes 30 seconds or more to validate on a modern computer (blocks containing such transactions have been mined). In 2MB blocks, a 2MB transaction can be constructed that may take over 10 minutes to validate which opens up dangerous denial-of-service attack vectors. Other lines of code would need to be changed to prevent these problems."

@_date: 2015-08-24 06:21:56


in a debt-based currency you have to have people constantly spending money for the economy to succeed. it's based on constant permanent growth,  which is an unreal expectation. With Bitcoin, I simply will not accept that someone would rather keep it in case it would be more valuable the next day if they were hungry and the only way they could eat was to spend their bits.
If you accept that people will spend their money when they need to with Bitcoin, then you'd also expect the quality of goods to go up in a bitcoin based economy. no one wants to spend their bitcoin that will go up on a piece of technology that will be obsolete in 2 years, or a toy with planned obsolescence. 
no issue here, just the effects of a sound money.

$20 transaction fees does not make Bitcoin unviable as a global ledger. It just means that people are willing to pay $20 at a consistent rate to have their settlement recorded in the bitcoin blockchain. Is Bitcoin a "payment processor"? I guess that's up for debate. I'd probably argue that payment processors are a very specific type of business that bitcoin isn't very well suited for (see BitPay "pivoting" it's business model away from this).
[insert function]. Bitcoin being the first p2p distributed ledger backed by strong cryptography isn't enough for you?  You need to add PoS? how about a 210m coin limit because 21m isn't enough for bitcoin as a globally adopted ledger, payment system, [insert function]. You think people are suddenly going to start using bitcoin because you inflated it?

how long did you stay?  how much money did you make?  how many customers did you have?  did the app work 100% of the time issue free?  did anyone have a problem with the fact that they could only buy in increments of $25? did anyone wait around long enough to buy more than one $25? did you have change for people who didn't have exactly $22.5? how many people actually even carry cash with them anymore? I'd rather just use my cc and get 3% back at the end of the month plus in-app Starbucks rewards.

I'll offer you one last piece of advice, shitstain, if you go on a BTC hardfork, regardless of which scammer proposes it, you will lose your bitcoins.

can you pay your bills in btc at the terminal? 
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:12:34
1kb/transaction... unrealistic
$6500/year in bandwidth costs to run a full node based on those projections.... unrealistic
Maybe Satoshi had a good vision and Bitcoin will scale to the same number of transactions as Visa, but they won't be transactions of the same nature.  do you really need your morning coffee purchase recorded in an immutable ledger for the rest of time?
@_date: 2015-04-21 05:39:45
How is this done? Just using Bitpay to convert bitcoin into AUD and pay the company for you?  How much does it cost to use this service? What would the advantage be to paying the bill yourself? 
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:26:55
Late comment so this probably won't be read. I'm just shocked at how fucking imbecile some of you are. Thinking that blockstream - a company full of btc devs - has more interest in crippling bitcoin than the institutional money of venture capitalists


what the actual fuck?
@_date: 2015-09-16 12:42:16
8GB just means that bitcoin is inflated beyond recognition and it would be unfeasible for most users to run a full node
@_date: 2015-09-04 12:17:11
Minimum fees really seems to keep the spam off the network right now...
The spam isn't the deal breaker. Inflating bitcoin to the tune of hundreds of terabytes in the next few years is the deal breaker.

exactly. if you go on the bitcoin hardfork,  regardless of which scammer proposes it, you will lose your bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:26:57
there are people that take on negative capital expense currently because they believe that bitcoin's price will increase in the future. They even continue to run their old ASICs after they pay more in power than they make in BTC, simply because of belief. In a bitcoin future risk will be significantly mitigated, so will mining profits. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 15:59:49
8GB isn't enough for entrenched institutions to get their grubby hands all over a peer to peer ledger. So let's stop worrying about what the NSA, *cough*, Fidelity, wants
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:39:00
I don't support BIP101
Well I believe people should be able to use Bitcoin without paying thousands of dollars on digital storage. Decentralization should be and remain the primary factor of the protocol. You, and it seems Gavin, have been tricked by the same multinational conglomerates that have tricked the plebs for eons. Circle is backed by Goldman Sachs. Yet I only see people mentioning blockstream (how bitcoin was always talked about scaling - through sidechains) conflicts of interest.  How about the traditional banking system that bitcoin is trying to subvert? 
They have a lot more to lose than Blockstream does.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:41:52
Yes, so let's even further increase the costs to miners by making them pay thousands of dollars to run a full node.
@_date: 2015-09-15 05:43:53
trying to change bitcoin into a payment network is completely different than neutering. bitcoin works as intended.  transactions take up physical space, which costs money. 
 a secure and immutable ledger that will last until the end of time doesn't need your shitty fucking morning coffee transaction on it.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:21:17
I don't understand how creating a new regulation and license as opposed to just applying current regulations could be good for anyone but the regulator's pocketbook.  It's so clearly an example of the corrupt system that Bitcoin is trying to upend. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:10:39
bitcoin as an exchange of value is inherently political.  It exists as a currency, protocol, store of value and a distributed ledger without the approval of any formal body. (aka: government).
Give me a scenario in which bitcoin is used by a majority of people and is regulated by governments. Please.
@_date: 2015-09-04 12:16:08
So in 2036 when the blockchain reaches 200 TB+ you're certain my hard disk will hold it?
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:07:57
It's more like Xapo, which has funding from Goldman SACHS and Fidelity,  want to create huge physical memory and bandwidth costs to run a full node.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:42:59

ok, fair, I appreciate your level-headed arguments and I can concede that in 20 years it's a possibility that there will be enough people with 1 Gbps that there will be enough full nodes.
I still take issue with your assumption that $/GB will continue to decrease exponentially 
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:45:20

no one said it's already happening. it's not far fetched at all to imagine that governments that refuse to accept the existence of bitcoin will have a lot of trouble maintaining the current structures in place.  Your opinion is clearly that bitcoin will not replace government currency, which I'm glad you have that opinion,  if people didn't believe in the current system, life would be chaos.
unfortunately I think governments are about to collapse under their own weight / new wars will begin, without the help of bitcoin, bitcoin will just catalyze the process

So you only read the first and last sentence of my comment and then responded with a wall of text? I very clearly specified that I don't like your estimate of .04/kwh because it's *too high*.  Not because it's *too low*.
 it's probably closer in the realm of .02-.025 on average.
which brings the total cost of running the network down quite a bit in your calculations.
which makes your educated guesses/estimates sort of... off

why does blocksize have anything to do with it

@_date: 2015-10-03 01:47:54
I'm not sure I like your estimate of $.04/kwh
I think you got a 70x increase instead of a 10x increase based on the assumption that power is more expensive and mining does not become more efficient. Mining will become more efficient,   which you said as well. I think 1, 2, or 8 MB blocks in the short term, and 32 MB if it becomes used by 3+billion people

@_date: 2015-11-10 02:35:57
centralization of mining seems to be a big weakness in this system, as well as the possibility for the network to invalidate past transactions. I think a major part of bitcoin is the push feature... no chargebacks.
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:55:12
yes it's magnitudes more secure than a private blockchain. by definition a private chain would be centralized and very likely vulnerable to a malicious 3rd party.  the whOle point of bitcoin is that it's distributed and decentralized

because we're making money trading. Cryptsy has had "warning signs flashing" since it's inception but it managed to stick around longer than any of the other big 2014 alt exchanges. 
WE KNOW that when we leave money on cryptsy that they're in control of it. that's part of the system of making money trading. you take that risk.

@_date: 2015-02-08 17:15:06
Making mainchain transactions won't be necessary for the large majority of users, that's why it's ok that it costs so much to use the network now. (the bitcoin network is very expensive,  the block reward currently subsidizes the cost)
@_date: 2015-02-10 02:40:41
Also, how exactly do you do an off chain transaction.... With a trusted third party? Might as well use a bank since it's backed by the government.  
Gavin, you're clearly on the team of "increased centralization". That's why so many people feel intrinsically resistant to your ideas, even if they agree with your apparent logic.
