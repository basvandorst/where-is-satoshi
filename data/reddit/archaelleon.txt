Well the UFC does its fair share of international shows. I thought it was fairly recognized worldwide.

What he said was a little hyperbolic, yes. But what you're seeing is the government tightening their grip on you. Are they going to come to your house and drag you from your home? No, probably not.
However, if they keep squeezing, little by little, one day you might feel trapped and have no way to fight back.
It sounds ridiculous in this day and age, sure. But the powerful will always take as much as they can. Guns at least make them take notice when we tell them to back the fuck off.

Have you seen what's been happening lately? Corporations buying out our government officials? Militarization of our police force?
Fear of our government isn't irrational.

The the roof? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This is my first crash and I'm still not concerned because I wasn't delusional about short-term profits when I invested.

That's what I was thinking, this crash should be a good way to burn off all the fairweather fans and, in the end, result in a more stable currency. 
A lot of pump-and-dumpers are getting burned, and hopefully they won't come back.

Even if it crashes down to $1, I don't care. Sure, I'd be bummed, but hey, at least I gave it a shot. I'm not out anything other than some disposable income, and I write that off as the price of taking a chance, like feeding quarters into a slot machine.
People who put their life savings into bitcoin at $1200 because they thought "To the moon!" are losing their minds now. Good.
Let the crash burn off all of these fairweather fans. If you can't handle some minor tribulations the bitcoin community is better off without you.

I see a lot of people in this sub trying to scare people out of bitcoin and attempting to convince them to go to dogecoin instead.

Not only that, but I'm seeing a lot of sensible, level-headed posts getting downvoted. And I'm not talking delusionally positive messages like "just wait it'll be back to $1000 tomorrow," but just things like "wait it out guys, it's crashed before."
Meanwhile, posts like "we should have known it was never going to last, abandon ship!" were up at the top. Crazy.
I think a lot of people subscribed to this sub when it was spiking, and really, truthfully expected to make 10k-1mil in two or three month's time.
