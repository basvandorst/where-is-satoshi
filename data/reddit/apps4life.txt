As an app developer this is 100% spot on.

This deserves so much more attention than it's gotten but nobody wants it to be true because of what it would mean for the market. As long as everyone keeps marching to the tune, the 'scary thing' can't exist.

They aren't being paid for is the issue. They are printing 8-figures worth of them almost daily now.

People who _really_ understand what is happening here will short USDT and make a killing. Everyone else will keep pointing fingers and yelling 'FUD' so they don't have to face reality and can remain in their happy fantasy world where everything is always ethical and legitimate and nothing wrong ever happens.

Now I'm not at all saying that Venezuelans did this, just thinking hypothetically—with a satellite phone, you could use bitcoin freely without reliance on powergrids/cell-towers, assuming you can charge your phone (solar panel chargers exist as well).
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:56:08
But Scandinavian countries aren’t socialist?
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:49:33
I'm confused, if the power was down how were they accessing bitcoin? I'd say cellphones, but their entire power grid was down, meaning the cell towers weren't working either. Maybe if you had a satellite phone?

Get off your throne—it's insane that even when I take the precaution to preface the whole thing with the disclaimer that "`I'm just thinking hypothetically`", I still have to deal with r/IAmVerySmart comments like yours. There is no pleasing people like you, you just have to flex intellect, regardless of the content of a post. It doesn't come off as intelligent, it just comes off as obnoxious.

Meh, I have a few $100m+ friends and none of them do this or bat an eye and dropping $100s-$1000s on a meal, I think this is more so one obscure example, most uber rich people (at least that I know) don't act that frugal.

It's kind of hard to correlate the 2007 recession to Fed rate cut and not the housing crisis.

Right? Baffled by how many people see bitcoin as this temporary laundering unit. It’s like hearing if people in the 90s said “the point of email is to email your letter to the local post office who will transcribe it to pen and ink and mail it to your subject on your behalf”

It still doesn't *mean* that it is. It has a perfect track record but we are also talking a simple size of like 6 here, that's statistically insignificant.

I think with Augur you can actually "buy" this, in a sense. Doesn't it let you bid on things like future data points if you hook the contract up to said data source API.

Right off the bat anyone who stored bitcoin in Coinbase doesn't have access to bcash or bgold because they didn't have the keys during the HF. Store your bitcoins on your own private keys to fix that (in future HFs (hard forks))
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:38:16
Who said anything about buying eth [as an investment]? I develop on their platform because the concept of smart contracts are very valuable, as a developer, but I still use BTC for my store of valuable. 
Not sure what you mean about ignoring feedback, the Eth dev team has been really good at communicating and updating as well as addressing issues. I get the hunch you don’t actually actively follow the ETH project much
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:58:35
Sorry for the confusion, when I said it’s not about censorship I was referring to your statement “about censorship risk in code”. I fear there is censorship risk in governance and that’s what ethereum dapps defeat.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:17:17
I think we are talking about different things. I’m talking about decentralized dapps running on the Ethereum network
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:00:55
I think you're looking for r/politics
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:51:03
It's not about censorship, it's about decentralizing software. Twitter for example is one of the main discussion platforms in the world right now and is centralized, one person can decide to completely wipe out someone's reach just because they disagree with them. Building decentralized platforms is useful for that, so far Ethereum is one of the best approaches to doing so.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:37:14
No I mean like Twitter CEO entirely deleting someone’s account because they disagree with their political stance.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:36:02
Good argument.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:42:20
Obviously I’m talking about a Twitter-like platform on ETH. Not using Eth to restore a Twitter act. 
And again, early on it wasn’t scalable or efficient to send transactions via bitcoin vs just paying with a card. I’d have to stay in the store for half an hour while we wait. The goal is that these things get faster and better over time.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:59:57
I feel you should know I’m a programmer by trade and have launched a few dApps on Ethereum. I’m not just some schmuck giving into a marketing play. 
Anyways nothing I say will convince you about the value of decentralized smart contracts on Ethereum, you’re an ETH hater and I’m an ETH fan (and dev) so neither of us will convince each other the other way. 
Continuing this conversation will just result in hours of back and forth that go no where so I’m going to step back now
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:28:51
That’s a silly statement everyone says the same thing about Bitcoin early on, how can I ever pay with this it takes 30 min to get enough confirmations. The goal is that it all gets cheaper and faster over time. 
I already gave a good example of use case for dapps. Twitter censors. Twitter-like DApp on Ethereum solves that
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:34:53
No one said there is anything wrong with it. Just that that's not "what it's about".

@_date: 2019-12-17 15:30:06
Ethereum is a really good concept, I’m surprised how much hate it gets on r/Bitcoin - for a community that claims to be early adapters it can be pretty close minded.
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:41:04
Yeah I suppose you're right, I think the spirit of OPs message was "Bitcoin was not intended to be about \_\_\_".

@_date: 2018-11-16 21:39:01
I'm not assuming, you can see recent outgoing transactions on it? You're the one assuming lol, that when I checked the wallet to see the balance I didn't also glance down 5 pixels to note if any recent outgoing transactions occurred haha

Laissez-faire is the best way. Don't elect officials who run on the promise of taking money/resources from the haves and giving to the have-nots. etc
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:39:41
It would seem that way. Except it never is in practice. The poor in Zimbabwe are certainly worse off due to inflation. Maybe they had $1,000 and now they have $50Trillion, sounds great until $50T is now worth less than $1,000 was. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:38:44

Why does everyone always assume he used 100% of all the bitcoins he owned. I mean I've never read the story but for all you know he spent only 1% of his total bitcoins and is an anonymous billionaire. Any purchases we make with bitcoin now will look asinine 10 years from now as well once the value is 1000x
